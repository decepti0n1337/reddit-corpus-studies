And you think that gives you power over me?

I'm so happy cause that's my day off.

Eh modern barrens chat is mostly just twitch chat mixed with youtube comments
---
[removed]
---
Why thank you!
---
Windfury is better early on for warriors, however, kings scales better later. Windfury is also better for 2h wpns, but if you wanna dps was warrior, dual wielding is preferred.

&gt;a 15 year old game several months before it's even released

If I didn't know the context of this statement, I'd have thought you were talking about Star Citizen... :o
---
Dumbest thing I’ve read today.  And there have been a lot of them today.  If somebody is too big of an idiot to know when they need to sleep, then they’re literally too stupid to be alive.  
---
Wondering if I just fell for the bait or not... thinking this has to be a troll post as I’m writing this...
---
Not a Chuck Norris reference in sight :(
---
On dual Dawn's Edge, I miss these days.
---
We are not talking 72 hours, we are talking 120+ hours.
---
You just take an elite hit squad of mages and locks to spread their turbo aids from up high and sow chaos and destruction among their ranks. You could take some hunters too as cannon fodder.
---
Yeah I think any maximum damage scenario is not gonna have kiting.  I mean, I could see some crazy-perfect stutter stepping -- MAYBE --  but even then, the enemy would probably have to be slowed a lot.  I spent a long time trying to find info on this online and really struggled, and I assume that's because you just flat out don't kite as rogue for damage.  It's just kiting for kiting's sake situationally.
---
I am interested. Discord is deeyaz#1038
---
Not sure if this is a troll attempt or someone seriously believes Joana did 1-60 in a single sitting.
---
Only the ham ones, though.
---
Huh what are ya on mayte the best players on the beta are flipping ranked glads in retail?? Snutz venruki Sonni
---
Who the fuck cares?  You don’t tell adults when to go to bed.  Mind your own damn business.
---
Seriously, it's fine to dislike retail, but if there's one thing that it does light-years better than classic is the difficulty of raid encounters. If a person had trouble with bosses in classic I would hate to see them try to down a boss like mythic KJ from ToS or mythic Mekatorque from BoD. Method makes them look easy but that's only because they are insanely good at the game.
---
1.12 Lupos was just cosmetic wasn't it?
---
Perhaps /u/TheRealRecollector might want to consider adding an edit to make themselves look less stupid.
---
No problem, another point I'd like to make is that although enh is probably the more efficient leveling spec for shaman due to less downtime drinking. Elemental is probably fine if you are mostly leveling together. Plus the added benefit is that you wouldn't have to devote bag space for a different set of gear just to heal. Just food for thought.
---
I thought it was lights out in your eyes , either way means the same
---
Restating opinions that honestly make very little sense, and repeatedly posting one of many definitions for a word is rather pointless.
---
&gt;Difficult to understand or solve
---
&gt;needing much effort or skill to accomplish, deal with, or understand.
---
Which part of farming herbs is the above?
---
Which part of killing mobs one at a time while levelling using 1-2 buttons is the above?
---
Which part of mindlessly putting more time in is the above?
---
Which part of 'building' your resistance sets (aka mindlessly farming) is the above?
---
WHich part of "build your character funds" (aka mindless farming) is the above?
---
Which part of "buy mounts etc" (aka mindless farming) is the above?
---
&gt;The entry point though without question is, and someone stating otherwise is simply not being honest with what the experience is.
---
You make a blanket statement, and I quote "Classic is harder by definition because it requires more effort and endurance..."
---
You cannot now come and say well ackshually classic isn't harder but the levelling is 'harder' so what i said as a general sweeping statement is true.
---
&gt;Harder doesn't mean bad, harder doesn't mean it's a negative shot at the game or the experience.
---
Who are you speaking to? Nobody stood by this position or stated the above.
---
Are you just spewing out buzzwords you think will appeal to the people here? Seems like it.
---
&gt;I welcome this change and the sense of accomplishment that comes with it,
---
Yes, I'm sure you feel very accomplished after mindlessly farming lashers for hours to buy a mount.
---
Others might find themselves very accomplished after spending dozens of hours downing a complicated mythic raid boss, and earning a mount by doing so.
---
I would say that anyone with common sense would say that the latter is harder than mindlessly farming.
---
&gt;but indicating it doesn't require more time and effort
---
Again, nobody stated this. Simply that your chosen definition for harder is misleading, and rather myopic/stupid.
---
More time spent doing an easy and repetitive task does not = harder in the commonly used expectation of the word to describe difficulty in a video game. 
---
You probably wouldn't call Azerite World Quests difficult, would you? Yet doing every quest on your characters every day would require a lot of time and effort.
---
Classic is not hard. Classic is easy. Classic is a time sink. Classic is fun.
---
Stop trying to pretend its actually difficult.
---
Jeez. I just leveled a human warrior to lvl 19 without any deaths. No help from my main with gear either.
---
gl getting that thing fixed.
---
I'd enjoy them as it's an alternate grind at end game.
---
Ranged classes can solo stuff by abusing pathing and kiting things constantly (this is what people mean when they say solo Dire Maul - it's an instance with easily abusable pathing). Some things can be solo'd through tank/healing/dps combination but it depends a lot on gear level and the exact boss where that is possible. Dire Maul is pretty hard, I doubt any class in any gear could straight up solo it. Maybe a pally or druid or spriest in Naxx gear I guess? Most other dungeons like strat/brd/scholo have a pretty wide range of boss/trash difficulty so there's going to be some things that aren't too hard but others that are impossible.
---
Hellfire Peninsula was planned for vanilla? Do you have a source?
---
They should have an increased chance to miss too though? What about casters they arent affected by glancing blows either?
---
Yes. And it runs better than vanilla clients do even now. Much much better.
---
Frost mages AOE very well. Hunters have a very tough pet that can handle a lot of elites and they have 'feign death' to skip straight to boss rooms at times for the boss drops. 
---
Mages don't kill bosses really, just trash mobs. 
---
Dire Maul East is a popular farm spot but I don't think it's good for hunters.  Only frost mages, holy nova priest, prot paladin.. 
---
Any class can farm like, scarlet monastery or RFD if you wanted to- with varying levels of effectiveness.
---
Awesome! Really well made, I hope something at least like it ends up being in the game eventually.
---
Edit: Word choice.
---
Warlocks have really durable pets and tons of sustainability, plus fear as a reliable CC if you pull the monsters very far back.
---
He just wishes he died in *Ronin*.
---
Joana didn't but when Vanilla hits people will attempt the race to 60. The fastest recorded time we have was by Joana so I am using it as a reference.
---
enchanting requires lots of random greens to disenchant- in which case you can do OK soloing regular (or elite) humanoids.  They drop coin, cloth, and a good chance at greens.
---
"OrAnGe MaN bAd lulw 5head" 
---
Yeah I would absolutely block world and trade chat. Maybe even General.
---
Coast of wetlands is good for strangle kelp, firefins, and some oily blackmouths too.
---
Sure, they miss a bit more than they would against same level enemies, but when they do hit then they do full damage.
---
Spell hit falls off faster against higher level enemies.  Casters will miss a lot more than attackers.
---
They do have an increased chance to miss. It's just different formulas for ranged attacks and spells and melee attacks. In practice it just means if you're attacking something 15 levels above you hunter is going to do 10x more damage than anyone else. It's not a 'bug', it's just way vanilla was.  
---
  
---
In a server where you're not artificially level capped it doesn't matter at all.
---
I knew you were a fucking incel gamer! Hahaha bro you’re a goldmine.
---
Orc stun resistance is invaluable when dealing with warriors and rogues.
---
Wield a bulky 2 handed axe to get the most sting out of your raptor strike before breaking away to range.  Most people don't expect a 1k+ melee crit when attempting to deadzone you.  Arcanite Reaper ftw!  
---
The extra pet damage is nice too.  
---
Orc all the way for pvp.
---
equilibrium.
---
this streamer must be high on cocaine or something whats up with him
---
I don't think Devilsaur Mafia became a thing until private servers. I haven't seen any reference to it from Vanilla and all video I have seen when people mention it is private server.
---
I will give you a very honest answer here. Some of the past private servers for classic have been in a very great state. You had a chance to do the content many times over.
---
TBC is something new and introduced only few things that were bad for the game, while improving in a lot of areas over classic.
---
The TBC private servers have all disappointed sooner or later with no exceptions.
---
If I were Blizzard I would merge the playerbase into a super server when individual servers start dying post Naxx. And I would release TBC and allow for a one time copy from classic to TBC to continue your journey.
---
Meanwhile they should start new servers in classic after two or so years. And people can either do TBC, or do classic. And in parallel play on the super server whenever they like. It’s OK if the economy is super broken. That server would be a heaven for PvP events.
---

Because Chuck Norris chooses not to be referenced right now.
---
I camped for the dark blue raptor in barrens can't remember it's name
---
&gt; Warriors are tanks only
---
What?
---
No skilled player or min-maxer would say that. Fury is quite possibly the #1 DPS spec in the game.
---
Why do you care?
---
Yes he can, There's no need for him to die.
---
A few days ago someone said that it was flying mounts that killed the game. A few days before that someone said it was Wrath dailys. By extrapolation I can safely state that by Friday the thing that ruined WoW was when it was launched and no longer Warcraft III custom maps.
---
Same way hunters could. Pet tanking and kiting. Difference is no feigned death so you have to be more careful/slower.
---
Meh it would be a fairly valid concern if there was a million dollar reward for hitting 60 first. Like other darwin award competitions such as touch the car the longest or drink the most water.  
---
When there's no actual competition organised by anyone though yeah this is a stupid hyper nanny state concern.
---
You described it brilliantly - I was part of one of the rogue "strike teams", and our objective was always to simply try to sneak push a tower or GY away from the frontlines - we often came across the same group of smarter alliance players who figured out what we were trying to do - and then it sort of became a battle within a battle, little skirmishes away from the frontline meatgrinder - great stuff.
---
But wasn't like, Arthas going out with Jaina until they both realised he's gay?
---
Mythic raiders are all bored as fuck on BfA because mythic raiding has no rewards besides a slightly different transmog that loses uniqueness in several months.
---
Underrated thanking

I was going to say sometimes you got to let the Alliance know who's alpha...But I like this response better.
---
&gt; /u/TreantGlass Who? And no the idea came from southpark http://southpark.cc.com/full-episodes/s10e08-make-love-not-warcraft
---
This comment can't be serious LOL. Dude, of course south park sparked the meme of leveling by killing level 1 boars. Everyone knows that. Of course, the idea is nonsense because you stop gaining experience from those boars once they turn grey. Nobody after seeing that episode went out and hit max level by killing boars. 
---
Recently, the meme gained traction again because [YouTuber Classic Winds unveiled a plan to actually go 1-60 with boars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6HRWDpMvxM). If there's evidence of someone coming up with this idea before him please link it. He announced plans that he is going to begin to start this challenge run once classic launches. However, the OP decided to start his own challenge run, undoubtedly using the route Classic Winds showcases. It's disingenuous to jump the gun on someone else's idea.
---
Wahhhhh my video game is stressful
---
Not too terrible.
---
Nah I’m good
---
People don't agree with me how toxic!
---
What?  They were like 1-2g in Vanilla.
---
I meant after RFK, there are boars in RFD too
---
That's why I like bootleg wow.  It's fun to game with 4chan and Russia every now and again..
---
Taunt is a bit of a red herring, IMO. It's useful for sure, but I almost never used it in TBC (yes, even with the target-of-target macro). Not trying to pat myself on the back; the point is that lack of taunt is not the real reason Prot Pallies weren't a thing in Vanilla. 
---
The biggest problems were lack of mana regen (Spiritual Attunement) for sustained threat generation and just itemization overall. AOE thorns grinding to 60 in TBC is a fun way to level, but it's slow and methodical. At level 61, when you start amassing spell plate questing in Outland, there is a noticeable difference in ability to actually AOE things. Consecration also becomes a bit more mana efficient.
---
For the nipple!  Errr... I mean alliance!
---
Silvermoon, but for Classic Stormwind.
---
I think I only made it to lvl 11 in FFXI before my friend showed me WoW and I don't even want to think about EQ. People forget that WoW was the first true casual MMO.
---
When guilds first started on naxx black lotus prices soared. Chinese gold farmers cornered the market. They were at minimum 200g on my server... if there were any.
---
Lmao
---
Plz blizz give me fishing on a WoW Classic Mobile app.
---
No way that's only you... He's the best pet on a pvp server because of his attack speed.
---
Came here to say this
---
You're spot on, but in my opinion the argument still stands. Similar to how Jagex handled Old School Runescape, I think that taking feedback from the community on important changes, sometimes even improvements (gasp) from the old version, can be done so long as a majority approves. In this case, I always felt a bit more immersed when I had to head to a specific location to battle there, and it offers some interesting opportunities for world pvp.
---
Fucking ogre quest is always so full of horde it’s almost not worth doing
---
They are objectively more complex. Remember "more complex" doesn't necessarily mean "complex" or even "better" (though I personally prefer the old trees).
---
51 points spent in branching trees spread out over three different "specs" is more complex than choosing one spec and then choosing a few passive/active abilities.
---
So True!
---
Thanks for stealing the post I was about to write.
---
But why male models?
---
The world is better off without anyone that would die from this.  Let Darwin do his thing.
---
Flasks in Vanilla were not something you used every raid. They were used for a handful of bosses with tight timers (Patchwerk, Loatheb, C'Thun) and that's about it.
---
Unless you farm 3+ hours a day, no one can afford Flasks for every raid, nor should they be expected to.

If you think more people are going to be playing classic than there will be playing retail you are a delusional man.

No reason for concern. They would pass out long before they die. Also it would take much longer than you are saying with sleep deprivation their efficiency will go down dramatically.

If Moria can be overtaken by Goblins then I think Iron Forge can be taken by orcs.  But real talk IF is just fucking ridiculous when it comes to defense.  And in order to successfully seige it you would have to also seige stormwind due to the tram
---
I know, but they may move that shit over to classic, who knows. In any case, it was just a joke. I certainly hope it never becomes a real thing in classic. I won’t be doing any skinning myself, but I hate when a small group of people try to ruin everyone else’s fun and opportunities.
---
Why do you care?  Even if there was someone dumb enough to try... Fuck'em.
---
What were the changes from pre 1.12 av to 1.12 av?
---
Thats it I'm going horde.
---
To mature people.
---
Don't tell that to the pserver crowd. According to them, warriors are godmode and destroy all other things in all things.  
---
Tbh though, warriors are pretty awesome in PvE.
---
LITERALLY SHUT UP. the amount of people trying to control this experience for everyone else is fucking wild. JUST PLAY THE FUCKING GAME HOW YOU WANT TO

No, it went over his head too.... why do you think he doesn't know lol

dont forget Druidboyz!

I "should" play the beta, but... no inv.

for your sake I hope you’re a troll because otherwise you might be one of the dumbest people i’ve ever encountered online
---
Sean Bean rarely dies at the start of movies, it's always near the end
---
Beta testers aren't paid, if Blizz wants them to do something specific besides playing the game then they need to do exactly what they're doing now with AV.
---
Content and chance at "making it" both have monetary rewards. People have done crazier things for much less.
---
I almost wish they would have just called it WoW 2, and made it "like Vanilla", so they could just pick all the best aspects of it.  Then they would have had free reign to do whatever neat changes they wanted.
---
After playing on TBC retail for the whole duration of it being live and also playing private servers. So combining all that time,even after 6 years of playing TBC, i still think TBC is way better than any other expansion and also Classic. I'm basicly hyping Classic for the possibility that Classic is a sucsess and Blizzard decides to make TBC like they are now doing for Classic.
---
You could say in short that. I've made TBC exactly what people remember/know what Classic were. I'm as excited for **Latro's Shifting Sword** like people are for **Ashkandi** or **Arcanite Reaper**.
---
I'm excited that i can play any class and spec and know i bring something unique that is valuable for others that i play with. Like a Retribution Paladin, Simply existing with Sanctity Aura gives their groups a 2% damage increase. And their Judge of the Crusader gives the whole raid 3% higher chance to Crit on the target. That's Huge.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
But to bring up just a few points i think is what's good with TBC.
---
More indepth raid enviorments. Classic raids enviorments are extremly static.
---
Boss mechanics in both dungeons and raids are more mechanically difficult.
---
Questing hubs. Even if i personally hate questing. I'm still excited to quest in Terrokar Forest or Netherstorm again after doing more than a dozen times.
---
More, lasting Profession choices with prof special bonuses(Ring enchants, Unique Gems, Mooncloth Set, etc)
---
Both Draenei and Blood Elf have good racials and opens up both factions to get Shaman and Paladin.
---
Flying was cool, it made the world a bit safer, which is a bummer. But i still think it has a valuable role in the entierty of what is the expansion The Burning Crusade
---
Yeah but could you jump from the deck to the roof of the stairwell (that leads below deck) on your first try?
---
You will meet people through leveling and such. Join a guild and make some friends! The best thing about Classic WoW that retail cant touch is its a new server. No one is ahead of you right now. No need to play catch up.
---
Only his career dies in The Martian
---
Not a troll, just don't want Classic WOW to end up on the evening news  for the wrong reasons. And have a stupid #something movement afterwards.
---
Karazhan is the best raid in WoW history. I don't necessarily want to see a direct copy of TBC, but I want to see Karazhan at some point in Classic.
---
I just got boss aggro from laughing at this
---
Edit: at work\*
---
Having a tough time deciding between lock and mage. Mostly pve focus but would like to wpvp/bg occasionally. 
---
I like lock for the utility but feel like grinding for ss/no mobility will burn me out eventually over the course of classic.
---
Mage is better pve dps, overall better in pvp, more utility but lacks the uniqueness of warlock. Also will be dime a dozen in every dungeon, raid, or bg
---
Lolololol
---
You can either make a design choice that will give a small amount of players a bit of extra "pride" in their character, but will be an annoyance or even a complete turn-off to everyone else.
---
Or you can make a choice that is extremely useful, and even necessary, to the large majority of players, and will still give people who don't want to use it the option not to.
---
It's not much a choice, and it's simply good game design.
---
I was always a fan of mara. It was a very pretty and fantastical dungeon. Almost majestic. I also dig the verticality of it
---
Has to be trolling?
---
I envy you and your online encounters.
---
If they scaled that trilogy into a single movie then boromir probably isnt even on it
---
Listen... there isn't a good class to do this on; let's be honest.
---
Elon musks’ The Boaring Company
---
Baron on youtube.
---
It actually is..It procs off of rank 1 moonfire so you'll see some hybrid druid use it early on with a spellpower enchant. Early on their isnt many good 1handers for druids so they like to use this dagger and pair it with skull of impending doom and medicine pouch. But you say it's not good so you must be right.
---
How so?
---
just a heads up, the 3k number includes horde and alliance and both continents. so 2 full layers would be 6k people
---
We still end up spending close to 600g for all the materials and such. Sure it’s not 1k but it’s still not anything to sneer at
---
Dailies fucking sucked. If you didn't do them every day you weren't spending time close to optimally, but they were boring AF.

[deleted]
---
Well yeah, Joana has seemingly made a 'career' off it before it was really even a thing in vanilla.     
---
    
---
You can't really expect blizzard to police it though, that would just be stupid. Video games have goals and content that takes hundred+ hours. If people want to race to achieve them that's on those people.  
---
At the same time yes playing for that long is dangerous, and yes someone will die eventually on stream with people watching from DVT. It might not be this year or decade, but eventually it will happen 100%. When that does happen it will be interesting to see what the reaction is from twitch/devs/community.
---
If you set the bar low enough
---
Pretty sure we were widely known on Wildhammer as the guild with poor raid progression that drank too much while raiding.
---
Friends don't make friends play horde. Horde is more of a family. Ya know, the kind of people you can't seperate from, but you would kill if you could get away with it.  
---
Alliance is like living with Ned Flanders: "Howdy Neighbor!"  
---
...pick your poison
---
So it's for twinking, which I mentioned earlier. Not at all worth getting if you're just leveling.
---
Yes, but you aren't tanking raid bosses as a Paladin anyway so parry haste really shouldn't be a consideration.
---
Sounds cool. I'll be watching you, bro. Good luck!
---
Not that many people care about hunter pets. Or hunters in general.
---
Just hunters probabaly
---
I don't think it will be. Just use SnD with your first combo points. Then again, it's your character, the racial won't be everything. Build how you want. Also, consider orc.
---
I would say there's a 100% certainty that the average mythic clearing raider in retail has much more mechanical / reactionary skill than the best of the best private server players. But mechanical and reactionary skill don't really matter in vanilla. It's all about time investment and an extremely hard to aquire knowledge gap of class and game mechanics. This is why hardcore mythic raiding guilds from retail that roll on classic will fail to get world firsts by a huge margin. 
---
Nothing against the players or organizations involved, but it's naive to think that years of vanilla min/max experience can be trumped by raw skill in a game that doesn't require it. Their only chance honestly is recruiting one of the best private server raiding teams and rebranding them under their organization. I could actually see that happening before I could see 40 people from retail trying to learn everything they need to know in such a short time with no practical way to practice.
---
You're overthinking it.  
---
Make two characters, one a mage and one a warlock. Pick the one with the best name and graphics.  
---
Go have fun.
---
XD
---
You realize that’s 5 full in game days ? It’s not just staying up for 5 days, you’d have to be efficient leveling for 5 consecutive days straight. It’s simply not possible.
---
Fuck you OP. If I want to sit in front of my computer for 20 hours with a shit bucket underneath my chair I will god damn do so BECAUSE THIS IS AMERICA
---
Oh NICE! I haven't seen this before. Thanks!
---
Lol, no. The layering will only be for a few weeks to help alleviate the pain of everyone being in the starting zones. The no-lifers will pull ahead, get to 60 and find nothing to do beyond getting attuned, farming for their epic mount and getting into MC. Only the hardcore of the hardcore will manage this in the first month to their own detriment. Grinding out the content as fast as possible with high burnout isn't that sustainable.   
---
The rest of the player base will still be leveling. Many people won't hit 60 by Phase 2 if it's going to drop 2 months in. PvP will happen as people level because PvP itself is fun. There was PvP action before the honor system in Vanilla and there will be PvP before the Honor system drops in Classic. Tarren Mill will have lowbies throwing themselves at it while STV will be a hot bed of activity as it's always been in Vanilla.
---
Or you know, 2004 summer beta, and stopped playing in WotLK.
---
Your complaints about upgrades and your insistence on playing rogue implied the solo route. If you are grouping just run a dungeon or 2.
---
All I was saying is that rogues have way more survivabability with a massive toolkit to kill and escape death.
---
Warriors on the other hand can win 1 fight every 30 mins, and then are back to long slogs with no escapes if they pull a second mob, or get jumped on a PvP server.
---
The community as a whole has long since established and confirmed, objectively, that warrior is the least forgiving and hardest class to level. But by all means act like a HUGE cock when you clearly aren't following  all of the first hand accounts from vanilla, thepast 6 years of pservers, and most of the beta streamers to date.
---
Wait, is this real? I mean you are either a sarcastic genius or batshit crazy.
---
Anduin the Andal
---
If an item has Unique on it's card, you can only own 1 on the character. Equipped, bags, or in the bank. 
---
Unique-Equipped was added later to allow characters to own more than 1 at a time. This really helped out crafting.
---
After flip flopping for weeks I think I’ve finally decided on Paladin. I love the class fantasy and I want to heal while still being able to hit things with a sword. 
---
My main concern at the moment is world pvp while leveling. I know palys can take a lot of damage but will I be able to actually kill anyone or should I just focus on escaping?
---
Also which spec is most fun while leveling?
---
I prefer Alliance aesthetics and Ironforge, but the big draw for me is dwarves. I love playing those stalwart, gruff, loyal dudes in every game. If Horde had dwarves, I'd be playing Horde, but alas, they don't.
---
Given the massive hype the past few weeks it sounds like it's guaranteed at this point unless they forget about it.

Best answer.
---
Thank god
---
Damn that music is trash. Not as trash as your video, but it’s very close.
---
4 hrs a day is kinda low. OSRS people played around 6 hrs a day and there was a good amount of people playing this much. Same demographic but people found a way to out in the hours.
---
It’s not a lie bro. Seriously 
---
[Frostadamus’ grind spot vid](https://youtu.be/JHe6DXBeGIE) 
---
It’s a decent spot.
---
I regularly play Shaman, but my friends all want to go Alliance, which is fine with me, but I’m left trying to pick a class. Neither Paladin or Druid sit well with me, so the only healer I’m left with is Priest. 
---
I’m torn between rolling a Human/Night Elf Priest and returning to my healing ways, or going with a Human Warlock, as I had tons of fun with a Warlock on a Pserver.
---
If it helps, my buddy and future PvP partner is an Arms Warrior.
---
They made the announcement about not being sure before WoW Classic exploded in popularity (100k+ viewers on twitch). They were likely just worried about server population sizes.
---
Look at all that fish this bait caught. 
---
If anyone is going over 4 days straight without logging out once, it is more than likely it's a team of people switching on and off taking shifts. 
---
Also this is reddit, not blizzard. And to answer your request, no.
---
Cross-realm BGs. They were fine in classic. You'll get to know the people in your BG group just fine. While the idea of people being phased in and out from different servers while leveling sounds awful.
---
Warrior Class quest trinket is easily BiS for any fight under 1 minute until AQ. [https://classicdb.ch/?item=20130](https://classicdb.ch/?item=20130)

Stop.
---
Good
---
I'd be pretty nifty if players scaled with level like Hunter pets do.
---
Weirdo
---
Never played the game. Is he referencing starter quests in the episode haha?
---
Private server experience. As paladin I can solo tank ubrs no problem. Barely drink but this is in full T1. I had tanked it as a fresh sixty with 2 tanks and while I did have to drink every once in a while, it wasn't too much downtime. You get better with your Mana management the more you do it and the better your gear is.
---
Without an addon, there's no way for this to work for Classic. Classic doesn't have any web APIs.
---
They didn't 14 years ago so I don't see why they should now.
---
Whats wrong with PvP on a PvP server? If i wanna play some world PvP and i know where a certain person is located because he exposed his location by streaming, i dont see anything wrong with ganking him.
---
And this is why im on the fence about ever getting a tattoo...
---
I've never ever heard of this. No one ever gave a fuck if you popped a pot in BGs or WorldPvP. They'd just be salty that killing you takes a bit longer. From what I remember, you could buy BG specific pots with honor too.
---
&gt;every class is so similar and lacking in unique utility
---
small brain alert
---
the rogues are there specifically because of the unique utility they bring in the form of shroud skips and it's actually become a big problem for anyone trying to do a key without a rogue
---
Next expansion: Rise of the True Lich King
---
Anduin chases Sylvannas to Northrend where he meets a familiar face (Bolvar) who through some means transfers the Lich King to Anduin. 
---
End of expansion, Anduin: Father...is it over?
---
Arthas: At long last. No king rules forever my son.
---
Anduin: I see. Only darkness before me.
---
/s
---
Oof, I don't need DVTs bro, I gotta draw the line somewhere.
---
Do you believe there will be any addons to track quests completed?
---
This. But shhh, no one tell him how easy it is to kite a shaman as literally any other class.
---
Take your big government shit elsewhere.
---
No.
---
On pservers the factions usually balance out.
---
oh man seconds after i posted a big gov blast on him. haha +1
---
My condolences. I fully support your endeavors in honoring her.
---
I mean... with the ‘norm’ logic you’re using here couldn’t we just look at beta and see that 99% of the time people can kite the 5 yard range without hitting or being hit and claim that it’s not in the game? 
---
That’s kind of silly...
---
how is a bunch of lvl 58 characters gonna be representative of AV?? give them decent MC/BWL comparable gear at lvl 60, that will give much more accurate data.
---
I am talking about level 60 you dumb fuck.
---
Dumbledore dies.
---
And is gay.
---
Anything in shimmering flats
---
I abandoned all quests in the area because it is nothing but slow pointless grind without anything dropping.
---
Unless the private server community flock to a few specific servers. We definitely need a list of private server realms so we can stay clear of them.
---
Method had people playing 16 hours a day for more than a month running island expeditions to grind their neck levels up. I think method can do grinding just fine
---
No clue. But it's probably not a priority for anyone.
---
World first KT was post-2.1. Consumables were changed in 2.1.
---
Id rather see players have to go to the actual location.
---
don't kite. stunlock mobs if that's your style and don't stop autoattacking
---

20 hours is not a problem .... 100+ might be as some of you will end up in a hospital I am paying for.

And why are you so mad, blood pressure?

YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES this is your golden ticket
---
Rested bonus exp won't be in Phase 1
---
TBH all horde are the same kind of hot
---
Wait.. what trinket? Is this in latet phases?
---
WoW has usermade addons that help you to filter out/limit your exposure to folks that actively break the RP immersion so that's not too big of a deal.
---
Why are you the way you are?
---
Dew laden gland tanaris. Once grinded it for 3-4 hours. I'm particularly unlucky though.
---
Here's a video of it in action https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVP7UkwB_Fs
---
Hahahaha I was actually looking at monsters in certain zones to see if there was a possibility of living in one area. When you thoroughly explore one area you find so much cute new shit, it's mad successful in OSRS.
---
I think it would be cool to add something like that, but then, it wouldn’t be classic. ;)
---
It varied by server/battlegroup. I remember that my Paladin would Solo SM Cath at 60 and start my AV queue at the same time and it would pop just after I finished. Maybe around 40 minutes. Played on Gilneas, can't remember the BG, though.
---
be a hunter and quit your job. otherwise enjoy the process
---
Hunter would be the easiest probably with warlock a close second. He might not even be able to do the RFK part as a warrior at all.
---
Yes Joana did it in several IRL days that was only 5 in game days. People will try to get to 60 in one sitting as a challenge, content, or whatever. There is money at stake. Imagine 72 hours in and there are 5-10 streamers still going at it.... it will become a spectacle and people will get hurt.
---
Okay you call them sissies but at lower levels when all PVP is just a numbers game, who in their right mind is gonna keep queuing to get pummeled?
---
You know whats really hard? Doing mythic Mekatorque while juggling 3 eggs in your left hand.
---
And yet, nobody would give a fuck about watching you do it.
---
Nobody cares about BFA anymore.

Hunter is the best class for PVP. PERIOD.

I know people will argue me on this one, but there is no class that is more dynamic. Viper sting biggest utility against mana classes. Traps are extremely dynamic for pvp.

Not sure how it is "controlling" ..... a limit that would trigger once you cross some astronomical number like say 72 hours is not really controlling.....

---
World buffs should not work inside instances or battlegrounds, only self/party buffs and flasks. That’s how I would balance it personally
---
Dwarf for fear ward and desperate prayer
---
Thats not true. Mages can still be easily fucked with if youre BM. I have more problems vs warlocks or spriests.
---
And then you have to figure in that the horde don't have a FP close to the duskwood dragon, and stuff like that so you're travelling with a raid group to get there.
---
Yeah it's been a while since I watched the video but the RFK part is killing those elite boars in RFK, I wouldn't be surprised if he couldn't even kill one by himself as a warrior.
---
That's why they're setting this up so it's the only thing you can play
---
I was under the impression he used to do shadow damage until aq patch, i never messed with him when vanilla was retail but did on a couple private servers and that was the case
---
should only take like 6 days total played to reach 60 I am pretty sure I did that before fallowing a guide without trying to be completely optimal. I have this as long as my work doesn't call my ass in off hours. 10 hours a day who needs sleep? I did it on a warrior if I remember correctly and I am pretty sure it was before tbc was released. I remember doing 40-50 in a day took like 20 hours friends were shocked when they got back on and saw me 50. joana was the best game guide I ever saw and I have compared every guide to it since. EDIT- then again new populated server might add a day to it who knows i had free reign and no competition when I did the warrior this is going to be completely different maybe 2-2.5 weeks?
---
WotLK was pretty awful. It's much more similar to current retail than it is to TBC or Vanilla.
---
I think people remember WotLK fondly because that's when WoW was at its peak. But the game was only in that position in the first place because of the foundation laid by Vanilla and TBC.
---
I would like you people who have more experience in vanilla to give me some advice, I can't decide which class to main as my first character for PvE, PvP and solo gold farming (when friends are not online)
---
1. I will play Alliance.
---
2. A class can (safely or easily) solo PvE/gold farming and world pvp.
---
3. A class that is needed for dungeon or raid group.
---
Thinking about choosing one between Warlock, Hunter or Rogue, but..
---
Hunter: seems to be hated by most of the players? It's good for solo but not needed for dungeons? And rogues seem to be the biggest problem in PvP (dead zone and stun lock)?
---
Rogue: everyone is playing rogue, is it good for solo gold farming (without self healing or a pet tanking for me)?
---
Warlock: seems the perfect choice for me but the downside is alliance warlock is not very good for PvP...? and there are solo many undead rogues, fear becomes useless.
---
Would love to hear your thoughts, what's the best one that suits my play style? thanks!
---
Nothing will beat IF like it was back in the day. Peak flourish.
---
Especially since I'm sure his gear is lackluster due to... you know... only killing boars.
---
It's 1.12. AV
---
So one items is useful for 1 class, for very specific fights, so make the class quests useless and too late to matter? There are plenty of items people get earlier on that are still usefully for a while. There's a mage offhand available at lvl 40 and usable in naxx.
---
In some ways paladin is actually better off in this regard then paladin.  You will almost for sure find a raid as ele/resto shaman, but for progression or hordecore guilds they will pressure you into deep resto for mana tide as it is quite a good ability with a lot of raid utility.  
---
Holy paladin only needs the first 20 points in holy for 95% of your raid healing, and 30 points for 100%.  Holy shock is not really a pve heal, although you might use it while moving there are very few mobility fights in vanilla.  
---
This gives you a lot of options on what to do with those other 20+pts.  Holy shock is rather good offensive ability, so I like shockadin builds.  Shockadin is meme spec to be sure, it cannot pve has exploitable weaknesses in pvp, and cannot grind.  It is however quite a bit of burst out of a build that is capable of healing at the same time. 
---
 31/0/20 for seal of command and eye for an eye.  With T2(which is heavy on spell power), activated spell power trinkets, and any on use damage trinket.  
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/BJ808TQAAz8N8A
---
Video of someone doing it in original vanilla:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ay7RU0N-44Y&amp;feature=youtu.be 
---
There really isn't that much power gain on the above spec vrs the standard pvp holy build.  Something like: 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/BDzT9dAEP6QIwAA
---
You lose a bit of damage on judgement, but gain some +hit.  This is a less bursty, but perhaps slightly better at outlasting your opponent and has the group utility of imp freedom and imp conc aura.    
---
Before black wing raid, it can be difficult to find enough spell power plate to support the build, but in the video I linked the guy is mostly using a caster offhand to max his spellpower.  If you just wear a shield, you gainback enough armor that you can downgrade to leather/mail spellpower pieces in as many slots as possible. 
---
There is also an interesting build where you got most of the way down holy and most of the way down prot for reckoning.  You just turtle in healing gear most of the time and play as a regular healer.  Everytime you get crit hit, you gain a reckoning charge stacking upto 4.  Ideally you drop combat at some point and put on your full melee set with a 2h, and your first attack will hit the person 5 times gibbing them.  
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/Az_QxAQ_pA8wAA
---
I don't like this as much as shockadin, as gear swapping can be pretty hard to do so you end up missing opportunities, plus you don't really have the melee talents from ret so you wont hit THAT hard, so unless you get lucky and crit 2-3 of those attacks, you don't really have a followup to finish your target.  
---
I didn't play paladin early in vanilla,but I had a friend who played holy/reckoning before the famous reck nurf.  Back then you could store infinite charges and so if you turtled long enough you could one shot anyone.
---
Do you want your beloved game like Classic WOW be the "poster child"? I don't.
---
I had both at 60. I'll tell you that as a fresh 60, being a rogue is tough and being a warrior is great. For both, you'll be needing a lot of gear from places like strat, scholo, brd, and lbrs. Now, as a warrior, everyone wants you and you can make demands to take advantage of it. It is encouraged for some reason. You can reserve items and tell your group to pound sand if it's a deal breaker. 
---
As a rogue, you're on the opposite side. You're dependent on the tank, but the tank may reserve the only items you're after, or may simply say they don't want a rogue in group. You honestly cannot gear as a rogue without friends and guildies because in the pug world, everyone supports tanks reserving whatever they want. 
---
I had an easier time pugging a group as a fresh arms warrior reserving whatever I wanted than I did getting into a pug on my T1/T2 rogue without items I was after being reserved, requiring me to call on my guildies.
---
Counterpoint, you make lots of friends as a rogue within guild. Since you're dependent on favors, you get used to jumping at the requests of others. Soon enough you're loved. Gearing is still slow tho.
---
awesome
---
Yea like I said, if you’re raiding and MM you’re probably donezo. So nothing I said is untrue.
---
People are the plain stupid if they’re gonna compare themselves to 1 a speedrunner, and 2 somebody who’s done the leveling route 100s of times over. The average player will be 9-10 days in game, if dumbass’s want to stay up for 5 days let them have the heart attack.
---
For both PvE and PvP roll a shaman. Go with the Tauren if you want to primarily focus on PvP, as that stupid stun can save entire groups from certain death (aoe stun to prevent melee interrupts, then chain heal).  
---
Totems are OP when used correctly (learn totemweaving) and a well-played shaman is nearly unkillable 1v1.  
---
Downranked heal spells means you don't have to worry about mana (unlike priests) and the extra mail means melee dps can't kill you easily (unlike  priests).  
---
Then, if you pull healer aggro during an instance run, when you're at the very end, and you have pats behind you, and you die halfway through the final boss fight, you pop back up and keep healing. Because shaman.  
---
Someone else pulls aggro and starts running away from the tank? Frost shock, grounding totem, heal. Hell, throw in a lightning bolt in there.   
---
Pull too many adds to heal through? (Tauren) aoe stun. Chain heal. Grounding totem, kite extra adds. Tank is dying? Throw down a healing totem. Need more mana? Totem. Feel like doing some damage? Totem. Wanna dance while casting healing spells, then let your totems maintain while waiting for the 5 sec spirit regen to kick in? You can do that.  
---
What do priests have? A soft bubble?  Paladins laugh at their stupid bubble. Big heals? Go oom. HoT? Please, you've got a totem for that - which heals everyone, and then you chain heal. Everyone. So no need for silly HoT's.  
---
Cloth? Gotta fight mages and warlocks for that? No thanks. A nice wand drops? You gonna get that? Nope. Went to a Mage. An Ankh drops? Eh, sure, I'll take that. Because shaman. Healing shield? Heh. I don't see a paladin around here, guess that'll come in handy. Mail with in/spirit? Leather with int/Spirit? The only thing you can't wear is plate. And who needs that? Not shamans...
---
Yeah he wont have any thing at all hardly, warrior was probably one of the worst class choices unfortunately, maybe the only worse class would be a rogue.
---
Still have mine :) I had to make a trial account and level up a horde and summon.. Good fun
---
Only problem is the damage is not what its cut out to be. The faster the attack speed, the lower the damage, so it equalizes out at the end and only with talents does it put it at a slight advantage.
---
Cats by far out DPS every other pet including the wind serpent mainly because of having both claw and rake as energy dumps. While the serpent costs 50 focus to shoot electricity
---
Fuck those hooves. I specifically remember taking almost an entire week of casual play trying to get those fuckers. Hours and hours went into slaughtering countless zhevera.
---
Can’t wait to level with ambience and music!

Well... he hopefully has a good amount of green leather what-with all that leatherworking he is doing.

Hey guys!  So some back story here, I used to farm a ton in vanilla when I wasnt raiding.
---
By the time mid 2005 came, I had around 20k raw gold and another 10k+ in sellable materials from the many different  farms I used to do. 
---
I've decided ill be going over  many different  possible  ways to obtain  gold in classic, as well as other classic content.
---
If there is something specific you guys would want to see, let me know :D
---
Figured I'd  start off with probably  one of the  more important  farms leading up for molten core  
---
Elemental  Fire
---
https://youtu.be/H-aB6RfXa_s
---
Dwarf gets fear ward and plays along side pallys. Troll gets a 20% MS at almost no mana cost, a shadow damage shield (that can stun if spec'd accordingly) and you play alongside shamadins. Also, troll looks super cool.
---
Says September 9th with 15 hour days, so 2 weeks on the dot. Hopefully I'm faster than that lol, seems like a lot of time investment but not as fast as I hoped.
---
Meanwhile players that are very familiar with it / that leveled multiple 60s on private servers will do it in about 6 days played. The best of the best will do it in 4 days played. 
---
My only hope for the unfamiliar players on the normal leveling curve is that phase 2 isn't dropped until after the majority of them are 60. Otherwise the PVP honor system being implemented will make their life a living hell. Every contested flight path will be camped by groups of opposing faction. Every zone will be as unsafe as STV on a bad day. Every dungeon entrance a warzone. The system will reward ganking people that award honor. Which is anyone level 48+? 52+? Something like that. Very bad time. Good luck. 
---
TL;DR Highly recommend rolling on a PVE server if you're an unfamiliar player. Otherwise your game experience might be hell when phase 2 drops.
---
It's a quote by Randy when he explains the game to his co-worker.

Those are two very tempting options, is there a third? As much as I would love to claim "sarcastic genius" award unfortunately this is actually a serious post.
---
Stupid dog! You made me look bad!
---
It’s in the beta
---
So you think a weapon that AT BEST gives nothing more than 3.33 DPS and 16.6 MP5 is so much better than all these weapons that it's worth paying someone to farm a 2% drop for you while you wait:

You should have streamed this or are you making a montage vid? I wish I could give you more upvotes for the live to win loop
---
If it's the eastern most alliance foothold, and everything beyond it is neutral or horde controlled, then it does watch the east.
---
Yeah classic might have been rushed but they definitely nailed the aesthetic that the alliance are more established and wherever you go is kind of comfortable whereas The horde are fighting for survival
---
I'm sorry but that isn't Chuck Norris
---
not many? how many is many enough?! it's also about warlock's pets.
---
it's a bug that is making game play annoying. just like leeway.

that was just an example.

there's a shitload of game play bugs.

they gonna do exactly the same thing they did with BFA. erase the beta forums and roll with it.

I am clearly not as smart as you are. May you please provide an explanation longer than 1 line? For the not as smart people, like me. Thank you.

Haha, ishnu alo farah brother. Tauren Druid here as well (also had a warrior and deathknight). 
---
We shall never forget what the Centaur did to us, but just as the Earth Mother heals all through time, so must we allow her to heal the wounds of our hearts. Forgiveness is the Tauren way my brother.
---
And cdew
---
Beta seems okey for me :)
---
I want to play a resto shaman because I don't mind healing, and also I'd like to get into raids a lot. But I'm a bit worried about world PVP and getting clapped while I'm out farming items.
---
I'm stream it, right now if fact. Twitch.tv/Codyyy13
---
art assets were in the client I believe from pretty early on.
---
Bloodseeker Bats were just as good, if not better, once ZG came out. Same 1.0 attack speed, and had screech to fuck with melee as well.
---
RIP.
---
Hmmm, guess my memory is failing me then.  Thanks for pointing that out.
---
I think it's necklaces or similar, tried on a pserver recently and it took about 2 hours of only grinding those stupid trolls.
---
Step 1: Farm literally the exact same thing **everyone** says to farm in Phase 1. Surely there will be no problems there.

Yes, people Mythic raid for transmog, not because they enjoy downing extremely difficult bosses, but for transmog.

Gonna be central here soon, also looking to play horde. Going to multibox UD Priest/Mage to 60. Will be looking to raid and PvP once pre BiS is done. Can keep in touch on here and look forward to a server release. I’m going semi-hardcore for PvE and PvP
---
I don't really remember that well the gear but pre-Sunwell the gear wasn't that great. Kara-level? Just above Kara maybe? And really, I do agree with the idea. Could also really help you if certain items just refused to drop form the raids. But you couldn't just go up the tiers pretty much pre-sunwell IIRC because of the attunements. And I don't know if the 2 mechanics kinda fed each other but it was ridiculous at one point because there really were those middle-tier "feeding guilds" that people got their attunements with, then jumped ship to higher tier guild, failed recruitment or got kicked out for whatever reason and then of course weren't accepted back to middle-tier guilds. So unless you were fast and very established progress guild you could be stuck in that middle-tier for a long time and recruit-starved and progressing was hard..
---
But that part I do remember, and all the drama it caused.
---
After sunwell it was a different story, the badge gear got insane boost and attunements were removed. and it worked better as a catch up. I guess the point is that I liked the idea. The execution kinda sucked, maybe because of the system, maybe because of other mechanics in place.
---
I don't have my Echeyakee anymore but I still have my Humar (black lion) I got in vanilla, and use him on my 120 hunter.
---
I absolutely want Class Quests available in Phase 1. I was just correcting the statement about none of the items being in BiS lists. For instance, if they aren't available until its intended, the items would only be usable for a very short time between ZG and AQ. I like having my diamond flask for MC. :P
---
I'm not sure what retail is but in tbc, wotlk and cata when I mostly played, the trinket you have for pvp that's a 2 min cool down and frees you from any stun fear etc. 
---
That was the human racial for the longest time, which means humans had a free trinket space for whatever they wanted.
---
It's actually crazy how brain dead you are. Witchblade/mastersmith not in game until later/updated in later patches. Focal sword is a sword and a druid cant use swords. Most of the others you linked won't be in game untill later phases as well and they are 2h which makes it so you can't use an off hand like skull or medicine pouch. Druid's don't have to pay someone to farm this item as they can solo princess themselves. Go back to retail bfa baby. I ain't replying to your dumb ass anymore
---
I don't get why people feel the need to just throw out what,where, and how they farm. I guess they are okay with increasing the competition and reducing the overall amount of gold they themselves make.
---
Lol, keep telling yourself that.
---
that str agil AP would translate to at least a hit around those levels i'd reckon. It's really all down to playstyle imo
---
They've already posted that numbers are accurate with screenshots of comparisons between beta and reference.
---
You will get them cheeks clapped from raid gear people
---
Did this too and it’s so painful. Everything my level can kill me before I kill it if I can’t kite it.
---
1: How was it extremely easier exactly?  Vanilla pvp was literally just about time investment, that’s it, no skill required.  To get arena gear you at least had to be skilled in some form.  Also it did not make pve gear irrelevant at ALL.  Pve gear had WAY more damage and your bis was generally a mix between pve and pvp.  And resil was the best thing IMO you mean pvpers had better options for gear in their own field of play?  I mean... that only makes sense imo. 
---
It would seem silly if pvpers got amazing pve gear and would be out dpsing people in raids even though they haven’t stepped foot in them wouldn’t it?  
---
2: maybe for you but world pvp was very abundant on my server.  The nagrand event was hoppin.  The summoning stones outside of raids was hoppin.  The daily zones were REALLY hoppin.  For me world pvp was crazy good in tbc.
---
3: People still sat in IF and org and other cities.  People traveled all over Azeroth to go to cot, Kara, ZA, isle of quel, Christ people still went to gurubashi arena around the clock on my server.  It was very very very very far from abandoned.
---
 4: I mean I understand if you didn’t like it I guess, I personally thought it was cool.  I hated shat as a whole but I didn’t mind that aspect.
---
5: fair enough.  I loved nagrand, netherstorm, hellfire, and shadowmoon myself.  The others were meh.  Bladesedge was awful imo.  
---
I mean I understand if you didn’t like it for subjective reasons but a lot of these are objectively incorrect.
---
Yes but when it's not rewarding it's a hell of a lot less fun. Sure I like killing hard bosses but when I see some tiny brain mongo who got mythic level gear from a +6 key because they are lucky or wearing a title that took me 250 pulls to get a few months ago it's really demotivating. Even pvpers get exclusive rewards with glad mounts and elite sets, and pvp is a minigame
---
&gt;to you
---
Everyone understood this. Youre the only one that read it as objective fact.
---
If you're like me and lazy The Rake's 1.2 isn't far from it nor is the 1.3 from the Moonstalkers.
---
Amazing. Simply put.
---
Where would one find this list??
---
Keep your 3.3 DPS and 16.6 MP5 you dumb fuck.
---
EDIT: Also Witchblade was patch 1.3, so it'll be in the game 2 months after launch.
---
Well it wasn't about doing damage it was about attacking every second to stop casters in PvP
---
Where would one find this list?
---
Love Sunken Temple
---
Mine's easy: I dont get to choose. Friends and I are having a vote in group chat. I dont really care, but I'm voting Alliance all the same.
---
Ah gotcha thanks for info I’ll look into that
---
My first character was a Tauren hunter too :-)
---
I had a moment of Déjà vu attempting to do the quest Defeat Nek'rosh in the Wetlands on the beta where I thought I could pull him with just one other melee mob but ended up getting the warlock + his pet, + Nek'rosh + the melee, so that feels fairly accurate. 
---
There are camps dense enough that pulling single mobs is difficult, tough positions with casters that need ranged interrupts or you'll body pull 4-5 Murlocs. Whether these places are more difficult on private servers I can't really say, but they feel correct to their behaviour in Vanilla.
---
What is Deviants for?? (sorry newbie here)
---
I've never played Vanilla WoW and I'm hyped to play it in August, do you know if its public knowledge which servers to avoid yet or is it too early to tell?
---
Best in slot items and being a good player... I don't know what to make of it.
---
I know it looks to me that the damage is lower from mobs and that crushing blows and critical hits are just not the same like it was during Vanilla vs the beta of Classic when you see these Twitch streamers fighting mobs 7+ levels higher than they are.
---
I have no numbers or proof... just going by what I remember playing all through Vanilla and into TBC.
---
WoD wasn't fine though. There was a massive bug/bottleneck or whatever you want to call it when you got to the step of creating your garrison.
---
Good on you guys. I got my sweet revenge ganking in Redridge, sneaking my way through SVT, Westfall and Elwynn. Just getting some lucky backstabs from stealth made me hyped.
---
This one Dwarf Hunter and Human Mage wreck me after I kill an AFK NE Warrior, and then later I come out of nowhere to kill the Dwarf Hunter suspecting nothing. My most satisfying moment so far, because that Dwarf obviously used /spit on my body after I first died.
---
Oh no no no
---
Desolace is beautiful
---
murlocs in general, the troggs &amp; kobolds in loch modan, are two low-level areas that come to mind that definitely should chain-pull.
---
not on beta so cannot comment on reports that blizzard nerfed aggro radius.
---
TipsOut just did a feral druid deep dive with a guy named Skarm who has experience on at least warrior, paladin, and druid.  Traditionally druids are resto for raiding and WSG gods, but Skarm says Druids can tank almost anything and might be even better raid tanks in pre-raid BiS (IIRC, hopefully I'm not putting words in his mouth) in terms of TPS (have to farm Manual Crowd Pummelers, but still).
---
/r/murderedbywords
---
Talent system is vastly more complex. Holy shit that is the dumbest thing i heard about vanilla talents xD more complex if u dont use your only 1 cookie cutter build found on the internet
---
This is useful to no one. We already have confirmation the numbers are correct.
---
Turns you into a ninja or a pirate. Yes really - makes it a nice easy money maker.
---
Jesus christ quit yer knighting for someone who 99% probably doesn't give two fucks if someone does the same challenge as them.
---
Even in his video he mentions if someone else does it they are insane, moreso than himself tongue in cheek like. 
---
Plus people have definitely had this idea, and the route is pretty standard as an alliance as there isn't much else to farm at certain levels my dude, get over it.
---
I gotta reply again, you're too easy. Revealing yourself to be a dumb fuck once again. Witchblade is trash until the item gets updated in 1.10. You are seriously embarrassing yourself. The fact that you are calculating its dps and mp5 says a lot too. This item is strictly for PVP where that shit is irrelevant. bye bye bfa baby
---
Why does anyone still use WarcraftMovies? They're a total scam site.
---
In PvP, the impression I've gotten is that Shaman are meant to bring the boom as Elemental (especially with fresh 60 gear because the base damage of Chain Lightning is so high compared to health pools).
---
Pristine raptor horn.
---
What guide will you be using this time?
---
&gt; Yikes
---
The item will be available in the second phase WITH it's final stats. Every item in the game will have it's final stats. You're a moron.
---
Pizza, vape, and coffee.  Git gud.
---
&gt;this is actually a serious post
---
I am 100% serious when I say to you now that you have made the most f-ed up moronic stupid post I have ever seen in my life and I have seen some weird and crazy stuff.
---
But what the hell. Let's do some straw manning.
---
How many people have died or got hurt in front of a computer playing video games compared to, lets say, driving their car. Riding their bike. Walking. Eating food or picking flowers in their garden.
---
Do you even know about any person in the history of mankind that have died from staying awake for to long by choice?
---
And you want to infringe on peoples freedom to make their own adult choices based on what exactly?
---
Are you starting to see how f-ed up silly your moronic concerns are?
---
Who cares if a shitter got extremely lucky in a low key or is using an outdated title. None of those people are actually playing the game.
---
Since most of the in-game api is the same it'll likely be easily exportable with GetQuestsCompleted() and the wowhead client like they did before the web API was made to be not potato.
---
Y’all are doing the lords work.
---
Your efficiency will suck no doubt, there just isn't enough shit to kill as a group of 5 and you will be stuck waiting for item respawns forever. Just keep tabs on each other and group up to smash some dungeons every few levels.  
---
There's basically 0 chance 5 people will all be playing at the same time every night so the idea that you can all group together to 60 is kinda silly anyway.
---
I was actually making a reference to game of thrones.
---
Only for those boring enough to mog full tier sets and not actually make their own unique look from the plethora of available equipment.
---
very cool. Not so into “Rockard” though. 
---
I think I get what you were going for but It’s not Stone-ard it’s Stonard.
---
I’m gonna be honest, if you wanna level as a 5 man then just do it. Wow is about having fun with your buddies. 
---
However, after 2 people the efficiency drops significantly with each extra person. Drop quests will take significantly longer, etc.
---
1. Better Class/spec balance
---
2. Heroic Dungeons
---
3. A TON of raids with huge WC3 lore, TBC was the richest expansion in terms of raiding.
---

Cooked Deviant Fish (savory deviant delight?).  It just changes your appearance.  Its really cool though.
---
Yeah...that wasn't one of the last two launches...
---

---
FTFY
---
Yeah I was going to include in my post that I'm sure a few people won't stick with it all the way to 60, so eventually it will be a non-issue. Not to mention people just being busy some nights when the rest want to level. More realistically there will be 3-4 of us on often tbh. Edited my post to reflect it.
---
I have no respect for cretins on the internet running their mouth distastefully about a problem they clearly dont understand, in a place it's certainly not tactful yet I'm still forced to read their garbage.
---
EXACTLY! so early on (first 6 months+) the dagger is gonna be a great choice for druids. go to bed bfa baby
---
It would be great esp for those big intertwined quests that lead to epic xp and good gear. There are a lot of good hidden quests or items that start a quest. I mostly look up all the zone quests and dungeon quests manually and even if there is an addon I’d prolly still do it manually since I like to put effort into it. But I get the desire for such addons. They’ll eventually get in later on but not on release.
---
?
---
Im glad someone copyrighted this otherwise someone might steal it.
---
I remember doing them before ZG on my rogue and warlock (been 15 years though, could be wrong). I don't see why they shouldn't be in the game from the beginning, though.
---
Having played a hunter in vanilla; Rag, Nefarian Ony and ZG, proud owner of Rhok and Lhok, dabbled in PvP, maybe up to rank 7 or 8...I think as long as you learn to play the class you’ll find a lot of versatility in the hunter and a lot of independence as well for solo/farming.  Biggest reason hunters have a bad wrap is that 1) there are/were a shitload of them and 2) there was definitely a larger proportion of them that weren’t very good at their class as compared to other classes. Learn the class and I think you’ll find the Hunter an enjoyable and intriguing play
---
He was smirking the entire time, he said 'Scrype reviewed best private guilds and is confident we can get the win' I mean what the fuck does that mean what private server guilds lmfaooo how can you review that? Also he mentioned later on Scrype started playing Wow in WOTLK.
---
People spend gold just to change their appearance with no other effects? :O how much does it worth?
---
People spend gold just to change their appearance with no other effects?
---
same as before just not pdf format joana has been tweaking his guide which might be a problem because I imagine everyone is going to use it now which means congestion.
---
Because it undermines the rewards for effort. Why would I want to bother raiding 8 hours a day for the first week on mythic when I could just get lucky in +5s and get the same loot? Why bother killing Jaina when I could go back in 12 months and get the mount without rattling my lone brain cell? Imagine if I could farm level 70 shit and get the gladiators netherwing, that shit wouldn't mean anything anymore, or if I could go back and one shot every boss in naxx and get the immortal title without lifting a finger.
---
Yep!
---
Second phase is 2 months...
---
Do you live to be offended?
---
What are you even doing with stamina while leveling it's the 4th priority stat.
---
If you're into the story playing through warcraft 3 and TFT would be a good preparation.
---
What are you talking about, rested bonus exp has been in the game since the original beta.
---
It is like vanilla but fixed in many many ways. You got the feeling of good Old oldschool and you don't feel anxiety when it is time for raid prep or some k9nd of end game dungeon 10m mode.
---
wow you know the phase release dates? no one else does but somehow you do..lmfao
---
Do what will make you have more fun. If that's solo leveling or 5 man just do what makes you happy.
---
The biggest part is what you enjoy in a game, but from an efficiency point of view it's not usually that good. [The xp split](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Formulas:Mob_XP#Group_Experience) itself wouldn't be that bad on its own, but you'll run out of mobs. Quests would take ages, but even grinding you'll suffer from having to move from spot to spot.
---
People hate on the xp split, but each mob is producing the same or more xp. In theory killing 5x as fast would mean group leveling was faster... if the bottlenecks didn't exist
---
How much does it worth per? :O
---
Yes, but you shouldnt put so much effort into trying to tame something for longer than 2 hours if the rake which looks cooler than brokentooth (appearance wise) is also available
---
fucking amazing I love ooga gang
---
I'd give you gold if I had it. I agree 100%.
---
I guess agree to disagree. See you in Warsong.
---
factions do, but BG queues don't.  Alliance usually get instant pop BG queues and horde have hour+ wait times at certain times of day.  PVP fanatics usually swarm to play horde and end up having to compete with each other for limited BG slots.
---
Oh alright thanks so at 60 enhance is pvp only?
---
Best part of beta streams tbh.
---
Average time to level 60 is only 10 days? holy shit that's fucking fast, most people I know are not average then, even in pservers it's more normal to see a fresh 60 with 20 - 32 days /played lol
---
Thanks for the answer! What classes were your biggest PvP enemies and hard for you to fight against? Is it rogues and warriors because they can be in the dead zone? if so, how do you deal with it?
---
Something not mentioned anywhere here is that this could be related to animation blending. IIRC since they're using the retail engine, the animation subsystem is likely the same from retail, and I'd be surprised if it's unchanged from vanilla.
---
I recall in classic you'd get kinda jerky/flickery animations on characters when you use an ability during a melee swing animation - it would cancel the melee animation (not the swing or damage) and play the ability animation (or sometimes not even play the ability animation or the swing animation).
---
I see that in some of these videos, that the animations are not cancelled; i.e. they're preserved, so regardless that your swing animation is playing when the enemy is far away, it's entirely possible the swing registered quite a bit before that due to the animations being blended (to enable smoother transitions between animations instead of choppy transitions or animation skipping).
---
EDIT: to clarify even further, in the vanilla clip above you can see that whenever crusader or poisons proc on a melee swing the rogue points his finger as if he's casting a spell - similarly when he uses gouge his hands glow purple but don't play the gouge animation for the movement of the hands/weapons, so you get the particle effect without the character model moving as expected.
---
In the TBC clips you see that they've fixed the poison-casting-animation for rogues. So at the very least they've changed when they play some animations for some spells.
---
Also if you recall this happens very often with parry/dodge animations - since you often dodge at the same time as swing, they blend in somewhat strange ways.
---
I can run two instances of Modern on one btag so I'd guess that article is wrong. do see why Modern &amp; Classic would be any different
---
Oh, it will be back.
---
That habit never left
---
The absolutely most expected comment that isn't creative in anyway it's just copypasta an extremely well known quote from the exact TV show and episode the OP references.  So incredible.
---
First time reddit?
---
Haven’t seen anyone say it in years tbh
---
One can only hope
---
It will be less efficient. However, play how you want to.
---
Some cons to this method is getting 5 people on every night at the same time and to have them stay commited to staying your level/doing quests with the other 4 is a feat all on its own. I did this with a family member and by about level 30 we just played slightly while the other slept and gradually threw the quest order out of whack lol.
---
It can also be incredibly boring to do the same quests x5 over. Pick up quests or collect quests come to mind. 
---
The plus side is you can do dungeons anytime you feel like it. Dungeons always picked me up if I was bored of questing and im sure the warriors will enjoy the loot as it will make their life much easier. 
---
If you are committed, have fun and don't mind leveling slower then go for it. I wouldn't call it harmful but it is definitely going to be much harder than if you solo or duo leveled. But if you have fun leveling as 5 then go for it.
---
Blood clots are the real killer, not so much fatigue. 
---
Hybrid sit/standing desks ftw.
---
I’ll deffo be doing this!
---
GRATS!!
---
Yes I know that. But two good launches after several lousy ones doesn't mean they've figured it out forever.

I dont think its bliz responsibility to do this, just as it is not beer companies responsibility to police how much people drink. 
---
However, i dont agree with all the others in this thread that are shitting on you for expressing a genuine care for your wow colleagues wellbeing.
---
First day won't make a difference. First week maybe. I wouldn't bother for 1 day. You will most likely get frustrated.
---
So are you just praying for weapon drops? Are you getting a new weapon often enough to keep the grind... well reasonable is just the wrong word, but tolerable?
---
You're a legend. Keep it up.
---
the fact that you think this confirms anything is hysterical
---
It's been a joy spanking you left right and center in this thread. I am done now..go back to bfa btw

On the same account? Or the same btag, because those are different things.
---
After Naxxramas on mains, it's time to gear up alts. \^\^
---
If you think I’m actually mad I’m pretty sure you’re a little autistic which would explain the post.
---
It took me 15 days of playtime to hit 60 in vanilla.  I wasnt running alts.
---
Quest item respawns in Vanilla/Classic are instant FYI. This is something Pservers got wrong or changed on purpose.
---
Dang, bad day at work? Wanna talk about it?
---
Love it so much. Only criticism is that it could have used a cliché big finishing part where y’all line up like some Charlie’s angels / spies / villains. I’m a big fan of this content, keep it up! You’ve motivated me to ignore stun resist and roll troll rogue
---
Nobody is restricting anyone from playing, just making sure people don't kill themselves trying to create YouTube or Twitch content. Cars have safety features/restrictions, so do bikes, we walk on a sidewalk and use rules of the road. 
---
Time will tell if you have read the "most f-ed up moronic stupid post" or had a quick glimpse into a not so distant future.
---
They're not
---
Yeah a level 30 drop off in playtime together is what I am predicting tbh. However, ideally I'm hoping we can rough it out.
---
natural selection.
---
stop pretending you know what's best for others and let them live their own lives.
---
If it dosnt GOD will commit Kittenocide
---
Always lefty
---
Yeah that was always weird. "No one knows about this place to farm sooo here ya go youtube"
---
That said I found a great spot to farm today on a pserver and really hoping the item drop rate/sell price is the same in Classic because I was able to make 15g an hour at level 36. So Thatll be my mount farming spot.
---
you'll want to KYS when you do quests like skullsplitter tusks
---
in pservers there is a lot of resources due to dynamic respawn, some quest exp are inflated, monsters either use all skills at the beginning or don't use at all, scripting is weird some times (naxx monsters could see through walls, much fun), as the bluepost from blizzard said, hitcap is 1% higher in classic ,the 14% parry and monsters in classic have a fuck load of skills, was watching a stream and a trogg soft enraged in the start of the fight lol
---
I suspect MC will be cleared in week one assuming servers are stable.
---
Classic should stay as is, they should open TBC realms for those who want to continue there.
---
5 man leveling is very fun and easy, but also very slow and inefficient. Quests where you need to collect items will take forever with the atrocious drop rate on Classic quest items. Just imagine farming out Sida’s bag for 5 people lmao. And like you said a 5 man group will fall apart very quickly because not everyone can play at the same time.
---
If it was midnight you'd get a decent amount of play time before the servers go to shit (EG WoD launched at 2am IIRC and didn't really go bad until evening when everyone was bombarding the servers). However legion, mop, and bfa weren't bad. So as long as blizzard doesn't have any technical issues to work out with layering or drastically underestimates the interest.
---
Can you give an example of any two classes that lost their uniqueness and became equal in tbc?
---
You have to remember, there was no transmog, and pretty much no toys, so people just looked like what they looked like.  Some people's gear looked pretty silly as well, so transformations were more valued than they might otherwise be in the current environment.
---
Thoughts on warrior and rogues? I've leveled and played 3 warriors to 60 on various fresh p servers but some reason I think I might enjoy rogue aswell. I've never played one, also note I will probably spend more time out of raid alone than in a group if that matters
---
We've discussed leveling routes and are trying to avoid leveling in STV to avoid a massive warzone. Your sentiment still stands though, since I'm sure there are loads of other drop quests elsewhere.
---
I take back the "mad" comment, you are correct I read too much into it. 
---
No I am not "a little autistic"
---
How are ye?!
---
I don't recall too many issues with MoP, Cata or Wrath launches but I could just be forgetting. I remember there were some problems during TBC launch. WoD was the worst in my experience.
---
Well, I think that title should go to Mythic+ Seat of the Triumvirate. It was freaking hell in most weeks with most affixes on high keys. Such an awesome dungeon imo, despite the difficulty.
---
Legion was awesome, it reignited my love for this game. I really miss it. I can't wait for Classic so I can fall in love with WoW again.
---
found the LS of WoW
---
lol scummy gummy
---
Find a guild who's rating schedule fits with your schedule, show up every week with full consumes, help buildings with stuff they need outside of raids, and you'll be considered a viable raid member regardless of whether Hunter DPS scales well.
---
Well, if you're raiding for 8 hours a day the first week you're probably in a top 10 US guild which is on you. Getting mythic level loot in low level keys is very, very rare. You're mount argument also makes little sense because in 12 months time, the Jaina mount will go to a 1% drop which means I'd much rather get it now.
---
I don't understand why you care if people go back and kill mythic raid bosses after they are nerfed into oblivion/solo it next expansion. You should care more about the fact that you got to experience the boss when it was relevant. Progressing on mythic Uunat has been the most fun I've had raiding in a long time. Mostly because its the first real boss they've put into the game in a long time. Do you think I'll care when shitters kill it when Blizzard glocks the boss later? No.
---
RUN PAST SH!!!
---
You'll see how I didn't say anything about anybody caring about BFA. It's just a fact that the raids are mechanically harder to a degree that they aren't even comparable though.
---
When Classic was first announced I went to go listen to his music again, cause while most of it was TBC and WotLK, I'll be damned if it wasn't nostalgic AF
---
It's a much better confirmation than your supposed 6+ months.
---
And I don't own BFA you dumb fuck.

Stick to my faithfuls. Elvui, weak auras, details. Then see if there's any QOL ones I find while looking around. Something like gathermate would be nice.
---
Dremlock made a few elemental videos in Vanilla and Vurtne was originally a shaman that released a PvP video on Google Videos IIRC.
---
Hello fellow fenris player! I was on the horde named Beond.  This sounds amazing :)
---
Nor are there many New retail players. I’d say 90% of the player base were selected because they opted in with accounts created 2004-2006.
---
Classic will have its share of modern GOGOGO players if not the pserver ones. Those two, unsurprisingly, are often linked...
---
Oh yeah? Where was this farming spot? Lol ;)
---
I'm alliance, and have been killed by them a few times, but their whole thing is so ridiculous that I love it.
---
I've been selling my leather and using that to fund weapons/armor upgrades but im pretty behind in my gear levels.
---
Yeah. There was no meta, nothing was working, and everyone was free to try weird shit.
---
"Guys, let's try x"
---
"I'm gonna try y"
---
Etc. It was amazing.
---
Thank you for understanding my point even if you don't agree with it.
---
I honestly believe it is in Blizz best interest to actually implement something like that to avoid the possible bad press.
---
The argument with the beer, bars and stores are liable if they sell to intoxicated or under aged person.... so to some degree Blizz might have a legal responsibility.
---
I’m doing this for all 59 dings
---
I kind of want to go herb/alch as a hunter for money making, in part because I'm likely never going to do the solo instance runs. Is it a pretty decent money maker or should I just go mining/engineering and make money some other way?
---
Day 1 of classic it will be better to level as a group. You want as many people to tag as many mobs as possible. Solo you only have your self to tag 1 mob. 5 players = 5 mobs, more depending on classes of your group. The faster you can complete quests in the starting zone the faster you will get ahead of the pack. You may level slower because of split mob xp, but you are leveling faster because you are taking all the mobs away from every other group completing quests faster. You will also be able to easily go into dungeons with the quests since you don't have to spam in general chat hoping to fill a group.
---
So will it be easier to level as a group? IMO for week 1 it will be. You have to compete with dozens if not hundreds of players trying to tag the exact same mobs as you are. Also looking at your group makeup, you wont be leveling with the orc warrior till 10-12. Warrior leveling, especially in the begining, is extremely slow so the forsaken part will out pace the orc heavily. If the orc wants to level with you guys I would highly suggest convincing him/her to roll forsaken.
---
&gt; just making sure people don't kill themselves trying to create YouTube or Twitch content
---
Your an idiot.
---
No human is known to have ever died from staying awake by choice. Why the hell would it be a problem with Classic suddenly?
---
Playing video games is litterally safer than taking a shit on the toilet.
---
Again, you are either a master troll or the dumbest idiot I have ever seen.
---
You are basically like that south park show when they had to use seatbelts on the toilet.
---
This is a literal fact. Not sure why people are downvoting.
---
By statistic you just literally cannot communicate with a third of Lyteshope server at any time, unless they use machine translation. And by literally, I mean Chinese typed characters cannot be rendered by the US game client without addons. It’s like communicating cross-faction, within your own faction.
---
Some China players are great people. I’ve made temporary alliances. But the language barrier kills most cooperation.
---
Oh, gotcha. That makes more sense.
---
It will get traction eventually. I read it and upvote everyone there. It’s just along way out as of now.your. Idea is interesting for sure, I like a lot of it.
---
This great spot on the right side of Azeroth. In a zone. A nice zone. With ground
---
&gt;I am not a doctor but 5 days of not sleeping can be deadly. 
---
There's no evidence of this. People have gone 200-400+ hours without sleeping with no measurable adverse effects on their health.
---
With extreme sleep deprivation, the human brain actually has the ability to "shut down" specific parts of the brain to rest them while staying awake.
---
Grats!
---
Whoops!!! Sorry!!! That’s the one hahaha
---
Horde is objectively better, so they are the "easy mode" imo. If you brave, play Ally.
---
Wouldn't really describe him as chill.
---
Damn my dude, thanks the next guide will be dedicated  to you!
---
The comments may say something like that, but the direct interview quote says No. Again, who knows by the time it's live, but as of that interview, the Blizz dev being talked to clearly says no.
---
&gt; Question: Many players are planning to play both Classic and Retail, like me. We were wondering if we are going to be able to run both games at the same time. For example, I'm growing flowers or whatever in retail and my Classic character is flying somewhere. Is it going to be possible to do that?
---
&gt;Omar González: No, when you log in you select a World of Warcraft account, that allows you one version at a time. It is similar to if you try to enter a kingdom, and then try to enter with another "copy" of the game to another kingdom, the game will throw you out. The operation will be similar. If you are playing Battle for Azeroth and you try to also enter Classic, the game will knock you out. The same rules apply.
---
The takeaway is that last sentence
---
&gt;If you are playing Battle for Azeroth and you try to also enter Classic, the game will knock you out. The same rules apply.
---
Which I'm assuming means if you log into Retail with your WoW1 account, and try to connect to Classic on your WoW1 account as well, it will not work.
---
I also assume if you have an active WoW2 account, you could use that for Retail, and WoW1 for classic, or the opposite. Just not 2 active instances of WoW1.
---
Man, my current job assignment lasts until late August, on one hand if it isn't extended I'll be out of work right when classic launches, on the other hand if it does extend I'll have a job.  Almost want it not to extend to play (def not quitting wanna keep the connection).
---
Like mad. Some need the change in animation I'm guessing, others just find it dope. No telling precisely how much its gonna be worth in classic, but it'll be a decent option for gold farming for your lvl 40 mount.
---
Thats fine just give me credit!
---
Keanu was one of the biggest actors/stars in the world when Classic Wow came out.
---
A night elf hunter ?
---
It happens in beta so, yes? Of course our 500 person guild doesn’t have anyone under the age of 30 except one 28 year old so it’s a bunch of old farts. The community is fantastic. However, I can only imagine a sharp decline in community once the street youths join.
---
For sure, I got you.
---
Has anyone checked out Ironforge on Retail? Fucking yikes. So sad. Way too many servers. I hope they keep the realm list short on classic.
---
lol get triggered
---
For real. Anything with some streamer with a goofy expression I just downvote and move on. Actually opened this because it was posted yesterday. Pure spam.
---
It's about the communal struggle
---
On the other hand, wouldnt having a really fast movement pet thats faster than epic mount be more beneficial for pvp?
---
And yet I've never heard of them because I don't follow any of that.
---
I’m triggered by a guy getting triggered
---
Bring on triggerception
---
is that why current raids are released and are beaten in 4 days when raids from Vanilla, BC, WotLK took months?
---
240 hours /played is a very casual 10 days to 60.
---
Speedlevelers will be 60 in 4 days and change.
---
I personally have lvld a mage with AoE grinding in 5.5 days and a rogue (slow levelers) in 7.5 days. Both of fresh servers so no outside gold or gear injection.
---
Just stop with this. Damage isn't off. Blizzard has an actual reference  client. People need to stop trying to "prove" they are somehow wrong.
---
Thanks for the concise response. Guess I'm going to have to make time for raiding !
---
Wow I had no idea. Very interesting, thanks!
---
Good luck getting to naxx before TBC as you need flying to enter the zone.
---
Don't let the Blacklist Brigade see this!! 
---
Loose lips sink ships!
---
It left the day that leveling became meaningless.
---
Yep.

To clarify, this addon isn't contained inside the add-ons folder. It seems the waypoints are on a map texture replacement, rather then a coord pin

I'm looking to play a Shadow priest. I'm wondering what professions I should roll for strictly money making. I want to flip items in the AH as much as possible, and use my professions as much as possible to just strictly make money and get rich. Abusing the economy is one of my favorite aspects of MMO's and I genuinely just want to get as rich as possible for pure fun.
---
I remember doing some dungeons with a shaman tank within the guild because we didn't have anyone else, but I never did it with pugs because shaman tank is not optimal. 
---
In the really low level dungeons it doesn't matter at all, you can have a pet tank them or even just run a healer and 4 dps and it will be fine if everyone doesn't suck.
---
Are trying to disrespect Keanu? That man is all Horde!!
---
They were aware of, had read, and incorporated GoT's references into the game.
---
Wtf i live like right near there
---
I can vouch for figureprint. Have 3 of them from my various characters at different times in wow’s history. I really love all 3 they’ve done a phenomenal job and I highly recommend. They’re not overly expensive, but for something like this, the price will be well worth it
---
I’m trying to decide between playing Warlock and Mage. 
---
My plan is to raid current content for the sole purpose of being a god in wpvp however I’d like to be able to do good raid and dungeon dps when the time comes.  
---
A spec that works well in pvp and pve is a plus to save gold. 
---
I’m worried about mage because I’ve heard they don’t scale well dps wise into t2 and beyond. 
---
I’m worried about warlocks because of their gear reliance and ability to get into bg premades. 
---
So with that in mind what would you recommend reddit?
---
Darkmoon faire is phase 3, so the neck would indeed be BIS.
---
So no human ever died from staying awake while playing a video game for a prolonged period of time??? Google says otherwise. Keep in mind this is documented and direct cause.
---
Yes, I feel like an idiot for thinking Classic WOW community any different from the currently hyper toxic BFA folks. I only hope this is the loud few and not the majority.
---
Do you really think that is what an alcoholic wants? They get up every morning thinking they are just gonna fuck up thier life and hurt as many people as they can on the way? They want to drown themselves in alcohol, lose jobs and beg for money?  They want to be sick all the time and cant wait to go through withdrawls?
---
When you are leveling it really doesn't matter. After you hit 60 you should figure out a good spec for whatever you primarily want to do.
---
Man you're sensitive.
---
I respect you... but... horde scum.
---
You also gotta remember, honorable and dishonorable kills aren’t coming till phase 2 and BGs are not coming till phase 3. You should have time to at least gather some MC and ony gear
---
Weather reporting at it’s finest
---
Ohhhhh shoot
---
Maybe I'll make my second account my Classic account so I can do that
---
I have barely seen any footage of Method Josh, but from the very little I’ve seen, I fucking despise this kid. Absolutely fuckin irks me the wrong way. Why do people watch this POS?
---
Pretty sure it's just their sales office.
---
In theory, I possibly could have done it on a server that was Blizzlike with a hybrid spec that allowed me to AoE, quest, and PvP. :P
---
Take Imp. Blizzard and Shatter but don't use Frostbite.

Gummy you’re a scumbag #Felmyst #NeverForget

This. The Matrix Trilogy wrapped up only one year prior to vanilla release.
---
Keanu Reeves wholesome jokes!
---
It's all about that Ornery Plainstrider 1.3 attack speed.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Gardner_(record_holder)
---
So 265 hrs is kind of the record ....  not sure where 200-400 hrs without sleep is coming from.
---
&gt;will I be getting smashed by people in raid gear ala MoP?
---
You might be misremembering MOP, PvP gear due to having scaling from both PvP power and resilience was very strong, to the point where going into battlegrounds as a freshly dinged player was a catastrophe. That wasn't raid gear you were getting mashed by, it was PvP gear. It was the reason they scrapped that system.
---
Vanilla has a similar problem, but on the completely opposite end, gear is gear and prior to the introduction of resilience stamina does not scale your health as quickly as damage. There is no "Good PvP gear, that is bad in PvE" that is given to you quickly to try compress that range, and the raid-quality PvP gear is offered on a very steep curve based on your honor gained compared to everyone else of your faction on the realm .
---
There's some notable exceptions but you're very likely to be crushed by well geared players. You will be sweeping strikes fodder to a well equipped warrior, globaled by trinketing casters and deleted by crit cold blood ambushing rogues. The rewards are there (though they scale off a little bit compared to naxx gear) but they require a lot of dedication.
---
Move along, people. OP is just a troll. Or possibly an orc?
---
Takk the Leaper! That was my introduction to taming rare pets, so addicting.
---
I think KTH is going to be the go-to threat meter
---
That’s uber cool
---
Get out of here with your capitalist logic.
---
So how many layers will people be on? 1000 ppl on horde ÷ 2?
---
So 500 instead of 1000 in the same zone? Yah should make a big difference like sticking your hand in 5 liters of boiling water compared to 10 liters
---
Yup, a well played tankadin or feral druid tank were really valuable for their niche abilities. We kept at least one tank of every spec active all the way to and through Sunwell back in the day, and they all did great. Tankadins that are capable and willing to respec are really great too, being able to swap someone to Holy on short notice can be really valuable.
---
I showed the guy who will be playing an Orc the run to Tirisfal via the zep so that he can level with us.
---
Show me that documented and direct cause. And dont link to some fake news article.
---
Its not op, someone linked that image in a forum about bad tattoos dated 2004
---
Tauren or Night Elf Druid?
---
&gt; First off, this is an over-exaggeration. AQ40/Naxx gear easily takes you to 68-70 without finding any upgrades.
---
Any? That's just wrong. There are some really good rewards from the elite quests. Or the Nagrand combat arena chain. Besides endgame to me would also include BWL/MC. How many players even cleared naxx in retail vanilla?
---
&gt;Secondly, if your argument is that the content is still useful as it remains as stepping stones to later content then all that really becomes useless is the raids. All 1-58 zones, quests, gear and dungeons would still be as useful, as it would be stepping stones up to TBC in the same exact way.
---
No idea what you're trying to say here with that wording, but if you're implying that making Vanilla content last to early TBC raid/dungeons would trivialize TBC content I just don't see how? The whole thing about making endgame content closer to early TBC content would also mean that vanilla content would still be challenging as a fresh level 70, which would mean it wasn't trivial.
---
I think content expansions provide should be closer to just adding a bunch of new tiers in the content span, with certain old raids still offering the occasional really good pieces for certain classes. This would keep everything more relevant and not just ignoring all the old content once you hit max level.
---
&gt;As for content becoming trivialized I would argue that with the full package of vanilla content in the game raids like MC, AQ20 and ZG are already pretty much "leveling raids" (like Gnomeregan or Scarlet Monastery are leveling dungeons) that you only do a small handful of times before moving on to more pressing content. If someone starts playing Classic in phase 5 it's not unlikely that they finish a full AQ set without ever getting more than 3-5 MC pieces (which they got in one or two gearing runs).
---
Missed my point, I wouldn't like to see MC/ZG/AQ20 etc as leveling raids, but instead raids that you did once you hit 70 and had some blues that you could get into doing alongside the other early TBC content. BWL, AQ40 and Naxx would have pieces that are pre BiS for early TBC raids. Basically much closer matched to the new content making them still an integral part of the game.
---
LOK'TAR OGAR BROTHER
---
Undead rogue it is. With the long black hair.
---
Blood and Thunder, friend. Shit that’s sweet.
---
My server, or at least my faction, pretty much never bothered.  The raiding guilds were too far past them content-wise and the guilds trying to break into raiding struggled to put a party together.
---
Apparently I really missed out by never questing in Duskwood
---
Classic will have it's 5 minutes of Fame and surpass retail for a few months. Then the grind to 60 will set in, and amount of guilds clearing beyond BWL and ZG will dwindle. 
---
Around that time classic will settle into a routine population that does wPvP and endgame raid content. At which point all the casuals will return to retail play through the newest raids, as they wish for a less time demanding and more mechanically challenging version that releases new content ever so often. 
---
When it's all said and done, the players will bounce between new content on retail and replaying classic with different classes each time during the retail content drought.
---
If blizzard is truly smart, they will leave classic be as is, and it will suffice as the never changing constant for the majority population of Warcraft players to enjoy as an alt game to return to, one day finishing. 
---
Granted, classic will always have it's dedicated loyal player base that will be true, maining classic above all else with a geared class for every situation.  Though, I expect even that population to dwindle after two years.
---
Due to all this lack of continuity, i doubt Method will invest anything more than what it's high viewer classic twitch streamers will provide with their streamed endgame experiences.
---
It still exists, when someone boosts to max level in retail they just spam ding 119 times.
---
We should probably continue to speculate the best time for duos to shit to produce the most efficient leveling.
---
Lol
---
I think our boy Neo Johnny Wick Geo actually used to play WoW on the down low. He’s just all shhh about it.
---
Gardner was just "official" because he was monitored as part of an experiment. There's a bunch of reports of people going longer, for example Maureen Weston at 449 hours.
---
As far as Guinness goes, I don't think they take submissions for sleep deprivation because they don't want to encourage people to do it.
---
This comment will age well
---
&gt; Longer view distance: No, they went with something faithful
---
This is false. You could absolutely script out your view distance as far as you wanted in Vanilla, it would just tank your PC. Now it doesn't matter.
---
    /console farclip #
---
Where # is anything less than or equal to 4000. The maximum in Vanilla you could achieve without messing with the cvar was 777 and in Retail it's 1277.

I loved it, personally.
---
I'm typing this on the WoW: Cataclysm edition of the SteelSeries Shift right now. I've had it since it came out and and the only problem with it is the clips on the hand rest broke so it needs to be taped on now, lmao.

---
&gt;Yeah I was going to include in my post that I'm sure a few people won't stick with it all the way to 60, so eventually it will be a non-issue.
---
The problem isn't the later levels, it's the earlier levels. Leveling as a group of 5 from the get go is going to be a humongous fucking disaster, through and through.
---
It would be much better to level in groups of 2 or solo and just group up for dungeons.

GMs won’t be talking in world chat when people go “can I speak to a GM please?”
---
&gt; We've discussed leveling routes and are trying to avoid leveling in STV to avoid a massive warzone.
---
The primary benefit of leveling in a group would be that you **could** do areas that are highly contested, because you're a group of 5.
---
No one cares how you feel, but thank you for sharing your feelings on the internet.
---
Thank you so much for the info!! There’s a Joanasworld guide that’ I’m going to follow. It seems pretty good but I’ve also heard that just grinding out mobs is fast too. I’m going on a private server right now and trying to get a plan.

It's such in an-depth concept that it really deserves its own thread.
---
What's with the wow tattoos lol at least this one looks good , that other one looks fucked up
---
They will be trying to avoid each other. Why compete for open world bosses with another? 100% you will get pserver guilds and players. There are hundreds of guilds and thousands of players. And will stick around for the long term.
---
&gt; Oh yeah? Where was this farming spot? Lol ;)
---
Sure, it's at 36,40 go fuck yourself

:P
---
So me and my brother are going to level alts together and hes going to do a Druid. I will already have a Druid main so I was wondering what would be a good combo with a Druid? I want to level a Warlock and Mage at somepoint. Also been thinking of a Warrior.
---
Thoughts? Im really open to any class.
---
&lt;Yeah Let's Just Wipe&gt;

yes u can raid tank and dungeons without beeing a leader, just learn the fights

You should relog after each Bellygrub kill to make sure it's always rested

---
I feel like they should get celebs that actually play/played it this time. Like Vin Diesel or Ronda Rousey or Mila Kunis. I love Keanu but they can do better.
---
Several reasons.
---
1. Its literally the real life job of some of the people raiding, meaning they have significantly more time to play. It's more realistic to compare the number of wipes to see which was actually harder. 
---
2. Wiping is less punishing, in Vanilla most of the time was spent running back to your corpse after dying. If you died on C'thun it could very well be a 5-10 minute encounter with a 30-40 minute run back after wiping.
---
3. People were significantly worse back then than they are now. Go watch a world first video from older expansions and compare them to now and you'll see there are at time 10x as many things going on as older raids. I guarantee you most of the raids are going to be cleared within a couple of days of their release once Classic releases, with the exception of MC since it will be out day 1 and it will take people a while to get to 60 and gear up. That is exactly what happens on private servers.
---
Don't get me wrong, I don't play or like BFA currently and am extremely excited for Classic, but that's no excuse to be dense.
---
A real family man takes his two-week vacation to get to 60 at launch.
---
FUCK YEAH! Dont let peoples jokes bring you down. Im going to be a feral Tank (OT in raids). 
---
You go get that crossbow you beautiful bastard!
---
chuck norris vs bane
---
Not going to do the traditional night elf right-of-passage and run to Elwynn at level 1?
---
The Mithril Order trinket would be pretty useful depending on your class, I should think.
---
tfw you live near Dallas and had clue that was there. Neat!
---
It did not operate like that. Out of combat only.
---
Because nothing in any game since has felt as satisfying as being a warrior in TBC. I love vanilla warrior, I'm planning on maining it again, but if TBC was an option I'd level straight past 60 honestly. Other classes I would like to play in vanilla, but warrior in that xpac was sublime.
---
is dungeon soloing a reliable way of making money?
---
Depends on what you want and if you are interested in min/maxing for what you want.
---
NE has more mana and better dodge
---
Tauren has better stam and defense
---
NE has Shadowmeld which can come in handy even after level 20 but most of the time you can stealth in cat form
---
Tauren has Warstomp which is just amazing (Ive been enjoying it at least on a pserver).
---
But the real question is, would you rather look at a Tauren run the for hours upon days, or would you rather see a Night Elf run for hours upon days. 
---
Also do you care about Lore?

People always recommend Alchemy cause its always in demand. Im thinking about doing it on my shadow priest over engineering even though I love to PvP. Mana pots seem like they'll be nice for pvp. Otherwise tailoring and enchanting, tailoring and getting good recipes will let you upsell skirts and shit, and also enchanting doesn't have any auctioneering  deposit (atleast it was this way on private servers) so you can abuse that

Their version of “Getting ready for Launch” is probably gathering a large amount of cursed wow related images and memes to spam some discord servers/ reddit with. It’s never too early to start stockpiling content.

You do much PvP on a prot paladin? I wanna make a prot paladin as an alt, I love aoe farming like that but I dont wanna play ret or resto and I mostly Pvp so I wanna know if theyre helpful at all
---
I think rogues are more fun then warriors in PvE. Pvp can be fun to gank people but in Bg's if you get targeted you can die real fast. Also warriors will make you sad as they kill you pretty fast so. Idk they both have ups and downs.

Mages are always useful and wanted for the catering(food/water) abilities and fast travel(portal). They also do great in both pvp and pve, you dont have to worry about soulshards which frees up bagspace which leads to more gold. Also mages are decent at farming especially if you are frost (which youll have to be for MC at least)
---
in almost all cases i’m gonna say rogue is better.
---
Warrior is great in pvp after you’re decked out in bis at 60.
---
Hi gonna say rogue is better.
---
warrior is great in pvp after you’re decked out in bis at 60., I'm dad.
---
This guy knows what's he's talking about. It's in one of the oldest maps.
---
I'm with you, dwarf warrior for sure.
---
But I guess I'm a masochist because I also want to level a paladin.
---
thank god
---
It's 8-11 days played unless you're a pro. So just keep that in mind. The wall hits around lvl 40. Some actually say 48 is only half way. Stay safe out there
---
Keanu Reeves logged In for the first time; it was called the cataclysm; death wing was just in the wrong place and got the blame for it; but then Keanu felt breathtaking and discovered pandaria for us.
---
I actually didn't like guild banks. Loner GMs would set up G-banks to have a mega bank. I don't like reagent banks either because I think players need to have some limited bag space and make decisions on what to get rid of and what to keep. Retail looked like it became World of Hoardcraft. Pun intended. But I don't care what Blizzard does there, it's not game-breaking and hoarders will run out of space regardless.

Skinning and Tailoring. 
---
Herbalism, Mining and Skinning will all be popular because everyone wants to make money. 
---
Go Skinning and vendor everything until Heavy Leather, Tailoring you can make your own gear AND you can sell bags which will be huge especially around level 20-30 when people have money but no big bags. 
---
Not saying its the most lucrative but if you get a jump on tailoring and start pumping out some silk bags early people will pay. Afterall silk 10 slots will last quite awhile so its worth the money sink for people. 
---
More slots == more gold. Good investment for everyone involved.
---
A second speculative bit of information came from /u/TheRealRecollector a few days ago: 
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bxvobi/april_2019_games_earning_bfa_is_really_in_a_very/
---
The third bit of data that seem to corroborate 750k-2million range of active users is character activity and raid kill numbers being lower than in the past.
---
&gt;4 days 20 hours 49 minutes.
---
/played my dude. Joana didn't do that in one sitting. Almost no one is going to be staying up 4 days straight, it becomes terribly inefficient as you start to get very drowsy. If you're not going for server first 60, all that matters is that you get to 60 when every other NEET does so you can start doing MC or high level dungeon farming pre-raid gear.
---
Anyone who is seriously going for a server first 60 is going to break ToS with account sharing. Anyone who isn't doing this is not going to get server first level 60. Don't worry about people not sleeping. Blizzard isn't your doctor, they aren't your baby sitter.
---
The game even tells you to take a break in its loading screen.
---
So what your saying is that Keanu actually made wow when he was plugged back into the matrix; damn man such a wholesome breathtaking guy.
---
If you played a Warrior 3 times I would go Rogue. Change it up a bit.
---
Pretty much everything about TBC was better than Vanilla.
---
More classes and specs were viable, though there were problems with that as BT and Sunwell were added.
---
Gear was better itemized.
---
Leveling was starting to be streamlined.
---
Lust/Hero are fun and an interesting way to plan encounters and dps (though severely OP for the entirety of TBC)
---
Crafting meant more, from the weapons that were amazing for pve and pvp, to the tailor sets that actually were better than a lot of raid gear for some classes. 
---
25 man raiding allowed for better tuning and better distribution of players.
---
Kara and ZA were fantastic.
---
Badge gear was a great way to catch up players and keep some raids and dungeons relevant.
---
Heroic dungeons were a great addition to keep dungeons relevant and challenging.
---
Isle of Quel Danas was fantastic new tech and a great community building event.
---
Esfand is only playing the classic beta though.
---
That’s badass
---
I stopped watching after the end of season 4 passed up the books. I'm guessing the show started to go downhill when they ran out of material that was actually written by GRRM and started making their own shit up.
---
&gt; Not some rando streamer on coke.
---
That is Josh, a Disc Priest in Method.  While I don't like his content, I put some credibility into what he says when it involves Method's plans.  He was the one who leaked the 100 Million gold debt strat that Method used to get a world first iirc.
---
I understood your argument as being that old raids doesn't become obsolete because they function as pre-raid bis. So AQ40 doesn't become obsolete because it's pre-bis to Naxx, BWL doesn't become obsolete because it's pre-bis to AQ40 and MC doesn't become obsolete because it's pre-bis to BWL etc etc.
---
I was saying, if that is the argument then ALL content leading to that point is not obsolete. Which would mean the fact that TBC launches does NOT make vanilla content obsolete, except for the content you would do at end-game.
---
And no, I'm not talking about MC etc becoming leveling raids, I'm saying that at phase 5-6 they have already been marginalized down to raids people don't pay much attention to anymore.
---
Ya I don't mind some of them but being able to communicate with everybody will be nice.
---
Josh is part of Method...
---
Ah, based on pictures, that is correct. There aren't any events posted anywhere, so it still must be something internal for the Dallas sales office. Maybe a recruiting event, though the season isn't right.
---
It better have goldshire inne some where in there or ima start a riot
---
Where do you think you are?
---
I'm absolutely set on healing and having a dps to play.    
---
 I considered druid as my healer, no other reason than fashion and turning into animals.  But gameplay wise I'm worried I'll be not enjoy being... wanted (?) As other healers.  I hear her gameplay is as simple as mages dps.  But I've never played classic so can't actually know if it's true. 
---
I am playing alliance, so that leaves me with pally and priest.   Ive never played a priest in wow.  Never made one.  Is she engaging and what is her difficulty level in raids?  Does she share loot with mage warlock?   Bc that sounds like a rough life to get geared.  
---
If I'm worried about competeing for gear should I be worried about going pally?   How big of an issue is gearing in raids as a popular class in classic?    Is pally gameplay fun?  Or is the buffing she has to do obnoxious?   
---
For dps I do not want to use my healing class at all, I do not enjoy respecing.   But I really want a ranged class.  I played legions bm Hunter and enjoyed the freedom of movement and his simple but effective gameplay.  Is anything like that in classic?   
---
If I played melee i honestly couldn't pick between rogue or warrior.  Which do you think would be better for someone who likes big dps?
---
So that is the reason less than 1% of the players even saw the raid?  
---
Damn those cheaters.
---
It was the god damn birds knocking you off the mount that drove me insane about those quests.  Dailies were just the best way to get gold because gold was still hard to come by.
---
Wouldnt he be a human just like chuck norris tho like that makes more sense to me
---
It's fairly good, but it is very much "for hunters". For example, the alliance version is just "kill murkdeep".  At level 15.
---
Murkdeep is a level 19 mob that spawns 2 level 17 murloc hunters, which are RANGED mobs, and he himself has a net that feels like it has about an 8-10 yard range, and he has a runspeed of around a murloc coastrunner. these mobs all spawn in together, and aggroed on you, and the corpse run is like 800 yards. 
---
You aren't doing that unless you are a hunter, IMHO. 
---
One thing I would recommend: time your grinding. Joana's guides are designed for you to literally kill everything on a straight line path between quest objectives, and to be honest, that's kind of what I like to do and have fun doing anyways, but you will often find your class, especially early, has very hard spikes in power that then tail off with level. 
---
Try to grind very heavily when you are strong, and be more quest oriented when you are weak, and if you are about to get weaker... try to grind until you ding, rather than hand in quest objectives and ding, thereby reducing the exp of all the mobs you would be grinding. 
---
For example, warrior starts weak, gets a big power spike at level 4 (With rend) that does not last, then gets really strong at level 5 (buys a weapon from the vendor), then tails off REALLY hard up to level 10, when you get your class quest weapon and rank II of rend and are strong again.
---
So obviously, try to not be grinding at level 9 if you can possibly help it. The best time to grind is levels 4-6, when you are strongest.
---
I kinda hope some unknown private server guild wipes the floor with them.

Great questions! I don't care about who I choose as far as aesthetics go. They're both bearable. (Baddum) 
---
I do want to heal and play Balance!
---
i concur.
---
The sniper missed: next time, bring your A game!
---
Like I already said, the server first on every server is going to be people account sharing. Anyone not doing this has exactly a 0% chance at being server first.
---
Know what mate? I was exactly the same.
---
But getting two games with one subscription is always a good thing. And for me, I didn't join until Wrath of the Lich King, so it's fascinating for me to see WoW before everything I know.
---
And it also gives Blizz a chance to stagger and alternate content for both games, making sure we have content to go at constantly.
---
Genuinely looking forward to it, now.
---
Uhhh where is this
---
jeez these streamer fanboys are very protective huh
---
they sent the wrong chuck, aka chuck E' cheese.
---
I was in a guild that cleared Naxx in vanilla, was it really that low?
---
Well two friends and me will lvl together heres how we do it.
---
We will meet together at westfall with circa. Lvl12
---
We will only play those chars while everyone is present.
---
If someone isnt there we will skip to our other char which is for lvling alone.
---
A few might say this is stupid because it takes much longer to hit 60 but you will have 2 chars.
---
Logically the solo char will be 60 first and will be played way more often but its always great to have two high lvls imo.
---
We obviously dont care about rushing 60
---
Yeah, but i was implying that it was a private server screenshot with that comment to be honest.
---
Can't say I will enjoy the auto-attack madness that is leveling as a holy pally is. But man did I enjoy healing as one with old mechanics.
---
I had so much time to play back then and even recently, but I'll be starting my first full time job in a few weeks so there goes the majority of my free time.
---
Oh i know definitely know that. However, my friends aren't huge fans of wpvp (but due to majority rule we will roll on a pvp server). Who knows though, maybe we will go to STV when the time comes. :)
---
I remember in BC having Lynx cat from Eversong forest on my 19 NE hunter twink. Got so many whispers asking about it.
---
Mate I have some bad news for you.. WoW, PUBG, HoTS, Siege, H1Z1 are all dead or dying games. Not much of a market anymore.
---
When did they fix this bug. I think it looks awesome and should bring it back for classic :p
---
Attunements in vanilla were not a really big deal. They went nuts with attunements in TBC and had to dial it way back.
---
Welcome to the party!
---
And by party I mean all of us sitting in a room and anxiously staring at the count-down clock.
---
I'll agree to disagree on LFG/LFR - if only because one of the main things driving me back to WoW is the social factor. I'm looking forward to have to communicate with people again. To cooperation being central to the gameplay even outside dungeons.
---
You're retarded
---
well I was pointing out that being defense capped wasn't a thing in classic wow
---
Holy is fuegooooo
---
I have also heard quests give quite a bit less experience in classic than on private servers and that overall, leveling times are slower.
---
Becoming legends and it’s only the beta. Can’t wait for what else is to come!
---
I ran into a 5  man low 30s leveling group in STV when I was helping a warrior with his WW axe quest when I was around 48.  They tried to gank me and almost got me.  Apparently they'd been mowing down horde left and right.  So I spent the next 10 minutes killing them via kiting slowly.  5 man groups are not easy to fuck with.
---
'Serenity Now' crashing the funeral was what prompted me to get into WoW
---
&gt;level 2 hunter
---

---

---
RIP
---
10% more parry 1% more dodge and same miss chance.
---
Hmm well Balance may be difficult regardless simply because of how it is in Vanilla. 
---
That said if you really dont care about lore, aesthetics or anything like that. Then do you care what racial? If it comes down to racials I would go Tauren for two reasons.
---
1. Warstomp. A free (not including CD)stun is good for any class. Especially a class that can heal themselves.
---
2. +15 to herb. Which is important because if you go Balance you really should go Alchemy eventually. Balance burns through mana so the mana potions will come in handy. Its cheaper to make them than it is to buy them.
---
I played NE Druid in Vanilla and although I used Shadowmeld from time to time. I can really only think of once instance where it was actually useful. Which is when I was oom and couldnt go cat. Other than that the only time I used Shadowmeld is when I was just to lazy to go to cat.
---
Going to play a Tauren this time around.
---
either the left or right.
---
i mean, since most everyone else is going to them, they must have better prices, right?
---
only people with gold to spare go to the middle, pay more for the convenience of a shorter line
---
Elite mobs drop way more money then everything else. For example the elite demons in winterspring drop 10-15s each and also got a pretty good loottable with higher chances to drop then normal mobs.
---
Satyrs in Azshara, which was a very common farming spot, for example only drop 1s each.
---
Aside from drop quests being disasters, wouldn't the efficiency of being able to kill 5x the mobs, along with us being able to tag more mobs faster be a benefit? Or do you think mob spawn rates will be too slow to accommodate?
---
I have thought about the split leveling concept and will definitely give it some more thought, and bring it up with my group.
---
Ahh damn sorry for your loss, I couldn't imagine losing one of my siblings. I also played a night elf hunter on fenris back in vanilla, her name looks familiar but I didn't know her. If you can find the strength, you should definitely make a tribute character.

Thanks a bunch. Might have to activate classic ony off account then if I want to do both. But to be honest I probably won't have enough down time while leveling to play retail at all
---
max virgin
---
&gt;is a human hunter
---
BRD pickpocketing can net you some. Also, desolace crocs drop some of the best vendor trash in the game at mid level ish.
---
To be honest I know people already taking PTO for a couple weeks. I usually do 12 hour shifts regularly so living a 12 on 12 off schedule isn’t all that bad. Leveling in vanilla is so enjoyable that those 12 hours a day will fly so fast. My only caveat is that after 2 straight weeks you’ll be so burnt out at the end and even then you’ll be in the top % of people at 60 so end content will be limited until the general population can catch up
---
literal god
---
This is what I was doing. I think the only downside (Never tried it) is that obviously you won't do as much damage and you can't spec the pet talent points into the optimal spec for both pvp and pve. But I think it would be good enough

This way better. What ya think?
---
I think your English is really good. I understood every word
---
Beat choice is rogue because if dual stealth imo. 
---
Warrior is great for you because you would have a healer. 
---
The other two are interchangeable imo, both would work well in their own way but are both great solo

---
this is way better imo. What ya think?
---
What are your thoughts on how this could impact phase 1? Thinking that Prince Nazjak spawns could be particularly problematic, as well as Devilsaur or Lotus.
---
Nah, it's pretty slow. Boring too, but yeah slow as well.
---
Chris Metzen always mentioned world domination.
---
I guess the Omni was his first step.
---
That would be at world record pace which is 4days 20h.
---
&gt;Oily is always needed for FAPs 
---
Made me double take
---
bought the strategy guide at the same time i bought WoW.
---
it has held an honored place in my bathroom reading material ever since, even though it was outdated before it was printed lol.
---
I recall a very distinct feeling of fear and caution when I was leveling back back in vanilla (BC too). There were areas where I would ask myself "do I really want to go there? Looks very dangerous".  That feeling never ever came back.
---
I look forward to playing classic to see if the game can ever make me feel like that again. That should determine whether it was really a game design thing, or just the result of me being inexperienced and naive back then.
---
Single drop quests are almost always shared drop. Sida''s bag as well. But I'm not 100 because I have never leveled in Wetlands because I hate it.
---
I see that, but I think the social factor was made a lot more toxic because if you got a bad rep, you could change server or name and poof. No consequences for being a dbag.
---
I think hes thinking about cata.
---
Is this a multi boxer? I realize it’s insanely unlikely that 3 accounts for 1 person would get beta, but the behavior of these three characters is pretty multi box ish.
---
Borderlands 3, Halo MCC, CoD:MW, Monster Hunter World: Iceborne and the new FF14 expansion are probably up there. It will be hard to tell until WoW hits what the subscriber numbers will actually be like though.
---
Elemental shaman hands down. Frost shock,I think it was, had a longer duration than the cd so, if they caught you they could literally just sit in your dead zone and frost shock you to death.  A good Frost mage could dead zone you fairly well though you could also nearly and sometimes actually 1shot mages with an aimed shot. and of course paladins cuz....well...paladins....
---
Warriors were intimidating but more bark than bite for a hunter who was able to kite. Spec for 41 yard range and they’re even easier. If they get close and hamstring you, pop your insignia-scatter shot, get to range, concussion shot, kite. if they get close again,deterrence i(f you’re hybrid survival spec), wing clip, disengage, get back to range. Similar with a rogue who managed to get a stun on you....throw flares whenever you can.

Hey! Glad you like the quest tracker. It's designed to be easily-portable to Classic, should an API exist. Currently it looks like we won't have an API for launch, but based on my May interview, it may be planned for a later phase.
---
If there's an API, we'll also look into making the mount collection tracker compatible with Classic.

I really hope Classic brings about a resurgence of these types of videos and machinima, so good.

There are like 200-400 active players and they don't all play at the same time. And all of them are doing things that are just for "content" and such. Like getting BiS for level 40 or trying to do high level dungeons. It seems like a giant oversight and not much of "testing" is going on.
---
That's awesome to hear! Fingers crossed, and keep up the great work!
---
Correction: Alliance aren’t queuing. I’ve been sitting in Q for 4-6 hours before a pop. And when it does it’s either a full alliance premade or just 10 (the minimum to start a game.
---
I would like a Rogue for Wpvp. Hmm Damn yeah Rogue may very well be what I take. Brother will be a LW on his main so could easily get gear for both. 
---
Thankyou!
---
Not when blizzard specifically asked to test AB. That’s why they are shutting realms down now. If you can only do one thing they will get the eyes they need on it.
---
Ah, so since you haven't heard of them they don't exist? 
---
Someone should tell Sco the bad news then.
---
Most WoW tattoos are awful cringe.  
---
This is minor, yet significant enough to not reach that level.  Well done. 
---
Cheers for not being a super edgelord and getting Illidan over your shoulder.
---
I dont think when it comes to killing they do alot, but you can take alot alot hits. So you wont be the flag runner but I can see a prot pally coming in handy in pvp. Maybe not alot of Wpvp but bgs.
---
I never played a pally so Im guessing.
---
They're so ugly I love it
---
Dreamhack was just in town. That’s what it’s from.
---
Source: I live here and a ton of streamers like Esfand came to my bar after
---
Surely with the multitude of video proof that's surfacing they'll do SOMETHING to deter this. Other games have solved the issue, they are capable as well.
---
Oh weird must of just been you. Everyone I know has the invite. Fuck even my Gma and shes been dead for 2 years.

This is *nothing* compared to the box on boats, you felt like a **king** up there leering over the groveling mountless masses.
---
Well pvp servers are more dangerous and no matter what class you choose there is a counter to it.l
---
That siad, if you are looking for pvp I would Mage or Rogue. Hunter is good but can be exploited in the deadzone which sucks for pvp.
---
Now Both Mages and Rogues will be popular so it comes down to your preference, do you want to cast spells or shank people?
---
Yea. People are about to remember the 3 dot special fear combo.
---
If you set the boar low enough
---
if anything they'll put arena event in phase 2 where it belongs
---
I do wonder how the meta is going to change with a much more experienced player base. From the data I’ve seen warlock looks a bit underrepresented at the moment so I’ll be curious to see the final results. I’m already terrified at the idea of running into a Orc warlock in world pvp and this isn’t helping.
---
I guess it isn’t to late to change what class I am going to play....again....for the 10th time. Sigh.
---
&gt; I just KNEW that Blizzard is not releasing Classic because they have big hearts and love the players...they did it because it was TIME to REDO all the mistakes that they did in the last 15 years with WoW, and in this process to prove, again, that they can revolutionize the MMO gaming in 2019 like they did in 2004.
---
I think you've been in this circlejerk a bit too long.
---
WoW is a fifteen year old game. With a *lot* of warts. The circlejerk in here is to shout that you love every single wart as if it was purest gold and that your life has no meaning except to survive long enough to play vanilla WoW eighteen hours a day, but if you think that its outdated graphics and gameplay are going to kill the retail juggernaut you are straight delusional.
---
This is like thinking that the gog.com rerelease of Baldur's Gate would kill the Dragon Age franchise, or Oregon Trail would kill Red Dead Redemption.
---
We've got it back, we'll enjoy it, but take it for what it is.
---
Np man! Hope you have fun.
---
What was your name?

2.5 months for a paladin, sounds about right. Could probably lessen that a little bit if I distinguish myself as a good player on the server.

I will make sure to start a Chuck Norris discussion every time I'm in the zone, my go-to fact will be "Jesus could walk on water, but Chuck Norris can swim through land."
---
As an altoholic you might want to stop all your PvP alts at level 49 to play in that bracket. Very easy to get BiS gear and will let you have a fun experience playing a lot of different classes no matter what crazy raid gear is available at max.
---
What about rare spawn mobs? Or Devilsaurs? Or lotus? I mean, anything in the world (sans raid bosses) can be abused in this way if you have someone on another layer.
---
As a restro anything that will happen except holy pallys because they just take to long and no one wants to fuck with that.
---
 I recommend leveling a farming alt such as a mage, hunter,  or lock. Or go holy pally and stand there and laugh as they take 30 mins to try and kill you.
---
Arena for sure, that’s the only feature I miss. Also that the game is less consumable dependant (I dislike stuff such as FAP that to me ruins class core mechanics), and the zones are more colourful.
---
So alliance are a bit racist basically. Apart from a good old fashion war. They probably call undead 'spooks'
---
&gt; but you can't argue picking 7 talents over the course of 100 levels is more complex than vanilla's system.
---
It is when you could go weeks/months without even needing to open your talent pane in vanilla. Once you picked your cookie-cutter build, that was no real need to change talents for anything ever again (respec costs were also prohibitive).
---
I've been killing these sunscales but they're not dropping the stolen silver... How many do I have to kill???
---
Fun for a bit, but dreadfully boring after a couple matches. There is a reason they changed it so many times during vanilla, and its not because people were having too much fun.
---
This was actually talked about heavily. What your referring to are the fast leveling and even insta 60 servers. But on the true classic servers that actually have a longer respawn and most have more hp/dodge and so forth.
---
https://youtu.be/u48WF9uIpZo
---
Every class, every spec.
---
It's a hard question to answer because it is literally, everything. It was self evident. Ret Paladins insisted they should compete on DPS charts. Bear druids insisted they should tank as well as warriors. AOE damage dealers insisted they should have better single target DPS. Burst damage classes complained about utility. Everyone wanted to be good at everything, choices stopped mattering.
---
Layering should not be used past the second week of official classic.
---
People could still grind rep with the quests in old AV, but that's the kind of thing classic shouldn't be catering to.
---
This tattoo is representative of how I feel about the alliance lol.
---
Vendor price. They are a grey item that can be looted from junkboxes. No one had any use for them besides vendoring them, so I doubt that they would sell on the AH.
---
I've been thinking about fixes for this a lot. Here's what I think:
---
&gt; Tag all rare spawns, nodes, chests, etc on a serverwide basis *(SO ALL LAYERS)*. This should be easy, just a hash of the item name and the spawn time, + the zone or x/y cords if it needs to be more unique.
---
&gt;  When an player loots, tags, taps, etc a tagged object - that player is locked to the object on a server-wide (all layer) basis. So when they jump layers, they don't see the item (or they can't loot it, at least). 
---
So in more detail, you'd have a hash of "Black Lotus" + spawn time (like 1560395348 epoch) + zone. All lotus spawn at the same time across all layers. If Player1 loots that lotus, they're 'locked' to that hash. If they see the hashed object in another layer, they can't loot it. 
---
I think that'd more-or-less solve the P1 issues. It's clunky af, but I reckon it's better than nothing.
---
If you're playing on a pvp server, a rogue duo is neat because you can both be stealthy ambushers and get up to all sorts of ganking shenanigans. Stealth into enemy cities and gank people in alleyways that recently hearthed in. Stealth into dungeons and farm stuff - like the Barman's Shanker dagger from Blackrock Depths!
---
I never played a healer back in the day but I want to main a priest this time. How is it at lvl 60? Can you farm herbs and stuff without getting killed by any mob because you don‘t deal any dmg? Herbalism and fishing are also my favorite professions but I‘m afraid of high level mobs as a non dmg dealer

When Keanu Reeves does a pushup, he dosnt push the world down. The world lifts up to be closer to him.
---
same reason they watch other streamers, crippling loneliness and it helps them pretend they're part of a community and have friends
---
"Time is money friend"
---
Yeah? Saturated devilsaur market? No mafia? I'm cool with that.
---
Underplayed for sure
---
Helcular's rod from yetis in Hillsbrad. Just did it on a p server and I did a level and half from grinding it out
---
maybe not 'chill', but he doesnt talk that much when he's playing, and he's actually really good (especially at pvp), just mute him when he starts complaining
---
That Polar bear has a stun or something to. Pretty handy pet! (Note because of the stun it is hard to get the bear tamed)
---
Had nothing to do with being a streamer, that didn't even cross my mind actually. It's just the fact that your comment reads exactly as, "I'm offended." Like, it adds nothing to any conversation on the internet. You just share your feeling on something that no one asked for as if everyone should care. That's more "snowflake hater" than "streamer fanboy."
---
Yes I realise it would take super long with same amount of players. I was thinking to only bring one player from every class so 8 or 9 if cross faction.
---
Maybe this goes under the radar cause it needs not be said- it’s instinct. For 14 years- I see a (geared) lock, I run
---
Plot twist: Gnomes are the real gold farmers
---
Will there be any special things you do when you level your character? Would be funny to have something done every level. Then when you hit 60 you'd do it for the last time. Bittersweet!
---
I haven't heard that name in years. Well I'm off to YouTube to listen to songs I haven't heard in 5 plus years. Need to create a playlist for when I get ready to pvp
---
There is still the problem of the chest here though... So, what, there's 1 chest for 2-3 layers? If one layer clears their chest first, does it despawn with players still fighting for it in other layers? It's a tough spot to be in.
---
People like this goof misusing the word autistic is the literal reason wow classic will fail.
---
Hey is this open to everyone or just the current beta testers?
---
"r/classicwow declares classic wow the most anticipated game of the year!"
---
I love it too bros, but this is the least credible endorsement since rolling stone magazine
---
Yeah I'm gonna give a big YIKES to Josh here. Sco said that in a straight, neutral tone, no smirks, no winks, he said it 100% seriously. I know that British sarcasm is far more subtle than American sarcasm but not to this extent.
---
I'm actually disappointed Method aren't going to compete in Classic, it would have been amazing to see the number 1 modern WoW raiding guild go up against Pserver legends like APES.
---
Or maybe Josh was misinformed? And Sco was being serious? Let's hope so.
---
What do you want to do with the class? PVE or PVP? Both?
---
Heal or DPS?
---
Either way Priest is an amazing class. Shadow Priest absolutely kill in pvp, Holy priest obviously take the crown when it comes to healing. Even if you level as shadow you can easily find groups for dungeons and heal for them (5man content).
---
I remember countless engagements against locks with my warrior but still died in the end, aswell the lock, the dots ripped me off quite often after he was dead 😂, but agree a good lock is a machine
---
I can’t figure it out either
---
In theory, if you hopped layers every time the chest spawned and won each chest, you could do Arena Grand Master trinket in 1 single 24 hour day. Getting double Nazjak spawns early is gonna be nutty.
---
To be fair, that wasn't really that much of a tell. I'm sure Sco has quite an ego on him, he does lead one of the best, if not the best modern WoW raiding guild out there so it wouldn't be too ridiculous to think he actually thought that.
---
So... you're not Classic Winds I'm assuming
---
Streamers already do it sometimes, so think it‘s gonna be a thing again
---
&gt; It just shows that raiding was easy enough that you could bring in people who had garbage specs and still kill bosses.
---
I think the other big factor was that for a lot of classes, talents didn't really make a HUGE difference. It was more about small boosts to your existing abilities as opposed to giving you ultra-powerful core abilities (there were exceptions of course). 
---
You could be picking terrible talents and still perform 90-95% as well as someone who had the optimal spec. 
---
In retail the difference between optimal vs non-optimal feels like night and day, and has a huge impact on playstyle and ability usage.
---
And if he was smirking it must have been the most subtle, tiniest smirk I have ever seen. You must be a wizard for spotting it!
---
I’ve mained a Feral Druid from WoD to BFA and have, for the most part, enjoyed it more than other classes I have max level (mage, warrior &amp; shaman). I played very casually throughout BC &amp; WotLK and never touched a Druid. 
---
Will I enjoy playing as a Druid in classic? 
---
Do they have a similar feeling as Retail?
---
CoA &gt; Corruption. CoA lasts longers and does increased damage every few ticks, with he last ticks doing the most damage. If you think are going to kill an enemy really fast, for example in a dungeon on a 1 mob pull don't even bother with CoA, it will just eat up Mana and not do it's fullest damage.
---
I meant once you get a Green Weapon, much like how casters get their Greater Magic Wand.
---
I just don't see it as tedious or slow. I was MUCH slower on any ranged character I tried and my Rogue.
---
The only characters I've ever leveled faster than a Warrior was Paladin and Druid.
---
I've leveled 4 Warriors from 1-110 and two of those to 120. By far my favorite class with over 180 Days /played on my main one.
---
You mean when warlocks chain fear players back to retail
---
Wasn't my comment you goober
---
Sorry to hear about your Gma - but I'm glad Blizzard showed her some love! She must've been a true fan!
---
And now its a King Leoric quote in HoTS lol
---
&gt; Elwynn is just terrible and confused.
---
Wait, how? It flows just fine.
---
(I am on mobile right now, but if no one else does it, I will dig the clip up when I get home)
---
Someone posted a twitch clip from  (I believe it was) Tribe where he hamstrings a mob and backpeddles wich results in him being able to hit the mob without getting any return hits. So *something* is definitly off with the way melee range works.
---
Yes 1.12 AV has no reinforcements, but the health and damage of a lot of NPCs were nerfed and some of the weird stuff like the troll boss are removed. You can still summon the ancients and other stuff and matches will probably still last an hour or so, but it won't be the days long slog of old or 10 minute rush of the present. Personally I think 1.12 is gonna be the sweet spot.
---
I’d assume Discord + “on the count of three” = beautiful coordination during the battlefights
---
That's only the 2rd time he's done it.
---
Well if that dosnt date the early to mid 2000's I dont know what does.
---
50 Cent and Vanilla WoW. Amazing.
---
There's not going to be 5x as many mobs to tag. Splitting up the group would be way better.
---
You're just gonna end up being underleveled because mobs are gonna give 20% of their normal exp and you'll be stranded with nothing to do but grind mobs - which is terrible to do if you're in a group that big.
---
I loved helping hunters with hibernate back then
---
Sorry the Taco curse came to your land. 
---
Some day I hope you are blessed with a real taco.
---
Love this, amazing piece of art.
---
Yes a Spirit Gear Macro is preferred
---
You and like 500 others &gt;_&lt;
---
I went to go watch and it and it's not available to stream anymore. Figures.
---
Rppvp servers were only available in vanilla for like a year and change, just sayin
---
UBRS has an attunement. Onyxia has an attunement.  MC has an attunement. Black Wing Lair has one.  Naxx has one. 
---
The attunements in and off themselves aren’t too bad, and I actually enjoy the content. But when you are trying to build a 50+ person raid roster for a consistent 40 person team it’s fucking annoying.  When players numbers are dropping, people aren’t showing up to raids, you’re constantly having I recruit new players (and get them attuned) it’s fucking annoying.
---
this is actually TBC but my point still stands :) mageee
---
Layering is such garbage blizz!! Are you listening?
---
I don't want to get killed by mobs when I switch layers 15 minutes into a non-instanced cave!

Based on the pattern at the bottom, looks like it's just north of Swamp of Sorrows in Eastern Kingdom

I will be too. 15 hrs a day ez. Took time off, gf knows, have plenty of savings. Ezpz. Gotta take time to enjoy the things you love in life.
---
Gotcha. And that totally makes sense.
---
At this point, same. Even if they somehow make a great expansion, the legacy content and the 15 year inflation-wrecked economy will still be sitting there in the background.
---
Way to dickpunch me in the feels. My sister played with me during WotLK. She came with me to Best Buy for the midnight release. Still gets my eyes misty when I think back. Luckily I still have her in my life but she has newborn twins and a 6 year old so highly doubt she'll play Classic.
---
*Assuming Black Lotus 35 minute spawn timer for purely illustrative purposes*
---
Black Lotus is harvested on Layers 1 and 3.  
---
Black Lotus on Layer 2 remains.
---
30 minutes later, Layer 2 Black Lotus is harvested.  
---
Do all 3 layers spawn ~5 minutes later?
---
He did do shadow for a while, but people like me and my brother on low level pvp twinks are probably why he got fixed
---
Also the word boss Lethon. Legit made me shit myself the first time I went exploring there. I had so many questions lol.
---
There would still be 1 chest per layer. This would just stop one player from getting the same chest twice. 
---
Layering is going to result in lots of duplicated nodes - if 3 layers are running on a server, there will be 3x the copper nodes for example. This *hopefully* evens out. Since 3x the people need the ore supply &amp; demand stays roughly the same. But, realistically, damage will be done - lack of scarcity is intrinsic to layering and can't be avoided. 
---
That being said, we can make sure it's not exploited (drastically) by a minority of the playerbase. Locking players (or groups) to nodes/spawns/chests will help smooth out phase 1. And hopefully decentivise folks from layer hopping for exploits.
---
It definitely acts inconsistently. You can't see it in the vid, but he was invited by this priest a minute or so before. He then relogged while in the priests group and still respawned outside the priest's layer. He then dropped group, got RE-INVITED and then magically phased to the priest's layer where he was able to get the chest.
---
I was fucking laughing out loud that you used runback time as an excuse until I thought about it. Wiping *was* actually meaningful, raising the stakes on many encounters for guilds without infinite time. Guilds also had finite resources with which to buy/make pots and mats for the raids unlike today when that's a joke. Even repairs were a fucking pain in the ass. World pvp was literally an obstacle to getting folks into the fucking instance.
---
Players might be a bit more fine-tuned now than they were by the time BC rolled around, but really it's just that current players raid in a game that holds their hand until the moment the encounter starts, and gives them a big fluffy cushion to land on when they fail.
---
Wow. Such a blast from the past! Thanks so much for posting that!!
---
Easiest fix would be a simple 10min debuff blocking gathering and chest looting after xferring phases via friend invite. Would be enough of a deterrent to stop most of the issues.
---
What is a more anticipated PC game that's coming out in 2019?  There are a bunch of console games coming out, but not really shit in the way of PC exclusives that are gonna be super big.  Maybe Magic, but that's kind of already out even though it's in eternal beta.
---
&gt; the most anticipated PC game of the year.
---
for ~135k people
---
You can apply that bad logic to the horde too, you have roided green humans, skinny blue humans, rotting humans and cow-people. The troll accent and the way they speak is really making me reconsider playing horde as a main, especially after BFA and all the voice-acted trolls.
---
*shoots up some meth: LET GET THIS FUCKIN DONE
---
  It’s probably doable if you legit did meth or addy... I don’t condone that nor would I do it myself but the human body is a crazy thing when you take drugs like that.
---
Looking for NA PVE Human Priest for Duo-leveling on Classic Launch!
---
I am looking for someone that is playing Human Priest on NA PVE and also interested in Duo Leveling when Classic WoW launches in August.
---
Based on testing done throughout the beta and on private servers, it is pretty clear that duo leveling is the best way to avoid the multitude of early game struggles while leveling up on a fresh character.
---
I plan on rolling Human Rogue and will be taking a week off of work for Classic launch to play as much as I can to get ahead of the crowd. For example on launch day I'd like to do a 24+hr session if all goes smoothly.
---
With that said, I'm not demanding that you have to be some sort of godlike Vanilla WoW player. Even though I started back at the end of Vanilla I am far from an expert and have definitely forgotten a LOT over the past years and expansions.
---
Recently I have been doing a lot of theory-crafting and testing on level routes/other ways to avoid the crowd that will be present at launch.
---
If this is something you would be interested in feel free to reply below or add me on Discord at Mikey#8280
---
Wash yer back
---
[Glimmering Mithril Insignia](https://classicdb.ch/?item=10418)
---
Bought one of these. DOA
---
*woosh*
---
Each layer would operate on it's own timer.
---
But if you harvested the Winterspring 8:00am node, you wouldn't be eligible for a Winterspring 8:20am node on a new layer. 
---
I'm not sure the *exact* mechanic behind Black Lotus spawning - but I remember it being **only one lotus at a time, per zone**. So simply locking a player out of herbing Lotus in Winterspring for 1hour seems reasonable to me.
---
incredibly tasteless dude
---
I‘m no warlock specialist, but i can agree on this explanation!

I died during the first stress test while in the hardest cave of Teldrassil, Ban'ethil Barrow Den, because my group shifted layers and aggroed 4 mobs that appeared out of nowhere. I died and did nothing wrong at all, and had to run back to my corpse which took like 3 minutes. My group was nice enough to wait for me even though they had all completed the quest we were doing, but it was so upsetting. That would never happen in vanilla, 4 mobs never just appeared out of nowhere all at once.
---
If I played for only 1 day and that happened in the first major non-instanced dungeon I did, it will be totally unacceptable if it happens on a daily basis during the actual release. Dying at the end of a non-instanced dungeon due to layering is total bullshit and NOT FUN. And yet, doing non-instanced dungeons with random people is the bread and butter of Vanilla. If I join someone's group and then it wipes us, that is game breaking.
---
There's that joke from classic: "Warlocks are OP! Plz nerf Shadow Priests again!" It is funny because it is mostly true. Blizzard never really nerfed Warlocks successfully, but did manage to bash Priest's head in with a rock in the cross-fire. Hard to nerf a class that they gave Fear, Seduce, and Death Coil to, particularly when you only ever target the first one and they're on separate DR.     
---
That being said though, Rogues (particularly UD) still gave Warlocks a run for their money. As did geared Warriors (even if they ultimately died after the 'lock due to DoTs).
---
more lotuses, more devilsaur =&gt; lower price
---
i say bring it on
---
While I understand CoA lasts longer than corruption, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s more efficient to use it before corruption (for damage).
---
It boggles my mind how often my best friend got loot in raids as a Druid.
---
Cloth stuff casters pass on, leather DPS stuff and then all the actual Druid gear on-top of that.
---
Did they actually take the ancients and everything out of AV? I thought that stuff was still in there: just everyone ignored it.
---
While I think there is definitely *potential* to game the system, I think watching the beta with so few people in it exacerbates the problem. I don't think people realize just how many people are going to be at the starting line. The only reason you would be able to get a duplicate item is if the extra layer is empty.  It's going to be packed. Plus the amount of coordination it takes to switch across layers .....All for what...the chance at an extra lotus? As if there aren't going to be hundreds farming that material in every layer....
---
I am a goober fuck
---
The heroes we need but don't deserve.
---
In IF it wasn't uncommon to hear the stealth sound while running through the corridors and occasionally get sapped, and I would just be like "oh great here we go again...".
---
Keanu tried to play a Druid but he could never complete the aquatic form quest.  You see every time he tried to hop into the lake he didn’t get wet, the water got Keanued.
---
if you use your imagination hard enough, you can make them go at it
---
Nice.
---
You mean when raids were literally impossible due to game breaking bugs (Kael'thas), poor tuning (C'Thun), poor encounter design (Four Horsemen), or technical limitations of the time (Thaddius was known for causing people to DC)?  But lets go over the raids in order.  I am using [Method's raid history information for some of the earlier kills](https://www.method.gg/raid-history/vanilla) and only going over the main (40/25 man) ones since they are what Method has the most information on.
---
&gt; Vanilla
---
Remember, that the game was fresh and that people had to level all 60 levels to reach end game.  So MC and Onyxia are, expectedly, going to have a higher than normal first clear times.
---
Onyxia was up for 69 days.  
---
MC was cleared in 154 days.  That was the longest a raid boss was ever up.
---
BWL took 77 days, but only Nef was still up after the first week.
---
AQ40 took 113 days, but only 3 bosses (Viscidus, Ouro, and C'thun) lasted past the first week.
---
Naxx took 90 days with the biggest wall being Four Horsemen, stalling guilds for almost 60 of those days.  Once they fell, KT was dead within 14 days.
---
&gt; TBC
---
There were 5 raids available on launch.  Karazahn, Grull's Lair, Magtheridon's Laid, Serpentshrine Cavern, and Tempest Keep: The Eye.  The last two also required attunments, thought SSC was relatively simple, TK's was not.  I bring this up since there is going to be an obvious delay due to leveling and completing attunments for these raids.
---
Grull Lasted 19 days and Magtheridon lasted 40.
---
SSC took 73 days.  Vashj was known for being a buggy fight and it shows in the fact that Nihilum got their first kill due to a bug.
---
TK had the longest attument, so it is expected that it was the last one started.  TK stood for 130 days, but from the first kill to the last it only took 42 days.  And a large portion of that was due to multiple bugs in the KT fight.
---
Hyjall stood for 26 days.  Only Archimonde made it past the first week
---
BT stood for 21 days.  Three bosses made it past the first week, but only Illidan made it past 10 days.
---
SWP stood for 62 days.  However, this is only due to gating.  Every boss was killed within a week of it being available.
---
&gt; WotLK 
---
Tier 7 (Naxx, Sarth, Mally) were cleared in the first week *of the expansion* while many of the raid members were still wearing Sunwell gear.  It took them less time to get 10 levels and clear all the raids than it took most to even finish leveling.
---
Tier 8 (Ulduar) took longer at 85 days, but there were a few reasons for this.  The 'hard modes' weren't known to be anything other than achievements, like in Naxx, until the raid was already underway.  And what many considered the final boss (Algalon) only allowed guilds 1(?) hour a week to do attempts.  Alone in the Darkness wasn't even considered possible by most until Stars did it.
---
Tier 9 (TotC), Tribute to Insanity, was cleared in the first week Heroic mode was available.
---
Tier 10 (ICC) took 46 days from when Heroic was available until the first 25 LK kill happened.  But LK was the only true bottle neck in part due to the limited attempts that guilds were given.  Every other boss was killed within the first week of Heroic mode being available.
---
Tier 10.5 (Ruby Sanctum) was cleared on the first day.
---
&gt; My thoughts
---
The majority of bosses have fallen within the first week they were available.  There were a few exceptions, but these were often (not always) due to gating, poor design, poor QA, poor tuning, or some of the limitations of the time.  When you compare this to Legion/BFA, even with all of the advancement in raid techniques, technological advancements, increased skill level, and tools to dissect an encounter, you never see the final boss killed in the first week.
---
Out of all of the flaws that Retail WoW has, it's raid design and QA team are not one of them.
---
Long post here. I’m so torn. It’s stressing me out. I just want to choose. Any help would be amazing. I’ve been back and forth for a year now. I think I need to get all my internal thoughts on each choice I have on paper so that you guys can maybe assist me. All I know is I want to play one of the meta DPS classes. Here is my situation:
---
I want to play horde, and I want to do a lot of world pvp, both group and solo. I want to dabble in BGs but not really push ranks, I don’t have the playtime to push ranks. In order to be geared for fun successful pvp, I therefore will need to raid too. So, I’m looking to raid as a means to collect gear and use it to progress tiers in classic and pvp in the world both in groups and solo, as well as occasional BGs, in all of classic. I therefore will be playing not casual but not hardcore. Somewhere between. 
---
Wanting to be a meta dps class in raid means my choices are warrior, rogue, mage, warlock, and hunter. Here’s my thoughts on each class and why I PERSONALLY want to play and do not want to play each. Any help choosing based on my goals and the pros and cons I am seeing would be hugely appreciated:
---
WARRIOR
---
Pros: 
---
-Fun, I love the fantasy. 
---
-Powerhouse in group pvp. 
---
-Tank in dungeons for pre bis, meaning I can be picky on parties and get my gear fast. 
---
Cons:
---
-Bad solo pvp overall. I wanna enjoy going solo sometimes in world pvp. 
---
-I’m a little intimidated by classic tanking. 
---
-Ultra gear dependent and I have a job and warriors are super popular. I get worried about not being strong enough due to falling behind in gearing. 
---
-Terrible to level. 
---
ROGUE
---
Pros:
---
-In my opinion the funnest pve rotation in both raids and dungeons. 
---
-My most played class in my 14 Years in WoW. I love the flavor and aesthetic. 
---
-Solo pvp monster 
---
-Stealth is amazing for various tasks
---
-Low tier in group pvp battles, which I want to participate in. Not good in most cases in BGs either. 
---
-Cooldown dependant
---
-Overpopulated, I worry about pre bis and raid spots and gear competition
---
-Slower leveling than most
---
MAGE
---
-Fantastic in all areas of content I want to play
---
-Quality of life with portals and water and food and aoe gold farm
---
-Useful in dungeons compared to most other dps 
---
-Good leveler
---
-Incredibly fun to play in pvp 
---
-Not too gear dependant
---
 Cons:
---
-Biggest con for me is how boring the raid rotation is. Hours at a time spamming one button sounds awful. I would roll one in a heartbeat but I’m apprehensive because of how boring I feel like raid would be. 
---
-I am concerned about overpopulation. Everyone knows mages are great in all content. I feel like competition for spots and gear would be tough. 
---
-Ugly gear
---
WARLOCK
---
-Useful in all pve content, amazing in pvp once very geared a couple raids in 
---
-Amazing flavor, theme, tier sets 
---
-Efficient fast leveling 
---
-Wanted and needed for groups, under populated compared to other dps 
---
-Free mount
---
-1v1 gods
---
-Again, horribly boring rotation. 
---
-No threat control like mage and rogue scares me
---
-Life Tap makes me feel like a drain on healers. 
---
-Horrible pvp until very geared. Likely not great in pvp until at least BWL
---
HUNTER
---
-Engaging rotation 
---
-World pvp gods, solo and group 
---
-Ranged benefits in pve 
---
-Early patches high dps 
---
-Unrivaled leveling and world efficiency solo
---
-Dead zone is annoying to me 
---
-I’m not crazy about the flavor 
---
-late vanilla has low dps 
---
-worried about raid spots compared to other classes
---
-I do not know how to play the class in pvp at all yet. Others, I have skill already.

Dungeon blues are enough to make you competitive in PvP as long as you're playing a class that wins with control, not brute force. Mages, Hunters and Druids are very good for this. Pick one of those classes if you want to compete in blues.
---
Don't pick Warrior or Warlock if you want to be competitive while in blues.

Using Rank 1 seal of command, you have almost literally 0 recovery time from levels 25-60. I'm talking 2.5+ kills a minute, with 20 minutes before you need to stop for a drink.
---
That's plenty fast.
---
In earlier vanilla patches you were unable to use a mount in Undercity as it was considered "indoors"
---
I'd imagine he doesn't come off will in snippets since much of the humor is in the drastic swings between self-deprecation and unexpected, mortifying arrogance.

It's kind of like judging a standup comedian (maybe Louis C.K.) based on a 20 second clip of a joke out of their hour long special. Often times that joke will be a reference back so something they set up earlier, so the clip does not provide context.

Play with kittens and go outside or go into a pool or do productive work... Where was I!
---
This is the true answer
---
A Crit and two normal strikes killed mobs your level no different than a mage casting 3x fireball.
---
Mage then has to sit and eat/drink, Warrior can keep going until his health is low. Once you start gearing for Regen you literally never have to stop.
---
Mages always reach a point where they have to stop and eat/drink or evocate (or whatever it's called).
---
Once a caster gets a Greater Magic Wand and higher they fly. Same thing goes for a Warrior getting any 2h green weapon after level 8.
---
the first time maybe, then it gets more and more annoying when all you want is marks
---
Suddenly the game becomes even easier then before, i’d rather Blizz didn’t introduce welfare flasks..
---
This is such an obvious problem with layering, I mentioned it regarding Black Lotus when it was announced.
---
I'm not criticizing the content of the claim, rather the credibility.
---
It's not shared. Only 100% drop items are shared with everyone.
---
What's the fun in that?
---
Shit Ok i’m totally wrong. I retract my comment lol
---
Laughs in Undead Warrior.
---
Both Silent Hill movies
---
...and then boast about how good they are by winning 10-6 matches where they still die 9 times.
---
Oh come on. Think about all the joy it's bringing all the people in this thread lol. Small sacrifice for making the world a bit happier.
---
I actually think this is amazing. Groups of trolls ganking people on a server brings me back to just knowing people on certain servers. Really dope
---
It's a bit prejudice but I can't say I particularly blame the alliance for rejecting the forsaken. I'm a lifelong horde player, but from the perspective of regular people and soldiers in this world, they've been invaded by a hostile species from another realm, who burned down their city and years later claim that they were under the influence of an evil space army of demons (which was true).
---
Then, in another human kingdom, not long after a large group of imprisoned orcs escape and flee the continent entirely, people suddenly begin turning into horrible ghouls and eating their loved ones and neighbors. An entire kingdom is destroyed and its citizens converted into monsters, who eventually claim to have broken free of the influence that a single undead leader was able to exert over them, whilst simultaneously continuing to be led by a single undead leader.
---
Straight up that's sketchy as fuck. I can see why Orcs would be accepting of the undead. I can even see why some humans might eventually want to reconnect with the forsaken, but I think in their position a bit of prejudice is just a survival mechanism. It just wouldn't make sense to trust any of them after seeing all that go down, even if it was actually the right thing to do.
---
Looool
---
Going to fuck with World PvP in a big way. If its easily manipulated like modern WoW - people can just phase into a new layer instead of getting ganked for example.
---
This doesn’t even trigger nostalgia, it’s just flat out cheesy and bad.
---
Ah the good ol dotty fear soulfire combo!
---
Which is ironic, because by virtue of playing Alliance, it is literally more difficult to PvP, making many Alliance players far superior than their horde counterparts (if they stick with it).
---
DoN't WoRrY, iTs OnLy BeTa!
---
 - If you have Nightfall use Corruption first.    
---
 - If you have Rank 7 Corruption use that first.    
---
 - If the mob won't survive 24 seconds, use Corruption.     
---
Otherwise use CoA. It is cheaper. It also deals more DPS than Rank 6 Corruption (initial 60 spell).
---
This can't be happening. Blizzard has to fix this.
---
135k people subscribed to a sub that an offshoot of the wow sub which has over a million and also talks about classic in almost every thread, and the game don't even come out yet for a whole nother 3 months.  
---
Asmongold clearing Deadmines in a fucking beta test was the number 1 thing on Twitch.  That's fucking INSANE!
---
Blizz didn't even want to make this fucking game.  The people demanded it. 
---
I ain't seen no hype like this for a PC exclusive in a long time.
---
We making Azeroth great again.
---
&gt; some of you will end up in a hospital I am paying for.
---
Socialized healthcare systems treat WoW overdoses?
---
An Alliance player WOULD have a scented candle at their desktop.
---
Stoneskin and escape artist are mostly pvp racials, but they're not as amazing as stun resist or wotf.  
---
But Alliance has great pve racials for each class.  
---
Warrior/Paladin/Rogue : Human weapon expertise is BiS for both tanking and melee dps  
---
Druid/Rogue : Night elves get bonus dodge% and have a higher stealth level.  
---
Priest : Dwarves get fear ward  
---
Mage/Warlock : Gnomes get 5% bonus int.  
---
Hunters don't really get any pve bonus on either side.
---
Alright thanks so much for the info, I'll bring it up with my friends.
---
If CoA doesn't get all of it's ticks you are losing effiency on it so you always want to make sure if your using it, it can run it's full duration. If you are tagging multiple mobs in a dungeon you want to primarily use Corruption so you can get more nightfall procs.  If you're out in the world pulling 1 or 2 mobs, hit them with a CoA then a corruption and wand.
---
Poor alliance..... have to face both undead and orcs.
---
Also I heard the laugh just by reading this lol
---
It's funny because you can see a hunter actually jump into the arena and start to come for Ven.
---
Warlocks are the strongest class in a 1v1 fair fight. No question. But they're weak in groups because they have no outs and all of their damage can be prevented via defensive dispels. The melee on an organized team are going to attack you until you die and there is nothing you can do about it. Even in world PvP, I think that Rogues and Druids come out ahead thanks to stealth.
---
It's not that people forgot about Warlocks. It's just that their niche (duels) isn't very important. That would change if we ever get something like 2v2 arena in Classic.
---
&gt; For Classic I'd guess 30% or so of people (unique log-ins) will actually hit 60 eventually. Out of those I'd expect a high % of them to at least step foot into a raid.
---
Noooooppeeee
---
Also conveniently forgetting that humans set them free and humans helped them in the end. The same humans the savages slaughter today.
---
Nyhm and Oxhorn were my jam. I reminisced about them with a few friends of mine recently. Anyone remember Chronicle of the Annoying Quest?
---
Thank you so much for the detailed reply I really appreciate it
---
GD layering is so bad.
---
I will also pretend to know OPs situation.
---
Yea Chucks a great guy!
---
There was a forum thread in vanilla that was titled "What to do when you get feared as a Druid". The entire thread was things you could go do outside of the game in 30 seconds....
---
I'd honestly rather just have one singular server with like 5k players. Even if it ends up with 2.5, that's still a fairly high pop by actual vanilla standards.
---
I own a dog.  You can trust me.
---
Here's my hunter video, I hit hard: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvgajLF0\_lI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvgajLF0_lI)
---
Thanks!
---
Maybe think about getting a "standing desk" so you can break up the seated wowing with some standing wowing for a few minutes every hour or so?
---
Haha when I don't shower for days playing vanilla gotta help with the stench since I don't live alone!
---
I agree, blizzard is playing with something they shouldn't be.  Just a well populated server is all that is needed.  Layering is going to F shit up.  The only logic I've heard for layer is its for the "Fresh" server inflow, but I suspect it will go well past the mega inflow expected. Perhaps up to be a perma thing.
---
Thank you very much!
---
Warrior is the single slowest class to level, bar none.
---
The game is less than 3 months out from launch. Something really must be done about layering asap.
---
And that's the scary part, right? Say a server starts with 15k across 5 layers and it dwindles to 6 or 7k... that's more than double the pop of vanilla servers, and after phase 1 ends, that server is fucked. Then what?
---
Pretty sure most classes that perform their "intended" role like warrior tanks, druid healer etc. wear their tier gear, although you might have to look into how many pieces you wear
---
I absolutely love this series, well done. 
---
Please keep it up!
---
People will be playing on servers based in their own regions, this means during off hours the population will be low unlike on private where the pop is high at all times thanks to China, Russia, EU ect.
---
It seems so poorly though out, to be honest.
---
I'm not a fan or tauren resto druid.  Otherwise I'd agree.  But if resto, NE all the way bby
---
Just end retail already and make WoW 2 lol
---
Mage or warlock? I’m having a hard time choosing...
---
Sell her for .75¢
---
Put a lid on that water bottle you freak!
---
That’s the best thing that ever happened to you? Must live a sad life.
---
Imagine posting this comment on multiple posts.
---
It would have to be something like that or Classic players would go crazy. All the old toys, mounts, achievements, etc that Retail has and Classic doesn't? I'd end up just playing my old Retail characters.
---
You mean seduce? Fear is too janky.
---
Had a ZG 20 that turned out horribly because the raid leader assumed priests healed / pallys too. We got half-way into the dungeon before we realized there was 3 rets and 2 spriests. When you see how poorly they perform on the charts - leech is definitely the word that comes to mind.
---
What race for alliance is best for priests ?
---
I'm not sure how to measure press coverage, but Doom Eternal's 2018 teaser (yes, just the *teaser*) has 14mil views, and the gameplay trailer has 4.6m views. That's more than pretty much all the WoW Classic announcement stuff combined. 
---
I'm extremely hyped for both WoW Classic and Doom this year.
---
The thing about our opinions of flying is that you cannot predict what we will think about flying when it comes out in burning crusade in perhaps three years or so. We know how we feel about it now. But we have no idea how we are going to feel about it after having spent three years on foot for all of our traveling. It certainly won't happen with everyone but some of us will be excited about flying again when it comes out again. That's how the brain works, you get a tolerance to something, you abstain from it, then when you return to it your brain finds more joy in it
---
Best for me was “12 days of winterveil” by oxhorn
---
90% of value of that helm is the hit though.
---
Professional customer support.
---
I've played on a few private servers. I'm grateful that I was able to play the game for free and I'm glad that I played on them. But man, the servers that I played on were run by total morons. You might as well never report any bugs or ask for support if something goes wrong on a private server because the "support" you receive will just infuriate you and leave a bad taste in your mouth.
---
I look forward to playing on a server that's run by a company that has every incentive to keep me playing their game. Subscription fees are a difference maker.
---
Almost the entire video is muted due to copyright.
---
I reckon it has already stolen the spot of most anticipated game of 2020 lol.
---
Thanks man!
---
Isn’t it better to only use 3 points in shadow focus since 5 is pvp overkill so you can get shadow reach or weaving?
---
Unfortunately this is the way WoW is designed - 10% of the time you'll do 300% of the *thing* so that simpletons can be excited over large numbers popping up.
---
Well I can tell you with certainty that's not true.
---
Well another part of what determines your leveling speed and efficiency is how long you are able to play. Namely before getting bored or demotivated for the day. And I know many people would be able to play for much longer without getting bored or tired if they sprinkle a few dungeon runs in between hours of questing.
---
I heard my name, I am here.
---
Being hyperbolic, no need to be rude.
---
The dude saved me thousands getting a shitty tattoo removed lol
---
They could just add the Grand Marshal/High Warlord items for LVL 58 and have them cost Honor or Rep just so that players have some crazy incentive.
---
But honestly why are people grinding and getting BiS items on Beta characters? I don't understand that. I'd be testing quests and interactions / spells / BG's etc 
---
You know, what Beta testers should be doing.
---
I'm not really sure what your argument is. You have the data available for aggregate boss DPS across all logs. Whatever this \*non-representative\* example is, it's still only a single data point. I figured by providing you the means to see out the answers yourself, you'd be happy and not nitpicky.
---
Apparently I'm wrong. So here, let me go pull up the rankings \*for you.\*
---
Overall Naxx DPS: [https://imgur.com/a/jjjfT3d](https://imgur.com/a/jjjfT3d)
---
Paladin Naxx DPS: [https://imgur.com/a/91ZPSuE](https://imgur.com/a/91ZPSuE)
---
Paladin isn't brought because people can't do damage with it. Mourtagh is about the only noteworthy paladin who can do more damage than a hunter. There's a few more decent paladin parsers for AQ40. The reasoning for this gap is explained in the post I linked earlier.
---
It told me I would take a year to level a rogue playing 6 hours a week at a normal speed.
---
That's complete horseshit lol
---
I mean really any song by Linkin Park mixed in with some Drowning Pool ought to do the trick.
---
Love the Ooga Gang, awesome entertainment!
---
But, forgive me for asking, wasn't the point that they wanted to kill attention seeking streamers or something like that?
---
Didn't think they'd ask for attention like this themselves...
---
when i heard they will release Classic, i thought... fuuuuck, im gonna loose everything, well, ive already lost a lot, going to loose a lot more, i want to play the good old vanilla wow due to the fact that retail wow is ... s...h...i...t... for some of us that played Vanilla,  im already  practising on private servers to level 30-40 to get ahead of the curve.. it takes alot of time and jesus i miss the old if you pull more than 1-2 mobs while leveling you DIE and have to run to your corpse witch takes 10+ minutes... 
---
im probl gonna be around the top 100 in reaching level 60 on my server and hope that i can grind/farm for my epic mount/raid gear/raid pots in peace 
---
\^\^ :) :P

going for Horde PVP EU

Imagine starting your sentences with the word "imagine" in 2019
---
Imagine shit talking, while also having read every post in the "new" section of WoW Classic.
---
Imagine being so bored that you remembered a specific user and a specific comment so clearly that you know he posted it twice, because you're in every thread lol
---
Now that would be a said. Good thing we're just imagining it and none of this actually happened :)
---
Thanks, I never noticed how completely nonsensical, climate-wise, Azeroth was
---
Is 24 in ~55 hours somewhat decent or what?
---
You’re being a condescending shit
---
This entire subreddit was hooting and hollering that "YOU CAN'T JUST CHANGE YOUR LAYER!" every damn day the past month.
---
Even if you showed them countless clips showing streamers switching layers on demand they would be in denial and spout "Trust in Blizzard" nonsense.
---
I was thinking Linkin Park but I wasn't sure the others because it was so long ago.
---
So they hate streamers, yet are relying on streamer's content to make themselves known and turn a profit on youtube. Seems like they're opening themselves up to a lot of strikes from streamers they've  annoyed claiming their content.
---
This is really good! This also shows that there is plenty of places blizz could add post naxx if we go the OSRS route... I mean they're literally sitting on empty, yet already in game zones! It just makes sense to expand classic beyond naxx so players have new things to experience and helps give classic longevity.
---
Good job!
---
Yes but at the same time poor orc warlocks have to deal with Paladins dispelling almost everything they’ve got so the grass is always greener.
---
Anduin's father is... Arthas...
---
Not using a TKL for superior ergonomics and increased desk space (which you need imo). For shame. 
---
Shame this man.
---
I hope they go with this instead of releasing TBC. Give it a great endgame.
---
Literally two days ago my guild was running a quick MC run and this nice epic dagger dropped. Our guilds Rogue won the roll - one of the PUGs got salty and started harassing the guildy. We kicked the PUG and the following wipe we began to have problems with instance ID’s. The dude managed to stay in MC and stop other people from playing any further.
---
It might be because its a private server so the “sweaty tryhard” culture is in full force but never underestimate the power of malicious players on the internet. People getting angry over stupid things.
---
Honestly laughing at the thought of a Fire Mage in MC spamming super long / weak Frostbolts so noone notices.
---
i was about to comment this
---
Majority of players won't be 60 until October and after.
---
That's fine though, just means the MC/Ony runs for Alts and off specs will have spots free.
---
I’m pro layer/sharding, but at this point just remove the “feature” after day 1-3 or something. Don’t keep it for the entirety of stage 1
---
Exp split won’t be an issue as it diminishes down to around 25-30%, so provided you’re killing at least 4 mobs in the time you would kill 1 solo, then your exp will be on par/better.
---
Mob density may be an issue for some quests and you’ll spend a long time grinding mobs for item drop chance quests while you will breeze through #kill quests. Provided you don’t get bored this should be fine.
---
Escort quests will be considerably easier and group quests will always be completed. I would recommend you structure levelling around dungeon quests as you will be able to group for and clear dungeons without time wasting.
---
Your biggest downside is co-ordination. If one player decides to do additional quests will he others are offline or vice-versa then you’ll probably get frustrated waiting for them to catch up. 
---
If you all login within 5min of each other, consistently when you want to play, then levelling should be fun and very easy/laid back.
---
PvP gear is fine, but you wont be getting much of that playing only 8 hours per week either. it would prob be hard to get higher than rank 6. @ 8 hrs per week.
---
Blizzard has had a lot of issues with that specific flag you're talking about being set too late for some reason. I did enough of the Nether Portal farming to know that you could consistently get more than 50 a day due to that. It's affected other things in the past as well, just can't think of any right now. Hopefully they'd just implement it better.
---
In what world would it be necessary for more than a few days? I'm with you
---
Thats assuming randoms on the internet want to learn. 9.9 out of 10 times the person will just act like your insulting them for suggesting a better way to play.
---
Drowning Pool - Bodies hit the Flaw
---
Disturbed - Down with the sickness
---
Disturbed - Droping Plates
---
My three picks
---
You'd start to hallucinate after 72 Hours and probably would lack the sheer willpower it would take to stay awake in a seated position looking at a monitor doing mundane quests/grinds. 
---
You'd drift off and pass out.
---
We definitely plan on doing dungeons at the appropriate levels to experience them all. Would be a nice break from questing for sure.
---
WARRIOR! You might have incredible strength and you could probably own somebody's face but you are worthless without a priest you are destined to raid for all your life.
---
Throw some disturbed in there, maybe some drowning pool, and can’t touch this by mc hammer
---
No way unless Anduin was three years old when was going all have you come to stay in Stormwind
---
Same here,  but I had the opposite effect.  🤷‍♂️
---
I never looked as needing windfury... but it was nice and saved my ass sometimes
---
You would not have a good time on a 5k server with the authentic spawn timers, it would be a genuine nightmare.
---
I would pay money to see the full feature film in the theater.
---
That’s it, I’m watching the episode.
---
I feel like waiting 20 minutes extra for say a Frost Mage would actually be faster then the oomkin who needs to drink constantly and has half the DPS.
---
I personally don’t care enough to stop someone, but that AoE!
---
Do it like the Druids in the general channel. You and me baby ain’t nothing but mammals...
---
Thank you
---
God streamers are fucking annoying
---
So much for me.
---
Making a Blood Elf for the first time. Those starting zones were great.
---
The experience of a bunch of 60s in Hellfire Peninsula battling for supremacy.
---
The entire Illidan/Broken storyline.

The PVP! Arenas and the reskinned teir gear for PvP gear.
---
DUDE SAME HAHAHAH!
---
Yep, one of 1000000 downsides with layers... i really hope they rethink it...
---
Yo Blizzard. hire this guy.
---
The bosses go down. I finish top 3 melee. Seems fine to me.
---
Yes well done and Im talking about the digger in barrens.
---
Kara.
---
The most undervalued raid in WoW
---
I think the rogue t2 8set was very good for pve and pvp. The pieces themselves had dodge on them and gloves had immune disarm lol. Was a little strange.
---
Affliction was king for leveling until 50+ when you got the Felguard and that wasn’t even around til BC iirc. Idk why he thought Demo was better but that dude is stupid af.
---
I'm not pretending you are ignoring the definition of complex you are literally ignoring the definition of complex. I cited 3 definitions from the highest rated dictionaries in the English language and your response is that I was arguing semantics. I have provided evidence that your definition of complex isnt correct and you have dismissed it with no counter argument. 
---
Your statement that you were talking about the connotation of complex not the denotation (which would mean you were ignoring the definition btw) would hold some water if you hadn't said on multiple occasions that the vanilla trees were "objectively" more complex. If you are saying something fits the connotation of the words complex it cannot be objectively anything as connotations arent objective they will vary from person to person. This means that either A) you dont know what connotations are B) you dont know what objectively means or C) you are making up a new argument to justify your flawed argument. 
---
You still have provided me with no evidence for why vanilla trees should be considered more complex outside of the fact they have more points than BFA trees which as I have shown many times is not what complex means. If you can find me a definition of complex that supports your definition than I'll look at it but currently it's just your personal definition.
---
Just because you finish in the top 3 at your High School track meet doesn't mean you're ready for the Olympics.
---
Didn't read the comments on the other post but damn did people actually think he was serious xD
---
this was confirmed as not just visual. If you use the combatlog file you can clearly see the aimed/auto landing at the exact same time, when it should actually be delayed 0.5 sec. (had someone else test for me, can get the log if requested)
---
It doesn't, that's mostly a meme because the plaque (which only reads "Dedicated to those who died" or something) has or had a dialogue that went "Show me what happened" and the Lich King Bolvar cinematic plays.
---
Don’t forget about selling the daily arcanite transmute.

And up against a massive wall of ice.

You can do it if you really want to, but you won't start with it. You will start with mining and blacksmithing, level both to 300 on your way to 60, and then drop mining for engineering once you hit 60 and have some gold saved up.
---
The good thing about engineering is that you don't need to max it out to get the good stuff. 205 engineering lets you use sapper charges and iron grenades - and it's pretty cheap to get once you're level 60.
---
Similarly, you could mount on the boats if you walked to the very edge of the ropes hanging over the deck.
---
This is the kind of stuff they should've done instead of TBC.
---
Where do you get these banners? Seen a few posted on this sub so I’m assuming they aren’t one offs.
---
CoA and corruption, so they run out about the same time so you aint all the time reapplying 1 curse cast one other spell and again apply 1 curse etc.
---
Ghost bear from umm that forest zone in wrath. Also the spider from firelands. For a long time I used a wolf with the horde insignia on it. For it from some instance I don't remember.

Yeah, no offense to the Creator of that Site but the information seems to be 100% BS.
---
Nightstalker Claws (or maybe moonfang?) in Darkshore
---
I dont remember the quest item, but it was an alliance quest in ashenvale right near the darkshore border (kinda).  Two hours grinding to get it to finally drop.
---
I guarantee if Blizzard announced LFG and LFR in classic, those same exact people would come out of the woodwork and defend Blizzard to the death. Sharding used to the be the biggest thing people *did not want* in classic, and look what's happened...
---
The difference is what kind of attention you get.
---
&gt; 135k people subscribed to a sub that is an offshoot of the wow sub
---
so a niche community, much like the community of people who DEMANDED classic.
---
Nowhere else is this game talked about, just here and real wow sub, where you guys prop it up.
---
Sco INSTA rank 300 in fishing
---
move bitch, get out the way
---
This is great. I was just about to ask the sub if anyone had a compilation of their ganks. Amazing
---
Yo I don't have an answer for you but did Blizzard confirm they were making servers besides NA and EU?
---
And full of guards wearing black.
---
There are more wow players in Asia than there are in the US+EU combined. Why wouldn't they?
---
Man I would absolutely love an outcome like this or even just keeping the cap at 60 and bringing a more horizontal progression system with no LFD etc, but it’s more than likely just a pipe dream and nothing more. The chances of anything close to it happening are extremely low, but then so was classic itself so who knows.
---
Got mine on amazon, probably not the best quality, but it works!
---
Well done!
---
Ion publicly said that layering will not happen past phase 1. You dont, as a lawyer/public face, say "this absolutely will not happen" if theres even a chance of it happening. Lawyers word things carefully, and its part of why you shut the fuck up when the cops arrest you. So no, it will not be a permanent thing.
---
Ah - gotcha - i thought it was 3k people (both factions) per layer per continent.
---
Yea I mean I want to drop money on a standing desk just cant bring myself to do it because I'm a pincher
---
Yea that video is spot on, the damn wolves were so hard to kill on my rogue I died so many times doing a quest for them. The elites on private servers hit so freaking hard like 100 for a normal hit and crit for 200. Even though I had Cruel Barb elites would kill me before I could kill them. I remember in vanilla after getting Cruel Barb I could solo elites my level as a rogue.
---
Preparing to be down voted here, but that's a shitty tattoo. That linework looks like Michael J Fox did it, and the proportions are wrong.
---
I've got a few shitty ones too, so I'm not knocking ya for it, but that isn't good work. Either way, for the horde!
---
I'm aware man, but weapon skills in arms tree means going mace loses you 5% crit.. at a time when you only have 20%ish in those blues? you'd have to be insane to take that over the reaper, even for the effective 3% hit (which i had already mentioned).  
---
Demonshear may well be viable then, assuming your raid is happy for you to use it - I just know case examples where debuff slots from weapon procs are frowned upon. Depends how hardcore your guild is I suspect :)
---
I know those feels. I'm working up towards just a regular desk lol. I've been using a round kitchen table forever just cause it works and I already had one ):

Only time will tell, but I think it's gonna blow the roof off.  They got 3 generations of fans.

There are Taiwanese streamers on the beta. I don't see why they wouldn't. You can make an account on TW the same place in Battle.net as EU and NA.
---
And King Llane has dark blonde/light brown hair in Karazhan.
---
Mage has control, lulzy fire burst with good gear, food, tp, rogues have stealth, control, high damage....

I think I'd enjoy them both tbh.

Used to solo SM Armory as a MM hunter from level 37-44, xp was great aswell as gold.
---
Sida's *
---
Not if you're an elemental shaman. They've got a kit with an answer to nearly all the warlocks abilities, between purge, tremor totem, grounding totem, and earth shock.
---
Well, at that stage of leveling, grinding is actually a tad faster. So if you were actively killing trolls for the objective, its a win-win
---
Lots will probably get to 60 in 3-5 days /played, but I highly doubt 30-40 people from the same server will do it fast enough and have the minimal gear + coordination to get a group going so fast. Maybe 10 days is possible.
---
This is one good thing about streamers. When they exploit the layering problems they bring it into the spotlight. So if Blizzard doesn't fix this we know where classic is heading lol
---
The old record is 4 days 20 hours to 60, but there are more efficient routes and he didn't use any assistance. A lot of people have it under 3 days 18 hours using servers we now know are mostly correct thanks to the Beta.
---
Many guilds are planning week one Ragnaros kills.
---
Except that this isn't your "run of the mill" defense attorney. This is Activision Blizzard, emphasis on Activision.
---
The shareholders decide what happens, if removing layering means loss of money, it will be "postponed" regardless of what any employee said to us.
---
I agree that Holy Pallys were difficult to kill. I don't agree with *why*.    
---
Cleanse wasn't the problem. Cleanse doesn't even remove Curses, only Corruption/Immolate. The real issue was:    
---
  - Bubble    
---
  - Healing with almost no mana/Lay on Hands       
---
  - Shadow Resistance Aura     
---
  - Annoying stun    
---
If it was Ret or Prot you'd likely win. With a Holy Pally they just simply refuse to die, and you'll just lose the will to live and just let yourself die... The only good way to kill a Holy Pally was with really high burst, twice, but that means quite good gear and some luck. If it got dragged out you're screwed.
---
I remember getting 9 days played on my priest and thinking that was pretty great.

Hardcore guilds clear mc week 3

Super hardcore guilds clear mc week 2
---
Super duper hardcore guilds clear mc 1
---
I know that oceanic has been confirmed
---
good point
---
I mean its possible to get to 60 in about 7 days /played, but these guys forget that you still need to gear up 40 people to do MC. They are used to doing it on pservers which isnt the same thing. They are 'blizz like' in the description and are used to exp buffs and other things that make it a bit easier. The other thing they forget is you need to grind rep to even get to ragnaros. I wouldn't be surprised if they are able to down a boss or two in week 2, but they wont be clearing MC until probably about a month in.
---
Shame on me, thanks
---
7 days 14 hours is absolutely possible for some groups. We've got a team of ~120 people dedicated to getting 40 people in the raid in time to kill Ragnaros.
---
Thanks you very much :X
---
420 with full rested xp, gold loan etc which nobody would have.
---
It still isn't clear if things like spawn times were correct enough for the other records to be fully relevant.
---
Jeez, what a turbodouche
---
Group content PVE. Solo PVE (i.e. farming weekly mats, gold, etc) they aren't as great.
---
Hardcore will be within 2.5 wks maybe 2 for sure. Mega tryhards will have it down week 1 or say 8/9
---
Yeah I got the feeling stress test was less about testing and more about shoving people noses in the absolute shitfest that is starting zones.
---
That’s great and all, I’m so glad you have dark humor man. Just think for second that other people do not and it’s a topic that is really powerful.
---
We are raiding week 5. Gives everyone time to gear up and get to 60 :)
---
What are you on about?? It's using pins ingame and it's in the addon folder
---
To the contrary, I don't want to be waiting for a boar to spawn just to have it get tagged by a hunter for 3 fucking hours. Not really my cup of tea. Layer switching should be disabled in certain aspects though, such as within 50 yds of rare spawns and events. That should fix it. I also think it should be limited in numbers as well. like you can't just invite 39 other people and have them all spawn in your layer.
---
its a meme you dip

 **&lt;Lich Corp&gt; | Horde | PvP Server | Semi-Hardcore + PVP**
---
**Here are the basics...**
---
Lich Corp is a newly formed WoW Classic guild focused on building a mature, fair and fun environment. Our goal is to be a **Semi-Hardcore Raid Progression** guild focused on clearing content efficiently and fostering a helpful community for both new and returning players. The grind from character creation to your first KelThuzad kill will inevitably be a ceaseless slog, but we are inspired to build a wholesome WoW experience with like-minded players. We envision a tight-knit community, all having a sense of adult humor and respect.
---
**What makes us unique?**
---
It is 2019. Over the course of the last 15 years, new tools emerged allowing guilds to be more transparent, structured, and organized than ever before. Our unique **Multi-Factor Loot System** \- based on a mix of (i) EPGP Values, (ii) Loot Preference Rankings, and (iii) Rotating Loot Council - is designed to offer the most equitable loot distribution for our players. In addition, Raiders will be incentivized to participate in **PVP Campaigns** and **Casual Festivities**, which will diversify the game experience and benefit the guild. Lastly, we are aiming to optimize the WoW Classic experience by launching on a medium to high population server with **No Major Streamer Presence**.
---
**Raiders inspire the guild, but come with higher expectations.**
---
We are playing to win - we are beginning with an active search for **Raid Leaders** and **Core Raiders** to fill our ranks. Expect to have +80% attendance, be prepared with consumables, and understand raid mechanics. Lich Corp philosophy allows anyone with dedication and management skills to be promoted to leadership positions, strengthening the backbone of our guild.
---
**Raid Times**
---
6:30-9:30pm PST on Thursday / Friday
---
Reach out and let us have a conversation - message **RastaPasta52#6670** or **Arrexis#1397** to learn more.
---
No, the 4 day 20 hour record did not use rested XP or take any assistance from any player. Joana did it on a completely new Blizzard server.
---
We've been able to consistently hit 30 under 24 and 40 under 45 on the Beta using our Pserver routes. So unless our Pserver is just somehow more wrong for 40 to 60, we'll be able to get 60 in under 100 hours.
---
This is without the people constantly feeding us gold, potions, gear, etc. There's about 80 people dedicated just to getting the other 40 ready. We have one guy who's only goal is to get to level 25 and fish for Fire Protection Potions for the final push in MC.
---
Lol, Lawyers are literally paid to lie to people.
---
They weren’t.
---
At home in bed?
---
Just remember, you want to find places without casters and without enemies that can disable you from a range.
---
By normal means it's about twice as long, but he is killing only boars.
---
I stealth defended alliance towers several times on my rogue. Was great fun. Usually after Horde took the tower flag, they started looking outside from the tower ledge.bso they weren't watching the flag every second.
---
You could be mostly out if sight when flipping the flag back, thanks to those pillars. But you had to time it perfectly, when everyone looked away from the flag at the same time. Then you just hoped. Did it like 5 games in a row once, and it saved us because both sides started on the boss. But we were 1 tower ahead, so their boss was weaker.
---

Gurubashi arena.   World pvp.
---
If TBC becomes a thing, you can get 1.5sec shadowbolts  with a trinket/wep proc :D
---
you are completely ignoring or ignorant of the server ops side of things.
---
layering is basically load balancing with containers, to be very general.
---
the thing with containers is they are meant to be "stateless" in a sense of each other.
---
so sure it's technically possible to introduce state, but I bet as things are, there is no way of sharing your hash data across all containers/instances. 
---
and even if there were, doing this hash computation on every single node/chest/spawn is not efficient usage of cpu.
---
What are the multipliers if you lvl with a friend? Hmmm
---
I couldn’t get a layer shift on the stress test when I wanted it. Only ever got one when I didn’t and was mid fight.
---
Even grouped up and didn’t get shifted to the layer of the group.... was pretty disappointing.
---
Or just for zones under 20.
---
This is just wrong. We've done several 1 to 40 routes on the beta and they're almost identical to our own server's 1 to 40 routes. Very few things are different and we've been avoiding them completely. 60 in under 100 hours is absolutely possible.
---
We've also timed how long it will take to get 7 people the Quintessence for Ragnaros, it's about 6 hours.
---
A select group will have people playing the accounts 24/7, giving them ~2 days to farm gear.
---
Using a best guess of what gear we'll be able to get in time, we've consistently been able to clear MC with 30+ people.
---
We have a support staff of about 80 people with various jobs to make it happen.
---
And we know of several guilds with similar plans (one on our server that will be giving us Paladin buffs).
---
Week one Ragnaros kills will happen.
---
Its gonna be 3 layers per server if needed. And lets say max pop is 3.5k then theyll go to 5k players before layering kicks in.
---
At this point keeping layering past phase 2 would probably cost them more than removing.
---
He got bigger and stonger the more enemy players he killed. I remember a gigantic tree in the enemy base just destroying people.
---
Professions, just take a break from the grind once in a while and enjoy the world

Ay, newbie here preparing to roll an UD Warlock on a PvP server. Can anyone tell me why exactly warlocks are considered that strong? I get that fear is insanely strong but is that it? Just fear them if they try to get too close and damage them while they are running?
---
Nazjak is lv41, not that many people will farm him 1st week probably, I would expect some people to get it though.
---

Reduces the targets chance to resist is not the same as increasing your chance to hit.

---
We cleared both of those in under an hour each back in vanilla without world buffs and consumables. You don't need to spend hours outside of raiding hours to be efficient during raiding hours.
---
Best of luck to you then. Still won't think it will happen.
---
You can go look it up. :)
---
To be fair it's almost always way more nuanced than that. Every time I've seen these "defenders of layering/sharding" it's people just like you who are against it/disliking it but with the different opinion that it might be useful in the beginning.
---
Please stop exaggerating this into hyperbole and painting it as "this entire subreddit" because it couldn't be further from the truth.
---
Still better than Cataclysm
---
Why is Mara on the list ? Its a levelling dungeon.
---
I’ve heard so many different things on Lotus spawns so who knows. I heard that only 2 lotus spawns were ever up. I’ve heard 1 per zone max. I’ve heard they were on anywhere from a 60 minute to 12 hour spawn time. I have no idea and I’m not sure anyone else does either at this point.
---
His parody of Eminem's Rap God (warlock) from Legion was pretty good.
---
Gank. I'm rushing to 60 so that the sheer level advantage will let me gank players better than me that just leveled slower.
---
You make the mistake of assuming that changes have an immediate impact on the game's growth/success. There's a delay involved. The meta needs to settle. People need to wait and see if the new systems/content grows on them. Perhaps they'll come to enjoy it in time, and they've already invested years in their character.
---
Also, good and bad changes can cancel each other out in the growth charts. If everyone is hyped about fighting the Lich King, they're unlikely to quit, even if they don't like some of the other things the devs are doing. So good content patches mask the detrimental effects of other changes.
---
Nice bravado, Gernardo.
---
Wait, aren't the boars suppose to be way lower level? Like level 1 or something based on the episode?

---
where is this confirmed?
---
guilds that are no-lifing should have MC cleared in &lt;14 days.
---
not human = edge lord
---
Nice, that's pretty cool! Ill keep it in mind.
---
Just curious - roughly how different are your routes from joana's? Is it nearly the same with some optimizations or very very different?
---
I might set a goal for myself to try to beat the original joana record (tho obviously not as hard as you) if there is enough info online on what to improve since there is enough time to practice and i can probably at least get a loan for mount if needed.
---
Druids absolutely do not need engineering. You're almost always better off using a class ability than a grenade, and your DoTs will break the grenade stun anyway. Warlocks don't need it for a similar reason. Still nice to have on both classes - never know when you might get jumped while you're low on mana and a grenade might save you - but it's definitely not mandatory.
---
Pretty much every other class really wants engineering. Warriors, Rogues, Paladins really want grenades so they can do something from range. Shaman, Mages, and Priests want grenades to help them get off casts. Hunters are up there with Druids and Warlocks as classes that don't need engineering for the gadgets, but they still benefit from being able to craft their own ammo, so engineering has value for them.
---
No, not concerned one bit.
---
You just broke down that clip like a pro.
---
Hell ya. I see a fellow rogue doing it right
---
I never enjoyed leveling them and will likely leave my main proffession for 60 but thanks.
---
your spreadsheet link seems to confirm that melee leeway, if behaving correctly, should not trigger if one of the two players is walking. Therefore, there **is** a bug with how this is currently working on the beta, because slows &gt;29% (the threshold to trigger a walking animation) are NOT disabling leeway. This is what is causing various kiting methods to no longer allow players to trade 1-for-1 with a mob.
---
What’s your ttv
---
Without honor Id feel too much like Im wasting my time, otherwise totally.
---
I've killed Rag on pserver with a 25 man raid of people in mostly blues and greens and we were raiding in an off time on a dead (because pve) server. I've no doubt skill and prep would make it possible for fresh 60s with very minimal farming.
---
That said, this is the peak. There will be a long tail and you'll still see people entering MC for the first time months in.
---
I'll let you in on a secret.
---
nobody actually cared that you levelled unless you're hitting 60, and only say gratz/gz because they don't want to be rude.
---
Or they could lock you to one layer when you logg in. And lets say you have to be logged out for 30min for that lock to dissappear. (Same as if you dc on a full server you skip the queue to log back in).
---
Just 20 minutes ago you thought 7 days was a good time to 60.
---
I don't think your opinions beat our practice.
---
This calc bummed me out...
---
This sub is going to be nothing but “we need more layers” and “there’s too many people” when launch comes around. Everyone thinks because they took time off/are unemployed that they’re gonna shoot ahead of the pack and hit 60 in joana record times. Be happy blizz is thinking about these population issues while everyone is asking for them to happen!
---
What about not being able to layer hop unless you are in Org or Stormwind? Joining a group, doesn't matter, go back to the capital before going to the group leader location.
---
Then the system would still be load balancing on new logins. But you couldn't log out and back in to trick it, because it would remember you for a few minutes. You get the same layer you had, unless that layer no longer existed.
---
That changes a lot though, makes those items not as rare or special
---
That depends on alot of things. You have absolutely no idea how things will look at the start of phase 2, neither does Blizzard or anyone else. We can only "guesstimate" and so can Blizzard.
---
But keep in mind, Activision Blizzard has done alot of things in the past, solely to make more money and it has pisse the community off tons of times. They know people will still sub, even with layering implemented, if they can down key it enough.
---
I don’t see how. I simply told a story that relates to his.
---
I have one i just dont think im cut out for streaming haha so I wont bother anyone with it
---
Depends , some guilds will be hardcore but will allow time for guildies to hit 60 because they have jobs. But the raid requirements will be hardcore and other aspects of the guild will be hardcore. So you might see hardcore guilds not start raiding for a few weeks (my guild is planning to go hardcore but not going to kick members if they arent 60 in x amount of time). But once they do ding 60 they will be expected to be fully prepared.   
---
However, for guilds rushing all out to raid as soon as you can possibly manage, Id say theres a chance it can be done in week 1. Week 2 is pretty much gauranteed clear by those going in with a plan
---
Curse of tongues.
---
What do you suggest they do? people are upset, which i understand but what is another option?
---
Lol I must have triggered you. I wonder if you can say something clever to prove me wrong at least
---
Having to queue at the portal made people less likely to join battlegrounds, and those who did still had to hover around the area so they could requeue. 
---
Battlemasters changed nothing, just gave us a more useful place to duel spam next to.
---
This is where the implementation of melee leeway currently on beta is incorrect. Leeway should not apply when one of the players/mobs is walking. Slows &gt;29% cause the walking animation (or at least *should*). Currently on beta, hamstring, earthbind, concussive shot, ANY slow &gt;29% should be disabling melee leeway and **it is not**. 
---
**this is where the bug lies**.
---
what is dumb about ganking these cult of personality streamers exactly?

There's a gnome named Tyrion in Stormwind, I wondered if that was a reference when I first saw him.

Welcome to what being a shut in makes you
---
I'd for sure roll offspec in a leveling dungeon. If I'd play a paladin and the cruel barb dropped I'd roll. That is such a good weapon. Id use that and a shield. And 1-2 wipes is a lot for DM.

Longer between eating as a warrior. Also bis stat for PvP.

Just search for wow oldschool PvP songs on YouTube, there are several mixes there
---
Some of it is identical, some of it is completely changed. His 15 to 20 is not great. His 32 to 43 is just plain awful. And he spent almost 10 hours going from 58 to 59.
---
But his biggest weakness is refusing all groups and any other assistance. Just having various summoning teams at key points can save you double digit hours.
---
Always thought female orcs looked like more proportionate human males, except you know... with boobs

Devaluing things is not the solution... kind of goes against vanilla in general.

I’m glad people like you don’t make the decisions.

PvP over Lotuses/Devilsaurs works the same way too.

What was so bad about two zones worth of phasing again?
---
Imagine 3 fishing competitions every week.   3 instances of separate NPCs.  
---
Also, world buffs will have 3 instances of being turned in as well.
---
(If this is a troll, you got me.)
---
&gt; the thing with containers is they are meant to be "stateless" in a sense of each other.
---
This doesn't make sense. States don't matter in this context - unless you mean the state being 'layer activated' and 'layer not activated'. It sounds like you're just flinging around buzzwords.
---
&gt; but I bet as things are, there is no way of sharing your hash data across all containers/instances. 
---
This doesn't make sense. One server is a collection of layers. All layers are aware of what 'server' they are in. Like, by definition. I would understand your confusion if this was phasing (where servers are not taken into account). But in Layering the server is explicit for every layer.
---
&gt; doing this hash computation on every single node/chest/spawn is not efficient usage of cpu.
---
This doesn't make sense. A hash is pants easy to compute. And the size of a md5 hash is 16 bytes. (For the layman, google hashrate for bitcoin and you can see what consumer-grade tech can handle. millions a second.

Remindme! 3 months

Sadly in Bulgaria young people think this is heroic or something. It's stupid.

Esfand is not in method pretty sure thats a joke.

This gives me so much joy.

&gt; It's 8-11 days played unless you're a pro.
---
Eh...8-11 maybe for a player looking to experience the world in full. Even a scrub could probably level any class in 7 days just by following Joana's guide.
---
Awesome work. Have followed for support!
---
You will with addons.

Nothing official. One would hope they open the flood gates a bit for AV testing - but I reckon that'd be separate from the Beta.
---
It sounds like a potential game killer..

[Just play on the server where all streamers will be driven off](https://redd.it/by3nd0).
---
did he report it?
---
Was honestly the single best PvP experience in any video game ever made. I'm talking about the true AV 1.0 with the huge wings to the sides of the map with PvE bosses, vendors with landmines, battles of the forest god and the ice god, ram riders, wolf riders, wing commanders, upgrading your troops armor and weapons...fucking hell it was like you were smack in the middle of a giant Warcraft 3 match.
---
Karazhan and the heroic 5 mans (of TBC in particular).  Class balance being an extreme bonus.  
---
I also loved outlands in general.  Also found a lot more fun in questing for some reason; they had a lot more special moments and big lead ups than vanilla did.
---
Also, I miss the attunement chains with a passion.
---
it doesnt make sense because  you don't deal in server operations.
---
your ego is dangerously big for being a junior dev
---
Play what you want. On whatever server you want. Worry less about what a streamer is doing.
---
That seems like a good solution
---
Seduce soulfire fear dot fear conflag shadowburn?
---
Totally. I wasn't being facetious.
---
no layering, more servers like the old days. They got $$$ they are just being greedy
---
I mean for some people they might say that ms is fine but.. as someone who plays league and stuff at like 30 ms.. I would play pservers at 100ish and I could deff feel it. If you wanna normal pvp I would say it's not too bad (you deff feel the ms less in classic) but if you wanna play reaction based I would say the 9ms is... prime
---
depends what class you are and what class you duo with and if you plan on being ahead of the pack or not. theres a lot of variables
---
Im afraid to that on prt most streamers went horde together with their audience . I dont know if they will switch when classic comes live.
---
## Come all ye Mages &amp; Paladins, help me choose!
---
📷
---
Looking for a perspective from people who have played Paladin and Mage in Vanilla.
---
So  I've mained a Paladin since TBC. I find it really fun, but would also  like to try Mage since it's the only alt class that I've leveled in  Retail that I really enjoyed.
---
I  play mostly pvp/wpvp (including SS/TM &amp; AV). Which of the two  classes do you guys think would be more fun for a solo player, who only  is able to play a couple of hours a day?
---
\*\**Also, I'm aware that if I choose Paladin that I will be a heal bot, which I'm fine with.*
---
discord *mod*
---
Yea, 2.3 was a huge slap in the face to people who cleared t5 pre nerf as well.  Honestly, the first year of TBC is what shined the brightest.
---
Not to mention the complete devaluing of those who cleared T5 pre nerf.  What a slap in the face that was to so many people at the time.
---
Alliance: sexy elf ladies
---
Horde: sexy undead elf lady
---
Nope bad idea. So what happens when a layer has 1 person and another layer has 50 all trying to do 5 quests. The layering is there to make it less painful.
---
eww
---
You think you do, but you don't.
---
I used to prey on tagged players inside the AH as a female Undead rogue, back before most realized they had a god damn backflip special attack animation!
---
For PvP, CoA first is generally the way to go as it does significantly more damage, never know when you'll get CC'd so it's best to get that out and ticking immediately and it's the most damage you can get for that global.  You could easily go an entire fight without nightfall procs so I don't fight around it.
---
I only suggest Corruption first again targets that can self decurse.
---
Now this is high quality content
---
Really? Can't say I agree there, but it will really make doing stuff out in the world feel extremely risky and less appealing.
---
Just needs a couple more iterations.
---
Why would they have to move to NA?
---
i think so
---
The problem was with the post 2.3 badge gear, not the entry level ones. 
---
They eventually let you completely skip karazhan, which was a massive mistake imo...  Especially since they had put in ZA anyway which let you skip T5 content.  So you could normally (as a newcomer) raid karazhan for your gear (not even needing gruul or magtheridon), then go straight into ZA, and be raid ready for BT/hyjal. 
---
But noooooo.... they just had to slap in badge gear that essentially gave you T5 quality gear as well.  It was a massive slap in the face at the time that only led into worse crap like the sunwell dailies... basically paving the path into wrath daily grinds and badge gear improving every single content patch to the point of devaluing the first tier the moment the next one came out.
---
Uhh... ill take a stab. Insignia of the Alliance (Its a NE!). Band of Sulfuras or Bloodclot Band, the mana regen ring from DME last boss, Cenarion/Stormrage Boots, Abyssal Leather Leggings of Restoration, Cenarion/Stormrage Belt, Stormrage Gloves, those leather 22 healing bracers, that DME chest with SP, Stormpike Sage's Cloak, Cenarion/Stormrage Spaulders or Wild Growth Spaulders, that MC neck with SP power on it, Cenarion/Stormrage Helm and the Rejuv Idol. Dunno about weapon or second trinket.
---
&gt; Spells in PvP now have a slight increase in range and area of effect when targets are moving. This should improve the overall usability of spells and ranged attacks
---
I'm pretty sure that's ranged spells (+aimed/multi shot) still hitting if the target moves 1-2 yards out of the max range. You can't start the spell but it will still finish casting.
---
&gt;*To "****right****-****click****" on an* ***iPhone****, tap your screen as you would normally, but leave your finger in place for a full second. Try it out on a Web link in* ***Safari****. If performed correctly, a menu of options pops up instead of the browser following the link.*
---
This is what I found out from Google. I don't have iPhone so I can't test it. You could also try right click to another website to see if it works.
---
Like it should be. This shouldn't even be something we have to have a conversation about! I get the more servers argument but WHO CARES that STV is a shit show... That's WHAT MOST OF US WANT.
---
Well what happened was that they still had people needing to clear karazhan (as newcomers), and then after getting kz geared, you could skip T5 raids entirely and go straight into ZA for T5 equivs.  The mix of KZ and ZA gear allowed you to be BT/Hyjal raid ready, easily. 
---
The problem is that they then also added in badge gear that was on level with T5 to further add salt to the wound and make raiding previous content all the more pointless. 
---
T5, arguably the most challenging and interesting fights we've seen to date, were completely devalued in 1-2 patches.  Attunements scrapped, the need to raid anything pre t6 scrapped, and they left people with only titles that no one ever gave a crap about even to this frickin day.  
---
Yea, it was a bad time in TBC.  Still loved the first year of it though.. I would gladly replay TBC despite knowing what crap would go down.. just to experience that pure joy one last time.
---
Only allow layers in uncontested zones
---
Theres always been a faction imbalance. When vanilla launched and first numbers were released, Alliance (*cough* scum) outnumbered Horde almost 3:1. It's impossible to get the faction numbers to marry up, and rightly so. Play whichever faction you want, because regardless of numbers the game still worked and people got to experience all of it. Wouldn't let it worry you.
---
Its originally from Brahm Stocker's Dracula right?
---
Gnomes won’t be in Phase 1.
---
I can't wait to see 3 fishing competitions taking place at once and having 3 winners every week, further devaluing in game accomplishments and goals.
---
Also, world buff turn ins will have 3 instances.
---
Staff looks like the AB exalted staff, Ironbark Staff.
---
Trinkets are PVP trinket and Shadow Reflector.
---
They would have to open them fairly soon so players can level for AV testing. I don’t think there will be any more waves of invites other than perhaps 1 more small friends and family.
---
yeah but k3 is fucked lol, have seen BL at 175.
---
Guarantee this will be in at launch and abused on every server.
---
PM me for some resources and access to speedrunning communities for your preparation. Also, just to warn you: this probably is not going to happen in any reasonable amount of time unless you practice your route on a private server or the beta before launch. With how little time you have to play at the moment, I’d suggest you start this preparation much sooner than “closer to launch,” whenever that is, as you mentioned in the video. I’m cheering for you and would love to assist with the prep! You are not alone. There are literally dozens of us speedrunners!
---
nO NeEd To bE rUdE!
---
I've tried, and either I'm doing it wrong or it's not a thing. TBH I don't think I would do it often, even if I could, because it would be so mana inefficient. Would probably be different in BC if I was a Blood elf doing Seal of Blood and Seal of Command.

[Druid PvP set](https://classicdb.ch/?itemset=551), [WSG Pants](https://classicdb.ch/?item=22752), [Bracers](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19595) and [Ring](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19522) and [AB Staff](https://classicdb.ch/?item=20069). [Neck](https://classicdb.ch/?item=17109) might be from Lucifron. PvP trinket and [Shadow Reflector](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18639). The cloak icon is one of the most commonly used, but given that the rest of the gear is PvP vendor stuff, [Battle Healer's Cloak](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19526) fits the icon, but it's horde version of WSG rewards and the druid is using Alliance PvP trinket.
---
Layering will Only kick in when the server with lets say 3.5k pop reaches 5k.
---
But thought about and if you and a friend gets locked on different layers its not good either.
---
I really dig the art style.  Can see all the little cracks and stuff makes it so much better.
---
Both should be great in world pvp and pve. I think sm ruin works in both pve and pvp as warlock, not sure about mage specs. As a warlock you might have an easier time getting a raidspot, since everybody and their grandmothers seem to be rolling mages. Dont forget to go horde if you go for warlock, will of the forsaken is a motherfucker.
---
You don't need to level for it you get a lvl 58 char.
---
That seems like a really good guess. I recognized the MC necklace.
---
Posts like these are to attempt to turn their “consideration” into a “yes!”

In this case, he isn't interpreting 'casual' as low play hours, he's interpreting it as low-EFFORT play hours. Not pushing M+ or Mythic raiding, organised hard content, but lots of low-focus grindy collectables and low-effort quests.
---
Casual is often interpreting as 'a few hours per week', but that's rarely what people are referring to when they say the game has become more casual - they mean it takes very low effort to do the basic shit and isn't rewarding because there's no reason for people to reach out and stretch themselves to achieve and see content.
---
Chuck Norris speaks Russian in French
---
Youre right about the shadow reflector, but AB exalted staff has a purple glow doesnt it? not the icon, but the actual model, which is the one thing we can actually see in the pic.
---
Yea, it might happen at first... in deadmines and wailing caverns.
---
Then people will know lol... it isn't going to bleed over into most of the game.  Those players will either quit after making the realization or they will adjust.. just like we all did back when WoW came out to begin with.
---
what a fucking annoying autist
---
the cooldown is longer ;)
---
In a real world where there is a possibility of having millions of players connecting to compute instances which are not designed to handle that many players. The tech guy in me gets it the gamer in me dislikes it, though overall if it's just a few weeks of our multi year gaming experience I think it will be forgotten rather quickly.
---
Flying makes the world opt-in. It’s a huge convenience feature, but it doesn’t improve the actual gameplay.
---
Back in vanilla, I did kinda the same thing. After reaching level 60, I went to every town/outpost and talked to every NPC I could to make sure there wasn’t any quest I didn’t do. 
---
At the same time, I used a thottbot (what everyone used pre-wowhead) and wowhead to look up NPCs and quests by zone to make sure I didn’t miss anything as well, like a NPC in the middle of nowhere. 
---
Can’t be 100% sure, but if pretty confident by the time TBC was out, I had done every quest available to me.
---
You want Blizzard to limit someone else's playtime based on a number decided by... You?
---
If someone decided that you were under curfew, had to be indoors and at 6pm, that would also be controlling.
---
"I'd rather spend 10 hours making it from level 1 to 2 so that there isn't a miniscule chance some autist streamer will get an advantage from one of his followers"

lmao ridiculous

Leveling as a Paly in PS I’ve had to put myself out there a bit more in chat whereas being Priest back in the day I’d often get random w/
---
Fucking hell you guys are killing me ! This thread alone is better then entire current wow.
---
I think it refers to both.
---
Stolen Silver quest. We all know why.
---
Yeah I am aware, but with how they’ve handled testing in the past WSG,Arathi Basin how often did they open waves and allow even a limited access. 
---
They have enough content creators currently in the beta to test AV. They most likely will not be opening limited access. 
---
I truly wish they would for nothing more than to test the BG stability with multiple concurrent sessions happening. But sadly not getting my hopes up.
---
Ah, so this is the key thing. You gotta have tryhard, coordinated friends to get such a fast run.
---
I don't even have regular friends.
---
&gt; I don't want to be waiting for a boar to spawn just to have it get tagged by a hunter for 3 fucking hours. Not really my cup of tea.
---
They have a version of WoW for you that is available to play right now.
---
You're never going to use slam tanking.    
---
      
---
If it's a dungeon and you have imp OP you probably want to switch to hit OP - mitigation is rarely a huge issue in 5 mans and a nice OP crit will probably be the best use of your rage for both threat and damage on a single target.  
---
Yes the general idea in a raid is revenge -&gt; sunder -&gt; heroic strike for dump. Shield block and shield slam both depend on how much rage you're getting and how worried you are about mitigation. In general you do want to use shield block on CD and you do want to slam if it's not going to rage starve you (not worth missing revenges or dropping sunder stacks for).
---
Why do you americans always have the need to share this kind of drama on the internet. keep it for yourself, nobody comes hear to read this kind of shit.
---
pvp gear also in classic
---
You make it sound like this crap wasn't already known back then... Vanilla players know warriors weren't all around gods, but the issue stemmed from AQ40/naxx40 geared warriors 2 shotting everyone in sight, and back then so few people even had BWL gear to contest it.
---
That's a great way to have totally dead servers a couple months after launch
---
Shade of Modgud? Skardyn Warlord? An undead red dragon? A Dragonmaw chieftain?
---
You always do damage, just that not talented and usually with +healing instead of +spellpower gear. Open world mobs will die anyway but you won't be an efficient mob farmer anyway. HPala is bit different in that he can farm undead (WPL, EPL). Gathering won't be impacted that much. Even in high level zones you have a mount to navigate around or away from mobs, while on lower level their aggro range will be decreased up to aggro only on direct contact (like Ruins of Alterac is full of elite ogres but they won't aggro if you won't contact with their hit boxes.
---
Lmao you again. Figured you would be out on your little private server farming a life
---
I mean, the way it's described is a very high level.  
---
A basic implementation would be pooling objects (black lotus) into a list, this list is duplicated on each layer. When a player accesses this list element (e.g. black lotus in winterspring) they cannot access the same list element in another layer.  
---
All attributes of the list element are independent of the actual list itself.
---
I feel like his Strength/Agi is REALLY low for the PvP set though, looks more like Cenarion/Stormrage to me based on that.
---
You way overestimate how many people are going to actually prepare for launch. On any given server, maybe 10% of the players are going to be using a route like Joana’s. This is not going to be like pserver F R E S H.
---
Overpower procs no matter what stance, you just need to quickly dance to battle to use it. I tended to have a /cast Battle stance macro binded to the same button as overpower when in berserker.
---
Awesome! I do plan on getting imp OP. Is there a reason to OP it in dungeons and not raids?
---
Both combos had a place but more seduce to fear though
---
r u dum tho
---
If you don't farm then you gather. Plus you can make your own consumes. And even if classes can farm-generate gold they still need to buy goods with it or it's worthless so at the end there must be people creating those goods :)
---
Ty! Good to know!
---
Highly suggest you keep your fingers out of other peoples business and avoid trying to control the legal actions of people you don't know, will make the world a better place.
---
sort of.  Your tier 1 set bonuses are quite good, but a lot of the gear itself has medicore stats.  Tier 2 is mostly crap, and the set bonuses laughably useless, aside from the 1st.  You will use the t2 3 pc and the full t2.5 together for a chain heal set.  Then t3 is used for single target healing.
---
Idk how people stomach him. I can't listen for more than 1 minute. I'm just watching all of madseasonshow and catching highlights. The guy from Method seems pretty easy to watch from the clips I've seen.
---
then just have a few, 15k servers. Pserver are doing just fine as is with 15k peak
---
Mate i have tested this. The best i can get if they dont have Oceanic servers is if you get onto a West coast server. 302ms ave.
---
I do think that they will have Oceanic servers though.  there is a map of Classic release times and it appears that the map collocates to Server Farm locations.
---
I like that, I'm taking a week off work to no life but still think i won't be close to 60 with pre raid BiS
---
One day you’ll learn how to keep connections and quit simultaneously. Don’t worry.
---
+30 SP enchant should make it glow yellow if I'm not mistaken
---
It was absolutely brutal for me on the pserver I'm on.  And yes, I am a LOT better than I was then.
---
Who are all the sweet looking fuck boys at the start?
---
Really like it. IMO the RedRidge Highway should go to this zone though I never really understood why it was needed before. This would be a good place for it to go to.
---
How do we even know this is the Ooga Gang? Is there any footage that isn't from public streams that was already in a compilation?

Do you mean that the monsters gain haste from your parry or theirs?

Thanks, I hate it.

Brilliant! I love it, just like the "Wildhammer Highlands" map!
---
After ~2k hours playing rdruid in a top guild on K1, personally I've thought the whole "no-res" thing to be blown out of proportion. Definitely not enough of an issue to want to pick a different class.
---
While there'll be many new and inexperienced players, I've found wiping in dungeon groups to be a hell of a lot more uncommon than it was in retail vanilla. People these days tend to play more efficiently and be less picky about their healer class. Not to mention in many groups you can b-res another res class if you need to, like the other commenter said.
---
Druid is a very fun class to heal with, and you should consider it! Resto can be amazing for chain pulling in dungeons, and are definitely viable through all tiers of raid content. The quality of life beats out a lot of other classes too.
---
Take my experience with a grain of salt, because it is on private servers, but there are some areas that terrify me.
---
Ban'ethil barrow dens is one of them.
---
https://twitch.tv/themechanic98/
---
And there's a guy on YouTube called "Traque" https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkLpIXTAPu9Wm_Xcph02Slg
---
I think weapons keep their own glow if they have one though no? I remember my Halberd of Smiting on my Paladin was always red even with Crusader on it.
---
What a total flog. Dictating the rules of the game like he is in charge. I would totally join that Guild. I hate streamers tbh.
---
Got married first - good call
---
What I've learned from launch days of different games I am expecting there will be some kind of problems. Usually launches just don't go as planned and things get more better after day or two. Sure if you can and want to get days off go ahead. I would do it if I could. But remember there is possibility that everything goes wrong on day 1 and you can't play the game very well.
---
The servers are absolutely designed to handle the number of players that are spread across the layers within the server. The only point to the layering is to prevent overpopulation from a player perspective. When the server fills up on all layers it simply starts a login queue like high pop server players are used to.
---
I'm not even sure the fish at Jarods Landing are worth XP.
---
Shadow focus works like spell hit talents.  It’s a little confusing but technically two points is fine, but that leaves you with one more point to spend before you unlock the next tier.
---
In raids generally your dps just doesn't matter that much, 90% of the time the danger is dying so taking 10% more damage isn't worth the very minor boost in damage and threat in a raid setting. As a noobie just sit in defensive and spam revenge/sunder/block and focus on pulls and positioning. Once you are comfortable with that and get a good feel for it you can start worrying about your dps/max TPS etc but don't worry about it to start with.
---
A few people working that hard and organized to pull off abuse vs 5000 people waiting hours to finish their first quest. 
---
While I get that the community should press them on removing this ASAP I don’t agree with shaming them for saying they want this tech in for the first few weeks
---
Must of got that in the stockades by a orc with fat fingers lol
---
It’s super incorrect for a number of reasons, foremost of which is that this is an equation more complex than a 4-element form can handle. Also, mage is rated “medium-fast”? Riiiiiiiight....
---
I hope this is fixed before release
---
There's a web site with gold for sale already, for 1$ per G on wow Classic servers
---
priest should work better with one spec. In pvp shamans go ele/resto  which will be less useful in raids(no manatide totem). The best pvp specc for priest healing was 33/18/0  I believe, should work fine in pve.
---
Atm we have to go to Sweden to get some even slightly ’real’ tacos :( maybe one day!
---
Some items get enchant glow effects that mix with/go over their initial, like Ardent Avenger (blue sword) becoming a [discount Teebu's](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/6265-argent-avenger-enchanted-with-demonslaying-for-extra-bling-factor.jpg) if you put Demonslaying on it.
---
Besides, we'd have a hard time finding another item that fits considering it's the same icon and model as Ironbark Staff.
---
Great combination! Gl dude
---
I N S U F F E R A B LE
---
exactly... this is why this was only going to work to the starting zone and no further, as stated by them before. But ofc they backpaddeled and now it's for the starting weeks, then phase 1 tops.
---
Layering should be restricted to the 1st zone where you level from 1-10 before you start considering moving to your second area and up to 2 weeks after release.
---
https://www.twitch.tv/fotmxd doesn't stream much but has played a very good hunter on p servers for years
---
Or maybe it's a good idea (it absolutely is) which isn't working as intended yet.
---
Layering, as they outlined they'd like it to work, is the best solution anyone has come up with to compromise between launch experience/population/queues and post-launch healthy populations without needing manual server merges or free transfers.
---
If working as intended, it should create *stronger* communities, and not be exploitable.
---
I very much hope they don't give up (with the caveat that if they somehow can't stop it being exploitable, then they give up).
---
Maybe if you are incredibly incredibly slow at leveling. Any player with that kind of scheduling crisis who is committed to the idea of raiding will do at least *some* route preparation to ensure that they can hit a decent (6-8days played) time.
---
But how old were you?
---
Or Asian servers...
---
Pearl Diving had to be the worst but aleast you can buy blue pearls but there's never any on the AH lol
---
Probably but we don't know yet. More than likely won't find out to 2 weeks before with name reservations.
---
22 at launch.  23 when I hit 60.

I mean, if it's "less appealing" to play during the initial rush, it could be devastating to the game's potential.

Clearly you’re preparing to light that banner on fire secretly revealing the glorious horde banner in all of its glory.

Ah, the duality of Bean.

Honestly I see 1 button rotations for mage as an advantage, and a reason I’m rolling one. But that’s just me
---
Die.
---
The quests for each class was progressively added throughout vanilla over several patches.
---
The power of the items depend enormously on the class so hard to tell when the optimal phase to release them.
---
I played a shaman back in retail vanilla and the trinket we got is BiS from the moment you get until TBC.
---
The trinket works like a empowered mana spring totem so it benefits from anything in the game that buffed mana spring.
---
So before the Devs hit us with the shaman "revamp," in 1.11 and we countered with bus shock it would last for 34 seconds since we used to have a talent called eventide that increased the duration of mana spring for 10 sec. 
---
So at its peak that lowly level 50 trinket averaged out to 16 mp/5... To each person in the group :) 
---
Or the equivalent of giving 4 healers an extra shard of the scale.
---
i've set up a personal p server and explored a lot between the zones. There's a ton of room honestly, they could add lots of stuff or easily expand existing zones.
---
As long as you use auto-loot, you don’t have to wait for the loot. Just click and keep running. The items will be looted.
---
east of the burning steppes, one of the unlabelled inaccesible zones
---
I believe that Sharm still makes WoW songs. She made a cover of Jainas Song, that’s amazing￼

What happens when a friend or guildy isn't on the same layer and you want to run a dungeon/quest together?
---
east of burning steppes
---
In case you are not trolling - dwarf for fear ward.
---
While somewhat true, you have to be prepared to constantly deal with rogues popping on you, and that is the one class that is not only a bitch to fight, but can own you regularly. They prioritize locks, as they should. Better hope that deathcoil is off CD.
---
Blizz wont release a game that is unplayable at start.
---
Hmm. Well, chalk it up to the wonder of exploration and a lack of reasons to rush, then. I think going back in with your knowledge, even if you haven’t played since then, will net you a 10d time if you even remotely attempt to stay focused. 10d /played is a **lot** of wiggle room for bullshittery.
---
Is there anywhere to buy accounts that have access? Couldn’t easily find anything.
---
Ooh, maybe this is an attempt to limit switching layers to major cities. Would be good for all the weird bugs and exploits we've seen and anticipated.
---
I'm not saying layering is good or bad, but I fail to understand how layering is anything but bad for the devilsaur mafia? The issue with the mafia is that they are the only sellers or devilsaur leather/items and guard these dinosaurs, and layering will only make it harder for them to maintain that monopoly.
---
I have a job and I need to do my own chores in the household etc., so that leaves 4 hours a day tops. Sure, I could go for 10 hours each day on the weekends, but I like to have a little rest day now and again.
---
Maybe I'm in the minority then, I would have guessed the majority would be older like me and have obligations that limit their free time.
---
It’s not that I’m worried about what a stream is doing is more that I’m worried alliance will be outnumbered 3:1 in every instance of world pvp lol

Just be a streamer

I try to look at his bravado as satire. Makes the metaphorical medicine go down easier.
---
stream man bad
---
ooga good, mon
---
Lol, you dont need prebis and flasks to kill ragnaros. Most of the guys can be levelup greens with some consumables and possibly a fire resistance buff from BRS for ragnaros pull. Just have to use wheelchair tactics, cant go nuts on aoe. 
---
The thing you have to do is have certain ppl grind enough rep to get the douse quest, do those bosses, return the q, get the douses and maybe few summons to get restocked on douses (if you dont have enough ppl that got the douse q done).
---
I know guild im in is planning going for first reset MC, i didnt sing up for it because playing a shammy with a warrior friend and we plan on SLEEPING too :). So in all likelihood not going to get to high enough level for MC. But who knows, theres a new meta in levelup that might make it faster.
---
I would be cool with Vanilla releasing expansions like this that don't raise the level cap or add anything that takes away from the Vanilla feel but adds zones and dungeons like this to keep the gameplay fresh.
---
Sounds like a familiar plan.
---
I’m trying to make everything I eat beforehand so I can just heat it up. I’m fishing a lot and gathering a lot of stuff from nature and the diet will focus a lot around them. Eating fish at least once a day, having a good dose of berries every now and then etc. It’ll be fun making the food prep during the summer and once I’m eating it, it’ll hopefully bring some memories and get my mind off leveling for a short while :D 
---
Working out during every short pause sounds wise aswell! I’m going to get a schedule from a  physiotherapist friend of mine to ensure the good enough balance. I also plan to have a massagist comint to me every two days.
---
But gl to you aswell! Hope you’ll enjoy the ride
---
Ah, That's a pretty cool addon actually yeah. I just assumed it was a private server because of the name. My apologies for that.
---
The subtle Jurassic Park music was perfect.
---
TILL I DIE! ...oh wait
---
Battle Stance has 0.8 base threat modifier. Defensive has 1.3. 
---
Revenge and overpower share a cooldown.
---
Is your goal max damage or max threat? If your revenge is coming up fairly often then it might actually cause more threat than an overpower. Plus you're spending time switching between stances to do overpower.
---
Whirlwind is nice in that it hits 4 enemies. But spamming battle shout (assuming your party members are close enough to be buffed by it) is actually really good threat if it is modified 1.3 by def stance. I don't have the numbers to hand but I believe it's comparable or better to whirlwind (assuming a 1h weapon equipped).
---
Let me translate this: "These games are dead or dying because I don't play or care about them anymore"
---
Honestly I don't know why the hell they changed it so many times. It never got played more or less with any of the changes they made and all they accomplished was making it basically no different from every other damn BG in the game. A guaranteed 15 minute or less experience where nothing terribly memorable ever happens.
---
Why can't we have one or two BGs that are radically different? Why can't there maybe even be a separate queue for something like Wargrounds that are designed to take multiple days, but reward players as they contribute?
---
They are two posts literally one after the other.

You copy pasted the same thing into both threads.

---
Awesome, thanks!
---
Yo Blizzard. hire this guy,
---
Thanks for your insight! I hope so!
---
Dude seriously. You’re so damn dramatic
---
I know it's not what you want to hear, but if you play for 16hrs a day and level to 60 in 120hrs the difference between not going outside and taking 30 minutes to sit in the sunshine and relax for 30 minutes everyday is ding at mid day after the first reset or dinging at 2:30pm.
---
Taking a break and using that time wisely, like getting some air means you will be less fatigued, play better, make fewer mistakes and have more fun. Imo anyway.
---
There is a reason, despite racing for wf, that high end guild take breaks regularly. The human brain isn't designed to do something without interruption for that long.
---
https://www.fastcompany.com/40475204/youre-taking-breaks-the-wrong-way-heres-how-to-fix-that
---
I'm actually fine with that as long as it's not NA only.
---
I wouldn’t say succesful, just a life which looks a bit like me. :D
---
I really do hope so bud.
---
You really answered your own question: a holy paladin isn't great at solo pvp.
---
heh?
---
&gt;6 or 7k... that's more than double the pop of vanilla servers,
---
The  higher the pop the better the game is. More people in every zone, thus the world feels more alive. More dungeon groups being formed, more raiding guilds to chose from (as oppose to 1-3 per server), more world pvp and more fun overall.
---
I'd say somewhere between 10-15k per server is ideal.
---
Blizzard should just have dedicated "very low" populated servers where people can wear rose tinted glasses on their ghost-town servers.
---
It's been talking about quite a bit in the ret pala discord, I think the general consensus is that life steal procs scale a little bit with SP, but other procs like fire/shadow or nature  damage does not.
---
Remember when hunter pets didn’t shrink like some damn soft dicks once you tamed them? Some actually stayed their actual size.
---
Layering needs to go after the first 2 weeks, otherwise it will gut the game too much.
---
YOU CANT ENJOY WHAT I DONT HOW CAN YOU KIKE KIDDDIE STUFF
---
Wtf dude lmao.  I'm dreading running into negative people like this in  game.
---
Yeah I have some experience of this and going quite casual I’ve made it in 6,5 days. Tho of course private servers are what they are but I’m quite positive I can do it in 6 days or less
---
Yeah thought about that too and that would be a bad thing
---
You mean first alliance guild that has 30x L60's and some L55+'s will get "world first".
---
Druid v Priest
---
* I'm gonna be playing real casual so I'd like to have a smooth(ish) leveling experience. Both classes are steady levellers, with Druid on top I guess. Both are quite tanky (Priest esp. with Shadowform).
---
* Whilst levelling both will be pretty easy to find dungeon groups. Do Druids often get invited to tank stuff pre-60? And are they capable of healing dungeons with some int gear and a feral spec?
---
* Looking to play healing in endgame. Are Druids viable dungeon healers at 60 (as only healer in the group)? I imagine Priests getting easier into groups.
---
* Druids will be geared fast if they can into raids. Are their tier sets any good?
---
* What are the main differences in raid healing for Druid vs Priest? (Is Druid just HT rnk. 4 spam?)
---
Oh thanks! &lt;3
---
“Good” in the speedrunning community for 1-30 is around 20-25hrs depending on the class. 1-40 would be in the 35-40 range. 
---
For someone not speedrunning, but at least somewhat attempting to stay on task, I’d say 1-30 would take avg 35-40 hours and 1-40 avg 50-60 hours. 
---
Now, this is the classic beta, and the point was to test. To reimmerse. Not to aim for speed. So slower times make total sense. No rush when there’s a level cap in place :)
---
Literally giving out Ice barbed spear and that mage wand for free.
---
Hes sponsored by Method. Nothing to do with being in their guild.
---
What a great idea!! I have to come up with something
---
Theirs. If you swing and a monster parries, their current swing timer is reduced by 40%, to a minimum of 20% of the remaining swing timer.
---
will do, but I think you are over thinking it.
---
I am a speed leveler and this will be my 5th or 6th time doing this.
---
done it 4-5 times already in the Pserver scene. Only different, I ate like shit during those times - hard to beat papa johns buy 1 get 1 free or 40% off menu deals. 2 extra large pizza lasted me 4 days for $20 was hard to beat. 
---
taking 9 days off.
---
my best time IN GAME was 4 days 19 hour, so rounding up, 5 days or 120 hours divide that by 18 hours per day = 6 playing days. 
---
May be 7 days depending what time the server goes live and how long I've been awake already.
---
I dont think you understand the point of wow. It's great you have a life and a girlfriend I guess. And you are busy.
---
Wow offers that feeling of success and achievement and the dopamine rush. And it feels real because it is real. You can be proud of yourself and stoked to continue something like wow. I have got that from other games but it's a game I was mediocre at and it was easy to do and didnt mean nearly as much. 
---
Real life is fuckin m3h imo. Some people have better lives and are living them the way they want to. That's great. My life is kind of shit right now and I want to play wow.
---
Thanks for the tip, really good idea!
---
Yeah, but you can mitigate it by not grouping up with random people outside and focusing on dungeons.
---
But yeah, that's my fear. If someone layer-shifts twice in an hour in a huge cave and keeps dying they're gonna get a bit salty.
---
I get why we need layering for launch, it makes sense...what doesn't make sense however, is why it needs to be around beyond early zones. why not just stop it when players reach contested zones? that should be enough time to weed out tourists and for players to spread out a bit, why have it just going for an entire phase?
---
they see me roll on my dreadsteed...

I think you seriously underestimate just how fucked the launch window would be with few servers and no layering. Thousands of characters all in the same few start zones trying to kill the same few mobs, you would barely be able to see the ground let alone have any chance of tagging shit.
---
That or multi-thousand person queues that take hours to get through
---
Yeah there really is nothing else like vanilla.. I’m not planning to get into TOP-charts, just leveling as efficiently as possible. :D
---
But GL for you aswell mate!
---
I believe your faction had to collect the blood of something like 500 or 1000 dead enemy faction players. Whatever the amount was, it took quite a while to get there. 45+ minutes for sure.
---
It doesn't though, this was recently discussed and tested on private servers. Here is someone doing the math back in 2006 too on real vanilla check it out [https://forums.gamegrin.com/showthread.php?t=22583](https://forums.gamegrin.com/showthread.php?t=22583) you can see it helps to counteract abilities that up the chance to resist fears and spells
---
At 8-10 hours per week, he’s looking at ~6 months easily. He’ll hit 60 by the time phase 2 is out. By that point, he’ll be able to join pug groups for mc/bwl and kill several bosses pretty easily, I would imagine.
---
lol nope - I know, I've been in all launches in the pserver scene. I have my routes and everything set up.
---
Really conflicted, really wanna play priest, kinda wanna play Alliance but I hate dwarves man.
---
Fele like fear ward is such a must :(
---
Ele is not a good leveling spec. Takes lots of mana, no spell pushback resis unless you get crit, no spell damage gear until higher levels and most of that is cloth.
---
Oh! I did not know Revenge and Overpower shared CDs, that's pretty huge to know. Thanks!
---
Out of curiosity, can you explain your position on why warlocks have a high gear dependency / have a “brute force” win condition?
---
I'm really curious about a "gold made" from all that grinding
---
Oh my fucking god
---
The human rep bonus is great
---
Thanks a lot! I’ll hit you up with a PM.
---
I already have quite good knowledge of the game and I’ve played some unofficial servers aswell. The ’fastest’ I’ve got so far was around 6,5 days with a shaman and no intention to speed level. Just doing things fast, couple of instances here and there and lot of slacking.
---
But great to hear that there is more of speedrunners! Thanks again mate
---
&gt;They are fairly strong when leveling but they won't break any BiS lists.
---
They absolutely 100% break BIS lists all the way up to at least ZG patch, here is an instance of an item that is way better than anything else in the game for that level (only thing that can compete is Mageblade in MC probably and the staff from Nefarian)
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=20536 (hit not even being a stat for casters pre ZG being insanely valuable, will be a must for wlocks til ZG) 
---
vs your average reward (pre 1.12.1 itemisation)  https://classicdb.ch/?item=10751
---
ST quests should be delayed until Nax, along with all tier 0.5(dungeon sets). And i you think MC was a joke in vanilla, it will be a massive meme in 1.12.1 with 1.12.1 talents+ itemization and having these OP class quests will be a complete overkill.
---
Maybe you can do it on your alt tho, in 2 years.
---
Actually, we don't allow streaming.
---
The extension of more lotuses and devilsaurs is more flasks and gear which then leads to content being easier for the masses.
---
[This thread further down](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bzp2ge/what_should_i_play_wednesdays_june_12_2019/eqwgeoj/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) might give you food for thought.
---
Won't hurt anything besides messing up end-game balance even more.
---
There's some irony here. You are bashing people for essentially being close-minded.
---
Yet, you fail to see all perspectives. If someone is speed leveling, and attempting to do everything as quickly as possible. They will prioritize stronger specs. It's that simple.
---
How many players are on the beta server?
---
Hey guys,
---
I’m concerned with the fact that I may not find a slot open for me as a Druid healer in raids. How many shamans do you take to a raid normally?
---
I really don't see this being a fixable thing.  If they restrict people from doing this, then it would make grouping with your friends a lot more tedious at times. 
---
But yea, layering sucks.
---
&gt; See you in Warsong.
---
*zug zug*
---
I don't want TBC as is post classic.
---
I do like some aspects of TBC though;
---
raised level cap, new items, better class balances, dual specs, arena.
---
however, flying mounts and dailies need to be removed imo.
---
I also wouldn't mind horizontal content (staying lvl 60 in Azeroth) with the TBC raids ported to classic (karazhan, grruls, mag's lair, etc.)
---
The whole idea of this is overthink everything and do it as perfectly as possible. Getting the real life mentality into gaming and seeing what happens. :D 
---
But those sound already impressive numbers!  Let’s hope you can beat that on launch
---
Rogue
---
42 hours per week.
---
Normal 1.7 months
---
Fast 1.5 months
---
It depends completely on how long the target will be alive. I’d recommend trying the warlock discord server, or google. Plenty of vanilla lock guides that cover these aspects of a rotation in detail for mobs that last &lt;20s/&gt;20s/etc.
---
fuck layering.
---
"you have to kill the other ones"
---
You never use either of those while tanking.  Spending the time and gcd's to stance dance, cast overpower in a stance that causes a lot less threat, only to then swap back, would be pointless.
---
To be fair, it's not our fault that races are so imbalanced (even if it matters a lot less than class) in vanilla NE vs Dwarf is not a tradeoff, one is just clearly inferior  (tho still fine in most cases).
---
Never!
---
Thanks for the tips mate!
---
I’m going to keep the doors open always when possible and our ventilation is quite good. I’ll also schedule breaks regularly for the leveling plan for workout and getting my mind of the leveling. I think I need it just to stay sane as I havent really been playing that much lately, even after having a LAN weekend my body and brains feel like shit.
---
I hope the new buyers (owners of hsreplay.net and now hearthpwn) just nuke the forums and never bring them back.
---
Implying a true Barrens chat participant would ever have Herrod's shoulder and Whirlwind Axe
---
Neat. What software did you use to make the image by the way?
---
Y'all need to calm your tits.
---
1. This is beta, problems are exactly what has to/will happen. That's how they're fixed/avoided on release. 
---
2. Even if there was 2 weeks of layering with this problem it would only have a short term impact on supplies of BL, Devilsaur Leather etc. 
---
3. Having the market flooded by one item, lowering its value, happens all the time. If the demand remains high, value won't be affected dramatically and/or market price will recover over time.
---
Because of the use of new technologies like layering the game won't be like vanilla, but we all knew this already.
---
Vanilla has pretty good faction balance, because both factions have their own advantages and different metas (mostly due to shams on horde and pallys on alliance).
---
Alliance have probably the best scaling healers (paladin, crit 100% mana refund), and they have global threat reduction (horde only has group wide with an air totem, which is usually reserved for windfury totem anyways) which means that casters are more viable on alliance. Their different kits gives pros and cons on different encounters (Nefarian being slightly easier for alliance due to pally class call),or poison being easier for Horde due to poison cleansing totem etc.
---
So factions play differently in vanilla.
---
And then you have geographical advantages, Ironforge is completly central to most vanilla content (Blackrock mountain in perticular), while horde has obviously better control of Kalimdor.
---
So I think its pretty likely that the factions will be pretty closely balanced.
---
However, if Blizz goes TBC, the faction balance should be something like 85/15 H/A because in that expansion alliance has no advantages whatsoever, they even have weaker paladins.
---
First character was a Dwarf hunter.  I leveled to 60, and we were doing MC.   Problem was that the Hunter that was from the previous EQ guild kept getting all the loot.   One day he got his 5th piece of Tier 1 giantstalker, and I didn't even have 1.  So, I got pissed off and quit.  I was always on the top of the dmg meter too.   Looking back, it was probably a DKP thing, but even still it seems fishy.   Regardless, I left and joined the horde on another server after that.
---
I played a shaman through the rest of Vanilla.   Made it largely through Naxx, but never finished.  I liked playing elem as a shaman in pvp, and I liked playing a shaman in general.   In Razorgore, we had a cool strat where the shamans would kite the majority of the mobs around while everyone else killed the boss.  Another time I accidentally pulled a boss on me by healing early, but I was able to walk the boss back to the tanks before dying by using NS.   I assume I got some other heals too, but it was still pretty cool.  I also wanted to tank Rag as a shaman, but I never got to do that one.   Guild fell apart before we could do it.
---
I have several concerns.
---
1. Gold farming. (Mage) I played a TON in Vanilla, so I had money, despite being a healer.   I made a lot of it largely by selling potions and flask.   I used my alchemy to make some money.  Even still, I had to buy 1000 gold from gold sellers at one point.    I know that I can farm up bijous with a mage, and make tons of money.   They're the best at making money, but their rotation in raiding is literally just frostbolt in MC.   Later they go fire, which involves rolling ignites somehow.   There is a strategy there, so that wouldn't be quite as boring.
---
2. Leveling. (hunter) I hate leveling in Vanilla.   It takes FOREVER.   This is why I kind of wanted to play a hunter, because they're the best at leveling.   But their dps isn't the best, and it will be much harder to find a group as a dps with crappy CC.   I always kind of liked hunter though.
---
3. Dungeons: (Warrior)  The next issue I have is dungeon farming.  Trying to find a group back when I played a hunter was tough.   I spent countless hours in town just spamming chat for dungeons.   I filled my friends list with tanks and healers, and pestered them nonstop.   Warriors can get a group any time they want though, so that would solve this issue largely.   I played warrior in TBC, and I was quite good at tanking.   Another problem with this though is that everyone and their brother will be playing Warrior, because they're OP and can make a group anytime they want.
---
4. Loot Whoring: (Druid?)  I am a loot whore.   I love big loots, and I don't know why.  So, I don't want to play a class that is extremely overpopulated.  Druid might be the least played?   But they're also the worst healers.
---
5. Disabled ( Pries/Paladin):     I have nerve damage,and it causes discomfort and stiffness in my hands.   I can't play at the same level as I used to because of this.  Using a mouse to cast heals shouldn't be too much of a problem though.   Hitting 20+ keybinds on my keyboard is probably out though, so I need a class that is fairly easy to be competitive with without needing said keybinds.  I will be playing on a pve server this time, and largely focus on pve.  Healing seems like it would be the easiest in PVE, while still being interactive and fun.  But then we are back to the inability to farm gold.  Some people get around this by leveling alts, but I don't like leveling in Vanilla.  It's slow and boring.
---
6. 6.  Meters. (Priest/Warrior)  I like to win the meter.  Healing or Damage, I don't care, but I have to win.  This is another reason I am hesitant to try shaman again.   I used to top the meters despite being a shaman in Vanilla, but as time progressed the priests became too powerful.  Shaman itemization is laughable bad, and I only took 3 pieces of tier 2 for the set bonus.   In tier 3, I couldn't win, unless the fight allowed me to use chain heal.   I know now that shaman healing is lackluster, and we can't compete with paladins and priests.
---
7. Alliance is easy mode.  They have a HUGE advantage in pve, because of Dwarf priests, Human Sword skill, and most importantly, the paladin is just better than the Shaman. Everything the shaman can do, the paladin can do better.    I actually think I prefer the horde, but again, it's hard to pick the horde knowing that the Alliance is not only easy mode, but no one takes that into account when talking about server firsts.  But seeing as my hands are jacked, maybe easy mode is best?
---
I'm just worried all the freash servers that open in the months following launch will have it too for "QoL" reasons... I have zero interest in playing a bastardized version of the game.
---
Maybe not but hitting 60 should be enough to clear MC. Pre raid BiS is great if they staggered raiding it. With MC launching with the game there isn't a reason to get pre raid BiS.
---
So? If you get offended by words you are the one with issues. Grow up.
---
 Hard like Heroic more than you can handle.
---
So lets do it like a druid in general channel.
---
Looking for a casual PvP EU Horde Guild to join at launch.
---
I’m going to play a Shaman or Priest and will be mostly looking to PvP battlegrounds/arena &amp; do some world pvp
---
If I can’t find a Guild with the same interests I’ll most likely make my own. 
---
I have 2 other friends with the same interests that will be playing with me.
---
A nice homage to [Pubmasters 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjY87u3gk1M)
---
I'm pretty sure Bobby B was on the LOTR sub before.
---
I think this is kinda busted as it's suggesting normal leveling speed for a warrior being like 14 days?
---
I leveled a warrior on a p-server in like 7-8 days played while also wasting a lot of time world PvPing and maxing out BS/mining and doing all the dungeons several times. Even if p-server values are off, I still think the estimate is kinda busted :P
---
Layering should be removed entirely after 2 weeks.
---
Then they can also add in the honor system while people are fucking lvling as thats when PvP is most fun (and you can farm those sweet rewards, for example that sweet stam cloak at lvl 30.)
---
&gt; I can't wrap my head around how people still defend sharding / layering.
---
Retail players who suddenly gained an interest in Vanilla. Everyone here who played private servers for years now have been against it.
---
Bandwagoners, who are the primary classic crowd now, are going to defend Blizztard, just like they've been defending them while destroying WoW since WotLK.

Don't even need to be a warlock for this.

So for those wondering whats going on we were told an Alliance raid was in ratchet on the way to Orgrimmar.. we wen't to ratchet and no Alliance.. so I tried to force myself onto the Eastern Kingdoms layer by leaving the group and re-logging to an Eastern Kingdoms character.. and it worked.
---
This is exactly what I was thinking as well.
---
Yeah, but those stop giving any xp after a while.
---
You could still bg if you wanted im sure
---
Orgrimmar being Detroit confirmed.
---
This is absolutely incredible hahaha
---
Where was he 9 months prior?
---
So much information is just dead wrong. Especially respawn times. Warriors safely pulling 3-4 mobs in starting zones? LOL. 
---
This is adroll garbage.
---
They have no outs. They either have to tank hits and kill things with their instants (Soul Link builds) or burst someone down in a Seduction (deep Destruction builds). Both of those setups need a baseline level of gear before they work consistently.
---
They could make it less predictable. If your group is across 2 layers, make the choice of who gets moved completely random at first and then sticky it. If you join someone, you won't know who gets layered and if you try and leave and rejoin, you just end up in the same layer. If your party member is in a city, always force them to move so you can't be out in the world (at a node or rare spawn) and ever get layered.
---
How is it mostly correct when speedrunners like johanna are saying that it is significantelly slower to level in the beta than on privat servers
---
I DON’T.
---
Yes, this is a absolutely about arguing semantics. I'm arguing that by no stretch of the definition of the word, is the new talent system "more complex" than the old talent trees. Something I've seen several times as well. And its just plain wrong. 
---
Maybe the people you mention are using it correctly by accident, and actually mean something else, but I can't very well argue that they are using the word incorrectly then. I'd happily argue against them alongside you, that the old talent system was far from perfect and had way too many borring talents that didn't really have much impact on anything. Again, complexity does not mean quality.
---
The new talent system has more viable talent builds per class, sometimes making the decisions on how to spend your talent points very interresting or even difficult when trying to optimize your build. And each individual talent point is more impactful, arguably making them much better rewards for leveling than a bunch of talent points that add +1% Crit chance on fire spells or reduces your threat generation. (Something that never made a lick of sense to me, how does making my fire magic stronger, also make it less threatening?)

I personally think that by pretty much every concievable margin, the new talents are better, maybe not always in practise but definitely in theory. But they are not complex. They were specifically designed to not be complex.
---
ABSOLUTE HORROR. I CANNOT LIVE. I CANNOT DIE.
---
Im 39, i started a degree at 31 and grad 34. I'm 2 weeks from graduating as an officer in the army!
---
And yes, i have 2 weeks leave approved for wow
---
Yup, that is how I feel as well. Old AV was just a amazing experience. It felt as a zone/warzone and you had to work and do stuff with your team/for your team, to win.
---
I never ever thought old AV sucked because winning takes forever. I just loved being there and having the back and forth between the horde and the alliance.
---
Heh, old AV is what BFA should have been. Old AV has the actual war between the horde and the alliance.
---
The recent version is just a 15 minute zerg where one ignores the enemy and goes straight to the end.
---
I was sick from school. So i decided to go grind my last level on my paladin on the undeads in EPL. I had a dravern Shotgun and a mother fucking Skullflame shield drop that day.
---
I think that was it! Thanks!
---
And each of those people is right, but only for their wow experience.  What made wow great before was a variety of things, and what made people leave was removing or changing a lot of those things.  Don't take any post as face valye, but collectively they tell a pretty straightforward story.
---
I didn't see this today, I'd love to find that clip. I think he's never played Horde his entire time playing WoW, so that'd be interesting.
---
If you play on EU will you be my friend haha. Thanks!
---
It was the LOTR sub.
---
no clue I never played pservers so I don't know what to expect there. I haven't really touched the game since tbc and I figure there will be plenty of people like me doing the same thing.
---
I want to get a night elf to 60!!
---
Let’s not forget the Tauren quest chain in Undercity. If they threat their allies like that...
---
I don't see how tank class choice affects that?
---
thats fucking pathetic lol just play the game pussies
---
I will :) guess I need an adult guild as well haha
---
&gt;	Then later Sylanas goes full on evil...  
---
Excuse me?
---
Yup, all the same. Not hot.
---
You really think Molten Core can be achieved by a casual player? It always seemed so hardcore to me!
---
The reality is often that it is exactly the same on both sides. You will have idiots and you will have chilled people in each.
---
Thanks for your response :) So who are you going to play for your race?
---
Your pet doenst look too happy yet -feed it!
---
&gt;the **orc** is always greener.
---
FTFY :o
---
&gt;Plenty of religious people have to hide their sexuality to avoid persecution
---
You mean catholic priests ? They are pretty open about their sexuality.
---
True! I prefer this month long cinematic experience to a lot of movies haha
---
Only no popcorn :(
---
oce servs should happen, however 1 thing to keep in mind -  there's a very good chance we'll be in the same battlegroup/s as NA, which is going to mean a similar experience to what retail is like at the moment. (250ms in bgs / 10 or whatever ms local)
---
Thanks for your response :) Which class are you going to b-line with?
---
Except that classic launches without bgs.
---
That makes it a different game.. and people here aren't looking to play classic for a different game, they want the same game from before.
---
This zone had been worked on, much like hyjal. However you couldn't wall jump your way in and it never saw release.  As I recall,  many of the previously inaccessible zones pre cata had Ben partially developed.  Along with hell fire in out lands, and the emerald Dream
---
But if you are like me and choose to play a gnome, you can get death ray as early as level 20 while everyone else has to wait till 35 thanks too the +15 too engineering. You'll be able to 1 shot people 10 levels higher

This was the first pvp video my roommate downloaded back in 2005. It's a 3-minute mage doing 3-minute mage things, but it has a ton of personality throughout, and a perfect soundtrack that you won't hear in any other videos
---
10 cent's an hour's good money when you are Chineeese
---
I guess he is referring to the fact there were no locally hosted oceanic servers in classic, and with australia being the way it was we had 256k adsl at best, cup and string internet at worst and dial up was right in the middle, all of us aussies should play with 400-1200ms to truely recreate the experience. 
---
I may as well chime in with my 2c about your initial question. Blizzard already has wow server hardware in the country, I can’t see why we wouldn’t get a Sydney based server, with xrealm bgs I can only assume they would use the same system they use for the retail, where when you get into a bg you connect thru local servers then to a US based bg server hence the local 40ms and world 220ms.
---
Good thing you have time to wipe that shit off your wall before classic releases (;
---
Just teasing man! Looks great!
---
So you logged over to a different toon, then back to the first one and saw an alliance player on a mount?
---
Wow?
---
I am happy with this.  I played horde mostly the first time around, but I intend to go alliance this time for paladins.  I was afraid that the influence of the private server crowd would get a lot of people to roll alliance.
---
I find being the underpopulated side far better then being the zerg.  
---
Yea you will get ganked a bit more, but your faction is forced to work together more, pvp is always easy to find, and you get fast pvp Qs.
---
Retail players literally won't understand why this is bad, unfortunately. We can show all the proof in the world, but all we're doing is showing a cattle farmer slaughterhouse videos and saying "See, what theyre doing!"  
---
Cattle Farmer: "What's the problem friend?"
---
Now you need to get to somewhere everyone can see you and they will think you have leet wall jump skills
---
As a lot will also be playing retail still i think the time might be less even then the 8 hours ... i remember for my first level 60 in vanilla it took around 5 months or so, leveling in an utterly inefficient manner (enjoying it every minute) so im not sure how long it will take me now but the 7.5 months for me look optimistic :)
---
But Baratheons always have black hair. That's the point of what Jon Arryn was refering to with "the seed is strong".

---
What if I'm in Tanaris and want to do Zul'Farrak? I have to run back to Stormwind?
---
why? i rly like mmochamp
---
Why exactly is it not testing ? Testing is playing the game and finding bugs along the way, it's not doing a specific thing. God.
---
No offense, but how far did you get into TBC, and what content did you spend the most time doing?
---
I ask because that tends to be the main indicator on how people remember that expansion. I know people IRL who loved it but never did anything more than Karazhan.
---
I was in a hardcore progression guild in TBC, top 100 US for most bosses through KJ in Sunwell. A lot about TBC wasn’t as awesome as the points you’ve laid out.
---
1.	Class balance was nice, and it felt good to mix it up. Not all specs were brought to raids still, like Ret Paladins or Ele Shaman. It also led to class stacking, especially in Sunwell where having 5 Shaman for full lusting was huge. It was still better than Classic for most, but extremely frustrating for those who fell through the cracks. Although I concede that a lot of what TBC brought was great and iconic for most classes and specs. 
---
2.	This sucked, tbh. That rating system wasn’t intuitive for players at all, and stats like Resilience were a mess. Haste, Spell Pen, and Armor Pen were added stats and completely overshadowed most of the core RPG stats. This was the start of the trend we see on retail with all gear being Stam + Primary Stat and secondaries for differentiation. Besides the ratings and stats themselves, the theorycrafting of finding diamonds in the rough (e.g. edgemasters as BiS, great BWL gear lasting until Naxx, etc) was a bigger part of the gearing experience. Replacing almost all your gear every raid tier seems better, but making upgrades more readily available devalues it all. The feeling of getting an insane MC drop that would last through BWL was exciting. Being stuck with a shitty piece of gear in one slot made finally replacing it that much sweeter. 
---
3.	While I loved the heroic dungeons at the fresh 70 mark, I felt like the badge gear was the wrong direction for the game. Part of it goes back to (2), but it devalued the feeling of getting new gear or the reward of grinding a dungeon over and over for a specific drop off a specific boss. 
---
4.	Probably the worst part of TBC were the daily quests. They were essentially chores, and if you chose not to do them you missed out on that gold which inflated the economy. The main difference is that you really didn’t have the same type of choice as you did in Vanilla. If I wanted to get gold, I could survey the different methods of doing that (herbs, fishing, mining, DM runs, strath runs, tyrs hand, etc.) and choose the one I was in the mood for doing that particular day. With dailies, it wasn’t only an everyday thing, rather it felt semi-mandatory, because otherwise you’d be missing out on free gold essentially. Even if it was stuff you didn’t particularly care for, like Simon Says in BEM or Skettis dailies or slaving away in the Netherwing Mines. Obviously you could choose not to do them, but it was always a lingering feeling like it was something you should do anyway. Again, in Vanilla there was no prescribed method for earning gold, it was completely up to the playerbase to figure out how to best make money and each individual player to figure out which to do, based on their professions of class or spec.
---
5.	covered above. 
---
6.	I didn’t do any low-level BG so I can’t speak to that. But I didn’t like how battlegrounds really dropped in quality compared to Vanilla. Part of it was Arenas pulling more dedicated PvPers out of the queues, but part of it was also the effects of cross-realm battlegrounds leaking over from Vanilla. It made those PuGs into faceless and nameless players you never remembered, and naturally that kind of pseudo-anonymity started to bring out negative qualities in people who would no longer be punished for asshattery like they would be if everyone in the battleground were people they’d need to interact with on the server in the future. Also, the Arena was a fun change of pace for PvP, especially at the competitive level, but it meant that there was no competition in any of the actual battlegrounds anymore. 5v5 was basically a failed experiment in running trains on healers, so 3v3 and 2v2 took over. Because they were so competitive, they became heavily meta-driven, to the point where if you were not running Warrior/Druid 2v2 or a proven comp like RMP in 3v3 you had a soft ceiling until that’s all you’d face. It also let to the start of people  only doing enough PvP and arena each week to earn the free PvP gear, and people selling carries for gold. That often meant facing and getting stomped by gladiators in 3v3 mid-level ratings as they smurfed a carry up to 2k rating. That system had its flaws as well, causing people to queue dodge depending on who was online and playing, or even encouraging people to stop PvPing altogether because they were more likely to lose massive rating if they kept playing. It also fragmented PvP groups because people needed to pair up into groups and be selective on who they played with to maintain their ratings. This got changed in later expansions, for good reason.
---
7.	I agree that Kara/ZA were fun. The other raids... not so much. There was a lot of pain raiding then, for a number of reasons. Obviously the jump from 40 to 25 person raids was met with a lot of enthusiasm, because it was easier to organize them and guilds could cut some of the fat for people who didn’t tend to pull their own weight. Things like full consumes and flasks being more necessary than in Vanilla made raiding more expensive. Gruul was initially bugged in the expansion which led to a lot of problems. SSC had tons of boring trash packs throughout the instance with super short respawn timers, such that you often spent more time just clearing trash in a given night than doing boss progression kills. Sometimes you would not even do a boss attempt if trash would respawn during the attempt and wipe you, so you’d sit there waiting on it to repop before you could do anything. Overall the fights were pretty good, but there was always a bit of a sore spot there. TK was pretty dumb, with Lootreaver being a joke and Solarian being bugged. A lot of fights were bugged actually, with Kael’Thas being basically unkillable until Blizzard fixed those issues. Same with Vashj, bugged to shit, felt like banging your head against a wall. Plus trash mobs. Clearing SSC was rarely ever a fun time. Hyjal when released was probably one of the worst raids they’ve ever added to the game, almost like a fucking joke at the R&amp;D forum’s expense, being literally wave after wave of trash. Black Temple was pretty good, but getting to Shahraz was another trash nightmare, and needing shadow resist for this particular fight was a weird decision. Killing Illidan the first time was great, though. Sunwell was mostly good, except the IoQD exemplified a lot of the previous issues with badge gear/gems and boring daily quest grinds. Progression was fine, but Muru killed lots of guilds until Blizzard just straight up nerfed the fight. Oh well. A lot of this stuff just contributed to burn-out in players, needing to do all the daily quests, slog through SSC/TK/Hyjal trash each week, clear BT which was a pretty long raid, then do Sunwell as well, not to mention ZA popping up. 
---
8.	Leveling alts was a lot more daunting in TBC than it was in Vanilla, even though this was a way people keep the game fresh or relax. Later on the reduced the leveling EXP needed, but before that you were looking at the full 1-58 grind (with some improvements thanks to Draenei/BE zones) and then redoing all of the L70 attunement grind, reputation grinding, etc. while now farming dailies on multiple characters instead of just one, so if you didn’t like those quests it’s an extra dose of “too fucking bad”.
---
As someone who raided through the endgame of both vanilla and TBC, I’d much rather stick with the Vanilla experience. If they could find a way to recreate TBC without a lot of the worst aspects, (flying mounts, xrealm BGs, buggy raids, daily quests, unfucking arena, welfare epics) I’d reconsider playing. Having done it all before though, no thanks.
---
no, this would be worse than playing on NA west.
---
Is it bad that i love these guys LOL
---
I'm not sure but I think the Headland and the Blackened Marches should have their level ranges swapped. If they were then there would be a nice leveling path from the Swamp of Sorrows up to the Burning Steppes and another one from the Wildhammer Highlands into the Burning Steppes.

then no layering and overcrowded it is, cause that's how it was.
---
Launch day Vanilla was awful and server kept crashing.
---
can't have both
---
I don't think that's even humanly possible. Anyone who is CAPABLE of doing that is already on some other shit like this on a regular basis. Most likely with the help of substances. One doesn't just develop a habit for the sake of WoW.
---
Meaningful work, with meaningful relationships!  Report to HR, employee 4859285!
---
Thats exactly the reason why I want them to remove it or at least lock a Character permantly to a layer.
---
Maybe its even as easy as logging out and in again. Has anyone tried that? Don't think there is eastern kingdoms layer and kallimdor layer. A layer is the whole world so it might just have assigned you to another layer for some reason.
---
Are you strictly doing a duo? I want a group of people to relax and grind with. If you're in on that, add me on release NoxViginti#11846
---
The movie was a solid watch to be honest. For a movie based on a game, it was surprisingly good. That's a rarity.

surly they will, ive added up the guilds RECRUITING sofar for oceanic pvp, there is a fair amount.

What is the funnest class for PvP? I’m going horde and I want to play a class that’s really fun in PvP (mostly BGs but also world pvp). I enjoy a class that’s able to outplay and make cool things happen. I hate playing healers, and would also like to be able to progress casually through raids. I don’t need to be the best dps, but I don’t want to be useless. I also don’t like respecing heaps since I’ll often be swapping between PvP and PvE. Any recommendations?
---
For a semi-casual mainly interested in wPvP I think you can throw warrior out right away for all the reasons you mentioned.
---
As for boring raid rotations — you're there for the gear anyway. Chat up your raid members or download the tetris addon or put a show on in the background (and don't wipe the raid obviously). You can also discard all your raid slotting apprehensions since you're playing a meta dps class and will already be attractive to min-maxers. Just do a deep dive in guild recruitment sections, send some messages out and you'll get there.
---
If you cut out that chaff Mage and Warlock stand out from your list of pros/cons. Rogue's failings in group pvp are a big con and you don't like Hunter's flavor and play-style. It's true Warlock has bad match-ups against melee classes but Mages have their counters too: Warlocks, Shadow Priests, and to a lesser extent Shamans and Hunters. It's also true that Mages come online faster but it seems like you're going to put in the work to make that difference irrelevant. I think if you choose between the two going purely by class fantasy you can't go wrong.
---
What would you say other major key methods are comparable in effect to having summoning teams?
---
You also need to be using demo and battle shout more frequently...than well, never...which is what you allude to.
---
Demo shout causes threat each mob affected.
---
Battle Shout causes threat to each mob in range per friendly player affected. 
---
So a battle shout cast on all 4 of your buds and yourself produces a good bit of threat. Toss a demo shout and now you’ve got enough threat where healing agro won’t peel them off you.
---
Then you can go to revenge, slam, sunder, cleave/Heoric strike with tab targeting.
---
I’m not positive, but I think continuous casting of battle shout keeps building rage.
---
okey :)
---
If you think layering won't return for AQ then I have a bridge to sell you
---
Would make it a bit harder to abuse, but not stop it. If you want to push a player you can have a mage make portals and a wl summon back to where the action istl.
---
I thought r/gameofthrones was bad due to the moderators but r/asoiafcirclejerk is quite possibly the most vile subreddit I've come across. They specifically hate r/freefolk due to the discussions we've had there regarding the abysmal quality of season 8 and the general decline since season 5. Last I checked they were pissed off because we made a charity to show our appreciation for the cast of the show. It's just pathetic.
---
I'm american but I'm also looking for a group of people to relax and grind with. Add me on release if you want some **freedom** in your party :) NoxViginti#11846
---
Imo it would be fine with layers until 30 becaus Its gonna be a shit show in The barrens aswell
---
this is a bit upsetting
---
Could make it all resting zones, so your group meets in the tavern in Gadgetzan.
---
I really hope we get oceanic servers 300+ms in 2019 is a massive disappointment and nearly a turn off from classic
---
Coincidentally enough, episode 2 was done by an entirely different writer and was completely free of D&amp;D's writing skills.
---
Why do you feel the need to bring someone down for finding a place to vent? 
---
Nobody comes here to read this kind of shit. Keep it to yourself.
---
NO HAIR
---
russians are the unfun type of cancer though.
---
I'd suggest Mage, Hunter, or Warlock, in that order.
---
And enslave which in some wing in DM works wonders as well to get a real powerfull demon.
---
You've not met politicians yet have you?
---
In the german Version it says "cleared the Azora Tower" instead of jarods landing.
---
Knowing the game for a bit back then already, I was kinda confused, because I didnt knew if it actually was possible to quest/kill something there.
---
I don't care about queues - we've been waiting for YEARS, what's another week tops?
---
I'd argue season 7 was extremely stupid and rushed but it had at least some layer of entertainment behind it. Episode 4 for example was enjoyable in my opinion despite a fair few flaws. Season 8 wasn't just bad writing, it was incredibly dull. The finale was quite possibly the most boring episode I've seen in a series. The only redeeming quality of season 8 was the actors. Emilia Clarke was superb.
---
Also part of an announcer pack in Smite hehe
---
So how went your test ?
---
Ironforge for the LFG function :)
---
I sincerely hope you find peace as time presses forward. You have my deepest condolences. Hope you enjoy Classic and I hope to see you there!
---
Great, he still said exactly what I said he did. I didn't say anything about Method deciding to go for world firsts.
---
Josh, why are you so bald?
---
So, if you're in different layers from someone, can you interact through chat? Or do they keep that separate?
---
I think that was the idea. The casual South Park viewer would be like "ok, that's something epic probably" and an actual player of the game would be dying laughing because they know that just means he's like level 11.
---
N O G E A R N O H A I R

Depends where you live. For servers in Seoul and Shenzhen, you're absolutely correct. But Adelaide, Brisbane, Canberra, Melbourne, and Perth all have better average pings to Taipei than they do Los Angeles. NA West is only a better option for Sydney.

How much Gold did you get
---
My imaginary gf would kill me for having scented candles.. I am suspecting she is actually a horde supporter.
---
I hope that every time you see "1.13", you get triggered.
---
SSC, TK and Hyjal were all on release I think but of course the convoluted attunement kept people out of them for a while. Could be wrong but I think it was all 6 of those
---
Doesn't stop rare spawn exploiting
---
I like mmo but I wish they would upgrade the forums. Trying to click a topic while using a phone is like playing a fps.
---
I wonder if all the inconsistencies in this episode were done on purpose just to fuck with us nerds :D
---
Is there going to be a beta access wave to get more player in this time?
---
Looks amazing, great job
---
From the first moment they anounced it i knew ot was bad to have layering in the game. The market will be fucked , layering has to or has to be only in the starting zones, 1-10 or even 1-20 . Everyting beyond that is bad . People need to get more vocal about this.
---
I got a 24 hour ban for saying that in Asmongold's chat
---
If there is only 2-3 layers and 2500-3000 per layer.
---
How many do you get in the starting zones?
---
How does this alleviate the pain of questing in starting zones ?
---
&gt;I have nerve damage,and it causes discomfort and stiffness in my hands.   I can't play at the same level as I used to because of this.  Using a mouse to cast heals shouldn't be too much of a problem though.
---
This should inform your decision more than anything else. Mage doesn't get any less boring once they switch to fire, but it sounds like easy is what you're after. They level fast, farm fast, top the damage meters, and are easy to play.
---
It was right after they got fucked at gurabashi arena so it coulda just been said out of frustration but he did also say his first character was a undead and if he did go horde he roll undead for the extra nostalgia.
---
First time I would most likely laugh while getting ganked.
---
Nicely done, though for me the adrenaline kick that hit you once being chased by those crocolisk was part of the fun :)
---
Yea the fast ques I hadn’t considered that is a very good point.

Certainly hope so. I always saw layering as a way for them to cut the cost of classic re-release. Considering how much more popular it is than the retail version of the game id expect them not to add layering ...
---
That guy is a complete retard. I'm very glad I don't watch WoW Streams. There is absolutely nothing that gives away that this guy isn't serious.
---
0 implication, someone who had already been shaped by the barrens chat might have them.
---
Imagine how much they must have paid Blizzard to get the copyright for all those icons and the world map.
---
You say that, but you'll change your mind when you're stuck staring at a login screen when lots of people are already playing.
---
This thread is a testament to your mental retardation that will live on the internet forever
---
&gt; then no layering and overcrowded it is, cause that's how it was.
---
Launch day vanilla had the servers capped at 2000-2500 people and it's entirely possible Classic launch will actually have more players than the actual vanilla launch in 2004.
---
SSC and TK were tier 5, Hyjal and BT were tier 6. Kara gruul and mag were t4.
---
It was definitely a yo-yo between fun and frustrating, especially as Horde. We have some built in disadvantages. I spent a lot of time stuck on the goddamn bridge while Allies turtled.
---
Not the most fun in the world.
---
Hey OOGA boys. Find or msg me in game and i'll give you all free enchants and all the food you'll need. I've got the good stuff.
---
It is faster if you know what to do and all 5 players are commited to play for the same amount. But you have to pull everything in sight nonstop, to compensate for the loss of exp. Drop quest loot on beta shared for the group iinm. Dungeons as a competent group will be faster than solo leveling atleast 30-40 in SM.
---
There's absolutely no fucking way 9.0 is the last WoW expansion. Even if there were working on WoW 2.0 there's no way it will be ready for at least another 5 years, they're currently working on Diablo 4 and OW 2.  
---
Classic is hyped and understandably so, but people will eventually get bored of it - just like retail.
---
Ridiculous. I signed up to a 3rd-day-Ragnaros guild, Blizz better make sure I get a ~~shard~~ layer all for myself.
---
Thought ring and necklaces did not come into game until BC.
---
I read about Broken Tooth, and camped my level 45 hunter at one of the spawn points. I got it, and was so proud of it.
---
It was only when I started playing on private servers, that I found out, that you had to upgrade pet's skills, by taming and learning from new pets. So for many years, I ran with a rare 'über' pet, and in reality didn't get anyway near the max from the potential. I was so happy about the pet none the less... 
---
Ignorance is bless!
---
He did like a run and a half in RFD. I think he made like 3 gold and 50s and that was including the random stuff he had in his bag from earlier grinds that he sold to make space in his bag. So I wasn't very impressed.
---
Instances remove you from the world layer entirely. Zone inside and you should see your party. At least that's how the wm on/off layers work on retail. I can see a WM on party members location on the map but wont see them in the world unless I go turn on war mode or they turn it off.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=13361 Im almost sure
---
Female Tauren are 200% legit.
---
You cant do much to stave of the natural fatigue, but what you can do is to train your brain to focus for periods if it is accustomed to recieving a reward after every period.
---
You can start training that now, play for however long you feel is none tiring, as soon as your thoughts turn to something else, stop and record the number and work from there. Each session increase the number of minutes before taking a break by a few, and every few days shorten the breaks you take in between to get yourself used to playing for longer periods, closer together.
---
Eventually you will find your own comfortable limits, for me it's doing any activity that requires concentration for 1hr 30 - 2hr means I'll need a 15 minute break. For you it might be shorter but shorter breaks or longer with longer breaks. 
---
It might be an idea to try some longer periods if you want to front load the leveling to get ahead of the pack - try to stay focused on a task for 4/5/6 hrs and check your  recovery time and then work on that.
---
Layering (a fancy word for phasing at this point) is **the** issue to push them to improve on, it doesn't get nearly as much attention as it deserves.  
---
At the very least they should make it so both __player and NPC__ interactions "sticky you" to your layer (especially combat interaction).  
---
Else phasing is going to be as much of a thing as it is in current retail.  
---
I'd also take the claims of it being temporary with a huge grain of salt, there is absolutely no way to guarantee that your server concurrency will "magically" settle to ~3k by phase 2 so you can have a 2006-like pop on a single layer for all servers.
---
Probably yes. Basically anytime the guide says you should ding "X" you're going to have to grind up the difference. Otherwise some quests won't be available to you and it will mess up the whole system. The odd instance here and there with the quest for it would also work to bridge the gap.
---
There is no sharding. Its layering. So apparently now, yes you will get an entire server worth on 1 layer.
---
This is still unclear though
---
Yeah, it won't be used further, Ion confirmed it.
---
I'm sure it's now in Classic only for better testing with more people.
---
missing the point that the guy was asking for later patch class features before everyone else it was a point.
---
It's the usual of course everyone wants their own but not others stuff basically.
---
After a certain point don't you not get XP for killing such low level things?
---
&gt;Do Druids often get invited to tank stuff pre-60? And are they capable of healing dungeons with some int gear and a feral spec?
---
Yes.
---
&gt; Are Druids viable dungeon healers at 60 (as only healer in the group)? I imagine Priests getting easier into groups. 
---
Yes again, but your lack of a normal resurrect can suck.
---
&gt; Druids will be geared fast if they can into raids. Are their tier sets any good? 
---
BiS is a bunch of cloth until you get to T3, same as Paladins.
---
&gt; What are the main differences in raid healing for Druid vs Priest? (Is Druid just HT rnk. 4 spam?) 
---
For the most part it is but you dump Regrowth+Rejuvenate on faster fights.
---
Bob isn't doing the highest possible damage bro
---
Ehm, not true.
---
Enhancement is really just their leveling spec. Unlike arms warrior, at 60,shamams lack the ability to close to melee range. A good player of almost amy class can keep you out of range and kill you.
---
That said, elemental is a completely legit, fun, pvp spec. With good gear (especially after aq40 is out) an ele shaman can vaporize people, and will have the durability to survive hits, with the mana and some bonus healing for at least a limited amount of healing (enhance gear has little int and no +heals). 
---
Most raids want 4 shaman minimum. You can heal as ele/resto without respeccing, although no mana tide totem is frowned upon. In healing gear, of course.
---
Hydramist has been streaming a lot of classic priest content
---
You're a good cow/elf
---
Not even just black people but any "tribal culture". "Ooga booga" is just a way to denigrate someone's culture as primitive.
---
Also, in response to /u/Iamkennybania: It's a meme, so I'm sure idiots have used it out of context. That doesn't change the entirety of the meaning behind the meme.
---
But even knowing all of this I don't see how it's particularly offensive in this context. It's a group of Troll rogues (I'm not even gonna make the "trolls playing trolls" joke) calling themselves primitive, using a meme and killing everything that moves. 
---
Why should I care? I just want to play WoW...
---
Even the streamers no-lifing it AoE grinding Scarlet Monastery with 3-4 Mages were taking over 24hrs to go from 30-40. Vanilla is for real.
---
I hope the paladin patrol will take care of this... trolling

How can you judge someone based on a couple short clips?
---
This kind of shit is what makes Classic so fun. Tons of people on the classic PVP server know the Ooga gang now. I've been playing WoW for a long ass time and I can't name anyone outside of my guild on my server anymore. 
---
I miss that server community
---
Just level as enhance but hold on to Quest rewards and drops that have intellect on them, this is good enough to allow you to heal level appropriate dungeons up to at least level 50
---
At least he asked kindly, I suppose
---
In doing the 1 quest where you need to kill the low level spiders and wolves in Duskwood I got ganked by a ?? level 2 different times, and thats just trying to do 1 quest while on the complete opposite side of the entrance to STV.
---
He looks like buff Jesus
---
The level 30 dueling competition had something like 100K Twitch viewers across all of the various competitor's streams.
---
That's not much less than Overwatch League gets during semi-finals...and that game has millions of players.
---
Summoning is definitely the big one. "Hey, I'm about to ding X and need a summon to Y trainer in Z city" is huge. You're in and back out to your leveling zone with your new skills in just a couple minutes. Our goal is to eliminate the need for any long flight paths and certainly any zeppelin use. Almost all of our support staff are running warlocks.
---
Always having money is another good one. We won't have a raid team member that can't afford any necessary skills or their level 40 mount. Most of them can do this completely on their own, but those that can't will have assistance. This also eliminates the need for caring about bag space, though we'll be supplying those too (I cut a lot of time off my best time by simply not looting anything except quest mobs). Definitely don't take any professions.
---
Along with bags. Getting a dump of cloth, potions, food, water, useful greens, enchants, ammo, etc whenever you get into town is nice. We have one guy who will just be sitting in the city and monitoring everyone's gear and consumables to know when they need refueling and potential upgrades from the AH.
---
We have dedicated tri-teams (warrior tank + healer + warlock) for certain dungeons we think are big leaps. They'll just be gunning for a certain level and then running their assigned dungeon over and over until no one in the raid team needs them. That cuts out any and all need for LFG and they can share quests. Same for most group quests.
---
Some of our members have been doing dual leveling with a partner and have insane times for classes that usually suck.
---
On our official routes (I haven't posted good enough times on our own server to have access to all of them), but on the ones I do have, the steps that can be done in any order get randomized so we don't all end up competing with each other.
---
There are certain things that just come with practice (I'm on my 6th 30 to 40 route now after 2 rogues to 60 and a dozen or so 1 to 20 + 20 to 30). Knowing when to kill yourself and take rez sickness, knowing where you're going next at all times, knowing when you can skip a particular quest because you've made up the XP grinding on mobs during travel, etc.
---
[Dirge] (I know it’s TBC)

The more you dig, the more parallels you find between Warcraft and aSoIaF.

Do you mean drop quests like loot gather 8 bat wings? Or a quest that wants one specific item drop from mobs?

Ive always seen international routing to be a problem, while i dont have a problem myself been on internode, mainstream providers like optus have shit throughput via the link from perth to singapore. ill get about 100 ping to jakarta, and 180 to singapore. but some ISPs will route traffic to SEA by guam, so its not faster, they can see really high pings, My ping to Seoul is like 220 for me. but only 150ms to San Jose/LA from melb. Hosting somewhere in mainland asia would be worse than hosting in SEA. and hosting in SEA is worse than NA. While sure we might sometimes see lower ping to SEA, packetloss and pings would spike quite often for a lot of people.   
---
I just checked taipei, getting like 230ms ping there too, So i dunno. 
---
All the main seacables leave Australia from syd or perth, most of AU pop is on the eastern seabboard, perth has really fuck all pop compared to there so linking out of sydney or hosting in sydney is more logical. Also NA pop speaks english where asia doesn't.
---
What class? If it's in the video I didn't watch it as I'm at work.

You have no idea of wtf you're saying. GTFO of this sub. What you just said goes against the very idea of **why** Vanilla is looked back upon fondly. You fucking welfare panderer.
---
What fresh servers?
---
Thanks for the suggestions - those 3 I’ve been heavily thinking about and seem like fun! What about rogue?
---
I quit after WOTLK. Feral druids were very different before Mangle, their burst DPS was not great and they were  underdogs when filling most roles. Bear tanks have their place and even min/maxers will make use of them — they have better threat/second than prot warriors and much better AoE threat. Don't expect to be taken on as cat dps without good networking.
---
It's still a versatile, mobile class with some fun tools but your damage will be more attrition-based and you'll have to fight some prejudice to do what you want.
---
I just really enjoy questing to level, so I want to get my fill, but I respect to hunt to help every npc of Azeroth!
---
Paladins don't tank in raids. They have no taunt, no way to regain mana, not enough +def gear to reach uncrittable until AQ, and no way to reliably knock crushing blows off the combat table. They just shouldn't be tanks in Vanilla raids.
---
You can tank 5mans, and even be pretty good at it, but parry haste really doesn't matter in 5mans.
---
Not really if you just want that sweet quest reward
---
I think this way is faster. (I've tested different running methods on pservers).

However what he does wrong in this video is that he swims all the way from the docks. Instead you should get on the boat to theramore and jump off it at the right moment, that boat goes exactly the same way as he swims so it would shave of a couple of minutes more.
---
Find a warrior to pair up with, otherwise you're in for some pain. Both of you have very weak solo leveling experiences but together you make a great combo that can clear mobs and players quickly.
---
Tracy was the worst character in any tv show, ever.  
---
Worst part is that he was created to make the show appeal more to western audiences over Brock, not that the Snap game did him any favors xD
---
yeah you will prob need to grind. 
---
In cases where you need to kill x mobs, xp for the mob will be less than the avg solo player
---
however gather quests like collect x eyes, will see you kill 2x the required mobs. so xp here is even. 
---
But you will still be at less XP overall per quest done, so you will need to supplement with grinding. as many of the guides are expecting you to be a certain level at a certain quest hub to get all the quests.
---
well the creation of this post had a 2nd meaning as i hope to create curiosity towards unique details mostly overlooked so info about unique details will be uncovered during beta :)
---
there are a lot of oddities in 1.12.1 and its hard to know if they where considered bugs or intended and only release of classic will show :)
---
For example Hydros a boss in Dire Maul could be soloed by any player as long as they had a bow or ranged attack due to pathing issues it had until early TBC, ofc that will be fixed on classic but exactly things like that make me wonder where the line between bug to be fixed &amp; acceptable lies :)
---
And more consumers tbf
---
because they are pathetic. venting this kind of personal stuff on a subreddit for a video game is pathetic. i can already make up from his post he lives in US and is white trash most likely. im so sick of all that pathetic whining. your sister died and you go scream it from the roof and make a character in a fucking video game. pathetic and sick of this shit.
---
Black Lotus was for around 30G-35G during vanilla.
---
Source: I made hundreds of flasks during retail vanilla and i.e. Flask of Supreme Power went for around 70-90G which had dreamfoil and my cut in it. Fun fact: if I saw any cheaper ones I would buy them out and post them with my price.
---
The people who abuse layering are the people who run mafia's, 24/7 tryhards who abuse every advantage. Layering is good for them and they just keep more leather to themselves and keep supply low.
---
Fresh crowding and the elwynn/dun morough run might make teldrassil a decent location to level in at launch
---
If they did that, you still wouldn't see each other till you get out of the starting area (1-6). Then you guys are waiting about 20-30 minutes for the orc to get to you. So sure if you don't mind 1. waiting for them to get to you. 2 hope that the orc got lucky and leveled extraordinarily fast or else you are waiting even longer.
---
Why don't they just layer all the zones up to level 20 or something?
---
I honestly assume people will just use Details! why install a seperate addon when your damage meter already does it?
---
How does one kill, that which has no life
---
Welcome to any launch, ever.
---
Anyone wanna make an alliance ooga gang and stream snipe the shit out of people
---
Always keep in mind that you can pull separately, or even quest completely separately, without disbanding the group. You may often find that it just doesn't make sense to jump on each other's pulls: you clip dots, you turn "every fight" abilities into  "not every fight" abilites, etc. 
---
Get on voice if you can, if not, typing in party chat is good enough, and just coordinate through the zone.
---
There are not many quests you will need to skip by duo leveling, and you may find that you complete them with less total exp earned (because things like "kill 20 bears" now means "kill 10 bears.... each". But this just means that you can spend more time grinding your ideal mobs.
---
You also will find it much more practical to run crafting professions, as your convenient market just doubled and your farming rate on materials stayed the same or even increased slightly (Because now hard to get nodes due to mob spawns can be easily done... even if you can't kill the mobs, one of you pulls them all and runs, and the other gathers the node while the runner leashes the mobs). 
---
In terms of what you should grind, the most important part is "when should you grind". You should grind during the natural power spikes of your class: typically when you get imporant ranks of abilities, or when you get a weapon upgrade for non caster classes. Sure, the best way to grind as a warrior is to be in teldrassil and have a druid thorns you and then fight cats with their 1.3 second swing timer. But I would say it's far more practical to think just "I got rend at level 4, so I am strongest in the 4-5 range and I should try to focus on grinding then, rather than get behind on exp and try to grind from 8-9.". 
---
Ideally, don't be the same armor type: swapping BOE drops is very valuable, much as swapping buffs is.
---
The classic advice is to push you towards dwarf priest for fear ward. If you're going to play with a warrior there's no reason to roll warlock as you'd forfeit all of your synergy, but I don't think you should play a class just for someone else's sake unless you're sure you'll be together for a long time.
---
 Layering....you mean sharding? How are people not losing their shit over this?
---
I skip Duskwood on PvP servers for the most part. It's right next to Redridge so it also gets camped.
---
This. "at least this one looks good", whew u/og_on_a_stik what did you smoke and where can I get some? I really hope this one is fake, I'm all about that blood and thunder but lord green jesus have mercy is that a shitty tattoo.
---
There is potential for some nice pvp in the funnel south of Falmar
---
Kala is also a decent player and his main is a Priest. He sometimes posts here with his guide videos for Priest, which I highly recommend you check out. His recent leveling guide was quite good.
---
I am keeping myself on the same line by frequently playing a song 'Call to Arms'. When I hear 'Gloria, Honorfice  
---
, Praelium Facio" I become enough energized to keep thinking that I will play a paladin.
---
Creeper, my point is not that a ret can keep up with top dps specs. I know they can't and I fully accept that.
---
What I question is the hardcore mentality of "I won'T bring this spec, because it's suboptimal". This may be true for the top end of guilds, where everybody is expected to bring their A-game, but it really doesn't matter for anybody else.
---
You don't advertise a flagrant disregard for the raids success by bringing suboptimal specs, because it doesn't matter all that much. 
---
Why? Because: 
---
1) A player with a suboptimal spec is very likely more dedicated than an average palyer of an optimal spec and can keep up with some of them regardless, as seen in the logs of raids bringing those specs. I've checked several and I've never seen a ret/druid/shaman or shadow priest be dead last in dps.
---
2) The content doesn't require you to be optimal. How many times do you wipe at a boss at 3% or less, where the extra 200-500 dps you get from that optimal spec makes the difference between a kill and a wipe? 95% of the time going optimal just means, oyu are done with the raid 30 minutes quicker, not actually hampering your progress.
---
3) We've seen how little it matters as your example raid with a ret and a shadow priest and several weak mages and warlocks relatively easily cleared 14 bosses in Naxx.
---
I'm completely fine with top guilds aiming for server firsts rejecting hybrid specs, because they want to get the maximum out of everything, if you are of that mentality, cool, then enjoy the game your way. But when I hear about semi hardcore guilds saying a hybrid would actually hinder progress and just rejecting them out of that principle, but then likely end up with some mediocre mage, lock, rogue or warrior, I really don't understand their behaviour.
---
Slight's Nope: Southhill
---
Failz has a video of him soloing a place or two in DM as an elemental shaman.
---
I could see Lost Ones from the swamp making their way north into these areas. They're only found in two zones right now so they would add some nice variety.
---
why are they in line
---
that sounds about right. Guessing you didn’t play
---
vanilla?
---
I think the best group leveling is within a guild, just come online and join some mates to do a bit of leveling/dungeoning and then log off and see who's on the next day. Fixed 5-man groups might work for people that want to race to 60 in a week but otherwise it wil be impossible.
---
It can be done with a low latency, atomic pub/sub service implementation with something like redis that all layers communicate with.
---
Assume a lotus spawns in 2 layers and is assigned an Object ID, 10.
---
Player A L1 - harvests node -&gt; SET 10:A {seconds until they can harvest it again)
---
Player A layer hops into L2, the world server would need the expiry timestamp likely in the zone loading screen like you said so it does not render the node on his client.
---
This sort of complexity probably can’t be introduced this late into development due to lack of testing/qa time, although it is possible.
---
Overall having gold values in any guide is pretty bad thing. It's always server specific how much thing X sells. Sure you can say "Black Lotus is really rare so it will probably sell for quite well" but you can never tell. One server it might be 100g, another server 80g and one has 150g. It's all about supply and demand.
---
I leveled as a 5man in TBC and were were one of the fastest to level on our server, we only saw like 2 solo players and 1 other 5 man on the enemy faction once we were in the 3rd zone.   
---
but with different spawn rates and quest style with their shitty drops rates in classic, i dunno, i dont think its viable for really fast speeds.
---
\*Southwest of the X-roads
---
Oh, can you not start the 1-5 quests as another race? I must have been misinformed.
---
Or you dont be a nonse and trickle them into the AH so you get max profits....
---
As a tauren in a dungeon with a low ceiling, they really help you see what you are doing. The character model is really big and blocking a lot of the view if you can't zoom out to much.
---
He never dies in Sharpe, he just kills lots of 'frog bastards'
---
To loot a quest item. There are two problems at play here, though: the quest item spawn time is too long, and the server has too many players.
---
And after you mounted, you could jump across the roof where the stairs are, and get ontop of the cog like structure in the back
---
The lag would prevent you from getting dismounted instantly when doing the jump
---
HUNTER! you will want every  weapon that spawns up in the entire freaking game. If I were you I’d join a raiding guild and never never never leave my house again.
---
Paladins can’t taunt and will use all their mana on every pull.   If those things are fine for you than go for it.   Leveling is slow. But easy.
---
In this case it still sucks because often getting to the dungeon is quite hard solo, depending on your class. The elites are not just inside the instance. Hoping layers only in rested area would be a great choice.
---
Pala tanks will really struggle without a taunt. You’d need an understanding group but could be done.
---
Even in this tiny beta layers still occur. People defending layers actually btfo.

Classic rap battles of Azeroth

&gt; Knowing when to kill yourself and take rez sickness, knowing where you're going next at all times, knowing when you can skip a particular quest because you've made up the XP grinding on mobs during travel, etc.

Yeah, I'm not in beta but I've been practicing 1-10 spirit rezzing to skip long walks where possible, but it looks like the rest of what you're advocating requires being integrated into support networks I just don't have access to.  Thanks for the answer, anyways.

stuff like this should be at the top of the subreddit. meanwhile we got bad memes and other irrelevant bs

By entirely possible, you probably mean definitely. There weren't even a million player on launch day.
---
source on max lvl 20 zones?
---
iirc they only thing the promised(which tbf doesn't even mean much) is the end of phase 1 at the latest.
---
Super hardcore guilds will probably clear mc within the second reset. 
---
Semi hardcore guilds will clear mc within a month after release. Casual guilds will clear mc maybe 2 months in. Scrub guilds will clear it 4 months in.
---
Rogue has big problems in group pvp. In BGs you'd be stuck defending most of the time.
---
How do you think does Tailor/Ench. compare to Herb/Alch in terms of goldmaking? 
---
It feels like Tailoring is a bit more selfsustaining because it is automatically farmed while doing dungeons/quests but Enchanting can be a bit inconvinient as it requires to sit in the capital and watch the trade chat.
---
&gt;i knew it was bad to have layering in the game
---
Wow, amazing foresight. You're literally the only one that thought that.
---
Wow, I hadn't read this before. What a bunch of manchild crybabies.
---
I tried prot pally tanking on a private server and found this to be the case unless I used a lot of mp5 gear, which I unfortunately had to sacrifice defensive stats for. It's definitely doable but I don't think it's as efficient or fast as prot warrior or druid.
---
High quality content right here

Hey, me and my night elf buddies are gonna go explore the Tower of Azora together, wanna join?
---
Literally this. The Mafias are 100% going to abuse this.
---
Haha, wow thats gotta suck. But nice of them to actually stand in line.
---
Mafia depends on both factions, it's bannable on official servers.    
---
If a guild is dedicated to establishing a monopoly, so can an opposite faction guild. That's just PvP. 
---
When you put layering into this, yeah it's not ideal, but it's not Mafia like on pservers.
---
Joanas guide is designed for solo play but that is a double edged sword. You'll want to do some quests that it doesn't have you do solo. Yes youll be short in xp if you just follow it but if you do group quests or elites with it you'll be fine.
---
Needs a "Hot Pockets Eaten" tracker.
---
1-6 you should do alone if you are following Joana's guide as the XP Gains are halved in a group and Joana's guide for most areas are specific to the XP you gain, for example the Orc/Troll start zone says to slay 7 boars to get lvl 2 then do a quest then kill the remaining 3 boars however in a group you would have to kill double to ding to lvl 2.
---
Leveling speed as ret is fine I think. I switched to prot in the 50's and grinded devilsaurs and other mobs to 60 pretty quickly. I had good gear though.
---
I think the only truly worthwhile things to stance dance for are berserker rage (or whatever the fear immunity skill is called) intercept for when a mob gets away from you and mocking blow if your taunt is on cooldown.
---
I want to play this game for months or years, so I want it to be as good as it can be. I literally don't care about one chaotic week. I waited on two private server launches already because it felt too overcrowded - I am confident I could do it again. It's this irrational fear of MISSING ALL THE HYPE that's the problem. 
---
Private servers had this too, it's people unironically asking if they're too late to start playing on a server that released 2 months ago.
---
divide the number of players you see by 5 and that's classic. You're still looking at a waiting much longer than the xp reward is worth.
---
Paladin leveling does improve at certain milestones, but it still remains the worst class to level.
---
As far as tanking, the only problem with paladin tanking (in dungeons only, in raids there are just too many problems for a paladin to be viable) is your threat. The closest thing you have to a taunt is Blessing of Protection and that doesn't force the mob to attack you, it just forces the mob to not attack one party member. You absolutely need the talents for this and the talents for Improved Righteous Fury. After that, your biggest problem is running out of mana.
---
ZF is a pretty clear shot up, no? Or did they just remove most of those mobs in Cata?
---
For that server.
---
Doesn't affect all servers.
---
It'll be hard to have 3 of those since first of all, you don't know if there will even be 3 layers on one server, and second of all, layers will be gone before world buffs are a thing.
---
I know it doesn't seem like a big deal or anything, but this is just further evidence of how Layering is effecting the state of play on the Beta server.
---
There has been more and more videos each day showing how it is detrimental to the immersion of Classic WoW. And it will negatively affect gameplay in the long run. 
---
It's also a serious issue in terms of exploiting the server using Layering. Such as swapping layers to avoid players (which I guess is a possible scenario in this video) or swapping layers like Venruki did to get the Gurubashi Arena chest from a 'dead' layer. 
---
I'll agree, the title says 'raid', it didn't seem like a raid. None the less, I still think it's important.
---
Lol fuck no.
---
Was already essentially no chance when you opted in.
---
Weaker compared to equally skilled and geared warriors. You should still be able to tank 5 mans with consecration. A warrior has however more skills geared to this same as druid. 
---
In the end it depends on how hard it is to find a willing tank. 
---
A fully prot skilled paladin with fitting gear however is of course better then some fresh 60 warrior.
---
Main things you need to keep in mind:
---
You need something to pull: 
---
Holy Shock, Grenades, or Linkens Boomerang
---
My prefered solution for non-engineers and cheapskate engineers:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6714/ez-thro-dynamite
---
You need something to taunt:
---
BoP on targets target
---
Mana management:
---
Either frequent drinking, lower your threat for mana seals, mana pots
---
If Protpaladins AOE tanking is better then warrior is something where the jury is still out. Skarm showed that a warrior has no issues there and could be even better then paladin but this relies on threatmechanics that where only explored on private server.

I have a friend that streams with a pretty decent community, we managed to build one of the largest French Destiny 2 community (2 full clans), he's super hyped as well and we're gonna try to create a large raiding guild too. 
---
I'm quitting my job on August 23rd and plan to take a few months break from work.
---
I grew up, finished my studies, worked for a few years. Now I got time to play and money to play on something better than a wired potato.
---
I'm gonna be damn viable my man.
---
They might aswell just model-edit swastykas on their tabards
---
I spam all dungeons while leveling to get gear and level up engineering so I can world-pvp effectively.
---
Roaming the shimmering flats at 32 and killing everyone as a warrior is fun as fuck.
---
I really enjoy semi-twinking like that. Maybe afford a fiery weapon enchant and some low level rage potions and stuff.
---
Why is his 32-43 that awful if you don't mind me asking?
---
&gt;cost to develop the layering tech was higher than it would have cost to just have extra servers at launch
---
Did you really buy into the "we've developed a new system from scratch" bs? It's obvious with how it has worked on beta that layering is just reverse engineered from the sharding system
---
The reason why people don't like paladin tanks is the fact that they constantly have to play around the fact that their tank is a paladin. 
---
No taunt = moderate DPS. 
---
Mana as a source = constant drinking
---
Well, you have 74 days to find a guild as dedicated as you and build that support network!
---
&gt;but I suspect it will go well past the mega inflow expected. Perhaps up to be a perma thing.
---
The tinfoil hats on this sub is fucking hilarious at times.
---
they've already gone back on their word several times (no phasing/sharding AT ALL - &gt; sharding but only in starter zones for two weeks - &gt; layering the whole world but 'only' phase 1 at most) and yet people defend it and rationalize it every time and say there's no slippery slope
---
Uh efficient is quicker than that, if you are a guild pushing for world first you'll have some bis by day 10 and ready to raid - I see Rag being dropped somewhere within 12 days
---
I think certain zones need it, like The Barrens, and Westfall. But anywhere that a competitive advantage can be gained, or the market can be manipulated (Devilsaurs/Lotus), should absolutely be layer free.
---
Former. I think blizzard reasoned it saying it makes grouping less discouraging.
---
It was always bullshit, and we need to continue calling it out. The more the community complains about this, the more likely Blizzard will react.
---
Definitely not. If anything, almost the entire subreddit was complaining about layering from day one without know all the details about it.
---
This is just circlejerking at it's finest.
---
King Bangalash was my first Pet that was a rare. I got him during vanilla and still had him with me til the day I quit playing about a year ago. He and I went through some shit... the unexpected feels man.
---
how exactly do you think a server community will ever be formed on a 15k layered server?
---
Woot
---
Ah yes, that’s true. I guess I don’t mind defending too much - but thanks for pointing that out.
---
Hahah, this is such a non-issue.
---
delusional boomers on this sub strike again
---
the funny thing is even with layering launch is gonna be hectic and there will be queues
---
Help!
---
 I have leveld 6 or 7 warriors to 60 on pservers and my main back in 04-07 was a human fury warrior. This time around im going horde with my friends and that Orc warrior looking real juicy. But...
---
I tend to burn myself our on these warriors. I never stayed long enough to get deep into raiding on either one of my pserver warriors. Completed BWL at best and sometimes I quit progressing into MC. 
---
Should I pick another class? Thing is I really love the theatric of a Metal Warrior, smacking these two handers while listeing to Manowar. Its just my style. I really love 2h fury. 
---
I am leaning towards a different appraoch, what if I where to play mage instead?
---
It's blizzard. Never underestimate their stupidity.
---
I’m a simple man. I see Classic WoW, I vote up.
---
This is amazing. Also you can see which streamers are fine with it and actually even laugh, and then there are streamers I won't name who bitch about this 24/7 because they're getting ganked on a PvP server, that's a terrible thing of course. 
---
If they don't like it, it's not like there's a option for them to play on something called PvE server, right?
---
Remember this is Classic, not Vanilla - "no changes are impossible"
---
Stupid fucking blizzard wanting to let everyone in at the same time instead of letting us morons join 10 hour queues and realize you won't get to play until the next day.
---
The point he's making is that 6k&gt;vanilla server cap and if they don't have layering after p2 starts then they'll have to put &gt;50% of the server in a que.
---
Thanks for advice. I agree, I don’t want to choose a class just because it pairs well with my friends choice, just wondering if there was any synergy whatsoever between Warlock and Warrior I was unaware of.
---
Ultimately, I’ll change my mind a dozen times between now and launch.
---
Can't PUG KZ is my favourite Warcraft song parody
---
I kind of love that they're making a pvp video of themselves without recording it from their own pov. This is actually pretty good content.
---
Of course druids are needed. They have battle res among other things
---
The spawn rate is bugged too. There probably won't be a line there in Classic. At most a group of 2-3 people. With 15k players though there would definitely be a line.
---
I'd rather have that until phase 2 than the servers being completely dead by then once the tourists leave.
---
&gt; you never see the final boss killed in the first week.
---
*cough* xavius *cough*
---
Go watch old hunter PvP like Zibba
---
Yet they keep on saying "The entire world is layered" I don't get why people aren't understanding that layering is nothing but world wide sharding...
---
They are not going to "layer" sub 20 zones. They can't... because that's sharding and they aren't using sharding in classic.... right??
---
needs to be gone before launch
---
Hydra will have leveling guide for alliance before launch, he has been speed leveling priests and trying best routes
---
Nah, got my bubble and hearthstone ready. 
---
... to report back to base.
---
Wtf is this logic.
---
OH ASMON PLAYS HORDE SO NO ONE WORLD WIDE WILL PLAY ALLY
---
Good one.
---
But v limited raid slots right?
---
This is conjecture at best.
---
Hardcore players will reach level 60 within 4-5 days /played. Won't take long until MC is down after that.
---
&gt;"One of the tenets of Classic WoW is none of the cross-server realms and different [server] sharding options that we have available to us today. There’s a lot of desire on part of the community that this is something that they don’t want."
---
https://www.pcgamer.com/this-is-how-blizzard-plans-to-finally-bring-back-vanilla-wow-servers/
---
Well they sure went back on that "tenet" pretty quick. Sure it isn't Ion but still the vice president of Blizzard. There's no reason to believe they can't or won't change their mind again.
---
Ohh this brings back memories!
---
There will almost definitely be at least one oce server I imagine. Ideally we probably get a pvp and a pve, but I don't think we have the population to justify splitting it up any further like it is on retail.
---
Mainly because he doesn't do any Scarlet Monastery or RFK. 5 hours in Desolace, 10 hours in STV, 3 hours in Arathi, 3.5 hours in Dustwallow, 3 hours in Badlands, 3 hours in Swamp of Sorrows. And those are just the big ones and these zones are often broken up into multiple segments, creating a lot of travel time. His guide goes to STV 5 different times, mostly from different continents!
---
There's a reason every streamer just farmed SM from 30 to 40. And yeah, they were twinked like crazy, but even without it, it's still way more efficient than Joana.
---
Torn between human paladin/mage, human/gnome mage or orc/troll shaman.
---
Its gonna be a boring couple o days.
---
Blizzard are not psychic - they have no way to accurately predict population evolution over the first six weeks, say. Imagine you play on a server that started with 20k players, but after the six weeks drops to only 12k. 
---
Blizz: "Oops. Thought you guys would get sick of it sooner. Can't make you play on a 12k server with the crazy world PvP that's about to happen in p2 with the honor system added. So let's keep the layers for now, huh? Best solution for everyone. Sorry."
---
blizzard can do no wrong for many on this subreddit, which is funny because the only reason this exists is because they've been doing wrong for like the last decade
---
Joanas old record is 4 days and 20 hours and he's expecting that sub 4 days runs will be possible once you master his guide. Most tryhards will probably reach 60 within 5 days and 10 hours.
---
I never claimed they developed it from scratch. It did take time and resources to develop though.
---
This, honestly. If after this, Blizzard doesn't make changes to the system, and fast, there will, and should be massive backlash.
---
Here is a suggestion. Make all mining nodes, herbs, chests and rare mobs (except in instances) totally unclickable/unlootable for say 30min after a player last was on a different layer if you have managed to switch layer (either by grouping or relogging).
---
I think he says in English that he just joined a party of night elves and are going to explore the tower of Azora together. 
---
I could be wrong though, haven't seen the episode in years
---
Thats just... not true. Its more for server stability than anything
---
It seems you have some mental issues, maybe playing wow classic is not for you.
---
This issue made me super sad trying to push anything above 2.2k rating on retail, going against teams with significantly lower latency than us in Australia was punishing to say the least. 
---
At the end of the day I do understand why this is, because I would rather have my bg/arena queue pop within a certain amount of time, and play with the American BG, over the other choice, which was to sit on queue and never have one pop because of the lack of Oceanic players queuing 
---
That said, sometimes it felt like even if oceanic players were playing, it would for whatever reason still throw us into an American battle group. It puzzled me a bit sometimes.
---
I'd call that maybe semi hardcore, but definitely not casual. Casual for me is someone, who plays maybe every other day, not every free minute he has.
---
For many people, 4 hours a day is pretty much all your free time when you have a job, thats not casual.
---
Shouldn't it be on your lower back?
---
Hi Gummy
---
1 week max im done giving layering / CC systems a chance when a simple party invite is all it needs to exploit
---
Nice vids!
---
He be right tho.
---
*NEW retail players. Plenty of people still play retail, but support, and want classic back, having played it before, and knowing full well it's a completely different game.
---
Paladins don’t have taunt but if the party allows the tank to build initial threat, that shouldn’t be an issue. The problem is that people don’t understand how paladins build threat. Consecration aside, they build threat by getting hit, not by hitting. The party needs to allow the Paladin to pull unless the Paladin asks them to pull. The reason paladins run out of mana is because they’re having to fight their party for initial threat and expend all their mana doing so. There’s no reason why a Paladin tank can’t be at 75% mana after a fight if the party is adopting a Paladin tank mindset. 
---
If you’re mainly going to be doing dungeons with friends and guild mates that are prepared to adapt their play style to get the best out of their tank, then go for it. If you’re mainly going to be pugging, then Paladin tanking can be very frustrating.
---
I was watching a video and the guy was saying that one of prot paladins biggest problems is that people try and gear them like a warrior and like you say you absolutely need to get some gear with int/mp5 and a bit of Spell power which takes away from defensive stats.
---
It may not have had max bite or claw, so it's dps was lower, but it still had the 1.0 attack speed + claws and bites going off so it was just as effective at interrupting casting
---
Sounds like the mods on r/WoW
---
That's great for reaching endgame fast but then it's not doable solo. Can't compare leveling solo from 1-60 in 4 days and 20 hours to having a team remove much of the traveling etc
---
Imagine thinking layering for a couple weeks permanently ruins the game. Stop being so dramatic.
---
Much wow , such foresight . You're one of the "i prefer broken economy" crowd i guess.
---
I’m actually really interested in watching some classic BGs. I don’t follow any WoW streamers on twitch, who could i watch without getting cancer?
---
The goal is a week one Ragnaros kill. We don't give a shit about getting to 60 "solo".
---
Did you see how people responded to the stress test queues? There were people frothing at the mouth because they couldn't log on during a stress test. Blizz will get a ridiculous backlash no matter how they handle the launch window. At least this way lets people play the game.
---
Is there any comparison on the duel tournament that happened?  I only watched part of it but heard at least a few private server players were participating and obviously retail players(streamers).  How did they do respectively or were there not enough private server players on horde (most went alliance?)?
---
what exactly did he confirm? source?
---
Yes but what about ST, BRD, Mara, Gnomer, etc...
---
Private servers? I imagine they may change this specific droprate....
---
Otherwise Jesus fuck
---
Because every region needs several types of realms. Pve, PvP at minimum and probably rp-pve and they're still considering rp-pvp. It's not going to happen just for Taiwan. The entire reason layering exists is because blizzard is aware population is going to heavily diminish over time. Then you'd have no people on any of those realms, and the fewer each realm has, the more will stop playing because it's dead.
---
Oceanic servers are not even a given, everybody is asking if blizzard is going to have them. There's enough doubt on this, that Taiwan with such a lower potential population is in a much more tenuous position.
---
Consider EU servers of all 4 types and multiplied by languages, too. It's way too much splitting population for what blizzard is aiming for with layering. We are going to see much fewer realm names in the list, but each one is going to grow large early and taper off soon after.
---
Do not expect anything that isn't NA/EU and maybe one OCE if that.
---
I loved the immersion and suspense of a RP-PVP realm. I’ll be really bummed out if they don’t bring those back.
---
I distinctly remember running through Strangletorn Vale on my level 34 dwarf paladin and fearing &lt;The Second Gurubashi Empire&gt;, a troll only guild, was patrolling the main road as they usually did. Before I knew it, I saw three trolls on their impressive raptor mounts, strawlin' at walking speed. The moment they saw me, they rushed head on towards me. I had nowhere to go.
---
After they've killed me a couple of times, I got fed up and called in the help of my dwarven brethren of &lt;The Dwarven Rifle Squad&gt;. I still remember the glorious sight of those small bastards on their rams rushing over the hilltop to come to my aid.
---
You just don’t get these situations on either PvP or RP realms… You distinctly need RP-PvP
---
Please blizzard, give us a RP-PvP realm (preferably at launch)!
---
The hard part is finding that on plate and mail early which you need for tanking
---
I doubt they’re going to put the time and effort into both tbh, that seems optimistic (though I’d be glad if they did)
---
Check out Platinum wow, he has a great vid on priest (as well as other vanilla content)
---
We're taking action against the very real threat of streamers and shaping the server we want. A baby can't do that.

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c02xhw/what_are_you_going_to_main_on_launchstrawpoll/). 
---
For levelling, I wouldn’t use CoA at all. The mob will die before it’s full duration and the mana spent on the final ticks will be wasted.
---
So the people playing it are like stupid animals?
---
Well they actually get to know wtf the team is doing
---
I mean that was never nerfed though?
---
he cant appreciate the fun :/
---
You will get enough linen cloth but after that you will have to farm more and more or buy. Enchanting requires specific playstyle and determination. If you want to sell enchans you will need rare enchants quickly and then raid enchants also ASAP. If not you won't sell much if at all. Other thing is disenchanting - lvl5 alt can DE any BoE so having it on your main would imply DE farmed BoP gear, like a sort of large brilliant shard farm. Compared to this alchemy sells mid to high level pots even after naxx and 99% of it isn't gated that much.
---
The real secret is that's just you.
---
41 doesn’t take that long for the hardcore players that will farm this. It will probably be heavily contested by day 2.
---
Without dying is probably impossible unless you get a high level to escort you or have friends in IF/SW who can find and fund a Warlock for you.
---
If you show me a clip of Joana saying that, then I'll break down why he's wrong. Until then, I just won't believe you.
---
He said he was a tight follower of D&amp;T. Upon clarifying it turns out he watched the WCM movies twice a year. That’s tight following for sure.
---
I both agree, and disagree.I don't mind layering UNLESS it give competitive advantages, and/or affect the market. This isn't a case of "not working as intended." This is exactly what they said was going to be possible, "If a friend from a different layer invites you, you'll be moved to their Layer." We all knew it would eventually be exploited in just this fashion. If Blizzard DIDN'T see this coming, they're shortsighted, and the project will fail. As of right now it's exploitable. Blizzard needs to adjust the system's parameters, and fast.
---
Yeah I laughed at that too, it clearly doesn't count the lack of downtime due to Life Tap and Siphon/Drain Life.
---
In vanilla I basically leveled 50-60 by grinding Felcloth as both heavy Affliction and SiL/DS and I barely ever had to stop for any other reason than PvP and levels just flew by.
---
Noice! Link to artist please.
---
Skinning with autoloot in classic feels especially bad.
---
It takes so long for you to know if you actually succeeded, sometimes you can even just walk away and get the loot while running... or fail, so you have to run back to the corpse.
---
Nah, but my point is: I like the game the way it used to be. I dont want new content to those servers, because lets face it - If you add new items, the meta will change again. And the gap between newly dinged 60 vs. hardcore raider will be even larger. That means, for casual players like myself, i wont stand a chance vs. someone with ashbringer or just hand of raggy :) 
---
But as i said, thats just my point of view. If the community wants new content, it will (hopefully) be added - I just hope its on "new classic servers", so the casual guys like me can play on the non-new content servers :)
---
Except if you are skinning a mob and you have a chance to fail.
---
Then it's the most frustrating thing.
---
The mods here aren't any better
---
Damn man, great advice! Cheers a lot!
---
When working I’m using rhythm of 25mins high focus - 5mins off and every 4 periods I take longer 15 minutes break. I think I’ll use that rhythm as a base from which I’ll start developing it.
---
And yes for the first couple hours of launch I think I’ll be just playing as minutes matter in getting ahead of everyone and making the leveling more enjoyable. But after that, when getting to around level 15 I can ease it up a lot.
---
He seems mad.
---
Most probably hunter. :) 
---
I’ve never played one too much, I find it interesting and well the leveling is just so easy with hunter
---
Samophlange Manual Pages, hello?!
---
You'd need to transfer some people playing on the old layer to the new layer when opening up another one, surely?
---
Say, it's 5pm, people start logging on, server's like, better open a new layer. Let's split the old layer in half so the new one's not completely empty, don't want that. Hmm. All those people in capital cities, no problem. Oh wait, that one guy just started distributing mage water, and the other one just handed over enchanting mats to a third guy, crap. This guy's doing an escort quest, no good. This guy's in a cave, better leave him be. This guy just looted a Black Lotus, he's locked to this layer. This guy's been kiting Hogger for hours, fuck that guy, he goes over.
---
And priests.
---
No phasing is completely different from sharding or CRZ or layering for that matter. If you're going to dislike it at least try to understand the technology beforehand.
---
The box on the boat had it too
---
I had the same issue, and your comment made me pick mage.
---
Thank you :D
---
Jump into the World of Warcraft twitch channel and have a browse buddy, each to there own in terms of what streamers you enjoy. 
---
I've found in terms of PvP players like Cdew, Ziqo, Venruki, Kala, Swifty, Snutz, Kala or Kargoz seem to be playing a ton of PvP when they stream. They are also very experienced PvP players (from retail) and are usually okay to watch, there's rarely much drama or bullshit. It's just a bunch of friends playing WoW together. 
---
I'm sure ive left some names out, there are thousands of people who stream WoW and a ton are streaming Classic Beta.
---
This is where I’m at with Layering. Blizzard has already stated that Layers + Phase 2 (world dragons) is a non starter for obvious reasons. So what are they going to do about servers pops that can’t settle like Sodapoppins or Asmongolds servers?
---
My half baked solution to that would be for Blizzard to introduce voluntary realm transfers prior to Phase 2, just like back in the day. Or server splits?
---
&gt; Saw the post earlier today with the leveling talent calculator in it and really realized how much had been taken away and it's actually got me kind of excited.
---
Which post? :)
---
I moved my character next to SM, did a little pickpocketing round around cathedral and pickpockets seemed to "respawn" really fast. I will do extensive test today or tomorrow. ( worn junk boxes 70 LP required to open, no rogue pages, lots of blind dust, healing pots). I will do test and write everything.
---
For priest the most popular best in slot list value the stats like this (for pve):
---
Heal = 1
---
Spirit = 1.18 (with 3 pieces of T2)
---
Int = 0.435
---
Mp5 = 3.5
---
Crit = 8
---
I find this to be quite accurate for most players. Your personal playing style will how ever change these values. Someone that is good at playing outside of the 5s rule should value spirit higher. Someone that uses Flash heal alot should value INT and Mp5 higher.
---
It was 5 years ago and Riot backed down hard from that requirement when the LCS contract was leaked. Now you just can't accept sponsorships from the companies that make the games on the list. And yes, all Blizzard games are on that list.
---
You don’t understand layering then. Turning it off in three days would be absolutely catastrophic. Instead of having a server capacity’s population, you’d have 2-10 times that. You think getting a quest mob is tough when competing with 400 people? Imagine doing it competing with 4000. 
---
The solution isn’t to turn off layering. The solution is to remove layering and add more servers. To remedy low pop servers post launch, just explain that until deemed unnecessary, the two lowest pop servers will merge together into a 3rd new server, all characters automatically transfer, reserve your name 7 days early. 
---
Removing layering 3 days post launch is worse than having layering in.
---
Can quest items that are not raid specific drop while in a raid?  I don’t think they can.
---
A lot?
---
No. I would love to wake up in the morning and read a newspaper article about how classic wow killed someone. That would be so cool, and would bring back nostalgia of when video game addiction was something you'd see stories about on TV.
---
Realistically though this will just stop account sharers.

I’ll check them out, is there anyone in particular I should avoid?

Why does it make sense to have layering for launch? It makes no sense to have layering. Period. It’s a way to cut costs. Period.

Doesn’t classic come with the retail subscription?

Well, paladins focus on it because it saves mana.

Prot paladin leveling -
---
You need a mix of gearing like a tank and gearing like a holy paladin
---
With spell damage cloak and main hand weap but a tanking shield
---
Your great for dungeons
---
Bad for raid bosses
---
Leveling as a prot pally is all about aoe grinding
---
Kind of like the melee version of a frost mage
---
Theyre great for the last 3 to 4 levels when all your doing is mob grinding in EPL for rep and leveling (youll run out of quests around 56)
---
Your only pvp issues are going to be ranged mostly. 
---
But no melee can touch you.
---
The real jokr here is that they'd fail rven if they tried
---
I can't wrap my head around how people still defend Blizzard /  activision* ftfy
---
Layering should be only happening if you are inside inn, no outdoors. This way you would need to HS to inn, join your friend group (layer switch happens) and you could either walk to your friend or get a summon.
---
Only this one and a few others.
---
10-15k on prime time? If you think that’s fun, good for you. The vast majority of the playerbase would agree that’s an insane amount of players for one server. And using pservers to justify this is ridiculous as they had no prime time because they were used world wide
---
If all the existing servers are high pop after a few months, they will need to add fresh servers to accomodate new players joining.
---
Of course, there is no guarantee this will be the case, which may have been your point.
---
I personally don't like a few streams for my own reasons, don't let anyone tell you what not to like friend.
---
As far as I know the initial start quest that spreads into the rest of the starting zone can only be started by the race the spawns there.
---
My guess is it's the druid healing form.
---
 Tree + healer = treeler
---
Siege has been out for 4 years and the sweaty / toxic fanbase pushes away newcomers consistently, it has no fresh blood and hasn’t for a long time. HoTS has literally been killed by its developers. PuBG is completely overshadowed by Apex / Fortnite fo the point I can’t even find a lobby in my country. 
---
I literally haven’t heard shit about H1Z1 in years because it was an awful game. WoW is a catastrophe and has been for years.
---
You may play some of these games, but you’d be hard-pressed to convince me any of these games aren’t dead or close to it.
---
Battlegrounds are about objectives, not kills. Increasing the honour for kills would only encourage midfield farming.
---
Don't do this if any of your early class abilities like pets or stances/forms are locked behind a class quest. They will not be available in the other race's starting zone.
---
Hi Dave, what's up man?
---
This video proves absolutely nothing.
---
God, imagine having non black-white opinions and the concept of nuance right?
---
Not bad for exploring certain economies, but this wouldn’t change the other massive issues that are more damaging to the game is your server population doesn’t level to a reasonable number.
---
You're not wrong lol
---
While you're correct that layering is indeed bad for the devilsaur mafia, that doesn't mean saturating the market with devilsaur leather is actually good for the game.
---
Just because a bad system as one up side, doesn't make it a good system
---
I leveled a rogue 1-47 without any poison because I had no idea they were thing.
---
Missed opportunity to use [Hooked On A Feeling!](https://youtu.be/NrI-UBIB8Jk)
---
So it's not that they can't stream it.  
---
It's that they won't unless they can get paid from it.
---
Oh look, another guy who thinks layering is the same thing as sharding, and essentially has no clue what he’s talking about. Imagine my surprise!
---
It's like saying, you can't be opposed to the death penalty without understanding the physiological effects of the lethal injection. Like, fuck no. I can see it's wrong.

Oops, this is embarrassing. Don't you look stupid.

if you still play wow you can go ahead on 13th of august (iirc) and secure that name for your list.

We were told an alliance raid was in ratchet and when we went no alliance. We could see them on another stream with no horde.. as soon as I did this I couldn’t see my raid mates (that I left) but could see alliance.
---
Ahh I'd remembered the AV was 51-60 but had forgotten WSG/AB was 1-59, thought they were all the same :)
---
I haven't really played retail (and definitely not alliance) since wrath. Did they...did they really get rid of Darnassus?
---
It makes more sense for your friend to join you rather than you joining them. Durotar will be more populated than Mulgore even with layering. Also if your friend is a hunter/warrior there's a nice two handed axe from an early reward in Mulgore.
---
I'm forever lost in UC but it is by far the coolest city in my opinion.
---
Blizzard doesn't give a fuck. They care about server stability during phase 1. If you have such a big problem with layering then play the game at the start of phase 2.

Streamers get paid through subs and donations far more often than they get paid by the game’s creator.
---
That is indeed all that has been confirmed.  
---
The exact wording was:
---
"There will never be layering after Phase 1, period."
---
I'm honestly okay with that if it means a good launch experience, but I do wonder how else the system will be abused before the end.
---
That’s assuming they all play on the same server.
---
&gt; Yeah? Saturated devilsaur market?
---
Yeah, let's just make the rare things not rare. Necessity to spend few k on Edgemaster's is ridiculous too.
---
You don’t understand layering if you think it’ll make your questing any easier.
---
Just play what you want and don’t worry about it. There’ll be more than enough dwarf priests around to cover the few times fear ward is actually a benefit. No raid needs six dwarf priests.
---
So like an usual summer?
---
Back in school we didnt really go outside, and literally played 3 months in a row, without seeing sunlight. and sleeping maximum 8 hours a day.
---
I doubt they can choose specific zones to phase or level.  Every bit of evidence I see leads to the tech only being on or off in the entire server.
---
I can only imagine that sort of a solution might just be impossible.
---
As someone who plays on North-male, 10k cap is WAY too high. The average players on North-male is around 7.5k. Lowest ive seen past month being 6.5k highest over 10k. Every single quest location is bottlenecked. Literally every one. Each quest can take upwards of 20 minutes to an hour, depending on how bottlenecked it is. 
---
Server caps of 5k would be realistic. Anything higher and you end up like North-male. Where your time to level can be up to twice as long as regular population servers (&lt;5k).
---
next to the badlands and burning steppes in the southern eastern kingdoms
---
It is not a question. I just posted a video-guide on how to do it, so not impossible nor hard just tricky.
---
Are you opted in to the beta test and subscribed to WoW? That’ll be your only prayer of getting in, but it’s certainly not guaranteed. Your likelihood of getting an invite will slightly increase if you’re using lower-end and/or uncommon hardware as they need to test performance on these systems.
---
As I said, I have no input on layering being good/bad, just the faulty assumption that this will benefit the mafia when in fact it's the opposite.
---
This is what Blizzard should use Layering for. Compile all the creepy metadata they have on people and get potential friends to run into each other.
---
you could have a quest to go there from the nights watch in duskwood
---
There is literally no way that after a few months There is more people then on launch.
---
while I did the opposite, I remembered WSG/AB being 10-19 20-29 30-39 40-49 50-59 60 and deduced AV must have been 51-59 and 60
---
Makes sense. 
---
Enchanting I wouldn't like to drop as I have a specific dungeon farming method in mind I did back then which was fairly profitable even after AQ was released. So it's more about Tailoring which I'm worried about. I know it can craft some decent stuff and mooncloth cd will give some steady gold even if not much. But Alch without Herb seems to be a bit to risky because I would be limited to AH buyouts. So maybe Herb together with Ench which seems to be an odd combo sadly.
---
The video analyzing pserver vs. the classic beta that is currently on the front page of this sub, claims that quest items that spawn in the world have near instant respawn in classic beta. In their analysis it looked like the only quests to really avoid during the zerg on the ones that require you to loot items from mobs. The rest should respawn fast enough to be worth it.
---
hahaha true, though if you attempt to outrun a crocodile before 12-15 your will most likely run with little luck, so this is a good method for even a level 1 that'd get one-two shotted.
---
I'm almost suspect of this. It just seems all too coincidental. I mean, I'm aware of regions and such, but... this was just something else.
---
I've run into many other people in online games who happen to be from my city, or live there. But, I think what gets me the most about this, was that I was ALSO the rogue who gave him the schematic a few days ago, unknowingly to the both of us... until now.
---
Ya strong agree with your retail experience, was very similar to mine :(
---
If we were in our own battlegroup with the matchmaker set in such a way that it only popped local matches during peak, but expanded scope to NA during off I wonder how that'd go. 
---
Probably wanting too much at this point idk, dynamic queue of sorts might fk with ranking and shit.
---
Not possible on PVP servers.
---
But the more layers the more people they need to recruit to guard the dinosaurs as well as coordination between layers. It will 100% be worse for the mafia with layers compared to normal.
---
Probably a paladin
---
This is gold.
---
We are making too many assumptions based on how long it will be active for. What we saw in the beta is that the vast majority of people quit between a week and a month leaving far lower activity. This is the time frame is when I believe layering will be used for and eventually switched off when players spread throughout the world, with hardly anyone at max level.
---
That whole scene talking about LotR was fantastic.
---
What's he using to be able to go through the dungeon and show it off?
---
Thanks for the lesson...
---
Now what I mean is, why is mob parry haste worse for paladins than warrior tanks?
---
People combine main + alt or main + friend where main has gated professions (BoP, Raid, mob grind rep) and alt/friend does not. So some will end up with like alch/engi, alch/tailor, alch/ench while having alt or someone to herb/mine (like a druid).
---
Monkeynews, Hydra, Perplexity. Most of the British boys are chill to watch tbh.
---
That part confuses me. You say you advertised the schematic in guild chat. So your rogue and his other character are both in the same guild but your alts are not?
---
I wasn't wrong but still it was a dick move
---
He just gotta wait half an hour and use retaliation every time
---
Now we'll have to consider what server to pick on EU as well to avoid guilds like Method. Streaming and allowing in only people who gonna join them on retail later. Great combo.
---
Sorry for your loss mate, i hope you enjoy wow classic and being able to make a character in honour of your sister! May she forever live on in Azeroth.
---
I keep hearing that pserver populations are toxic but I haven't seen people give examples of what they mean by toxic. Do you mean they're rude to each other in chat or what?
---
I've been playing on one, to about level 35 warrior and met a lot of super friendly nice people. So I'm very curious what to watch out for.
---
BY GODS, I WAS SO STRONG BACK THEN, NED.
---
Correct. They're two very large social guilds, and I just happened to join the other one on my alt. He joined the guild both of our "mains" are in on his alt.
---
This is perfect
---
Happy to teach people but if we try and their response is snarky or "dont tell me how to play" then they're just being selfish and wasting the time of the 4 other people in the group.
---
It’s Sean man, come on
---
When you're running MC and BWL you have one mage spec deep frost to get the winter's chill debuff (assuming you had the slot for it) and every one else went 31/0/20. Alot of the frost tree centers around slowing and frozen targets which is useless in a raid.
---
Hi, /u/Squishydew
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c0369i/which_classes_in_classic_require_pvp_to_get_bis/). 
---
I mean fuck it, just put sharding in the starting zones. This layering shit is gonna end up fucking a lot up in the end.
---
&gt; Retail players literally won't understand why this is bad, unfortunately.
---
Hyperbole doesn't help here. It's immediately obvious why this is a problem. Also there should be technical solutions to this. So unless this actually makes it to release, Im not too worried.
---
IMHO this should not happen after release at all. Layers or not.
---
Besides Mara, those are all way closer to a capital than ZF. The travel time wouldnt be as bad.
---
When do BGs release?
---
Bindings of the Windseeker back in vanilla.  Took me an entire three months to get the other one from Garr.
---
If layering is on for only a couple of weeks at the start, then yes. Sorry for the inconvenience. But hopefully it does get turned off soon.
---
I kept killing mobs for a root drop in NELF start area, not knowing could have gone to Ah
---
There was that really bad post about the coalition of guilds that want to use addons to grief streamers. The post talked about how they will be getting a a first week Ragnaros kill. I'm not saying that can't do that, but if they pull it off they are just playing 24/7 that week? Seems absurd, but I know some people do some crazy shit.
---
That's what he did, got invited by another player and it moved him to group leaders layer. Really stupid.
---
This happened to me back in vanilla. Randomly grouped with a guy in barrens, near those mines towards the south, can't remember the name now. Ended up being in my city, couldn't believe it. We even caught up for food a couple times.
---
Yeah id def do the first small zone solo, only grping to get tag on the boss respawns. or if its really hard to tag mobs, i had a level friend dwarf come to the starting zone with me, totally screewed me up for level 1-10, as i was always way underleved for the mobs we were fighting, was only level 4 in leaving the starting zone. where ideally you want to be level 6 before goldshire.
---
Phase 1 is not “level 20 zones.” Phase one is the first couple months of Classic.
---
That's so crazy. How did you guys end up organizing a meet up? Was it just as simple as saying, "yo, let's meet here for food sometime!"?
---
Nostalgia flair up!
---
Ah the acapella guy
---
If they are a dps upgrade, it is justifiable.
---
&gt; more than a few days?
---
I am in the beta since more than 2 weeks now. I did play a lot considering I do have other things to do atm. Clocked in just over 2 days /played now.
---
Only now do I get into spaces where it's not crowded. Until now, I have only been to:
---
* Tirisfal
---
* Silverpine
---
* Barrens
---
* Stonetalon
---
* Ashenvale
---
* Hillsbrad
---
All of them have so many people playing that you wwould have to wait for mobs to spawn without layering.
---
Considering 10-15 hrs/week and 40-50 hours /played until people disperse, layering is surely there for at least the first month.
---
Mara and ST aren't close at all
---
Why not just give layering the warmode treatment? You have to be in Orgrimar/Stormwind to change layers, it would be a slightly bigger headache for forming groups but would exploits and shit it would only be like that for 2 weeks
---
On my mage i won a greed roll on assasinations blade from SFK, gave it to a whispering rogue for free, did not realize he would just sell on AH.. Did not realize it was worth anything as it was my first character
---
Please continue doing the Lord’s work when classic goes live and cleanse the servers of streamer trash.
---
Removing layering that early would destroy the leveling experience for virtually everybody and would be an insanely bad move. 
---
Imagine a popular server with 6 layers on it;
---
Each layer has 3500 players. 
---
Two weeks later you’re playing on a server that has 21,000 players. Instead of fighting for quest mobs against 500-1000 players, you’re now fighting 10,000 players. This absolutely cannot happen. 
---
Layering should not be implemented. Server caps should be set at 4000. The two lowest pop servers should merge together automatically creating a brand new 3rd server, and all the people who lost their name in the merge can just deal with making a new name. Problem solved.
---
Or you know, watching people being proficient at a game as a mean to improve themselves; or just to entertain themselves watching a game they're really involved with, no need to project your insecurities on others
---
He didn't confirm. There is no source. I have no idea why blizzdrones keep repeating this bullshit "ThEy sAId oNLy A FeW wEEKs"
---
A thousand times this. The type of people that do this don't care about anyone elses opinion in the first place. Also, it's probably worth mentioning that a lot of those people are angsty edgey teens who "fucked your mom".
---
Real advice: Do you- if people are toxic, mute them.
---
Yea, I'd rather just have it launch without layering. I'll take crashes and queues over layering.
---
I really hate how much their server architecture has regressed.
---
You too can *be* your character! Roll RP today!
---
K E K*
---
This assertion requires further explanation and evidence.
---
Awww dude 4 strenght 4 stamina leather belt AAUUUGH
---
ST is right by Undercity. I already said Mara wasnt near a capital.
---
classic rap: bfa in short
---
&gt; I'd also take the claims of it being temporary with a huge grain of salt, there is absolutely no way to guarantee that your server concurrency will "magically" settle to ~3k by phase 2 so you can have a 2006-like pop on a single layer for all servers.
---
The point of it is to mitigate the effects of a rapid drop in population once the tourists leave. If there is no rapid drop in population, it means that Classic's long-term popularity is higher than they expected. If this is the case, they can just do the exact same thing they did the last time vanilla WoW's popularity exceeded their expectations (that is, the actual launch of the game) and open new servers.
---
A decent PVP overview, sure. There's zero other content in the AV test.
---
Toez1
---
 Yo Blizzard. hire this guy.
---
Wouldn't that make it sharding? Layering by definition is the whole continent.
---
Locks weren't LOL tier until 2.0 and they always needed to be geared
---
How about we throw layering out of the window and never talk about it ever again
---
Which classes in classic require PvP to get BiS gear?  
---
I'm not much of a PvPer and it'll probably weight heavily into my decision.  
---
I want to play almost every class so I've just made a pros and con list to see if it changes my opinion.. Kinda hard to do though, i only ever got to Level 40 in classic so I'm not exactly well informed.  
---
https://imgur.com/nToi8kK
---
I'm not sure if it will be "heavily contested" by day 2. If you watched streamers most of them didn't get past 20 day 1 and a lot of them took a few days to 30. There will be a few hardcore people who rush to mid or late 30s and go for it, but going for it also means wasting time from leveling, so it might not even be very contested.
---
There are barely any druids so I mean it’s low competition
---
Jed has to be damn rare if 10 people cant find him in 4 reset each...
---
mine was that I didnt know about training new skills or using talent points. My bro was big on wow, and got me playing. He was a level 60 Pally when I started. I played for 1 hour on a new char on his account and loved it, so then went out and got the game for myself the next day. I was nearly level 14, hunter, and was still running about with the original skills and just shooting stuff! loved it. But seeing I could train more skills and use talent points was a huge noooooob moment for me! haha
---
so you tell me your opinion and call it theorycrafting.
---
if you wanna check you can just go on legacylogs and compare the dps. i dunno where you get your data from.
---
shadowpriests scaling is just trash, since spelldmg upgrades arent as big after getting full bwl gear, since you dont scale well with crit.
---
 [https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Ranking/Default.aspx](https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Ranking/Default.aspx) 
---
check bwl, compare priests with mages. since the mobs are fireimmune you cant just blame it on ignite, like you could in aq/naxx.
---
Overrated underrated thanking
---
Josh has become unbearable recently it's like I'm watching someone slowly lose their mind to provide "quality content".
---
That's the dream! Never have had real chance to experience that myself, now it's my time. Altough with a bit updated version of that.
---
No this is layering, sharding is small pockets of instances throughout the game world, layering is an entire continent.
---
Ultimately whichever you want. In terms of overall potential dps the gnome has the edge due to the intelligence but it’s very minuscule.
---
Well.. Yeah how else is blizzard supposed to test it and find these issues?
---
Look here young boy there’s #layers to this shit
---
Yeah I gotta agree with this. I think Mage will be the best fit for you.
---
Well first they indicated previously it'll be more like 10-11k.
---
And then it slightly comes down to the implementation of how they pick which layer to put you on, and/or load-balancing the layers.
---
They implied before it'll be something like a first-come-first-served basis, with some emphasis on you being 'tagged' with an original layer when you first make you character.
---
Now if it's along those lines, the result will be the people playing the most will be highly disproportionately grouped into the first layer, and then drop-off in % share as the layers increase.
---
So this means, in theory, the more dedicated a player you are (and the more likely you are to stick around long-term) the more likely you are to be grouped with other similar people.
---
This means the long-term players should still form communities naturally, and then when the layers are removed, there should be 1-2 large tight communities added together.
---
------------
---
That's the best-case scenario.
---
If we assume it's completely random, and make no assumptions about numbers of layers, then it would go along these lines:
---
Every layer has the same % distribution of all kinds of players, and once the layers are removed there are X number of communities of 3500 * %-long-term-players added together. Where X is average number of layers there was.
---
This is the worst-case/generalised scenario.
---
So then the community cohesion is mostly based on what the % distribution is between long-term players and "tourists".
---
If long-term players are ~50% of the players, and both factions are ~50%, then that means the long-term players have a community of ~875 people on their side while the layers are active.
---
And then ~875 * 3-to-5 communities to gel together once they're removed.
---

---
dont think its possible to test as its purely random.  I raided 2-3 times a week back in vanilla, yet never ever did get my T2 hunter legs from Rags. They Just wouldnt drop. I ran MC so many times, and only saw 2 sets of dragonstalkers drop in all that time, and I didnt get them. I got all other pcs and also majority of T2.5, but no DS legs!!!   Same with trying for the Bone slicing hatchets. Got my 1st one early, and then had to do about 20 Strath runs for the 2nd one!
---
"Hey friend, want to group up and do this group quest?" "Sure inv me!" "Oh I can't see you, we must be locked on different layers." Sounds like fun.
---
So what? It's instanced areas. There are people on your own server you can't see because they are on another "shard" whatever you say it's sharding.
---
Sunken Temple
---
You can still chat ofc, you're on the same server.
---
Will still be a mafia only they'll be banking the leather until phase 2 when the mainstream/causal players are hitting 60. Queue tears about no lifers getting unfair advantage.
---
This goes for herbs, thorium etc too. There's a massive economic incentive to get in ahead of the market because there will be less completion (fewer 60s) for more supply (more shards) in phase 1.
---
Shards need to be locked to starting areas. Think the mat farms for AQ event won't suffer due to hoarding in phase one? Think again.
---
set every spawn on an account cooldown. you can jump layers all you want, but once your account gets flagged, you have to wait the correct timer before you have another opportunity. that way exploiting layers is not particularly beneficial.
---
So much this.
---
Fuck layering, seriously.
---
that's not very good, if you're trying to join a community event and the event is in, say, blasted lands. you would have to go all the way back to a city and then blasted lands in hopes that the layer isn't full on your second attempt to enter it.
---
No point doing that. You all will end up at the X-roads soon anyway, by about level 10-12 (like a few hours). So best to quest where you are and then meet up with them.  
---
Also Mulgore will have 1 race, where as Durotar has orcs/trolls so will be more populated.
---
Well the old system allowed for the variations than the current one, imo. Atm you have several talents that work together and the rest is just sh\*t for spec XYZ. 
---
In classic you can build like 5 different speccs for 1 specialization.
---
For example right now in the beta at lvl 40 you can choose for 3 or 4 diff. specs only for a frost mage. 
---
1. deep frost for pvp with CC/slows
---
2. deep frost for pve without heavy slows
---
3. elemental mix fire/frost (not that good at 40 but viable)
---
4. deep frost with AoE talents (imp. Blizz) for farming or whatever
---
5. (maybe even more)
---
At 60 there are even more variations.
---
In retail you just change 1 talent and thats it. Not really complex. Most of the time there is just 1 talent per row which outshines the other 2. 
---
In classic, almost every talent it good in some way, and if possible, you would take them all. For example 2/0/49 frost specc at lvl60, where you have almost all frosttalents because theyre good.
---
Disappointing that they went that route. Everyone wanted the old AV, not the current shit-AV that we have in retail where people just zerg.   
---
The magic of AV at the time was that it was a long BG and that you could log in and out from it.
---
You're obviously an idiot
---
They have to do something about this. Granted, only in the first few days realms will have 8-10 layers, and after the number of layers will drop, but still, even with 3 active layers, a lot of people will make a fortune with ores and herbs...in the process fucking up the economy and have a massive advantage over other players.
---
Hoping layers should absolutely be dealt with.
---
Hunter has the highest skill ceiling imo and is the class I would recommend. It’s only potential downside is PvR raidspot and dps falloff. But remains too for PvP/wPvP/BG.
---
Quick question about mage
---
I absolutely love the class fantasy of mage as well as their playstyle (I had a mage in TBC and I figured that mage did not receive drastic changes) but I'm afraid of overpopulation.
---
Can it be a real pain in the ass to find groups as a mage?
---
Thanks
---
Not bad, but Mutanus the Devourer is a murloc. You showed Verdan the Everliving.
---
I think you should stick with Warrior. Burning out is something I largely attribute with playing on a pserver, whereas on official server you care more.
---
Sorry for the dumb question, what's layering? That doesn't sound like something from Vanilla back then. Is this a technology they implement in Classic from modern WoW?
---
hey !   
---
Wasn't AnV only formed in BC ? :)  
---
I was part of AnV in BC, so you might remember me?   
---
I was a druid named Hazelminker.  
---
Good times raiding the early content, i got to tank in Karazhan, and did most content with you guys up to The Eye
---
I don't know if you can compare that, PVP in Classic will be different from PVE, PVE will be a sprint race each phase. For example, WF MC will not be about MC itself, but about which guild can get 35-40 ppl leveled and attuned the fastest. And thats where pserver players have a advantage, they will know the leveling process a lot better than the average method player and thats why it will be hard for method to compete there, unless they sign a pserver guild roster to play in the method name.  
---
For the PVP tournament, the top 3 iirc were former Blizzcon World Champions and for all i know, not pserver players. ( Venruki, Snutz and Cdew).
---
I got the ghost saber as a horde hunter, i fucking loved that little guy
---
Oh see I always have called that Temple, I was thinking Strat. But in that case, you could just go to Booty Bay if you need to de-layer in a city. If Booty Bay doesnt count, you just boat/zep back to a main city.
---
Why do they implement this in Classic? To support more players?
---
that's already what they're doing with layers, each is its own server on top of the main server. but in phase 2 they will be less impactful as player distribution will be less congested per area. if they do named servers the principle would be the same, they could just start merging servers in phase2 for a better player distribution. so you're no longer playing on Kazzak or Frostwhisper but Frostwhisper-Kazzak. Or, say, Frostwhisper-Kazzak-Warsong.
---
definitely. But also with two people....you can grind in instances. Instance XP isnt great for groups of 5 compared to solo grinding. But you can easily grind instances, if you have a healer and a tank.  If you are two classes that compliment each other, then grinding would be easy.
---
Leveled a hunter and didn't figure out why my pet always left me until I was ~25
---
Oh god, that looks terrible.
---
Sorry confirmed was definitely the wrong choice of words. Aussie streamer named chinglishtv asked about OCE servers at blizzcon and had it verbally confirmed.

Yarr! That be me favourite location o' the map fer fishin', ye scallywag!
---
First off, thanks for the response.
---
I have come to understand that the BiS is a lot of cloth. But I also mentioned that I will be a filthy casual, so I will probably not be able to grind out every piece of BiS gear that is shared with Priests and Paladins.
---
Hence the question, are the Druid sets any good? I know MC has some decent leather healing drops but from all this BiS talking going on it seems Paladins will want them as well!
---
Can someone eli5 these layers and what is happening here?
---
patch 1.13 here we go!
---
Just play what you want. If doing dungeons is were you will have fun with your budies, as a paladin tank you will do just fine. Paladin's shortcomings come with the lack of gear to mitigate damage from raid bosses, and some mana problems that you can work around.  
---
tldr: paladin tanks are fine for 5mans and are totally playable as a hybrid class
---
Ye it is but idk how widely known that is also like South Park haven’t acknowledged it so maybe they just came up with it by themselves
---
huehue
---
&gt;worst class to level
---
What?.. It's so much easier than other melee classes like warrior, rogue and enhancement that basically have to regenerate after every pull.
---
&gt;All of them have so many people playing that you would have to wait for mobs to spawn without layering
---
Oh no, imagine a world actually being alive /s
---
Yeah, they've already said that layers will be removed by phase 2. This method avoids issues around player/guild names, auction houses etc by having them all combined from the get go.
---
does Int still provides you with faster leveling weapon skill ?
---
In this interconnected world its bound to happen more and more. 6 degress of separation is slowing turning to 5 degrees. In small countries if you play in a national guild, you're almost bound to meet someone who you either know or atleast have common friends with.
---
Are the leveling bg's only closed in beta?
---
I figured there were a few that spend more time pandering to their audience than discussing content and combat
---
buying things from the AH, because it looked cool.  
---
Dindt realy know about stats....  
---
Also on every weapon i had, i bought Demon slayer enchanht... because ... it looked cool...
---
Didnt had much gold when i was around lvl 40...
---
Well, if the same thing can be resolved without buying new hardware I'd prefer that solution. And as of yet I've always found a way around that. My Keyboard is a non-planned-obsolescence A4-tech-keyboard from 2002 that cost 8 €. :D
---
Think we are going to go druid/hunter or druid/warrior
---
This is one of the worst posts I've ever seen on this subreddit. No one in the Classic community gives a fuck about MMO Champion and NO ONE wants politics brought into Classic wow. WTF is this garbage post
---
Are there even enough people in the beta for AV :V?

---
I find Ironforge a bit too boring, lots of wide flat areas and the colour palette is really dull. On the other hand, I love thunder Bluff and darnassus, both feeling very relaxing. Tbh I'm still undecided on druid race, since I love the ne and tauren starting zoned a whole lot too.
---
ctrl+f'd "pubmasters"
---
glad someone else got the homage
---
I did this. Striped naked because of armor and ran trough teldrassil. I died like 10000000 times
---
A server with a non laughable population
---
Traque is streaming too. Arguably the best hunter out there atm.
---
Woaaa calm down mate, i thougt its a funny post (still pretty sure its satire, but whatever) i wanted to share with you and mb bring someone to smile. 
---
Sorry it had the opposite effect on you...
---
do they camp or is it like a kill then they go find someone else and come back a few hours later?
---
There will be 8-10 layers per server at launch. Normal dropout is 50-60% in the first 3-4 months. To get to the Vanilla realm median total population of 10-11,000 people in 3-4 months, you need 8-10 layers of 3k people.
---
At launch, the number of total players = concurrent players. You'd need 4 layers of 3k people each for those 12k people that will stay, but since the droput will be 50-60% in normal conditions (could be more, could be less) you'd need an additional 4-6 layers, for another 12-18k people that will leave in the next 3-4 months.
---
It's not really hard to estimate the number of layers, given that we know that they want Vanilla like population and that the dropout rate will be 50-60% in 3 months, like it was for almost every single MMO in history.
---
There will be 8-10 layers per realm on launch day.
---
not really/ sharding is taking all several realms together and mash low pop realms with high pop realms together based on zone population.
---
layering is just taking a single server and creating copies running them as "sub-servers" and distributing the population between those, to reduce the amount of people in 1 area. you can choose to apply it to 1 zone or several. this is not the definition of the tech but just a use case.
---
when blizz said it will not be zone based, it was to appease everyone's fear that they might be sugarcoating sharding.
---
They couldnt kill perplexity 3v1 lolz, they also accepted money from streamers, wich is intresting because apparently their whole thing is not taking free money.
---
He was just pointing out a desire for great and easy loot (welfare epics) is part of what led to the downfall of WoW. Strongly concur.
---
Be aware if you go Druid/warrior, the Druid will spend a lot of time waiting for the warrior due to their increased move speed, it is much better to have both of you moving at a similar speed. Aspect of the Cheetah/travel form for example.
---
b o o g a
---
I think layering should only be in the game for a week tops. Just so the starter zones aren't absolutely rammed.. but even then, the struggle would be pretty funny
---
Ouch
---
I assumed NPCs would also be layered
---
Gnome mage
---
watching an av that could go for literal days is not the most fun i have ever had ...
---
What's wrong with dwarves bro?
---
I think you're missing his point, it's not a travel time issue, it's actually being able to get into the instance. Getting inside ST is not easy. You probably can't even get inside Deadmines solo.
---
That still makes rare mob loot way more common then usual..
---
Can't wait to log on my gnome and pom pyro your ass
---
How many people in the beta? are they adding people for the AV test?
---
&gt; I don't mind layering UNLESS it give competitive advantages
---
Completely on the same page.
---
&gt; and/or affect the market. 
---
This one is impossible, or very complicated, depending on how you want to define it.
---
On average the market shouldn't be affected because there should be roughly the same amount of resources per player as if there wasn't layering.
---
However you could use friend invites to funnel more resources to a particular person. And you could only prevent this if you added some kind of tag/marker which prevents you from picking the same node on a different layer over some cooldown time.
---
This will be quite niche however, because it mostly doesn't matter whether 3 people get all the tin, or 10 people do, assuming they all know each other, they can just share the money. Or, even without layering, people could have multiple alts logged out in strategic locations, and this is an analogous situation.
---
The biggest potential problem is strategic leveling of professions (i.e. being very far ahead in alchemy level than average because you layer hop for ingredients, or just get fed mats from friends on other layers), or how recipe vendors work.
---
You could potentially lock-down all the recipes on all the vendors on all the layers. But then again, there's roughly the same amount of recipes per person, and you could lock down vendors without layers. So is this a big deal?
---
------
---
**TL;DR** There's clearly issues with the current implementation, but I'm sure it could be fixed with some thought.
---
You mean you need a group that is not braindead and pulls aggro every fight.
---
And no, loosing aggro as prot is not that common, given that salvation, righteous fury and consecration are pretty fantastic to generate threat.
---
I agree, I'd rather put up with login queues than layering tbh.
---
Do you happen to have a source on this? Because if it is true that would be swell! :)
---
Damn that would suck for warlocks not being able to use one of the things that make them more attractive to a group, that being summon.
---
Yes, as I say understanding :) they will need to lose that retail instinct of smashing everything as soon as possible
---
Fuck assmongo. Hes is just an unemployed loser. 
---
Stop looking at him like some kind of wow God. 
---
He should not even be playing. He should focus on getting a real job and get those teeth fixed.
---
&gt; I can't wrap my head around how people still defend sharding / layering 
---
You can't? Try harder.
---
I want Classic to be as successful as possible. This means a proper launch period (where people won't wait 1 hr to kill 10 quest mobs, or gain XP much faster if dynamic respawns) and a stable population long term, without realm merges.
---
The above can ONLY be done with sharding or layering. Layering is the least worse.
---
Any other option is worse than layering.
---
There is NO GOOD OPTION here, only bad options, and layering is the least bad.
---
good catch!! Loved PM 1
---
yeah, there are some vierd ones :P Retaliation and Shield Wall also share a cooldown... a half an hour long one :(
---
So people willing sit there and watch and listen to this hyena play video games?   I do not get it.
---
Thanks to him people don't want to play druid, he is not good at it especially as healer, using wrong spells, gets oom and complain.
---
Idk if it's good or bad at this point
---
I can and only will recommend mage. As a "noob" mage offers so many great tools, easy rotation, utility and with the right gear, you do look amazing! Not Bloodfang amazing, but still very good!   
---
You will be wanted in every dungeon, it's easier to get gold, you wont be stomped in AV by being in melee range, free food/water and the list goes on.   
---
I bloody love mage, and when you are not a "noob" anymore, then it's time to master the mage and raise to become a god amongst the pvp scene.
---
I have been on the Classic server bandwagon since TBC was around, I am super keen to play this but if I am personally going to experience shit like this video - i’m not going to play Classic.
---
this seems closer to retail then Vanilla. It seems eerily familiar to another game wandering around the world and people are teleporting in and out.
---
Meanwhile everyone else got to 60 a month before you
---
When they even said that you can't change your lair? They talked about not changing lair randomly for no reason, like it happens on retail. If you just play the game without entering groups on other lairs than you won't leave your lair, that's the point and not what you imaganing
---
It's 11 hours later, we **need** the picture! :D
---
Yes paladin tanking in dungeons is possible but it will require a bit more effort.
---
that ... that seems like a good idea ... ninja looting will get your ass kicked irl though ... ganking ... hhmmm
---
But it's not, shards are small pockets of players so you have gurubashi arena 1 2 3 and 4 spread out over the entire EU or US servers. Layering is Kalimdor 1 and 2 on one server.
---
Well, I wouldn't, so that's why Blizzard had to find a compromise like layering in the first place.
---
\&gt; FUN DETECTED  
---
\&gt; PERMABANNED
---
N o HA IR
---
I could not have said it better myself.
---
&gt;Atm you have several talents that work together and the rest is just sh\*t for spec XYZ.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;In classic you can build like 5 different speccs for 1 specialization.
---
You are heavily biasing towards vanilla now. The vast majority of specs in vanilla only have one viable PvE build for any given phase and many only have one PvP build with some specs having several (Hunters and Warlocks especially have several version of the same spec for PvP).
---
And fire/frost elemental mix, you are not actually serious, are you? If you include that then you can also include basically *all* possible combinations on retail. You are clearly not talking what is meta, but just what is possible, in which case on retail all combinations are possible, just not best for min/max. And you even include farming builds for vanilla, but why not for retail?
---
Let's look at retail frost mage, just from PvE. You have 7 rows of talents but 16 out of 21 viable talents plus one situational viable. And additionally one of those "non-viable" is used a lot in PvP. That is 18 talents across 7 rows that are *viable*. And since you include stuff like fire/frost hybrid (not actually viable) you can basically include the last 3 retail talents as well. And that is without even mentioning PvP talents.
---
Aside from that in vanilla you also just pick a spec for a given content without thinking, in retail you have to decide based on things like even what *dungeon* to play, and not just that - affixes means even the same dungeon require different builds depending on the *week* you play.
---
And *further* the builds on retail actually makes you play differently. Many builds have directly different rotations and abilities. Vanilla is going to be frostbolt spam no matter how you build your frost mage and in PvP it is a matter of modifiers, doesn't change how a frost mage plays.
---
As I already mentioned, I like vanilla talents for many reasons, but don't try to fool yourself into thinking they are more complex.
---
My very first character in Vanilla was a troll hunter.
---
I had him for a solid 1 hour max?
---
Because I was levelling I’m by a cliff, that went like 50 feet down to some water. I ended up accidentally going off the cliff, doesn’t matter that much right?
---
Well to me it was because I looked around and couldn’t find a way back up, the only one was maybe a 20 minute swim away. So instead of doing what any normal person would do and use my hearthstone. I deleted my level 5 character and made a night elf hunter instead and kept him as my main from Vanilla - Wrath.
---
As I understand it the 1.12 version isn’t the initial version that had such Long games
---
imagine if the other layer is empty? what is the layer cap? I smell abuse.
---
What if it ends up with 500 players?
---
What if other realms end up with 4.500 players?
---
Because this is what will happen to most realms. Only a few will actually stabilize to 2.5k from 5k.
---
Please deliver a solution (that is better for the game, NOT FOR YOU PERSONALLY), other than layering, which will ensure a AAA launch experience and also ensure a healthy population in 3-4 months down the road.
---
While I would like this, I'm ok with the "Warmode treatment" so it cannot be easilly abused, still better than current mess
---
&gt;  classic will be around 2 hours. 
---
- cippopotomas (Reddit, 2019).
---
Yo Blizzard. Hire this guy
---
You have to enter the dungeon first to join their layer, after you exit you are in the same layer. maybe
---
Someone made a longer compilation on youtube with the streamers' reactions:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEfip7OUtac
---
Not sure if there is one already, but I'd be happy to put one together.
---
Shaun Bean can't dye ....
---
you can use a candle to pull which is much better than everything you mentioned.
---
Dude ... I want to join these guys.  This would literally be my endgame
---
Ahh right, I was more in the mind set of what raids released next. But yeah, the tier 4 raids are definitely "next" in that regard. My bad, bad understanding from me :P
---
They originally said this system wouldn’t go beyond lvl 20 zones and completely 180’d on that.
---
Probably fucking cinnamon smell aswell.
---
Dude .. are you in the beta? The world is plenty alive in these zones. I had no trouble finding players for gun drak and had 2 spontaneous groups up in the lordamere internment camp for the quests there.
---
WoW is not a city simulator. Nature should be lonely at times. I ran through desolace today off-hours and saw no one. Was actually refreshing.
---
It will. You get to 30 in the first 24 hours and that's when you start contesting Nazjak - all of them.
---
god this guy is insufferable, how can people bear watching a screaming manlet like that?
---
"You can't play on this server with your friends, it's already full" 
---
Layering is needed and I would even prefer phasing to limiting your choice of server.
---
How many people would quit the game is my question? I’ve been after Classic for years, am on the edge of my seat - but will happily continue playing pservers IF what they release is closer to retail then Vanilla.
---
Keep rerolling my gnome to get the shortest version and always be hooked up to some noggen for '...you feel smaller'.
---
Unstoppable.
---
That would kinda defeat the point of the layering system. Layering effects the whole continent to avoid that phasing pop-in effect when moving from zone to zone that occurs in the retail version.
---
If you don't understand why understanding the thing you're criticizing is important I'm afraid I can't help you.
---
You could also list eat and sleep under: mental well being. Booth effect your mental health in a lot of different ways. GL with the project
---
Why "and fast"? They are in beta that is only up to 40 - the game doesn't release for 3 months. They need a fix, but they need a fix that works well, not a hack that can be exploited on live.
---
...
---
Why don’t they de-layer the arena if possible?
---
6/10 people will respond seriously
---
I know this is weird but I’m choosing between two range classes and a polar opposite class. Mage, Hunter and Warrior.
---
My goals in classic: 
---
I will be doing some raiding and in my mean time a lot of PvP, like all the time.
---
What I like in a class: 
---
I really like burst damage as it comes to characters, and 1v1ing as I just find that more fun, I know that’s not the best for raiding and endgame but I’d rather have fun then gear myself only towards the best character. Mobility is also thing I like, I don’t want to be stuck in one spot while fighting, I like having control of my character and moving around. The last thing I can think of is scaling, I really like characters who scale well in the end, I’m very into the whole “work hard but pays off long down the road” characters that may not be the best off the bad but are incredible at the end.
---
Levelling process: 
---
I will be levelling by myself till around 20 something+ as after that I have a group of friends that will be levelling together and all be raiding and PvPing together. Their classes also matter on what I’ll be choosing so their classes are:
---
Friend 1: 
---
Holy Priest or Restro Shaman (wont do dps role)
---
Friend 2: 
---
Subtlety Rogue
---
Friend 3: 
---
Destruction Warlock
---
Friend 4: 
---
Mage (small chance for a Druid)
---
We also have two more friends that are not really part of the group, who will only be doing PvPing casually but can help in raids if we happen to need 1-2 more.
---
Friend 5: 
---
Assassination Rogue
---
Friend 6: 
---
Shadow Priest (Won’t heal)
---
I know it seems more like I should be a warrior for the group, since we have a mage, and a lot of casters already, but since we will basically be doing PvP and 40 man, I don’t know if it’s fully needed.
---
Classes that are not an option: Hunter and Warlock: I really like risk, so not a fan of a pet (played hunter from Vanilla - Wrath, then from Wrath - Legion a warlock) those classes don’t have nearly enough risk as my pet can take taunt while levelling, also the Warlock is too much of a “glass cannon” as it doesn’t have much mobility.
---
As a warrior I don’t care if I’m out on tank duty, but as mage at least i know I can always be dps. Spriest I know for raids I’ll have to heal which I am not a fan of but I won’t be doing raids often.
---
Here are my pros and cons of Mage, Spriest, and Warrior:
---
Mage: 
---
One of the best levellers 
---
Most burst damage 
---
Convenient (Drinks+food and portals) 
---
Easy to make money 
---
Best mobility 
---
Good with minimal gear 
---
Great utilities (Ice block, blink, poly, etc)
---
Squishy 
---
Frostbolt (chance I could get bored easier) 
---
Less risk 
---
Running away class 
---
We have a mage 
---
Very populated 
---
Lots of cloth competition in my group 
---
Apparently doesn’t scale well in very end game
---
Hunter:
---
I’m used to how it plays already
---
Can make my character more my own (with the pet)
---
Best at World PvP
---
Lots of mobility
---
No one to compete with armour in my group
---
Chasing / tracking class
---
Not that squishy
---
Easy to gear
---
Easy to make money
---
Easiest to level
---
Worst at dps
---
Scales the worst
---
Not a lot of risk
---
Warrior: 
---
Definitely not squishy 
---
More “risk” 
---
Chasing class 
---
Feel like I’m more “in charge” while raiding. 
---
Fits in better for the group 
---
No one in my group to compete for armour 
---
Scales very well in far end game
---
Cons: 
---
Worst leveller 
---
Less burst damage 
---
Harder to make money
---
Am competitive, can be kited easily in PvP 
---
Decently populated 
---
Not great till good gear 
---
Probably the worst class World PvP wise solo
---
They don't camp. I think that is the main reason no one hates them.
---
I said this joke on Countdown to Classic a couple of weeks ago... GOOD MEME!

Usually they stream snipe streamers. Also they seem to just target streamers mostly. And I don't think they camp. They just patrol and kill.
---
Who said it would benefit the mafia?
---
What's the problem with having 3 chests? Have you forgot that layered server would have much more players that any classic server ever had? 1 player shouldn't have access to all of them, everything else is okay.
---
You're doing pre-nerf C'thun? Awesome. Sooo this is not going to take place on Blizzard's Wow Classic. What server are you planning doing this on?
---
Excess servers which then get merged as numbers decline is the only answer.  It was the only answer 15 years ago and it is the only answer now.  There will be no other answer.  Layering/sharding is antithetical to classic and always will be.

---
Yeh, but i was  not talking about loot was I? Vanilla wow droprates for crafting material like herbs/ spawnrates for mob skininng and such were tailored to specific count of concurrent players. But for now all im reading even from die hard no changes is no changes but with more players. 
---
Im perfectly fine playing on realm with 2000 players with original craft goods rates without layering and such. But, if people want more players on realms than original count it must be adjusted either by layering or different rates.
---
Leveled my warrior 1-60 with using heroic strike as my main damage output.
---
I leveled as Arms. Put all my points into it, expecting my arms to be stronger, and hit harder. 4-5 months later, I was level 60. 
---
Now for my first MC raid.
---
CL asked why my damage was so low.. What was my rotation?
---
My rotation, I asked?
---
I just use heroic strike whenever I had the rage for it!
---
Oh boy did my world turn upside down when I learned about Mortal Strike!
---
Live in Shanghai but I have an unsubbed Taiwan account. 
---
Currently planning to play on US servers because of lack of English speakers. Plus I was unsure if there would be a server. But if there is a server and if you do find a group of players please post about it.
---
I'd trade 220ms for 80ms in a heart beat.
---
Uhm I see it more like a no tolerance policy should be used here. The system has a good balance between regulating load on servers and allow people to play together. From a technical standpoint I can totally understand the idea of layering. You really don't want the one server one db system back. In retrospect, building on the bad infrastructure classic had was one of the biggest mistakes they have made, from a technical standpoint.
---
We cannot have nice things because people are idiots and exploit them. Problem is that this is quite a hard to automate task. 
---
I'd do something like: exploit it once, get your character reset + 14d ban, exploit twice you get IP banned.
---
In case of farming, remove all their running auctions as well.

That's true, tbh all of the physical well being side affect also on mental side. But it felt easier to divide them that way as they both have also an effect on my actual physical shape. I'll be covering all the effects on upcoming videos, don't worry. :D 
---
But thanks a lot! It's gonna be fun.
---
STOP, STOP! HE’S ALREADY DEAD!
---
Your damage in raids is neglectable. So you never want to leave def stance for max tps and survivability. Stance dancing is a lot more viable when you dont want to dump as much rage as possible.
---
It's also listed under Confirmed Bugs (Ctrl + F -&gt; Leeway).
---
I don't know how leeway was back in vanilla, and it's hard to judge as I don't have access to beta. I truly think that just looking to videos/streams doesn't allow you to "feel" the range, maybe it's just a graphical bug (animations or such).
---
Hopefully Blizz will manage something.
---
The difficulty level of all this will be pre-nerh C'thun ;). Not sure yet about the server, but I'm going to be playing on EU PvP. Not sure how many servers they will be giving us
---
Maybe not the answer you're hoping for but have a nice guild forming up on OCE servers with a lot of players living in Western Australia/Asia. Raid times might suit you. Link to our discord: &lt;Ludicrous Speed&gt; https://discord.gg/x8z7tgT
---
Back when my guild was raiding MC, I was pulling mobs clearing trash. I had what I thought was just a lag spike. Ended up disconnecting. Guild bust into laughter as I ran to the mob, past the mob and into the lava. Log back in and I can’t be rezed. 
---
Gy run for me.
---
I did mine too lol, but I doubt itll account to anything
---
Oh well thank you very much! I certainly will! Hopefully I can finish Ragnoros soon enough.
---
Have fun waiting for you Holy Priest to slowly corpserun his ass into SM!
---
But streamers would abuse arena otherwise!
---
There are these things called queues they can add to keep a desirable cap on the online population.
---

---
 Paladin! You strike fear into the hearts of the Horde,  
---
Simply using your hammer and bubble-hearth.  
---
You think that you are a warrior,  
---
But you will always be the guy who never heals!
---
I reckon a hard cap at 60.
---
Disable the stupid layering after you exit the starting zone.
---
Stoneform is good as a rogue, allowing you to vanish/stealth in situation you won't be usually able to (very good in mirror matches and vs warriors). Also good as a dwarf mana user vs all those pesky viperstings
---
Escape artist is the best racial for a warrior in pvp, it's also good as a caster to get away from pesky melee. I don't remember if it breaks the net, it should. More intellect and a root/slow break is also good for casters as well.
---
NE are very nice as hunters, feign into trap into meld allows for some nice surprise combos.
---
But the biggest difference if shaman vs paladin.
---
God the level boost question is sickening. How much would you pay us if we "saved you" 120 hours spent playing the game you're paying to play. These people are real.
---
You’re the hero we deserve.
---
Back in the day Tak could run the same speed as mounts so he was amazing for chasing down people until they nerfed him.
---
Oh, so used reactive native. I thought you used OG android layouts and java.  
---
I've been working on the same app myself (just for practice purposes), and it's been pain in the ass to implement layout which supports different resolutions.  
---
Thanks for answer anyway!
---
I did it ... SHOW THEM CLASSICWOW POWER ! :)
---
It only looked like a noob-move from the outside but it actually was a bug with Teamspeak where my push-to talk button, "*" on the numpad was interpreted as pushing my pet-attack-keybind "^" by WoW.
---
But I didn't know about that at the moment it happened and only found out later.
---
I was late to arrive at 60 as I rerolled. So my guild was already going BWL. Since raids were difficulty to form, I actually was allowed to join the BWL-raid with my fresh 60 hunter.
---
Went well up until Razergore or whatever the 3rd boss is called. Raidleader explained tactics, I wanted to ask a question and... well, my push to talk-key triggered my pet attack without me noticing. They tried to save the situation but it of course ended in a wipe. After the raid I had a talk with the raid-leader. As I said, at that time I had no idea what was going on. Only found out about that later. So I couldn't explain why it happened. My pet pulled the boss and I didn't know why. This of course made me look like I have no clue what I was doing. Not only was I no longer allowed to come into BWL but the other hunters in the guild had to dismiss their pet while raiding because of me.
---
This single move basically ruined my reputation with the entire guild. Still did some MC with their Twinks but eventually rerolled again.
---
You don’t understand layering if you think it won't make your questing any easier.
---
Layering needs to go,  make server caps 8k.  The chaos is the reason people love classic fresh servers. Anyone else saying differently has never experienced it.
---
I'm very very sure there will be voluntary transfers set up. Asmon and Soda are going to have to deal with queue times though, that comes with the territory of being a big boy streamer.
---
Coast of Feralas is a steady source of Stonescale Eels as well
---
Src: Used to bot fish - was how my character made a fortune for me while i was fast asleep.
---
I want what you are smoking!, but on a serious note a hard cap once you reach 60 would work great

Anyway I'm leveling a new char as I missed out on the raid group. There is this warrior doing a really shit job at tanking. Plus we're in RFC and he's not chaining. So we're all standing around waiting for him. A few my group members our using party chat to express their frustration. As I the healer was at full mana and he should chain till I'm half full.
---
So we're still doing the slowest fucking instance ever. During a lull in the raid group talking in the room. I'm like, 'this is the slowest fucking instance of RFC ever.'
---
Someone across the room goes 'you're telling me!'
---
So I respond to query what instance they are doing. RFC, they reply. I sarcastically reply your tank a grandfather too? He says yes. Eventually I put two and two together. I'm like Neil? In the party chat and he responds with mine.
---
We both kissed out on the raid group and rolled new characters on different servers. Somehow when we did that we had picked the same server on different days at our own homes. That night we flukly mentioned one significant thing about the instance and found our characters.
---
ahh right. 
---
I expect we will get local servers since we have a datacentre now, just thought it had been confirmed by blizz somewhere.
---
How many ooga copy-cats will be?
---
I bet plenty of them:)
---
One ooga per realm:D
---
they're just so disconnected from what matters that it actually hurts to observe
---
Or they realized it might actually be a challenge.
---
Back in vanilla, I was helping farm the sq bugs for the scepter quest, along with a hunter.   We had been friendly, but while grinding we got to know each other.
---
Dude no only lived in the same city as me, he also lived in the same general neighborhood.
---
I'm like damn, I'm on so and so street.    He stopped and says, is this a joke?   Who are you?.  I tell him again, and ask, do you know my street?  He replies, yes, I'm on that street too.
---
Ends up being we lived half a block away.  In a city of 6 million.   Still in touch to this day.
---
Because its supposed to be one world, that is how an authentic classic experience is supposed to be.
---
If a mafia is formed, I would rather have that, we have no idea if Blizzard is even going to tolerate faction cooperation like that. Even if they would be allowed to form, nothing is stopping anyone from challenging them. 
---
Its damn cool even that a mafia can exist, that is simply the community aspect of vanilla.
---
Its insane to me to propose sharding as an argument to counter the mafia, as sharding itself is a much bigger issue than the mafia.
---
How disappointing, only 3 boars per live to win. Gotta bump up those numbers boy.
---
"Druid is a fast leveling class"
---
Well...
---
It is also very clearly aimed at Classic too. I believe what they looked at is the player drop off rate during leveling in vanilla. i.e. a lot of people never made it to max level and the "good content" so they want to make it easier. This obviously goes against everything good about the game so yea I am strongly against this.
---
Layering needs to go, we need player interaction and lots of it. Plus people are going to abuse this like crazy.
---
I mean it'll still give you a valid overview of what your class is all about and how it plays.
---
It would piss too many people off. Its okay now because its a beta, but the community has made it very clear that they want no changes, and forcing you at certain levels would be a BIG change.
---
Casual players dont need to catch up, and the casual player will not be happy with hitting a cap. You are level 30 now? No reason to play anymore unless you are hardcore and wanna do everything to get BiS, because everything else (besides maybe training up crafting) is pointless right now. Completing quests mesns wasted XP, same with killing mobs, why should they dictate leveling speed? Not to mention this will definitely make zones more crowded and harder for casuals in both mob tagging and being ganked.
---
Dungeons and zones is kind of a good point, but again, unless you are hardcore and want to get BiS stuff, you still wont do them. If you dont want to do dungeons when leveling it likely wont make you want to do it because you were capped.
---
&gt;It could also prevent people from burning out to quickly
---
I am quoting this part because its probanly the biggest problem with it. That is Retail WoW philosphy that isnt good. If I want to grind for 48 hours killing mobs to get my rep i should be able to  I shouldnt be forced to a certain amount everyday. That makes it so if I skip a day I wasted, and I am forced to play a little everyday. Obviously its a bit different here, but its forcing you to play until the cap, and then leaving and coming back once the cap is unremoved. If I want to get ot level 60 in 2 weeks I should be able to.
---
It really doesnt give devs more time to polish content/phases... they just don't reease it until its done. I don't think their is any set schedule announced for how long phases will last, but they can take as long as they need. They dont need to make level caps to make the patch come out in 7 months.
---
Sorry, long post, but thats my thoughts on it haha
---
Depends on your definition of semi-hardcore. I'd put insane people week one, poop sock hardcore week 2, hardcore week 3-4. The late August release date screwed over a lot of people.
---
SmoothMcGroove, the YouTube singer, he's on the beta and just the chillest of dudes. Or else, MadSeasonShow, Perplexity, and others
---
This is the most BS ive read in a while. Do you know how to find bugs in a beta? Yes? Right, by PLAYING THE GAME. 
---
How do you want to TEST bugs if you dont know what is bugged? Right, you cant. Thats why you PLAY THE GAME to find bugs and report them, which ive done several times. 
---
Also there could be bugs in ZF, maybe my fking BiS item is bugged? You say we should not do that, so you will cry about that one item on release. 
---
So you should just shut up and let us ppl PLAY THE GAME.
---
Ha, nice one
---
Swipe hits all enemies once. Confused about your swipe comment.
---
See, regular servers with a vanilla-like population cap and queues would be my preferred way to handle all this as well. It has been pointed out to me, however, that this is 2019 and people cannot be expected to wait in a queue. In essence, people would rather play a weird cross-realm game for months than wait in a queue for a week.
---
&gt; For example will it affect my reputation and delay the possibility to buy a mount at lvl 40
---
Your native racial mount does not require any sort of rep. Just the gold and level 40. However any other faction mount will require you to be Exalted with that faction first.
---
&gt; WHO CARES that STV is a shit show... That's WHAT MOST OF US WANT.
---
Literally saying this on the same week that r/classicwow had another meltdown because streamers weren't chain-running SM all week because STV was impossible to navigate.
---
At this point I don't believe what ya'll *say* you want.
---
Not sure I understand where you're coming from — if you're not going for BiS then you'll be taking what you can get and we're beyond nit-picking stats. If you were really worried about min-maxing your raid healing you wouldn't be playing druid in the first place.
---
I guess the answer is the sets are better than pre-raid gear.
---
Warriors are garbage in vanilla pvp unless equipped with a pocket healer on follow.
---
Worth it until you had gotten 10 kills on every player on the opposing faction.
---
You have to manually switch targets with either the tab-key or by clicking their health-bars.
---
That's what tanking multiple mobs is all about. Warriors don't have it any better.
---
The only way to get a little bit of initial AoE-Aggro on every mob is using Demo-Roar. But this won't really help much.
---
right, i was saying the person I was replying to was correct
---
It only makes sense that ion could transition so smoothly.
---
Just avoid Asmongold and maybe StaySafe, lots of memes, lots of pseudo-theorycrafting that always ends up in a dead-end and no interesting gameplay whatsoever, others are chill, but for talented players you gotta go for perplexity, venruki, snutz or other guys like that, some good players out there
---
As horde you looted the blood of enemy players and handed it in to the shaman in the cave in the horde base. Once they had enough they moved as a group to the summoning spot north of icewing garrison and started the ritual. 10 players were required I think. Horde got the big ice elemental Lok'holar the Icelord or something like that. Alliance did the same thing but has druids at their base and summoned Ivus the Forest lord.
---
If you completed the quest which required collecting supplies from the enemy mine, once enough supplies were collected someone with sufficient frostwolf rep could unleash the frostwolf reavers, mounted elites who moved north to the enemy base.
---
Handing in armour scraps strengthened all your faction npc .
---
I think collecting ram hides provided mounts (saddles) for your wolf riders and supplies from your own mine provided the riders themselves? I'm not 100% on this as it's been a while.
---
Had so many games where Horde were camped at the bridge unable to break through and a small team of us summoned Lok, fed him dwarf npcs, summoned the reavers and steamed the base. It's a sight to behold.
---
Yes from the fact that we have nothing to prove it.
---
I think the point of fast is more to the point of being able to have more beta testing done with their given solution to see if it actually solves the problem. If they come up with a solution a few weeks before launch, and it ends up not actually working, the probability of them being able to design, implement, and test a different solution before launch day seems pretty low.
---
I just don't understand how they can sit at Blizzcon and say all the right things about being true to vanilla wow then EVEN consider leveling boost.
---
Of the DPS classes they're some of the most demanded. Everyone likes polymorph, free water, and a portal home.
---
Barrelroll
---
SL is unkillable
---
"Working out the kinks"... at the moment this looks to be a disaster
---
I was making reference to one of their spell which is basically another heartstone not bagspace.
---
Sorry, I am actually Jewish. My humour is a little self deprecating but I will keep it in check in future. Thank you for letting my know I was stepping over the line
---
No it doesn't. It's capped to 3 targets just as OP says.
---
Yea, there's only a couple of months left so this might just be how it is going to be at the start at least.
---
Probably have nothing to do with layering
---
Actually, he is the president now. They got rid of Mike because he talked back to Activision.
---

---
If you use the grow buff from questing in southern durotar from the voodoo guy. He'll grow you for 5mins and the grow will last client side past the buff if you log out once during. But I believe it's only client side. Unsure if this is similar or not.
---
True, but being exalted with your native faction, will have an 10% discount for your mount.
---
Hmm, looked it up on the vanilla wiki before posting that to OP and didn’t see anything about that, weird. I even played a druid back then, don’t remember it.
---
That almost makes me wanna roll a gnome instead of human... hmmm...
---
It's fine. I'd rather have Venruki getting a chest than a completely dead server after a few weeks because there was no system in place to handle the tourists.
---
&gt;Wednesday 24 June 2020
---
Well, see you in Classic-TBC then...
---
The server should never have 6 layers to begin with though should it, should be AT MOST 3 imo
---
&gt;Vanilla like population 
---
&gt;Vanilla realm median total population of 10-11,000
---
???? Where are you getting those numbers. Total population in retail vanilla was 1/4 of that +\-
---
Aha, a lot what made classic what it was, was the team behind it. That team has moved on, we have a new team trying to bring classic back, expect boosts, etc, just not at launch and maybe not to level cap.
---
I love these questions and I hope for the best for current WoW!
---
&gt; So what do you guys recommend: Should I pick Rogue or Mage? And why?
---
Rogue spec are imho a very cooldown reliant class (vanish sprint etc...) while mages can still be efficient without their, then mages have good utilities such as portal, teleports, food &amp; water and is one of the only classes able to aoe farm efficiently, it's is also the one able to do it early in the game.
---
That’s why it should only be in starter zones (under lv 20) and only for the first 2-3 weeks.
---
It's not even remotely like sharding. With sharding you will get phased just by moving over the bounds of a shard. Popular areas on retail are sharded 50 times, with a close uninteresting area being sharded only a few times. This means people phase all around the world just by walking, often multiple times per minute. This is a million times worse than layering.
---
Layering is basically duplicating the entire server, so Blizzard can create bigger servers at launch that "collapse" into a single layer later when the population declined. Theoretically this is a perfect solution for the population issue that WILL arise.
---
The problem is that you need to be able to hop layers to play with friends on the same server. This opens these abuse issues. Someone mentioned only being able to switch layers in main cities, as well as keeping your layer between logouts, and I think this would be a really good solution to combat the majority of issues (though warlock portals could still be used).
---
To not have 800 people fighting for the same 20 boars with 5 minute timers
---
I know this is probably sarcasm but who's going to give up the gurubashi arena to someone else other than a streamer really, you gotta be offering a fair amount of gold or be BFFs.
---
They will never implement layers with 3500 limit it defeats the purpose of the layer, 200 max.
---
They know leveling boost is a no go for many, I highly doubt they will include it.
---
How much? I have one I might sell.
---
He got hit by the mob a few times, he might have gotten one more hit in than the mob did.  
---
But overall yea, if he's not within 5 yards of the mob when backpedaling, they can't hit each other.
---
Don't see anything wrong with the clip.
---
That makes sense in starting areas and nowhere else.
---
Thanks for taking time to write this up! 
---
The burning out was the biggest factor for me. People who I loved just fucking around with left private servers once raids became a farm and the challenge was gone.  I also found myself regretting I zoomed through the content too fast to get to level 60, having to wait for people I wanted to raid with to catch up.
---
I've been saying that layering is terrible since it was announced, each time I was downvoted to oblivion.
---
Not really mine, but from a BWL raid with my guild. We hadn't cleared it for too long yet (on farm, but not 100% guaranteed to clear Nef first try) and were on Nefarian again. All is going as expected and nearly done with it .. All of a sudden the dragon starts running around, one-shotting people and wrecking everyone ...
---
Turns out one of the paladins had Divine Interventioned the MT (probably wanted to do Lay on Hands or something instead) ... People were not amused.
---
Yeah, they should really redo these threads now that the sub is much bigger.
---
Yeah, a baby would be smarter than that.
---
We had this one AV that I left after 3 hours because I had other shit to do and for whatever reason I didn't have time to play the next day. The day after that I joined AV and noticed that the top names were still the same, but they had accumulated a ton of kills, but the frontline had only pushed a  graveyards worth closer to the Alliance base. In the end, that game went on for almost 72 hours.
---
Probably the investors are liking the popularity of Classic, but don't understand the old business model of investment+loyalty=stable subscription $$ vs instant reward = quick $$ + uninvested playerbase + unstable subscription $
---
I mean people capped below 60 in classic, it's called twinking.
---
I really hope they sort this out before release.
---
I think switching Layers should give you a notification that you need to accept and then require you to sit still for 20 seconds when you are not at an Inn... just like when you log out.
---
But throwing people back and forth between layers on the fly is absolutely terrible!
---
&gt; I am pretty sure no expansion post cata takes 120 hours to level.
---
That's very subjective, i'm a pretty average player and that's about how long it takes me to get to 120 if i take my time and not rush.           
---
While the old record in vanilla is about 90~ hours.
---
To me it seems more like a question aimed at average or below average retail players, rather than classic players.
---
Yes exactly. NOWHERE ELSE
---
Yeah, he should stop doing what he enjoys and loves and makes a shit ton of money from. He should get a "real" job like everyone else, one where he hates his job and makes 1/10th as much. Thats what real work is!
---
Because the people at Blizzcon probably want the same game as you, but they have to convince the investors to use an old business model that doesn't get them that quick buck they love.
---
This is due to a layering issue I believe.
---
Good times.
---
Yes we do, because many of us already spend 3 years on foot in Classic. I wasn’t a fan of flying back then, and I’m not a fan of it now either.
---
Lawyers are actually paid alot of money to not lie to people. Word things ambiguously to ensure wiggle room sure. Respond in a way that doesn't technically answer a question sure. But they don't lie. Lying means you can be sued and being sued is really expensive.
---
yes I personally think putting up with an overpopulated world will suck at the beginning but is the better solution then layering.
---
If you wanna do something about the problem maybe introduce dynamic spawns for one or two weeks instead of splitting the world in layers.
---
You eat less often for more time, great tradeoff /s
---
You don't have a greater ability to take on multiple mobs since you do less damage
---
BiS stat for pvp while leveling? What pvp while leveling a warr, what are you going to do make the rogue killing you spend 2 more seconds?
---
Good luck.  I hope to hear word of your eventual success right here at (also shameless plug) /r/classicwow !
---
eeeeh...His level of performance never really improved from his TBC days. Listening to it today is certainly nostalgic if a bit cringy
---
With all the pet websites and plethora of guides on youtube, no, nothing will really be rare again. Everyone will know about every pet and how to get it with a quick search. Just like in retail, no one will give a shit, tbh.
---
Layering is a sad technology.
---
Remember, Vanilla was designed zone first, then the questing was shoe-horned in after. Likely the Horde would need a foothold in the zone if it was to be a neutral zone (although Wetlands is neutral and has no Horde base I know of?). I'm not keen on them having a giant fuck off port though. Maybe a shitty landing site with a few huts further up the coast or something instead.
---
Yes I understand that and I wholeheartedly support that effort and is mightily impressed. Just when comparing parts of Joanas guide you complained about not using Dungeons among other things, but if you got no team getting Dungeons fast is pretty hard. That all I meant, comparing solo leveling to 80 man team leveling isn't really possible
---
They have in fact killed him 3v1 on occasion lolz
---
"What?"? You're an asshole, man, that's what. I mean, sorry for your loss, but dude. Being as mad as you are at someone who is suffering from an addiction is just...wow. That's a bitch move, and the way you deal with stuff like that is exactly the reason why so many people can't break out of their addictions. Because people like you reinforce their belief that they're worthless pieces of shit, which is why many started drinking in the first place, and you treating them like that is definitely not helpful. Most addicts suffer from mental illnesses, and people with your mindset don't help them get better, they make it worse, make them keep drinking themselves to death instead of being kind, compassionate and offering them the help they so clearly need.
---
A camp sure, not a giant port.
---
It's a pity that there seem to be no text input fields.
---
I for example would think that a levelsquish would be cool. To reach endgame content you then simply do the story questlines (which usually bring you to the new max level).
---
I can see how that could be fun, but it's not something that I would actually want for the original Classic release. Could be something for unofficial servers to explore, maybe.
---
The only additional 'cap' I would agree with is MC/Ony opening 3-4 weeks after release only.
---
&gt;The party needs to allow the Paladin to pull unless the Paladin asks them to pull.
---
Guess hunters are your best friend there. That added threat sounds quite nice for a paladin I guess.
---
Should it not be "mar**s**hes"?
---
**marsh** -- An area of low-lying land that is usually saturated with water and is dominated by herbaceous rather than woody plants.
---
**march** -- Has a lot of definitions, but not one relating to an area or lands.
---
He, just like you, doesn't get any-fucking-thing. Both of you are horrible people if you're not trolling.
---
You bend over and take anything blizzard will give you don't you? I am impressed they could convince someone to defend sharding like this.
---
Yeah I had vods turned off for that reason but people kept saving they wanted it anyway.
---
Blizz said themselves the layers will have caps similar to vanilla retail servers, i.e. 3500ish...
---
do they stream?
---
Instanced areas are instanced areas.
---
According to my calculations if I hit 60 before christmas I will have exceeded my own expectations.  As a classic vanilla player who hasn't touched the game since Wrath I'm ok with that goal.
---
Lotus will be bind on pick up.
---
Loads to do, sort professions out, farm gold, farm pre-ranking BIS pvp gear from dungeons/proffs, should also raid honestly since a bunch of raid gear is bis for pvp.
---
In vanilla were you able to queue up as a full 40 man premade? Not sure if it was only applicable to WSG and AB. Thanks!
---
Thorns damages all targets hitting you
---
The suits solely think in terms of quarterly $ reports and if they aren’t seeing constant growths then they’ve failed somehow.
---
Newsflash,they ARE worthless piece of garbage.
---
it wouldnt be that big of a change and the for the casual crowd class quests make vanilla. Wer talking 3 or 4 usuable items late game. If we delay things like this til phase 6, wer straight back into the 1% complete rate.
---
Last night in 4 hours I makes 1.25 g. I think I’m sitting on 6-7g right now. 
---
With the amount of leather I’m getting there’d be no reason why wouldn’t be able to buy a mount at 40 if I was selling it on the AH
---
I hope that alliance on this server would work out something to contra them.... I can imagine epic videos and set ups for fights. This story have so much potential.
---
It is split by class, yes.
---
The marches are a border area between to regions, like england and scotland or the free matches in the dragon age games
---
for examples this region is the border between khaz modan and the southern eastern kingdoms
---
What would you guys consider to be the most saturated classes per faction? I was thinking of going Hunter or Warlock, but I got put off the number of Hunters around in Pservers. Also, Alliance warlocks seem in short supply, which could be good? (PVE wise).
---
How about, when you click on a spawn that object gets a cooldown for everg layer and you can’t interact with it for a set amount of time?
---
I am still deciding, but I am tempted to roll a Human Warlock as my main. I know its not optimal (both Alliance *and* not a gnome), but I think I like the fantasy of it.
---
Could you share the build ?
---
Thanks! I’ll be posting my progress also here (unless I got downvoted out of the subreddit) and ofc the yt-channel is the easiest way to follow it :)
---
I must have misread the previous post
---
Dynamic respawns is another solution which while also not optimal in my opinion is better than playing Layers of Warcraft. Also you could make dynamic respawns restricted a short time period also.
---
If server is dying merge servers. Namechange if needed who cares - all better than standing in one place and not seeing someone else also there.
---
Oh they could absolutely chose, that's how retail sharding works, sort of.
---
If they wanted to they could have it work only in the starting area.
---
That’s so cool!
---
I took the easy way with the ad-hominem there, yeah. But what you're proposing is literally apartheid. It also sets a precedent of players controlling who plays and how, and the blues wont like that, because in the end its their game, and they do what they want with it.
---
Yeah there are different boars I have to kill at certain levels. Currently there is only one boar who gives me XP, Bellygrub, and he’s on a 5 minute respawn
---
&gt; people want to rank on the logs.
---
Whoa, this hadn't even occured to me. For Mages, do logs even matter when all you do is spam Frostbolt? I mean it's all purely gear and no skill required what so ever.
---
That’s absolutely insane. The odds, man. The odds!
---
Every time I see the TBC prepatch version of Shield of Condemnation, with inflated armor value, I wince.

---
https://itemization.info/item/22819
---
I have seen many posts now that indicates that some think that PvE can be ignored if you want to PvP. That's not true in Classic.
---
The thing is that you don't seem to understand that this is forum/discussion thread, OP has shared a story and started a discussion based around people's personal connections through the medium of video games, it speak volumes to your character(or possible lack thereof) that you felt the need to belittle someone else's experiences. I'm not going to make assumptions about who you are as a person but im damn sure it's no one i'd like to have a conversation with if you can't even appreciate how much this meant to the OP, you're in the wrong thread. Honestly though if you want to talk about it PM me. I'm happy to help, just don't come at it with the same attitude you have shown here. People want to share sometimes, nothing wrong with it.
---
I don't think that's what they are referring too with that patchnote, why would they then mention AoEs?
---
Haha. Yeah that time includes AH and travel ect. Sadly it’s going to get worse for a little while. There is only one boar who gives XP and he’s on a minute respawn.
---
&gt; because STV was impossible to navigate.
---
Its only impossible if your sole goal is to level asap. Which is stupid. I mean if people want to do this fine everybody can do in the game what they want but this are the same people that complain afterwards that there is nothing to do in the game. 
---
Also there are alternatives to STV.
---
Swipe goes only against 3 Targets.
---
What you can do however:
---
- Thorns to actually do dmg/produce threat to everyone hitting you
---
- Hot yourself up with Regrowth and Rejuvenation to get threat via healing when you get damaged
---
- Pull the Mobs via Hurricane to get some good Initial threat
---
- Put up demo roar as it also provides some threat
---
- Use consumables before going bear form (EZT Dynamite, immolate oil)
---
 Guys its just a beta ok? Blizzard is known to polish games well in beta.
---
 Go watch some positivity streams of truly not sellout streamers, sub and get hyped for classic! Seriously, guys, game is exactly as it was! Old blizzard feeling and all.
---
No info has been released about Phase timings.  
---
Even if your dad or uncle works at Atari, without any kind of proof, its pure speculation.
---
but the dragonmaw orcs are native to this region, they build the port not the horde.
---
This would actually need to function as the kind of capital for the dragonmaw orcs just like blackrock hold does for the blackrock orcs and thunder axe fortress for the burning blade orcs
---
World PvP. Will be enough other people grouping up to trash the other faction.
---
I’m sure blizzard isn’t worried about us when it comes to the first week. They’re worried about new players coming in to see what it’s like or retail players testing the waters. They could lose a lot of new blood.

Considering that the pvp rewards will be in their updated 1.12 state you can, but you will never be as strong as somebody who both raids and pvps since some pve items are very strong.
---
&gt;Cleanse wasn't the problem. Cleanse doesn't even remove Curses, only Corruption/Immolate.

Corruption, Immolate (preventing conflag), Fear, Siphon Life.
---
Cleanse is a gigantic problem for Warlocks. By far the biggest individual problem that Paladins cause. 
---
Your whole response is based on a 1v1 but the person you responded to didn't limit their claim to just 1v1.

Considering this was February of 2005 not really. Besides there wasn't the giant rush to 60 back then.
---
PvP and raid. I play vanilla for the wPvP anyway
---
Boob physics always win.
---
I don't know how people can be this delusional
---
I’ll get skinning and mining. Sell the skinning mats and send mining mats to an bank alt. However, if I outlevel mining, then i won’t go back, but just level it at 60 instead. I don’t really know if or when i’ll outlevel mining, but i think it will happen, because i’ll only take nodes that comes on my leveling journey.
---
I joined after classic so I'm not sure what is going on here. Can someone give me an ELI5?

I don't see a raid, I see one player.
---
There is a reason why server transfers had a 7 day CD when they were added, and even that took a while.
---
The notion that you can server transfer several times an hour is absurd, and it's definitely gonna cause problems.
---
This is just live thinking messing with classic all over again because the server team doesn't wanna deal with overload and crashes.
---
Nobody cares. Let it overload and crash if it has to. Let it have queues if it has to.
---
Let's have it your way. How the hell would Arthas ride all the way to SW, bang the queen of SW in secret and then ride back without a suspicion?
---
And also you have to accept the overpopulation of starter zones for some time, although that might cause people to just not play.
---
Link?
---
Layering is not a problem BTW
---
Haven’t played in years so I forget queues were a thing. Honestly I would rather have queues than any large scale layering. Launch Classic with an ample number of servers, layer the 1-30 zones and facilitate voluntary realm transfers prior to Phase 2.
---
escape artist, improved stealth on NE and detect stealth on Humans, Meld is amazing as well
---
I feel like every other Hunter and Lock specifically trained to do this intentionally
---
if either player is slowed &gt;29%, then melee abilities no longer get leeway, auto-attacks get leeway regardless of how slowed either player is.... Except if one of the players are backpedaling or rp walking, because those have different movement flags.
---
You can only layer hop once a week.
---
There, fixed it.
---
Raided a bit as an rdruid.
---
Wasen't hard to get a raidspot, pretty sure that was true for all healers. We were usually 2 or 3 rdruids in my raid IIRC. The ability to remove curses makes or breakes some fights and let's be honest, the mage isn't going to do jack shit.
---
Never was declined for a dungeon spot because i didn't have a rez or if i was it happened so few times that i can't remember it happening.
---
The main problem with the cable from Perth is that it gets damaged all the fucking time and that makes the online gaming experience horrendous.
---
No confirmed date but it'll be **at least** Jan 2020. Might be Feb, March, April. Anyone who thinks it's sooner is completely delusional, ignore 'em.
---
bfa
---
46 hours a week isnt really casual...
---
Flawless
---
But they could coordinate a move with the people they care about, and so could other non-streamers, so that feels like a non-issue
---
Why don't these raptors drop the silver already?
---
Yeah, way less overall warlocks on Alliance, partly due to WOTF. I'd say less gear competition but if you're going to BIS you won't wear tier sets anyway so that's on you.
---
MC is not going anywhere and there'll be plenty of runs even years from now.
---
Best way would be to fill the server with enough players for 2 layers as it will be on release. Right now there is like 500 active player per faction. So you have 1000 active players in total and more than 1 layer but on release you will have 3000 per layer making events like these and other things like black lotus or devil saur more contested which could still be a problem but with potentially less impact if more players fight over those things in each layer.
---
The thing is, they can’t change this about layering. They can limit how many times you can hop layers, but you *must* be able to hop layers to join groups.
---
The layering system *itself* is the issue. The core concept of it goes directly against immersion.
---
I don’t get why they’d pour all this energy into a Classic reboot but suddenly introduce a system that destroys immersion and is exploitable.
---
If you think this is bad wait till you see what top guilds do to Black Lotus economy within 2 weeks of launch.
---
I feel like layering will cause true fans to second-guess their decision to return to Classic and potentially return to private servers. Even if they are packed, there’s no exploits like this.
---
Woah bucko you sure told me with that incredibly clever "no u".
---
Cause blind hate is so logical?
---
No it won’t?
---
you will just have to sit in queue which is still better than layering imho
---
This is everyone in any industry.
---
I work in a fast casual restaurant as a member of management and heard our GM explain that even though our numbers for May were the best we've ever had, April was down so we cant celebrate about it.  And if April had been up, Im sure we would have heard "but we're going i to summer, so business is going to dip.  No time to cheer about anything right now"
---
Im assuming youll be playing on a pve server if youre collaborating cross faction
---
This wouldn’t work with deadmines and blackfathom and others where you have to fight to the entrance
---
I don't know how else to explain it if you still don't understand man, sorry.
---
Okey i get it. You are a fan boy?
---
BC but it wasn’t until around lvl 16 I figured out how to equip items
---
How mature can you be if people have to walk on eggshells around you?

---
I would rather wait than do that, seriously, the environment will turn so toxic when you have to have raids to to tag mobs
---
Because 10,000 people doing the same quest at the same time doesn't sound very fun?
---
That aint right at all, what about people who herb and don’t alch?
---
yeeaaaah sure just like they said classic will never happen and now its here?
---
I prefer the Classic version as the more festive one. The clothes indicate a ruler or queen.
---
BfA is the classic fighter.
---
Agreed, but layering or something like it is needed for launch (in the starter zones), otherwise there will be like 3 different raids fighting over tagging mobs
---
&gt; But really it's just that current players raid in a game that holds their hand until the moment the encounter starts, and gives them a big fluffy cushion to land on when they fail.
---
Oh, for fucks sake...
---
*Having a game focusing on the part you actually like playing is not a bad choice, you dense...*
---
Do you think it adds flavour to a DnD game when your dungeon master goes to do whatever every five minutes for half an hour? Does it add *meaning* to the few times you can actually say "I roll for defense!"?
---
Do you think it adds to the *flavor* if a tv show did 5 minutes of actual show and 20 minutes of boring advertisement?
---
How can you people make out that *playing the game* is in any way less good than going brain AFK and watching porn on the second screen because you just wiped and nothing is going to happen for 15 minutes?
---
I like classic. But for fucks sake, stop trying to make even the tiniest inconvenience out to be this *meaningful addition* that added so much depth to the game.
---
And if you believe that retail "holds your hand and gives you a cushion", then please go and do a mythic raid. It will quickly eat through your gold savings.
---
Just do a population cap like in vanilla and have queues after that? Whats the problem?
---
If a server drops too low permantly merge it with another. I see no issue.
---
Are you retarded? They are not cutting costs what so ever, they are adding costs if anything.
---
So you think because the players are split they need less server capacity? What? It doesn't matter for their servers if they handle 3x3000 people or 1x9000
---
I think all pets were a bit normalised in 1.12 so I'm not sure it will be different from any other cats

---
If you have holiday or no job and average playtime of 12h a day: YES! its possible.
---
Private Servers making and selling R14 is less problematic then layering IMO.
---
Google Vanilla active accounts and Vanilla realm server list. At the end of Vanilla, there are 7.5-7.6 million accounts, world-wide, spread over almost 700 realms, I think, if my memory servers good, 346 US realms, 320 ish EU realms, and about 170 Asian realms. Add couple dozen Oceanic server, you get very close to 700 realms.
---
So...7.5-7.6 million players over 700 realms. That is a median of 10-11,000 players per Vanilla realm.
---
That is TOTAL POPULATION. Concurrent player pop was 1/4th-1/5th of the total players.
---
But, since on the launch day pretty much EVERYONE will log in, concurrent players = total players, which means, in order to have a 10-11-12k players 3 months after launch, and expect at least the normal dropout rate (50-60%), you need to add an additional 10-11-12k or even more player on launch, per realm.
---
24k players per realm on launch day...3k players per layer...that is 8 layers.
---
Popular realms will need MORE layers, like 9 or 10 or even more.
---
But at Classic launch, I don't see any realm with less than 8 layers.
---
The amount of nerd-rage my 11 year old heart felt when he said that was unparalleled. He said that line, and in my brain I was like THERE ISN'T ANYTHING TO EXPLORE! THE TOWER OF AZORA SUCKS!
---
Yep! Not that it will really matter either, but the mechanical dragonling scales off your engineering level so at max engineering yours will be level 63 while every other race will be 60.
---
A challenge in that the raid is not very challenging so the guild that gets into the raid first, probably at an awkward time of day, gets the world first. Hell, some later phase world firsts will probably be had on NA before EU even gets the patch seeing as EU gets patches one day later.
---
Having no layer at launch just means you literally can't play tho... I'd rather play than not play. Also even if we could play, the experience will be so bad since there'll be a billion people at the starting zones that'll make the questing experience ridiculous. Can you imagine 100 people trying to kill the same quest mob?
---
Activity in beta and launch is not the same tough
---
The bgs are available in beta but no bgs will be available for launch in the actual release
---
Sharding a temporary area fixes that because you can do 1-100 shards easy 
---
Layering the entire world into 1-100 layers is fucking retarded.
---
And if you think splitting the entire world into some single-digit number will actually help during the initial rush, that’s cute
---
Blizzard has royally fucked up on layering. Typical 2019 blizzard. Decides to bring back Classic, fucks it up with layering
---
I'm alright with layering for the first few days or a week. Then it can GTFO.
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=290629/staggered-classic-content-update-six-phases-up-from-four-to-address-itemization-
---
I'd take a bad outcome with context over blindly hating something any day of the week. What you describe is quite literally what we call: ignorance.
---
Are you Elon Musk in disguise?
---
This will go down in WoW history
---
Really doubt they can localize layering to certain parts of a map. Don't think we have that kind of technology lol.
---
Lots of people here, just read the comments above.
---
The bfa one since she actually looks like an undead dark ranger and not some goth nightelf.
---
That test is not gonna go well, who wants to play AV straight for 2-3 days without varity? Out of all beta testers maybe 20% will play AV and after 2-3 BGs some will leave cuz its gonna get boring, the queues will get longer, more ppl leave and no AV will pop since you need 80 ppl for one BG.
---
Spider ichor in Hillsbrad
---
People think that Blizzard is God just because they’re releasing Classic and they will defend Blizz at every turn.
---
But wait until they actually play Classic. “Layering only lasts two weeks!” 
---
Wait until the top progress guild on your server has 10+ people hit 60 in 5 days. 
---
Wait to see what they do to devilsaur/black lotus/arena trinket, etc
---
Sadly, by then they will change their mind, and by then it will be too late.
---
It'd be funny for a minute or two until you realize you can't play at all in this environment and the prospect of hundreds of level 1's that look all the same just stacked on top of each other will just kill the experience for a lot of newer players.
---
If you play a warrior or other mele whit the exception of druid, look up weapons quest in advance. Having a current weapon is crucial. Same goes for wands on a wand class. If you play healer/tank you can do selected dungeons whit out losing to much exp/h but only do them ones whit all the quest. If you use the same gear like warrior/paladin you might want to funnel gear to the warrior sins he/she will do the most damage. If one if you play paladin or warlock you have it easy to get mount at 40 if you play a travel class you might want to get mount on the other class first.

I don't have saved in my clipboard at all times, but this is such widespread knowledge that you will have no issues finding a source.
---
TRAPPED IN MYSELF. BODY MY HOLDING CEEEEEEELL
---
They should make it so you have to be in a city to order to switch layers
---
That's awesome lol was this on the beta or vanilla?
---
Why is layering even active in the beta? There aren't nearly enough people for it to be needed.
---
It needs to be removed before it ruins the games early economy, and therefor the game for everyone.
---
Rewatched it last week. You are correct
---
The beta. This happened a some hours ago.
---
EA is ok, but the cast time is rough. 
---
Improved stealth is only good for rogues, and even then stun resist+berserk/WotF are clearly better. 
---
Detect stealth is good, but only really in rogue vs rogue or lock vs rogue. 
---
Meld is cheesy, but not really good. Its the worst racial active ability imo. The change to make it usable in combat in later expacs was crucial to its useability
---
The honor system wasn't part of leveling on release in vanilla. Why would it be for classic?
---
Thats awesome man, stay in contact maybe try play on the same server when classic releases

Unless, I'm just spit balling here, you, maybe, I dunno, *added them to your friends list*.
---
I understand that because of game mechanics it is no longer *necessary* to group up, make meaningful friendships, etc.... but there isn't anything stopping you from being more social than the bare minimum to get a world boss or key finished.
---
I have a large list of friends, some I still talk to and play with regularly, just because we did something fun, and I went out of my way to add them to my friends list.
---
This didn't have to be shown in a stream, though. even before the beta released, on the classic podcast and such, esfand and the others were saying stuff like this would happen. If you've ever played wow in the past 10 years even, you knew this could happen lol. pls blizz
---
I prefer playing the game
---
It’s sad that actual Classic fans have to watch the flow of bandwagoners destroy the game.
---
If the rage happened 2 months ago they may have changed layering.
---
Now, I fear layering is here to stay and it’s too late to do anything. 
---
Every moron in the sub was defending it, Blizz probably thinks we like it, and yet it was so simple to see how this shit would be exploited.

Why don't you try being something you're not in real life? For example, you could be likable or successful.
---
Without layering - competing against 400 people for quests. 
---
With layering - competing against 400 people for quests. 
---
How is that different?
---
It has to be the whole Continent. Otherwise you get sharding. Leaving an uncontested zone for a contested one will get you sharding in and out, destroying wPvp etc
---
Error 37
---
people do care if it crashes
---
Quite sure you can use it to leave combat
---
100%.
---
*Anything* beats layering because the Classic world balances on a precarious tightrope around rate resources like black lotus, devilsaur, arena grandmaster, etc
---
If you suddenly introduce 2-3-7x as many of those, economy will be fucking garbage.
---
Anyone who defends layering doesn’t understand the Classic wow economy.
---
I don't like the idea of having 1000 people in my screen when leveling. I won't be able to do anything.
---
and what is your solution to the 50%+ tourist population per server that blizz expects?
---
let's say a healthy server has ~3k pop. do you want them to increase server population limit to 6k? do you think that would be more fun (especially in the starting zones) than to have layering?
---
What did I do?
---
Ion said 3000-3500. It’s in an interview. 200 is not even close. You’re confusing sharding and layering
---
Those are all causes that lead into the same end point -- anonymity. A lack if responsibility also means there are less, if not none at all, incentives to be liked within a community
---
Yeah me too.
---
I thought it was a beta invite at first tho...
---
I see it as a one-time experience. Would 15k people all crammed into the same server for the first week slow down leveling? Of course, but it would also be a unique, hilarious, and unrepeatable experience. I think it would make for much more socializing while we wait on mobs, new creative leveling strats would arise, and the world would feel alive like an mmo should.
---
I don't want the 'optimal' server experience just so I can speedrun to 60 in the first week. I want a fun experience, and a packed server would be much better than layering on that front.
---
To a point, until you become a flat earther who refuses to listen to anyone. It's not always black and white.

---
I agree that at MOST they should cap servers to 3 layers, but Ion said in one of those interviews some servers could have up to 10 layers. That’s where it gets unplayable
---
i would swap improved imp for demonic embrace, early on life tap is essenatial and more health is always nice. when you get imp vw you dont really need the imp anymore.
---
I don't think that will be a huge problem on beta servers. 
---
The reason it kills live is because so many servers got a reputation for being a Horde/Alli server, you can look up the stats for each one, etc... Most people don't willingly join a server they know they will be at a disadvantage.
---
Smooth is a good time. Real passionate about Classic too.
---
Identify areas where it can be exploited. When a player enters one of these areas activate something like a pvp flag with say a 2-3 min cooldown. The player then cant change layers until the flag expires?
---
Would make it very simple to update exploitable areas as they are discovered.
---
She is an undead elf so it makes sense
---
You know oddly enough, one of the solutions to playing without layering, is just to have less people play at the same time so...
---
Let's do it &lt;throws out layering out of the window&gt;
---
Druid Hunter is a great leveling combo as the druid can bear tank, the hunters pet can tank, and both can do good DPS (and the druid can pop some heals too). 
---
As a druid / Hunter, you could easily grind in instances. Bosses would be a little tough, but doable if you slightly out level the instance. But a great pair for grinding together, especially after the hunter gets a good tanking pet.
---
There’s still a huge group of people out there that defend layering because they think Blizzard can do no wrong and they implicitly trust them.
---
This sub is now filled with those Diehard Blizz Fans looking for the next bandwagon to jump on. They defend layering to their last breathe, they’ll play Classic for 2 weeks, they’ll leave, and we’ll be left with an economy in shambles because no-life guilds will rape Black Lotus and other resources within 5 days
---
The Arena is not the problem here... the jumping between layers is!
---
server splits are a no-go.
---
they could allow for slightly bigger servers than the original 3k, or free realm transfers.
---
I don't think spell power is necessary. An easy way to get mp5 is the two dire maul trinkets though.
---
Shit, I play on Horde on an Alliance dominated server now, and they still won't PVP.
---
Maybe I don’t quite understand layering, but couldn’t Blizzard just introduce a very small pool of servers to choose from, this allowing them to fill up the world?
---
Sick insult. 
---
It’s not server capacity they have an issue you with. It’s the amount of servers they have an issue with. They don’t want to deal with hosting MORE servers, and they don’t want to deal with paying CSEs to handle all the people who had their low pop server merge and lost the name Aryastark. They literally laid off like hundreds of CSEs this year. It’s totally a cost cutting measure, but okay bud
---
*streamers: If sharding is in the game, I won't play Classic!
---
*blizzard: Here is beta key with layering
---
*streamers: Layering is fine and gucci guys! Don't forget to sub!
---
*venruki: shows how layering is actually worse than sharding
---
*streamers: Was actually talking about the potential of this today
---
Amazing zone, aye.  Loved it on all my other characters - especially all the Nintendo references and the pretty cave behind the camp.
---
No, because no one wants to have a 3 min intense pvp battle only to have a black lotus disappear in front of them
---
No one wants to have a 20 minute arena fight when the chest will simply vanish because one layer had no competition
---
Layering itself needs to go. It *cannot* be for the whole world.
---
You’re going to have 1000 people with layering my friend. Layers are 3.5k large, per continent. The barrens will literally have around 1000 people in it
---
This is god's work. Keep it up
---
Coming soon to a server near you!
---
10,000 people wouldn’t be on a server if they stuck to vanilla server sizes. And there’s not a huge difference between questing with 10k and questing with 1k. You’re gonna have a bad time either way
---
Love this. Would instantly fix any possible abuse.
---
Man it's been a long time but I think we ended up friends on Facebook eventually and would just chat every now and again, crossed paths in the city for work/uni. 
---
You've got me working the old memory box pretty hard haha
---
i wouldn't add BloodFury and axe spec. 
---
Axe spec is extremely minimal for hunters, and Blood fury only works on melee attacks, so i guess you can pop it before raptor strike, just keep in mind the self MS effect it comes with for 20 seconds
---
Ooga gang is doing the people's work. These streamers ask for gold, they ask for mats, they deserve the wrath of ooga.
---
Okay. I take everything I've said about layering back.
---
This is bullshit and shouldn't be in the game passed the starting zone.
---
For dungeons overpower / ww is worth it with proper gear, since revenge is capped and will only cause more threat if you either crit or stun ( talent ).
---
For raids i wouldn't advise it unless you have threat to spare, especially because you need a high damage weapon for it to be worth it : &gt;
---
I have stance dance / skill macros for this purpose alone.
---
Thinking RFC at like 17ish and SFK at 23ish. What you think? 
---
Should be manageable with two tanks and we can swap taunts
---
yesssss his videos where my shit, after watching one of them (i forget which as its been a while) it made me wanna play a belf warlock so id keep making trial accounts over and over each time i hit the level cap, i was 8 or 9 at the time
---
What's cool about it?
---
Just make some areas around special objects non-layered/cross-layer. Get within 200 yards of the arena chest? You're now in layer number 1. Get close to prince stuntrinket mcnagaface? Layer number 1. Close to the black lotus? Layer number 1.
---
Right? It's really simple and would fix a lot.
---
The old fashioned way of doing it was just people logging in and not getting anything done. Ask a veteran what they used to do on releases and most said “waiting two weeks to play the game”
---
If the servers are packed on release, the people who really want classic will play when they can. The people who don’t want to wait weren’t going to play to 60 anyway.
---
My main issue with gnomes is their nauseating camera height (they're also ugly and look like shit in all gear, but I'd be willing to ignore that for the racials, if not for the camera).
---
I really hope that is the case
---
You know there’s only one beta server, but there’ll be many classic servers?
---
Didn‘t Blizzard already confirm it will be taken out of the game completely eventually?
---
If it won‘t surpass the timespan of 2 weeks, there shouldn‘t be any major impact on the server economy.
---
Lmao, I got downvoted for MATH.
---
This sub sometimes...
---
You are saying large instanced areas are completely different from small instanced areas. The only thing you need to explain is how blizz got you to suck their junk.
---
to be honest, you have loads to do. Getting to 60, getting some good gear. leveling your professions (ie Engineering) if purely PVP focused.  Even playing hard core, you wouldnt have that all maxed out till November. 
---
Try some raids to get better gear. Even once the PVP rewards are released, it'll take you 6-8 weeks to get to Rank 10, meaning if you are correct that release 2 is Jan 2020 - then you'd not have good gear till end of Feb at the earliest.
---
Layering isn't because of high server pop. The servers blizzard has can handle 5-10k players, no problem. The issue comes when 5k people are in tee exact same area.
---
So layering isn't here to give us bigger overall server populations or the ability to have more people on a server. It's here to have the ability to have more people in the same zone. Layering had nothing to do with max server population and won't help with any kind of queue issues.
---
For real though of anyone says the Vanilla model of Sylvanas is better they're lying to themselves.
---
Its more like 1500 vs 3000+ from my understanding but ok.
---
They're the game designers supposedly, they're supposed to know and decide this stuff, not the players.
---
Guess I'm sticking to private servers. Another disappointment in video games.
---
One of the only things BFA has that's better.
---
Swipe won't hit the same three targets every time.
---
I get that. But is there a chance I won’t make it into the core raiding team as a Druid because I can only attend 80% of the raids?
---
It seems silly but I hope you get what I mean.
---
1. unlocked special quests and areas for further content
---
2. Naxx made every raid earlyer useless
---
3. Winterspring and EPL made Westfall and Barrens useless.
---
4. An attempt that went wrong, but a change was needed and it was an honnest attempt.
---
5. Oh cmon really?
---
Tbc was the better game.
---
Yes, let’s drag out dire maul release for 6 months. We can wait 4 years for naxx. Genius plan!
---
Everyone’s talking about how Classic is “all about being in the world with your friends” then we get into it and what used to be one world (a server) is split into multiple invisible worlds..
---
Well, what's the other solution? Server merges? I'd rather accept layering for a short time than have entire servers merged later on. Player numbers will drop, that's not up to question, and Blizzard needs some form to deal with the then half empty servers. Either they use layering and have bigger servers to begin with, or they merge them later.
---
It doesn't take much "convincing" to avoid server merges, as long as they fix most of the remaining layering issues.
---
Yeah, most character models did improve. The game itself on the other hand...
---
Link to the interview? I'm not confusing anything since it's the same thing only sharding is cross-server. Best thing Blizzard did was relabel sharding so keyboard warriors argue semantics.
---
You know the layering is only for phase 1, right?
---
With only PvP you can get good items for half of your slots, but the r12-14 gear gets replaced with AQ and naxx for most classes. You usually take some parts of it, but most of the best PvP gear is from raids.
---
There were two level 20 orcs in Dub Algaz that should have been a block, maybe someone killed them before you arrived. Well done for the Wetlands run.
---
Does wall walking exist in the beta? 
---
Can see people fucking off on AV and doing huge exploratory trips.
---
https://youtu.be/O3b423uqrdo
---
Starts at 4:30. There’s another one with Ion. I’ll find it
---
So why do we need new AV
---
Sorry I'm not somewhere I can watch YouTube videos, and my understanding of your post:
---
&gt;Most people who do this either die in the way (like a guy in the video)
---
lead me to believe it was a video of someone using the standard "die a lot" method of getting there, and that you were asking if there was another way.
---
Shamans can absolutely tank heal but tend to get shunted to raid heal where possible/needed due to having chain heal which is probably the best group heal in Vanilla. Priest is more of a jack of all trades and can raid heal or tank heal and has a lot more tools available, but as you note, that also makes them more complex. They also don't make much use of PW:Shield due to it being v.inefficient on mana and because for raids you will be holy spec anyway.  Both bring good buffs for raids from totems and BL to Stam/Sprt buffs. My advice would be to go for the class that interests you the most, as both are perfectly viable and in demand.
---
God, he's such a puss.
---
THROUGH THE FIRE AND FLAME WE CARRY ON
---
You don’t like the idea that one server is essentially 3 or 4?  (/s)
---
How did the game decide that when Nasitra took the walk over there, she would be in a different layer all alone? Is it just random? Is it a max cap of players per zone per layer? How does it work? Why even have it? If me and my mate are in the same place on the same server, we should see the same thing and eachother - always, right?
---
Did someone break the bad news to the companies?!
---
I am sure they can make a nice casket filling from all the money they are still making off these games...
---
It is pretty insane why they need layers to apply to the whole world. 
---
Could they really not think of a better alternative to merging servers than sacrificing immersion in a game *based around immersion*?
---
Mythic+ is mostly considered a success I believe! Sure it gets boring doing the same dungeons of course but it 100% adds life to the content.  A huge isssue is the rewards for compelteing genuinely difficult content is not much better than afking in a warfront...
---
I remember there being a certain point where you could jump off the zeppelin and not suffer fall damage... anyone confirm?
---
Why are you being downvoted XD
---
You can have a DS/Ruin build and only spam Shadowbolt the entire raid
---
Maaaybe throw out a curse if the raid asks for it
---
Oh and just have some Soulshards ready to friendly hand out HS and SS to raid members and summoning them :)
---
Yeah, It is really simple compared to the Onyxia one (witch is not bad either really).. Its just because the quest chain is called "Attunement to the Core" and was the first it is very ioconic and where the word attunement in the sence of raidin even comes from :)
---
Some people who played beta for less than a day already had issues suddenly zoning into new layers when grouping in caves, etc, and wiping. 
---
I am super worried about the current state of layering
---
Yeah I dont get it either. Apparently you cannot express opinions here.
---
I’d rather Blizz’s weird “connected servers” feature and have Jimbob - Stormrage merged with Jimbob - Frostmourne because the servers died out.
---
If we have to choose between crap and shit, i’ll take the one that doesn’t ravage the economy and undermine the integrity of the (layered) World of Warcraft.
---
Yha totally agree sharding for first copple of days in low level areas sounds like the way to go.
---
Level boost is one of those things that, even if everything else about Classic was great, would just make me stop playing and cancel my subscription. I don't think I'd feel angry if they included it, just sad and dissapointed about what could have been, dirtied by one single yucky thing.
---
That defeats the whole purpose :P
---
I'm just trying to help you understand the difference between the two systems, they have some similarities but some fundamental differences that set them apart. As I said I don't know how to explain it any simplier, there are some YouTube videos that do a decent job visualising it that might help you, I'd find you an example but I'm on my mobile at the moment.
---
Phase 1 should and will be the longest while everyone levels, gears up and raids. If you believe Blizzard are going to release P2 in 2019 while the majority of players haven't beaten Rag you're hilariously confused. Doesn't matter how easy everything is, it's time. They're not catering exclusively to pserver neckbeards who will have MC on farm in 2 weeks.
---
\*Full of Americans  
---
Humour from the British does not translate well for our friends across the pond. We treat sarcasm much more subtly than most of the world.
---
Yeah I read a similar comment.
---
The guy was in a cave right next to another guy, just them two. He invited him, suddenly *both* of them were sent to a new layer, instantly aggroed like 4 mobs, both wiped.
---
What a mess
---
Uh, that isn't even remotely a viable way of doing it. That is mathematically, statistically and logically flawed.
---
So...every game is dead compared to Fortnite because all of them are not as popular?
---
Stancedancing to use overpower or thunderclap is valid in dungeons. But I wouldn't really recommend doing it against raid-bosses.
---
I'd only use Shield Slam if the target already has 5 sunders and demo-shout. It might generate more threat but sunders also boost damage for everyone who does physical damage, so the only thing with a higher priority than sundering should be Revenge.
---
Whether to use Shield-block depends. Just like HS it's not on your GCD, so it's a rage-dump of some sort. But one that decreases your damage taken as opposed to increasing your threat generated. The main advantage is not the often measly amount of damage blocked but that a blocked attack cannot be a crushing-blow (150% damage) or a crit (200% damage, but yes, you should be crit-immune even without blocking by having enough defense) at the same time, which makes your damage intake much smoother.
---
If my health looks a bit troublesome I would actually prioritize Shield Block even before sunder armor... I won't hold aggro when I'm dead.
---
I honestly hope that both wow mouse and keyboards will be produced again, just a little better quality ofc :)
---
To test it, discover bugs, fix them - before launch.
---
Vanilla server had around 3k. 
---
So 1500 for horde/alliance 
---
Horde;
---
Tauren 300
---
UD 500
---
Orc/troll 700
---
The 400 was an average. Once you hit the barrens it’s more like 1000. And if you want to get super technical, because layer is continent only, you’re looking at more like 2200 because starting zones for alliance and horde are on the opposite continents for 75% of races. 
---
Without layering, it would just be your standing 300/500/700 *if* your server was completely full. With layering, all servers will be completely full because that’s the point.
---
Considering that they have consistently been doing so for the past few years, I am pretty confident taking that bet.
---
I hope you are wrong :(
---
It's the beta, let them polish it some more.
---
Everyone in this thread keeps calling them Deviants, but its actually Deviate.
---
Then you get phasing as you move into or out of sharded areas and you have exactly the same people complaining about a different issue.
---
I don’t get how Blizz keeps making mistakes like this after the whole “Don’t you guys have phones?”
---
Very nice random assumption based on.. nothing. I just find it hilarious how you state "I KNEW IT WOULD BE BAD!!!" as if everyone didn't know that already, the only question was to what extent.
---
Let your voice be heard, especially in regards to the level boost option. If you're against it: make sure you vote.
---
[No.](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=20580/shadowmeld#comments)
---
Another idea, involving far less complexity, is to allow layer hopping in capital cities only.
---
If you can pay for an advantage, the game is P2W, end of story.
---
Well the AV server will probably be a PvE one so players can make characters of both factions.
---
This is awesome, and it's what Classic is all about!
---
WotLK ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
That Quest in STV where you have to collect the bones of Bloodscalp trolls
---
The drop rare is furiously low
---
«All of them»
---
This is not widespread knowledge and there's no source.
---
When you order a horde banner and they send you an alliance banner by mistake.
---
Hope it gets sorted soon mate :'(
---
Isn't this that psychopath from John Oliver that wants to attack us with baseball bats?
---
The bouncing one. Obviously
---
Yup. OP clearly bases his data on private servers that have massive gold inflation due to DME/BRD farming. That said, classic might turn out to be the same if Blizzard doesn't address instanced goldfarming.
---
What’s layering?
---
There's no mention of layer size here, only that it's "dynamic and flexible". So, back to sharding we go.
---
yikes
---
http://i.imgur.com/PA5Xw3N.jpg
---
I hate the argument that layering *needs* to be done for server merge purposes.
---
That argument always boils down to: well it’s hard to merge when people have the same name.
---
Simply tie names of 5 regular servers together that you intend to merge down the line.
---
Less names? Yes. *So what*. The alternative is you have incessant bugs to fix and inevitable bugs that will slip through and people will rape layering. Besides their attention should be cleaning up the OTHER bugs from classic beta.
---
Layering has created *more* work for Blizz, more bugs, and should simply be removed. The person responsible for it should be fired
---
And that's exactly why blizzard is trying very hard to give us "true vanilla".
---
They don't want private servers to take potential customers and money and there's plenty of evidence that vanilla wow is very popular.
---
Now, I don't think they will hit the 10+m subs again, like the glory times. But we can expect hundreds of thousands to log in, maybe even millions, during the first couple of months.
---
What happens after, we can only guesstimate.
---
Layering us for a month or less. It will be fine. You people need to stop freaking out over nothing.
---
They have definitively said they will remove layers after a few weeks or at the latest before the next phase. Working off of the assumption that they'll NOT do what they've said they will is actually absurd. The backlash that would ensue is not something they'd be able to handle. How about you create this fake outrage IF they go back on their word, not when the servers haven't even been released yet.
---
&gt;You don't need to be 60. They need lvl 60 tanks I guess, but other than that I think it's doable even before 60.
---
Maybe, because the raid is so easy itself you might see some attempts at lower levels, but the penalty for not being 60 is huge.. The dps gain from spells and auto-attacks not missing against essentially lvl.63 bosses is huge.
---
Tanks are defenetly 60 because that extra defense and threat is essentially for the entire guilds "well-being".
---
The only ones where level does not matter is for healers as their heals cannot miss and since you are rarely using max rank heals anyway, even a level 50 healer with enough consumables will be a huge asset to the raid.
---
Yeah, that’s definitely true.
---
"...Instead of balancing players around shards of zones and combining  players from multiple realms, layering will allow realms to create a  separate instance of themselves to balance their own population.  However, unlike sharding once in a layer, players won't leave this layer  in favor of a better one whenever they move or change zones, removing  the awkward phasing present in retail. The only way to change a layer  will be to enter a group, which will have all players from the group in  the same layer."  
---
It means that you can exploit switching layers by getting a group invite from someone on a different layer.  
---
If you watch closely, the other players disappear as soon as he accepts the invite and now he can loot the free chest from the other layer.
---
Read the following comment down doofus.
---
Is this embarrassing for you that you’re so pompous in your response but you’re wrong? Like, what does this humility feel like? Are you going to apologize for being ignorant and insulting “keyboard warrior semantics?” Or are you going to disappear like the little bitch you are?
---
Or maybe they want to know if people actually wanted to level, or will just buy a boost. So that they don't reduce leveling speed and people shit on them for being "money-grabbing assholes". Just like when they removed a few portals.
---
Ah yes, I would absolutely love to sit in a 6h queue upon launch. Why would I want to play the game anyway? It wouldn't be some 15 minute queue. People are so naive about the absolute shitshow the queue would be.
---
People who say “stop being a baby layering will only be a month or less” have *no clue* how quickly no-lifers can reach 60 and how fragile the Classic wow economy is. Change my mind.
---
If I were you just wait 3-6 months untill you start playing classic. At that point most of the layering issue should be gone
---
[This survey](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b4wz4u/distribution_of_race_and_class_according_to/) and pserver data are the best guesses we have. Hunters are less popular than Mage, Rogues, and Warriors in both.
---
It's true that Alliance will have fewer warlocks.
---
April 2025 as a Mage. With avg 1h/week.  Which would cost me almost 1000 $ by then. Oh boy.
---
I understand this is to gauge feedback, but my god I hope the playerbase puts them in the place with this shit.
---
Phase 1 is enough time for dedicated players to get to 60 and put enough Blotus and Ghost Mushroom to ruin Herb economy for a long time..
---
Layering could be in for a day and it would ruin the economy.
---
Did you guys kiss?
---
Me? I'll be smoking weed, drinking and not sleeping for 7 days during launch then fling myself groggily back into my day job...
---
Since it runs off of a 7.3.5 client, no. Walljumping isn't a thing
---
Thanks for the suggestion. Really enjoying his content.
---
What kind of work do you do where they limit internet access like that?
---
&gt;I recently leveled a hunter 1-20 on a pserver and my god are levels 5-10 awful.
---
Level 5-10 as a hunter are faster than most other classes. This whole "hunters sucks before pet" is just because people lack the most basic skills needed for a hunter.  Shoot, kite, shoot, kite and so on. If a mob should live when he gets to you a Raptor Strike kills it.
---
You essentially got the benefits of casters without having to drink.
---
The whole reason I play WoW is to be a “goblin” - my main game is to watch market fluctuations and make money from it..
---
Watching the herbing / alch economy tank because of layering will ruin my enjoyment of the game long after its removed. Especially considering I was planning on running Herb / Alch on my main - this greatly affects me.
---
It’s true. If layering stays for an entire month, R.I.P. economy of high end resources 
---
Whatever guild no-life’s it, and plenty will as we’ve seen from pserver, they will have 2-3 *potential weeks* of unfettered economic pillaging.
---
Flasks are supposed to be hard to come by and cost as much as a mount because of how powerful they are. Yet, many people defending layering don’t even know about flasks in Classic. Doesn’t that tell you something?
---
MN and Tribe bitch too much. I'd rather watch perplexity
---
The purpose of the beta is to test these things among others, I assume you reported the bug before you came to reddit? I am pretty sure Blizzard doesnt check for bug reports on Reddit.
---
Yaaaaasss arena grand master at level 1 on release confirmed thank u blizzard xo
---
They should make it the meeting stone so they actually have a function.
---
And that is why people need to report bugs. Because it's "the beta".
---
Agreed. What’s amazing is that they are all from Liverpool!
---
they will sure as shit will do something about this  
---
^^^^^^^^^^right?
---
Well.. I quit in WotLK but I've seen some videos of newer stuff and even there.. What did they do to my boy Thrall.  Okay, yeah. Most models but.. Thrall. What happened to you..
---
I did really like new Voljin and I do really like new Sylvanas.
---
&gt;Yeah I read a similar comment.
---
I see you are a expert. Most players will not even NOTICE the fucking thing, ever. If you had phasing, it wouldnt be any better. The complaints might just be slightly different.
---
&gt;Went well up until Razergore or whatever the 3rd boss is called.
---
Broodlord Lashlayer. And honestly, if you wiped me and forced me to go through the suppression room again because you didn't know what the fuck was going on with pet commands I would have wanted you out the raid
---
Got ya! Thanks alot
---
I agree, I'm just nervous that everyone will assume the aggressive layering we have now will be present at launch. Might not be the case.
---
They are 100s of gold without BoP Blotus - your suggestion would make them cost 500-1000..
---
Layers KEEPS immersion, phasing destroys it.
---
they are pride of troll nation
---
Yup
---
My bad I get you now!
---
Fair enough.
---
&gt;  If you were really worried about min-maxing your raid healing you wouldn't be playing druid in the first place. 
---
Nice one :'), but hey... every raid brings a Druid or two!
---
Your time quoting that obvious statement would have been better spent trying to find out to what extent its going to be bad.
---
That's my point.
---
&gt;Everything my level can kill me before I kill it if I can’t kite it.
---
Then kite it. That is like, hunter 101. You can always kite just be somewhat aware of your surroundings. It's really not that hard.
---
Even caves you can kite in, it is not like you have to kite far and you can just kite backwards to where you already cleared. Literally the only time it is a problem is with extreme dynamic respawns so caves fill up too fast, but that has nothing to do with vanilla.
---
Damn your just so fucking wrong and up your arse you cant see it. god forbid there be more than 1 tanking spec and anything but warrior having 2 viable specs. Jesus christ.
---
That would alleviate initial rush, it wouldn’t allow for exploits of end-game resources, and wouldn’t require as much bug-fixing as layering.
---
Honestly the last part has me most worried. So many bugs on layering. And devs need all the time they can get on actual games bugs. Hunters still have loads of glitches with their pets, and now devs have to drop everything to fix layering exploits!
---
Well yeah then you are fucked unless Blizzard comes up with some new solution to the problem.
---
It’s for a few weeks only, it’s won’t effect you mostly. Don’t worry about it
---
Got to level 32 on my first toon, a warrior, before finding out about talent points and trees.
---
We don't know since the game isn't released. But let's just pretend the whole world is going under since some shit is happening on a *BETA*.
---
ooga chakka ooga ooga ooga chakka
---
The question about lvl boost is 100% for NEW PLAYERS joining the live WoW version.
---
It does take between 100-120 hours for a brand new player to level from 1 to 120. A full heirloom geared player will do it in half the time.
---
Blizzard is expecting that some of the new players that will join WoW for the first time, because of Classic, to TRY also BfA, and I am sure many of them WILL buy a character boost in BfA.
---
This is beyond stupid, but hey, the suits are doing what the suits are doing.
---
There won't be any character boost for Classic, at least for the foreseeable future. The leveling experience in live WoW is basically non-existing, and only drives new players away from the game. At this point, to be honest, removing leveling from live WoW won't be a big deal at all.
---
BUT...why not keep it AND make some nice cash?
---
I did. It didn't make your position any better.
---
What sort of things make it high skill ceiling? How is the hunter play style in PvP?
---
I'd be all up for this!
---
Adequate name.
---
How am I wrong when I ask for a simple source on layer size and you or anyone else aren't able to give one?
---
Nobody cares what you think. Its going to be what its going to be. Go make a 10min youtube video.
---
&gt; Layering applies to the whole world, allowing you to farm Black Lotus, Devilsaur, world Rare Spawns, other herb/mine nodes in lvl 60 areas
---
I see this comment all the time. Its all wildly based on people assuming that you get the same spawn rates of limited resources, aka that if you have 10 layers, it means that theres 10x black lotuses to be picked. IT CAN BE SETUP SO ONLY 1 LAYER WILL HAVE A LOTUS.
---
People care way too much about dps. Yes, a hardcore guild will try to min/max the raid, but for most people the biggest issue is going to reliably have 40 people ready each week. Rather have a few sub-optimal dps and be 40 guildies than having to find PuG people to fill the spots.
---
Layering is just rebranded sharding.. how any of the devs thought that this would work, is beyond me. Launch servers and consolidate. Layering will be abused. There’s no way to stop abuse from happening. There is no possible solution. They have had it on retail for over a decade and it’s still abused to this day. There is no reason for laying other than the shitty argument of over population. If people don’t want overpopulation, then go play something else. Adding a feature that was not present during vanilla such as “layering”, is going to destroy economies and ruin any sort of world pvp. And if the devs can’t see that, why the hell are the devs? Low lvl herb farming? Low lvl mining? How about bots farming low lvl zones in layer #4? Or a raid on goldshire or xroads happening on layer #2? How am I supposed to report the bots or join in a world pvp event if “they layer is over crowded”. It’s fucking stupid and ruins the point of having any sort of community outside a capital city. No more camping BRM for an hour or two before my raid because the opposing guild got layered to #3 while I’m sitting on #1.. no more attacking goldshire because I got layered to #3 due to over population. No more low lvl world pvp events in STV such as horde owning nessingwary for a couple hours because well, I can just switch layers and go to nessingwary with no worries..   
---
   
---
Did they think any of this through? Or are they so worried about overpopulation that they are willing to completely destroy the sense of community?
---
but not night elf, she's an undead high elf
---
The Wrath one was the best, looked most like her WC3 model
---
It’s beta.  It’s for testing. Not entertainment.
---
i remember ZG bats were nuts when they got introduced, absolutely recking cloth in AV
---
Lol god damn I forgot about the CS days.. those were the damn days, bois
---
I prefer the real sylvanis.
---
As lame as it seems I might be one of those people sticking to Vanilla pservers. No interest in a game with such little foresight. I’ve wanted these servers for close to a decade (BC era) so this is a huge dissappointment.
---
When the "You think you want, but you don't" event happened, i thought "you know... that is bold but he is probably right"
---
And here I am now, counting days :D
---
&gt;Never saw that in vanilla though did ya
---
Except it isn't
---
Rune of the Guard Captain on horde, lvl 45ish quest and its miles better
---
Devilsaur Eye for both Alliance and Horde off the lvl 50 ST quest, and is basically the only reward worth taking. This is not available P1 on servers like Nostalrius but it looks like they will be available for retail classic as they just seem to limit dungeons, not quest rewards.
---
How mature can you be when you think it's funny to insult people using terms that are not an insult, but a legitimate disorder, thereby putting down any and all people who suffer from this certain disorder?
---
I'll answer that for you, since it probably surpasses your mental capacity: Not mature at all, that's the shit little kids find funny. Are you a litle kid, which has not yet developed empathy? If yes, go and play fucking Fortnite like the rest of you stupid kids. If not, go and play fucking Fortnite with the rest of the stupid kiddies, you fit in with them quite well.
---
Did you report this or just post here
---
Source?
---
Go play HoTs and PUBG
---
Ok fine.. semi hardcore it is... Geez, that's just a minor detail. It's not a big deal.
---
If your aim is to play warlock and PvP - go horde
---
I see your point about concurrent vs total population numbers, I hadn't considered that, but what I'm curious about is how many servers they plan on having at launch.   
---
As you can see here,  [https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/1109832561704878081](https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/1109832561704878081)  , Ion states they'll " start with lean realmlists and expand as needed, just as the 2004 launch did. ", and the original launch started with 89 servers on US, seen here :  [https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Timeline\_of\_the\_creation\_of\_US\_realms](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Timeline_of_the_creation_of_US_realms)   
---
I see lots of people throwing around server numbers of 8-9, which to me just seems to be the exact opposite of what Ion says in his tweet. Obviously with the implementation of layering, this changes things, but if he sticks true to his word there will be a lot more than \~10 realms on launch.
---
While true, the bad scaling on hunters in pve has nothing to do with that. Hunter burst stays insane till the end which is what counts in pvp.
---
Yea and entertainment keeps players. Do you really think that most of the beta players are playing for testing instead of having fun playing a great game?
---
https://youtu.be/jYuUD0o-Nz8
---
Here you go dick nose. Start at 5:30. From Ions mouth. I’m waiting for your apology
---
I don't believe its only for phase 1. Blizzard is only saying it becuase they know that otherwise a lot of players wouldn't even try Classic. There is still no logical solution to what happens when phase 1 is over and server population is still much bigger than it should be. Predicting how many players quit before phase 2 is pure guesswork, its always wrong. If they don't want to end up with dead and/or massively overpopulated servers they WILL have to extend layering past phase 1. They just think (and somewhat rightfully) that players who invest so much of their time and effort into Classic won't quit in phase 2 just because layering is to stay, especially after they experienced it in phase 1.
---
It is NOT for Classic. This level boost question is directly for NEW players that will join WoW because of Classic popularity, and will also try BfA.
---
THAT is the target audience for level boost.
---
One being immature does not make the other mature. You're both immature.
---
It has a chance to be resisted just so u know

What’s gummy’s connection to this?

Sorry but that's not true, it's impossible to completely "ruin" the economy in a day when people also start leveling. It might skew the economy in a bit but it will definitely correct itself in a weeks time. (However I do agree that if layering were to be there for the entirety of phase 1, it would be as problematic like you say)
---
Yeah i cannot find any info on the phases actually phasing out quests and quest rewards, both of the items i mean came out post 1.4 but as far as i can see the phases only restrict the dungeons you can enter, not the quests. 
---
Sorry meant Devilsaur Eye

You can also download the free software "Autohotkey". You can use it at the same way. It's not the same as an ingame macro, but it is very helpfully.
---
If someone is forced to change server/name, they will have to pay their price for it. So there will be some sort of punishment as these are not for free. Do either this or create a new char. Having to lvl up to 60 again is not going to be that easy so I think ppl will think twice if they want to be dickheads or not...
---
For pvp. You gotta be joking.
---
Orc vs troll Is not even a question there and for pve it’s at least highly debatable what’s better
---
The damage was normalised so the dps is the same but the attack speed is still different, like weapons. At least according to petopia classic.

- Herod in SM

I occasionally play HotS. So do many other people. What's your point...?
---
A very good played hunter is indeed a pvp machine
---
People underestimate how long Bug Fixing takes for game developers.
---
Layering is a new system that is draining dev time and resource away from actually fixing Classic bugs with classes
---
That’s a big point I don’t see mentions often
---
This. This is an acceptable solution. Make it so you automatically switch to party leader's layer when you enter the rest zone.
---
People have a lot of misguided faith in Blizzard imo. I fail to see much they have done correctly in the last 5+ years..
---
I'd meet up at the Crossroads. Going from 1 to 12 in Mulgore will take you about 3-4 hours. You will spend a long time running to Durotar, time in which you could add some levels to your character.   
---
Plus as mention before here, class quests will be locked for you.
---
D E A D
---
Explain to me what I don't understand? You seem to be the confused one.
---
I have a better idea, one that will 100% guarantee no abuse.
---
Remove layering from the game completely. #nochanges
---
Lol. Layering keeps immersion when someone who you gank can join any random dungeon party from /world in 5 seconds and vanish? Lmao
---
Brb, getting something to drink.
---
Arhahahahaha! You numbnuts! Did you completely forget it was April Fools today? Hahahahaha! I didn't even get anything to drink. Only something to eat! Cannot believe you fell for it, lawlern00g.
---
Kneel, Peasants!
---
Can someone explain what's happening here or what "layering" is? Can't with sound atm so apologies if its explained in the video
---
I got permabanned for saying “more OOGA” when they were ganging him..haha
---
Then wait layer is gone ?
---
&gt;Maybe I should roll a "beginner friendly" class in Vanilla? Simpler rotation, more forgiving? 
---
Well, rotations are not at all like in BfA. Mage is literally just spamming one spell (Frostbolt), then in later raids you change to Fireball. Rogue has a bit of a rotation (essentially spamming Sinister Strike for combo points. Use CP to keep up your Slice and Dice buff, then dump any extra CP into Eviscerate).
---
Honestly, from what you say both are fine. The only little thing might be that mages are generally better in BG's, since they don't rely on CD's as much as rogues. The problem in a BG is if you are only useful with CD, then most of the time you are useless. For wPvP you can just wait for CD, so it is not an issue and both are great in PvE.
---
&gt;Maybe I'll have 2 friends playing with me, but thats not guaranteed. And one of them is definitely rolling a Rogue. 
---
This is what I'd base my choice on. Two rogues means you don't get a combined bigger toolkit, just more of the same. It also means you will both need the same gear, which can be a bit bothersome. Going mage means you never have to compete with gear and you get a way bigger toolkit. This is not to say rogue / rogue is bad, it can be really fun to be two rogues, but I'd still vote for mage / rogue.
---
Already explained in this thread why you should worry even if it’s only a month. No-life guilds will be farming shit after a week in 60 zones. They’d have 3 straight weeks with no competition to do that.
---
Why does layering *need* to apply to 60 zones anyway if no one will be there?
---
Does anyone remember Sharm?  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai9-C\_TisPk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai9-C_TisPk)
---
why would you compare it to fortnite?
---
Fortnite &amp; LoL are so far above everyone else it isnt even close.
---
WoW currently sits a little behind Dota in popularity which has on average 500k players on at a time going up to a million during peak hours.
---
Gives you a pretty good idea of how many people are playing WoW and they are still reasonably good numbers for a game that you have to sub too.
---
The infographic feels like saying Classic is a downgraded version instead of an alternative version
---
I personally feel Classic gameplay and design are much more well-thought. It's simply a masterpiece
---
If this shit stays in the game your gona have all the rushers getting fast tidal charms - arena trinkets - all the devilsaurs - all the black lotus and mines and it's honestly gona ruin part of the game even if layering is only in for the first few weeks that's more than enough time to abuse it..
---
Blizz need to make it so only the non contested zones are layered like so like trisfall - silver pine - barrens then once you leave to go to contested zones layering turns off or better yet just fucking scrap layering and give us dynamic spawns like priv servers
---
&gt;IT CAN BE SETUP SO ONLY 1 LAYER WILL HAVE A LOTUS.
---
still problematic if the first lvl60s are unable to access that lotus.
---
You’re commenting on a post where a player gave an example they got shafted by layering in *one day*, and you’re saying most players will be ever experience it?
---
That's what blizzard are doing, layering is a temporary solution they're placing on top of the servers to ensure that there aren't 10000 humans all in northshire abbey trying to kill the same mob. Once the playerbase has spread out around the world they'll be reducing it and removing it.
---
&gt; why would you compare it to fortnite?
---
Because that is the method you wanted to apply.
---
&gt; Gives you a pretty good idea of how many people are playing WoW.
---
Gives you absolutely no idea about currently active subs though. Only how many of them are playing at any given time.
---
If you can't name people outside of your guild then you're not playing much are you? What exactly are you doing to find more people?
---
I PUG a lot of M+ runs. You get to know people. You become friends. You shit talk people. People shit talk you. Rivalry forms between who has better score/runs. If you can't name people outside of your guild, its a you problem. Community exists, its up to you whether you want to find them or not.
---
And phasing... it does exactly the same fucking thing. Ppl CRIED that no phasing. Now its no layering, phasing is amazing.
---
In phasing just going over a zone limit other players can disappear. In layering that cant happen. It can ONLY happen in when parties are in different layers. 
---
Most ppl will play solo most of the time, or party with ppl they can SEE around them. Aka, no layer change.
---
Even if that were the case, it only takes 1 phase to decimate the economy for the rest of the game by exploiting nodes.
---
Damn, you're right!
---
Lot of humans RP as humans
---
Because of beta people can find out exactly how and to what extent layering will affect the economy and immersion etc ...
---
I'm pretty sure that streamer Asmongloid said he's planning on getting a raid together to leave Stormwind. Some beta testers will go through extreme lengths to do anything but beta test. They're obviously doing this a whole weekend event so they can get sufficient information so it's not scuffed upon release. Kind of sad how one individual has the influence to negatively hamper queue times and avoid doing what the server is there for just so he can be a unique snowflake.
---
Underrated comment.
---
Dev attention will devoted to layering at a time when they need all cylinders firing on class bugs.
---
Oh you seem mad about something mate. Those pesky retail players... Always fucking the game for us the real GaMeRS.
---
&gt;a month or less
---
imagine how much damage some people could do to the gathering economy in that massive amount of time.
---
2 weeks? Ha, Americans. Europeans with 5-7 weeks vacation will have the advantage 2019!
---
I'm not saying it's the right course or anything, but layering solves a problem that vanilla did not have. A large amount of tourists are going to leave after a month or two. Layering allows you to scale down realms to have the appropriate amount of people after they leave.
---
Very curious about this myself. Most of my screenshots folder from vanilla -&gt; tbc retail and private servers is bugs and out-of-bounds exploration! 
---
I'd be interested to know about accessing places like Hyjal and Caverns of Time, especially because CoT should be accessible right now in the beta. Back in the day GMs would take issue with players accessing these places, I guess because they were spoilers for upcoming content. Unlikely that they'd take the same stance today? There's very little real in-game benefit to be made (out-of-bounds pvp is all I could think) but some properly broken stuff like jumping off the world is possible in the 1.12 client and world.
---
If layering is meant to help the initial rush then I don’t see why it has to apply to 60 zones as well.
---
&gt;and you may find that you complete them with less total exp earned (because things like "kill 20 bears" now means "kill 10 bears.... each"
---
at the same time quests like "get 10 bear livers" suddenly become "Get 20 bear livers"
---
Just like people survive far more dangerous shit.
---
How defensive!
---
The 7 days don’t sound too bad. GL for the time after that tho! Just remember that day job is never an absolute final destination - if you’d like to do something else
---
You live in switzerland too?
---
Are you going to be in this zones? If so you can change layer too. Whatever, I’m going to be casual as fuck. 
---
There’s going to be things aren’t perfect but I appreciate Blizzard doing their best and trying to give us Classic. Just try to enjoy it first, I don’t see why the default has to always be anger
---
Not the biggest, but I ninjaed an axe drop in Shadowfang Keep on my Rogue. I did not realise Rogues could not get the axe skill.
---
Sharding only applies to starter areas. This is acceptable given the crazy initial rush. 
---
There’s no reason to layer the whole world when only starter zones will be busy
---
Show me where he said that.
---
&gt; If the rage happened 2 months ago they may have changed layering.
---
To be honest though, we knew that sharding was going to happen since the reveal of Classic. I was firmly against it back then, because I have absolutely zero faith in Blizard. Today, we see evidence everywhere that their layering solution is as bad as retail sharding, despite people saying it wasn't and that the classic team was trustworthy. We were many who spoke out against sharding back then and that didn't help either. They changed it from "sharding" to "layering" and people were satisfied, but hopefully that stops now, with clear evidence that Blizzard once again lied to their community, instead of just being honest people.
---
I would happily take 5k population with queues for the first few weeks, instead of this layering crap. Sure it's annoying to start out, but once the dust settles, it's much easier to control than their current solution.
---
Agree. Every BWL guild will keep raiding MC as well. We raided at least 3 raids a week back then.
---
We just need to mass-downvote the bullshit comments. Keep scanning the threads and purge them.
---
Ah yes, the "I don't believe it, I know I'm right" route.
---
What is this
---
Icefrog please fix
---
Nobody is in the L60 areas, when everyone is in elwynn forest. It really doesnt matter. It made sense to blizzard to make it like this BECAUSE people complained about phasing.
---
This sub is trying to stop Blizz from making a huge mistake, you should want that. Even if you go casual layering will mean economic differences to you and issues whenever you join groups
---
I tamed the ghostly type night saber from darkshore one where you had to click idol or something as a tauren Hunter when it tamed it kept it's ghostly appearance but it also had a healing bug that it healed for a large amount every second was gone after the next server restart but it made leveling easy for a while back in the day.
---
Awww crap, I completely forgot about the murloc
---
So I am deciding between Rogue and Warrior
---
I started with TBC, so I never got into that classic feeling
---
I heard and read that rogues are pretty beastly in both PvE and PvP in Classic
---
However I also like to tank, especially as warrior with big shields and heavy armor
---
Also that would make me a thunderfury priority as well (and I love that weapon design)
---
I know rogues can use that sword as well but they arent as high in priority list as tank warriors are.
---
Any help? sooner or later will have both chars at 60 but I want to main one (I have mained every class in retail up until now at some point in my wow history )
---
Phase 2 is still the leveling/gearing up phase, it just includes an extra dungeon and some world raids.
---
My guild on live turned into a free trade of crafting goods for me and my GF.
---
There is no community left on live. After BFA I only recognized one player. And that was only because he has the first blizzcon mount. He sets on it all day and does nothing.
---
Even he doesn't chat back anymore.
---
Nice gay pride flag bro (:
---
Thank you bud, motivating! Good luck to you too!
---
I don't understand why they aren't taking the concept to its logical conclusion. 
---
* Let people pick the layer/realm they want to start playing on in advance, call them Aegwynn 1,2,3,...,n.
---
* Close the registration for each layer once a certain number of people, say, 2,5k, has been reached.
---
* Launch the game and see what happens.
---
* If one of the layers/realms drops in active population, merge the lowest populated layer with the second lowest populated server of the same pool.
---
* Tell everyone who wants to play with their friends, but chose to level on a different layer, to fuck off.
---
We can either have "you can play with anyone you'd like to" or "you can play in a consistent community", not both.
---
The bread vendor
---
Never did I say who was real gamers or not. I played WoW even after Blizzard fucked it over, since there wasn't anything better at any point. What I'm saying is that retail players accept the current condition of WoW and they now defend Blizzard again when they are lying, again.
---
When sharding was initially suggested for Classic, this subreddit was up in arms, absolutely shredding it. Later, when layering was announced to replace sharding, people somehow started to accept it. Coincidentally, the subreddit had also grown more than 50k since, with all the bandwagoners and retail players coming in, suddenly the opinion changed towards layering being an acceptable solution.
---
I am not sure how I seem mad to you, by having an opinion?
---
You could always keep your auto-attack on the mob that has been hit by fewest Swipes.
---
You have no clue what youre talking about.
---
It's funny how other games can do "layering" and people lose their minds, and blizzard does it and people applaud them. And yes server merges would be fine, we have done them for years and years and it has worked perfectly fine. 
---
We have reached a point where people are arguing server merges are worse then instancing the world. As an argument FOR instancing. This is truly Blizzaroworld.
---
I never get these survey emails :/
---
Did you even read the post
---
Rushers can hit 60 in 5-6 days. There doesn’t need to be layer if only 6 people are in a 60 zone. But those 6 people can hop between 10 layers and farm 10 zones easily while you take your time in elwynn.
---
Mad talent comes from Liverpool.
---
Welp sounds like alliance is never gonna clear Sunwell, But it doesnt matter cause horde is never gonna clear Hyjal. #Nochanges lol
---
&gt; lock a character permanently to a layer.  
---
You ever fly out to help a friend/guildie, or go to a summoning stone when you join a pug, only to find you can't see the other players because of Warmode? That's what layer locking would do. No thanks.
---
Maybe they should just treat doing crap like this as an exploit and punish those who are doing it, rather than get rid of the whole system because people can't seem to understand what its purpose actually is for and/or immediately look to how it can be abused.
---
*People* are the problem here, not the technology.  The fact the first thought of many is "How can I exploit this" speaks volumes for the type of people these are.
---
I wish I had 5-7 weeks vacation.. Fuck my boss.
---
I mean try stunlocking an orc warrior as a rogue and let me know how it goes. The reason you don’t see only orcs at “top end” pvp is because pvp rankings in classic are 100% about time investment and not about build quality, racials, or skill. It’s purely about honor per hour, and how many hours of your day you can afford you grind.
---
Horde has an edge in PvP
---
Alliance has an edge in PVE 
---
In BGs it's equal, hordes will instantly get their dots and fears dispelled if there is a paladin present and also have to deal with fearward while allies have to deal with wotf.
---
I'm personally going alliance because I think it's a unique and fun experience for a warlock.
---
"accident" lol its myspace all over again
---
The battle cry of the sheeply oppressed. "Ooo it's beta guiz" You people just never fucking learn do you? That's why you end up with shit on your lap constantly. 
---
Learn to hold companies responsible.
---
&gt;Also as a rogue the skill ceiling is EXTREMELY high, and per your post I think you will find their rotation very hard to master.
---
This is just not true. You literally only use 3 abilities for your rotation. Spam Sinister Strike, keep up SnD, dump access CP into Eviscerate. Sure it is more than just spamming Frostbolt on a mage, but that does not mean it is hard. Rogues are extremely easy in PvE just like pretty much all DPS in vanilla.
---
They got copyrighted, so they took out the music, idk where the og video with the right music is
---
In the situation I described above, there is no good solution. Unless someone can explain to me how they could guarantee an ideal-population server after 6 weeks, consistently, for every server, I don't see how "but they said they'd turn it off" is any help whatsoever. Cause it's no solution for a plausible scenario.
---
I'd gladly pay a cinema $15 for a movie ticket, and another $20 to not watch it and just read the spoilers. /s
---
&gt; I don't believe its only for phase 1.
---
Then you do not believe reality.
---
I’d like to begin my comment with hating on streamers and streamer “”””culture””””. That priest bowing down giving away loot is disgusting.
---
I don’t understand what is the need to have layering, why can’t we just have population servers set to 4-5k and servers automatically merge when they consistently remain in the 1-2 k range with each other ??  As someone pointed out, deal with name change drama better than ruining a core concept of the game....
---
What if I prefer her WC3 model?
---
I like this idea. Or maybe the idea that you have to do a dungeon before being able to enter the next dungeon.
---
What are you talking about? Do you not remember Wrathgate phasing that exclusively existed in part of a zone.
---
Exploiting nodes would require multiple layer hops though
---
It's actually amazing to me how many people around here are complaining about 1.12 AV and not being able to have games that last days.
---
It makes me wonder how many people here actually played the game back then. You may have some fond memories of it long ago in the same way that it's fun to share the story about the time you broke your arm when you fell off the ATV, but at the time it was an absolute sore spot on the game. People generally hated it and everyone rejoiced when the newer version of AV was put in the game. 
---
It may sound fun on paper to have these insane games, but after the novelty of it all wears off you are left with boring, uneventful, gridlock. The shit was not fun at all.
---
Well, that obviously would mean only 1 Layer which basically makes the whole System irrelevant. You also could only enable it in 1-5 Zones, just to help out with the first few hours.
---
At the End of the Day, if people can switch between Layers they will always find ways to abuse it.
---
I'm sorry for all of you guys that this is affecting you in a bad way. As for me, I'll be playing casually, everything in the game can be acquired without ever worrying about the economy of the game, with just plenty of grinding and co-operation.
---
I don't know how the 'economy' of the game works, and if it's fragile or not. I am looking forward to layering not being a thing in the game though. I will stay a casual who's blind to the bigger picture regarding game economy....hope it won't ruin the game experience for you guys though.
---
Spam clicking on my pets growl all the way to 60 because I didn't know you can put it on auto mode lol but hey, atleast it wasn't ninja pulling aggro in dungeons.
---
Blizzard had clearly stated many times that layering will only be for early leveling. What does black lotus or devilsaurs have to do with anything?
---
Nice
---
Ok, so first complaint was theres too many lotuses for first L60 ... and if you fix that then the complaint is that the first ones might miss few ? Well, people did whine about phasing for so much that blizzard did hear them out. No sharding, but not to have servers dying they came up with layering.
---
I dont think there is EVER a solution that everyone is happy with.
---
Um... It is just the beta? That's exactly what the beta is for. Finding bugs.
---
I'm against layering completely. I'd rather wait a few days to play than deal with the stuff layering introduces.
---
Anything "optimal" will see a lot of play simply because too many care too much about min/max without ever getting to such a hardcore raiding environment that it would matter. So things like human rogues and warriors.
---
Aside from that, undead mage and rogues. A bit less than the previous mentioned, but I still think there will be a lot of night elf hunters.
---
Yeah, I was thinking of going a Human Warlock, just because it's fun. Though I get what the previous guys have said PVP wise - WOTF is a pain though there are lots of locks on Horde compared to Alliance.
---
Meld allows you to drink as far as i remember, while melded, this is quite powerful in BGs and wPvP
---
Why are you being so melodramatic? You realize this clip is from the beta. That's exactly what the beta is for. Finding unintended things in the game. You see one bug and you freak out? You need to learn to relax a bit.
---
I see you've started using the smooth camera panning I suggested.
---
Very nice.
---
Looking forward to the rest of the series.
---
Because this is the fucking beta?
---
The character boost question is actually super concerning. 
---
120 hours is exactly 5 days /played. That is right around the mark that alot of people are shooting for to get their characters to 60 in classic.
---
I think this may alrdy be a thing. Last night a lot of us were dueling and I got a whisper that ask me to invite them to my layer. But after inviting them, I phased to their layer instead of them to mine.
---
I'm not sure why people are downvoting you. This is exactly right.
---
Hes wearing ironbark staff, WSG legs and the 4 piece blue pvp set, neck is spellpower neck from Molten core and cloak is spellpower from AV, band of sulfuras and WSG ring, weapon is enchanted with spellpower. I know this because I know that player it's Finalflash.
---
Late November (Warlock, slow leveling, 20 hours a week). Sounds about right, tbh.
---
Troll mage and warrior are probably going to be rare.
---
You have to remember subs like this are biased towards more min/maxing than what most players will be. The least played will not be the worst combinations, it will be the ugliest. In general I don't think a lot like the looks of trolls and especially not with something like mage (kind of conflict with the general theme of trolls in most peoples eyes).
---
What is up with all the fucking gatekeeping? You do realise that the 'bandwagoners'/primary classic crowd who have migrated from retail have done so primarily because they're sick of Blizzard and the direction that the game has taken, right? Those people who will mindlessly defend Blizzard will stick to retail.
---
Your opinion, as a private server player, is valuable - but it does not trump every other opinion. Not everyone is explicitly for or against layering. Not every private server player is against it, and not every 'bandwagoner' is for it.
---
Problem is not every bottleneck is a mob spawn, for example to get one of the Deadmines quests you need to talk to a NPC that only interacts with one player at a time. You would never get that quest done for the first few weeks of launch. Also crafting would be a mess to level up since there would barely be any nodes to collect, can't level engineering or alchemy if you ain't got no nodes. Prices would be sky high even for copper ore.
---
wtf is this shit?? First people are getting arena chests with layering swaps and now Xrealm? GG blizz lol.
---
ONLY BETA
---
Why would there be 10 layers ? If a layer can hold up to 2-3k ppl, you might have 2-3 eastern layers and 1 kalimdor layer at start. The zones can be packed, just like in private servers and they can add some faster spawn times. 
---
Or just leave the spawn timers what they used tobe, because ppl wanted a #nochanges launch. Camping one spot for 2 hours, not getting a tag. 
---
Almost all complaints are based on full on assumptions by players, when theres LOADS of options that they might do. But as per usual, ppl complaint about EVERY ONE OF THEM in advance, one by one.
---
And nobody has a perfect solution that others didnt complain about. gg this fucking "community". As retarded as retail.
---
Making eye another post on this isn’t going to change anything-change my mind.
---
I'm almost certain that the only discounts are at Honored and r3 pvp, both 10%.
---
According to bliz, wall hopping has been fixed and removed.
---
Probably a bug. It’s not like blizzard thinks they can get away with putting cross realm stuff in classic lol.
---
gratz Bird
---
No, the complain is that the economy is fucked up.
---
And it's fucked up EITHER by abundance or by scarcity.
---
The children in this thread... Guys. It's the beta. This is exactly what the beta is for. Finding unintended things in the game and finding bugs. This is SUPPOSED to happen.
---
I happened to randomly team up for 2v2 arenas back in tbc. We started having a chat a few round. Both same country, same city within 5 minutes walking. I even knew who he was. But i disliked the guy irl so after he went offline i put him on ignore list lol. But still, out of all realms and all players on the high pop server i get teamed up with someone in the same block.  Never talked to the guy ever since lol
---
cringy af
---
They should have at least one oce server.
---
There will be way more than 5 druids mate... I've rolled PServers before, many people still choose druid despite knowing all the facts about being suboptimal and sometimes useless. They get it, they still roll it.
---
That's like saying a cruise ship no different than a small personal fishing boat just because they both move and float on the water. You sound like a fucking moron, give it a rest.
---
I did all of that
---
Well, "is capital punishment a Bad Thing?" and even "is layering in Classic WoW a Bad Thing?" are essentially matters of opinion, while "is the earth flat?" concerns provable facts.
---
OMG Grab the pitchforks!

---
Weird bug since thats a completely new message, right? I have never seen this message in retail.
---
This is untrue, retail phasing doesn't exist in capital cities.
---
You couldn't be more wrong, it's laughable.  
---
There is a big difference from accepting an inferior product on release, and throwing a hissy fit on the beta when 95% of the beta has been relatively good.
---
Just merge servers over time. If they explain why, most people wouldn't care. It's not like their character gets thrown out the window. At worst they pick a new name. Or give free realm changes before merging. I know they dislike merging because it looks like the game is dieing but let's be real, nobody really cares
---
Really isn't, you talk about people who expect on duty calls for you to wake up at night to take your shift to protect stuff, and it is cross faction.
---
Week 2 every hardcore guild will clear mc. Lots are trying to work out if they can pull it off in week 1.
---
&gt;All the people who lost their name in the merge can just deal with making a new name. Problem solved.
---
Are you out of your mind? A forced namechange to possibly hundreds of people just to prevent some people exploiting the system? Plus you'll be competing for 20 mobs against &gt;500 people in Elwynn and Durotar on launch day.
---
There are way better solutions to this problem, amongst others:
---
* Limiting layer switching to rested zones
---
* Having combat, looting, mining, herbing, skinning, fishing, etc. lock you to your layer for 5-15 minutes
---
   * In addition: to further prevent the farming of rares/gurubashi, they could have a seperate lockout that prevents you from seeing the mob until it respawns on the layer that you killed it on.
---
* Limit layers to starting zones
---
* Limit layers to level 20

&gt;Is she engaging and what is her difficulty level in raids?  Does she share loot with mage warlock?
---
Priests are the most desirable raid healers behind or on par with Paladins. If you're a dwarf priest you basically get a free ticket in (because of their priest racial [Fear Ward](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=6346/fear-ward)). I couldn't tell you how difficult Priest healing is but healing in general isn't very hard, it's mostly a matter of casting the right rank of a spell to conserve mana.
---
You will not be sharing raid gear with dps classes.
---
&gt; If I'm worried about competeing for gear should I be worried about going  pally?   How big of an issue is gearing in raids as a popular class in  classic?    Is pally gameplay fun?  Or is the buffing she has to do  obnoxious? 
---
[Greater Blessings](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=25898/greater-blessing-of-kings) made this much easier than before when you had to cast the regular ones every 5 minutes but it's still something you'll have to keep up with. As for healing you basically play whack-a-mole with your raid UI — you watch for dropping health bars and Flash of Light on them.
---
&gt; For dps I do not want to use my healing class at all, I do not enjoy  respecing.   But I really want a ranged class.  I played legions bm  Hunter and enjoyed the freedom of movement and his simple but effective  gameplay.  Is anything like that in classic? 
---
Hunters in Classic have a dead-zone to contend with. You can not fire within 8 yards and cannot melee outside 5. You will also have to worry about carrying ammo, feeding and training your pet. Those details aside hunters are still very mobile, independent, and great solo levelers/farmers. However in raids they have one of the most complex rotations and you will have to be very knowledgeable and able to execute well to be worthwhile. Most raids will not take more than a few hunters as their DPS drops off in later stages.
---
&gt; If I played melee i honestly couldn't pick between rogue or warrior.   Which do you think would be better for someone who likes big dps? 
---
Fury warriors are always in demand as unlike hunters they scale extremely well. Rogues also have great DPS though. If all you're interested in is DPS you ought to go rogue as warriors are often expected to tank dungeons or off-tank raids. Warriors also have the worst leveling experience. It is very slow and very expensive. Rogue's experience is marginally better.
---
Lets say a week of layers. Most HC ppl are near or at L60. Loads are in the 20-40 range. Does it really make in difference in the whole economy, for the next 2 years ? Not really. Are people going to complain either way, ofc.
---
The damned March 4th!
---
Wait, I was under the impression you were supposed to be stuck to a layer until you switch continents.
---
This is just phasing/sharding/bullshit.
---
Were you born an asshole or do you work at it?
---
TBC noob here. When vendoring trash items I thought you had to drag them to the buyback tab of the vendor for some reason. This tab gets full, so I would log out/in to clear the tab so I could vendor the rest.
---
Also I didn't know there was an autorun feature until level 30 something when I was grouped with someone and they were magically typing in chat while running. That was A LOT of holding down the W key.
---
It was uploaded to Gummy’s channel, so it’s only right to assume the scumbag liar himself is one of the Oogas. Shame.
---
It looks like they’re testing the water for implementing the shop in Classic rather than having anything else meaningful come from the survey. 
---
This is still the same Blizzard we’ve known for the last 10 years.
---
There is probably a similar message for entering current tier mythic raids since that’s the only thing that’s restricted from doing cross realm
---
The only thing I came up with is blocking you from interacting with the same object again after jumping a layer.
---
Warlocks were out fire dpsing fire mages of course you were loving it. Meanwhile our dps and survivability were both low together.
---
ITT: People who don't understand that without layering the game would be an awful place until the server populations die down which might take months. Exploiting like this is BS and they will have to come up with a solution to it, but to remove layering completely would absolutely doom Classic from the start. Someone in here suggested a debuff after moving to another layer where you can't loot certain things which sounded plausible, but they'd have to implement something fairly soon and have people test it. I think before everyone here starts a riot and makes 328745892734982734283 posts about layering we should just wait and see what's up and how they handle it.
---
BFA obviously.
---
Nobody that has played BFA is complaining about the art. The art team is fucking killing it as per the usual. It's the gameplay that sucks.
---
I think the people so strict against layering or sharing are the people who never had a character on a dead server... A dead server is way worse then any abuse from layering... Merging server is also worse as the community is still not there and you essential start from a new building guilds and friendship
---
Layering could completely ruin the opening of the AQ gates. However, it could also completely save it (if you're lucky enough to be in the main layer that is actually opening it). I was there for the opening of the AQ gates and granted I had a poor computer, but it was a complete slideshow/random logouts and freezes. Regardless, one of the most epic experiences I've ever had in a game.
---
bUt iT Is SpElLeD dIfFeReNTlY tHaN ShArTiNg.
---
Just enough time to get a massive advantage and head start before it's over.
---
LETS BURN THIS FUCKER DOWN!!
---
Layer changing in capital cities only. What's the problem?
---
It should not even be an issue, Blizzard should of seen this exploit coming so yes it needs a very fast fix or a **major** backlash is well deserved.
---
Thanks for the answer. I am definitely going to spend a lot of time on a proper structure for the talents then, I'll keep your answer in mind once I get started. Thank you!
---
But with literally NO other heir, a bastard child is still the rightful heir.
---
... and the addition of honor. Without BGs. Blizz aren't going to pull the trigger on large scale world PVP while most of the population is still leveling up. The "we did everything as fast as possible and now have nothing to do" crowd are one of the key offenders in WoW's decline, prepare for this sub/classic forums to be a complete whiner's paradise around November time.
---
It is a sad reality that Vanilla and Classic are always going to be different, unless you believe that Classic will gain players throughout its lifecycle like Vanilla did. There is no easy answer, do you have swathes of dead servers 2-3 months after launch after tourists leave or do you have layering.
---
I'd go with dead servers that get merged (this will draw QQs as well though as server community will get diluted) but I get layering reasoning.
---
Going to be rolling a DPS Shaman, either an Orc or Tauren and I plan on doing tailoring and herbalism (for that sweet gold and bags). I’m a relatively casual player who started WoW in Cataclysm and I plan on doing pvp, preferably world pvp but I’ll definitely be doing dungeons as well. Anyone know if anything I said won’t be a good fit?
---
F streamers
---
Hooray for crz / sharding / layering / whatever they want to call it next. It's bad in every incarnation. Please just stop it.
---
See I'd like it if they added new zones in Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms.
---
Same lol such babyrage modders in asmon strim
---
It's okay it will be finished by its re release date of August 2020
---
Wait, sorry, they have to unbreak a 15 year old game they already released, in just 2 months.
---
Lol, yeah autorun will come in handy with those long ass corpse runs
---
Ok. This is amazing. I don't know who is doing this but, we need more.
---
And OP I hope you are doing that professionally for some kind of big ass company and making a shit ton of money. Because that's what you deserve. Wish I knew where to begin to have such skills.
---
Fair play
---
You'll be fine tanking 5 man's. Honestly think there's a warrior master race out there who think they are the only ones who can tank. I'm gonna roll a holy/prot spec for levelling so I can heal or tank dungeons whenever. It may not be optimal but who gives a fuck if its fun.
---
I would argue the correct question is "Do you care at all about the journey or would you rather pay to skip it to go to endgame content immediatly?"
---
With some preparations my lvl 1 was able to make it all the way to Booty Bay without dying, although that was not right after launch (you need some things that would not be available in week 1)
---
Hypothetically, layering will only be there for a couple of weeks. So the problem SHOULD be minimal - but at the end of the day, whatever resource you want in the open world will have its availability multiplied by the number of layers that exist at a given point in time - and players will find a way to obtain the resources they need.
---
If only they would let us play the refference client they have running...
---
Asmongold is 2nd best streamer after little payo ofc. POGGERS IN THE CHATTUH
---
An example from a Beta test, or not? 
---
I only played during the Stresstest, a short time before the servers went offline.
---
We got multiple messages from Blizzard staff, that they are experimenting with the layering technology, because... well it is a Beta after all.
---
But even then people complained as if they never got a message about that.
---
Till Blizzard proves otherwise, I give them the benefit of the doubt, that they use the BETA to test this stuff, instead of the release version.
---
People don't want layering or whatever they want to call it. They want a server full of the same people all the time. This is basically watered down crz with a different name.
---
The calculator seems really off. When you say you will play 168 hours per week (24 hours per day multiplied by 7) and you say you'll be a hunter with joana speed, it still calculates 5 days, which is above joana's record (although not much). But the fact that it's above, probably means the longer you will take, the more off the average is from the actual amount it will take you to ding 60.
---
&gt; dropout rate will be 50-60% in 3 months, like it was for almost every single MMO in history.
---
Except for WoW.
---
I understand that, but it’s only for a few weeks. I know those community needs but I’m happy to accept it for a while until the community active zones calm down slightly. 
---
If it was a permanent thing I’d be on your side. While I’m not happy about it, I do understand it.
---
If there was no layering, on launch people would be MAD as hell because newbies would hate Westfall and quit. So I think on balance it’s beneficial for the overall community in the long run.
---
They may be afraid too many people would get burnt out or just realize they fucked the pooch on this
---
Theorycrafting scenarios is very different than seeing it live. I would argue that it definitely needed to be seen
---
I understand exactly how it works, I just didn't want to bloat my OP to the point where it gets TL;DR replies only.    
---
We know that layering is a way to have mega-servers (to avoid bad optics from potentially have to server merge down the road if numbers drop a lot - I don't think they will)  
---
We know that layer is supposed to be sharding v2 with the main difference being that it is not cross-realm shards based around map cells (which makes you phase in and out crossing zone borders randomly with "strangers" from your entire server cluster)  
---
Layering is instead linking v1.0 shards together in a "horizontal" layer (hence the name) that is continent-based and only phases you in with people from your own mega-server (only difference between mega-server and server cluster at this point is the first has one name pool, other than that, it's semantics)  
---
The goal is to have the game as true to its original form (designed around the technical constraints of the period but with gameplay to fit) so layers are set to cap at ~3k population.
---
Since you seem to know all about it, how about you help the interested public by answering some simple questions ;)  
---
- How does the login server decide which layer you are put on when you first log on?
---
- How does the game decide when you move from one layer to the other within a session (other than the already known mechanic of getting invited to a group by a person in another layer)
---
- If a layer has 3000 people, what happens to the 3001 login, the 3002? Do they start shunting people into layers at 1500 like shuffling a deck of cards?
---
- Do you randomly get switched layer in prime time when your server pop spikes?
---
- Can you login into an "overflow layer" that has 400 people? (ie "ded serber mode enable?")
---
- Is AH/trade/mail/general channel systems layer specific or mega-server bound? How does that effect the economy?
---
- How do you reconcile [ ]2006 blizzlike pop and [ ]only 1 kazzak up per mega-server if your mega-server doesn't magically settle down to 3k prime time concurrency by phase-2?
---
What do you call these if not phasing?

Oh yeah, totally. This will definitely show us where Classic is heading. Ya know, with how the feature is being removed after a handful of weeks at the latest.
---
I doubt most people will have made it to STV before the feature is removed in a live environment...
---
Since it doesn't have reinforcements and Alliance has that damn bridge I believe you will have really long AV's.
---
It was after he went live yesterday after the AV server was announced. If you're one of his spergs just go watch one of these spammy asmong reacts videos.
---
But isn't layering there because there is more than normal amount of players on the server?
---
As I understand it, a server with three times the normal player count, will have three layers.
---
Which mean one player could theoretically get three times normal amount of herbs, but there is still three times player count to compete and buy them?
---
Which should end with the same result as no layering with more servers.
---
Ir am I missing something?
---
I was never an owl fan I do recall however running up to Darkshore to get a ghost sabre at... I cant remember what level I was but I died a lot. :) 
---
As a matter of fact... I am fairly sure my hunter-alt will be doing that this time around too. The translucent quality made it my favourite pet. It was my constant companion all the way to 60.
---
You bet no lifer guilds like Method will grind the living fuck out of all layers before they get turned off and sit on a giant pile of pots and flasks for the rest of the game.
---
Instanced copies of entire continents on a server. So basically parallel universes that are continent wide. You could be logged on with your friend in the same spot and not see eachother because you're on different layers. Think about when you try to meet someome at the summoning stone in retail but one of you is in warmode.
---
The classic one obviously only looks like that because of time constraints. Making super customized models for all the notable characters wasn't a top priority.
---
I would guess that's why all the high elves look a bit daft, they made custom models for them but it's such a small part of the game so they likely couldn't justify making them as detailed and well crafted as the playable races. As a result the high elves just end up looking like [albino down syndrome night elves](http://i.imgur.com/mI0epni.png).
---
And pservers will somehow be better than classic? I don't understand where you are going with that. I guess it's better to play pservers for free but I don't see how they are preferable over classic servers.
---
Druids are fine (great) pvp healers and surviving the odds and being super slippery is kind of their thing in pvp. In particular as a flag carrior in warsong gulch. 
---
Druids are pretty solid healers in raids but notably kind of "sort of worst priests". The don't really have any mana issues as far as healing goes. You need atleast 1 to 2 druids for buffs though and it's pretty easy to get tier gear as a druid. 
---
Moonkin is actually a meme. Some people bring them because they need warm bodies and the flex healing can be nice but they are subpar range dps
---
I am not sure why you resort to such ridiculous terms for plain logic?
---
When sharding was announced at Blizzcon, people on this very subreddit hated that idea and the vast majority spoke against it. Very few people argued that it was the best solution to avoid insane queues.
---
Months passed and layering was suggested as the alternative. Mind you, meanwhile, we had 50k additional subscribers to this subreddit and suddenly the overall attitude was that layering was healthy for the game to avoid some servers being forgotten and other servers being overcrowded.
---
That is a clear example of how retail/bandwagoners (who only came here because of the attention it has drawn from streamers) swayed the general opinion on this matter. It has nothing to do with "gatekeeping".
---
This is utterly horrible. There's no way this can be in the game.
---
I imagine it's the same as Warmode.
---
Nobody questions the premise apparently but where is the data on early attrition in legacy MMO servers?
---
Legitimately asking, I absolutely can't find anything on that topic let alone how it compares to normal MMO early dropoff.
---
I think of it this way, the higher gear level you reach the less you depend on fear since you can kill people inside a deathcoil. And alliance warlocks geared easier due to there being less warlocks so theres that lol. Check this human lock kicking ass out [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRS8dRDW7wg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRS8dRDW7wg) you see it isnt that bad
---
Salty because you dont have the beta?
---
This is beyond outrageous, its obvious they are checking how far they can push with this sharding in disguise before causing a backlash.
---
They are both ships.
---
Well, with layers the problem would be smaller? I am for layers in starting zones when there is a ridiculously high amount of new players
---
Without layering - server dies at certain amount of players / or have huge lag on every action
---
With layering - new layer at certain amount of players. Queues much shorter and in game you have no lag at all.
---
And without layers it would be competing against 1k+ people for quests, because servers can handle now more people that in vanilla (and that thanks to phasing and layering).
---
Stance dancing for overpower *may* still be worth it in certain situations as arms.
---
Sometimes you are fighting somthing higher level than you or something that blocks often. Many times in these cases revenge is going to get dodged blocked or parried. 
---
Especially as arms you have tactical mastery so you won't get screwed on rage for stance dancing, and if you have improved overpower, there's certainly reasons to try and land that crit overpower if you just need to make sure you get a hit off on that mob.
---
YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! WIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIN!
---
A character only has to be level 35 to reach 300/300 of a profession. You can level an alt to 35 and use it to craft your potions.
---
I'm going to level my main with mining/herbalism. Once I hit 60 I'll drop mining for Engineering and use the ores I stored up to level it. Then I'll level an alt to 35 and send it all my herbs to level it's alchemy.
---
I'll probably also level tailoring on the alt with all the cloth I farmed on my main. This will give me access to both Transmute Arcanite (Alchemy) and Transmute Mooncloth (Tailoring) on the same character. That's some easy, free money every few days. Sure it takes some initial time investment, leveling the alt and it's professions. But after that's done it's just free payout.
---
And for engineering materials to craft more grenades/mines, I can just buy those off the AH with the money I make from herb/alch.
---
you don't need defensive stats to tank dungeons anyway.
---
You can get that via engineering gadget, if you really want to optimize for that.
---
You're welcome.
---
Did this survey last night as I was headed to bed. Probably took about 15-20 minutes or so to complete. Felt like there were a good 100 questions or so.
---
It will be absolutely mandatory for at least 2 weeks, maybe up to a month. Not everyone is taking off work to tryhard grind to 60. Im just not sure why areas like the arena have different layers
---
&gt;I really want to focus on mobility and surviving absurd odds, so it sounds like Druid is my kind of thing.
---
For PvP they have a lot of capability to outplay, but you really need to understand that it requires skills. They have potential, but only if you can outplay people, the class won't carry you. If you are up for the challenge, druid will fit.
---
&gt; I see everyone glossing over Balance - is it really that bad?  
---
&gt;I would also like to heal or rdps in raids, but again it seems like Druid has mana issues here?
---
In raids, yes. Their dps is quite low, so you will most likely be stuck as healer, but it should not be too hard to find a raid spot as resto. Sure you are not the best healer, but good enough and bring a few neat tricks like battle res.
---
For PvP balance / resto hybrid specs are actually one of the go to, so you could do resto for raids and balance / resto for PvP, this seems to somewhat allow you to do what you want.
---
&gt;Is there any other class I should be considering?
---
Ele shaman might be fun for you. The thing about balance druid in PvP is, while they are viable, they don't really play that much like balance. You will still use forms a lot and rely on your dots to slowly kill the enemies with only a few wrath or even more rare a starfire. You spend a lot of time in travel form kiting while reju heals you or bear form to soak damage while your DoT deals damage. Some variations of builds will also use cat form for some extra dps without using mana.
---
This is where ele shaman comes in, they will also tap into resto so you get that whole nature off healing thing in PvP; but instead of the kind of "cheesy" playstyle of bala you will be blasting your enemies with your actual spells. Lightning Bolt &gt; Chain Lightning &gt; Earth Shock is amazing burst and having mail armor, Frost Shock and Ghost Wolf allows you to play more as the spec was "meant to", compared to bala druid where you kind of have to work around the spec it self to make it work.
---
Sounds like private server goggles, I certainly don’t have fond memories of how long quests could take on Illidan in 2004.
---
Yeah, I still have a few rough ones. I need to learn more intracacies of that panning method.
---
Thank you a lot for that suggestion!
---
They have grouped with someone who does, but I do not think they do.
---
Asmongold is autistic and an asshole. Swifty is better

---
Well, they're technically native to Draenor... Just some excerpts from Warcraft history..
---
The Dragonqueen and her vengeful kin incinerated the greater bulk of the Dragonmaw clan before Alliance troops rounded up the remaining survivors and threw them into internment camps, with the exception of a few clan members that managed to flee into the Twilight Highlands. The defeat effectively put an end to the last bastion of orcish power in the world and signaled the end of the Horde and the end of the orcs' furious bloodlust.[17][18][20] Some of the interned Dragonmaw orcs later rejoined the Horde after being freed from the internment camps by Thrall.[21]
---
So really, the zone would fit better with sporadic survivors of Dragonmaw and a slightly larger number of Wildhammers. Most of the remaining Dragonmaw are in the hills of the Wetlands with those catapults.
---
Chance and Soni already got it, so this would be 3rd
---
Classic will be hyped beyond belief at launch and every man and their dog will try it out. The population will track inversely to Vanilla (likely going up and down as content cycles release), and will decline in the first 3-6 months not rise dramatically. 
---
For example on Nostalrius there were 800,000 accounts and 150,000 active by the shutdown (19%). This is on a private server with a far higher degree of difficulty of accessing meaning those who went out of their way to create an account are much more likely to be Vanilla aficionados. 
---
There will be tourists from retail WoW and other Blizzard franchises, a good % will love the game and stick but many will not. This will drop populations and lead to server merges not new servers.
---
Huge Hype about Classic makes that many retail player will check classic out. Because they get it for free. Many of those players will leave again after killing pigs for 2 hours for 1 quest. Evidence? You know good and well there is no evidence for something in the future. I would bet there will be no fresh servers, they will just but another layer OMEGALUL
---
Update: I have extended the sheet to cover rets, prot paladins, enchancement shamans and moonkins.   
---
I have been giving it some thought and I know that the specs may not considered to be viable in terms of outputting high enough DPS or TPS. But to be fair, to be able to clear the game you don't have to min/max. This sheet is meant to be used by the community and not only the top tier raiding players.  
---
Full credit to Reddit user ghettojesusxx for compiling the ret column. My heart couldn't bare to add rets and not the rest which is why I've compsed the enhancement, moonkin and prot paladins myself. I have no experience playing either of the specs, so please help me out if you think they look totally off!
---
Monkeynews was exploiting layering weeks ago to farm the same ore node multiple times across layers
---
Phasing is when two different players see two different versions of the same zone based on their progression through that zone, it was first introduced in Icecrown back in WotLK. It has nothing to do with managing population, it's a story telling tool and will never be used in Classic since the zones don't have stories that work that way.
---
Female tauren and ork do that as well. Female undead do a flip instead I think.
---
Is this a flex? I can't tell anymore, it's all a blur.
---
I'd get to the bottom of how you're accidentally taking screenshots and fix that
---
I liked how he got mad that they should make a stteamsniping blakclist, and mcconnel just sayd well then dont fucking stream. Still no idea why hes videos keep popping up on my youtube.
---
"All players in the party must be from the same realm to enter Kalimdor"
---
What is this?
---
Did they give a reason why they can't just shard starting zones and not use world-wide layering on launch? Presumably, sharding in starting zones would be less abusable than layering in higher level zones.
---
Viewercount is the only "countable" value tho. How else would you define good or bad? He obv. does a lot of things most people like. Can't beat pepejam ofc.
---
Oh yeah, that’s what everyone wants to see when they go to Stormwind and Org. Players vanishing!
---
Nothing says “immersion” like vanishing players in major cities!
---
please report this as bug, and please all upvote this.
---
Stuff like this completely takes you out of the experience. When I play BFA and experience layering/sharding I just feel "meh" and just dont care. Classic was NOT LIKE THAT! NO CHANGES
---
Oh my God I didn't know he played Classic
---
If you're asking for someone to accompany you regularly you should probably also state what your region is as well as your intended server type, otherwise people will be unable to respond accurately.
---
It is almost certainly slower than regular questing even if you have a decent group that is relatively fast at clearing. It will have you with less downtime though if done efficiently and also probably better geared by the time you hit 60 too.
---
Or maybe, just maybe, people are worried about the issues that come up from giant surges and droughts in server populations. There have been times where queues have been over 24 hours long for over a week (WoD launch) which have prevented people from even being able to play the game for over a week and a long history of dying realms once the initial surge goes away. Layering solves both of these issues which have plagued WoW for so long. Unless you want such an authentic experience that you want [congestion hellhole part of Classic](https://www.engadget.com/2013/09/13/wow-archivist-a-rolled-back-history-of-realms/) to come back too.
---
i like v8
---
I actually do prefer the original. Nothing wrong with the modern one either as that's also a great design, but I think there's something about the simplicity of the design combined with the dark attire that gains my preference.
---
They can still last super long if Horde decides to wipe alliance at galv and back cap. It only takes a team of like 10 people to pull it off too
---
I dont understand where redditors like yourself are getting your info, the best predictions put phase 1 at easily 4 months + with phase 2 being incredibly short due to the tolerance for hk system with no bgs being about less then 4 weeks. So imagine phase 1 being as short as your pretending and phase 2 being short phase 3 comes out in what 4 ? Months I just dont get it. Layering needs to work and work with out exploits as it will almost certainly be the longest phase of classic wow. (Obviously not counting post nax nothingness) F R E S H
---
Oh my
---
How would that work with resplendent rates differing by server? What tethers nodes with diff spawn rates?
---
Anyways That still allows a guild to team farm stuff
---
Yes a Night Elf leading a Horde undead faction. seems legit.
---
Did you watch the video? Pservers don’t have this problem, making them infinitely better already. This phasing exploit isn’t going to stop at Arena chests, its going to be used to avoid PvP, farm rare herbs (Ghost Mushroom / Blotus) and rare spawns.
---
Like I said my enjoyment comes from playing with a functional economy. I literally quit WoW at one point because the AH was near completely broken.
---
If there was one thing I hated about phasing / sharding in retail - it was the abuse of switching between shards. If Classic has this problem, I legit do not want to be a part of it. Which is awfully sad because i’ve been an advocate for Classic longer then a lot of people here have been playing WoW.
---
Thanks!  Not recruiting right now just seeking feedback.  Edited post to clarify.
---
Generally you want engineering for PvP but otherwise you're good to go — as long as DPS = Elemental. Enhancement isn't very good in classic, you'll just get kited around a lot or denied windfury procs by the RNG gods.
---
You obviously know nothing about the end game economy
---
Well little Timmy sometimes you can read the comments for context.
---
Better in dungeons/while questing. Go to an area in the city. no worse than someone logging on or off. That's not really too bad.
---
I agree, you then can't argue with the evidence given.
---
Limiting layer to level 20 would ruin anybody’s leveling experience post 20. As would limiting to starting zones. And you haven’t thought about all of the negative repercussions to layer collapsing if you have 3-10 layers on your server
---
you are correct, it is 10% at honored, with your native faction, and when R3, you get another 10%.
---
Did you mix up the classes? Any remotely competent paladin will cleanse Viper Sting making it useless.
---
Shamans are also a bit annoying, though - mostly due to Frost Shock.
---
Both of these arent in in P1 if Blizzard follows what Ion said in his tweet. But they could be, who knows. Pretty much a non issue, you just take them if they are available or you roll on HoJ when no one needs it.
---
Wait... weren't you watching him if you know that information?
---
Dealt with this on everquest tlp servers.  You just move to a safe corner before pick hopping.  Works well there and it is very transparent.  Most players clamor for new picks to open up good camps when entering into zones.  Pick creation is automated based on the average amount of players in each pick.
---
no you are not missing something, you are entirely correct. But there is no arguing with these people they will moan cry and bitch about anything trying to make it into an issue. Basic logic is lost on them.
---
Oh now r/classicwow wants something to be done about layer hop abuse when a streamer does it. What a surprise.
---
Proudmoore?
---
If phase 1 is only two weeks classic will blow.
---
When this guy calls me a keyboard warrior using semantics when I very politely tried to educate him on his ignorance, I could give two shits about calling him a dicknose. So I guess....born an asshole
---
... Wow... I mean, these basic layers exploits have been reported for the entirety of the beta at this point and are still live. If you're not at the very least becoming anxious you have your head in the sand.
---
Majority of the players between these layers won’t make it to 60 / need the flasks from these mats. If Blizzard believes they will quit before P2 then they are just creating 3 times the herbs for the few players that do push through.
---
But the more layers there is, the harder it is to maintain monopoly. Maybe they succeed, but the fact is the logistics increase for each layer.
---
I subbed to play retail a little an you know the worst thing it? Every time I level I /yell 'ding!', as is tradition, and not a single 'congrats' or 'grats' or even a 'wd'.
---
It should be fast because of how easy it is to fix.
---
1 hour CD on picking up a new chest after doing a chest. Easy.
---
Just wait til its happening to you then remember yourself saying "he can't appreciate the fun" (of being ganked multiple times by rogues)
---
It's amazing how you assume the worst intent, typical tinfoil hat no doubt an Alexensual fanboy. Some people see layering as the best of a bad set of options (not me personally I think just merging servers when they die after 6 months) so stop assuming the worst and address people's actual arguments rather than figments of your imagination you toxic fuck.
---
I'd be very surprised and incredibly disappointed if we didn't get them.
---
In fact I probably wouldn't even bother playing if that turns out to be the case.
---
No Kael'thas.
---
It's not for phase 1. It is for just afew weeks of phase 1. Ion has been quoted saying as such.
---
Agree.  Ban the first guild that exploits for devilsaur leather, problem solved.
---
Warrior, just like you said already. It's nice to have a friend that can tank so you don't have to rely on 'random' players that much. Also you won't be raiding until 60, so you will need a tank for dungeons. You are basically a full dungeon team if you go warrior.
---
This. Keep fully layered starting zones, but anyone who leaves a zone beyond lvl20 is irreversibly put on the same big boy layer. Alternatively, this could also be tied to a player's level. 
---
It's either a consistent community or the ability to play with anyone. Both at once isn't possible.
---
And Trolls. Z H I T o o g a (male troll laugh)
---
&gt;On one hand I really like enhancement Shaman, running around slapping people up in PVP with wind fury on a 2 hander while throwing in frost shock mid fight.
---
I really love the idea of that as well, but remember that all the videos you see are cherry picked. More often than not you won't get that WF proc and in general I don't think they are that fun in PvP. It's a meme spec.
---
&gt;But they apparently level super slow, are weaker when leveling and have no heals.
---
People blow it way out about warrior being slow at leveling. It's not that bad, just don't be dumb and pull more than you can kill. So what if it takes a few days extra before you are 60? After that it can be years of playing, rather spend a tiny bit extra time initially. Also, I actually find warrior quite entertaining to level.
---
Shamans can be fun, just saying, if you never actually tried them they might fool you. If you had talked about ele I'd be more inclined to recommend shaman.
---
Well met!
---
Ok, now tell us dishonestly
---
I am quite alright waiting a week longer to play if they remove layering. Let the people that are going to play 24/7 get in and get out of the way first then it won't be bad.
---
To be fair, Humans are pretty stupid animals.
---
Ion is quoted saying it will only last afew weeks. About a month ago. Your info is wrong.
---
Abusing game mechanics will result in a ban and removal of gear/items obtained directly caused by this abuse... So no... They wouldn't... They have waaaay too much to lose
---
&gt; The thing is, they can’t change this about layering
---
Are you fucking retarded? Change it so you can only switch layers in rested areas and starting zones and put a 30 min CD on switching. Problem solved.
---
But wouldn't the level 60 to flask ratio, be around the same, if it was spread out over three servers, instead of one with layering
---
from a model perspective there is no question which one is better. But in Vanilla this was just another race leader in a faction of many, which I prefer over a crazy super hero villain lady
---
You can come up with 100+ solutions better then sharding/layering.
---
&gt;Did you mix up the classes? Any remotely competent paladin will cleanse Viper Sting making it useless.
---
No, that's the whole point. Viper sting costs less to cast than to dispel and if they're busy dispelling it they're not doing anything useful. Meanwhile hunters can readily sacrifice their GCD since most of their damage comes from auto attacks.
---
Even with layering you’re competing with 1000 people for a quest brother
---
The game plan is to have it active for as short a time as possible, there's a good chance that it will be turned off by the time most of these exploits become viable, if they are turned off by the time the tier one levelers hit stv then it's really not gonna be as big of a deal as people are making it
---
Just delete this please.
---
There is still nothing to fix. This is a feature, that was asked by the community, working as intended.
---
Imagine this scenario - you and your friend decide to play classicwow - make 2 fresh characters, both log on and you can't see each other. What now .. you gonna walk to orgrimmar as lvl1 to hop layers?
---
Warlocks can solo Scholo but it isn’t really the most efficient way to make gold. A fresh level 60 lock can do Princess and Tinkerer in Mara and maybe Rotgrip depending on spec/skill/luck. Once DM is released, locks can do lashers in DM:E as well as bosses in multiple wings by taking advantage of mob pathing in several locations.
---
I wouldn’t be against them giving the option to turn off xp gains like on retail to facilitate the 19, 29, etc...BG metas. But hard capping everyone below 60 is just asinine.
---
tank talents arent bad for leveling, especially the 1h bonus dmg is quite good.
---
Did I say you needed to walk on egg shells?  Just be prepared that if you act like a child people are going to treat you like a child.
---
That's not phasing. You're confusing your terminology here. Phasing refers to the persistent world changes that occur as a result of progressing certain quest storylines and was implemented in WotLK before CRZ existed. If you are standing in a town that got destroyed but your friend hasn't started that quest line then you would not see him there despite being on the same server because you were in another phase. If both of you walked like 10s into another area he would appear to pop back into your game. Classic won't have this because there are literally no quests in vanilla that use the technology the same way vehicles didn't exist in vanilla.
---
&gt;Does hunters lack of gear/scaling through AQ and Naxx gimp them in pvp through these tiers?
---
Not really. It is kind of funny, because hunters stay top notch in PvP despite their bad scaling. Their sustained DPS is bad, which is why they are not great DPS in PvE later on, but their Aimed Shot + Multi Shot burst is still super strong, which is what matters in PvP. They also have great utility like Viper Sting (amazing in BG's) and traps.
---
Overall, both are pretty fun in wPvP and BG's, so honestly I wouldn't worry about what is best. Both will perform well, so you are in the lucky situation where you can pick what you will find most fun and not have to think about being underpowered.
---
Yeah but if it's about an amount you don't say "good or bad" cause that's defining quality. Most-viewed, period.
---
The other aspect to server "settling" that often is overlooked and has nothing to do with the "tourist" leaving, is players logging on at different times and on different days. On day 1, hour 1, everyone will want to play, but after a couple weeks, players will normalize their play time, whether it's few hours after work/school everyday or just on certain days of the week. 
---
Hell, you can see this happening in beta already, the 1st few weeks were pack but there's not nearly as much going on anymore and not nearly as many logged in at the same time.
---
like a lot people, glad to help !
---
plenty to do before that, in a way its a relief that pvp is first in phase 2.
---

---
I was promised boobs and all I got was sweaty bald men. This is Classic.
---
I agree with all of these. I would add arenas. Arenas and resilience is the reason that PvP and PvE became divided in the game.  
---
Except for that I really like TBC. The Classes and the raids were good. The heroic dungeons had the perfect difficulty level for me.  
---
TBC talents/classes and the availability of hard five man content is what I would take from TBC if I could choose. But I can't choose so I would rather have the whole world in Classic than the end game in TBC.
---
&gt; You people need to stop freaking out about the azerite gear system, blizz will fix it in time for beta.
---
&gt;Blizz will fix it for launch.
---
&gt;Blizz will fix it for 8.1
---
&gt;Blizz will fix it for 8.1.5
---
You need to fucking neck yourself.
---
They should be removed from the beta then. I am not against streamers getting priority to the beta, but if they are not willing to test, then blizzard should invite the thousands of people who are willing to play and waiting for beta invites.
---
Do you hate breasts?
---
have you actually leveled up a warrior to 60 as prot?
---
"This is still the same Activision/ Blizzard we’ve known for the last 10 years."
---
Correct.  It is the single most obvious driving concept behind all of this, yet almost no one (&lt;5%) are able to see and/or accept it.
---
Haha boobs are in the middle of clip. But the other sexual action in wow are sausage parties haha
---
Is the name registration 15 days before lunch also small chance of getting?
---
Lol. The sheeply oppressed? We are not Hong Kongnese whos’ rights are being taken away by the Chinese government. It’s just a video game.
---
It's not testing because fuck streamers you know
---
Which  three T2 pieces are generally taken to buff chain heal?
---
Classic won't have sharding
---
Classic will have sharding but just in the starting zones on launch
---
Classic will have layering but only for approximately a few weeks
---
Classic will have layering only in "phase one"
---
Classic has functional layering and it is the solution.
---
Classic will have functional layering before the beta is over. 
---
Give an inch, take a mile. #nochanges and now we're defending an easily exploitable sharding esque system on steroids. Keep it classy classic WoW
---
Truthfully, if you level as a tank in dungeons it will take much longer to level unless you have a good guild/group. You will however, have the best gear available for your level so there’s that. It’s how I leveled and although it adds many hours to the grind I recommend it.
---
&gt;1.  
---
&gt;Content must be related to WoW: Classic
---
Are they recruiting for the Classic release? inv pls
---
Horde orc pets are stronger
---
Horde undead locks look more like warlocks and are fitting for RP
---
Alliance gain threat reduction from paladins
---
Gnomes gain 5% intellect, don't overestimate ittoo much tho, at naxx thats around 0.2-0,3% spell crit in the best gear and buffed.
---
I remember the first day I had vanilla I was playing my Troll Hunter in Durotar and a gray mail chest piece dropped. I was really excited and went to equip it but in red letters it said “Mail”. Not knowing this meant it was mail armor, I made another character and tried mailing it to him to see if he could wear it. Yeah.
---
Aw shit, here we go again.
---
And by then, she was nothing to me but MEMES.
---
Yeah I think it is the least bad situation, although it will still suck massively. What will be the worst is merging servers, but it has to happen really quickly (likely inside first 6 months) to prevent servers dying and creating a cycle of people falling out of the game. Community will just have to suck it up and rebuild realm communities with new players. 
---
I just pray I am on a populated server, it's despite my better judgement what makes me want to roll on a private server players server.
---
GAMERS RISE UP REEE
---
Thank you. So refreshing to hear someone else say this
---
Well, I did just fine and even have video proof.
---
And my main inspiration was always drakedog.
---
About clueless opponents, well, it was vanilla. Most people were terrible (most still are lol)
---
class quest will be locked, do you mean locked locked ? Or I'll just have to travel to my capital to get them ?
---
That's an entirely different technology--phasing, not sharding. Sharding and Wrathgate phases have as much in common as wrathgate phases and dungeon instances.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/shaman-sets
---
You mean, a podcast to compete with the other 426 podcasts about Classic, all discussing and repeating their talking points? Sure, it'll be hit, sign me the fuck up
---
^(lmao)
---
I would upvote this wholesome story but your karma is already sitting at 69.
---
What’s hard to understand about this game needing to be run on hardware servers?
---
New wow layering and sharding is OK because the world itself is uneventful. Here the world has much more depth and therefore rewards. 
---
Give us static servers then assign realms by regions. IE realms A-F are US-West...etc. 
---
Not every deployment of servers needs to be a kubernetes and serverless infrastructure...
---
You don't know how widely known DRACULA is? Of course it's a reference lol
---
It’s not just that it looks like the game is dying, it’s that it destroys server identity
---
It's just a beta, they'll fix it!
---
The game just launched, they'll fix it!
---
It's only 1.1, they'll fix it next patch!
---
It's not a "bug" its a feature that has been here since the beta!
---
&gt; Lets say a week of layers.
---
citation needed. Cause according to blue posts layering will last through the phase1. Which can last MONTHS.
---
&gt; human stuff was kinda meh.
---
So it's true to original
---
Well it may suck, but complaining isn't gonna change anything, were gonna get it
---
You mean the end game where phasing will be disabled? Ah, that end game. What an issue.
---
What blows my mind is that there are high elves and high elf models in the game in vanilla but blizzard decided to make her a night elf. I got a kick out of it when I first saw her in WoW.
---
casuals will not bother with layerhopping.
---
saw a warlock pvp movie on [warcraftmovies.com](https://warcraftmovies.com). amazed by how the guy was easily winning 1vX, shielding himself, getting heal for his damage output. spent 4 weeks leveling a gome warlock in my school summer holidays, no questing just grinding mobs all day. I was level 46 or something doing the stairs event in that tanaris dungeon. another warlock was in that group. I asked him, when I finally get that ability to turn dark. he didnt understand, we exchanged ICQ numbers and I linked him the video.
---
"dude, thats a shadow priest", he said.
---
yup, and even tho people kept asking why not fury i actually enjoted it, you are first among the choices for dungeons of which there are plenty of early release and in world pve you have a reduced chance to recieve critical damage and your dps is more stable.
---
not ideal for pvp but well pvp is first phase 2 on classic and not many would do pvp when their kills dont benefit them and aint even counted ;)
---
In classic you'd never see them again, we are getting cr bgs , and 1.12 av
---
AFAIK right now, no. It's the same pool of people who're in beta.
---
Not even that. As you mentioned, enh is a meme spec. The videos you see of enh one shotting are cherry picked, basically sometimes you get lucky with a WF proc AND crit, but overall it is not a reliable class for PvP. Ele is actually the go to PvP spec, it has insane burst as well but unlike Enh you got it on demand. Being able to choose when it happens makes all the difference. Some people like it simply because you randomly sometimes just do insane instant damage, but due to the extreme RNG nature it is not that great.
---
The reason why Enh is used for leveling is because when leveling in vanilla you generally don't want to cast too many spells, as it just means you have to sit and drink, thus wasting time. Enh improves your melee damage so you might just cast a few spells and melee the enemy down.
---
For PvE resto is the go to. Neither of the DPS specs can compete much with other classes, but resto shamans are amazing healers especially due to Chain Heal (unlike later expansions it is rare to have AoE healing, and a spamable at that).
---
Gotcha
---
"It's not for Monday, it's for Monday between the hours of 8 and 9 am."
---
So, you mean it's for Monday.
---
I swear I read somewhere ages ago wall jumping was going to be a thing. I miss that !
---
Did it yesterday. Killed 18 with no drop and abandoned the quest.
---
I can tell you didn't bother to watch any of the clips from the beta where the exact thing that supposedly layering is there to prevent is happening (things "phasing" in and out of existence randomly, even as you are fighting them)  
---
I know phasing was introduced for storytelling purposes and initially sold as such but that's not where we are now.  
---
Exactly how we are sold layering as temporary but it's not where we're going to be few months in.  
---
Disappearing mining nodes or hoping shards to get tlpd is not a storytelling device.
---
n o H a i r
---
I prefer the original. I like it better when faction leaders look more like the players. Bite me.
---
I can image many of the streamers and current beta people comparing AV to like mop or cats version instead of the proper vanilla and just going to retail
---
Voluntary transfers won't cover it. Merges will be required.
---
Yeah when the faction leaders race is that of the opposite faction is much better 🤣
---
Guess why they don't want to invest in 3x the amount of servers over layering in the short-term? BECAUSE it's not predictable. But saying it's plausible that they won't turn off layering is ridiculous. They'll turn it off and we'll have to deal with whatever consequence might happen. I don't see the point in arguing about a scenario Blizzard has promised won't happen, actually so incredibly pointless.
---
Yeah I want to see what Ion has to say about it.
---
I remember him saying something around the lines of understanding the importance of limited resources, and how there should be only one lord kazzak per server etc...
---
This right now is an example of limited resource not being that limited. Okay, AGM won't make or break a fight at level 60, but still, it's missing the point...
---
I don't really trust blizzard with much anymore but I am holding on, they are going to do what benefits them in the end.
---
This sharing and layering thing definitely isn't classic, it's just the start of a snowball, especially when it's core like this.
---
Yes, they could turn it off completely in a few months and that would be great but what's stopping them from just altering it once that few months has passed and people are invested into it again.
---
Complaining can change it. Complaining litterelly lost blizzard billions in stock and moved all their programmers to Diablo 4 so I don't really get what you are saying. But even if I give you that they won't change it. I'm going to complain about shitty things regardless. I don't just bend over and let people fuck me.
---
You're fooling yourself if you think it's going away
---
Yeah I agree. Blizzard surely has more data on that than me, and it certainly seems like common sense that a lot of players will return to check it out but fail to invest enough time to get to 60. How many? Who knows.
---
Spongebob memes are super helpful here bro, keep it up.
---
How do they spell this out? Like n o H a i r, what are the lettercombinations?
---
&gt;So I guess....born an asshole
---
I suspected as much
---
Blizzard doesnt have the technology.
---
And because of the beta Blizzard can make adjustments and limitations to layering... Think a bit farther than your immediate outrage please.
---
And we've got some rich history of them doing exactly that and it resulting in a shit storm on live.
---
&gt;could give two shits
---
Why could you give two shits? Do you mean you couldn't give two shits?
---
When people are arguing the wow vanilla nostalgia filter, they will link this comment.
---
She looks like horseshit in vanilla.
---
Law of large numbers and the fact that the way people are distributed across the world isn’t totally random. 
---
This is bound to happen to someone and you just happen to be them. 
---
I think it would be smart for blizzard to implement things like you suggest but they’ve made no mention of this kind of philosophy and it wouldn’t be that easy to implement in a way that you have enough people to play with.
---
Let me stick to EPvP then pls, I have a massive dong to wrestle
---
prices are based on K3 prices so its not really accurate for classic, should have used early release prices
---
We posted pretty similar posts within three minutes of each other.... were brothers
---
Bless the Oogas, trolls ftw.
---
Yeah.. another tinfoil hat that is working off of the assumption Blizzard won't do what they promised. Great argument. 9/11 was an inside job btw.
---
Honestly? the best solution would be making it impossible to move between layers at all. Just like you are playing on another server, that will be merged in the future.
---
Maybe allow 1 "layer hop" per month at most, so you can play with your friends etc
---
if layering/sharding is close to BFA I wont renew my sub. It ruins the immersion completely.
---
Ok thanks, for a moment I thought I missed blizzard would remove leveling bg's completely, which would have been a no-go for me ;)
---
This brings me to the question why is everyone so against classic wow with bfa visuals? Surerly leaving the world as it is and bringing an overhauled graphics would not be that bad... or am I wrong?
---
You cant even type ooga gang in the chat since its filtered. I dont mind Asmon, he is sarcastic, he is keeping up a show and taking him seriously is stupid. But things like these just make him look like a crybaby. He still doesnt get that in this day in age, if you stream on a pvp server, well you gotta get used to stream snipe ganking. The arguement his stream is his job yeah - well there is a pve Server as well isnt that great? Or just take it like Staysafe etc and laugh about it instead of crying.
---
Exactly.
---
Nothing wrong with sausage.

I rolled ud mage coz I thought the warlock in the trailer was a mage with stone elemental
---
&gt; Guys. It's the beta.
---
Except layering will be there for phase 1, not just the beta.
---
No I just don’t really have a good gauge on how well known that quote is from Dracula, I only know it because I studied Dracula in school
---
Guess someone's getting an up vote then.
---
... I mean it's the beta so bugs and unintended things are supposed to happen so they can fix/change them. And no, layering will only be for the first few weeks of phase 1.
---
Lol this is gold
---
I don't like it, but I think it's the least bad option as a whole  as long as they keep their word.  For me personally I'll be playing regardless of what they do but for first time players I see layering as a better option than ques, server caps, and extreme mob scarcity with the need for server transfers down the line to normalize player counts
---
Well everyone is willing to play ofcourse, but not 3 days straight av only I guess. Why should they be removed from the beta if they don't want to test 8h av a day? There are a lot of ppl who don't like pvp maybe or don't like AV, they're not gonna play it. Should they be removed too? Doesn't makes sense to me.
---
If you've been paying attention they've already gone back on their word. Continue slurping down their pr though
---
You do realise that is exactly what she is.....She is an undead nightelf that leads the forsaken. She was killed by Arthas.
---
And the solution could be as easy as having a select amount of layers to chose among, i e "Hellscream 1; Hellscream 2; Hellscream 3; Hellscream 4" and treat them as individual realms. Start with an amount of layers (I'd rather call them sub-servers) and show the indicators of low / medium / high / full population. This way we still get the full server support of layering but no exploit, and friends that can coordinate enough to chose the same realm can coordinate enough to chose the same layer. Start out with few layers and slowly increase their number if necessary.
---
If you want to further explain your observations on the server infra -- I'd love to hear.
---
I want server continuity to be as good as it can on launch. Sharding/Layering can damage the community and economy of a server. It needs to be handled well. If you want to talk about the specifics, I'm all ears.
---
&gt; People are the problem here, not the technology.
---
Yeah, but a good developed technology prevents people from abusing it. So you can say the tech is the problem.
---
I mean as i said it is viable for non raid content. It just isn't the best. Warrior or druid will outclass you any day post 5 man content. Plus many people aren't willing to bring a paladin tank.
---
or aoe farming spots, imagine being able to farm the same spot of easy mobs over and over without having to wait for respawns...
---
&gt; I can image many of the streamers and current beta people
---
Many of the streamers in the beta likely also played Vanilla but for every one of them there's HUNDREDS of people like me in the beta.  Been in since 2004 with tons of AV experience in Vanilla.  Stop assuming just because you're not in the beta that Blizzard only invited streamers and Legion babies.
---
&gt;comparing AV to like mop or cats version instead of the proper vanilla and just going to retail
---
Like it or not we're going to be getting something more akin to Cata or MOP and less like the original AV because by 1.12 in Vanilla the AV we knew and loved was mostly already gone.  The NPCs had been nerfed, reduced in number, and moved around.  The "rush" strategy of largely ignoring the enemy faction was entirely viable by this point.
---
Yeah after thinking I don't think they will do it and I agree it isn't necessarily targeting classic, I just think it is a pretty bad coincidence that this question game literally straight after classic questions.
---
Totem Weaving Enhance isn't a top tier spec at all, Ele/Resto is spec if you can't be bothered to switch back from PvP. Resto is the only spec you can play (obviously variations on talent points etc).
---
When were reinforcements added? I vaguely remember the change but can’t pinpoint when
---
The thing Is I guarantee we are going to have queues on release regardless of sharding. They might not be as bad as the original, but they will be there.
---
Layering should not be used at all. Ever.
---
&gt; This is a feature, that was asked by the community
---
lul wut
---
All I can do is assume only the streamers are there as they are the only voice...
---
Hey this is super cool, i have been looking and there are a lot of items with proc's all over vanilla, i am sure we can find more broken ones to play with. If you have more info please shoot it my way,
---
I agree with more servers but with a caveat. Pre plan merges and tie character names to a group of servers that are planned to be merged in the future. Duplicate name issue solved.
---
This might be stupid questuon but how did he know he was on a different shard?
---
(I didnt play much since TBC)
---
hahah
---
I'm just saying Core Leather is not a factor. There will be plenty in the guildbank and on the Auction house by the time you unlock those recipes.
---
But my main point is that even without all those stuff the Druid preraid FR gear is simply better than Warriors. The total mitigation from physical and total health will be higher than a Warrior at the FR cap of 315 against bosses.
---
And then we'll see players dissapearing in front of us, just like sharding
---
That solves THIS specific problem, but not others that can be exploited with layer hopping. I watched a video of a guy layer hopping to farm rates with the 300% exp potion on retail and he got to level 60 in 48 minutes, 70 in 10, 85 in 14, 100 in 19. In total he went from Northshire abbey to WoD opening in 1 hour and 28 minutes. 
---
That being said I'm certain it can be exploited by people looking to do so.
---
If you get Nightfall, farms consumes and are dependable you will find a casual guild pretty easily. Totems are always in demand.
---
Lol this sounds so fucking entitled.
---
You have your preference, I have mine. No need to attack people because of it.
---
god damnit I was planning to do something other than engineering this time round and now I want to engineer again
---
She was a Quel'Dorei, not a Kael'Dorei. Bruh.
---
Did you watch the video?
---
This is probably the biggest counterpoint to PVP servers. Do you want to decide if/what you can play, or let someone else decide their fun is more important than you being able to use your time to play your game?
---
Well, that blue post did say no layering in phase 2. Not that layering will be there for full phase 1.
---
The thing you are taking. How much is it?
---
What a silly outlook.  So if no streamers had been invited the beta wouldn't even exist in your mind?  There's plenty of people who aren't streamers in the beta, just look at the "Ooga Gang" for example, and Blizzard has explained why they've kept it small so far.
---
Yeah layering is dumb
---
Really mixed emotions seeing this. I’m obviously not at all happy that this system is still broken to this extreme, but I’m very pleased to see a streamer with a large audience putting a major spotlight on it. 
---
Let’s get this to the top and keep it there until Blizz comments.
---
Do you have any sort of source that says they will allow more than 4k people per server after layering is gone instead of just slapping a "full" tag on the realm and introduce queues?
---
Lul imagine this happens in the middle of burning steppes as you fly from SW -&gt; Ironforge as a level 5.
---
Half your issues can be solved by choosing a low or medium pop server at launch. One without any steamers on it.
---
How exactly does layering prevents a server dying?
---
That Josh guy is so fucking weird. Can't stand that whatever he is
---
Yeah lol, look at all this content that I can´t play.
---
I dont think it's just lack of incentive to be social. When everyone you meet is just another drop in an ocean of players, you just become numb to it. In classic you'll see the same people leveling with you throughout multiple zones. When you're forming a group for a dungeon and need one more, you might remember them and add them, or maybe you /who priest and see their name and recognize it. You have more opportunities and interactions with the same people whether you like them or not, and it's why your server reputation matters.
---
I think most people prefer the default graphics for nostalgia purposes, but I don't think there is many people that would throw a fit if they added a feature to turn on the new graphics.
---
I'm pretty sure it won't happen mostly because it doesn't line up with Blizzards goal for classic which is a preservation project.
---
Haha same. I kkiiiiinnndddd of want to do herb/alch because it still has some fun things but also I'll be useful for raids later. Buutttt many of the engineering trinkets are useful even at 60... death ray, shrink ray, discombobulator and recombulator.... the reflecting shield thingies. Ahhhhhh
---
You can't layer the 1-30 zones, you'd have to shard them.
---
I'm in love.  Please more of this, as often as you can.
---
You must not have paid attention to Warcraft 3 then since the *entire point* was to show why the faction war should be done and gone and why it's a bad thing.
---
Actually I sadly agree with you lol
---
At this point, sharding would be better. Maybe it was blizzard's plan all along :p
---
That's because it isn't a mini-achievement like it was back in the day sadly.
---
The beta is an advertising stunt more than to actually look for bugs ... This is Activision blizzard we are talking about. I wouldn't be surprised if the ooga gang was not a trio of community managers increasing the hype, from stealth as one would say
---
Layering is a solution to a problem that did not exist in vanilla. The playerbase started small and grew, now it's going to start large and shrink.
---
Ques are one issue, but the big one is, after a few months every server is going to have 50% less players.
---
Your cute little community which you've been active in, competing with, posting on the forums about, is going to be uprooted and merged with 2-3, other servers. And people are going to bitch like hell about that too.
---
There simply is no clear solution. Does blizzard get moaned at for realm merging or sharding? I guess sharding.
---
And there won't be 4x of everything as many players are going to leave, locking their items with them.
---
Blizzard has stated they want to launch with as few servers as possible so this may not even be an option.
---
You still can wait a few weeks. They will remove sharding. Actually that's what I'm going to do.
---
You okay there buddy?
---
Yeah, ok
---
Don't forget the obvious PSAs: "PSA: you can drink and eat at the same time!"
---
From this description I would say layering and sharding is the same thing. Layering is just larger scale. The core effect is that there may be people in a location that you can't see, and that resources are duplicated.
---
It's really not a superior solution to just making more servers and merging them later, in my opinion...
---
A lot of people can’t grasp this concept. Layering with be phased out as soon as servers stabilize. We absolutely need it at launch.
---
Layering needs to go right now. What happened to the no changes movement? Seems like a lot people are relaxing on this issue. 
---
#NoLayering at all in Classic.
---
Another typical over-reaction from the reddit crowd.
---
&gt;No-life guilds will be farming shit after a week in 60 zones. They’d have 3 straight weeks with no competition to do that.
---
No-lifers will have more gold, gear and resources than you. If you dont like that, play more. This is the BASIC principle of vanilla. Things are supposed to be fair, you dont get your share, if you dont put in the hours.
---
Not really - layers are really just forks of the original process. Wow servers are single threaded af. Because linux fork utilized a copy on write memory architecture, your memory footprint doesn’t really expand that substantially with each new instance. The base data, call it world data, item values, etc, etc doesn’t really change. It’s only the mobs, players, the dynamic stuff that will become unique to that instance. Honestly a very elegant way to add multithreading into a legacy system design.
---
Your statement is misleading. I don't know how you cannot see that. The meaning is entirely different too. In your example, people will show up on Monday at 1pm and wonder why the fuck you weren't specific.
---
I can get that argument for any other leader but she literally looks nothing like an undead. Like nada.
---
I could imagine that main reason was that not enough people stop playing after starting zone. So even if you shard starting zone, you still have lots of people questing in westfall, barrens and so on. Some people will stop playing after first few levels, but a lot more people will level to 20-40 levels and stop there. So the problem remains the same.
---
I've a week booked off, can't wait. the joys of 30 days holidays a year!
---
There is another issue with layering that is related to the economy that people are not really talking about.
---
It doesn't matter if one person exploit's and gets more nodes / herbs, because in the end they end up in the server economy anyway. 
---
We will have an abundance of greens blues and boe epics because we have gigantic mega servers. If blizzard underestimates the population a 10 layer server is 30k people.
---
Cataclysm model is the best imo.
---
Why are you nervous? It isn't your fault that blizzard is trash.
---
So? It's only during the first weeks. Like you rolled on different servers
---
Gallywix is fantastic as well. Exactly as I imagine him.
---
All this is understadable. I assume it would be only a good thing for Blizz to add the option to turn on/off overhaul as surerly there are players who are not going to play classic purerly due to the outdated graphics.
---
I am all about gameplay&gt;visuals as well, but I have to admit that wow passed a long way in terms of graphics from vanilla to retail and I do like what I see when logging in twice a year to the BFA.
---
r/beetlejuicing
---
Agony &gt; corruption. 
---
Also you aren't going to be using your nightfall procs while grinding. Shadowbolt is pretty inefficient and it's usually better to wand and get that passive regen.
---
Probably system chooses a layer with less people.
---
It's not an exploit if it's working as intended.  They cannot lock people out of the system to certain layers because that defeats the entire purpose of it....
---
Either you’re a troll or someone hurt you deeply.  Just because you’re not in the beta doesn’t make it an “advertising stunt” and while Activision-Blizzard has made some questionable choices over all with live WoW it’s fairly clear they’ve done what we wanted with Classic since the start.  
---
Believe me I’ve reported tons of bugs, many of which aren’t as prevalent now, and some new ones keep cropping up as time goes on likely due to their playing with code to fix one of the others.  For example as of this morning many mobs loot windows will open, loot will be visible for a split second, and then the loot window will go away without looting and there will be no way to re-loot the mob.  This is more than an advertising beta.
---
I'm planning to do the same as a healer.
---
It might take a little longer to get to max level, but I should have a hell of a friends list to help me get pre-raid BiS and attunements.
---
More than enough to permanently damage a servers economy
---
People are/were asking for sharding/layering/whatever ever since Classic got announced. In this very thread there are people who want this
---
I played vanilla back in the day, couldn’t get past level 53 by the time tbc came out, I was such a noob. But I settled for pala purely on class fantasy.
---
Now I still play the same pala or a reroll version of him back in wrath.
---
Since I didn’t get to experience the game at 60 in vanilla as a pala I’m not sure what to expect, in BC and up i played prot/holy, always made to heal in raids and tank dungeons even until BfA(yuck) it’s still my thing 14 years later.
---
Oddly enough i always play a mage when I get bored of low dps or to grind it for just pure fun, so my mage is always with me as my main alt, later on lock and hunter as well. I enjoyed a hunter on a pserver but that was a TBC server.
---
So now I’m torn, what should I level to 60 first ? Mage or pala? Or perhaps try lock for a change? I mainly PvE and avoid PvP as much as I can. I enjoy monotonous gameplay so I don’t mind spamming frost bolt, but I remember disliking ret low dps in vanilla and how slow it was especially the mana issues. 
---
I’m thinking I should combine my styles and my new found love for hunter and play a lock, get all new class quests and experience while still be high up in damage, still be a caster and can self heal (which is a big thing for me)...
---
What do you think? WSIP?
---
I rolled a Troll Rogue on a private server JUST before I learned of the Ooga Gang, now my choice feels even better. Rolling the same at launch.
---
Maybe you shouldn't be playing a MMO then
---
&gt;R.I.P. economy of high end resources
---
Explain this comment. The economy isnt some fixed system thats supposed to work one, perfect way. Its ever changing thing where every item only has ONE value. How much is the other guy willing to pay, at that second.
---
Why do you think there even doing layering? Do you think its just to throw big old wrench into classic? No, there doing it because if they do nothing launch will be guaranteed to be unplayable and probably still unplayable for a week or even more after launch because of the flood of players. Please tell us if you have a solution for this that makes launch playable.
---
&gt;No, that's the whole point. Viper sting costs less to cast than to dispel and if they're busy dispelling it they're not doing anything useful.
---
No, Viper Sting cost more than Cleanse (215 mana vs around 120 for Cleanse). Viper Sting also have 8 second CD, so you are only causing the paladin to do one more GCD every 8 second - hardly keeping them "too busy to do anything useful". Wasting your Viper Sting for that is not really a good trade off for you. It's not about wasting your GCD, its about wasting your Viper Sting.
---
&gt;Shamans just plonk down a poison cleansing totem and delete you with chain lightning.
---
I agree that ele shamans are annoying as well.
---
&gt; I doubt they can choose specific zones to phase or level
---
I answered that question.
---
I don’t think that is correct behavior.
---
Go hunter first to bankroll your warrior
---
That's my plan
---
Because she isn't the same kind of undead the players are. She's a banshee. It just so happens that looking like a pale night elf fits her look more than looking like a hunched over corpse with her spine showing. I can see what you mean though, and I can give your argument much more respect than that of the other lad foaming from the mouth above you.
---
Just because you've been living under a rock, asking for sources for stuff that everyone already knows since weeks or months, does not make it less true
---
Another cultured soul I see *twirls fancy moustache*
---
What about 150k players crammed into the same server? There are still millions of retail WoW player, they have free access to the Classic, so almost anyone will try it out.
---
i would have 0 issue with server merging. i think that's what live needs in order to get rid of sharding now
---
UC. hands down
---
What? CoA should be used. Maybe at *very* low levels it will die before CoA ends but as a general rule you are very wrong here.
---
How the fuck is server cost going down with layering? Option A with Layering: Big Server with 10 Realms (and if your point with 10 layers is correct: 100 layers) costs the same as Option B: Big Server with 100 Realms on it. Only thing is, Servermerges are much more fluent because stuff as Charnames are not messed with. And to not think the population of classic will go down drastically is just stupid. Retail players can play classic literally for free. How many of them will try it out because of hype and go back to retail because they won't get ported to the dungeon.
---
:(
---
&gt; Not that layering will be there for full phase 1.
---
It also doesn't say it wont. You are underestimating the rippling effect 4 months of fucked up economy can have.
---
Well she was a High Elf. Forsaken are all Humans. She's meant to look different.
---
I prefer the bfa model because it's distinct, faithful to her wc3:tft appearance, and has great looking armor. 
---
I I don't understand why in vanilla she had a plate chest guard and a dress. Also I never liked her sports bra, yoga pants, and thin boots outfit. She supposed to be a banshee, dark ranger, and a undead warlord, not a white girl at the gym
---
I did that in high school for my server first 80, I got “bronchitis”
---
Whatever, just uncheck invisible helm.
---
They are hot af in both full plate and leather.
---
But she is the warchief ...
---
They could have a pyramid of sharding where low level zones have the most shards, mid-level zones have moderate sharding, and high level zones have minimal sharding (as opposed to sharding simply being an on-off switch for regions). It could even be dynamically balanced such that, for low to moderate level zones, if it detects too many people in an area then it starts forking off more shards; zones with the highest level nodes would be locked to having only 1 shard.
---
If Blizzard doesn’t fix it despite being pointed out MULTIPLE TIMES people will abuse it and honestly they should - will drive people away and will be a big fuck you for not listening again
---
I don't care about the beta, playing it now would ruin the game for me. But shifting their qa tasks to the public without giving them any benefits to do this task for them (playing the game is not it, they should be paying you) is just disastrous
---
What happened to their internal QA? If you reported hundreds of bugs, then did none (say 30 people working with a contract) do any sanity testing?
---
This is what i miss from Retail.
---
Yes, lol, but as far as I know we’re safe he’s confined to Japan... for now.
---
Rycan, a priest. I joined Blood Legionnaires right around the time Naxx came out and got into the main raid group. All I remember are a few names and that the raid leader was basically the dude from the Onyxia video.
---
Server merging. Instead of freaking layers
---
He sadly doesn't really have an online presence really but his name is Bryant Mickler that didn't he horde symbol.
---
dual specs wasnt till mid wrath
---
I was under the impression that Blizzard was a great video game company.
---
I was under the impression that the Classic team were all competent video game developers who shared the passion for Vanilla like us.
---
If you ever gave Blizzard the benefit of the doubt, you were wrong and should feel ashamed or doing so.
---
Ion - https://youtu.be/jYuUD0o-Nz8?t=327
---
Omar - https://youtu.be/O3b423uqrdo?t=271
---
Did he report the exploit? ;)
---
No doubt there will be megaservers in phase 2 with 1+ hour queues every day.
---
Patch 2.3.0: The Horde and Alliance now have a limited number of reinforcements available in the battle for Alterac Valley.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_2.3.0
---
Lol but you can’t apply that at all to horde. Saying orcs, trolls, and undead are as similar to each other as humans, gnomes, and dwarves is ridiculous
---
It's just fantastic to see this game be ruined in the exact same way by the exact same people that only play the game 2  hours a week cheering them on.
---
Déjà vu.
---
Depends. Obviously the BfA Sylvanas looks awesome and badass. But the vanilla sylvanas was actually very stricken with grief and was as I recall it, humble. 
---
Is the correct answer no that they're the perfect models for each their time?
---
10 minutes? Make it at least a week. You can switch layers once every server reset.
---
I mean, it was basically made to emulate playing on different servers, but without the naming drama after merges right?
---
Client &amp; server 1.12 was exploitable as hell.
---
You would all be crying because of the cheaters / botters / gold sellers / spammers.
---
This is why we have 1.13
---
Don't think that Blizzard is paying people to rewrite something they already have just for fun.
---
The model has nothing to do with their writing.
---
I believe he asked for clip and reported bu this post should help too lol
---
It’s literally only a decent option, if they take it out of the game within the first week. Worst case week two. I realize a lot of people will still be leveling/just starting, but there will be a lot of level 60s at that point competing for world first/resources exploiting the system, after a couple weeks it’s GG.
---
I agree with you but your choice of words could have been better, that's all I'm saying.
---
That's because there are now 120 levels vs 60, so unless you're hitting 120 most don't care.
---
If the population is three times as high, then why not?
---
Sharding shares virtually none of the negative side effects to Layering
---
The retail model looks much better, but i still prefer the old model in the Classic client.
---
Low effort to shill your site. Couldn't even cut out the logos properly.
---
You can’t catch some bugs unless the servers are under a degree of load.  Other bugs crop up in oddly specific circumstances someone may not have ever replicated before.  There’s all sorts of reasons why internal testing doesn’t catch errors.  You clearly have no idea how development of this scale works and is tested though because you think allowing beta testers in and not paying them is somehow a new practice.  I was in the original Vanilla beta too.  This is standard industry practice not some Activision screw job.
---
What we now need is a confinement system to make players commit to a layer once they found their friends.
---
That would be the case if everyone was equally commited to abusing that.
---
Hardcore players and guilds will exponentially increase their gains abusing this, they will level much quicker and be safe on flasks and other stuff for a long time.
---
You could argue- isn’t the playing ground the same? No, because it shouldn’t be like that in the first way.
---
A hardcore player SHOULD be ahead of a more casual one, but he should be ahead let’s say 3 times, layering will make that gap 30 times bigger, as opposed to 3 etc..
---
Nah Blizza gave him a beta key, so he hasn't time anymore for the people that made him someone ! /jk
---
I was perpetually broke. Once a buddy introduced me to the Ironforge AH, I was looking for upgrades every day, spending down to my last gold for just one more agility point. Didn't get my first mount until into my 50s.
---
Cheers mate! Even though I find motivational speeches and videos quite irritating, there is a seed of truth behind all of them. :D
---
I don't think people would be too keen on rolling the dice every time they log in if they want to quest together. Nor one play session with friends a month. That'd be very detrimental to the game as well. I know I'd be turned off immediately if I couldn't roam, explore and quest with my buds. Really think this issue deserves some finesse instead of the ye olde Blizzard way of balancing/fixing things with a hammer.
---
Please tell me ahead of time which servers will be low pop and without streamers. I'd love to play on it.
---
We dont need it for launch.
---
it wouldn't have been asmon himself but one of his dozen moderators
---
Even so. Accidental hit.
---
How many hours did you say you were gonna be playing in a week?
---
Not just server cost but customer service expenses. Customer service is the main expense. And yes the population will eventually go down. So what? You think server merges will go away because of layering? No they will be delayed. 
---
I still don't see any points in your post that really show that layering is superior to just opening another server. Well I do see one point; save blizzard some money. But why would you be arguing for something like that?
---
Are you talking about sharding? Because phasing absolutely exists. New players still have old UC, Darnassus but not after you completed the questline. THAT is phasing.
---
Alright I'll give it another go, say you have 4000 people total wanting to go to gurubashi arena across the EU, on blizzard's sharding system gurubashi arena will be split into 50 different instances of Gurubashi arena across the entire EU so you might be in Gurubashi arena#38 with 79 people from other servers.
---
In the layering system you have 4000 people wanting to go to Gurubashi arena, because there are so many players your individual server splits the entirety of Eastern Kingdoms into two layers, one with 3000 players and one with 1000, all 4000 players are from your server and it prioritises your friends and guildmates to be on that 3k player layer. Essentially this is to help with the massive influx of players during phase 1/the first few weeks, once a certain time has elapsed and the "classic tourists" have gone the server will stop making layers and lump everyone into one united server and if you have 4k people wanting to play, you have a queue to get in.
---
Essentially it's a system that prevents dead realms after the hype has worn off.
---
I think Night Elf Priests will still be plentiful since they're a popular race.
---
*Male* Night Elf Priests however, that's unusual. I don't think I've ever seen one outside the starting zone.
---
I don't think there is anyone that "likes" layering. However it just seems like the least harmful way to deal with the issues that the launch will bring. 
---
Based on your post I'm unsure what you view as a more suitable solution that works well for both launch and the game in a month or two? 
---
That said streamers have shown us that something needs to be done to prevent layer jumping for min/maxing purposes and I'm not sure what a good solution to this could be yet. 
---
Personally I think maybe making only uncontested zones be part of the layering process to begin with would solve most of the issues, but I'm not sure whether that would break Duskwood, STV etc.  after a few weeks or if enough players have stopped before hitting those areas.
---
I can really recommend Frostadamus
---
Im with you. Layering should not be in Classic at all, ever.
---
I was planning to be all tryhard and go herb/tailoring, craft my pre-raid whatever, drop tailoring and then level alchemy but now...
---
What are you basing this off of? That's terrible logic. I fully intend on levelling to 60, but I have a job and responsibilities and life outside of the game so I don't want to waste literal dozens of hours of my free time just camping login queues for the first several weeks....
---
As an economist this troubles me, economies effect everyone regardless of their level of involvement
---
Didn't blizzard say they would shut off layering sometime  after launch?
---
Well, perplexity is one of the best vanilla wow players ever so it's expected of him to 1v3 random guys lol
---
Of course!!
---
O.k, you got me there. My lore knowledge doesn't go that deep. I just see an elf and relate to it as such.
---
So, because it didnt say how long it will last, you default your opinions to max value ? and complain when i did the same, but to the low end ? :P
---
The more black lotuses are picked up, the lower the price will be. Because you have certain demand and limited supply. Adding more supply will lower prices.
---
For you that might be "fucked up", others say its just what classics economy is supposed to be.
---
You mean asmongold
---
This still happens on retail.
---
"That deep" That's literally surface level.
---
From all I've seen layering isn't much different than sharding. 
---
Which sucks. The initial deal was going to be that we'd just have to deal with sharding for the first 10 or 15 levels. Now apparently we're going to have faux-sharding all the way to 60. 
---
The solution: Servers are servers again. Open with 5k slots to account for tourists. Many of these players will leave so, when realms drop below 2K population, offer players a free transfer to the merging with another server. This lets players feel like it's their choice, rather than forced, to merge.
---
Method josh is such a beta male 😂😂😂
---
You can activate it as you drink, but it doesnt allow you to start drinking if you're in combat. Decent to avoid ganks and give you an extra tick of hp/mana. But not as good as any other active ability
---
I don't like it but we don't have a f*cking choice do we?
---
Why do People Keep bringing up this Topic do you think Blizzard is now - after month's (maybe even years) of QQ they are now finally gonna Change their mind and take it out? They even had tests with it and everything.
---
You just have to life with it - and by trying to see the positives of layering (sharding) People try to cope with it.
---
Constantly bringing up this stupid Topic won't Change anything but People are sag/angry again. THANKS
---
Literally can't People life with things like that? The world is not perfect and it's not like Blizzard Activision has not shown that they are all about that sweet Money. Another reason why they won't Change it.
---
Just leave the Topic be and try to life with it at release. thanks
---
Im sure all nodes, herbs, chests mobs have some sort of unique ID. Just lock players of looting those specific IDs for 10min
---
The beta being streamed is definitely a publicity stunt premeditated by Blizzard. The new ooga gang trailer advertises warcraftmovies.com so they probably work for that website and have some connections with Blizzard employees. I am very excited for the game, but this is the truth.
---
Nice bro, you OWNED him. That was epic bro
---
&gt; I've got the good stuff.
---
*mon
---
You don't need to explain a system that I literally explain in the post.
---
&gt;Essentially it's a system that prevents dead realms after the hype has worn off.
---
So like a server merge?
---
do what
---
and that is what i hate of vanilla, exploits, duping, cheats and corrupted gms, the funny thing is that devs can even google those exploits, find (still) duping and other programs/methods to ruin the game. that time they don't have any excuse
---
Well, that's how sharding in retail works. The downside is that you'll teleport between world when you're changing zones and they wanted to avoid that downside for some reason.
---
Lololol the green hill of go fuck yourself.
---
you know
---
You'll level fucking slowly but you'll be a beast tank by the time you hit 60 so there's that.
---
Get rep buy tiger
---
Sure I can see that.
---
But if there is three times as many players, would that not also mean there will be three times as many hardcore players to compete with eachother, which will make it around the same.

They both dumb
---
this one right here.    
---
I did this quest twice. Once myself and then helping a friend.    
---
I was having doubts that I'm killing the right yetis, having doubts they drop it at all and so on.
---
Even after having 1 horn already in the bag the doubts returned. Took hours to get 2 horns each time.
---
NO. DO IT FAST OR ELSE !!!!!!
---
Shield slam is the highest threat generating ability followed by revenge then heroic strike. So these are your bread and butter. Make sure you are tabbing on multiple targets and cleave/sundering while keeping up demo shout.
---
what alliance race do you play?
---
No need to get testy. What you call inconvenience, I call immersion. I agree that tons of stuff is inconvenient and I completely believe it creates a more immersive environment, and therefore more enjoyable for me. I could play 100 of the most perfect challenging mechanical encounters blizzard could make, but if they’re just back to back with no world immersion in between it’s a puzzle game.
---
Please explain how Blizzard saves money wiht layering. How do you need less customer support with layering and why would more smaller servers cost more that less bigger servers? 
---
I believe with layering there will be no need for Servermerges, because I believe that classic population will be rather stable once the initial hype is gone.
---
Apologies yep sharding, phasing is of course a thing.
---
Because the best thing about ganking people was seeing them getting mad on forums.
---
Now you can see them getting mad in real time, in high resolution video.
---
They could just not do “layering” at all. Its sharding. Its phasing. Don’t let them fool us by using a different word.
---
Nah not really, I would've been pretty pissed if I couldn't get in during BC/WOTLK release. At worst it took me a few hours of crashing and lagging out, weeks? No, no thank you.
---
As we say in r/hearthstone: “ small indie company”
---
The conspiracy theories you guys cook up are astounding.  Every game, every beta, everything we do is streamed today, I’m 38 and even I know that despite not knowing who any streamers even are.  It’s not at all a Blizzard only thing.  Are they getting publicity from it?  Of course.  Is that the PURPOSE of the beta?  No.
---
I've played many games with various forms of sharding/instancing and it pretty much does? SW:TOR, Destiny had the same problems of people popping in/out of existence, for instance, SW:TOR in particular there were nice bugs where you couldn't properly get all your party on the same page.
---
All forms of sharding/instancing/layering/w.e you want to call it will have a number of effects inherent to what they are:
---
- you will have people going poof, or poofing into existence, or people not seeing their friends, or often people not even seeing a member of their party. This is because the choice of which player is on which shard is arbitrary, but you simultaneously don't want to prevent people interacting with each other between shards;
---
- you will have economic effects, because on a given shard a player would expect their ore node to stay put, which means you now need multiple copies of an ore node across shards, unless you're willing to have ore nodes poof out of reality, too (granted, I am pretty sure I saw this in retail).
---
The only difference I'm seeing to layering, maybe, is that layering may have depopulated/empty layers for zones even if there's no one there? That just seems dumb.
---
You accidentally ran under an AFK guy’s horse, centered up, and screenshotted? 
---
This is why people say gnomes are psychopaths btw
---
120 not much of an achievement other than "congrats, now you can do some halfway meaningful content with a bit of a challenge if you want".
---
It’s a good way of letting the slow player base (like me) catch up to Naxx. I don’t even think I’m going to hit 60 until sometime next year
---
Many people want community in all aspects of the game not just higher end content.
---
Truthfully, the one on the right.  Old model Sylvanas looked like some ridiculous circus clown.
---
Considering we don't have weapon skills anymore, I wanna say no. lol
---
???
---
A very small minority were asking for LFD too, but no, most people were/are 100% against sharding since the demo.
---
We don’t need no water!
---
I’m fine with that. Something needs to be implemented though. Otherwise your questing experience will be waiting and having /target macros for your quest mobs so you can spam attack and tag mobs before the other 50 people can.
---
Upvoted because people need to read this.
---
As someone who done a lot of Palatanking myself the main frustration is players simply dont get how our threat works and how it affects mana.
---
DPS casting frostbolts while I pull will indeed let us kill the pack of mobs a few seconds faster, but on the other hand I spend 20 seconds drinking after the pull instead.
---
The overall speed of the group gets slowed down. Waiting for thread shouldnt really be a problem either because Paladin tanks do dramatically more damage than the other tanks once you have the mobs attacking you.
---
how about we make something like allimania but for horde :D
---
She isn't a night elf though? Banshee's in WC3 also looked totally different to that (and to her BfA model to be fair). I get that some people prefer Classic aesthetic generally though, it's subjective thing. I think both fit both games really nicely.
---
&gt; The arguement his stream is his job yeah
---
That's not a good argument. Every job has it's pros and cons. And that's why I'd never work in something that is my main hobby. It'll eventually kill your passion.
---
Yes sir on my dwarf hunter
---
Good, less effort for the priest that will MC you out of the boat !
---
Did you guys see venrukis stream when he literally was in stv area, and teleported to another layer where the chest was spawned? 
---
I think one of the reasons this game is still in beta is just to test layering tho. Mostly...
---
Can you explain how it will affect me? I would love to know, because I'm really unaware, and I can understand that this is bad better if I would know more of the details. Feel free to message me directly if that's better for you than commenting here. I'd love the discussion.
---
But a lot of ppl will leave seeing the long queues too.
---
And servers will not be 1/4 that it was. and that 3/4 will not be farming broken tooth, tidals etc... if they leave within a month
---
Ok, cool. Thanks for the explanation. Why are people against this? It makes perfect sense to do something like this as long as it is temporary and eventually phased out. What fun would it be trying to level a character when all you can do is go AFK and wait for the area to clear out? That doesn’t sound like much fun to me. Again Maybe I am missing something.
---
not true at all, in vanilla leveling up meant something especially post 40 so people genuinely congratulated you. "ding" also came from EQ as when you leveled up in EQ it would make an actual ding sound.
---
Why the fuck would I?
---
No later than phase 1.... Could be months.
---
Why even be in asmongold's chat lol
---
pservers are already more blizzlike than classic, this is just the icing.
---
&gt;instantly get their dots and fears dispelled
---
You speak like dispells cost no mana and dispellers just have YOUR debuffs to dispell / heal.
---
Like in the first aid quest you have to do triage. Sometimes you just let a poor fucker die because you know it's too late / not worth the effort.
---
Crap.... it was tedious but worth it 100%. Probably not this time ..
---
A group of nobodies that thought it would be funny to play troll characters and have retarded sounding names and target popular streamers during a Closed Beta test so they could get the attention they've been looking for their whole life.  They're so desperate to get noticed by other people it's pathetic.  Take a look at this clip for example:  https://www.twitch.tv/videos/437594924?t=04h47m12s
---
Literally suiciding all the way to the top of Jin'tha Alor just to prevent Asmongold from looting a quest item that he needs so he can summon a boss in Sunken Temple.  They literally wait and respawn on top of him just to get noticed on stream.
---
The only reason you think they are "amazing" and "cool" is because you don't have beta keys and you are happy they are ruining the fun for popular streamers because you're mad you can't play.
---
Yeah, i hated how they didn't use High Elf model for her. I think she should have got a bit more customisation as she is so unique. Thrall is an Orc at the end of the day, but there is nothing else like her. Oh well, not a big deal.
---
cuz its sexy
---
This doesnt fix the problem, sure you could only pick one chest bit there is still the problem of going to the arena and thinking oh shit there are too many people here, let me hop to another layer. And maybe in the other one you get an easy chest that you wouldnt have gotten without layering
---
Yup. Fear, Dots, Fear. Have your pet attacking them aswell.
---
a little fyi: "ding" came from EQ as when you leveled up in EQ it would make an actual ding sound.
---
Well, the solution to that is rolling on a PvE server.
---
By rolling in a PvP server you are accepting the chance of being ganked multiple times by rogues.
---
I agree. Because you have Reckoning then any crit against you effectively translates into an extra damage that is capable of proccing Judgement of Wisdom for extra mana. Additionally you get 30% block which boost your return damage.
---
My personal strategy for 5man is to focus on HP, Armor and Spellpower. Mobs in 5man dont really hit that hard and crits should not be an issue.
---
Because blizzard decided against this for launch. 
---
It may end up happening during the layering removal though.
---
weird, yet everyone defends this when it comes to the launch of the game.
---
I feel like we got bamboozled. That this is going to turn out to be just as bad as sharding. 
---
It's like they couldn't resist monkeying with a good thing. They couldn't let things play out organically. They had to put their greasy fingers in and play with it. I was always worried that they were going to use modern systems like cross-realm and sharding but, for a while, they seemed so sincere about offering a Vanilla experience.
---
Because thats not the level the instances are intended for, Blizz has an alpha for major issues and low and behold they aren't finding bugs in those instances
---
Can't wait to fight against 30+ mages each AV.
---
Layering should be in the 1-5 lvl zones and no where else.
---
You probably keep running into him on multiple occasions because there is only 100 players in beta.
---
Wrong
---
5:40
---
See, was that so hard? Next time you find yourself in the position of not having any idea of what you're talking about, you should consider listening to others.
---
...or at least not claiming they're wrong on the basis of nothing.
---
Their servers cant handle close to what private servers can
---
Lol you’re wrong dude. You’ve literally made up a crowd of people kind your head that literally don’t exist. Yet somehow you can guarantee they’ll all come out and defend lfg????
---
The retail streamer jellybeans is a pretty awesome dude.
---
Well, he found an awesome way to redeem himself then :p
---
I registered on vanillafriends a few days ago and the first name I read is one I played with 14 years ago. I know this guy in real life we are from the same area so know each other but had much to do in real life (but played wow together).
---
I havent seen him since then also and to add on this I wanna say I am from germany and vanillafriends is not that popular of a site. Also funnily enough he is the only name in the list that i recognise. Added him on bnet and am looking forward to heal with him again :)
---
Prime example as why Sharding is fucking going to ruin classic.  Its not layers its literally Sharding.
---
I've done it, it's not terrible. Shield spec is a decent rage generator, shield blocks actually migtigate meaningful damage when soloing, and I like soloing sword and board for the mitigation and access to a spell interrupt before pummel. There's a wider variety of good 1h weapons, and getting the WW wep at 30 is a PITA if you're not twinking or supported by a guild. Iron Will is nice, Last Stand has saved many corpse runs, Imp Shield Bash and CB are both great, 1H Wep Spec is a nice dps increase and even let you DW for those times when you're grinding on lower level mobs.
---
And even though you're prot spec, there's nothing really preventing you from running around with a fat 2hander same as any other spec. You don't have the option to SS grind 2 at a time, but that's also not the safest way to play on a pvp server.
---
Prot leveling certainly isn't as theortically fast as arms or fury, but you can play to its strengths and level at a nice clip while enjoying playing as the spec you want to play end game. For me that's the biggest issue, I really like the spec-identity of my character. If I set out to be a tank at endgame, then I like to level as that spec to really embrace the feel of that spec.
---
This, the queue time will be insane
---
Funny how if they spend as much time doing things that matter (farming gold for example) they could have nice character with epic mount instead.
---
Anyway 5L is extreme, I probably don't drink that much in a year.
---
RFC when you are both 17, will be fine. get a defensive  / tank pet. Early one you can pick up which is good is a scropid in Durotar. They have +10% Armor, so take less damage. Also a Boar is good too, as they have +9% armor and +5% health, and their charge ability is pretty sick at low level. 
---
Maybe 20 can do Wailing Caverns, again isnt too tough, pop heals before entering fight  (druid gets Cat form at level 20 for better DPS). 
---
For Shadowfang keep (one of my favourite instances) - I'd say if you are both well geared from the other instances, then 24-25 should be fine.  Will just take a little time to pull sensibly. But with only two folk, getting all the XP and drops, would be well profitable.  
---
If you are sharing stuff, like gold for instance, then have professions which suit you both. Like Skinning, Herbalism, Mining and enchanting (then you can either just vendor all the trash / skin the mobs / DE all BOP blues or greens you dont need).  Should be pretty profitable for you both.
---
Blizzard will release Classic realms list before August 13th, when the Reserve Name option will kick in. Nobody knows how many realms will be available before on the list. However, we will be able to estimate what Blizzard is expecting, in terms of player base at Classic launch.
---
I will give an arbitrary example, just to understand my point.
---
Blizzard is launching 10 realms for a region, let's say NA, BEFORE the reserve name option on August 13th. This means that Blizzard is expecting 100,000 total players (with 30,000 concurrent players) to be on NA, long term, after layering is removed. This is just an example, ofc there will be much more players than 100,000 in NA.
---
Blizzard (and not only them, but pretty much everyone else) also expects a significant dropout rate after launch. That dropout rate will be, in normal conditions, 50-60%. We can expect more for Classic...but also an overlap with BfA, on Phase releases, that might temper some of the dropout, but not by much.
---
Now, this is an arbitrary example, and the dropout rate is an educated guess, and I used it as an example only for my next point, which is :
---
\-If the realm list will be SUPPLEMENTED between August 13th and launch, we will know that more people than Blizzard expected, opted for the reserve name. We won't know the number, but we will know that if there are added more realms on the list after August 13th, Classic will be more popular than Blizzard expected prior to August 13th.
---
Players that will opt for name reserve are clearly going to play long term. Almost nobody is going to sub to WoW, 2 weeks prior, to reserve a name for Classic, if they don't intend to play long term.
---
Now, let's continue with my example, if more realms are added to the list after August 13th. Let's say that Blizzard adds one more realm, so the list for NA will be 11 instead 10. Clearly this indicates a 10% more players than Blizzard expected prior to August 13th. If Blizzard doesn't add more realms after August 13th, there can be 2 explanations : either they expect a bigger dropout rate (hence, they will add more layers instead more realms), either their estimate was correct from the beginning, including how many people will reserve name, the dropout rate and the expected player base before layering is removed.
---
If we want to estimate the number of players at launch, all we need to do is multiply the realms with 10 layers. As much as optimistic I am for Classic, I expect 60% or more dropout in 3 months. And this means roughly 10 layers per realm, during Day 1 of Classic WoW launch.
---
Please give me 10 billion dollars.
---
Seems like it would work. Or a more crude solution, 30 min debuff that prevents gathering resources/chests/etc?
---
They're introducing sharding to the 1-60 Classic experience. Just let that sink in. No, we don't have to just "life with things like that". It's completely ridiculous.
---
But you called it sharding, you didn't explain the system at all. As for a server merge, not really, it's not like it's two different server communities being lumped together, you're still one server and you'll be seeing all theses players as you level and play depending on server load when you log in or as you group with people.
---
I wasn't aware that some people enjoy the aspect of camping a dead quest mob with 5 other groups playing who-can-tag-it-first.
---
Which one burned Teldrassil down for no good reason? Yeah, not that one.
---
If he dies, he dies.
---
You know there's a version of wow to play that focuses on "sexy" mounts and stuff like that right?
---
Our only real info to go on here is Ion discussing RP-PVP servers and he mentions RP servers will exist in the 'larger regions'.  
---
Which suggests there are smaller regions! Which is us! My baseless optimism cannot be touched
---
More like competitors.
---
Layering is good guys. LAYERING IS GOOD. Say it with me - LAYERING IS GOOD.
---
STOP LAYERING AND SHARDING!!!
---
Thanks! So much later than I expected
---
Gollum streams on twitch?! I thought he fell into the volcano
---
New model is clearly better. Old VOICE though? Old voice wins.
---
Small world...
---
yea but this one you gotta work very hard to get it and its the only one in the game
---
I never said she was a night elf. I just said the night elf model looks more like what she's supposed to look like than the undead model. At that point the only way to make her at all relatable to the players is to give her a night elf model. A playable race from the other faction, but a playable race nontheless. And what do all other faction leaders have in common? Ahh, yes, they all use the models of playable races. Just in case someone asks "well why not just give her a banshee model?".
---
I hope at least most people here are aware that unique high elf models weren't a thing in vanilla (at least not good ones). And even then, making her relatable to the players through her model would still be an issue. There is no horde playable race that resembles a banshee OR a high elf in the slightest, so they went with the second best thing.
---
How this is escaping anyone is beyond me. I'm not even saying she looks great. I'm just saying I prefer this because I like the idea of faction leaders (and big-name NPCs in general) looking like the players. I figure the concept is pretty simple.
---
Damn, I also purchased premium to download my old pvp movie and the links were dead.
---
Doing that movie made me really proud at the time and it was a shame that I couldn't get it back.
---
Luckilly someone did god's work and uploaded it to some youtube channel so I could download it back &lt;3
---
Yep. The exact fear everyone had when layering was first announced brought to fruition. Just praying they'll enforce a more aggressive policy on switching layers, stuff like that CAN'T happen.
---
I'm glad I'm not retarded. Life must be so difficult for you.
---
I can’t even imagine why you wrote a wall of text to prove my point, but thank you
---
Cause his army of followers who all wanna lick his arsehole watch every single fucking asmontwot video so YouTube assumes that everyone who likes WoW likes the autistic social reject that is asmondouche. Though I semi agree with a system to deal with stream sniping, the blacklist is a bit much, or atleast would be an ineffective and drastic system.
---
You know how people joke about old games having spaghetti code? Your solution is how that happens.
---
Mafia is not even an issu, assuming the top ally and horde guild team up and no one on the server gets even one piece of rich veins or leather where is the problem?
---
Just don't buy their stuff, you don't need it to progress anyway. Player created problems, players can solve em. Or just fight back with more people.
---
Yeah, I think that breaking immersion with barely noticeable zoning is worth not risking someone playing 20 hours/day for the first week to get to 60 in 5 days and then immediately stock piling the highest level resources by abusing layering prior to it being phased out, completely destroying the economy for the server.
---
You don't need to stick up for the streamers bud.
---
It's funny.
---
Yes, but in this case it isn't a bug.
---
Layering is working as intended, so there's nothing for them to "fix".
---
Man the trolls are out in full force today.
---
That's sharpie lmao
---
This Guy sounds so amazing😂😂
---
&gt; A warrior is a slow leveling class. If you are playing an average of 19 hours per week and your leveling speed is normal you will probably ding level 60 somewhere around...
---
&gt; Tuesday 31 December 2019
---
Welp, looks like the site knows I have no friends :'(
---
This is a clear example of you writing the history you remember, but wasn’t actually the case. There were plenty of people defending it right from the get go. 
---
Some of you seem to be more worried about who’s on what side of layering rather than how we fucking make sure it gets fixed to be as nonintrusive and non game-breaking as possible.
---
That's why layering is a stupid idea and they should go with server merging afterwards instead.
---
I was begging for gold in Stormwind to buy my first mount. After a while this gnome rogue trades me the gold I was missing. Some time later I pay him back and don't think of it anymore.
---
A few weeks later we end up at the same LAN-party, turns out this rogue was my friends step brother.

---
In this thread there's comments with hundreds of upvotes in support of layering. Are you blind or something?
---
No no no. Why are you assuming it's working as intended? Are you a Classic Wow dev? You think they intend for players to layer hop and get multiple chests and other loot? Come on, man. Grow up.
---
Thanks for the info. I'll check your discord out for sure.
---
How much better is mcp? I'm pretty averse to the thought of constantly having to farm a lvl 30 weapon just to maximize my dps.
---
Isn't the extreme lack of crit chance a big problem in the early raids?
---
What would you choose at weapon enchantment? iron counterweight for a little bit of haste, lifesteal for the dmg proc or good ol crusader?
---
Also, you refer several times to a waradin. What exactly is that? A ret, who fully gears like a fury warrior? I've theorycrafted a conventional ret paladin and in endgame dream gear I had that at ~950 ap and ~190 sp (+wrath of cenarius). Would that be a waradin or more of a hybrid?
---
Well a hunter would be much better, especially when you have to do dungeons. Or a class that can heal.
---
I think the issue in Classic is that you'd need to Run to the instances. Where as previously you could just queue up and go for it. 
---
While I think it'll be easy if you want to instance to 60, as there will always be groups looking for either a tank or DPS, which as you level you can do both.  The only issue is that it could take a lot longer. But who cares, if this is your choice and how you enjoy playing then go for it!
---
but people already clear MC within week 1, thats an entire week of massive overflow of resources.
---
&gt; We’ll launch Classic with content from original WoW through patch 1.2.x, then the second update will include content that was in original WoW 1.3 and 1.4, the third Classic update will have 1.5 and 1.6 content, and so on.
---
While not explicitly saying anything about quests, “content” generally means anything released in those timeframes. So it is better and safer to assume they mean ALL content, not just dungeons.
---
They’ve mentioned 1.10 item drops as well, but not the items added into MC (and the revamp) that occurred in 1.4. However, it’s assumed that since it was content from phase 2’s patch content, it won’t be present until then. So no Benediction for priests, no bow/staff/quiver for hunters. Same for the lvl 50 sunken temple class quests (which contains the devilsaur eye)
---
I know much of it is assumption, but if you prepare for the worst then you’ll have a nice surprise when it’s not.
---
Exactly why it's going to exist for a few weeks is the reason they won't bother with it.
---
Anyone remember how well they patched all the bugs from BfA beta for the release? Me neither.
---
Where’s the link to the survey?
---
Hell no. It takes what I think 800 quests or something like that? I'm just going to get the PVP mounts and call it a day.
---
&gt;Sharding is supposed to apply to, at most, level 1-30 areas.
---
That's the big thing that I was reluctantly okay with. That it would END. That there would be a point where it would go away. Now, with layering, I believe that it will go all the way until Phase 1 and I half expect that they will extend it beyond that indefinitely. 
---
They are showing exactly the sensibilities that I feared: convenience &gt; organic experiences. This layering this is the behavior that follows that attitude.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=1399/magic-candle ? 
---
Annoying to farm vs. crafted by engineer, or is there a reusable one??
---
It is weird. Was the streamer in a raid or a group? Was he taking a boat? What happened after? Was he denied access to EK?
---
People on privates did fine when launch had 8000+ people.
---
Just make lines, group up or go explore/flight points/fishing if you want to play day 1, explore xp to level 2-3 and clear level 6+ mobs in a party. 
---
Guess low IQ players want Blizzard to hold their hand instead.
---
what horde race are you rolling?
---
The same way blizzard saves money by not having items bind as soon as you pick them up. Customer support expenses. There was a big hubbub about it when they were going to make items tradable. And even then they did not totally concede they reached a compromise. 
---
&gt;I believe with layering there will be no need for Servermerges
---
Yeah that's what most people think. And yeah you wont get server merges for months and months, but you wouldn't get them for months and months anyway so who cares? I think you mean *QUEUES* which we will still probably have on release. 
---
People keep using this go-to as an example, but when did classic servers even get to the point where they needed merges during the original release? Not months after release. Hell I remember WoW adding servers if anything. This is a "maybe" problem that is easily solved with a merge if it is really bad.
---
I have a few characters on a dead realm. I literally had to reroll those 3 classes (fuck paying that much for a server transfer) on another server because the game was unplayable, and that’s with cross realm grouping...
---
Horde tattoo on my leg... Been Alliance for years now. =\\
---
I think I got summoned more often in TBC than I did in vanilla, now that you mention it.
---
Started playing WoW with WOTLK Release, played Rogue ever since and I considered doing so again in Classic. HOWEVER, watching rogue streamers lately got me thinking that it is very slow paced. Also in PvE it seems like you're only spamming SS - SS - SS - SS - SS - Eviscerate.   
---
Does that change at 60 ??
---
The "level squish" question isn't about classic either. They are thinking about doing a similar thing that stats/damage squish or item level squish were, but with player levels in the next expansion.
---
Like when the new expansion comes out - lvl120 players will be set to lvl50 and lvl60 will be the new cap, for example.
---
Ironically enough i have always had great luck with Zhevra hooves drop rates. Murlocs on the other hand...

---
Blacklisting streamers is just as bad as streamers blacklisting stream snipers. No add on like this existed in classic. Grow up.
---
Every early zone will be full of players trying to kill a limited number of mobs. People won't progress like they should so using layering blizzard can get  far more people through the first ten levels faster and allow the population to spread out.
---
Running into the same player in twice on the world?
---
Yeah right....
---
Really, another post about this?
---
It is WAY to late in the race to change this part of Classic. It is what it is, we just have to deal with it.
---
I know plenty that seem to like it, but it pretty much makes getting people to log on to raid a nightmare.  I personally find it boring and think the concept of farming the better ilvl version of the same items all expansion is one of the worst ideas that's ever been kept around for multiple expansions.  
---
It also encourages people to act awful because there's a timer attached, and with cross server  lfg you'll probably never see the same people again anyway.  
---
It is, in my opinion, the antithesis of everything the classic game is.
---
Have them not spawn at the same location. It's not like only one persion is going to farm nodes.
---
Imagine people doing with devilsaurs. You can basically kill the entire server economy in a day. And I thought the Devilsaur Mafia on the private servers was bad enough, guess there will be multiple exploiters abusing it now.
---
Yes I understand all factors of this. I have been lurking this reddit since classic announcement.
---
I have seen all the thousands of Posts on this even a year ago People were already complaining.
---
Blizzard changed nothing when they still had the Chance to Change it. They will surely not Change anything now. 
---
And while I think it's good to speak out about things you dislike and want to be changed. I also think that you got to realize when it is too late for it to be changed and let People get used to the thought of having it in the game at release.
---
By constantly bringing up the negative Points you are just startling a shitstorm again and give People negativ thoughts.
---
I just think it is unneccesary but maybe I just feel that way because I have spoken and thought about it for too Long...
---
What is your leveling combo? What are we working with here today. Because this is a huge factor of something we should know based on the classes determines the ability to do other things aside from grinding.
---
Guild Wars 1 had this system and it seemed to work great, although it had far less players than WoW.
---
Popularity = / = Quality
---
If viewership meant best, then Fortnite is the greatest game ever made.
---
Ok goodie! Another post in this topic!
---
I work with someone who played on the same server Eldre Thalas, back in Vanilla and TBC . We didn't meet until 10 years later. Knew some of the same people too. Random.
---
While people have already mentioned having to deal with WOTF, it’s not as bad as people make it out to be. I ran with a 3 warlock crew for PVP during my R14 grind and those guys ripped shit up, they never once complained about undead. 
---
The horde on the other hand always complained about how unfair Paladins were. So take that into consideration if your pvp will be hardcore. 
---
Otherwise, play whatever race you enjoy most.
---
The technology is amazing, it just shouldn't be used in a MMO lol

Why?
---
refreshing how someone who seems to have no idea how server structures work (saving money how?) guarantees us something bad will happen in 3month. please tell us more
---
The design of the gear is objectively worse than the vanilla gear though which is honestly kind of insane. Talking about the tier sets not the leveling gear.
---
IIRC Joana had his record on an Oceanic server, so his ping might affect your numbers.
---
I don’t get how blizzard can’t come up with something better. They have talented people on their team, no? Surely they can see the potential of classic, fork over the money for a better solution ffs.
---
AQ is a different event than people waiting in line for killing mobs at level 2.
---
I dont think there is any need to "catch up". Many folk are saying Phase 2 will not occur till Jan 2020, meaning even casual players should still reach level 60 within those 4 months, even playing 5 hrs a week, you'd still nearly have 12-13 days played by Jan 2020, so should be fine.  
---
Dev's dont need time to prepare/polish for what to do after naxx.  Even in Vanilla, less than 1% of folk were in Naxx after 2 yrs. Doubt that'll change much at all.
---
&gt;Constantly bringing up this stupid Topic won't Change anything
---
It actually can change if people get mad enough about it. The past few months should have shown you this. Why is this topic reduced to 
---
"We all know it sucks, deal with it they wont change it"?
---
The reason of the beta was for people to voice what was wrong or what they did not like. Well this is something an obvious large potion of the community hate. Regardless if they change it or not we have to say whats wrong about it.

---
Wasn't layering meant to be exclusive to starting zones or am I incorrect?
---
Lets not forget rare recipes or the elemental fire grind. Layering will ruin the game forever if its 2weeks, turboautists will grind this stuff on adderall with wake up calls at night for 24/7 farm efficiency.
---
Go back to sucking asmon’s hairless taint you garbage can
---
Never understood why people where interested in that kitty. Always preferred a proper horse.
---
Prehots are your friend. as well as FFF as the mob comes running in.  The tab swipe causes your swipe to hit the main target then 2 others. So tab swipe and maul you will easily be able to keep aggro if you prehot yourself.
---
Is it harder to gear a rogue or mage in raids?
---
Yes!!!!  I haven’t thought about that shirt in years!
---
“Showed them countless clips of streamers switching layers on demand”
---
Ok seriously dude? First off we didn’t have the beta to show anyone anything at first, so that’s not even possible. Now there are a few examples we have of some weird layering mechanics happening, that go against how blizz even said they wanted it to work.
---
So your answer is RERrRrERereeeere at some imaginary people who want to destroy your precious wow and literally make shit up about your imaginary crowd of blizz white knights. It’s just weird to see this thread and you guys going batshit at the wrong stuff/people.
---
How about we continue to point this out to Blizz and make clear that this is a big problem that needs to be addressed and see how they plan to fix it instead of throwing a hissy fit? Just a thought.
---
It's intended as in there should be 3+ layers on said server, each one with it's unique items, chests, rare spawns etc
---
The layer hopping may not be intended, but the layering system is working just like the Classic WoW Devs said it would.
---
I remember, and for a while I thought the twitch streamer Nymn is the same guy and was the reason he was a popular streamer.
---
Salty scorpid bloods. Hands down the worst quest item to try and get.
---
A lot of nobodies I've never heard of exist.
---
I remember this fondly.  Also trying to go from Redridge to Burning Steppes.
---
"Question mark question mark, what's that mean??"
---
\*dead\*
---
People assumed we would get sharding in starting zones because it was briefly discussed. We ARE getting continent wide layering up to the end of phase 1.
---
When doing the vaults of archivon in wotlk in a random raid i mentioned as we were waiting for the stragglers that i didnt mind waiting as i was snowed in (I'm a brit who had moved to Stockholm) and another guy said he was too, he asked where, etc etc, turns out he lived in the next train stop along my route into the city centre, very small world.
---
The ex who I was living with told me she raided with a couple for years to eventually discover they lived in the same street almost.
---
I do love these little coincidences, the connections and friends I've made over the years have been amazing.
---
by then the game is ruined forever, adderall fueled top end guilds clear ragnaros within the first week and farm tons of materials.
---
Sounds fair so us casuals can catch up
---
*should have
---
because at the start of the game, you will need FAR more than 3 layers per server to alleviate the initial rush. That's why no-lifers who get to 60 in 5 days will be able to abuse the huge amount of layers that open up to accommodate initial rush.
---
I have a beta key, and I think this is hilarious. Streamers literally make this kind of thing easier to do. People are going to troll on PvP servers (pun intended). So what if they gank your precious streamer?
---
How can you "guarantee" that, when literally nobody knows how many servers we're getting at launch?
---
On the one hand you're using hyperbole saying servers will have 10 layers (around 3k on each layer) so 30k pop per server, and now you're saying in addition to that, there will be queues?!
---
The tech does have its issues. The most obvious issue is that it simply wasn't in classic and that alone is enough for many to be against it. It also allows weird edge cases like the one shown in this post where people can layer-hop for the chance to get double spawns of something like the arena chest.
---
world buffs are ridiculously op and having them at every raid will trivialize the content.
---
Selecting layers just like selecting a realm might be the easiest solution, yet it comes with it shares of problem. I really like the idea of layers being kinda different realms, yet "pre merged" together. You basically play normally, but you know that you don't have to be worried about low pop or high pop situations. But selecting (or auto selecting) a layer before entering, means that you can't join your friends and that is a big problem. So you log in when there's only 2 layers? Fine, you get on Hellscream 2. Your friend logs in later and gets on Hellscream 3 because 1 and 2 are now full. How do you guys get to play together, knowing that if we could still layer hop with invites, it could be exploited? Would it means that layers should have queues just like a regular high pop realm? Should the player on layer 2 log off to go play with his friend on layer 3? These are some of the questions.
---
This. When I queued for BGs I would just sit outside the portal until the BG popped, so when it ended I could go back and re-queue. It didn't bring me out in the world, it forced me to camp in a certain spot. At least in cities we could duel and multi-task
---
Going on the official Blizzard forum to ask a question.
---
Never again.
---
&gt;Blizzard are not psychic - they have no way to accurately predict population evolution over the first six weeks, say. Imagine you play on a server that started with 20k players, but after the six weeks drops to only 12k.
---
Blizzard could help themselves to better predict the starting population.  Classic should be on a separate subscription from retail.  Allowing anyone subbed to retail into classic makes it impossible to know how many to expect at the start.  If you had a separate sub, you'd have real world numbers to help predict population.
---
i agree with you, but not for everything. Armor visuals have been very bad lately
---
\&gt;Based on your post I'm unsure what you view as a more suitable solution that works well for both launch and the game in a month or two? 
---
Buy more servers. That's too hard and complicated though. 
---
\&gt;That said streamers have shown us that something needs to be done to prevent layer jumping for min/maxing purposes and I'm not sure what a good solution to this could be yet. 
---
Good luck with that, there is nothing they can do that I can think of. Even if they make it so you can't pick what layer you're on, what's to stop you from joining a randos group and getting pulled to his layer or vice versa? If they disable this, people can't play with their friends when they want to. It's a lose-lose for layering.
---
you can do barkskin+hurricane (around 60% damage reduction on yourself by the negative attack speed) on any pack with multiple non elite mobs like scholomance whelps to aoe tank easily as feral.
---
Again, you assume blizzard wants ppl to have a fast L1-5 experience. It actually might be that they want the REAL vanilla experience and only care that the servers will work. 
---
And let you kill the L2 wolfs there for a week, if that is required.
---
Ah okay, thanks for the reply!
---
Okay, these guys are playing minecraft not wow classic, youre right mine fault.
---
Well, the "worst to quest in" is probably STV on PVP servers, but it's also one of the most fun. You just won't get much done.
---
As for a zone I just flat-out don't like, I never took to Arathi Highlands. Way too much green nothing.
---
Alliance has the edge in PvE and PvP. It's not like Paladins are bad in PvP situations.
---
\- Don't spawn layers unless the area is overly populated
---
\- Don't recycle layers ( that is if you have 3 layers in zone and you go back down to 2 and back to 3, 3 doesn't refresh any of  it spawn timers).
---
As long as those rules are intact this won't be a big deal. It's the same concept of having more than a single High Warlord.
---
Yo Hire, blizzard this guy.
---
How does layering save customer support tho? Items not binding and be tradeable is obvious. But why would someone submit a ticket that he would not submit without layering? If anything at all they have more tickets with that bugged layering. 
---
Blizzard added Servers in Classic because population was rising. I truly believe, that classic population now wont be rising. 
---
The problem with 100 Servers now is, that the hype will die rather quickly and than you would have plenty dead servers within few months (at least that is what I think and obv. blizzard thinks the same hence why they made layering).
---
And a server merge is never an easy solution. Merged Servers are immersion killers. You walk by another guy with your same name? That other guy has a Server-Tag in its name? Or you need to change your name because of the merge? I prefer layering at the start of classic over merges 100%
---
I don't think you realize how old boomers are.
---
So I am torn between a warlock and a druid.  I love tanking, I was a feral off tank all through TBC. Ive been watching a lot of youtube about druid tanks and it seems like they are actually viable if you can convince a guild to take you and you get the right gear.  I had a resto druid back in the day and I know I don't want to play resto again.
---
What are the chances of convincing a guild to let me tank as feral?  I think for 5 mans there isn't much of a stigma attached if I remember correctly.
---
I also want to try out a warlock. The class fantasy is cool and I really like the idea of pets. I think they are also a strong solo class as well.  Not bad in PVP right? I remember them being buffed a lot by the end of vanilla.
---
I'm just worried that if I level a druid and don't get into a guild I'll have to restart with a warlock to raid and that is a pretty big time commitment.
---
&gt; I don’t get why they’d pour all this energy into a Classic reboot but suddenly introduce a system that destroys immersion and is exploitable
---
Because it would be worse to spend all this energy on creating a game that is unplayable with huge queues and server crashes. Remember how people reacted to the stress tests? It would be a lot worse than that on launch.
---
I think it's pretty natural to almost go to every zone at one time or another to quest, I usually avoid hillsbrad pretty much though as horde.

---
Could make it so the player can't switch to another layer for 20 minutes or so like in bdo
---
A few weeks time is completely incorrect. This will have lasting effects months in th3 game because the players won't sell the inflated goods until 1. More players reach 60. And 2. The phasing ends. 
---
This will absolutely fuck up the economy.

I'm not as confident about Horde, but from memory Trolls were always the rarest. This is based on casual taste, since reddit overestimates how many people will min/max.
---
Good stay there
---
Yo Jesus this community seems so schizophrenic. It's a beta yo..... They have been testing iterations of layering since it started. Not just during the stress test. They are literally changing how layering works on a daily basis. 
---
This is what the beta is for. To test layering in a live player situation and tune it before launch. If you actually believe this is how it will launch, you're crazy.
---
Just chill guys. Launch is quite a ways away. Many patches to go yet.
---
blizzard fans have room temperature IQ, a company that shit in their mouths for almost a decade straight gets defended regardless of context. Fascinating really.
---
What the fuck.
---
FFFFFFFAAASSSSSTTTTT
---
Is there an equivalent grind for this on Horde?
---
Screenshot this post, and get back to me when you are in a queue waiting to join your server on launch. Will it be bad? No. But it will be there. Always has. Too many people want to play on launch. Even with sharding there were queues, and now we have layering and you think they will go away? No, there will be a queue, it will just be shorter than an hour.
---
Yeah leveling in Hillsbrad is a pain on Horde. On the pservers TM is always being camped so you just hope you can click the quest buttons quicker than the rogue or pally can press their buttons.
---
I’m sorry but I’m a dumbass, can someone explain what is being done to cause the layering?
---
This completely kills the purpose of an MMO. They've already tried their best to turn  BFA into single player game. Red flags are everywhere.
---
Devilsaur farming guilds can outfit their DPS in the best gear nearly immediately 
---
flask availability, if guilds have 3 weeks to farm 60 zones hopping between 10 layers, potentially nearly everyone could have flasks for the first few runs
---
This translates to instant full clears of MC starting 2nd week and that faction can dominate and throw its weight around the actual world, monopolizing devilsaur even worse.
---
with a huge rush of supply of devilsaur and Lotuses, items that typically require a LOT of gold will suddenly be abundant. Flasks for example typically require over 100g in Classic and they will be significantly cheaper with this abusing.
---
Then, lower level items will be jacked up in price because mage AOE farming will give them huge gold inflows to snatch up any levelling items they or their alts may need.
---
So TL;DR: 1-59 items will be more expensive, lvl 60 endgame resources will be so abundant they'll be cheap and hoarded by guilds who will clear subsequent raids with ease, increasing their power lead in a way that wasn't meant to happen in actual Classic
---
I think, but could be wrong, is what they may be saying  is that only allow layering within Capital Cities.  When you are out in the world, there is no layering.  I would even go as far as to say make this a thing within the starter zones also.  Everywhere else, normal no layering.
---
The short version is that layering allows advanced players to shift between layers and maintain control of known spawns of resources and sell them at whatever price they see fit. 
---
Sharding in low level areas could tank prices of items on the AH which would impede lower levels or more casual players from accruing the gold they need to participate in the economy.
---
High price endgame items require more gold to be bought so anyone trying to pay for those items must sell things at a higher price. It’s a sort of inflation driven by scarcity as opposed to inflation driven by a centralized source increasing total gold in the economy.
---
These are both assuming the auction houses are server wide. I don’t see how AH could be split by layering or sharding in anyway 
---
My initial reaction was because I live in DC so politics are a common topic for discussion and many people say similar thing me about the economy not affecting them and it drives me crazy.
---
Beta is like an ice cream. You can eat it when melted and its awesome, but if youll wait for it to freeze, youll enjoy it even more... + the less you eat melted the more you'll have frozen... god that was deep..

Black Lotus was only BoP until Patch 1.7.
---

---
New one wtf is there to debate. The first one could be any fucking night elf.
---
Holding off server mergers is very important (maybe for monetary reasons, but also for the impact it has on players with changed names guilds being disbanded etc) and I don't see how more servers vs layering falls out in favor of more servers. 
---
I would imagine if you did a lot more servers vs using layering you would have a server cap at roughly 5-6k. But at what point does blizzard then decide that the servers is so dead it needs to merge. How do you ensure that old guilds can actually play together at the same server again at launch since it would likely only take a day for most of the first servers to be full, thus splitting up irl friends or guilds.
---
Reeeeeeee
---
Yeah that was great, I still have them all downloaded from when YouTube downloaders were a thing.
---
&gt;you default your opinions to max value ?
---
That's what they said in interviews. They went from first week to whole phase 1.
---
What? It rather looks like this is there to prevent Xrealm.
---
I agree. Sharding I was uneasy with but at least it ended at a point.
---
Now layering is the entire world, and they say it ends after a month.... more than enough time for no-lifers to ruin an economy and get a huge guild-lead.
---
The other thing that worries me is people are saying, a potential fix is allow layer swapping *only inside major cities or rest areas*..... 
---
YEAH because that's what we want to see when we enter SW or Org.... people vanishing!
---
&gt;saving money how
---
Customer service costs but if you actually read the post you would know this. 
---
&gt; guarantees us something bad will happen in 3month 
---
I never even said anything bad would happen, the only statement I made was that there would be queues.
---
Next time at least read my post before you assemble a poorly written reply.
---
blizz wont fix anything regarding layring ,,,,, just my humble opinion. They are clueless.

you know whats bad, dungeons! did you know there can be literally THOUSANDS atthe same time?
---
we will end up with
---
THOUSANDS x more Hand of Justices
---
THOUSANDS x more Ironfoes
---
THOUSANDS x more Herbs/Ores farmed in dungeons
---
THOUSANDS x more cloth and money
---
we should just male a queue for every dungeon......
---
I dont want to defend Layering / Sharding or whatever the fuck they come up with. I just make fun of people who treat it like it is the black plague.....
---
smoother leveling for a few weeks and a kickstart on server economics whats the problem? oh right you are worried that you cant exploit it and are afraid you are missing out on something
---
Old Blizz put player experience #1 ahead of everything.
---
New Blizz is simply a corp that puts shareholders and cost ahead of everything.
---
Sylvanas is a just a Night Elf, the BFA version is just overdone.
---
Also, Vanilla had blob shadows so fuck that Vanilla version too.
---
You realize we are talking about this in terms of vanilla right?  Leveling 4 warriors from 1-110 has absolutely nothing to fucking do with vanilla. They might as well be entirely different games. 
---
Are you intentionally trolling?
---
Yeah, it can be higher. Or lower. But except Vanilla, all other WoW expansions suffered the same droput, which was the main reason Blizzard added the "new patch-new gear" cycle every 3 months.
---
What was different for WoW, in the past, was that the influx of NEW players was higher than the dropout rate, from Vanilla all the way to end of MoP.
---
Could this happen to Classic also? Possible, but highly improbable, because of BfA player base.
---
We don't know how many BfA players will login to Classic at launch, could be 100k, could be 1 million. But the vast majority will do it for giggles, and will leave in couple days. That is an influx of players that will also leave, increasing the overall dropout rate.
---
RP streams on GTA5 are really popular
---
Stv
---
Agreed, starting population is one thing. The drop-off is the other thing, but having separate subscriptions would significantly reduce the initial population decline as well. 
---
It's going to be different for every server too. Servers with popular guilds - Retail and private server ones - will be packed for the foreseeable future, and I have no idea how they could ever hope to disable layering on those. Same with streamers, where a huge chunk of a server's population will vanish overnight if/when they move on to another game.
---
I'd have to agree with STV. There was always all sorts of trouble there.
---
You’re honestly delusional. I don’t even see ten of those people in this entire thread. Take a deep breath, everything is gonna be just fine. We’re in beta, this team is communicating, they’re listening. This isn’t even working as intended. Let’s keep bringing up these issues and posting when it happens, and stop pointing fingers at imaginary groups of people.
---
Nope, I'm gonna be leveling at least two Horde toons before I even think about Alliance.  And if I do ever get around to an Alliance toon, it is gonna be a paladin.  And since it would be a paladin, I will have a different time consuming mount quest.
---
Oh how bad, you cannot take a day off at launch without problems so you rather gut the game permanently in terms of economy.
---
Rope is over there.
---
Whats wrong with fortnite being one of the greatest games ever? Dont get me wrong here I actually never played fortnite because I dont like Battle Royals but if the game is shit why are so many people playing it?
---
The raids are some of my all time favorites.
---
IMHO theres a lot of really cool looking vanilla models. fNE for instance is probably a fan favorite for animations and the way armor looks on it. I know other people have a soft spot in their heart for other races like fOrc or some of the dwarf face.
---
Bfa models kinda nuked that and while they improved a lot they lost a lot of things people held dear. Legion/bfa was the first time I could stand playing mNE because the animations were so much better.
---
It may inform and help other players realizing how bad layering is, and how much pressure we need to put on Blizzard if we hope for an actual true-to-Classic game.
---
You'd think the company that owns the IP and makes millions of dollars per year would have the intelligence to fully think this through
---
There’s a raptor in Un’goro.
---
This is the sort of stuff I believe Blizzard is wanting to test more so others and I hope they are able to learn a lot in the next few weeks
---
Not in Classic.
---
&gt; after a few months every server is going to have 50% less players.
---
I see this parroted often but I don't believe it.  That's not enough time to accomplish anything on Classic, people play BFA because there is no better MMO.  Classic will change that.
---
&gt; you’ll be in the top % of people at 60 so end content will be limited until the general population can catch up 
---
This sounds like a good position to be in. That time can be spent leveling your professions and farming while you have very little competition in the higher zones.
---
I'll be playing undead rogue most likely. That was my main and I really enjoyed it.
---
I've thought about changing it up and going Orc, but WoTF is great and cannibalize is awesome for leveling.
---
Realms are not the same thing as servers, it's not 2004.
---
It is completely irrelevant how many realms they have regarding how much server capacity is allocated to classic.
---
Layering has nothing to do with server capacity. It has to do with population. 
---
If they have a realm that has 3 layers for example, that's 3x3000 people, if they have 3 realms with no layering instead that's 3x3000 people.
---
Dynamic spawns
---
When a guild starts clearing MC two weeks early before anyone else, because their players are all jacked on flask and devilsaur which they farmed, they can then push their players into the world and monopolize ALL devilsaur layers and lotus spawns, FURTHER growing their lead.
---
it matters what happens to the economy too.
---

Super.
---
People need the chill the f up, this is a work in progress. If it smoothes just the launch, it can be a welcome shitty change. They did say it wouldn't stick for more than some weeks, and there's time to make sure this doesn't happen again. Get nervous in mid July or start of August, not now...
---
Blizzard is trying to give us the *least expensive* Classic, not the best Classic, as evidenced by layering.
---
shut up baldhead boomer
---
If you are in the game make sure to forward it as a bug report - bug or not, intended or not if half the server is reporting a like issue it will be either looked into and fixed or modified
---
&gt; I also remember not seeing many other hunter tame the tigers in Winterspring, and getting compliments. Maybe because there weren't as many resources?
---
When I hit 60 on my hunter I tamed frost saber or whatever they are called in winter spring. The purple bluish ones. Then I learned that there was a hidden epic mount the winter spring saber to optain but gated behind a massive time commitment because of the rep farming. Since I was nowhere near the gold for an epic mount I thought fuck it I will do it. How cool will it be if I am in my mount and have the exact same tiger running besides me? So I farmed and farmed the reputation needed and on the way got my gold together. Then I finally could afford it both gold and reputation wise and I felt soooo good. It was everything I wanted.
---
Then one patch later blizz removed hunter pets beeing visible while beeing mounted because they would sometimes bug out lol. I felt so betrayed.
---
A layer is the size of a vanilla server. So even with layering, the ratio of nodes to players is exactly the same as vanilla.
---
If I remember right a stack of 20 could sell for 20-30G
---
Don't quote me on that though.
---
Did you watch the video? It's rife for exploitation - think about the first group of people who get to level 52ish and start farming Arcanite in EPL. You find a nice cluster of arcanite nodes, farm it, swap layers, farm the same cluster, swap layers, farm the same cluster, etc. while the guy who's running all around the map on a 40% mount is getting next to nothing. The first dude corners the Arcanite market on the auction house and can pretty much control prices from there. Then extrapolate that out - people who exploit layering could lock down rare mob spawns, chest spawns, you name it.
---
Getting ganked by Alliance? Ah fuck it, swap to a different layer and you're good. Don't want to share yeti farming with someone else, just swap layers.
---
It's not the end of the world because it's only a temporary system. But if even a few people abuse it, they can have severe impacts on the economy and enjoyment for others. Last but not least, many people are hype for classic because it forces you into social situations. World pvp was way more common. You actually have to run places, take zeppelins, that kind of stuff. Come to think of it, can you even queue for battlegrounds from Org in the version they're going live with? At one point, you had to literally run to the battleground to queue for it. Layering has the potential to remove that social aspect and be abused, unless they find a good solution in the next few months.
---
how the fuck does layering affects customer support expenses?
---
Thank you for criticizing my english. Since its not my first language i am prone to make mistakes or write in an none intuitive pattern.
---
First thing i thought of! Damn, those times.
---
I came here for the gone sexual and all I got was someone writing lots of words, that I’d wager have nothing to do with staysafe’s left arm......
---
I understood nothing when you got to the bags part but still a cool story :)
---
When a server is merged they are all merged to the same cluster so no guilds would be broken up like you are saying. Names might change or the guild might be disbanded, that's about it though. If they wanted to find their guild again there would be nothing stopping them. 
---
&gt;Holding off server mergers is very important 
---
The original servers were not merged for a VERY long time after release. You could use the logic that since this is a relaunch there will be a much larger influx of people at the start, regardless, having a server merge a year down the line instead of 8-9 months is negligible to me for the immersion a non instanced world brings.
---
are you high, lmao
---
Limit it to 1 hop per day, this still let's you join up with friends on other layers but limits abuse heavily.
---
This is the right answer
---
I really love the modern WoW graphics, but I also love vanilla graphics. Some people find charm in "old school" graphics.
---
As to why some people are against adding modern graphics if it only shows on your own game, then there are no logical argument. Well, a bit can be argued that they might have to spend time implementing it, thus either taking time from fixing broken things or meaning release would be later - but one the game release it would cause no harm to start working on it.
---
“This should be easy” is something you should never assume
---
&gt;You’re commenting on a post where a player gave an example they got shafted by layering in one day, and you’re saying most players will be ever experience it?
---
You are missing quite a few points here.
---
A) Beta is BETA for a reason. Its not there for people to enjoy their gaming, its there to test out different systems within the game and the game itself. The layer sizes in the beta can be REALLY small, just so they can see every variant of layering changes working and tested out.
---
B) If you are in a cave with a person, only reason why it would change the layer is that the current layer is at maximum capacity and they need to offload new groups to the next one. How often do you think this will happen in released game, when the layers actually hold a lot of people ?
---
C) I really dont care if one guy dies in a cave once. Im sure im gonna die in a cave. To layering, sudden spawns, ass pulling etc. Taking a comment like that, blowing it out of portion just to have any leg to stand on with your complaints... that something else. Like this thing completely DEFINES the whole game. 
---
If you dont like layering or sharding, you can always not play. Or wait for phase 2. No matter what is written in anywhere at this point isnt going to change how the game is setup. This is it. Now you can choose to play it or dont.
---
Ah yes, of course, because Blizzard secretly hates us and is doing everything they can do piss us off. Obviously.
---
Yea, that's a huge downer for me, so much hype crushed in one little video, I'm a need some input on this and how they will make sure shit like this never happens.
---
October 2020. 5hours a week, priest, speed normal. Seem realistically for me
---
Layers are intentional. In theory it keeps the server loads manageable but is like a shard for a while continent/instance of azeroth. Another player was on an "empty layer" and invited Ven, and he eventually was able to go from the fully populated layer to the deserted one by taking a group inv from the player on the empty layer.
---
Sylvanas isn't a night Elf
---
&gt; you toxic fuck
---
Lol, now anyone who is against layering is toxic? Go back to retail.
---
Yeah, and it doesn't have that weird leather bellycover shoehorned in to cater to SJW.
---
"I'd rather nobody can play than be minorly inconvenienced"
---
Cool
---
Even that doesn't work because people will fight on boats. They need to reappear in the same layer. Best solution is no layering. It may be the only solution.
---
I wonder if they're going to stress test AV for the next stress test...that would be insane.
---
no changes people on suicide watch
---
Tranq shot is a spell learned by Hunters, and the book drops (1 book) from Lucifron, the first boss of MC.  The second boss Magmadar, enrages and needs to be Tranq shotted, multiple times.  The Tranq Shot cool down is too long for only 1 hunter in the raid to have the ability.  You typically need 3 or 4.  You could get away with having 1 or none if you were super geared, but that would be hard considering your time table of 1 week and 1 raid lockout.
---
I'm not saying it can't be done, but I doubt it.
---
Well, actually you should have used the Drake Meme
---
How would you handle server caps and when to decide its time to merge?
---
The main issue between servers vs layers is that one is handled at the character creation the other at actually being online. Thus its a much more accurate way to measure the need.
---
That really isn't the art teams fault. They make what they are told to make. 
---
Making tons of unique sets of armor takes time and money. You are seeing generic armor getting recolored because Blizzard doesn't want to pay what it costs to get unique sets of armor. It has nothing to do with the art team being unable to come up fresh ideas for armor design or just being unwilling to put in the needed effort.
---
Layering has negatives for sure.  What that said, whats your solution to day one having 5 thousand people killing the same 10 boars?  You have to be realistic with the release and accept some drawbacks to get the servers up and running and people able to play the game.  They've already said the world will not be layered after phase 1, at least meet them halfway man.  If layering for a month or two will cause people to second guess playing classic, what do you think is going to happen when they can't get past level 2 the first time they play?
---
Guzu.  I find the one with around 300 viewers are the best non-toxic ones.
---
Yea but it’s too late, unless you want release pushed back the system is in too deep at this point.
---
That is the best solution IMO
---
Before cross servers, official wow forums server section was the place to be
---
*unique and unrepeatable experience*, you could say that about many inconveniences, and I don't get why inconveniences are something to strive for. Personally I want to be able to actually play the game and get *something* done, not just stand around struggling to tag mobs for hours.
---
Not entirely true. Some classic servers like Ely had higher quest exp from start to finish. 
---
Most only had higher quest exp after level 30. 
---
From what I’ve heard now the more popular ones have fixed these discrepancies.  If you’ve played on some of the more popular ones lately you won’t notice a difference.
---
Please report the issue on the official forums! We should mass upvote this to give it the maximum visibility, I can’t imagine how game breaker is would be if it it makes its way to release
---
I don't think the high elves look like that because they spend less time on them, I think it is because they were designed early on. If you compare to the original alpha (or was it pre-alpha? Can't remember) models of other classes they looked just as hideous. I think when they updated the races pre-launch they just didn't bother to also update high elves, as they were not playable and hardly in game.
---
I got a little enjoyment outta it in the stress test but no way in hell I'd do that on live servers forever.
---
I still don't know how this affects me as a casual player though. I totally understand what you're saying, and I see the big picture, but I just don't see how it will affect me. Can you please specify in what ways this will hinder my experience playing the game? I'm sorry for being like this, it must be annoying talking to me. Sorry. :/
---
the fact you are downvoted shows this sub truly has no idea how bad layering is. retail fanboys are now the majority here. RIP Classic
---
Gonna try and avoid buying shit on th ah until it's Needed this time around
---
I think you're getting your expansions confused. Viper Sting has no cool down in vanilla.
---
Also in cleanse wars you spam rank 1 which is 135 mana.
---
lol why are you stealthed? scared a GM will see you and think you're cheating?
---
I hate his model.   
---
So yeah, perfect fit
---
ofc!
---
Buying white swords and daggers for my warlock because they had bigger numbers, naming my toon my real name as I didn't know we could choose whatever we wanted, and selling everything I got from ore to greens to a vendor as I didn't know there was an auction house.
---
Add to that stormx for druid gameplay, kraun for mage.
---
Not even worth PvPing if we have to play with 250ms. I did it back in the day, but I won't do it again.
---
Sorry, this is unacceptable.
---
Just make 5x more servers. Earmark which servers will merge, and prevent duplicate names on THOSE servers only. Then down the line, merge, and you're done.
---
Layering is fucking this game up in an unimaginable way. It is actually at the point where private server experience is better than Classic with layering.
---
Azshara, desolace, ashenvale (horde pov) don‘t like them
---
&gt;  early on life tap is essenatial and more health is always nice.
---
Yeah that's a good point! Do you think improved Imp is worth having if I plan to group a lot (especially at early levels)? I only ask because demonic embrace doesn't provide as much stam as Blood Pact, and it also reduces spirit (and spirit is quite good when leveling).
---
Haven't we went over this a hundred times? Layering is absolutely necessary In the first stage, and it isn't a permanent feature. You guys like to complain about everything
---
at this rate classic is slowly becoming bfa
---
In classic i think it would
---
I'm against retail,you are toxic because you have the incel mindset that anyone who disagrees with you is the enemy. Go back to 4chan
---
I get it, this is twitch chat irony because incel gamers love boomers and everything about them.  That is why they love donald trump.
---
Slayering.
---
Node respawn rates can be dynamic as well, but this causes even bigger issues imo.
---
High elf then
---
 [HighWarlordStino](https://www.twitch.tv/highwarlordstino/videos/all) AKA PoonGoon is really good. Hes been playing a pvp shammy
---
They said first 1-2 weeks and then confirmed it wont be in phase 2 (because phase 2 is wpvp patch where ppl start ranking up). Then and there layering would be a baaad idea.
---
I dont see that as confirmation that layering is going to last the full phase 1. You might, but i dont.
---
New Blizzard's master is the shareholder, and costs are its greatest enemy.
---
If you think for a second they care about player experience then you're misguided. You are a dollar and nothing more.
---
Old Blizzard made player experience second to none and that's why they would we are all reverting to Classic now.
---
“So I was thinking about this” 
---
You should stop doing that.
---
&gt; The problem with 100 Servers now is, that the hype will die rather quickly and than you would have plenty dead servers within few months
---
You have no idea how fast or slowly the servers will die. All we have is past experience. And past experience says that blizzard rarely merges servers.
---
&gt;And a server merge is never an easy solution. Merged Servers are immersion killers. You walk by another guy with your same name? That other guy has a Server-Tag in its name? Or you need to change your name because of the merge? I prefer layering at the start of classic over merges 100%
---
What? Have you only played since they added sharding? This paragraph literally makes no sense. If you have the same name as someone when a server merges, the person on the server you are merging to gets to keep the name, the person transferring to the world is required to change it. It is physically impossible to walk by someone with the same name. This paragraph is arguing points that support less layering but the person is arguing he wants more, wut?
---
It will affect the market even if you can't hop layers at all.
---
10 layers is 10x mobs, nodes, herbs doesnt matter who gets them. Yes if one person gets monopoly on something sure but even with exploiting hopping it should spread among players enough. 
---
The issue still is, too many resources.
---
Exactly. Applying it to *the world* is the stupidest bullshit I've ever seen.
---
Allowing lvl 60 resources to be layered will be the death of Classic economy
---
It will be harder to get into the raid with rogue.  
---
But there will be less competition over gear with rogue.
---
There are high elf models in vanilla though? And they don't do the resting nelf female bounce.
---
the actual truth is that classic is just a tool to fund the shift to mobile development, anyone believing this is done in good faith is a tool.
---
Man all those people saying the DEFINITELY WON'T HAPPEN must feel pretty silly now.
---
They have sooo many bugs on classes and specs and game world to address.
---
And now they have to drop all that, and focus on layering?
---
Blizzard is fucking up royally by not just keeping it to lvl 1-5
---
I guess, but when it comes down to it I'd way rather watch the Warcraft movie again than the ending of GoT.
---
There are already 3-4 topics on layering today, so I won't make another one.
---
Blizzard needs to fix layering, ASAP. I have no hopes for layering to be discarded, it is going to be in Classic, this is why I am asking for a fix, not a removal.
---
I understand both the benefits and the downsides of layering, and overall, it is the least worst option for launch experience and population stability after launch.
---
HOWEVER, it seems that either layering CANNOT work without some form of sharding/phasing being added at certain times, either Blizzard is purposefully messing up layering, to come with an excuse for sharding later, because layering "is not working as intended".
---
Either way, layering must be fixed, or removed completely or replaced with sharding  for starter zones and for first week only.
---
Realm transfer and merges. I truly hate transfer and merges, but I rather have them one week into the game, instead of a layering system that is NOT working and it is highly abusable, and if it's working, it only does with additional small scale sharding/phasing.
---
**THIS SHIT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED ASAP.**
---
What class did you play grinding to R14? I thought it was a big note that the Alliance have a smaller population of locks, so can get geared quicker. Higher gear you can nuke before fear anyway.
---
This is tested *at the expense of* game glitches, class glitches, mob glitches, etc.
---
Layering is draining resources from other bug testing.
---
My whole leg is childhood video games so I just told both artists to make it look old and weathered
---
Dont care. Never used it in retail, will never use in classic.
---
told u 
---
fkn sheep didnt listen
---
The MBA part is tough, but strangely I find I could get more free time now (with wife, no kids) to play than back when I was single in college. I have a deal going with my wife where I'll do every god damn chore imaginable for the months leading up to launch and then nothing afterwards for a month or so. That house is going to be so damn clean on launch day.
---
That's not how layering works unfortunately. It's all zones or none.
---
How complex/tough is Hunter to play at a decently high level in PvP? I plan to focus mainly PvP. I don’t think I’m going to be in the top 1% of PvPers but I want to try and get into the top 10% at least. How tough is the Hunter micromanage? I’ve also toyed with Mage/Warlock/Priest as well. How tough are these by comparison?
---
Hope there are a lot of idiots like you - going to make farming that honor damn easy
---
I am hoping this is just beta old design as this is totally sharding, not layering.
---
why join a thread on layering discussion just to say "chill the fuck out"
---
there's always one guy like this in every thread. we're having a discussion about layering. if you don't like it, just leave. adding something useless and unproductive is pointless
---
RIP, this is it. WoW classic will be shite
---
\&gt;How would you handle server caps and when to decide its time to merge?
---
Queue times, and they would merge exactly like how it was done in Classic: rarely.
---
People were throwing fits in he BFA beta over things that never changed because blizzard didn’t give a shit. Hell, I reported a missing pvp talent months ago, had a GM confirm it was a bug, and they still never fixed it. I completely understand people not trusting blizzard to fix shit, and not accepting “its beta” as an excuse for things being broken.
---
Yes in Un’goro crater you can grind for a raptor. Sorry, can’t remember the name
---
Layering is for the entire continent, sharding is for smaller areas.
---
This is the best solution i have read so far. Kudos.
---
The good old days....
---
not only that, but Layering takes dev attention away from other important bugs.
---
Would this change much for warrior and druid combo
---
Your optimism in them changing it amazes me
---
Why would you wait three months to go look up what happened 8-10 years ago
---
It is amazing really. You make a product that is so shitty that your customers pay you extra to have less of it.
---
Clearly the answer is Deadwind Pass. Moonglade is a close second, on account of it actually having some quests that are turned in inside the zone.
---
Jokes aside, probably the Blasted Lands. There's just nothing to do there.
---
TBD
---
STV because of too many allys mostly. 
---
Otherwise i hate stonetalon mountains because of the layout, so much running for 1 or 2 qs only.
---
That's not how layering works. You can't have it based on zone. You are basically asking for sharding
---
Agree 110% with this. By far the best solution.
---
if you do it, be advised that you dont need to full prot while leveling if you keep your level a bit higher(1-3) then the average mob you can tank im arms/berserker stance and skills and just cleave till about lvl 50
---
i would suggest questing as a fast and solo solution and just do a dungeon a few times to get all the gear you want and maybe get 1-2 levels out of every new dungeon. see it as a alternative grind.
---
you will spend a lot of time searching for groups and waiting till everyone arrives. the xp in dungeons is not much and quests often require pre questchains and a lot of traveling.
---
that said if you like it do it
---
I can‘t, playing horde 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
You selected 'Not interested' for Arena Battles? WeirdChamp
---
This.
---
I don't want a BfA disaster repeated in Classic because of idiots saying "It's just beta"
---
I have yet to see a perfect solution. But some have suggested the need to be in a rested area for the layer jump to happen. This is far from perfect but it does make some sense RP-wise and can prevent some of the node farming/ wPvP and event abuse or at least make it harder to do.
---
That was added in later, it's not in Classic.
---
Layering bugs cause devs to stop fixing other bugs.
---
Layering *will* be exploited and destroy immersion in actual game.
---
If Blizzard truly valued the player experience they would remove it, but they are now a corp who cares about dollars more than player experience.
---
Well, that escalated quickly.
---
In vanilla you will be pigeonholed into holy. The other two specs are simply not viable.
---
For PvE purposes you'll be happy with warlock. Their damage doesn't come online until later but you'll be a highly desirable support before then. You self heals won't be very significant in raids, you'll want to mana tap to stay online and rely on your healers.
---
They level fast and you'll be keeping the class mount. Major downside is farming soul shards.
---
So what are you saying ? That those guys shouldnt get rewarded from their efforts or what ? First ppl clearing instances will have better gear, yeah. The guys that play will have more gold. True. They might run multiple chars and get double the loot to their mains. Essentially play more than you and getting rewarded from it.
---
Thats vanilla in a nutshell.
---
So what are you complaining again ?
---
Man does this bring back memories. During BC i was running BRD with a group that i found in trade chat. We were about an hour or so into the dungeon when the tank has to leave. And says he will be gone at most 10 mins. So obviously we are going to wait for him. In the down time everyone in the group starts chatting. I ask where everyone is from and to my surprise one of the people is from my city. Not only that but he goes to a rival highschool. We were both shocked by how small of a world it is. He was also friends with a familoy friend that went to his school that i knew. Just crazy how small azeroth could be sometimes.
---
I played a warrior. We did PVP before we even started raiding because honestly if you’re grinding to the top ranks you don’t have time for raiding. 
---
All 3 warlocks were human too.
---
LOL ok, have fun with thousands of people all the same starter zone fighting over the same 10 mobs.  Cmon man, be realistic.  Would you rather them open up triple the servers they need and have dead servers in a years time because you can't compromise for a few weeks of layering?  Stop with the arrggg layering bad, meh!  It's a temporary change that will lead to densely populated servers down the road.
---
Everyone knew this type of thing would be possible and it was discussed at length in the layering v. Sharding threads.
---
Some people refused to accept that this could happen, but no matter how you set up layering, it will.
---
People forgot what real achievements look like.
---
layering is being permanently disabled 3 or 4 weeks after classic WoW goes live.  any damage to the economy by exploiters, of which i've seen very little in beta (this clip is one of the only occurrences ive seen), would eventually resolve itself over time, and exploiters possibly banned to boot
---
Sharms still active with WoW songs these days.
---
Oh ok, I was thinking him trying to log out had something to do with it
---
I want No Changes classic experience. Not this vanilla wrapped in BFA Bull***t
---
Boxing as in dual boxing? I always thought you had to do the same class to dual box due to them getting out of sync due to ability differences.
---
To answer your question I’d say do the Hunter first 100 people route as Phase 1 doesn’t have much “End game” content and I think it’d be more satisfying to be in the top 100 than one of the first tanks as there won’t be too much other than getting pre-raid ready.
---
Asmongold.
---
I remember a time where raids would invite ANY druid they can find because they are desperate for the skill it brings to the table. So desperate, that you could be AFK and still get loot after the kill. You're gonna find a group thats fine with your situation. 40 mans aren't static, they usually have plenty of replacements in the waiting. Except some very specific classes. Among them, druids.
---
Hi! I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt, here, and assuming you mean well even though your reply comes across as fairly condescending. 
---
I know how to kite. Hunter main since 2007. Unfortunately at level 1-9 you lack some pretty important skills for kiting, namely Wing Clip. Even with Concussive Shot, you can't *always* kite something—at least not very far. If an attack of yours misses, especially Concussive but also Arcane Shot, the enemy can close the gap well before 1) they're dead and 2) Concussive is back off cooldown.
---
So yes, obviously you have to try kiting. The problem is that it's not always possible, and the reason is almost always due to your moves missing, so when something the same level as you gets to you, they're still at over 85% health and you're forced to melee them down (resulting in your death at some levels/vs. some creatures like spiders who can web you into place for long periods of time).
---
On the flip side, sometimes you can get lucky and crit on white hits or with Arcane Shot, enabling you to actually kill something before it gets to you. 
---
But my experience thus far has been: lucky to get anything below 60% before it gets to me due to so many attacks missing, and no ability to put distance between myself and my target due to lack of toolkit. I usually die in melee because my raptor strike misses multiple times in a row. You'd think this is just RNG but my God it's like every other pull. If I survive, it's oftentimes with less than 10 health. And these are things my level or a level lower: I straight up run from things one level higher because I can almost never survive.
---
Here's the gist of what I'm doing: I stay at the edge of range for autoshot and run in between shots, but as soon as the enemy isn't dazed anymore they're capable of catching up to my deadzone quickly. If I had an addon for a swing timer to track my autoshots better, maybe I'd do a little bit better, but I can't imagine it would make THAT big of a difference overall. I mean, I can't even *run from* mobs my level without dying. They just don't reset quickly enough!
---
Obviously with better gear (like some greens) I'd have an easier time, but in white quest gear it's just not that easy. Maybe it's just the follies of leveling in Teldrassil? 
---
If I'm doing something wrong, I am all ears. As night elves are...I guess. ;P
---
I hope they continue to divert developer attention *away* from bugs that exist in the world, to focus on bugs that exist in Layering, instead of just removing layering all-together /s
---
Or maybe a beta is meant for testing? They're likely intentionally breaking things to make sure there aren't issues when it's released.
---
Obviously he reason they would do this is so they can get away with less hardware devoted to classic.
---
what? lol getting to 400-430 defense was totally a thing, but I guess not in private servers lmao and no one is going to beable to do it in the beginning anyways thus making raiding mc a lot harder than it is on private servers and on top of classic wow bosses are actually not going to be completely broken and bugged like they are on pservers lol...
---
Reminds me of someone else's story (no idea who) where he saw a ret pally kicking some ass so he rolled one and got to lvl 40 before he realized he'd chosen warrior.
---
Really? I enjoyed Arathi. Farming elementals was a favorite past time of mine.
---
Like people escaping the intro in Skyrim before their hands are cut loose.
---
Are you doing it solo? Are you streaming everything or just the gameplay?
---
!remindme 80 days
---
I'm all for stopping at classic. But TBC was an awesome expansion. Outland was awesome. The Dungeons were awesome. The factions were awesome. Shattarah was awesome. I had a very good time in TBC.

&gt;bnet integration so if you have a friend on alliance already added you can talk with him in game
---
&gt;voice chat
---
what we getting next, blizzard? transmog and lfg?
---
Im joining u
---
Fix it very hard, very fast.
---
I didn't know they were layering the zones where you'd gather these?
---
I haven't subscribed to retail WoW in 5 years, and I'm not in the Beta so it's likely they don't care about my opinion. Only paying customers are able to have an opinion, even though I subscribed to retail for 9 years and played on 1.12 pservers since then.
---
This shit is gonna be the death for Classic as we used to know it back then.
---
Hi, /u/Buch
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c05jn0/asmongold_is_right_mcconnel_is_wrong_old_footage/). 
---
Maybe going back to Classic as an adult might change my outlook. As a kid I thought it was the least inspired zone.
---
DAE Retail players bad stupid lil zooms, Classic players smart and handsome gamer dads? XD
---
upboats to the left
---
Well im not one of those guys but one of the reasons besides nostalgie is that while they updates all those models they never did that with old armor and mounts (at least some like the AV mount) and they are against the idea too because they dont want to redesign sets people love and then disliking the new ones. So i can understand that people dont wanna play a bfa model with vanilla graphics armor sets.
---
Layering isn't going to help that much with day one issues.  Whether it's 5,000 people trying to kill boars, or merely 1,000, it's going to be an unplayable mess.
---
So is every NA wow player from Austin Texas or is it just random that almost all streamers are??
---
Don't worry guys.. they will fix it... it's only phase one... 
---
It's a necessity on launch.
---
It would take you an hour to finish some quests without layering and certain drop rates of quest items combined with the massive population in starting zones.
---
Have you read my post? You again did not explain how layering saves money. 2nd I stated that either someone has to change his name or there will be multiple chars with the same name.
---
Past expierience was something completely different. New Game with pop growth. This time it will be different and blizzard prepares for it.
---
That really fucked with me cause I only thought you added one zone, I couldn't wrap my head around where that green place was
---
Yeah I suppose that’s true.
---
Bruh I took that survey and I swear it was insane how many questions they asked.
---
Oh yeah! I remember that! There's a cave(?) south of wetlands that can be accessed through the IF airfield. If you aim right and slowfall-jump you can get into some water under the world and swim to old IF. Thanks for refreshing my memory!
---
UNNANOUNCED feature which may DESTROY CLASSIC
---
 A 10:07 YouTube video.
---
way more than half the playerbase will leave, and 5k would be insane with no layering. This is literally a terrible idea
---
That's the magic of everyone being on the same server, you run into the same people over and over again.
---
\&gt;All completely personal and nothing that actually changes the game for anyone else
---
\&gt;lists things that change the game for everyone else
---
Use some logic.
---
*minus the obvious pet pathing "bug".
---
If you dont want to be streamsniped then go to a pve server.
---
So I take it the weird scaling in Live now doesn't apply to classic
---
imo, make it so that you can only switch layers in capital cities. Then allow players to select which layer they want to be on.
---
Appreciate it, but the idea has been tossed around since layering was announced. Still a good idea, but not mine :)
---
Not classic, but WotLK launch day, rolling a DK. That damn needle quest.....took HOURS!!
---
The issue that I see with that prediction is the fact that Blizzard somehow made Layering worse while rolling out this new "upgrade". Why would they implement it if they have no plans to alter it for launch as we are seeing now? Did the update intentionally make Layering for the worse or was it intentional? Either way, this behavior should not be expected from a company like Blizzard.
---
yeah, I think there will be people who will stay up playing for maybe 72 hours straight but no one in their right mind is going to stay awake for 96+ hours to get to 60 and then try to clear mc, at that point it is a health risk.
---
That will be awesome when trying to join a friend's group.
---
Better than discord. So go for it.
---
Or they could just introduce grossly overestimated pop caps and then if needs be merge dead realms or offer free realm transfers just like back in the good old days?
---
You do know you'll NEVER have an even server regardless of streamers.
---
its a 2 week thing, only 1-2% of players will be 60, and even those wont have time to exploid it too much
---
Okay, well it will be interesting to see what they do with black lotus. Because they’ve really gone out of their way to ~~dick with~~ ‘recreate’ a true vanilla experience. So making lotus BoP till a stage 2 or 3 would fit with their ethos of a true experience. 
---
I distinctly remember tips out mentioning how lotus will not have dynamic respawns like the do on private servers because that didn’t arrive until burning crusade prepatch.
---
It's easier with the same class, but with practice you can two box two different classes with ease.
---
Exclusivity doesn't make a mount any less ugly.
---
In his defense most people are just yelling about how terrible layering is and it needs to be gone. An echo chamber of angry sentiment is hardly discussion.
---
Dev attention should be spent on *actual* gameplay bugs right now.
---
Suddenly, though, they have to drop everything and fix layering bugs?
---
Just abandon the system already its pure trash.
---
From my beta experience (stress tests), I'm pretty positive "layering" is actually creating multiple realms on the same server. It feels a hell of a lot like cross realm I'm BFA. I could by wrong but I'm pretty sure each layer is like a different realm.
---
Yes, but layering is to solve a long term problem (dead servers) and is temporary. I really dont see them keeping layering for a long period.
---
I’ll be stream sniping any alliance streamer I can. FOR THE HORDE.
---
Ps - sorry this means you to madseasonshow, as much as I like your videos.
---
Yeah, fuck them for testing shit out in a beta, right ?
---
Yes I do unterstand - that why I said I probably thought and spoke about it too Long.
---
We have made our voice be heard for a year about this. We are not happy, Blizzard knows that and due to that they now call it Phasing instead of Sharding. 
---
Thats literally all we could Change.
---
I just don't think it's neccessary anymore because they know we are unhappy and they DON'T CARE. It's Blizzard what do you expect.
---
They know - you can't Change it - they won't Change it...  Thats literally all I know for now...
---
I wish you big luck but I literally can't talk about this Topic anymore! I hope you succeed I don't want to drag you down :p
---
Just wanted to share my experience with this x.x GL HF
---
Pfft, you want a challenge do pet battling. The RNG is vicious there.
---
don't vanilla summons require three people?
---
Do you really think that is a realistic and better way to do it? Either you would have servers with insanely large queues the first few weeks or you would have several servers being "dead" within a week or two. 
---
The issue is that you will likely have quite a bit more than the current BFA player base making a character, but within weeks you would see a lot of players either quit entirely or at least barely play on the character.
---
Right? I love how that person is upvoted to top sub comment though.
---
It just shows you how many people die-hard support Blizzard and HATE anyone who opposes them, even if Blizz's idea is shit.
---
Batching
---
Engineering Target Dummies were lootable after they were destroyed in Vanilla.    Both the regular and advanced target dummies were lootable.  
---
This was one of the primary ways to generate fused wiring, a component in many higher level engineering recipes. 
---
In the Beta after dropping a target dummy, the target dummy is never lootable.   
---
This occurs is the dummy is destroyed by mobs or is destroyed due to the internal timer expiring.
---
Yeah, because that's what everyone wants to see, players vanishing in major cities!

---
Ugh. The evidence is piling up that layering won't be the elegant solution we were sold.
---
How much in server load savings will be cancelled out by millions of players constantly relogging, trying to exploit, or simply trying to get to where the PvP is happening.
---
It's looking like it'll cause more problems than it'll solve.  I'm starting to think just junk this whole broken system and launch it like real classic.  Queues and down-the-road realm merges be damned.
---
What's Orcish for "singleton realms or death"?
---
Bfa has sharding (per zone)
---
Classic has layering (whole world)
---
They said it will be removed asap - beta testers have been testing it.
---
It's now on blizzard to act and commit to only having layering in sub 20 zones (essentially bringing back sharding)
---
Yeah, because that's what everyone wants to see, players vanishing in major cities like SW and Org!
---
When i started in BC i did the exact same thing. Found the auction house for the first time and was blown away by how much shit there was. Ended up seeing something priced super cheap so i bought out the lot of them thinking i just hit a major score. Invest the majority of my Gold in Black Diamonds, because diamonds are more valuable than Gold...
---
TLDR: exaggerated worst case scenario.
---
Oh yeah it still does on classic beta, seen it on streams.
---
I also heard a good variation that was slightly less extreme: you have to be in an area that provides rested xp.
---
Why?  They could easily have 100 layers the first day per server.  50 the next.  25 the day after, etc.  They can do it however they want.  In the end their goal is to have largely populated servers with no layering, which is exactly what the community wants.  But leave it to wow player base to criticize everything with no solutions of their own.
---
It’s shows the cinematic
---
Darkmoon card is better in single target, but this might be better for cleave and will be in classic from p1! Good catch.
---
Gotta go fast!
---
They didn't summon until 2.0, the Pre -TBC patch.
---
They do, but maybe you could convince one of the other people to stick around at least for the summon? Good point anyway, would need to be considered.
---
Because it's not like they're already sitting on butt loads of liquid assets amirite?
---
Same
---
Pretty much the same as for the last few weeks it has been known. And the n posts on the subject we've been commenting on ...
---
Oh that’s right! I never did engineering but I am planning on doing it this time! How does the teleporter work? When you use it can you choose locations with other teleporters like a FP? Or does it correspond to only certain location such as Gadget-Everlook? Sorry if that’s confusing just wondering if you can pick teleporter locations. I don’t even know all of them, I only remember the Gadget, Everlook and Gnomer spots.
---
It's not possible to disable it.  That's how the client works - it's cloud based.   They're lying when they say that.
---
I agree, this does not seem possible.
---
I believe that he is actually the son of arthas and Jaina. They were romantically involved but after the fall of lorderon and arthas turn in order to keep her baby safe she turned to the wrynn family to hide and keep the child safe
---
Take the next day off and play all night. That's my plan, should cut back on some of the players without missing out
---
Most instances, actually.
---
Antidote at Kurzen's Camp.
---
Arathi was the main zone to level in from like 35-43 IIRC. There was plenty to do. Especially if you're skinning cause of all the raptors. It's a great zone for mining and herb as well. A lot of the 150-250 profession level stuff can be farmed there.
---
There are a few different camps like the boulderfist ogre camp that give plenty of loot too.
---
Definitely revisit it. It's wide open, but there is plenty there for sure.
---
Do you know what your total time to 60 was using that method?
---
Oh shit yeah they exist again in classic don't they. I rescind my statement. Well the one about stream sniping, not about asmoncreep.
---
Original Thread/10
---
It would behoove you to understand how it works before making a thread about how the sky will fall because you can't read the zillions of posts that explain how it works constantly.
---
It's almost like... People troll to spread misinformation.
---
hmmm.emoji
---
Server caps need to be more like 8k to be honest. 3k is not as huge as it seems, speaking from experience of both populations on private servers. Less players was worse in every way, and if you start dipping to 2-1k it is surprisingly noticeable
---
Pretty sure there's no better feeling in the world than a clean house.  Playing WoW classic in a clean house? hngggggg
---
Sounds like they blamed respawns on layer switches. Remember, half of the population have a below average IQ.
---
&gt;Some of us dont want the vanilla experience
---
And... goodbye. 👋
---
Or was it a lie...
---
Love that source. Guess it's only for people "paying attention".
---
If only there was some way for them to test things before releasing the game.
---
Some kind of closed environment, populated with testers to give feedback and spot bugs.
---
That was great!
---
Probably yes ...
---
As I can't ride my Spectral Tiger in Classic ...
---
A lot of people were never sold on that crap solution.
---
I ... actually like pet battles? Gives a use for all of those non combat pets.
---
Layering causes developers to fix layering bugs instead of, you know, actual gameplay bugs.
---
Layering destroys immersion, seeing people vanish in major cities, inns, middle of fights, etc. is *not* Classic-like.
---
Layering is exploitable and guilds that 60-rush will have three weeks to farm empty lvl 60 zones x10 layers per zone. Flasks *should* cost 100g will now be available to every guildie, allowing full MC clears immediately.
---
shall I continue
---
I found the drill sergeant.
---
TBH you probably didn't miss much
---
Well of course, in a perfect world that would be the case, but this is blizzard. We are going to see soon™
---
If you want everyone's thoughts, search "layering" and read one of the 9986349765943 other threads of people's thoughts on the subject.
---
If you want a DISCUSSION, offer a better solution to the issue (which, just for your FYI, is not only about a smooth launch -- in fact that's the secondary benefit of layering) and then we'll pick it apart and probably insult your character. ;)
---
It depends on your engineering specialization, which one you can get. Gadgetzan or Everlook (and in TBC you got one more in outlands each). It basically works like an additional hearthstone, but the destination is fixed. Oh, and it can go wrong and drop you off 100 meter above ground (or other stuff).
---
&gt;you again did not explain how layering saves money.
---
I have already told you, Customer service. How? Less people using it. In detail? I don't have blizzards finances in front of me so I can't list you the exact fucking amounts they save but I would assume less people using it would reduce the cost. How do we know the cost goes down? By what the developers have said in the past.
---
Just like making items tradable reduces CS costs. This is known. The devs have commented on this. This is not my opinion.
---
&gt;Past expierience was something completely different. New Game with pop growth. This time it will be different and blizzard prepares for it.
---
Blizzard always prepares for it, and most of the time they fail. We have had sharding for a long while now, have server queues gone away? No. They are reduced, but they are still there. Every launch there are queues.
---
I just don't get how you can argue for immersion and then be pro-layering?
---
I remember it to be a nice boost while leveling.
---
Good memory!
---
I filled out a survey prior to the first stress test and a few days later received an invite (stress test only). So maybe you'll get lucky for next week!
---
I’d say Stonetalon Mountains. The aesthetics just don’t do it for me
---
Hi, /u/Cancergame1025

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c05noi/can_we_consider_classic_dead_before_its_even/).
---
I remember as an alliance mage in Arathi Basin you could blink at a certain spot behind the house then air jump your way over the gates. You'd be able to start capping stables etc before the game started. 
---
This still wasn't patched in early TBC so I wonder how many people knew about it.
---
Because that's a terrible idea.
---
You say everything will be 4x the amount. But there will be 4x the Players playing on the Server than there was originally?! So where is the Problem here exactly?
---
Based schizo poster
---
Interested to hear how? If they "layer" only sub 20 zones - that's essentially sharding. 
---
Their only option is to have a timer - after 48 hours after launch - layering is removed. 
---
*That won't happen because it's 2019 and all the snowflakes need to be able to play that launch weekend so blizzard will keep it in.
---
If all you want to do is PVP and nothing else, just don't play classic since you won't enjoy it.
---
in a discord era this doesn't change much
---
#nochanges people are you OK?
---
What do you mean? I thought the beta was just for people to play the game and not actually test stuff? This subreddit told me the beta is the released game!!!
---
I remember spending hours upon hours in tanaris mining gold veins. I thought that in game gold was made from gold bars in the game. So my thought process was get as many gold bars as i could and turn it into in game gold. And i would be rich. After a few days of filling my bank and bags with gold. I unveiled my new get rich quick scheme to my friends and they told me it didn't work like that....
---
It is, sort of.
---
Each layer is meant to be a continuous whole-server instance.
---
So it's sort of like it's creating new realms, but as alternate-same-real, of the same name, not an actual distinct realm.
---
So it's like Defias Brotherhood-1, Defias Brotherhood-2 (if 1 is out of room), Defias Brotherhood 3 (if 1 and 2 are out of room), etc.
---
5k would be an absolute shitshow with no layering
---
Ill just drop this video here for anyone who want to see roughly how Paladin tanks function in a 5man.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALOPKT55wVQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALOPKT55wVQ) 
---
Because this is a private server I am utilizing sitting for extra damage on some pulls, but this wont work in Classic. Overall the impact will not be too severe. If mobs hit for less in Classic as we suspect then you can simply gear for less defense and get these crits regardless.
---
Imo after doing Palatanking for a while I can summarize the class to the following:
---
* No taunt means the group have to play around you somewhat. It's important you are the one to do the pull, and it's important that DPS hold damage for a couple of seconds until you can get some threat off. You can get around this by marking, say a caster mob, stunning it on pull and then let DPS deal with it while you build threat on the rest of the group.
---
* Having a mana bar instead of a ragebar means recovering from extra adds when mana is low can be difficult. Mana Potions will be your best friend. On the other hand, having a mana bar means you are free to frontload a bunch of threat on pull in the form of Consecration, Judgement, Holy Shield etc where a Warrior or Druid would typically be out of rage during the initial few seconds of the pull.
---
* Paladins being based on reflect damage means the overall damage contribution from a Pala is absolutely massive. It was not uncommon for me to be consistently top 1 DPS in a 5 man. This makes up for having to occasionally sit and drink between pulls.
---
* Paladins do take more damage than a Warrior. We have no defensive stance and our gear is typically less well itemized for tanking. You need offpieces to get your mitigation gear, and we also require spellpower which lower survivability even further. To offset this we have Blessing of Sanctuary which helps a lot in 5man, but wont really do much in raids as it only reduce the damage you take by a -flat amount. We also dont have Demo Shout/Roar like Warrior and Druid
---
* No Shield Wall or Last Stand to survive bad pulls. There's some ways around this and the more coordinated your group is the better. What is doable is using Bubble on yourself, getting a heal off, then cancelling the Bubble before the mobs reach the DPS. This is assuming either the healer or a ranged DPS is second on threat for most of the mobs. Having control of your own lay on hands also helps.
---
All in all, my conclusion is that Paladins are very viable 5man tanks for any dungeon including UBRS. It does take a little more effort to play than the other tanks but I find it very enjoyable and rewarding. My experience is also that Druids are generally faster to clear a dungeon with. Their utility and mobility is simply better due to having the ability to selfheal between pulls and Innervating the healer.
---
In no way do I find being a Paladin is a hindrance to 5man though. Just like a Warrior and a Druid they all have their unique strengths and weaknesses. For the most part, just having a tank be willing to come dungeons is more than enough for most groups and if you perform well and you learn the class inside and out you will be very welcome in any 5man group.
---
Thorns before pull. Moonfire one. Barkskin+hurricane. Swap into bear and hope they die before you do. That's how druids did DME lasher farming.
---
Goblin Sappers and Immolation Oil are handy as well.
---
As was mentioned in my post. I'm not repeating myself. I explained why I think using those wouldn't be preferable.
---
They can only turn it off if population drops in a big way, else more realms or sharding forever, tbh flawed design from the start.
---
I hate this layer thing, jesus... wow just went downhill since this. 
---
Im all ready mad D:
---
Sorry but isn't this not the reason at all? I was under the impression its for server merging issues and hyper inflated server pops due to 'wow tourists'.
---
IF server caps are 3k, you're still looking at 500 people in each starting zone. I don't think mob tagging is an issue tbh, its a temporary inconvenience and its actually really cool to see that many people in game.
---
The point is, many of the new people on this sub defend Blizzard to death and because these people don't understand Classic immersion and Classic's economy, they have no idea how bad layering is.
---
&gt;we need player interaction and lots of it.
---
You think you'll be solo or something? Come on..
---
Shame you got to wait till near lvl 60 to get it. I will yes.
---
It's like 4x the playerbase on 1 Server.
---
BUT THERE WILL BE 4x THE AMOUNT OF MATS AND STUFF..
---
Doesn't that equate to the exact same amount we had originally? :O
---
Layering needs to be gone after level 10 period.
---
Oh you mean on global servers that had 3 different prime times? Nice comparison.
---
You can use both you know!
---
I think ill play hunter and offspec attempt this kind of bullshit, seems like so much fun to kill people with a bunch of procs.
---
No, you don't have to continue as I'm also against layering, just like many (probably the majority) of others here and we all know the downsides of it.
---
I disagree they are preferable, there is no horde elf race either. We are going in circles so best to agree to disagree.
---
I think you're right.
---
&gt; you would have several servers being "dead" within a week or two. 
---
If you think a WoW classic server ~~would~~  can die in two weeks you are insanely fucking deluded and I don't think it's even possible to have an intelligent conversation with you.
---
It is exactly how retail sharing works. Layering is a larger scale server of sharding, that is all.
---
I played until WotLK and have done some pservers. I say gratz whenever I see someone get the flash.
---
It’s quite alright, these economies aren’t totally typical due to the nature of resources and farming in video games. I actually wrote a paper on the economy in BLack Desert when I was in college. it focused on the need for taxes and gold sinks to draw currency out of the economy. 
---
The exploitation of layers and shards will unpredictably warp the economy making it hard for you to both compete with hardcore players and/or pay for the things you want such as mounts and crafting materials 
---
If I’m using layering to farm 5x as much ore as another player I can  drive the price of that ore because I am both putting more on the AH and denying those resources to be farmed by others across all shards/layers. Principles of scarcity and cartels
---
As far as low level gear if the are 5k people on a server across many layers there will be so much gear say under level 40 on the AH it won’t sell for very much so it may need to be vendored by most players because abundance will drive the price down so low it’s not worth the deposit to auction. Which can interfere with players who are behind the curve in leveling from making gold at a reasonable pace.
---
I really enjoy these conversations it’s only annoying with people in bars who think economic policy doesn’t affect them. That being said a player in a game doesn’t exactly need to participate in the economy but the inability to Will be detrimental to their experience
---
I know this, I'm just saying this guy said he played on one for 2 years... which isn't true.
---
Solution - more servers then merge the ones which have less population in a few months after release 
---
Reality- costs too much in the eyes of the stakeholders
---
I guess it really doesn’t matter how I explain it, Reddit’s reading comprehension is 3rd grade level eh?
---
Wasn't really meant to be condescending, just thought it weird that you find it that hard because my experience leads to vastly difference results - so it kind of seemed like you didn't actually try to kite properly.
---
&gt; If I had an addon for a swing timer to track my autoshots better
---
I do sometimes use a swing timer, so maybe it does make a huge difference, but I also have no problem without it. Might be my timing is quite good (I kind of see it as a rhythm, and my rhythm is quite solid).
---
I just can't believe you are actually doing as you describe and only get a mob down to 60% before they enter the deadzone. I get them way below that. Maybe you need to change your weapon upgrade path? And I also *always* level my hunters as NE, so it isn't about the zone. Or maybe you overestimate your own ability to time auto shots? No offense, meant, but it really sounds like you do something wrong, and you describe the same tactic as I use, so it must be something like timing or weapons.
---
Without miss I can practically kill a mob (sometimes need a raptor strike). Miss chance is also only 5%, so it shouldn't really be *that* big of a deal.
---
i think they have the same %hit you have I think. But, 
---
1st: i might be wrong 
---
2nd things can be different now
---
That's awesome.
---
3k players in each layer, and its based on the whole world, not a specific zone. The reason is that servers will have 5x the population on launch than they will in 6 months. Without this, Blizzard has to choose between unplayably overpopulated servers on launch, or dead servers in 6 months. With layering, they can avoid both
---
That only works for arena chests that always spawn in the same spot.
---
There's no way to tether herb spawns and other spawns that have respawned on one layer, to the one that hasn't been picked and despawned on the other layer. It's just too messy. Simpler to remove layering.
---
They’ve been working on this game since spring 2016. It releases in two months. Its almost the end, not the beginning. They better get on it.
---
Next time, open up a microsoft word file, write all this in that, then close without saving and go to bed.
---
Did the grind in BC when the rep gains got a buff.
---
Still enough for me, probably not going to do it this time around.
---
There are only two options to not affect the economy terribly. 
---
- Layer only up to a certain level (too much effort, they won't do it)
---
 - After a set amount of time after launch (48 - 72) hours disable layering and merge (won't happen because "everyone" needs to be able to log in the first week.
---
So from blizzards side of things - they will ONLY go as far as promising that layering will be removed after the first week... nothing shorter - and even that's a long shot since population will still be high.
---
People playing pp
---
You don't think we will get updated visuals ever? Even within whatever type of new content they may add in the future? That would be disappointing because I want the bfa graphics in the gameplay of classic. Still super excited to play classic though don't get me wrong!
---
You need therapy
---
good goyim
---
Just wait til you're in the clump of 80 guys trying to loot the three, 2 minute item spawns in dun morough
---
they should fuse them
---
It's actually going to be 5 times less messy, using your example. Maths are hard.
---
personally I'd rather not sit in a queue for 10 hours and deal with the minimal impact layering will have
---
This is a really cool story. Cant wait for more experiences like this when classic releases.
---
&gt; literally can't play tho
---
That's literally not true tho
---
I never suggested they layer sub 20 zones. Layering sub 20 zones would be worse than keeping layering in for two months. Who wants to hit level 20 and walk into a world with 10,000 levelers?
---
&gt; We were told an alliance raid was in ratchet and when we went no alliance.
---
This is literally the worst part of layering and its driving me insane that we don't have a stickied issue on it and its not brought up daily.
---
Kind of a bummer none of the streamers are fighting against it either
---
You do understand that layering is NOT intended to address overpopulation at launch, right? It's main intent is to try to control server imbalances after tons of people leave the game.
---
I got into the Beta... never got a survey... I feel left out. Where is my survey invite Blizzard?
---
Warrior as a second char is the way to go imho. Having the funding for good weapons and decent armour is huge!
---
verbal shart to go with that order of shard...
---
was skeptical of the idea....But after reading that answer, this looks amazing !
---
Like a server merge? Wow, if only we had something like that now...
---
I think the chest is the Zandalar chest from ZG. Having had this chest on my druid it looks a lot like it. And would make sense because it is an all around good chest.
---
I'll have you know this is in flagrant violation of *dozens* of maritime treaties! The Booty Bay Boatmaker's Union will hear of this!
---
Can someone explain what’s happening ???? Where did that guy appear from
---
The arena is another thing which is why Classic is far better than TBC.
---
Arena ruined TBC as did flying mounts.
---
No, your dmg will never be solid. You might do 200-300 dps in nax gear, while other dps will be around 800-1000.
---
That's fine - as long as you accept other people would rather have queues "locked layers"
---
wait?  
---
I thought shadowpriest arent allowed to use SW:Pain duo limited buffslots?
---
Thank you for making the post. This is the whole argument right here.
---
As far as priests go anything non-dwarf is kinda on more or less equal footing.
---
Thanks for the detailed reply mate. You just convinced me to stick with giving prot paladin go in classic.
---
More realms, problem solved, layering is community cancer.
---
Being someone of a technology background i am aware of how said layering works thank you.
---
Frown.emoji
---
Exactly my point - they won't do that, for the same reason they will keep layering in past a month - they are expecting players to drop off and I don't believe it will have a 80% dropoff likenpeoppe are thinking.
---
It surely is, for the Samophlange quest line completion. And you need 5 of those blasted things.
---
Again though, how does that impact a casual player at all?  Once they get to high level they’ll have cheaper flasks, ok.  As they’re leveling, they don’t need to but level 1-59 items.  So far the impact only sounds positive for casuals.
---
Maybe but I won't be in a hurry. It'll probably be a "I really don't feel like doing anything but farming gold" thing for me where I grind it out slowly. Human should make it a bit easier, but fug that darnassus rep.
---
It's not any different than people exploiting changing layers to exploit spawns and aoe farm for world firsts. Or by changing layers to farm Devilsaur Leather, Black Lotus, Mining nodes etc
---
If you think it will only be in starter zones you don't know how any of this works
---
If i play 168 hours a week I'll ding 60 in 2 weeks!
---
You're joking right? That clip of the female streamer rage quitting classic and going back to retail that was popular a few days ago was entirely driven by them corpse camping her.
---
Tirisfal is actually a really good starting zone though. Silverpine is one of the best imo.
---
"Let's group up and quest together"
---
"Oh wait, we're on different layers, I need to run 20 minutes to the nearest inn so we can sync up"
---
&gt;reddit
---
I played a lot of korean MMO's (hello Aion people!) And they always had "layering", but they call it *Channels*. A new Channel opens up automatically when a certain area reaches a threshold of people that are zoned in it, its not something instant too, it would take a couple minutes for a new channel to be created, and after that, you could change channel freely with a cooldown of 5 minutes iirc.
---
I'm not saying WoW should follow the rule, but layering is something that is not new, and they should find the best solution for Classic WoW, even if that comes with a negative side (once you login you are allocated to a zone and you cannot ever change it, even if that means you wont quest with your friends for example)
---
This is rubbish. I played a human rogue and an orc warrior and orc lock back in the day  and was stun locked or stun locking orcs all the time. 25 or even 40% success still means 75 or 60% chance of failure. Hardiness is a great racial, but it wasn’t enough to imbalance the factions back then and if people feel that they will own pvp as a result of it they will most likely be disappointed. Top end pvp back then wasn’t about ranking. It was about good players that knew how to play. Rank meant squat because there were no arena tiers.
---
8k is too much in my opinion, you have to remember those servers are not region locked.  
---
Those servers also do various hack-fixes to respawns etc.  
---
Finally I'm personally on the nochanges camp (far as core game-play and community goes, I obviously do not mind tech / stability / exploit prevention)  
---
In any case that's a side discussion :)  
---
The layering discussion doesn't change much by shifting the server caps up or down.
---
They won't destroy the economy, they'll just make it to where they have control over the market :)
---
I don't get what you mean by "locked layers"
---
Depends on what you mean by worst. Subjectively least favorite? Westfall. I've lost so many alts because of that zone just sucking the fun right out of them. It used to be okay, but I think I've just run through it so many times I can't stomach it anymore.
---
I'm really over people defending Asmon by "iT'S jUsT a ChAraCteR111". No, dude, he's in a character 10% of the time and within those 10% he throws his worst behaviour and pretends it's not him "for real". Not saying it doesn't work - look at his numbers.
---
Classic is dead before it's even released.. good god Blizzard sucks balls.
---
In presenting themselves as the saviors of ghost town servers we will instead have a few 5000queue servers with destroyed economies and every nolifers who are going to be on flasks 24/7, sounds real fun
---
&gt; Even within whatever type of new content they may add in the future?
---
Big assumption.
---
Inns would be fine as well imo
---
Yea it's done. Better pack it up. No need to visit the Classic WoW forums anymore or make any more posts about it.
---
Your ignorance speaks for itself
---
Not really useful for any other type of game.
---
Send them nudes, it’s the only way.
---
I doubt it, but I'm just a random bloke on the internet. What the fuck do I know?
---
You can only switch layers in a rested area. Problem solved.
---
You know "no lifer guilds" will rush past you and there's no way you'll ever be able to compete with them no matter what, right? Stop screeching about it and play the damn game.
---
Something similar happened on the BC free server I’m playing on.  My friend was leveling with this random guy and they chatted about mains.  Later on (we are a new guild) my friend gets ready to join our Kara run and I’m helping our new OT get enchanted and def capped.  Turns out it was the same guy
---
I took economics in high school many years ago, and so I could be totally wrong but ill try to do a dumbed down version. 
---
Wow's economy is like any real life economy - prices are determined by supply and demand. With the way layering will work, low level items that you are more likely to be trading in will be at a lower price than we are used to, because with layering there will be less competition at first for farming them. Fighting over resources with X amount of people in a zone is much more difficult than fighting a tenth of that amount of people because they've been split into 10 layers. This means more supply, meaning lower prices. This will lower your income as you will make less money on these commodities.
---
As phases progress, and no lifers get there first, they can manipulate the market. Your no life guild has farmed the flask and devilsaur mats for a month and gotten a massive head start on both production of flasks as well as collection of mats? GG, they can start putting mats on the AH little by little at inflated prices because they hold the lion's share. Your guild, and some of the less casual players you play with, now have less disposable income, meaning they have less gold to lend to low-level guildies, but also less time to help lower level guildies farm or gear up etc. as they will need to compensate their lower income because, despite their lower income, the cost of their raiding necessities has gone up. 
---
 TL:DR, how does this affect you? you will make less money as you level, and your less casual friends will need more money at the end-game, but will have less means of making money, and so will be less prepared to help you when and if you need it. 
---
I could be way off the mark though, just my interpretation of what's been said. As I said, I am certainly not an economist!
---
Bamboozled!
---
I would drop the while vw ordeal and lvl with imp. He pumps some serious dmg out while He has mana :p but for vw DE is great
---
It won’t hinder your experience as a casual player.  If you aren’t trying to play the AH, buy gear off of the AH, super-boost rather than grind out your professions, or hit world firsts, literally none of this matters to you.  It’s just people screaming about the end of the world.
---
It’s called layshardering
---
Casters used flasks because it's required to be competitive on the meters. The lotus prices are actually more expensive than they were in Vanilla. Even if prices went up another 30-40g most people would still buy them it just means 1 extra hour of farming for a huge huge boost to spell power.
---
true story
---
Ion Hazzikostas strikes again. Quoted as saying something like "if you don't like the gear, just use transmog". Dude doesn't get it. People want to earn cool looking stuff and show it off. Warfront gear in BFA looks cool though so at least there's that?
---
Dude fuck the haters and raid as enhance!
---
Arena is what helped WoW grow to where it is today. Theres no reason to hate on Arena at all. It was a great addition to TBC.
---
Flying mounts I could live without.
---
Not on my priest main. On something that can kill things better, probably.
---
Server merges come with its own set of issues. Why not advocate fixing layering so its not exploitable? It's a fine solution. I mean... layering basically is server merging... it just is built in server merging.
---
This needs more traction
---
I havent read the wall of text but iirc they said that layering will only be active in the first 2 weeks or so. After that it will be inactive so thos "exploiting materials" etc. will be not be a problem.
---
Didn’t they comment that in an instance like that it’s not working as intended?
---
I only found 1 boe epic in Vanilla. It was a Skullflame Sheild and it dropped from an ogre in deadwind.
---
I really thought this was going to turn into him keeping the 10 slot bags you gave him on the rogue instead of giving them back to your hunter.  Surprisingly wholesome!
---
Was like 18 days played as a rogue to 55, then did cauldron runs to 60 in wpl
---
If you're going to pvp, Orc. Always Orc if it is a choice. That goes for every class. 
---
If you're not then whatever you want really. I'd probably still go Orc even if I wasn't PvPing, prefer the animations to troll and Tauren.
---
Were there any questions on it about Layering in classic. If so, what were they? If not, I hope you left a comment about it.
---
Everything has a flaw. Beta is for beta testing. Do you think the alternative levelling experience is better than layering? Trust me, after playing a pserver with 20k online you're gonna be begging for it
---
If its not changed since, you need to be subbed to post on the forums, which I am not, and won't be until classic releases. I want their high end data analytics tools to see that Cancergame1025 subbed only for Classic.
---
If people are complaining on the official forums good for us, but Blizz dosen't look like a bunch of people who are going to compromise on layering sadly...
---
Always thought it was weird she was an UD NE in the old days.
---
Indeed. As much as we wanted Vanilla back, we wanted a community feeling back. layering and sharding ruins that experience.
---
Gotta be mad about something!
---
Haha I hear ya.
---
Oh, we KNOW how bad layering is.
---
But we also KNOW that any other option is WORSE.
---
Dynamic respwans? Yeah, let's fuck up the economy and have Mages and Locks leveling at lightning speed.
---
Fire up more realms? Are you fucking kidding me? Blizzard no longer merges realms, so we will end up with A LOT of dead realms OR connected realms.
---
20k+ people per realm, with 3k playing and 17k waiting in 2-3 hour long queues?
---
I mean, if you are able to say that layering is bad...surely you are able to come with A BETTER OPTION...right?
---
So, let's have it, shall we?
---
It is, or maybe a dream? You decide.
---
Yes, one day your black lotus is worth 10g, the next day you log in to see its now 100g piece
---
Raging and shitstorming because of the rage...(and the shitstorm)
---
It would, people are just too stupid to understand that the economy won't be fucked, if anything resources might be slightly cheaper than they should be for a month. 
---
Layering or no layering, big nerds are going to rush 60 and powerfarm devilsaur leather and lotus. That was always going to happen.
---
Because where do they put the wall that swaps between layered and not layered even if they do have the tech for that? People will abuse phasing in and out into and out of the arena layer to drop combat etc.
---
That's very different. One is an online only game by virtue of the fact that it's an MMORPG. Diablo had no reason to require being online short of DRM, and that is what got people so fired up.
---
I can't recall complaining on the same scale back then, plus Blizzard gave us game time. I didn't even see most of the crashes myself, though I still have the game time on my account history. 
---
So yeah, invalid comparison.
---
That functionality just won’t be built into the game given than if you’re already in a city or inn, logging out is a trivial additional step for the player.
---
Orc
---
Me neither. Of course people will drop, but I think a lot less than blizzard is anticipating. Leaving us with server populations that could destroy certain aspects of the game once the server does collapse
---
Apparently the #NoLayering brigade got together last night and decided to flash mob reddit with the same post over and over. Good strategy................................................................
---
Never under estimate the unbelievable level of stupidity in people.

Not an official guild shirt, but here is me in my Death Knight shirt in my favourite village in azeroth

---
I mean, the whole thing is nothing but live to win on repeat. If anything ever deserves to be muted by the system, this is the one.
---
You are so naive...
---
Cuz the bulk amount of players camping mobs at launch is the best part LOl
---
I won't pretend like I played vanilla, but common opinion is that even top guilds in vanilla didn't utilize flasks all that often (probably because of farm time). So it would stand to reason that the process would be lower of no one is buying.
---
Is that a shaman spell?
---
All good, don't see it mentioned on here because people just rather demand one way or the other.
---
Ion said the idea is - once you join a server you are "assigned" a layer. The only way to change a layer from there is by being invited to a group by someone on a different layer.
---
If they truly want to NOT affect economies and communities as much, they will put a hard cap on layers and treat them like the mini servers they are. 
---
ie. If I'm in a layer and my homeboy invited me to a group - 1 of 2 things happend
---
 - Their layer is "full" and I get a queue to join that layer (won't happen because everyone needs everything right now)
---
- Once you change a layer you can not change a layer for a set amount of time. (1 he should do the trick, maybe even something like 4 since people will be playing for a long time)
---
If it wasn’t layering it would be something else. Haters guna hate. 
---
Personally I’m looking forward to classic and don’t think layering will be that big of an issue, especially by the time the game is released
---
It has to be like this. Anon’s all over the world
---
I understand it's *easier* on servers with fixed populations to get to know people, form a reputation, etc...
---
I'm just saying that if you're playing live and feel alone but refuse to even add people as a friend, that's kind of on you.
---
Because layering is a server wide technology. It makes a virtual server when the pops get too high and shifts people into it. Sharding is what you want, which is breaking down the zones into their own virtual servers but they already said they aren't implementing it.
---
I wonder if this is better than just actually having a ton of realms then merging later.
---
My favorite thing about these new maps people are doing, is no-one is saying 60+ zones. Hitting the leveling zones is absolutely what adds value to Classic. I'd be fine adding a 60 dungeon in them, but additional world leveling content would be incredible.
---
because it takes only 1 week for a group of hardcore players to completely fuck with the server economy while abusing layering and farming whatever in the world in double, even triple
---
How is that different from any other time?
---
The exploiting shit is the least important part and I’m hardly concerned about it, especially as I’ll be poopsocking the first two weeks taking advantage of it. It’s the post collapse issues people seemingly are ignoring
---
Yeah, your solution is a lot better for the communities /s
---
&gt; Yeah, fuck them for testing shit out in a beta, right ? 
---
Ermm...no.
---
I did also said that this might be for testing purposes. Have you even read all my comment? Or you just snapped after first paragraph?
---
you should hop layers so you can get faster spawns
---
&gt;Considering that the pvp rewards will be in their updated 1.12 state 
---
Who said that? I really doubt that's happening
---
I cant commit more of a crime against gnomes any more than what they have done to themselves.

Theres only a couple gnomes i even like at all. Millhouse, chromie, addie.

And chromie isnt even a gnome, millhouse is a baddie(ish), addie is neutral. 
---
To steal a joke from some youtuber. They can invent machine gun, planes, mechsuits. But they cant invent themselves into relevence.
---
Live in Austin TX myself and headed to Galveston for July 4! Cool story !
---
Absolutely.
---
Not the beginning of the game, I mean the beginning of the additions or "fixes" they will be doing
---
Imagine linking or explaining it instead of being a dipshit. We would all be surprised then.
---
&gt;Blizzard
---
Do you mean Activision?
---
Judging by all the changes ive seen we are not getting the authentic experience.
---
"Actvision WoWClassic Plus™" right now is pretty much bfa with vanilla models.
---
Even private servers are looking better right now, so yea, if Blizz doesnt get their shit together we can say that the game has a high chance of being Dead on Arrival. Very sad ! indeed
---
I do too.
---
The celestial tournament is something that really challenges you and resourcefulness
---
\&gt; Jesus christ quit yer knighting for someone who 99% probably doesn't give two fucks 
---
This could be applied to almost anything these days.
---
It needs to be fast. 3 months isnt long for testing. You really think they will test and change the game 1 day before launch? They also need to come up with another solution. Layering will obviously break the game when you can jump between layers and farm herbs/ores/rare spawns/devilsaurs etc. 
---
This is the same attitude when people raise concerns on alpha “easy, its just alpha”, then they find it in beta “come on, its just beta”, then when it is released on live “it will be fixed in a future patch, give them a break”.
---
I hear warrior and paladin are great together
---
I don't plan to participate in auction houses at all though. So that's why I don't understand how it will affect me. I plan to gather all the gold I get via farming, which is how I did even back in the day. I never had any issues with it taking a lot of time. I'm a casual, I did say it.  
---
I know real life is vastly different, and in real life I do participate in discussions like this seriously, but in a game where I don't plan to compete with anyone, and just play together with my guild, going through content at our own pace, getting items, gear, and gold at our own pace, I don't see why the AH would influence me or the guild.  
---
I can see for example that if a group would always stick to killing a quest mob, or farming an area constantly out of a certain profession's material, that's a problem, but that's a problem with 10 servers, 1 server, layers or no layers. If a group dedicates their time to resource-block others, no shard or number of servers or whatever can save you from that. 
---
If I only make gold via quests and farming monsters, selling gear that I pick up, and never bother using the AH, never plan on competing with anyone, and just play at my own pace, does a number of people exploiting shard-I mean layering really affect me that much? I still don't feel like it would.  
---
I know there will be jerks in the game, there always crop up, but that would happen with or without layering. I don't plan to speedlevel, I know people will be clearing endgame content, and running around in BiS gear before I even ding 20 or 30, and that doesn't bother me at all. It would happen either way, layering or not...layering maybe will make it happen faster, and ruin the economy, which....I understand is bad, and I'm sorry for everyone participating in the big game, I hope and wish that somehow things will sort out for you.  
---
Tell me what am I missing? Why am I not seeing that this problem affects me in the game?... :/
---
You can skill it to thunder shit storm.
---
what needs to age? all this information is available today!
---
I'd argue that it's the other way around. Beta is like an Ice cream cone on a hot day. When you first get your hands on it, it's amazing nothing could be better. But as time creeps on and on. It melts more and more and is far less enjoyable. Meaning It would have been amazing to have beta in the first week or shit in the first 3 weeks. But now if i were to get beta i don't even think i would play. The closer it gets to launch the less appealing beta is. Especially if the shut it down before the launch of classic, to build up the hype for the launch. Personally i don't have a lifestyle where i could no life it on the beta and get to 40 in a week. It would take me close to a month to 1.5 months. So by that time the beta might be closed and i would have to just do the grind all over again. No thanks on that one.
---
i keep thinking about what the best solution would be and this has to be it. Just make a ton of server with a normal population on them so layering isnt necessary and if/when the time comes, you can merge servers.
---
Can they just confirm Aussie servers already? Jesus Christ.
---
Which is why I've been asking the past couple of weeks why nobody is hard requesting Blizzard announce their plans after layering is removed?
---
All I got in response was
---
- we'll cross that bridge when we get there
---
- people will leave the game
---
- there will be queues
---
- free transfers
---
Not that simple - take a streamer server for example, once layering is merged we'll have a supposed "vanillla" server pop of 2-4k at any given time.
---
Streamer servers will have twice that logging into 1 server the entire time they are live... so that server either has 10 hour queues or they get the option to transfer to a dead server...

I'm going Priest, Holy at the end for healing. I've played as a Hunter and Paladin in vanilla raiding before, but this time I want to be a more versatile healer.
---
This seems like it could just as easily be exploited. If Venruki just logged out and then logged into a different layer it would have had the same effect as it did in the clip. Hell, now that players have even *more* control over the layering they could hop around to each layer getting the same chest/node/etc over and over again. Have friends in each layer guarding the chest/node/etc and the player could just hop layers and not have to make any other effort.
---
Doesn't seem well enough thought out.
---
Did this to man. Was a lot more fun with friends back in the day. We would all race to 19,29,39,49 And once there pvp while the other caught up. Then do a few days of straight pvp with the 5 of us. And then all start leveling again.
---
This is a beta, with a small community, where the dude that invited Venruki just forsake the chest to the streamer for no real reason other than he is a streamer.
---
If Blizz is truthful about their layering intentions, I'm not worried.
---
Soon Vanilla will be released again, we need the reborn of thizzz masterpiece
---
Blizzard will never make people wait 1-4 hours to group up with their friends. I would argue that would make the game even *less* authentic than the current layering.
---
I don't even see how your first option solves anything at all
---
You can let Blizz know by not playing classic when it comes out.  We don’t need you.
---
sincerely, 
---
everyone who would like to enjoy the game without having bullshit, evidence-lacking complaints crammed down our throats every 5 minutes.
---
I guess you've missed the last decade where beta is 90% a marketing gimmick now and 99% of what happens in a beta is there on release and well after?
---
Layering will help casuals WAY more than hardcore players. The hardcore players will be ahead of the curve so layering won't help them level faster, there won't be able mob competition/wpvp in their rush to 60 either way.
---
All the casuals will level [number of layers] times faster. 
---
Hardcore players who hit 60 first will be powerfarming high value resources either way. They'll have less time to gather as much as possible before the wave of casuals hits 60 and starts competing with them.
---
I see...I hope that this whole ordeal won't ruin the experience of the game for them. :/
---
He also takes disturbing pride in it too.
---
Haha...Arena 100% was terrible and ruined TBC.
---
The weapons you got from Arena were the best pre-raid and mandatory to get for PVE. 
---
TBC killed world PVP by adding flying and Arena.
---
Are you serious??
---
I don't trust Blizzard to stick by that rule.
---
It gives ten servers a 10k population on launch instead of giving twenty servers a 5k starting population. If 70% of players quit you'd have ten servers with 3k pop instead of twenty servers with 1.5k pop.
---
Getting ganked by a stream sniping gang once in a while is such a small price to pay of having a huge group funneling whatever gold, items, and help you could ever need. Oh, and don’t forget enough to live off more than comfortably.
---
I think for worst it has to be a quest that you are sent to, and fully expect to continue to level at, only to find it's clearly inferior to another.
---
Silverpine Forest.
---
&gt; Tell everyone who wants to play with their friends, but chose to level on a different layer, to fuck off.
---
"just tell your customers to fuck off lol"
---
If they only keep layering around for the few weeks, then they might just ignore it. The exploits at low level for this are fairly minor.
---
Stop wasting time and just buy gold.
---
Fuck ‘EM.  If they’re getting all bent out of shape over pixels instead of enjoying the experience then that’s on them and I’ll be glad not to be grouped with people like that.
---
So she did it because otherwise other humans would have tried to exile/kill Arthas' offspring? That's actually a good theory.
---
That's not very nice. But maybe I am deluded then. If blizzard planned on having 3k per layer max then it would be likely they wouldn't want more than 5-6k or maybe 8k per server if they didn't use layers. So within the first few hours that server would be full, however when 60-80% stopped playing at that server or classic all together they wouldn't delete the characters but you would be stuck with a server with an active population way below what blizzard wanted for the game to feel "right".   
---
Is that really not a thing you could imagine happening? 
---
Unless of course you have a server cap at 30k more like what they would have with layers, but only allowing 3k to be online at the same time in the first several weeks. Boy that queue time would be insane. Imagine DC'ing or needing to leave for 20 mins and now you can't play on that server for the rest of the day.
---
weren't the zeppelins in at the start of vanilla?
---
Ele looks more fun to me, but yeah, fuck the haters
---
I think the big issue is that blizzard cant be trusted to remove it. Or not to sneakily use it in the future and say it was a bug.  Or not to use it for aq gates.
---
Thats true, but he also suggests to not worry about it until August ... thats basically the release date in terms of dev time
---
How can you fail to understand "hosting more servers" is not a thing. Every realm runs on the same server infrastructure. Having 1000000000000 realms costs exactly the same as running 10 realms. If we're talking about the realms just existing. It's not 2004, realms are not separate servers.
---
Rule #7 INC
---
It’d save 1000g that would be spent on an epic mount. The fact that most people won’t go for it makes it pretty tempting to do as well.
---
Phase 2 should not happen so late after phase 1.
---
1) Real world patching: Initial wow release in the US was november 2004, however we start classic already with patch 1.2, which was december 2004. Patch 1.3, which is phase 2, was released in march 2005, so three months after patch 1.2 and a mere 4 weeks after EU release. Phase 2 also contains patch 1.4, which was released a month after patch 1.3. PHase 3 contains the patches 1.5 and 1.6, which were released two respectively three mnoths after patch 1.4.
---
2) Phase 2 contains Dire Maul, a critical dungeon for gearing up for raids as well for several lvl 60 class quests.
---
3) Phase 2 contains the honor system, a critical component of making pvp worthwhile. PVP players will clamour for phase 2 very quickly.
---
Those three reasons make a phase 2 release in late october, early november very likely. Definitely december at the latest. Expecting phase 1 to last longer than it did as retail is delusional. They'll likely slow down the phase 3 release a bit, but phase 2 is so basic and integral, it should not take very long. To be perfectly honest, I'm surprised, they didn't include it right from the start, but then again I'm an EU player, so by the time I reached 60, patch 1.3 was already out.
---
Dude you're not listening. He is simply telling you that you're using the wrong terminology. Phasing and Sharding are similar but happen for different reasons. If the game world has not changed then characters are not disappearing because of Phasing tech but rather disappearing because of Sharding tech
---
Not judging you or anything but you have the same stance as everyone else 1-2 months of a beta before any expansion release, forum posts informing Blizzard of the problem.
---
Two weeks to release people say "Don't worry guys Blizz won't let this content be in the fully released thing on launch!
---
Launch day:  Guys it's the first day let Blizz get their stuff sorted it won't last more than a week.
---
Blizz: It's only stage 1 of Classic which happens to be several months.
---
If anyone was expecting more or something different than this, I would like to ask what made you think anything would be different this time?
---
It’s so god damn annoying.
---
I want to be a healer(priest) at level 60.
---
Thing is I'm a big noob and I have dumb questions.
---
1. Can I level up my character as a holy priest? 
---
2. How good is holy priest as a solo player?
---
3. What activities I can do in endgame(max level) other than raids? 
---
Can't be sure if I find a guild/play active enough for raids. Is the holy priest even a good choice then?
---
Enjoy fighting 3 times the people with the tidal charm trinket 👍
---
I honestly do not understand how 95% of the gaming community suddenly lived life on voice chat via discord.  It used to be more common for people to be inconvenienced by getting on ventrilo, and would only open it up for BG's and raids.
---
Now you join a guild and it's like, "join discord!", listen to us yammer, wear a headset, be social!
---
wtf.
---
To preface this I don't really do any pve at max level, just while levelling up.
---
I played a rogue in vanilla and was quite good at it, got a fairly high PvP rank And really enjoyed the class. I'm torn between going rogue again and going druid for some variety. In PvP I see it as:
---
Rogues have a stun, a slow, a spell interupt, but no self healing or slow escapes
---
Druids (feral) don't really have a stun, don't have a short cooldown spell interupt like kick, and don't have a slow at all. They do howerver have self healing and escapes from slows.
---
Am I wrong there? Rogues have a lot more utility in combat with slows and interupts and stuns, but druids have more utility in general and their cat form will never be as good as a rogue. Not being able to reliably spell interupt and in particular not being able to slow enemies seems awful
---
Any thoughts on warstomp synergy with shaman? Does that have any merit worth consideration?
---
The thinderbluff zeppelin was added in cata
---
Depends on your gear. I would start with Ulda and go up from there.
---
Keep preaching the gospel.. maybe we will get thru to blizzard.
---
They’ve created this whole world and the most of us (poor bfa beginners) had a blast in the last 15y. I’m totally trusting blizzard in creating a game that gives you nice experiences that they’ve already created before.
---
And that's how the game works for a 3 year timeline but eventually all good things must end.
---
This is such a trivial problem to get worked up about.
---
Won’t ruin my experience.
---
Yep, just expand how many servers need unique names. I mean how many players will be playing classic anyhow? Sure, maybe a lot, but not as many as trying to make a new character on any popular rpg nowadays that's been out for more than a year
---
Bud, I’m about as caught up on the culture war as it gets, but what is the connection between Sylvanas armour and SJWs? (Legit wondering, I mean her model sucks but I don’t think we can blame literally every bad thing on SJWs... This is like Star Wars TLJ, it’s a bad movie with or without Holdo’s hair.)
---
Because it sucks - easy to abuse and breaks immersion - and "ASAP" may mean all the way to Phase 2, i.e. months.
---
&gt; Two weeks later you’re playing on a server that has 21,000 players. Instead of fighting for quest mobs against 500-1000 players, you’re now fighting 10,000 players. This absolutely cannot happen.
---
Chances are, the majority of those 10K people quit. Of the remaining, some will be much higher level and some much lower level.
---
&gt;you again did not explain how layering saves money.  
---
&gt;I have already told you, Customer service. How? Less people using it. In detail? I don't have blizzards finances in front of me so I can't list you the exact fucking amounts they save but I would assume less people using it would reduce the cost.
---
Ticket count is related to the number of people playing. Whether it's on 2 physical servers or 2 virtual ones, makes no difference from customer support point of view (as long as the number of players is the same). If you have any examples on how it would, please share.
---
Yeah I'll keep an eye on what's happening and make a post with updates.
---
It sucks ATM. You know the Game is still in beta right? It’s all testing...
---
Do you have a link?
---
Fix this shit man. Seriously Blizzard cmon. You’ve been doing so well with Classic don’t let this be the one thing that can ruin it and piss everyone off. Fix this!!
---
How does upsetting us save money homie?
---
I would if I was Alliance
---
Have you heard?
---
Great work! Keep it up. Your efforts are appreciated.
---
That's the whole point of doing it.
---
If something is not a challenge why even do it?
---
Tbh were gonna be bored in classic at end game and those “chores” give you something to do — a reason to be out in the world where you find pvp skirmishes and meet people. A really enjoyable expierence if you ask me. Whereas other classes might log on and not know what to do we always have something to do if we want
---
more because nothing interesting happens while leveling anymore. grinding out two rounds of three quests (kill/collect/boss) in generic questhub xyz with your only limitation being how many mobs you can pull at once vs having an adventure where you try to figure out the best way to get across the zone to get your quests done and making meaningful decisions about what to do.
---
I just found Swifty the other day.  That dude always has such a great attitude.  10/10 would recommend.
---
Arena is responsible for the shitty nerfs to fun abilities and precisely why they were all pruned out. All so precious esports players could have a "fair" fight. Ruined PVE.
---
Asmongold the superior douchelord guessed something right? Raise the flag and fill the balloons everybody, it’s party time!
---
Yes that must be it... to think it would be a completely normal reaction to a company that OPENLY stated they wanted to recreate their game as close to the real classic wow as possible and then give us the old switcharoo and introduce this... thing.... is completely stupid and probably comes from a group of people who don't even want to play classic anyway
---
Worst case scenario would be massive numbers of people join 1 or 2 servers and those servers need permanent layering to avoid miserable open world gameplay.
---
Really depends on your spec/gear.
---
Saw a Video once with a dude having T2 gear and going Sub. He actually did Lava runs in BRD alone. Gotta say though, its not so effective as you have to kill quite some trash and gonna be tricky with kiting/LoS.
---
Yes, I have a few visual arrow bugs once the screen width goes below a certain size. Pretty hard to figure out and so I just left it haha
---
To be fair, there's been a ton of complaints about the new character models being to far "off" from the old ones.
---
This video is sponsored by Squarespace...
---
Boomers? as in baby boomers? Aka the generation born from the baby boom after WW2? How old do you think boomers are?
---
Paladin buffs are statistically better, but they don't have similar impact. It's like killing someone with a pistol, or killing someone with a rocket launcher. Both do the same thing, one is just far more efficient while the other is much more cool and feel better.
---
Do you expect Classic to pull in Vanilla style numbers and growth?
---
I'll just buy it on the Classic Store™
---
Well, if I'm selling items to the vendor, those prices never change, and the rest I keep and share with my guild, never planning to use the AH. In real life, the market affects me because I can't avoid it. However, in WoW I can easily play and complete all the content in the game without ever touching the AH or be affected by the market.  
---
Okay, maybe not easily, but casually, over time.  
---
Also, unlike in the real world, resources respawn endlessly in game, so as long as there's a timeframe and a spot where they aren't constantly farming and I can get my hands on the resources I need, I will never need to spend a bronze in the AH at all.  
---
The point is, if my guild will make and gather all the mats for ourselves, craft everything we need for ourselves, and get money only via vendoring items(giving greens and blues to our local enchanter instead of vendoring them or putting them in the AH), then the market won't affect me at all.  
---
That's how I see it, and that's the mentality of the guild I'm in too. AH prices won't affect how much vendors pay for items, nor does it affect drop rates from endlessly respawning resources(be it nodes or mobs).
---
I agree that they are testing things out... but I also believe they do not have a completed plan in place for after the testing goes.  And will be trying to figure out how to handle layering bugs 1 day before release just like they do with every expansion in retail.
---
Discord is also a good replacement to website/forums. But that's the text part of it.
---

---
As if blizz didn't do any layering tests. So sad and naive. They know how it works, but like any other shitty company, they always hope that no one finds out or bothers saying anything until it's too late.
---
Maybe it's cause I play on RP servers but I see the same people day in and day out.
---
Completely normal reactions don’t all happen one after another after another all morning at random.  This is a coordinated effort which makes no sense because we have no power to change it.  This isn’t Blizzard it’s Reddit.
---
I like how people still think this even after Blizz has said multiple times that Activision has no impact on their game development.
---
IMO they need to rethink the entire release strategy
---
* Phase 1 (Classic Launch): Molten Core, Onyxia, Maraudon
---
* Phase 2: Dire Maul, Azuregos, Kazzak
---
Say you're not playing 8+ hours a day, one major difference between classic wow and vanilla, it took a *while* before you were being wrecked by a Hand of Ragnaros, now it might happen before you ding 60.
---
As much as I've been cautiously optimistic that Blizzard will implement this as effectively as possible, this is disheartening. There needs to be a time and location limit to switching layers. You should only be able to switch layers every so often and you should only be able to switch layers in certain locations.
---
It wouldn't solve every problem, but it would help.
---
Fake News. The radiation in Gnomeregan isn’t so bad. My calculations say it’s only 3.6 Roentgen.
---
Limiting it to 1-5 wouldn't really do anything, it's like 30 minutes of gameplay max. Unfortunately I think it'd at least have to be 1-20, just because Barrens is the biggest problem zone when it comes to initial launches.
---
It is but it doesn't out weigh Orc stun resist.
---
You know that blizz has said their going to get rid of layering a few months into phase 1. The purpose behind it is to handle to amount of players on release.
---
At least if you are competing for ressources in a non layered zone you get to pvp then out of the map... on layering you will just see people phase out when you approach them..
---
Cheers. Who did the one above it?
---
I don't think Blizzard need to fix this, it's a trivial problem to have while waiting for phasing to be removed. Somebody being given the chest by a friend who could have just looted it themselves is not going to damage your gaming experience.
---
So the best business plan is to spend millions developing classic and then piss off the people who would play it and make them not play it?
---
Glad you're not working for Blizzard.
---
... it prevents layer hopping.
---
I love how people are okay with the necessary evil that is sharding/layering but as soon as a queue time is involved they immediately flip a switch.
---
Because lines at Disney world don't exist - and they don't do "4 hour windows" for thousands of dollars or anything.
---
But hey if $15 entitles you to play immediately and not have to wait then I know exactly the type of person you are... the one that complains if maintenance gets pushed back a few hours and then DEMANDS free game time to compensate you for not being able to play.
---
K
---
Does asmongold have his own subreddit? Because this seems more like something you should post there and not on /r/classicwow
---
&gt; Why "and fast"? They are in beta that is only up to 40 - the game doesn't release for 3 months.
---
Development takes a lot of time
---
  "Let me enlighten you. " 
---
There is were you lost me, went from a guy with a potentially valid opinion to an i\*iot who is talking down to us.
---
We get layering, get over it.
---
&gt; I cannot see why layering is reducing the need for customer service at all.
---
Just because you can't understand something does not mean it doesn't exist. 
---
&gt; how does layering reduce customer service needs? 
---
They reduce server merges which reduce server costs and CS issues (name issues, item issues, character deletions, etc). There are just less things that can happen when you don't have to migrate an entire server of people over. 
---
You might think sharding/layering would create its own issues, and it does, but less than it solves. 
---
Again this is all based on what devs have said on the forums. 
---
&gt; sharding was never introduced to get rid of queues by the way. Sharding was introduced because you have ques for everything and thats why the world is dead. Sharding is working against that. 
---
I never said it was, that is just a main issue. Additionally, sharding was not introduced "because you have ques for everything". They made it so you could tag mobs and still get credit so why would you need your own instance?
---
They made sharding specifically so they could have bigger/less servers, or at least spread the load out better. 
---
&gt; Not everything blizzard does is because of money 
---
Literally everything Blizzard does is for money. That is what a corporation is. Welcome to capitalism.
---
i like the cut of your jib, but the layout of this zone feels way too organized and BFA-like. Vanilla zones had a theme and overall structure and it wasn't about balance or giving both sides equal footing in the zone
---
There’s already so many out there, ClassicCast and Countdown to Classic being the more popular ones.
---
&gt; Bare in mind people aiming for this, it takes about 120 hours of grinding to achieve.
---
That's more or less the time you spend in 4 month as a DD waiting on the LFD queue in retail.
---
And after 4 month whatever you farmed in the dungeon will have been replaced. The tiger, on the other side, is forever. Doesn't sound too bad.
---
This is how it works. Its how it is designed. Its how it has worked since the end of WOTLK and its how it works in BfA. Theres no ‘fix’ for it. It needs to go. Thats the only fix.
---
Everyone is going to say Asmongold but honestly I think he's hilarious and can be really entertaining to watch. Don't just believe the groupthink of the sub- try his streams yourself and see if you like it or not. He also is usually playing with Esfand, another streamer who is very chill and much more low-key than Asmon.
---
In a simulated environment like a game, manufactured inconveniences are what give it any sort of purpose or achievement. I'm not necessarily saying a buggy launch experience has to be a part of that, but striving for convenience is what killed retail. The ultimate convenience is logging in to a "you win" banner, and not having to do anything. Actually, logging in is inconvenient...maybe they could just email the banner...
---
What I'm trying to say is, overcoming the inconveniences is what makes a game FUN
---
Oh it will... you just arent aware of it yet.
---
Thats hardly more than a lung scan!
---
For sure, because they are releasing a game where everything is already common sense. You can’t change that. Even a lot of addons will ruin the „Flair“ if you’re going to use them.
---
What is the solution then?
---
My solution would be that blizzard locks people in layers once they switch the first time - lock for an hour or 2 or 4.
---
Hardiness isn’t guaranteed to work when you need it. Trinket is on demand.
---
Warstomp has a cast time and a cool down but can be clutch. Your toon size is probably most relevant when you’re healing. In general pvp people while be tab targeting so your size matters less. The hit box thing was ‘t something most players were even aware of back then so if things are similar then it will be a non issue. This may be a glitch in the beta build.
---
Anyway, imo if you’re going enhance orc&gt;Tauren &gt;troll.....ele -orc&gt;troll&gt;tauren ....Resto-orc&gt;troll&gt;tauren .
---
Some races have more advantages then others but there were a lot of terrible players with ideal builds and disadvantaged builds that played great.
---
With a heart of the wild spec you can tank dungeons and heal raids, just by swapping gear. Unless you're looking to join a hardcore guild you'll be fine
---
No, it won’t.  Don’t care that much.
---
By flooding the market with otherwise rare items it would significantly alter the economy. While you can claim that is or isn't 'destroying' it, it does make a significant impact when compared to the vanilla economy people are hoping for. Extend that possibly through out phase one and you do have a significant shift that would not recover.
---
Excuse my long post (I was terrible).
---
I created a Mage and played it all the way until 60. I never tried another class because I didn't want to start again after doing the initial quests. I didn't understand much about the difference between the classes and when I did figure it all out I decided just to stick with my Mage despite not liking it. I've since learned I love playing support and heavily armoured classes in role playing games so the Mage wasn't a good match.
---
I didn't use or know about any addons or macro's. I was a clicker (no keybinds) all the way through until WOTLK so I was painfully slow in terms of mobility and executing my rotation (another term I knew nothing about).
---
I never used the auction house to sell anything, I vendor-ed everything... materials, rares and anything I couldn't personally use. Meaning... I was literally flat broke all the time! I never had any gold to buy anything at all, someone gave my gold for my level 40 mount but I never got close to an epic one.
---
I didn't do dungeons beyond a couple someone in my guild invited me to whilst I was leveling. He was a priest who (I didn't appreciate it at the time) did try and help me a few times. I remember he invited me to ZF when I was in my mid 40's. He asked me to create a portal so we didn't need to fly home. I asked him what a portal was because I had managed to get all the way to something like level 44 without realising I had access to portals. He didn't take the piss, he just explained how it worked and I was amazed by the convenience!
---
By the time I hit level 60 I was in full greens (some random junk I mostly got from the AH cheap, due to the fact I had no gold).
---
I loved the PVP, fighting at Tarren Mill was epic. Unfortunately I thought you had to repair your gear after dieing in PVP (just like PVE). To combat this I had a set of vendor purchased white gear (just chest and pants) for PVP. I PVP'd with no stats! I thought I was saving gold!
---
I read somewhere that it washed the reason. That they'll have this activated for the start and then remove it from completely
---
They're not just going to have the servers that start up on launch day, they'll eventually open fresh severs too.
---
Ok that does make sense but why would blizzard make sharding for saving money in customer support when they have to sacrifice paying players for it. 
---
And to the other guy. I never argued pro sharding. In my opinion its just stupid to think layering is for saving money.
---
Agreed
---
&gt; It’d save 1000g that would be spent on an epic mount.
---
That just doubles the time spent grinding for the tiger. You'll be a lot faster grinding for the epic mount first, then grind for the tiger with your epic mount.
---
if i'm out grinding mobs can i hop layers to make them all respawn faster?

I think the constant popping in and out and being unable to find your friend are bugs. I could be wrong! Layering is SUPPOSED to be more stable (as opposed to sharding). Like, mini-servers within a larger server that you are jumping around less frequently....... at least that's how I understand it. These mini-servers will slowly be merged as more and more people quit the game after launch.

Weren’t a lot of server firsts on private servers actually smoking crack?

Blizzard started that in original WoW, less than 20% of players made it past level 20.
---
For Classic WoW, a ton of BFA players are getting it for free. A ton of players will just check it out and then quit.
---
When nobody else has the piles of money to buy their excess of booty they won't really be helping themselves much. Supply and demand and all that, too much supply and the prices tank.
---
I very much like this idea. It should be easy to implement and would avoid wpvp, gathering, rare mob exploits etc.

All that being said I plan to play Warlock and my Bro is playing Warrior which isn't a god tier combo but it will do for leveling. I think what makes a good combo is most likely heal/dps combo since the healer can prevent some unwanted downtime etc.

New models would be better overall imo, but there are a few that i would hate to see updated. For example, the old worgens are so much better than the new ones.
---
So listening to that, I got less that "BFA is going to be great" and more "Classic is not going to be great". And as much as people are going crazy about Classic online - don't count the chickens before they hatch. BFA isn't great but people are playing BFA. One year from now will Classic players be a sizable portion of the WoW community, or will they be a small niche?
---
People on this sub that think that Classic WoW is going to maintain 6+ million subs are deluded. It's almost as close to insanity as I can imagine. I would be very surprised if at the year mark you have more than 1 million people playing Classic. More realistically... maybe 250,000 actively playing Classic (actively as in meaningfully engaging in end-game systems). 
---
Right now, /r/classicwow has 130k subs and /r/wow has 1 million subs. You would think that the scales would be more tipped if there was a silent majority of millions waiting to engage Classic in a sustained meaningful way.
---
Lol I love people like you - we are what sub 11 weeks away, but don't worry guys - blizzard doesn't have their stable launch version yet...
---
The only bigger douchr is McConnell. Seriously, I can get used to Asmongold... But McConnell always being on his channel ruins it completely for me.

Tauren
---
Because that would require them to change the entire game to accommodate a different population than the game was designed for.
---
They want the game to be authentic and unaltered so layering is a way to get around that. Each layer is an authentic unaltered realm.

I've got an amazing solution for you. Don't play it. Stand up for your principles! Believe in something!!!
---
Weapons from arena weren't the best pre-raid for all classes and definitely not 'Mandatory'
---
In the end, PVE gear ruled arena anyways.
---
Who said it was? I’m replying to a comment that says “no one is complaining about the art”. Well, there’s an artistic element in BFA that is seriously lacking. I’m not saying the artists don’t have the ability to do better, I have no idea where you got that from.
---
The fact that they're downvoted shows that this sub doesn't value letting the conversation devolve into meaningless insults toward Blizzard and the community.
---
imo it’s not layering that will „destroy“ the economy, it’s the hardcore players. And if they group up to sprint to 60 and endgame they will. With or without layering.
---
Why not search for vids of shadow raiding in yt? See for yourself.
---
Layer hopping ruins the game much less than not being able to group up with whoever you want. You're a delusional moron. Enjoy
---
lol no...50/80g is just for one of hte materials to make a flask.  Flasks are 100-150g.

Shadow priests are trash in PvE. Why do you want to play one so badly?
---
Items have the same stats as they did in 1.12 in Classic, all of them.
---
There is a site that will translate horde and alliance and you can just make a macro. Of course not everything can be translated. Certain letters just do not exist.
---
More like Asmongold 0, McConnell -1
---
I read his comment as an agreement to your statement. You know, sarcastically saying “Fuck them for doing what they are supposed to do.”
---
But maybe I’m being optimistic, who knows?
---
Ok snowflake.
---
Have fun with your first time in vanilla.
---
I did the same thing. Wife and I owned 3 ferrets. Within 2 years, they all passed away from cancer. At the time, I found torchlight 2 and they allowed a companion. Must have been fate because they had a ferret to choose from. I combined all their names and they remain my buddies.
---
Even without layering they’re going to flood it with shit.  Doesn’t matter in the slightest.
---
Don't stick your dick in crazy
---
First of all: One "shadow" priest (basically shadow weaving, also available as holy priest ...) is usefull for the raid. But ... only later and only if you have some locks. Shadows dont get into the raid because of their damage, its about buffing others in combination with the bit damage you do.
---
About your Rotation ... SW:P is not a Thing since debuff Slots are limited. Iirc Mind blast is also only good if you can sustain the mana. On real Long fights, its better to channel mindflay as the dmg/mana Ratio is best for that one.
---
Your damage will ALWAYS be on the last part of recount. Even if you have T2+ gear and consumables and Play good ... a fury without consumables and pre raid bis will outdamage you. Dont expect to go high in pve, you will prolly not reach over 1k DPS even in naxx.
---
Shadows are beasts in pvp though.
---
because they won't remove it ASAP.
---
You misunderstand, when I put fix with quotes surrounding it, I meant it in a humorous way. Regardless, yes it's dumb but I don't think they will just do away with it at this point. Best thing we can do until they decide to remove it, if they do, is just deal with it and work around it.
---
If 80 people of one guild farm the best spot ingame due to that mechanic they can flood the economy
---
Somebody I don't know or care about is smarter than someone else I don't know or care about. More at 11!
---
If you start grinding it on 50 I think you hit 60 just grinding and will still be revered. That's 840 turnins, 8400 items, like 20000 kills (not sure what the droprate is).
---
Someone please do the rest of maths.
---
&gt; ok, have fun with thousands of people all the same starter zone fighting over the same 10 mobs
---
That is not what layering is trying to solve anyway
---
Follow your own advice
---
100,000+ people watched a group do deadmines... definitely won't have a server die in 2 weeks
---
Why are you still posting and reading the sub if it will be a guaranteed failure? For hate?
---
Everyone’s collectively shitting on you but why? This applies to nobody here. Ok, put a cap on 48 hours played straight. Who should care besides the meth smoking tryhards?
---
Nope that's sharding and doesn't solve the population issue after level 5.
---
This isn't a solution, just a waste of a topic.
---
Refund.
---
24th January 2020, thought it would be in January.
---
Says...you?
---
Yeah why are people raising concerns when it's only a beta? What's the point of that? People are silly, providing feedback for a beta? Ha ha so dumb.
---
Can't really blame Blizzard for not knowing Durotar and Orgrimmar are part of the same continent.
---
You clearly didn't play during early-mid tbc lmao
---
Can someone explain to me why layering is a thing in the first place?
---
Like why wasn't it there in the past why is it here now?
---
You can do several bosses in BRD with decent gear: Pyromancer Loregrain, Lord Incendius and Plugger Spazzring.
---
Exactly , so stop acting like a child.
---
I plan on going feral druid so i would say nothing. Red will equal dead. And if it doesn't i'll just run away like a bitch. #druidlife.
---
Yeah about that. The only thing they brought in from modern WoW is on track to be a deal breaker, it's been what? 3 weeks and it still looks like they've got no clue. 
---
This all started with "to that end, we believe some form of sharding will be necessary in the starting zones".
---
What is rule 2, and why are you reading this thread backwards?
---
Someone please explain to me why layers are needed beyond starting zone.
---
Only the best fast, and I mean fast, fastest fixes will be accepted as far as fixes go. Fast.
---
What do you mean about quality of life?
---
Chain pulling is super appealing!!!
---
I liked the WOTLK model the best out of all of them. Little bit lower res, but closer to her WC3 model and the art I had seen of her. BFA one looks more like the BFA cinematic.
---
I suppose it is fine if its there. Never using it.
---
During the stress test I got a few bad experiences with layering. The first one was during the zepplin ride from org to undercity. We were a bunch of people on the zepplin chatting and once we zoned into Tirisfal  everyone disappeared which was annoying since I was having fun. 
---
Next was in Elwynn Forest and I was being chased by a bunch of allies. When I crossed the border to redrige, they disappeared aswell and I was free to go back to Goldshire. 
---
I dont know what needs to be done or changed but hopefully they'll have it sorted out.
---
&gt;  phase 2 release in late october, early november very likely 
---
Haha. Okay, man. I don't really know how to respond, but I'll try. You genuinely believe they're going to release Dire Maul and honor *2 months* after launch? Your post isn't going to age well. 
---
1. When 1.2 released in 2004 has absolutely nothing to do with the Classic cycle. We're not "starting" Classic with 1.2 just because Maura is in, we're starting with 1.12 and Blizz are manually staggering content. Honor wasn't even originally introduced until a month after DM. It's meaningless. It's not 2004 any more and the cycle 
---
2. It's not even remotely critical. There's a handful of BiS that you absolutely do not need to do MC/Ony/BWL. Dire Maul was a catch-up dungeon and is being introduced as such. What's the point in having a catch up dungeon when the majority of players aren't even max level yet?
---
3. Yes, they will clamor for it. I'm well aware. The phase 2 begging on this sub and the classic forums is going to be legendarily retarded when the nolifers have MC on farm within a month. It *doesn't matter*.
---
&gt; I'm surprised, they didn't include it right from the start
---
I'm not surprised you're not surprised. They made it explicitly clear why they're staggering it *over three months ago*. Here, I'll even repost it:
---
&gt; Some of the loot that’s attainable from Dire Maul is so good that it would affect progression through those early raids. We’re also planning to hold off on releasing Kazzak and Azuregos at launch as well, for the same reasons. 
---
If you're expecting a phase 2 release before 2020 you need to seriously temper your expectations.
---
Not being in the Beta, I have no idea what the problem is. Please detail more on the situation you are having with layering? I really want to know what I’m looking forward to when classic drops.
---
...so sharding gives them money how?
---
Do you have any idea how much damage 10 layers for a couple of months can do to a server? You would have 10x the amount of Black Lotus, rare spawns, Broken Tooth pets, Devilsaurs etc for several months. Yeah, I don't see any problems with that. What could go wrong. People are so silly. Raising concerns in a beta, ha ha so dumb.
---
Their "seamless" system sure has a lot of seams.
---
You can call it whatever you want.
---
If something is bad, people should be able to dislike the bad thing without *having to* understand it. It shouldn't be mandatory. It doesn't matter if we're talking about layering or anything at all in the entire world.
---
If you feel something is a bad thing, you should seriously be fucking allowed to dislike it, whether someone call it being ignorant or not.
---
I can relate to the clicking part played that way till mid tbc, as mage also, fun times
---
What a childish response that is never going to happen. Layering exists for server stability in phase 1 when you've got loads of people playing.
---
I'd much prefer this
---
Not sure why you're getting downvoted, you could absolutely mount on top of the box on ships back in vanilla. Unsure if it was patched out before TBC though. The video below is at least post 1.7 because the paladin has Hammer of Wrath on his bars and at most 1.11 based on upload date.
---
https://youtu.be/UuS_pglZwmI?t=12
---
Blasted Lands, Azshara, much of Winterspring, there were a few zones that definitely seemed unfinished.
---
One zone that I think was finished but I thought was pretty boring was Swamp of Sorrows.
---
My layer would be so empty. A 37 year old gay guy playing wow who moved to Spain recently while his peers are raising kids or watching Netflix. And my gay peers are either out drinking or in the gym 🙊
---
Nope, I've got a kid this time around and I'd prefer that I stay married to her mother.
---
If they are not able to fix jumping through the layers. And where do they say that the layering will last a couple of months?
---
As Alliance on a PvP server.  Stonetalon Mountain.  Fuck. That. Place.
---
&gt; It's immediately obvious why this is a problem
---
I don't agree with you here, the million or so players on retail probably don't/wont/can't care about layering because they are completely happy with how phasing works on retail
---
Agreed. If we're going to restrict it for pvp's sake, restricting to non-contested territory seems like the best idea. Unleash the full zerg at redridge/stonetalon level.
---
Noob question. Can you swap gear in combat?
---
I could see a tank wiping in a raid and me sealing gear and tanking the boss (with a macro about doing so to alert other healers)
---
There are other issues at play than 1 server = 1 server. Merges cause problems, peoples characters get deleted, names get changed, people get kicked out of guilds. Non sharded Servers are more unstable and require more work. (How do I know this? Classic servers hold less people and they have made comments in the past about server stability) As well as tons of other issues I'm sure I'm not aware of. 
---
The devs said that changing items to be tradable saved them money. Just making BoP items tradable saved them shitloads in CS. So imagine not having to deal with actual character deletions and name issues.
---
It wasn't a thing before because there were what, a hundred servers? Some high pop, some low pop. It can be a thing now because the total player base will be much less, and there will also be a guaranteed sharp dropoff in population after a couple of months. If there were more servers, this could lead some realms to become ghost towns, and that would suck for people on those realms. This is a much better short term solution.
---
I did not expect this kind of response. I think Classic WOW community will be more toxic than current BFA.
---
Like I've been watching a group of streamers level in Classic. There's 20-25 of them. They broke off into 4-5 groups.
---
Any gather/collect quests are functionally impossible if they're in the same area at the same time(plus other randoms).
---
Anyone who just wants unmitigated large realms is asking for a 4 hour Coldridge Valley/Valley of Trials. And given the glut of Night Elves an even longer Shadowglen.
---
Yeah it’d certainly take a bit more time, but purely from a money conservation POV it wouldn’t be a bad idea. I’m gonna be rolling Priest, so farming mobs won’t be ideal. My gold income’s gonna basically come from herb/fish/cooking/alchemy, so saving up for an epic mount is already gonna a take a while. I don’t mind taking a little longer to get a Winterspring Cat if that means I’ll save money on PreBIS, or whatever else.
---
Can someone ELI5 this layering/sharding thing for a guy who’s a real tech dummy. Please 🙏🏻
---
Thanks in advance.
---
Ya 1-20 zones is reasonable, though OP would still have the issue above with the Orgrimmar fight as Durotar would be affected still
---
100% in the same boat man. I was planning on trying it, but focusing all my real time into retail. But the more and more i watch. The more i remember why i feel in love with this game back in BC. Things being hard. Actually making friends. Having a sense of real community. God i can't wait.
---
They can make a character on the same layer. If they don't get that this product is not meant for them. 
---
So yes, they can fuck off and play something else.
---
Private server data is there, but of course the player base is very different. With this in mind: 
---
The Nost post-mortem document lists 55% of accounts quitting within 2 months, and another 15% in the following 6 months. So this supports the expectation of a significant population loss within the first weeks, even among a private server crowd of people who went out of their way to play vanilla WoW.
---
So I would expect significantly less than 10% of players to create a character on a server to stick around, due to the 'free' subscription for retail players and release hype. Maybe around 3-5%? That would mean around 20 layers at launch at least.
---
Someone paint this already
---
And not just queue experience but a 'stare at the login screen because the servers crash every other second' experience. The streamers managed to get the world servers to crash even in the stress test. If there were thousands of players on the same zones the servers would literally be constantly recovering from crashes.
---
Yeah IIRC traveling back and forth between the quest giver and the quest areas was like 90% of the time sink.
---
It's almost as if people testing it in beta will lead them to see what the potential problems are and fix them.
---
I love interacting with people, handing out stuff that I don't need for free, and overall just making friends who will run dungeons with me later and have fun together.  
---
It doesn't matter if an item costs 10 gold in the AH if it's worthless for my class/profession. I will just hand it out to my internet-friend-in-need. And if I need something that I can't get and worked hard on trying to get, I'm sure someone will help me out eventually, or if not, then tough cookies, I go on and try later.
---
The layout of this zone always bugged me. It felt on-rails, and you always have to run through the same places to get somewhere else. Look at the minimap for this zone, it's mostly untraversable mountains: https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/wowpedia/f/fa/WorldMap-StonetalonMountains-old.jpg
---
[Layering was a constant issue throughout his entire stream](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/438242065)
---
Why? What does it matter? Would you stop playing WoW because of a negative story in the news?  I know I wouldn’t:
---
They can't abuse layering anymore than they can abuse spawns. The more layers there are the more patrols you need to tag the devilsaurs.
---
Sick comeback. But your #NoLayering reddit flash mob is as annoying as it is ineffective.
---
I’m really concerned about this layering tech. I don’t understand why they don’t just make more servers and have a lower population cap???
---
I’m also really scared that blizzard is going to put in a bunch of cash grabs into vanilla. 
---
Blizzard is on thin ice with me regarding Classic... we’ll see what changes they make (if any) and what direction they head... I’m as nervous as I am excited.
---
The blue pvp sets weren't updated they are completely new items with different item ID's. The original set requires level 58 while the updated one is level 60.
---
For example - https://classicdb.ch/?itemset=362 vs https://classicdb.ch/?itemset=550
---
It'll be interesting to see how they handle this because the level 60 sets would be really overpowered if released in phase 2.
---
Zulfurrak is an instance. Instances are unique and not layered. Once you zoned in you would be fine.
---
The new one is better.
---
If on my warrior, I am afraid of everything that moves.  Low level, I can take rogues, but they usually won't attack until I am half dead which makes it impossible.
---
THE CASUALS WILL BE ON EVERY LAYER.
---
None of the dungeons you mentiones are max level dungeons
---
Hi! I'm a retail player.
---
I also played in Vanilla, even have the proof.
---
I think layering is the best of all possible options as long as it's for a limited period.
---
I mean BFA one looks better lmao what kind of question is this. BFA is trash those and classic is a million times better so....
---
No idea.  Don’t care if they were.  Has no impact on me at all.  If they want to do crack, that’s their choice. Whatever jostles their jolly’s.
---
‘I didn’t put much thought into it to begin with but at least I’m committed’ - Adolf hitler
---
Actually dope
---
But 10-60 are warp speed. Think of it as basic training
---
That’s very kind of you! You can always offer services if people bring their own mats
---
&gt;Can I level up my character as a holy priest?
---
Normally you go discipline/holy and wand stuff to death.
---
&gt;How good is holy priest as a solo player?
---
Honestly it's terrible. You will want to group up to kill anything.
---
&gt;What activities I can do in endgame(max level) other than raids?
---
Dungeons, professions, pvp.
---
Shadow will give you independence. If you aren't going to raid you may as well.
---
From what they said, layers aren't "by zone" - they're based on total server pop and it's a later of the entire world, not just the zone. It's not CRZ.
---
I suppose you'd have said the same positive things about sharding 10 years ago and that is still glitched and bugging out, with mining nodes disappearing and entire raid groups disappearing and magically appearing amongst a bunch of enemies and walking out into a rainy day only for the weather to magically change...
---
These things never work out the way we imagine they will in our minds. They are messy solutions to messy problems. Many of us do not believe that this is the right messy solution since it will fuck up so many things that can't be easily anticipated as it is currently, in beta, fucking up many things. 
---
Again...people were positive about sharding when it was forthcoming and those problems persist a decade later. Now is the time for people who know how badly this will go to make their voices heard and hopefully convince Blizzard to come up with a better solution. 
---
Best solution: a net of 4+ regular servers with reserved names and a plan to eventually merge. At least then people and nodes and NPCs won't be warping in and out of alternate dimensions in an MMORPG.
---
Get a load of this guy
---
Because they should fix it now, and not 2.5 months from now.
---
I wonder if these zones could be made with noggit studio on a private project.. Would probably take a long time though.  
---
   
---
Anyway, pretty cool.
---
Hmm it seems we see this particular topic very differently, which might be the reason for our disagreement of how best to solve the problems. 
---
I think close to 50% of players will have stopped playing or vastly reduced their playtime in two weeks time.  And after the first month this trend should be clear to see the number of subscription getting cancelled again or at least people sticking with BfA.
---
How many layers do you think they will have? Layers will be world wide, so lets say 5000 players join one server. They all want to quest in the early zones. So you need like 10 layers to make that playable with 5min respawns. People will hit 60 within a week and can start farming rares, black lotus, other herbs, daredevils by jumping 10 layers...
---
Yeah welcome to layering. War mode breaks the use of summoning stones within parties too.
---
Since I’m questing I’m most likely leveling and at that point it’s always hunters. Those fucking talented pets eat quest gear ppl up and basically resist everything.
---
What the fuck?  How did I forget about this?
---
*Irradiation intensifies*
---
I hope so!
---
The analogy here would be that OP is arguing that motorbikes suck but what he is explaining is actually bicycles. Yes both vehicles have two wheels and you ride them but they are not the same thing. Getting this distinction correct and understanding what the difference between the two is sort of required if you want to make a proper argument.
---
Yeah, I'm looking forward to getting the old faces back for some of my characters. (female orc, female gnome. Seriously, what did they do to the gnome faces?)
---
Needing on rolls for my enchanting.
---
but in this case, isn't the government the one placing the rule that the bars cant sell to underage etc.? They are just upholding the law.
---
 If health risks become a concern, shouldn't the governments be the one to step in and tell gaming companies that they will have to place a limit on accounts , say at 3 days, before booting the player off for afew hrs? Then bliz would just uphold this law.
---
&gt;I’m really concerned about this layering tech. I don’t understand why they don’t just make more servers and have a lower population cap???
---
2 reasons - they don't want server queues (because people WANT IT NOW and can't wait - lol)
---
- and because they don't want to merge dead servers after the first couple of months 
---
&gt;I’m also really scared that blizzard is going to put in a bunch of cash grabs into vanilla. 
---
Zero chance - their cash grab is requiring a sub people already paid and played 15 years ago
---
The Upper class. They just get their parents to buy their gear
---
stonetalon mountains, just nope.
---
fugly zone, run forever to quests, bad layout, skippable by better zones. basically the only reason i was ever there every horde char ever was to grab the fp and get to desolace
---
A guild mate of mine got booted off in WPL trying to fly into arathi (horde).  He got decimated.
---
Stonetalon Mountains. I hate that logging area. I hate Harpies. And I hate how so close together the mobs are
---
I guess you would have to spend more in the cash shop. :-)
---
I feel like I’m missing something. How are so many people in this thread stock fucking certain they’re smarter than all of Blizz’s Classic team on this matter? There’s clearly a fuckin reason they’ve gone with Layering and they’re bothering to test it - if the other solution worked, and was easy to implement as everyone seems to think it is, they’d definitely have thought of it. Fuck me dead, you’d think everyone in this subreddit was some kind of god-tier lead game dev with the sorts of “factual” opinions they bring.
---
I could understand the point of layering (which has been explained to us in the tipsout interview, amongst other places) and still think dislike layering as a mechanism.
---
I could also simply play the game, experience layering as a mechanism, never heard of it before, disliking what it does to the game and that'd be the end of it.
---
Both things should be valid. Not liking something literally means exactly that, you do not like a thing. It's not fucking mandatory to **have to** understand why the thing exists and everything to not like the thing.
---
3 weeks to collect and address *all* bugs/issues, with 9 weeks left (lets say they should be "done" 2 weeks before launch).
---
So think about how many things have been reported, and how many things they've already addressed. And then realised they have 3x the amount of time left they've already used.
---
Yes, layering is not fit for launch with its current implementation. But it seems like there's this sudden deluge on this subreddit that it's all hopeless and they should pull the plug now, despite them having a lot of time left.
---
The payoff of them trying to make a very good implementation of layering is worth the effort. It'll make launch very smooth, and post-launch communities very healthy. So give them a chance.
---
&gt; there will be huge backlash if this keeps up 
---
Can you imagine being so delusional you believe this
---
The people moaning about layering make up a *fraction* of the people who are going to play Classic, I'd bet you 3/4 can't even tell you how layering works.
---
Not to mention the lack of layering would necessitate them to create more servers instead, leading to ghost town servers in a few months.
---
That would mean one month of four hours per day. You're wayyy off.
---
Please just remove layering at this point, I know they want to have a smooth launch, but I'd rather deal with fighting 1000 players for a single mob and server crashes in the first week or two than all the problems this causes. Or, just limit it to the low level zones where there's nothing gamebreaking that can be done with layering. People will get more and more spread out as you get higher level anyway.
---
&gt;More hours put in, more resources you have.
---
Ah, but that stops being true if the resources are limited, as they were in vanilla.
---
It's a genuine problem, this over-farming. Before, a guild with ten high-tier farming elites would still only be able to capitalise on 1x the resources, now, they can potentially capitalise on 10x the resources, while also avoiding competition/slowdown from the opposite faction in terms of ganking.
---
It's obviously not ideal if what you're looking for is the experience of battling over said resources, both economically and literally.
---
It's literally true. There's absolutely no way the servers could handle thousands of players on same zone. They'd have to make tons of realms which is exactly something they don't want to do because most of them would die quickly when the tourists leave.
---
Yeah i know, im pretty sure they clarified it before
---
me\_irl
---
This is such a non issue, but maybe it’s the gap in technical understanding that causes these issues. 
---
First of all, with modern server infrastructure, the cheapest way forward for blizzard is indeed to create many more servers than they need, then eventually merge them based on what makes sense from a population and faction balance perspective. This is undeniable. There are no more physical servers, and adding 50/60/70/80 and so on servers makes virtually no impact to their bottom line. 
---
Secondly, developing new technology (layering) to solve this issue adds a lot of extra hours to the project, seemingly this is what they are using the beta for at this stage (that, and marketing). 
---
So, why layering then? Because Blizzard believes this is the only way to recreate an authentic vanilla experience in the long run with regards to creating servers that live organically based on their respective player base, as long as they get it to work as intended. There is literally no monetary gains from doing this, other than delivering the best experience possible for the players. 
---
Why? Because every other option leads to either dead servers, mega servers, or merged servers with communities lost/non existent/restarted. What’s the point of rolling on a server, getting to know people from both factions for good or bad, only to have the population transferred to the three or four other viable ones? And what happens to the competitive guilds who rolled on the same server for the exact purpose of competing against each other?
---
The only real and practical way to solve this is through something like layering, where the server consists of as many layers as needed, until they aren’t needed anymore. 
---
You should be glad they are toying with all the parameters and sending people across layers at random, this is very much needed if they want to have it working come August. 
---
There will always be some weird interactions though, and my bet is that this is part of their testing, in terms of looting, player interactions, pvp, rare spawns etc. There is a lot to account for, and it was starting to look like this was strictly a marketing campaign, I am happy it’s not.
---
None with my bubble hearth
---
Most people care about their name and would hate to see it changed.
---
That the bird is the word
---
&gt; let's be real, nobody really cares
---
A lot of people fucking cared back when they had to do that. I guess you weren't playing back then.
---
What about boss loot drop rates
---
WHAT JOY IS THERE IN THIS CURSE
---
I love discord, why don't you like it?
---
The fact you can make specific channels and pin important stuff is enough to convince me over a ventrilo/teamspeak thing.
---
For big raids it might not be optimal tho.
---
Maybe do it after level 50 so you can work on your pre-BiS.
---
&gt;Can you imagine 100 people trying to kill the same quest mob?
---
Thats how it's going to be on launch with layering, did you not see the stress tests?
---
*S-stop bullying Blizzard and Classic, its all g-good, my favorite streamer has been wholly positive and that means the game is good and layering is a non issue!*
---
The state of this sub for months.
---
Probably because the high elf models are embarrassingly bad
---
Merging servers is an antiquated solution, and a bad one at that. If layering can be implemented correctly and they determine a good way to prevent abuses, it's the best solution
---
I have a feeling it will turn out sort of the same way Oldschool Runescape did. It is still more popular than Runescape 3. However, the main difference between that and WoW is that WoW has a story that has already been told. And unless they retcon the hell out of it, there is a specific path they have to take with the game eventually. 
---
The game will be massively popular on launch. Due mostly to the hype around it but also because it's new. Players will drop out pretty rapidly in the first month once they learn how grindy Vanilla was. (Most of these will be people that started post-cata imo) But there will be a decent chunk of people that loved Vanilla that will stay for the long haul.
---
oof
---
Except that didn't happen on live because it was bannable, and still is bannable. Private server creation.
---
Or maybe you're naive and immature
---
Why do I have to have had played Vanilla as a condition to be on thin ice with blizzard regarding classic?
---
I’ve played retail for years. If they add an ingame store in Classic with gear you can buy... then anyone with a brain knows the investors have taken over Classic and things will be headed in the same direction as Classic you stupid fuck.
---
Old one simply because it has the WC3 voice.
---
How would he or anyone know...
---
They added a bit to cover up her previously naked belly. The part that covers it up is the only piece of tan-brown leather on her.
---
It's a move that caters to SJW's just like removing the "sexy" Overwatch poses, covering up Jaina's bosom in hearthstone.
---
&gt; They'd have to make tons of realms
---
Yes they would.
---
&gt; There's absolutely no way the servers could handle thousands of players on same zone. 
---
That wouldn't happen on launch if they invested in servers. But they don't want to because of $$
---
&gt; something they don't want to do because most of them would die quickly when the tourists leave.
---
They will server merge. Which they will need to do anyway.
---
There was a whole story devoted to the horde burning down Teldrassil and genociding the night elves, you can visit old Darnassus by talking to an NPC, but story wise, the whole tree is burned.
---
The Venomhide Ravasaur, and it wasn't added until Wrath of the Lich King.
---
Your points about sharding are simply technically wrong.
---
the 1.12.1 talents wasn't part of leveling on release in vanilla. Why would it be for classic?
---
the 1.12.1 itemization wasn't part of leveling on release in vanilla. Why would it be for classic?
---
Silithus and Winterspring wasn't part of leveling on release in vanilla. Why would it be for classic?
---
you can add a second sub to your account and log in twice on one account
---
I really like this! Thanks for doing it
---
Your reply reflects the bfa beta mentality perfectly :)
---
Which is sad considering its friken 2019
---
No idea, like I said he went on a mini rant last night
---
Where did they say it will not last for a couple months?
---
Sad I loved that quest!
---
Flex on brother
---
The solution is and always has been:
---
Server 1, 2, 3, and 4 share the same player/guild names pool and an eventual plan to merge, precluding the need to worry about name changes. 
---
Until the merge they are independent servers. No sharding. No warping in and out of reality.
---
Hey - I have already had this argument with an obnoxious redditor such as yourself ([link](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bowd7m/the_layering_is_just_sharding_i_will_never_played/entm5sy/) and he had to delete his comments because he was proven so fucking wrong haha.
---
I suspect you will have to do the same.
---
Explain to me how a MKTRQ Reactor explodes? You can't, therefore it didn't happen.
---
is that the professor on the court?
---
Then you merge em, how is that too complicated to grasp?
---
&gt; If they add an ingame store in Classic with gear you can buy...
---
Well considering there’s no store to buy gear in love WoW it seems rather sensationalist to think they’d add one to classic.
---
&gt; then anyone with a brain knows the investors have taken over Classic and things will be headed in the same direction as Classic you stupid fuck.
---
Oh... you’re that guy.  Haha, have a nice day random twelve year old child.
---
[so good](https://youtu.be/ksIoXxj4yzQ?t=258)

Well, welcome to the internet where everyone is an expert

its about the game! not the faction

^^^^^ This guy/gal gets it.
---
Server names have not been released, however they are going to get the servers up on August 13, two weeks before release. Active subs are able to create up to 3 characters per server, but they cannot log in until the release date, August 27. During this two week period people will find streamer servers and update which ones they are playing on this useful website http://www.avoidstreamers.com/

Shimmering flats in 1k needles. It’s just a circle of nothing with low drop rates and low spawns in specific areas. This is one of the few areas where I actually time spawns when I kill the vultures that are sporadically placed (not the 3 vultures by the bones). The pvp can be overkill there and you especially don’t want to die in the southern region of the flats by the basilisks.
---
Honestly if you can find a guild that will let you be the ONE shadow priest you are good. Shadow brings a buff that increases the damage of all warlocks in the raid, So every raid will always have 1 shadow priest. That being said you're not going to be competing for top damage. You would be there for utility.
---
you're fucking stupid, just thought' i'd let you know just incase you didn't.
---
The concerns have been made. Over and over. I might be wrong, but I am willing to bet that no one at Blizzard HQ is running to a boardroom screaming, "There are now 10,001 reddit posts about layering! Shut it down. SHUT IT DOWN!"
---
Can we talk about something else now, please?
---
lol read this and a part of my soul died.
---
To be honest, I’m scared of everything in classic, only because I’m not 100% on my PvP game in retail. But I loved PvP in Vanilla (even though I sucked bad and died every time) I’m chomping at the bit to see if my skills improved since back in the day
---
But u could be a paladin on a striped frosty tiger instead
---
Yes, but, c'mon man....not only is the current model still ridiculously cool, but it makes far more sense to not leave yourself laughably exposed.
---
This could just as easily be less about Blizz catering to "SJW"s and more about them realizing how unnecessarily sexualized they made her in the 3rd one in the first place. Self-reflection, if you will.
---
Because they're the types of people that's never satisfied no matter what. There's no pleasing people that'll complain for the sake of complaining.
---
I did this a 70 and it still took ages. Won't be doing it again in a hurry.
---
Yes, yes I am. I got my first Winterspring Tiger in TBC. This time I will try to get it as my first epic mount as I do not like the Mechanostriders (unfortunately). Good luck to all farming this. Patience is a virtue.
---
Is it better than Server 1, 2, 3, and 4 sharing a player/guild name pool and an eventual plan to merge? I think that is the best solution and kind of seems like the idea behind layering before someone got "clever" with it and thought they'd automate it.
---
Do what, roll alliance? Na
---
Because of the smaller barrier to entry. Most of the players (as far as I know) already own the game and have played either vanilla or another version of WoW at some point. All the people that currently have a BfA subscription are going to be making a classic character for sure, but how many of these players will actually stick with it? I know most of my irl friends plan on playing classic but zero of them are currently playing on private servers or retail and in general they have stopped playing on the newer servers within the first month or at least greatly reduces their playtime.
---
They did say it would not be present in phase 2 no?
---
With a group that'd be enough time to wreck an economy by collecting plenty ressources via layer hoping + dumping it on another and gain enough gold to dictate the prices for the future.
---
I might be over reacting a bit, but this makes me not want to resub for Classic at all.
---
Blizzard doesn't want server merges because of player drop-off. So they assume that packing in thousands and thousands of people onto 1 server, but split into different layers, they can mitigate play drop-off.
---
They just don't want to get screwed releasing more servers than necessary so we're stuck with this layering thing. Hopefully they remove it after 3 weeks like they said they would, but I wouldn't put any trust in them.
---
I enjoyed this story
---
I'll go for the insane title first!
---
Actually, they won't have to, because that's not how layering works, and you're not a game designer for world of warcraft. If you were and pitched that mechanic, though, you'd be laughed out of the room, which would be pretty funny.
---
I wouldn't, but some new, younger players may not be able to start or continue playing. And we all know "young blood" is needed for any long term sustainability of a product. It is only for so long old gizzards like us can carry to torch.
---
Agree, but I’d rather stare at flippy girl’s hot ass for 2 years than midget bung. Priest included. Dwarf fear ward is disgustingly OP, but desperate prayer is a 10 min CD and stone form is a 3 min CD, so I’ll live without them and stock up on consumes. :)
---
Youre right. Im complaining about the rage not about the critic
---
Also: [https://www.vanillafriends.com/](https://www.vanillafriends.com/)
---
Black lotus on private servers is most likely **not** more expensive than it was back in vanilla. The discrepancy you note would be due to general inflation. This inflation is brought about by the increased popularity of AoE grinding, DM tribute runs, solo maraudon runs, etc. While these things were also possible back in vanilla, they were used nowhere **near** as widely. Therefore, less gold was pumped into the game, and therefore a lower price tag does not inherently reflect a lower cost after accounting for inflation.
---
So in your world mature people should tolerate bigots?  Unbelievable
---
a) You can only accept the first quest at lvl58.
---
b) Without an epic mount and decent gear finishing the quest itself takes ages.
---
c) Grinding this way to 60 gets you about 10% of the total way to the Frostsaber (someone did the math in another post) at the expense of about twice the time it would usually take you.
---
Impressive how that is the conclusion you came to
---
Aaaaaaaahahahahhahaha.
---
Filthy horde.
---
If I am gonna round up 800 gp for a go-fast armored superhorse, I am damn well going to ride nothing else.
---
&gt;10-15k on prime time? If you think that’s fun, good for you.
---
I do find it vastly more enjoyable.
---
&gt;The vast majority of the playerbase would agree that’s an insane amount of players for one server.
---
Thats your assumption, and either way Blizz could have a middle ground and host both type of servers.
---
Obviously the higher pop ones would be vastly more popular for obvious reasons.
---
How to tell if someone is an OG WoW player-
---
They use MySpace.
---
&gt; Which is why its fucking laughable when people (including blizzard) think that the population will be low enough a few weeks after launch to remove layering.
---
!RemindMe September 27, 2019 "Has Blizzard removed layering from the vast majority of Classic WoW servers?"
---
Imagine a group of gnomes and instead of saying oogagangshit they just all go https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6n3pFFPSlW4
---
&gt;The only logical solution is to setup a server group for people, that after launch it will be combined into one server. 
---
How exactly is that different from layering?
---
Your friend made some claims. Next time just ask for evidence for those claims.
---
What can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.
---
You’re the prick that’s coming in saying I’m not allowed to be excited for classic since I never played Vanilla. Gate keeping at its finest. 
---
The point remains - retail WoW was handed over to investors and the game turned into a cash grab with easy loot and rewards for everyone.
---
I don’t want Classic to turn into the same thing. The more I play retail the more excited I become for Classic - I do see why Vanilla is better than retail.
---
I still have those shirts they sold at hot topic with the class logo in the middle. Also one that says “I survived barrens chat” I can’t wear them anymore cause I bought them when I was 15 but I still have them for nostalgia.
---
It did happen and will happen again. Will it be as bad as on private? No. But you're crazy if you think people won't find ways to surreptitiously collude behind the scenes. ToS only works if the violation is visible.

Thats fucking sharding, not layering, fuck that. Its horrible and have no place in an world based MMO.
---
&gt; How do I join?
---
By going back to /v/.
---
With a server group you'll never get the chance to meet people on the different servers. At least layering does allow us to mingle with everybody who will be a permanent member of the server.
---
That's the way I see it, anyway.
---
Lmaooooo the accuracy
---
&gt;if that is your point why blizzard is using layering because of money than i am done here. 
---
That is LITERALLY the sole reason it is there dude...
---
It's not for the players man, this is the point I'm trying to make. This very point. You have been tricked. 
---
&gt;Your last paragraph tells it all. Just hating on blizzard. 
---
Stating facts is not hating on Blizzard.
---
There isn't, an equivalent was only added later.
---
My hot take is: they should add the Ravasaur quest for Horde, but have it be as grindy as the Frostsaber, not the "easy" way it was implemented in wrath #changes
---
Good luck man! Don't listen to the haters. Sure there may be competiton out there, But there always will be in everything in life. If it something you are interested in go for it!
---
Next time call his bluff and watch him get bent out of shape lol
---
Rogues. Always Rogues. You just never see them coming, and when they get you it's usually a death. They only attack when you're fighting something, of course. The luxury to pick your battles and escape is really powerful in world pvp. Plus they're just dicks. :)
---
That makes me happy thanks for the reply
---
Nope just weapons I believe
---
I'ts not.
---
This isn't a bad idea. Do the math, this is a horrible idea.
---
Lol what do I even have to delete? A comment that says you don't work for Blizzard and literally cannot "guarantee" anything about what they're going to do? 
---
Boy, I'm sure gonna eat my words on that one when it turns out you did work for Blizzard this whole time.
---
I love westfall. Cant wait to go there on my Druid and kill the Defias Traitor lol. Such a fun time.
---
I never really quested there though. I think I had one human before other than that if I was Alliance I always had a NE or gnome
---
If there is ONE thing to rage about in Classic, it's PHASING in VANILLA. Especially when we can see people layer hop and loot arena chests and stuff in the beta. I can't think of anything more reasonable to rage about.
---
How so? Theoretically, if each layer holds the normal population of a vanilla server then the balance of available resources vs the demand for those resources should stay the same.
---
If your friend played private servers, give him a gentle reminder that everything is actually dropping *less* on Classic.
---
I'm curious about that too. I know Fury spec is better DPS output though.
---
Sometimes, but there’s hardly a shortage of healers. You’ll see people begging for tanks. 2nd to that is mage DPS. Sounds counterintuitive but several classes are capable of healing 5s, not many have utility and dmg of mage plus water portals CC etc and certainly tanks don’t want to deal with PUGs and druids are fairly unpopular
---
Blues or füll t3 is a BIIIIG diffference
---
Best way to gain threat on multiple targets:
---
Pop zerker rage (optional)
---
Pull
---
Pop blood rage, and battle shout near whole group - buffing nearby party gives you threat on all pulled mobs.
---
Proceed to tab shield block/sunder/revenge
---
Shouting is an extremely underrated threat generation tool (demoralizing is more for applying a de buff, my current understanding is that buffing party members threat gen &gt; applying debuff threat gen so battle shout is better in 90% of cases)
---
I don't believe there was battlegroups in vanilla, it was just faction v faction?
---
During the Stress Test, a group of Alliance attacked Valley of Trials, amongst the group I recognised my brother's online name (no chance it would be anyone else) who I've not spoken to for several years.  
---
Was a bit surreal.
---
Not over reacting, reacting like a lot of players probably want to but then again, a lot of players are still holding onto the notion that classic is going to be the same as they remember. If something this game changing has already been integrated into the game, there's no telling what else will find its way here.
---
I just didn't get my hopes up because I didn't want this to be disappointing, I'll just play it for the old mechanics and the slower pace, I just wonder how it will turn out.
---
I'll admit I was expecting "I traded him the 10 slot bags and he fucking dipped and ignored". Glad I was wrong.
---
You can talk about anything you want. I'm going to add my voice to the group of people warning about the inevitable and incredible damage this stupid system is going to do with a small hope that Blizzard will reconsider. 
---
I kind of feel like they may have gotten lost with their heads up their asses and that we can show them the way back out. Classic could be great. We were almost there! They had everything in place, even with sharding the 1-10 experience. Then they just *had* to fucking add world sharding to their Vanilla recreation. That is incredibly ridiculous and only the kind of thing that people that are too close to a project can do when they lost perspective.
---

If I were you I'd join a guild and always raid,
---
And never never never never never leave my house again...
---
That’s the world of Warcraft that you play!
---
That's my point when top guilds are funneling gear loot and speed/farm runs of dungeons and hit Max level before anyone else and can abuse this sharding mechanic to corner markets on items long before they have competition which will have effects lasting much longer than a month.
---
&gt; I'm sure gonna eat my words on that one
---
Lets put a thinking cap on... do you truly believe "a lot" autistic person is mentally capable of making a structurally coherent post on the internet and then have the tenacity to respond to comments. 
---
Use Google to familiarize yourself with "levels" of autism before you make these kind of comments.
---
I dont have a reliable source of information but I want to remember changing to a 2h when not actively tanking was the best course of action.
---
No, I do not.
---
Blizzard servers are too bad so they compensate with layering.
---
Anything in this dicussion is pointless man. Discussion is basically pointless right now. You're gonna yell and cry and realize in a week after a blue post that they were just testing it... So yeah, chill out. Wait for a real reason to panic instead of crying wolf
---
Even if its "vanilla friends" You can still register and see if there are matches. its not really restricted to vanilla.
---
It would be static in that people wouldn’t be able to switch between different servers.  If/when the population stabilizes, they would merge the server group, which would be predefined, into one server.  
---
Not sure if I like this approach or not, but I can see it’s merits in being discussed.
---
My guess would be to stay with the sword and shield, just which out gear for more ap/crit
---
Makes me think of Archer and Austin Powers.
---
Awesome!
---
I think the issue there is that it will be hard to predict which servers will be low population and need to be merged. They won't know until the players choose. They will get a sense of it when the open up servers for name creation/guild coordination and such, but they could tie two servers together that end up being huge.
---
And then you will be locked into this zones and have to wait until a place is free in a higher level zone? So every zone change it will be a chance for a waiting list, except the low level ones?
---
Does Details! work in Classic?
---
I'm just saying wait and see, no guarantee they fuck up, but we're two months away. Wait just one month at least before sounding the alarm idk
---
"WTS INVITE TO SHARD WITH LOTS OF BLACK LOTUS. 10G FOR 15 MINUTES"

---
To be fair, if you’d followed the private server scene, it’s extremely obvious. These guilds have been playing this game for 4-5+ years as a group, consistently improving, doing speed runs, figuring out pretty much all ins and outs there are. Even with major differences between private server builds and classic, which there aren’t really, private server guilds will dominate in every aspect. 
---
The joke here is that they’ve actually researched it, and figured out that guilds on private servers have been planning for this for years on end, practicing in their own sandbox, while retail players have been stuck in a completely different game. There’s no way they’re competing against them on three months notice.
---
59-60 can take like 3-4 hours while every level from 1-120 takes 35 minutes ish
---
Yeah, prolly 2h fury tho, just based off drops and hit tho.
---
Good point.
---
My favorite Sylvania is a dead Sylvania! For the Horde!
---
Great post. Above all RP-PvP players prize immersion and world building. The mechanics and flavor that faded since vanilla are the things we loved most about the game.
---
The RPPVP audience is indeed the very core audience of Classic. We love the danger, the heavy RPG elements, the community aspect, and the big, persistent world most of all. And I don't mean to say that others aren't true fans or anything like that, just that Classic is EXACTLY the sort of game that an RPPvPer loves most.
---
&gt; As a 14/5/31 Protection warrior 
---
You're missing 1 point here. And I'd go more with a 17/3/31 if I was you.
---
As always, a source cannot be provided, what a surprise.
---
I don't understand what you are trying to say here... Blizzard states they dont want it past phase 1. Is AQ in phase 1? The AQ opening is for level 60 players and by that point most of the "tourists" have left the game. The players present at AQ won't care as much about overcrowding compared to what new/old players in starting zones would.
---
It is so great to have a random redditor telling me how "this works". Should we have a !remind me  so you can tell me "i told you so" when AQ opens?
---
fair point
---
1 day of layering will fuck up the economy? Explain to me how.

You think people will be farming devilsaur leather day 1?
---
Priests are always focused down pretty bad so if you’re not playing with peelers like mage buddies you’re gonna hate life. You’re not mobile enough to kite and your mana gets trashed trying to stay alive, heal others, and the constant viper stings you’ll have on you. It’s a fun class but it’s much like a warrior in that you need group support
---
I was gonna ask if you did it yourself, and then I saw that you actually did, and now I feel kinda bad... But hey, to each his own :)
---
Hunter's do not have an easier time getting in raids, maybe in MC but they start to drop off really fast and you only every need 2-3 in a raid group. A priest healing in shadow spec would have an easier time getting into a raid.
---
As a Shadow Priest you are there to give warlocks +shadow damage on the bosses and return health back either for the warlock group (after they lifetap) or the tank group with vampiric embrace. Your damage will usually be on par with that on hunters (300ish DPS), depending on how many consumables you bring and probably won't go much higher than that. SW:Pain won't be allowed due to the debuff limit. Raids usually only take 1 SP with them too.
---
For PvP though, SPs can pretty much destroy anyone. The combination of your absorb shield and blackout + high mind blast/flay damage reks anyone without purge or very high burst.
---
I don't know. But from past experience I don't know of any mmo that has had a 50% player base dropoff. Especially one this hyped. Even if it has substantial dropoff I don't see it going down two weeks in. Up if anything.
---
Bottom line 200-400 hrs of not sleeping is probably not good for a person and may end tragically especially if act of sitting and energy drinks are involved.
---
Ah its been a while we had a good sharding thread, lets mess up this dead horse real good this time
---
Sometimes I wonder if people who doomsday about ever tried to compete over mobs/items with 4 other people, let alone thousand
---
...no, but there will be more than one server.
---
What am I looking at?
---
&gt;It did happen
---
Source ?
---
It’s a pretty long cast time, so it’s best when disc with PI plus 2 points in mana burn talents to be really useful
---
But dynamic spawning on private server was ok, with no effect on the economy?
---
I filled out the survey too, and the question about the likelihood of purchasing a Character Boost was **$50** if it saved me **90** hours of leveling.  Do you think they could be trying to find out the ratio people would pay for time 'saved'?
---
Have any moxen instead?
---
I loved the questline with those dailys in wrath :3
---
As I said, I'm an EU player and Dire Maul + Azuregos + Kazzak came not even a month after EU release. It wasn't a problem back then, why should it be now?
---
You also have to remember that between the private servers and the original vanilla experience, people know far more about classic than they ever did in vanilla. I think, this a factor Blizzard is massively underestimating and staggering the content too far apart would cause major problems. 
---
Another factor is putting items out in their 1.12 incarnation. A LOT of lvl 60 dungeon loot was previously fairly useless and massively upgraded in 1.10 to be nearly as good as molten core gear. 
---
2020 is an absolute joke for phase 2, by that time even casual guilds will have cleared MC. Phase 1 should last 3 months at maximum and I think 9-11 weeks is more realistic, especially considering it barely adds anything to the endgame content but two world bosses. 
---
So, you have players, who by and large, will be a lot more knowledgable about the game and they are supported by more modern talents and items. And you want to drag out Phase 1 to last longer than the time between initial US release and patch 1.3? Totally bonkers.

---
&gt; Buy more servers. That's too hard and complicated though.
---
How does that help with most of the servers then dying after the tourists leave and overtime as player numbers decline? The entire point of of sharding was to fix this problem but it's like you people don't understand even the basis. Mergers were absolute shit back then it would be shit now too. It kills the community.
---
You could take that this way as well... for me beta is not appealing due to having to lvl to 40 only to get wiped before release. I think people dont realise that the main reason of the beta is bug reporting and fixing... game testing. Unless everyone is hyped for the game testing and reporting I dont understand the hype for the beta ( of course I do, but i dont...)

In the blizzcon presentation of wow classic (see this video, at 34:40  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wS1juqaiW3o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wS1juqaiW3o) ) they explain exactly, that they will not touch the debuff limit. It is explained, that it was only a technical reason that it ever got implemented and it is probably bad game design but they will still not touch it, because they don´t want to risk the authentic classic balancing.
---
In a hyper charged world with SJW on every corner of the Internets and Blizz not doing so good as a company, I am not sure bad publicity is what they need.
---
Eh, so long as you hit the first cap, I think dual wielding would still be a dps increase.
---
Can confirm, I’m a dick.
---
But I never attack people who is not at 100% health.
---
It would a bit, but there would still be some time unaccounted for if each player was at the Max (for Joana) or Min (for Classic).  Pre Cata, the latency indicator was for the "World" latency, and in Vanilla a green indicator was for &lt;200ms pings.  So if Joana had 199ms ping, and the guy in the Classic video had 0ms ping, there is still a dependency of ~140ms when comparing Joana's overall times to the Classic times.
---
Consider that if they cut the retail level cap to 60, a few things might work really well.
---
Like character boosts, and transferring from classic to retail.
---
It’s most definitely not, Girl Scout :p
---
I can post healed pictures in a week or two.
---
No I don’t think I will.
---
I'd say closer to 3x longer if youre not abusing rested xp
---
Does beta use her original voice that she had in vanilla?
---
If they did it because they cared, they would've done something more meaningful than adding a leather strip that doesn't even match the rest of her colorset.
---
When you have as many tattoos as I do, one more ain’t no thang. For the Horde!
---
Shimmering Flats by far for me
---
I feel like WoW isn't a game that has much charm with its graphics. I agree that Blizzards redesign of some assets (prarie dog) went from "low polygon count collection of angles" to "sorta disney feeling" but largely, the game could benefit from a facelift.
---
I loved WoW for its community, gameplay that really put people together, friends I made, raid mechanics are great, identifying with your role (proud tank, benevolent healer, putting up points on those DPS charts, or pvp competitor), not for its 1999 post warcraft 3 engine looking graphics.
---
I often feel like the only thing that lets WoW look decent is that they have a semi cartoony art style that lends well to the engine.
---
But after e3 and seeing the FF7 remake in action ooooooooh dear god do I want WoW to play like WoW but look like what it could, if it were modernized.
---
It's easier to know when it's sarcasm when you know the person, because you know how he talks, acts, if he uses sarcasm a lot or never.. I personally never watched that guy so I thought he was serious.
---
More people need to speak up. Everyone on here agrees it sucks. The only issue is they think it's not possible for anything to happen at this point.
---
I thought that's what the beta was for? To find what was wrong with the game and fix it.
---
Just a random wow one i found while searching google
---
Esfand, asmongold, tipsout, staysafe
---
So you're not paying for my hospital.
---
Yeah but this is quite different from a new release. I would imagine that at least 2-3 times the current BfA subscribers isn’t an unrealistic number for people trying the servers again. So even loosing 50% quickly would still be a great success for the game overall. 
---
Because this is such an unique situation I find it very hard to predict how it will pan out.
---
Good luck, you may just find yourself getting that  Pom pyro reflected at your tiny face...
---
I only played from tbc and when I found out about this it was at the start of wotlk and they made it way easier then. Tipping towards alliance just for this mount tbh..am I right in thinking there is only so much rep you can gain in a day? Like it's 120 hours but you can't just non life it in a week?
---
I was thinking Human troll
---
Because say you find a black lotus spawn. Odds are one has spawned there on other layers as well. Have a friend invite you to a new layer, you phase to them, pick the black lotus on their layer, and move on. You've now picked 2 black lotus when you normally would have only found 1. Now add more than 1 other layer and you see the potential for serious abuse. 
---
We've already seen this happen in the beta with MN mining mithril ore and Venruki and the AGM trinket.
---
Mate they also have melee leeway in. Which is a non vanilla mechanic and it’s buffed warriors and rogues and nerfed mages big time
---
druids have a lot of intrinsic features that people often underrate or forget about, like travel form at level 30, aquatic form for infinite underwater breathing, roots lasting for half a minute, seeing through stealth with faerie fire, and cat form prowl to name a few. 
---
even without being feral, prowl proves amazing for stealth runs, duo content (like brd arena farm), and just skipping over large swathes of mobs while you quest.
---
at max level, druids have incredibly deep mana pools, beating out both shamans and priests but losing to paladins longevity-wise. if every pull is clean, you seldom have to drink, perfect for chaining
---
Is it reasonable grinding in terms of profs and loot?
---
If you play seriously you will have farm periods regardless
---
TBH, this kind of question is exactly what I expect from Blizzard nowadays.
---
They announced this layering thing when I was on a two week vacation. When I got back and read about it I just stared at my screen for two minutes. 
---
I went watched this game decline once and anticipated how most of the changes that diminished the game would play out. It's very frustrating that anybody is  defending this because we are the only chance of stopping it. 
---
Players will be popping in and out of reality. Players will game the system. Your perception of the game world will now have to take into account which layer of a server you are on, instead of being a player in a single cohesive game world. 
---
I actually saw layering in action in SWTOR back in 2013 and I promise everybody that it damages immersion when players on your own server are not visible to you. When they are available but on Hoth 3 and you're on Hoth 2 and so, though you're at the same place, you cannot see one another until one of you interacts with your UI to select the toggle to warp into the other dimension.
---
Yeah cleanse is dirt cheap you can OOM hunters on viper lol
---
I prefer that my friend pops in, instead of he is in the queue for hours and I can't play with him
---
And yet we have handrails on stairs and safety instructions on every item. Why not apply "Darwin do his thing" to everything. 
---
Darwin did his thing and we have evolved into a society that protects everyone.
---
WotLK's, the armor they introduced in Legion sucked.
---
If each layer has the normal amount of vanilla players, then it should just be it’s own server.
---
I'd have bought it as a solution to the likely scenario of a sharp drop in players after the initial rush.
---
But I'm realizing even that is a symptom of a larger, misguided direction for Classic - that of giving it to BFA tourists, for free.
---
This issue might also have been solved by requiring a separate sub for Classic.  Even better, a 3 or 6 month only sub for at least the fist 3 or 6 months.  Get only the people really interested in it long term; have a much more accurate measure of long term population. Size realms accordingly.
---
I think its perfect ;)
---
lol, ngl, that was definitely some of the fuckery I did. 
---
There was also one time some buddies, a mage and a priest, wanted in on it, so they ran through IF ressing until they were deep in, then I met them at one of the houses and we camped out in there, fighting off the few alliance that came by, until the hornets nest was well and truly stirred up. Then we noped out of there.
---
I really like all the nooks and crannies of Stormwind. There's little shops waaaay in the back somewhere that just look so quiet and cozy. Basement stockrooms, hearty, atmospheric bars, surrounded by fairy tale forestry. I feel most comfortable there.
---
Ironforge is a close second. It feels a little too big and wide open when it's empty, but otherwise feels like an impenetrable safe.
---
You know deep down which side you need to be on.. come back to us!
---
People who actually know how to play the game and level efficiently know that doing quests at low.level without the mount is just not efficient. Better to grind mobs.
---
And also the fact that 4 groups of people are waiting for that quest mob. 
---
And believe me layering will not change anything to your competition with 4 people for that quest mob or item
---
You would only know that if you explored the Tower of Azora.
---
Just remove all of those and make vendors for all of it :^)
---
Why are you dissing your own hunter by calling him a huntard?
---
Rogue! You camp redridge.
---
That doesn't solve the problem of overpopulation though, that's just moving a bottleneck from one place to another. I'm afraid you don't understand the problem that layering is in place to solve.
---
Not if people find a ways to gather the equivaöent of multiple server while others miss these amounts making the gap wider between lowest and highest gold amount. This would seriously impact the economy.
---
new
---
Very true, A few of my friends have suggested that we just play on a private server until calssic launch but whats the point. I don't want anything to take away from the classic launch for me. And leveling on a private server would probably make launch day not as exciting.
---
Hell no!! Took me three days in wotlk, when stuff died from just moonfire. Can't imagine how tedious it is in classic.
---
omfg low effort meme which some people are enjoying QUICK SUMMON THE MODS TO END THIS FUN, WE NEED MORE DEBATES ABOUT STREAMERS IN THIS SUB, STAT!
---
I'd also argue that 4x the amount of things makes it 4x harder for control via a single Mafia/syndicate. Honestly it might be better and have some cheap front end costs... Until they turn it off and those prices skyrocket.
---
It's probably the one thing I'll achieve in classic. Probably won't have time to raid now a days
---
Generally, people don't treat kills as RP victories. If my guild farms Rag, we'd refer to it as exploring Molten Core, maybe we killed some big scary elementals for glory, but nobody is going to declare themselves Slayer of Elemental Lords and the Wielder of Sulfuras. You can absolutely have some badass gear and RP that badassery, but you never want to put yourself on too high a pedestal or you risk Mary Sueing yourself.
---
It works out. Just like you, we like classic because you're a small person in a big world, not the other way around. 
---
As for player death, it varies. Some people just play it straight and canonize the spirit healer. Otherwise, there are plenty of ways to RP-ize a death scenario. We retreated with injuries, or got KO'd until the healer revived us, etc.
---
Im pretty excited for it. Ill also be moving the 29th so its going to suck trying to get play &amp; unpack/set up. Hopefully the net gets working right away :(
---
&gt; I have already told you, Customer service. How? Less people using it.
---
How? Why would people use less customer service with sharding?
---
Dude, I played legit vanilla up to Naxx.  
---
Def Cap is 440 (not 400-430) for a lvl 60 character against lvl 63 mobs. And that's impossible to reach without raid gear, even speccing into 10defense.  
---
What the fuck are you blabbering about? Everyone is going to clear MC with a MT who's not def capped.
---
Just signed up. Thanks bud
---
Ty
---
I think competing with 4 people and competing with 1000 is a major difference, no?
---
Alexensual has probably managed to set up a new discord after his last one got banned and now he's sending his zealots to "be loud and obnoxious" about the things he don't like.
---
***But he loot chest!***
---
That’s actually a great solution
---
As a Druid Ill only run from Warlocks. Maybe Pallys but simply because I dont want a 10 minute fight only for them to bubble hearth.
---
They could have just more realms and no layering and merge realms when that happens that share a name db between battlegroups. But your sub idea would probably work to some extent as well.
---
Ffs I've told you. In detail. Google some YouTube videos if you don't understand at this point
---
Good luck! I'll be over here enjoying Classic (well, not really... because I'm not in beta... /walks away sadly)
---
I’d like to eventually complete all quests and max out all reputations, so I definitely want that mount.
---
I’m not 100% set on my class, yet. I’m leaning towards a Hunter. This grind would surely be easier on a Hunter, right?
---
Im trying to keep my hopes at bay, this sadly isnt the same blizzard we all grew to love.
---
I liked the idea of only being able to hop layers if your in a major city.
---
I do not think there is time to get meaningful fixes to core system but at the very least it needs to be improved so "layer affinity" or "stickiness" (for lack of a better term) becomes the focus.
---
1. Interactions with players **or** NPC should prevent you from getting shunted to another layer for a meaningful amount of time  
---
   ie, trading, merchants, combat should prevent you from hoping for at least the duration and a couple minutes after.
---
2. Your layer should be cached when logging out, for the same amount of time needed to [expire your login credentials](https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/10989) (5mins it is now?)
---
Hunter that's uhhh orc or troll whichever gets bonus damage vs beasts!
---
You’ll pull aggro the most for almost ever unless you let the warrior tag everything first and get about 20% down. When you get spirit tap you have to ask to get killing blows after that, but you can get a wand around 10
---
&gt; merge exactly like how it was done in Classic: rarely.
---
Classic rarely needed mergers because the population was CONSTANTLY RISING. At no point during vanilla was population declining, whereas now with Classic the population will be highest on launch and then start declining at different rates. It's completely different and trying to handle it like it was done in Vanilla will ensure an abolute shitshow.
---
There was nothing humble about Sylvanas ever
---
&gt;14/5/31

17/3/31 Impale?
---
Any Prot spec lacks a good rage dump like MS or BT. Slam, Shield Slam, and Whirlwind are available. Both Slam and Whirlwind are pretty bad with a one-handed weapon. So I would suggest pooling rage while dual wielding or using a 2H, depending on available gear, and spending the rage after switching to a 2H, using as much offensive gear as possible. With a half-way decent 2H, this should be better than just spamming Heroic Strike and Shield Slam with a 1H and shield.
---
The One-Handed Specialization talent increases your OH damage as well when dual wielding.
---
To die
---
While frustrating, the waiting for stuff to respawn gave me time to mess around in general chat without slowing down my progression more.
---
I never said you couldn’t be excited I said you have no basis for a comparison for your distrust in the accuracy of the depiction of classic vs vanilla.  Nothing more.  As to the “cash grab” you feel retail is... I don’t disagree but it’s disingenuous to make up fictional examples like selling loot.
---
No.   They are sometimes taken for the shadow weaving buff to buff warlock damage.   Particularly if there are 4 locks or more.  But their damage alone is not competitive in PvE.
---
Two rp PvP realms would give hardcore players who like rp, and the thousands of people trying to avoid streamers trying a mutual home. A home where people aren't trying to breeze thru end game. Rushing to 60 is ok though, gotta escape the ganks.
---
They definitely should've put more hidden areas behind mountain passes in the zone. The lack of quests doesn't help either. I don't think there are any quests that even target the wyverns around the lake in the middle?
---
Yea this is a mistake on blizz end if they keep sharding that long
---
for the most part yes, they arent allowed to SW:P but for a few fights they can.
---
Please reply to the correct bot region post, not directly to the thread
---
I will just patiently wait for the release and definitely not going to rush even after that... I am just going to enjoy the classic experience as at the time of vanilla I could not. I still have to make that big decision of what to play anyway.. stil not decided :)
---
Make it first 2 zones and we've got a deal.
---
Vast majority LOLOL, way to add an exception there 👍
---
Personally I don’t like Desolace.
---
Well if you don't I guess you don't.
---
Can i ask what your income for selling leather looks like at these low levels? My current plan is herbalism and skinning to get my mount funded.
---
Or we’ve seen where trusting blizzard (the company) gets us. I’m sure that Omar and all the other blizzard devs are as passionate about their project as the most eager fan. Sadly though at Blizzard (the company) there’s a technical and/or finance person who’s pushing the devs to lowball, cut corners, just utilise the same tech as BFA in the interests of squeezing out a few more dollars. Hell, the devs themselves probably have it as a KPI.
---
I hope the main Blizzlike pservers don’t wipe their character data...
---
Mergers we're shit because at the point you needed them the game was dying. That's the thing though, you don't need them for a long time. That said, your argument for layering is that there will be a server merge 12 months in instead of 9?  Not a strong argument to me.
---
Besides it requiring 39 other people to be somewhat coherent, MC is a cake walk.
---
pair up with this tank, then all you need are dps to wander in
---
This is the only reason I’m rolling alliance
---
Layering is not working as described if anyone on the beta is able to experience layers at all. Maybe I'm wrong but it seems like the beta population is pretty low (certainly under 3k concurrent players) which means layering shouldn't exist and stuff like this shouldn't be possible. 
---
I'm hoping they're still working on the layering tech because I'm ok with layering in the way it was described by the dev team, but this stuff is unacceptable.
---
Had a fully twinked 19 dwarf hunter right at xp cap and then wanted to wpvp one day and leveled on discovery xp. I can remember this moment very clearly and how I felt.
---
I levelled to 60 as a melee hunter because i thought weapons looked cooler than shooting
---
Technically the lead developers may be smarter, but practically they need to develop something that works for the users (players in this case).   
---
Why even go through the work of creating classicwow, if it's not going to end up to be a product the players want?  
---
I find your opinion on this completely out of touch on how this works. But what do I know?
---
the classic team is just devs they moved off of BFA so yeah I think its safe to say they have the potential to fuck the game up if they do it wrong.
---
and before you ask, yes I do work for an indie game studio.
---
Barrens size was actually inconvenient sort of on-purpose.  Tauren were supposed to have plansrunning as a fast-normal-move ability so a giant zone would be less troublesome to them than other races.
---
After some late beta stuff, plainsrunning was tossed out, but it was too late to mess with the geography.
---
Not personally; however, most countries utilize healthcare that relies partially or in full on taxes. In my statement "I am paying for", the "I" represents everyone around you since everyone is paying for everyone's healthcare. I would have used "We as a society" to be more clear.
---
Im in the beta, and have a level 40 Hunter. They have fixed massive amount of bugs already. More than the bfa beta. The problem in the BFA beta was classes and systems had to be completely reworked/rebalanced. 
---
Classics content is already done and works 100%. All the quests. All the instances. Class balance is done. Set in stone. The entire classic team is just bug fixing minor things. 
---
Classic could come out today and be completely playable and fun/not broken for anyone. Everyone in the beta is having a great time. Non of the bugs are "game breaking"
---
Basically layering is the only thing they need to tune before launch. 
---
It'll be fine.
---
I'm in the exact same situation as you. I decided to just go human because another thread somewhere here on the subreddit someone compared mage dps on gnome vs human, and it was like 258 vs 256, pretty insignificant imo.
---
The main advantage for gnomes is Escape Artist, which I admit will be missed on my human mage, but I think the advantage from it isn't enough to justify playing a race I would hate looking at.
---
It is different because you never will be out of this group.  Currently you can hop layers, get items over again, kill mobs over and over again.   
---
This at LEAST will keep a static environment.
---
Yeah it's different than a new release: It has 10 times the hype.
---
Falmar is worthless. No reason to sustain it and no strategic advantage. Switch vanguard point with falmar or make eastwatch a bigger settlement and falmar some trogg city, if you love troggs so much.
---
120 hours? Should only take the average person on this sub like, 5 1/2 days to get it done
---
This is not Deviate Fish, this is Firefin Snapper that's used by alchemist to create Fire Oil used for Fire Protection Potion. Deviate Fish is caught from every pool in The Barrens.
---
For all the hate this sub gives streamers the discussions here sure do fall in line with exactly what they're doing. I hadn't seen a thread about layering in weeks, it was all about elite mob damage since streamers were blazing through SM so easily. Now layering is back to the hot topic. Streamers need to hold another duel tournament so everyone can get outraged at blizzards banning policy. Those were fun threads.
---
the center of the map is nothing but purple lotus's
---
How is this any different than introducing layering? It wasn't in Vanilla, so any change is not "no changes". Any person screaming no-changes should be just as much against this as layering.
---
I once randomly met one of the Orc warriors I knew on my server (I was playing Alliance) when I was on a Holiday in Italy. 
---
Played tons of AB and WSG with my premade and sometimes I would just chill out fishing with him in AB or throw snow balls at each other. We were pretty good friends in game despite not being able to speak to each other so it was pretty funny actually meeting the guy.
---
Yeah cause that Diablo mobile game everyone is in love with that Blizzard paid millions to develop is probably going to do great lol
---
Layering isn't CRZ. It's not per zone. It's for the entire world.
---
&gt; Unless of course you have a server cap at 30k more like what they would have with layers, but only allowing 3k to be online at the same time in the first several weeks
---
Back in vanilla your average realms had like 30k-50k players but could only have 3k or 4k online at the same time. This is because contrary to popular views people don't actually play 24/7. Just like your local grocery store can only fit and service a small fraction of their normal userbase at any given moment.
---
&gt; It wasn't a problem back then, why should it be now?   
---
&gt; people know far more about classic than they ever did in vanilla 
---
You answered your own question in the very next sentence. Because it's not 2004/5 any more. Back then you'd be lucky to even be 60 by the time DM rolled around in the EU. Classic is going to be a very different animal. You have people who know exactly which piece of gear is best for which slot for which class and spec, and that DM totally messes with T1 progression. That's *precisely* the reason why they're staggering it, *not* the reason why they should rush it. 
---
&gt; especially considering it barely adds anything to the endgame content but two world bosses
---
These massive oversights are why your arguments are are falling flat. You think adding the honor system is "barely anything"? The servers are going to go absolutely apeshit when honor makes it in. Leveling on PVP servers is going to be hell on earth, which yes, is part of the fun, but Blizzard aren't about to screw over the more casual players just because they didn't have the time to get to 60 in 11 weeks.
---
You're making the mistake of thinking that Blizz are going to cater exclusively to the people who finish content in a few weeks and then complain that they have nothing to do. That's exactly what landed us with retail. There are going to be *plenty* of casual Classic players and you'd be crazy to think Blizz is going to screw themselves out of subscription money by prioritizing the hardcore and leaving everyone else in the dust. I know you're going to argue that "the hardcore players will leave if Blizz don't hurry up the phases" but those people are a minority, and January 2020 would be just long enough to keep them on the line.
---
Well too bad i've been paying all those years for plenty of people who only got to a hospital for stupid reasons. Never complained.
---
He said he played lightstorm?
---
I'm realizing layering perhaps wouldn't even be necessary were Classic not being given free to BFA players.  A separate sub, or better yet 3 or 6 month only sub at the outset, would also address the issue of a large rush and drop of players, by attracting only those truly interested in the long term.
---
I'm realizing it's just another facet of the vision of the game needing to be as easy as possible for Timmy to get his boar asses uninterrupted.  Individual player convenience uber alles. Classic's not being thought of as what it and its predecessors were - **MMOs**.
---
I.E. games where your gameplay could be, and was, impacted by (gasp) *other players* in a persistent, cohesive realm, and this feature was considered core to the genre.
---
It's looking at this point like the best course for true Classic fans may be to wait it out until when, or if, sharding / layering is removed.
---
If we're going to end up with 20k player realms, then why do we need x-ream BG's?
---
That's every server at launch
---
Doesn’t hydra play on a PvE server? Not necessarily a bad thing, but it misses out on some PvP tension and the leveling experience is quite different than speed running PvE
---
It's obvious that something is wrong with the layering tech in general. Layering is not working as described if anyone on the beta is able to experience layers at all. Maybe I'm wrong but it seems like the beta population is pretty low (certainly under 3k concurrent players) which means layering shouldn't exist and stuff like this shouldn't be possible. 
---
I'm hoping they're still working on the layering tech because I'm ok with layering in the way it was described by the dev team, but this stuff is absolutely unacceptable.
---
Lol I'm not sure what source I could possibly find that would prove that people camped devilsaurs cross-faction 15 years ago. It happened on my server, Burning Blade US, especially by Chinese farmers later in the expansion. Believe me if you want.
---
This. Can confirm sniping people in 06 vanilla, using a spy and aim. Go to pve to avoid it.
---
It explodes because of lies.
---
I don't think you know what the word exponentially means, why would we listen to someone who didn't finish 3rd grade?
---
Isn't that just floating combat text? 
---
Either way, if it's not in the base game it will most certainly be in an addon.
---
8/26 papa :) hope the servers allow me to connect at 6pm and not 9:30
---
Its just from the incredibles...
---
There was a lot of testing with the SM graveyard rares.  I don't know the actual frequency of occurrence, but it was tested (and farmed).
---
While we can assume this will happen and I agree with you. We have no actual idea how it will go. It could go up. We have no idea. In the past though, has there ever been a huge drop off WEEKS into a new release? No. Have they needed merges weeks after release? No. 
---
So I don't see what the issue around this is?
---
Not sure about BS building agro when just being renewed. But I think you can macro so u remove atleast your own BS before applying a new one = atleast 1 person worth of agro each time.
---
He was also the guy who got server 1st 40 by only running instances.  Instances are sharded content that was in the game from the start. There's really no need for layering when you've got sharded content already in place.
---
Its the incredibles theme
---
Something like that has always been my pipedream. A private server that actually adds well-made custom content that fits in the universe.
---
A friend of mine showcased me some custom dungeon prototype he built for the vanilla client many years ago, so I'm sure adding new areas is possible.
---
Stormwind is not just a castle, it can be both the city stormwind(walled city) or the castle attached to it(stormwind keep), SFK is a castle with a keep, SFK fits better than SW for the "castle" definition. But when using the ingame terminology i suppose you are right.
---
Only the layer locking makes sense, rested zones would mean no grouping with randoms from chat
---
solo leveling as a prot warrior and never tanking a dungeon
---
Damn I got dumpstered...
---
I gotta catch up on my toddler movies
---
So, the issue is just that one can temporarily transfer freely between "servers" (or layers or however you want to call them)?
---
Well, I thought it was about something important.
---
Elite sets OMEGALUL
---
Assuming your chat isn't already limited to your layer
---
Hahahahah
---
I'm going warrior as first char because I want a spot in a raiding guild, and I want to be as highly geared as possible at all times because I'm really waiting for bwl when warriors start to scale and become monsters. 
---
I also think tanks will be really in demand even more than normal during phase one and I have a priest friend and we're gonna charge ppl for runs at 60 to make gold while we get our pre raid BiS. 
---
Mage will be my second because of gold and fun!
---
Such a simple and effective site, I really appreciate it! Definitely bookmarked for launch.
---
Objectively BFA model is obviously better. But I'd be lying if I didn't admit that I have a negative pavlovian reaction to seeing it, thanks to the disappointing story direction of the past decade.
---
Shock!!! Horror!!!!

i am one of those mages who shares his water without any trouble. but at least just trade me and dont wait for me to run across the raid to hand you your water. i am not your mum bringing you mntn dew to your desk.
---
&gt;I'm hoping they're still working on the layering tech because I'm ok with layering in the way it was described by the dev team
---
Most important part that people refuse to acknowledge. I completely agree with you and accept that it's a necessary evil to fit all the tourists in :)
---
Not nearly enough info here - what's your price range? What type of monitor do you have? What resolution do you want to play at, and how many FPS? (If you dont have something currently, I am guessing 60FPS at 1080p is fine). Do you already have a monitor? Mouse/Keyboard? Headset/speakers?
---
I’m just glad I experienced actual vanilla from 2004-07.
---
I’m sure this game will be ok
---
I don't remember either, but I do not think they stun and incapacitate are treated the same in this case.  Otherwise, would also receive increased damage when attacking sapped or gouged target for which I am sure that you do not.
---
It isn't and shouldn't be imo. I like the idea of layer hopping so people who rather play in an overcrowded one may
---
Yeah for sure, but I never just walk up and open trade without asking.
---
Lol i change my mind on the same thing at least 2-3 times a week. I have it down to either feral druid, shadow priest, or rogue. Most likely druid though.
---
You managed to sum up 3 paragraphs of my thoughts into a single perfect example. Thank you.
---
Much respect and love. I'd rather at least be ambushed while not fighting other crap.
---
&gt; That basically what /u/Embriel said.
---
Might be. But my honest opinion would be that he sucked at saying it then.
---
"You're hating on the wrong thing. This (using a different word with a slight different meaning) is the thing you should be hating. At least know the difference" =/= "If you're going to dislike it at least try to understand the technology beforehand."
---
And the post he replied to hated on what he saw in the video, no matter the word he used to describe it. All I'm seeing is people just trying hard to seem like they're better than everybody else. All I'm doing is defending the right to hate, since the hate isn't directed towards people but towards a thing that may or may not have negative impact on a game I'm looking forward to.

Current estimate is around 3k. No one but Blizzard knows for sure though.

It's not inconceivable that a single server, some sort of ultra-dense streamer server that every twitch fanboy feels the need to play on, has some issues with Eastern Kingdoms even a few weeks after launch. 
---
For the vast majority of servers it will all go according to plan. The idea that there's secretly 6+ million people all waiting to bum rush vanilla WoW and play it for months is absurd.
---
Wooooord. Incredibly kind of you, and greatly appreciated. I had my own spreadsheet going, but I will probably just use this now.

Come back to your post in about 70+ days and feel free to say i told ya. I'm just saying if a lot of people are vocal about it it might change , prolly wont tho. And  please stop saying that we're unsure what implications it might cause or what systems it might break cause a lot of people already know how to abuse said system in various different ways.
---
When I was prepping fire resistance for rag, I remember farming Lord incendius for fire resistance agi bracers. At that point in time I had a mix of dungeon blues and tier 1. So this sounds pretty close
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man
---
Just play a private server kid
---
It is still possible for imbalances to happen ... it's just less likely. I am going to use made up numbers here.
---
Let's say 1 million people play at or around launch. And we'll say 10,000 is the optimal number of players per server.
---
They can launch with 100 servers to accommodate that 1 million. With 100 servers, chances are pretty high that there will be several with severe faction imbalances. This will also still require either queues to play or extra sharding for starting zones at least. I think queues is a TERRIBLE idea, but it is an option.
---
Now, let's say 40% of players quit before level 60... I don't know, 6 months. That's 400,000 players. It would be real, real swell if each server saw exactly 4,000 people leave (2,000 from each faction) ... but that won't be the case. So you've have really poorly balances servers. You are going to have to merge servers (which, contrary to popular belief, will have economic implications, among other issues).
---
Another option would be to launch with 20 servers. Each of these servers have 5 layers each (to be able to handle 10,000 players on each layer, 50,000 players per server). You'd still be able to easily keep friends and guilds together with these servers-within-servers (and you'd be able to manipulate faction imbalances on the fly. And once players start leaving (they WILL leave), you have a much higher chance of keeping things balanced because you can just switch populations around within these layers.
---
There are possible exploits with layering... but I feel like those are easy to address than the bigger issue of server/faction balancing.
---
Oof. I usually don't attack on my own, so the classes that are worst when they get the drop on you stick out to me. That is hunters, mages, warlocks. Also priests.
---
Least scared of rogues and druids, and fellow warriors.
---
And yet we pay a subscription fee for it, so it should be both.
---
Them shutting down the proper beta servers until monday is super irritating imo. No one wants to test AV 3 days straight.

---
Did you just ask me how dynamic re-spawns for certain low level mobs is different than entire layers which include rare spawns, nodes, and loot chests? It should be pretty obvious. The worst abuse that occurs with low level dynamic spawns is fast level 1-20 times. Layering/sharding at high level zones can be abused to farm materials fast.
---
Doesn't matter.
---
She's muh queen!
---
I am rolling spriest or lock … not sure yet. Also tempted with a mage, but I just like to see those dots slowly working on my enemies :)
---
No, add a layer changer in the starter areas if you will, otherwise, layer change at capital. Much like WarMode in retail. No layer changes except in the designated places.
---
This will eliminate layer hopping for resources and "phasing" when actively outing the world.
---
Pog
---
I'm not saying it's a complicated solution. I'm saying it's a poor solution. You don't just pick the bad answer because it's the easy answer.
---
&gt;I feel like WoW isn't a game that has much charm with its graphics.
---
Well, that is quite subjective, but WoW's art is loved by many. Personally I think FF7 remake graphics would directly ruin WoW for me. Not that FF7 looks bad, but a key reason why I love WoW is the graphics. I've played so many MMORPG just to quit them because the graphics wasn't my cup of tea, but just looking at WoW pictures can almost make me resub. Especially the BfA graphics are amazing to me. No, it is not the highest detail graphics out there, but I really love the look and feel of it. 
---
To each his own, but the art is generally one of the only thing Blizzard have never fucked up in many peoples eyes.
---
Layering will be gone within a few months and has been stated that it will be removed after the first phase. There’s no reason to even work on a solution for it.
---
It isn't a stun, but tooltip (either repentance or SoComm) should say that JoComm benefits from it
---
How does this conversation always go from "c'mon man, think of day 1" to "it's only for a month or two" in the same damn breath? Do you not see the difference? A ton of people are going to level all the way to 60 with layering active. All because of "day 1."
---
Here is a better solution (and simpler too):
---
You can only change layers in a rest area. Such as a city, INN, etc. 
---
You want to group with others from same area? Go meet in an INN (like you normally would in a RP game), sync to same layer, go out into the world.
---
If layering happens I'm probs not going to play classic for a long time.

---
The entire point of layering is to avoid having to start with a bunch of extra servers and then merge them later on once the initial rush dies down.
---
I feel like it wouldn't even be so bad if it worked like they said it would. But it's clearly poorly derived from the sharding tech if people are phasing in and out. Despite Omar saying "Our key goal was to do what's right for Classic and for that we effectively built out a **new technology** called layering". 
---
I hope they fix it. Otherwise you are right.
---
Oh my god where the hell are the mods this morning?  This sudden layering brigade is annoying as all hell.
---
Enhancement please! Glad to see it's on the Todo list, will definitely be checking back for it.
---
Who the hell asked for sharding? that's like THE feature that caused controversy and had to be explained to calm people down so we can actually swallow it. Tolerating it because it might be necessary is one thing, actively demanding it as a feature in classic is another and is one that goes against the purpose of classic.
---
Yes, a system needs to be in place, but I believe they pretty much said it will not affect us, which was hard to believe. We now have proof that it may cause problems. Problems that will only get MUCH bigger with a player count a lot higher than the players in a closed beta..
---
I believe you are correct.
---
probably to guard the wildhammer lands to the north though, this whole thing only works with the other zone: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bzhrmi/what_the_twilight_highlands_might_have_looked/
---
otherwise yeah, that would be a dumb place for the town
---
As far as I know pservers will give players their encrypted character data so should there be pservers after classic that could allow character "transfers" but obviously the big ones will shut down.
---
There will always be cheap players who play pservers just because they are free and pservers make money by selling gold and stuff so the incentive is there for them to exist even if they are trash.
---
&gt;I'd honestly rather just have one singular server with like 5k players. Even if it ends up with 2.5, that's still a fairly high pop by actual vanilla standards.
---
I mean, I'd rather have a single server with 2.5k players that drops to 2.5k players after all the tourists get bored, but that's only marginally less likely than your fantasy.
---

---
And Critical Roll has millions of followers, but thats a whole different system. Im not sure the communities are the same.
---
Sure, but a big part of this beta is figuring out how to stop people from abusing mechanics like that. It doesn't automatically mean that layering can't work without economic consequences.
---
Frost mages are pretty rough.
---
I agree with you that you are allowed to not like something without understanding the inner workings of said thing. That's not what's happening here tho. OP is confusing two different terms (Phasing and Sharding) and thus creating further confusion.
---
My most hated quest zone is either Winterspring or swamp of sorrows. The terrain annoy the crap out of me in both
---
I was in kt kill guild in retail. 
---
Flasks costs around 500-800 gold. Guild bank would provide a flask to main tank on progression.
---
Only time I saw casters use it was for major kills after lots of practice for twin emps, Cthun, patch,4h and kt.

PvP there's an argument for Dwarf or Gnome
---
I've never seen an addon that does anything other than change the font of floating combat text. Even changing the size wasn't possible until they added the world text scale command. So far I've not seen anyone on Classic beta with healing numbers showing (not SCT which is easily added).
---
That doesn't mean they can't find a solution to stop people from doing that.

I agree there is no evidence. If there was substantial evidence, it would be less easy to question the claim.

It is likely many retail players will check Classic out. But since this is not incompatible with player growth, it does not make having more players a few months after launch an impossibility.

Blizzard secretly doesn't give a fuck about fans. They have immense pressure on their bottom line from higher ups. Vanilla is going to be plagued by this shit.
---
Asmon is a pussy lmao
---
YES... good thing I'm rolling a human.
---
Okay so engi+enchanting.
---
In that case I recommend diremual east boss farming, it specifically requires enchanting. DME is one of the best ways of farming gold in the game, what you do is have 1 fury warrior(or rogue, but warrior better) combined with 1 healer(shaman+paladin is best), and kill 3-4 bosses. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVUKcRqesto
---
So is there any of these classes you would like to play? Warrior, rogue, shaman, paladin, priest or druid? Obviously you would have to be healer for the healer classes, but typically hybrids do get both a healing and a pvp set, and you don't have to get the best of talents to do this. Lastly preferably you would be the healer, since it's a lot easier to find a rogue or warrior with mining than finding a healer with mining, but it should be someone you make good friends with, so you could convince them to reroll one of their profs to mining. 
---
Also you probably wondering what you gonna farm pre DM. Well I would work on things like gearing in dungeons and farming enchant recipes in the world, typically enchant recipes don't require the best dps, it's more about waiting for spawns.
---
&gt; You eat less often for more time, great tradeoff /s
---
Generally, yeah. 
---
&gt;You don't have a greater ability to take on multiple mobs since you do less damage
---
Again, you are overestimating how much difference strength and agility does for a warriors damage output. 
---
&gt;What pvp while leveling a warr, what are you going to do make the rogue killing you spend 2 more seconds?
---
I'm pretty shit at PvP, but even I can kill some players sometimes. If you're an actually skilled PvPer you should be able to kill a lot of bad players, which there are a lot of.
---
Ofc a lot of them were easily preventable. Anything alcohol or drug related is easily avoidable.

Link to the survey would've been nice
---
Hey, what do you think you are doing ruining the circlejerk? NO SOUP FOR YOU!
---
Yup that's what I meant. Hating on one thing believing it to be a completely different thing doesn't help anyone.
---
Some of us are grown adults who have jobs and responsibilities; we can't sit in a six hour queue when we only have an hour or two available.
---
But hey, fuck us filthy casuals, we don't deserve to play the game, right?
---
The demands stays the same but the supply grows.
---
Sorry, in doing so, you created two new layers in addition to your own.
---
I am focused on my own shit but I also believe we don't live in isolation on a one person island. We all kind of need to be concerned what other people are doing we are all kind of connected. 
---
As I have explained in other replies bad publicity and SJW mob can hurt Blizz as a company thus putting TBC or 1.13+ at risk.
---
I got this bug 3 times last night and was booted from my gryphon. Once into the cauldron. Not a happy place for a level 40.
---
Your argument makes no sense. People know more about the game and will have an easier time levelling and that'S why it should be staggered to last lnoger than it did at retail?
---
Yes, phase 2 is one the two minor phases (phase 4 is the other one). Phase 3 adds bwl and bgs. That's the big one, which should take a while, not another 60 dungeon, a few world bosses and the bare bones of pvp.
---
And again, for the third time, as you still haven't adressed it. I played on EU. 1.3 came not even a month into it and honor system not even two months after release. We survived it. It didn't screw our casual players over.
---
Dire Maul messing with T1 progression is an absolute non argument as well. The items, which were upgraded in 1.10 and will be in classic in that incarnation will mess with that much more than Dire Maul ever could. The improved talent trees from the end of vanilla are laso a bigger factor than the dire maul items.
---
And finally January 2020 is LONGER than the original time between US release and 1.3. It will not be longer than that, that's completely bonkers considering people will level faster, have better talents and better items.
---
What’s the grind involve?
---
Know what's even worse? Almost every non-indie game that got dated at E3 launches *after* Classic. They didn't give us much to play with until then.
---
No one's gonna say Badlands? The revamp made Badlands good, but it was fucking rough on Alliance in classic. Lethlor Ravine was nice to farm the whelp pet, but it seriously did not have very much going for it otherwise, questing was pretty limited.
---
No, because that doesn't solve the problem of dead servers in a couple of months. Layering does.
---
I can't. Explain to me how a small group of no-lifers could permanently damage the economy in under a month. The stuff you'd be gaining access to are all consumables or crafted BoPs. Even if someone could farm a thousand rare gathering mats, they'd eventually run out of supply and they'd be back to competing with everyone else.
---
Is it possible to gain an advantage that could last you a few months? Sure. A year? It's theoretically possible, but highly unlikely. Beyond that? No.
---
Stop screaming about the sky falling.
---
Debatable
---
This exact thing happened to me a few weeks ago, albeit at like lvl 20. Luckily hearthstone wasn't on cd. It's definitely not good, but I expect it to be resolved prior to launch.
---
He acts like he isn't exactly who he is https://youtu.be/qNidS5s4UFs
---
STV do be like that
---
Yes I will.

Even though this is a joke, I feel the need to grab my pitchfork.

The AH leather market is pretty slow due to the number of players in beta. But farming Leather in Red Ridge is 100% viable for mount farming. I was getting so much I started vendoring it before I picked up LW.
---
I would never have the balls to wear this in public! Good on ya tho. Do you.
---
Why are there layers anyway? I thought that was for the starting areas only
---
I can’t find any numbers that supports that. The best numbers I can find is the average server having about 20k different characters of lvl 10 or higher over a 30 day period. But that would likely mean less than 10k actual subscribers on each server I would imagine. 
---
But if you have some link to support your numbers I’ll gladly take that into account

What /u/octavissi said. [Tree of Life](https://tbc-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?spell=33891) form + Healer = Treeler.
---
Basically the resto version of Moonkin.
---
It was incredible. Finally healing had a form with powerful boosts. Feral already had *two* and balance got one.
---
Later, it was removed. So yeah, TBC was a golden age for resto druids.
---
How would the demand stay that same but the supply grow? More people on the server would mean higher demand.

&gt; They've already said the world will not be layered after phase 1, at least meet them halfway man.
---
We already tried to meet halfway, and they went even further off course. Remember when sharding was supposed to be in the starter zones only?
---
ThInK aBouT tHe ToUrIsTs!
---
This works but the only issue with stockades is that you'll clear 3 chests too quickly and will hit the max instances limit and have to do something while you wait.
---
If I could cash in hunderds of steaks at once I would. Because it's gather 5 ,turn in, repeat. I won't
---
That's an 150 IQ idea.
---
Wait, do you mean to tell me there won't be a dozen empty layers just waiting for the first couple people who hit 60 to farm all the devilsaur leather and Black Lotus without any competition from either faction?
---
It probably will.
---
That's not a tank though
---
Back in vanilla before XRealm queues Alliance was top dog in BGs on our server. There were exceptions sometimes but we ran into the same problem of Alliance boycotting certain BGs...
---
Standing still for an hour trying to tag a mob isn’t FUN.
---
Mage has an error - Atal'ai Gloves cannot be frozen wrath.
---
This is magical
---
The vast majority of players will be people who played more current versions of the game.  Tons of people are going to quit classic is tedious and boring to most once the nostalgia is gone.
---
And in general I think the goal is to have a smoother opening and experience than we actually had in vanilla.
---
"You know that ~~layering~~ sharding is only for the starter zones, right?" - Said 3 months ago. Sorry but I really don't trust them to not change it again.
---
Where did I mention phase 1 was no longer than 2 weeks?
---
So, layering wasn't a thing in Vanilla? Why does it need to be a thing now? I understand maybe needing it for launch. But outside the starter zones. What is the need. I played on a high pop server back then and don't really remember too many issues with overcrowding.
---
Curfew? sure I want someone to take me to a hospital if I decide to sit in one place and stay awake for 72 hrs straight while chugging energy drinks. It is called self harm and we have laws for that. 
---
The limit needs to be something absurd like 72 hrs where 99.99% of people are unaffected. Hence I asked for suggestions BEFORE seeing the level of toxicity from "old school great" Classic WOW community.
---
I really like low-level pvping in Stonetalon, though. The map is unique and has some fun features which makes for fun fights.
---
Thunder Bluff.
---
What amazes me is that this dude doesn't say thanks.
---
Plot twist, there was only 2 guys on this server

JoC benefits from both Stun and Incapacitate effects (Repentance in this case, also works with gouge, and engineering grenades)

To assume nostalgia is the only reason to play classic is like saying we breathe oxygen so our lungs can expand.
---
You might only be in it for nostalgia, but Classic is the best version of WoW.
---
My guild in vanilla was complete trash at raiding so this mount and the bloodsail hat were my crowning achievements. Can’t wait to kill some bears.
---
FYI, here is Monkeynews mining exploit due to layering:

Rogues, I really hate 'em. And warlocks and hunters with their damn pets. Never go up against a mage, they'll just polymorph you. Or druids, they'll shapeshift and run away. If you see a warrior it's probably already too late. Don't bother with priests, paladins or shaman you could DPS on them for days and never get anywhere.
---
If you can do the meat and furbolg quest plus traveling in 30 minutes then it should be about 120 hours which seems possible but only with really good gear and going turbo mode. The meat drop chance is pretty low and you have to travel quite a bit, plus competition might be there, you could get into a PvP fight etc.
---
So it's more realistic to say 200-300 hours. It's not that bad tbh. but definately not 120 hours.
---
Yea I have two subs already. My dad played two characters in vanilla so now I have 2 wow accounts on one bnet account.
---
Oh, do you mean that hypothetical magical time the #nochanges crowd is terrified of when apply of high end mats in the auction house is proportional to the increased population yet somehow the demand isn't?  Yeah, I'm real worried about that...
---
That's certainly your opinion but I think you'll find the vast majority of people won't like all the tedious shit after playing a version without it.
---
Low armor caster bosses with 0-2 adds are solo-able if you have enough gear and/or can abuse LoS mechanics. Like Pyromancer in BRD.
---
I don't think all of Maraudon is doable as a rogue, at least not below T2 gear. I remember soloing Noxxion on a T1+ equipped fury warrior for the trinket and bracers, and I needed CDs and a potion occasionally.
---
Uldir armor was fucking joke, and they even gave up on tier sets, so no class specific armor. BoD armor looks little bit better, but still it's pretty bland.
---
PvP sets look absolutely terrible, I got every single type of armor this season and all of them look horrible.
---
It has everything to do with mages increasing ability to burst you down though.
---
Have fun in wows next expansion.
---
Please no, Monkey Paw :(
---
Yeah, I'd be ok with temporary dynamic respawns.  As long as servers are stable and quest mobs are available, that would be great.  I would assume this would impact server stability though.
---
Private servers can handle launches of 12,000+ people simultaneously on a single server that costs &lt;$1,000 a month and with dynamic respawns leveling was pretty smooth.  It can be done
---
We ARE smarter. 
---
They have other considerations like finances, ease of administration, an internal politics to consider. 
---
We can provide solutions without these nonsensical biases. 
---
Players have proven plenty of times in the past they are smarter than Blizzard. 
---
Blizzard KNOWS this. It’s why they hired a member of the Everquest community to help design the game way back among hundreds of other examples. 
---
This isn’t a physics  or rocket science sub where this shitty argument might actually serve to limit right minded debate which we are entitled to. These are game design decisions, and not particularly hard ones to solve. 
---
Stop with the bullshit please.
---
At lvl 40 cap frost mages can crit upwards of 600+. As a rogue with very good gear this is 1/3 of my health. Also popping priest bubbles is hard to do fast enough.
---
Typically if you were to be dpsing as a offtank in raids you would be wearing nightfall to buff healers and spamming hamstring.
---
But for something like world pve? It's hard to say. Probably attackkiting with 2hander is best.
---
Quests, lots of quests, daily
---
Whats your alternative solution?
---
Healing numbers showed in vanilla.
---
I suggest you watch Congress talking to Google and Facebook CEO's  about this thing "Internets". Tech companies, including Blizz, kind of have this social and corporate responsibility.
---
He did say it should last only a few weeks, but wasn't his promise that layering will be removed before phase 2? Meaning if they think it's necessary, it could last more than just a few weeks. 
---
Kinda like a discussion I had in the past about when Blizz said "enjoy a classic summer!". To me it did not confirm we were getting classic early in the summer. And we are not getting it early.
---
When theres an alliance vs horde gurubashi raid fight I like to have both alliance and horde POV up. Theres very limited choice on alliance side.
---
There are two types.
---
High-traffic PvP: STV, Shimmering Flats being the worst offenders. They're too good to skip, but I like to out level them a good 3 or 4 levels before going there. Having that advantage on other questers goes a long way in deterring attack, and I can kill faster so I can spend less time in the moshpit.
---
Just Plain Inefficient: Alterac Mountains, Blasted Lands, Azshara don't really have enough there to justify all the travel time. HOWEVER, if you know what you're doing and pack your quest log cleverly, all three can be worth doing. You just have to make sure to line everything up.
---
I played Alliance in Vanilla and i fucking loved Westfall, I remember the first time I walked into the zone and the colour palette is so different to Elwynn then the music changes, loved it.
---
You should have read to the end where I specifically said I was not attacking you. And if you took offence to that, you were probably the person it was directed at so maybe you should pay attention.
---
You know that third party boosting services have been around since at least 2006, and are common among private servers.
---
He needs meds badly, watch yourself around him.
---
So that means authentic vanilla gold farmer community? #NoChanges
---
omg, FASTER!
---
Don't be angry at me just because you're wrong my dude.   I haven't played the last few expansions, I like classic.  Most people wont.
---
RemindMe!
---
Barrens chat will be more fucking entertaining.
---
Barrens chat post launch was pure bloody gold.
---
Hydra as in the old school pro priest player? Does he play again?
---
There will be BGs in phase 2 I believe.. but BGs in vanilla never gave XP like they do in retail.
---
If blizzard would have merged existing reals with launch servers there wouldn't be a million kagillion realms
---
I'd say it'd be tougher, but still totally doable.  A hunter does more DPS than a warrior does, and its pet can tank several mobs while both hunter / druid DPS down other mobs. With a Warrior / Druid combo, it'd be tougher, as one of you would be getting beat on, and you'd have less DPS. But both could tank, and switch aggro I guess. 
---
The idea of instance grinding, in only my opinion, is to be moving quite fast.
---
The left one IS better.
---
She’s an average joe-ette, who you can relate to. The right one is a unique model that simply can’t be related to, because you can never get that gear or outfit.
---
I enjoy seeing our leaders and heroes; as just people, who are legends.
---
In vanilla you had to have an add-on as he noted above. I played a healer all through vanilla. You can heal just fine without the floating numbers. The numbers aren't really important other than dick measuring, just watch the health bars and you'll get the feel for which spell you need when. Something I would do is always ask the tank how much hp they had so I would get an idea of which spells to use.
---
I doubt anyone was laughed out of the room when they suggested to do *exactly* that with servers back in 2000-2004.
---
And yet we don't live in the "Animal kingdom" where survival of the fittest and fight or flight are an everyday thing. 
---
I do not pretend to know what's best for others. I am simply suggesting that there is a potential risk and asking it be mitigated.
---
indeed but the classic team might be the best of what's left of it
---
Right.
---
So if anyone else watches him, they're a sperg. If you watch him, your not, because... reasons?
---
Alex is having a meltdown on Twitter over this.
---
It has to be drastically better than this at launch.
---
I dread the prospect of being on a streamer server, but I'd rather risk being merged into one than playing with this.
---
I'm there with you.  I think the vast majority of the quests were concentrated on the edges of the zone, so the middle just felt like a big empty area you had to constantly run through.  The few times there was a quest in the middle of the zone, it basically meant the area you had to roam to get enough wolf spleens or whatever was huge.
---
lol
---
Everyone is saying mage, but it's probably the least relaxed playstyle in pvp. It's highly dependent on small windows of opportunity, timing, positioning, kiting, etc. It's one of the least casual friendly pvp classes (PvE is a different story). 
---
Something way more casual friendly in PvP is hunter or lock. Both classes are beasts in wPvP, little reliance on gear, straightforward playstyles (though high skill caps). The biggest difference is that the skill floor is way way way higher for lock/hunter than mage. An average mage is terrible, whereas an average hunter/lock is going to be favored in most fights.
---
what ever man Activision owns it and has the oversay in everything it does, like it or not.

do you have a source for Atal'ai Gloves cannot be frozen wrath please ?

I do, every day. And yet I am not mad about you reminding me of that.
---
Not great not terrible.
---
I love the idea of filling large empty areas with new zones. Further fleshes out azeroth and gives new opportunities for side stories and minor groups.  #darkIronPort
---
There's at least this one: https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?quest=1134
---
Layering in classic ruins classic. Change my mind
---
&gt;There’s still a huge group of people out there that defend layering because they think Blizzard can do no wrong and they implicitly trust them.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;This sub is now filled with those Diehard Blizz Fans looking for the next bandwagon to jump on.
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man
---
Alternatively, maybe there's a huge group of people who defend layering because they recognise that, while it isn't a perfect solution, it's a far better choice than either having ridiculously high population caps in anticipation of normal levels after a few weeks or having normal caps at launch and then forcing a ton of server merges.
---
Should also consider warrior 2h weapons.  Obvious choices and easy to create.  Due to the high demand and limited drops for 1h weapons, many will run 2h. I can confirm from Vanilla experience Bonereaver's Edge can net a warrior top DPS through MC, ONY, AQ20, and ZG.
---
You might also, if you have the time, create a list of two or three alternatives to each slot, which allows you to include those legendaries and low drop rates you've excluded.  Like just a list at the bottom of the screen.  That might be less worth your time though.
---
If anyone's response is childish, it's yours.
---
Damn that would have been very fun to level a Tauren.
---
I didn't doubt that you could heal fine without it, but in terms of satisfaction, it's something I've always enjoyed. Same goes for damage numbers.
---
No. While slam does big threat it also costs 20 rage. For rage/tps dlam not even top 3
---
Funny, I feel the same about ashenvale. Love stonetalon though. For me I guess it helps that stonetalon has less PvP than Ashenvale, and the alliance counterpart Redridge.
---
I was playing on a server (Private) years ago and mentioned my city I was from. Some guy messaged me he was also from the same city as me. I asked him what was the popular pizza place around town and where was it located.
---
He gave me the pizza place, road, and what school it was near. I was shocked that in a world so big, I ran into a towny on a private server.
---
Was pretty cool.
---
&gt; How do you think does Tailor/Ench. compare to Herb/Alch in terms of goldmaking?
---
Tailoring and enchanting is garbage. You've got two daily cooldowns for pocket money and it's otherwise down to waiting on a bridge and spamming for business. The only half decent money is in bags.
---
- UD shadow priest
---
- Lock
---
- Hunter
---
- Rogue (if you tend toward solo play)
---
That's right. God forbid it. Not every class should be able to heal, tank, and do the same type of damage.
---
Your choices should matter.
---
If you want to tank, choose the class designed to tank. Why would you choose some other class and then complain it can't tank and expect the game to change so your non-tank class can tank like a warrior?!? What is wrong with you?
---
Okay, now imagine without the dynamic respawns part. Also, do pservers really have 12k players the moment it launches? And do they REALLY have no issues whatsoever?

Nostalrius grew from 4.000 players at launch to around 12.000 over 3-4 months. By using Nostalrius player numbers as evidence, one therefore arrives at a conclusion opposite of the assertion made. Ie. that player growth after a few months is not literally impossible.
---
I agree there will be players joining and leaving, but this is not incompatible with player growth. This depends on how many leave compared to how many join and stay. Therefore this also does not make growth literally impossible.
---
First clear will probably going to be around 7-8days. It also depends a lot on how raid resets works, people will want to get a rag kill in before the reset to get more loot. Especially if blizzard does proper itemization so that a lot of rag gear isn't in before phase 2. This makes the chances of specifically BRE and Spinal reaper basically double, so you gotta farm it while you can. 
---
The more "average" hardcore guilds will clear it between week 2-3. It really depends a lot on the guild. You need 40 people lvl55+ preferably some with some good gear. So if your hardcore guild has some players that just don't have the ability to go super hard on launch, you will fall behind on being able to clear rag. Clearing early raids is about the bottom people not slacking, not how good the top is, and even the most hardcore guilds have some people with actual lives. There's a few guilds that want to do 2 raid teams, these will have a huge advantage in clearing MC early, because with 80 raiders, you are guaranteed to have 40 people absolute no life the launch.
---
you're missing the point of what I said its okay if you're upset and your experiences comes from nothing but private servers, no need to get tilted my son, you're stuck on the defense for some reason I have no idea, but I guess if you have autism or something that might be your issue.
---
Ehm no, you pay a subscription fee to play retail. Getting access to beta is a bonus. Paying a sub does not mean you get access to beta.  
---
Do you even know what the purpose of a beta is?
---
Demo shout and clap would be better investments than battle shout if you want to dump rage
---
&gt; Your argument makes no sense. People know more about the game and will have an easier time levelling and that'S why it should be staggered to last lnoger than it did at retail? 
---
For one, I never said anything "should" happen, just what Blizz is most likely to do. I'm personally gonna be 60 within a few weeks, you just won't catch me acting surprised when there's little to do other than farm MC for months. Second, it's not longer than retail because retail didn't have a "phase 2". You keep forgetting that honor is in phase 2 which didn't make it into the game until **5** months after release, for everyone. That would be late January 2020. I also played EU, but it's irrelevant. The timing on those patches was totally borked because the game launched later. This time it's worldwide from the get-go. What happened to EU players in 2005 is meaningless. I have addressed it, multiple times. It's no longer 2005.
---
&gt; Dire Maul messing with T1 progression is an absolute non argument as well 
---
That's **Blizzard**'s argument. It's happening for this very reason. You saying it's a non-argument doesn't change the fact that they doing this *because* of what you consider a non-argument. 
---
I think we're just gonna argue in circles forever so we should probably cut it off here, thanks for the civil discourse. I'm not *against* the idea of early P2, I just absolutely don't believe we're gonna see it any sooner than mid-December at the *absolute* earliest, my money's still on January though.
---
As a diablo player, who's never played wow, I vastly underestimated leveling time. (D3 takes under 2 hours to hit max)
---
Also recklesness I believe
---
As someone who played vanilla,
---
NO. 
---
PLEASE NO.
---
No. It smells like Blizzard. 
---
Activision would just give it to you straight at this point. 
---
Blizzard still has pretend that they care.
---
3/4 on the timer in ZA, some in SSC and TK.
---
1. No class fell through the cracks, and in terms of PvP this was the best balanced expansion.  PvE was pretty good.  Got a bit nuts for high-end guilds, but there was a lot of representation in most guilds.  Our ZA team had an ele shaman.
---
2. You're the only person I've ever heard say the rating system was unintuitive for players.  I had no problem with it at all, and the guides out there made it easy for players to figure out how much they needed of what stat.  It was far more interesting than the gearing in Vanilla, and done better than any expansion since.
---
3. Badge gear was generally equivalent to the level of content you got badges from, until late in the expansion.  It mainly served to balance out for those who were unlucky and didn't get the drops.
---
4. Daily quests were optional in TBC.  If you felt like they were a chore, that's on you more than it's on the game.  If you're complaining about the Argent Tournament dailies or how you have to do your World Quests or you lose out on Artifact Power, I'd agree.
---
5. .
---
6. This is just a whiny rant.  Arenas were a blast, there were more than 1 competitive composition for each arena size.  5s were fun if you had a dedicated group.  I much preferred BGs in TBC because I didn't feel like it was a long reputation grind.
---
7. You're complaining about bugged fights when comparing Vanilla to TBC?  Like #6, this comes across as a whiny rant.
---
8. What are you talking about?  Leveling alts was so much better in TBC.  If for no other reason than Paladins could now tank dungeons.  But there are other reasons, like more specs being viable, and huge QOL changes to certain classes.
---
Yeah, game designers never make bad decisions at all! They are always thinking about the player experience and never lose sight of that at all!1
---
That is an utterly absurd comparison. Totally brainless, this is a hugely hyped and advertised release that an existing population gets to try for free. I don't even believe you believe what you've just said
---
In 3 days, everyone will be dispersed sufficiently. It won’t be catastrophic
---
They will. It's like Diablo 2 starting new ladders over and over again, people like to compete over again from the starting line.
---
They increased the loot drop rates **in beta only** to allow testing of items. It won't be in release.
---
You are welcome, consider setting a repeating alarm on your phone or other alarm capable device to re-read this reddit post daily.
---
If the streamers drag people away from the purpose of testing (AV) to go other places, then sure.
---
Really? I can't even find a Vanilla video with them showing. It's driving me up the wall.
---
I've leveled druids a few times now and I can't stand higher level priests. They are easy enough at the lower levels but later on they become impossible to deal with.
---
I don't think they should. Alliance being the better faction is a very Vanilla thing.
---
People commenting here literally don't understand the concept of hybrids. They honestly think their hybrid class should be equally viable at things pure classes do. It's insane. I can't figure out where this comes from.
---
I love this solution and I have advocated for it since like March. People have a weird aversion
---
Silver pine Forest. Has very few quests with level gaps in between them and ALLOT of squandered potential.
---
 Even though I love the barrens I resent how all horde players are funneled thier while levelling.
---
imagine caring this much about vanilla pve lol
---
Do your raid, then spec shadow grind for 300 hours get your mount and then you can spec back to healing for the next week's raid.
---
I really hope you're at least 60 y.o., with comments like that. Otherwise this is super cringe.
---
*bounce, bounce bounce*
---
We all hate layering, and I'm sure, blizzard engineers also don't like it
---
There is just no other way.
---
Putting 90% players in queue is not a solution (even if some players think it is). And overloading servers up to crash is also not a solution.
---
And if you ask me to choose between layering and server merges, I choose layering.
---
They just need to iterate it so that it wouldn't be this noticable.
---
If some streamer could occasionally abuse it, well so. It will generate discussions, but it will be barely affecting regular players.
---
That’s implying that others from that shard you just jumped to aren’t also farming that area for Black Lotus. Everyone who argues these sorts of points seem to be under the impression that things spawn at the exact same time on all layers, which assumes that the previous  harvested on that layer was at the same time as the last time it happened on your home layer, as well as that every layer other than your own is empty and not being farmed. 
---
Is layering too aggressive atm? Absolutely. Is the solution to kill it outright and shove 20k people into starting zones all at once to get that ‘authentic’ private sever style experience? No.
---
I know for alliance there's a quest in Ashenvale that asks you to get venom sacs from them.  Not sure about Horde though.
---
Good call.  I don't think it was the absolute worst, but definitely near the bottom of the list.  However, The Day Deathwing Came was amazing and one of the few old world changes I unequivocally loved!
---
It leads to homogenization and trivializes individual choice. If all classes and specs are more or less equal, there is little meaning behind choosing one or another.
---
I want to mention that if you do get a raid slot as shadow DPS (and some people do), you're going to spend a lot of money on mana-related consumes: mana oil, mageblood potion, mana pots, etc... so it really helps to have a farming alt.
---
&gt; But Alch without Herb seems to be a bit to risky because I would be limited to AH buyouts
---
On the contrary, feeding on the AH is how you make decent money, because there's little time investment per gold earner. If you think of wealth of in terms of gold *as a function of time*, you'll see farming yourself makes no sense.
---
Why not add dynamic respawns? it was blizzlike.  And yes there no crashing or lag on the last big server launch with 12k pop.  literally the only complaint Ive heard was that the dynamic respawn was too aggressive in caves.
---
Blizzard just hire r/ChromedDragon already.
---
I remember that show "Cheat" I believe it was called that had a gnome work her little butt off to get this mount. I also only watched the show strictly for educational purposes... &gt;.&gt;
---
For raids you will be swinging annihilator and then nightfall once there are 3 annihilator stacks.
---

---
I'll tell you where redditors like myself get my info. From the lead game developer. At 3:54 he goes into a break down on the tech and how it's being used.
---
In case you dont watch that, Ion himself stated in the interview the plan was the begin scaling the tech back almost immediately and have it phased out in a few weeks time.
---
In other words, by the time people are actually hitting the Gurubashi arena, this tech will almost certainly be phased out.
---
Nah, that’s shitty game designers making poor decisions who were responsible. 
---
Arena is fun.
---
During classic wow I came across a hunter randomly on the broken reservoir/castle in North Loch Modan... Was from the same village in Northern Ireland
---
No no, Detroit is far worse.
---
Not gonna lie, your comment made my morning. Bah ha ha. :D
---
None. You cant solo any at level 60. You might be able to do certain specific bosses, but not solo entire  max level instances.
---
im on beta and my floating text is not showing healing
---
Hunters, Frost Mages, and Warlocks. Rogues don't scare me because I never see them coming, I just insta-die after fighting a mob and need to check my combat logs to see wtf happened.
---
I know a lot of people hate layering and I don't like it either, but it's necessary for the beginning.  Everyone knows that a bunch of people are going to quit after trying classic for a little.  The amount of people that are going to quit is obviously going to be a lot higher if they spend 5 minutes waiting for a quest mob while everyone is taking it. 
---
Leveling speed will probably be the main reason people quit and without layering it's a lot slower.  If you want as many people to quit, we should be happy with a small amount of layering to avoid release chaos.
---
He means when his rogue is max level.
---
This is why you role human, bonus rep, easier to get tiger!
---
It's an incapacitate.  Similar to sap.
---
Leveling speed will probably be the main reason people quit and without layering it's a lot slower.  If you don't want as many people to quit, we should be happy with a small amount of layering to avoid release chaos.
---
Yes 😑
---
but she isn’t average Joe, she’s literally the villain Blizzard have been prepping for the past 10 years. Her model on the right is better, you see her you don’t relate to her cause you shouldnt. 
---
Those arguments everywhere about being “an average adventurer” works for playable character, not for major leaders and future raid boss
---
Oh wow so dual wielding may be a good option for dps in pve overworld (with 10% bonus). Is slam worth using while dual wielding?
---
I never said that, you're hearing what you want to hear.
---
I really want to do this on a gnome. Does anyone know if I have to be exalted with darnassus and buy tiger riding also. Two different grinds
---
BRILLIANT!
---
Seriously, back in TBC and WotLK, I had my younger brother login to farm rep. I was happy to pay him as it was a great help. I know we're not supposed to share accounts but he's family.
---
Are layers different from phasing? I'm curious because one of the things in most excited about for classic is the fact you will have name recognition and see the same players all the time cause you play on the same server. (Not that I would have recognition lol)
---
There are 500 people playing on peak each faction it seems. Layering is being TESTED. ITS A BETA SERVER.
---
Otherwise the entire server would be on the same layer since the population is low.
---
Like daym. Let them test it.
---
Maybe if you had a different theme, it'd work. There can only be one ooga gang. :P
---
It works, yeah, but it makes players unhappy. Most of them are forced to get name changes which they don't want, or else you get the weird connected realms names, players with the same name. Realms can be split up, guild names might have to change. Just because it's a functional solution doesn't make it the best solution.
---
On beta it's fucky I got it on kill 3. Lots of guildies got it on 1-5. 
---
Some still had the vanilla "150 oozes" luck, but not many. 
---
Hope they fix it
---
Cmon man this has been suggested so many damn times already and blizzard is well aware of the idea.
---
Obviously, I hope this doesn't happen (at least, extremely rarely) in launch.
---
It seems to me this sort of falls into two camps - those who think Blizzard is likely to keep their word (layering for 2-4 weeks til population stabilizes, and in any case no longer than Phase 1) and those who think Blizzard will go back on that word (sorry all, too many playing, Layering sticking around).
---
This makes total sense to me, because each of those situations requires a different response.
---
Layering for 2-4 weeks?  No big deal at all.  I imagine the number of server-wide 60s who are also of the right profession to farm, who are actively doing it, and who have the knowledge and capability to exploit layering is not going to be a huge number of people.
---
Layering past a month, up to P1 end?  More of an issue.  Many more folks will ding 60, and look to move into end game content, which will include farming up for that content.  The knowledge and meta about how to exploit layering will definitely expand and a higher percentage of folks will do it.  Coupled with more 60s, this moves more towards medium to high impact on the servers.  It is mitigated, however, by a much higher number of "natural" farmers - exploiting layering only really works if you can find a layer that isn't farmed which will be much more difficult as more and more people are farming.
---
Layering past P1?  Unmitigated disaster.  Blizzard will have broken their promise and there are good reasons why they made that promise, even outside server economies and other exploitable situations.  For the health of Classic, Blizzard, and our gameplay experience, this would be catastrophic and Blizz can't let it happen (I don't personally feel they will - they seem to understand the gravity of that choice).

Can you ride the mount as horde ?

---
Oh noes, Three times I will have been in trouble for even hinting at p servers.
---
I dare not a THIRD TIME.
---
RIP: Rebirth though. I was on there back in 2012 - 2013
---
I like how none of these comments bitching about arena have to do with the actual arena feature but rather about poor design decisions associated with it.
---
This is very disappointing to see.
---
I think the point is you wouldn't be standing still, you would have to find unique ways to have fun. Not that I think it's a good idea to have a broken first day experience, but there would be some interesting aspects of it.
---
Model-wise, the BfA one is much better. Voice-wise, Vanilla is way way better.
---
layering is being TESTED on the BETA SERVER. Who knew????
---
The population on beta servers are too low to even start a second layer. They are tweaking it manually. Like daym. Chill. Think.
---
I hope the boot Bay times becomes a regular and communal fake publication like the SCP foundation. 
---
Also I just realized that gnomes are better at tainting cities than the forsaken
---
I dont know, why its getting downvoted, its procs are getting affected by spell power making it a best in slot weapon for certain paladin spec
---
Yeah, hunters. If a hunter comes at me I usually just try to kill the pet so at least I can lower its happiness and make the hunter feed it.
---
&gt; Fun fact: if I saw any cheaper ones I would buy them out and post them with my price.
---
Be careful of the 5% AH cut.
---
I’m conflicted. I want to upvote for funny, but I don’t want to signal to Blizzard this is acceptable...
---
Can't wait for 1.14.
---
They could even add some lower level zones with similar quest density and level ranges to normal vanilla zones and add some level 60 zones with maybe some insane grinds for a mount like the Wintersaber, ofcourse again Alliance only for authenticity. Maybe some areas that surve no game mechanic purpose just be there for RP reasons.
---
we would be friends ingame haha 
---
i really appreciate people asking for water or food and wait for me to actually tell them they can trade me if they need sth of the upper :)
---
&gt;The old fashioned way of doing it was just people logging in and not getting anything done. Ask a veteran what they used to do on releases and most said “waiting two weeks to play the game”
---
You weren't around for vanilla launch, were you.  Game rollout was completely different, population grew gradually over weeks as the game became more popular, and I never once saw a crowded starting zone.  Compare that to classic, which has a massive hype train and will see a rapid influx of players on day 1.
---
The only "waiting to play the game" we did back then was dealing with server crashes and rollbacks.
---
Warlock summons = easily abused, no?
---
Yep. I mean, you yourself still wont be doing a whole lot but your big bad red monster will mash them.
---
Not this time. Leveled up in retail classic as a human, 
---
Farthest I made it back then as horde was mid 20’s. I want to see endgame as horde this time.
---
Happened to my bf and I yesterday when he invited me (/invite [name] not right click &gt; invite) as we were playing literally right next to each other in Tarren Mill (and irl) and on the same realm (beta PvE horde). I think his invite went through anyway, that or he typed it again so quickly I didn’t notice.
---
I believe they need a little social pressure to pick a better idea than the one they are currently planning to use. With a decent alternative solution, I hope that the player base opposes sharding in Classic.
---
I smoke this shit called meth
---
JK but I mean it's the horde , why would they have perfectly straight lines and shit ... That's right, they wouldn't cuz horde players aren't straight haha rekt
---
Yeah I hear you.  I'm more of a fan of layering for like a week, then get rid of it.  Even then you'll have people at 60 after a week or shortly after.  I just want people to understand there has to be a compromise somewhere.  I just want a smooth launch, because there are going to be so fucking many people trying classic from retail, and if they login and it's a total dumpster fire, they are already done with classsic day 1.  And I damnit want classic to kill retail!
---
Nice reply.  Real mature.  I just used asmongold as an example on how hard they are trying to get attention from people such as yourself.  
---
Go back to sucking ooga booga's tiny cocks you cum dumpster.
---
That would explain it. I haven't played Alliance much.
---
I am 100% going to grind this out as soon as I am able to.
---
On the Horde side of things, it will be 20 naked orcs and trolls standing around a single cactus apple spawn.
---
Naw just letting you know that you're retarded
---
Like Blizzard have said, I hope layering is just a temporary mechanic.
---
I'd put my wee wee in her voo voo.
---
Couldn't you just hearth to a city, switch, and get a warlock to summon you?
---
I can see how my comment confused you. You might  want to reread it though.
---
You are the on who invoked the Nostalrius numbers. It is not my problem they do not show what you thought they did. You are free to try and make a case for how hype, advertisement and/or a shared subscription make player growth literally impossible, however.
---
&gt; I'm likely never going to do the solo instance runs
---
You'd make way more money farming DM North as a hunter than farming herbs.
---
Oh look another post about layering. Even though we all know it is just a temporary issue that likely won't be around long, we must complain about it daily.
---
But there was supposed to be,  the trainer was there but he never had the quests until later. I don't think anyone would mind if they fixed it this time.
---
this thread reminds me of late vanilla when almost no one ran to dungeons because they'd farmed the shit out of them for months....
---
Thanks, yeah I know it's saturated but why not eh?
---
No sir, my ram is enough for me
---
Why are oceanic players paired with NA realms instead of east Asia?
---
Going on ad hominem rant won't get you anywhere.
---
MC can be done with and a tank that's not defense capped. This is my point. And I base it on my experience in classic wow, on blizzard servers, when classic was current content.
---
A tank in MC BIS is 26 defense short of cap (13 shor when Quel'Serrar procs).
---
Nobody cared about being uncrittable (that's what defense cap is) in Vanilla WoW. You just healed the tank through crits.
---
But feel free to throw more insults at me, I'm sure that'll prove your point.
---
They don't and they can't... He is full of it... Most pserver launches are AWFUL from what I have experienced... *SOME* can handle 12k concurrent players spread across various zones sure... But not 12k on launch in the same 6 starting zones... That's literally 2k people in the same fucking area... NO WAY that is feasible
---
To be quite honest, that's not much of a solution. If an area's level should determine when layering is no longer needed, it would have to be up around 40 or 50 in order for it to make sense. I was frankly surprised to hear them say that layering will only exist in phase 1, because I don't see them being unnecessary by then.
---
Judging by sensible predictions, the prognosis for Classic's launch kind of resembles a DMV office with ten thousand people in line. Cutting layering at level 20 is like solving the DMV's queue problems opening one additional office next to it so that there's only five thousand in line for each. Technically a huge improvement over permanent layers which nobody wants, but it's still not a particularly satisfying result. Like I mentioned, the point where an absence of layering will no longer lead to crippling overpopulation is likely near 50.
---
Layering is an alternative to opening a billion servers and doing messy, overdue mergers down the line. In order for layering to be preferable over that, it has to result in a better situation. If it's there only for the very first levels and then completely gone, it's never going to be a better situation than more servers with tenable populations that may one day need to be merged with other servers.
---
I'm going to promise to *try*. I don't want or need it ASAP but if I truly have nothing else I'd rather be playing/doing, why not?
---
I've grinded for longer to get things in other MMOs. It's just a matter of time.
---
Okay, shouldn't we be more controlling then? Set limits on peoples consumption of fastfood, refined sugar and ban alcohol and smoking outright!
---
Of course it exists, because it's the modern server infrastructure. Just because it exists doesn't mean it's turned on, or going to be turned on in the live product.
---
Early on in the beta people saw players from the private Friends and Family beta realm on the public beta realm.

So you ***are*** a sperg? 
---
What is a sperg anyway? I've seen this term thrown around alot lately. To me just looks like something edgy neckberds are saying to attempt to shit on less edgy neckbeards.
---
There’s no reason for layering to exist out of the starter zones, period.
---
Afaik, your solution is what the devs want layering to be.
---
Because during the initial layering phase, they'll pick a bunch of mats and hoard them.  Then when server populations have dropped down and layering is gone, you now have an economy with a single server's size population but the farmed mats from what is effectively many server's worth of nodes.
---
I hope that made sense.
---
Given a long enough time, it will balance out in the wash, but it'll be unusual for awhile.
---
I prefer Stormwind myself as well. IF looks cool and all but navigating it is meh.

I mean it's right below hunter/lock speedwise. Travel form!
---
It saves on bandwidth and server costs.  Basically, they want it to be as close to single player as possible.  coughgarrisons
---
Damn, I already went through this once...
---
Why is the warrior prot bis full of +defense items?
---
I would only hang out in Stormwind to kill alliance scum.
---
Good, it's completely optional and reduces the need to copy/paste a discord link
---
What you just described is layering, except: 1) the layering doesn't happen in the background, and 2) layering is more flexible (in that it will be able to fix imbalances on the fly).
---
I think we are seeing a lot of bugs in beta. Layering, if working as intended, is clustering -- it just moves people around more in real time.
---
Desolace is brutal because it’s the level range before you get a mount and unless your class has a speed buff, it’s a ton of walking
---
[SM/Ruin](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IE0bhRbkAZZgx0tM0z) is what he's talking about, one of the standard raiding builds for lock at 60. It's one of the few (possibly only?) spec in 1.12.1 which is extremely viable for both raiding and PvP at the same time. That con about spec bouncing should definitely be taken off of OP's list!
---
Just as interactive, too. In both, you're watching other people do everything.

Would love to see the offspecs. Boomkin, ret, enhance and prot pally

Nothing average joe about her. She was a Ranger General, She did so well against the scourge, Arthas changed her into a banshee as a "reward". She was strong enough to break free from him.
---
She is basically a high level character just like every other well equipped player that you see in any city. She's done just as much with far less farming.
---
That's why you have battlegroups, which minimizes the chance for forced name changes.

the truth can hurt, I understand that

Have a good life hun 😂👍

I’d prefer having to wait for spawns than this shit honestly, I would play retail if I wanted any of this shit.

---
While I agree with you on that, I have to say any solution they come up with is going to feel very over-engineered in the face of simply turning off layering sooner rather than later.
---
Prot paladins and feral druids where always, meant to tank. They just fucked the balacing in vanilla. Why els would there be a PROTECTION spec and druid having several abilities close to warrior. In tbc warrior drue and paladins tanked very diffrently and had therecown niche. I personalet find this the Best tank Meta. Warrior was King and versitile and had monster angro and mitigation. Druid where healthpool sponges and with there dogde they where the kings if tankning the big hitters. While paladins had to manage there mana for mitigation and where the solo kings of tankning 100 mobs at the same time. God forbid us from wanting variety gameplay.
---
Yeah, her model is great and the voice actress is awesome.
---
It may seems more elegant (I think not tho) but this version basically gives nothing more to old version where dead servers got merged, only we know which ones will it be. If not the Bloodmoon 2, 3, 4 will stay standalone while BM 1, 5 etc will be merged give the others stay healthy. Seems unprofessional to me to have replica servers.
---
2 months
---
You mean when they remove the 7,000th layering thread for the day because it could have just been a comment in one of the other 6,999 than it's own thread?
---
Gonna have to side with the mods on this one...
---
You literally just described server merges. That's part of what layering is trying to prevent. Your solution is the problem.
---
For some of you, it'll be Redridge.
---
Because if you have 5 layers on a server there is 5 times as many of every resource, whereas server population isn't affected by the number of layers.
---
Layering can also be taken advantage of to make farming these resources safer and faster.
---
Surprised this hasn't been removed by the nazi mods here.
---
Did you actually read the reason that the mod put in the post?       
---
"Post in one of the multiple threads already existing on the subject"
---
Lol for our guild now we're actually getting custom esports jerseys made =D. Hopefully the people that get them get together at blizzcon or something this year or next =D.
---
This looks awesome
---
Mathematically one-handed weapons deal about 75% (76.something%) the damage two-handed weapons do, and let you use a shield which will practically double your armor rating and lets you block to boot. Once you hit level 40, Shield Slam is actually also not that bad compared to Mortal Strike; in the average leveling spec it will deal about 75% of the damage that Mortal Strike does, but costs less rage.
---
I'm thinking of leveling as Prot in Classic because I like the sword&amp;board aesthetic, and after mulling over the numbers I've become convinced that the feeling of 2H specs dealing way more damage is mostly just a feeling (until you hit level 60 and start optimizing your gear).
---
except you will only find OP there lmao, everyone else is in IF
---
You mentioned Isle of Quel'Danas, that's a perfect example of why people hate flying mounts. I assume you're familiar with what that place was like. Until Quel'Danas was released, nothing else offered that kind of player environment, which was extremely reminiscent of classic wow. It wasn't even about the World PVP. I played on a PVE server during that time and something about the Isle I really enjoyed.
---
What was the one thing that made the Isle unique besides the new content? You couldn't fly. It's definitely not the end of the discussion, but it's a pretty good case for seeing how flying affects the game overall.
---
Well, I guess the idea is that layering will basically do this automatically.
---
Now, whether or not this is a situation of "just because you can doesn't mean you should" on Blizzard's part is yet to be seen...
---
What rule was that that was broken?
---
A bunch of people decide to start creating anti-layering threads all at once, yeah that's brigading or at the very least spam. Of course they're going to remove that.
---
We need more posts like this, you understand the problem they're trying to solve with layering and offer an alternative solution instead of just complaining about it.
---
Another benefit to the server cluster solution is that it accounts for the case where the exodus of tourists is less than expected. Suppose that once the population stabilizes Illidan 1-5 have enough people left for two servers of healthy population rather than the expected one. You can merge them into 2, keep Illidan 1 as Illidan and give Illidan 2 a new name before decoupling them, leaving two servers. With the layering solution you would need to either keep layering or have an overpopulated server.
---
there were 3-4 tanks in most raids, as long as you show up on time and don't fall asleep before the boss pull you should be fine, our main tank in vanilla would nod off on Rag every time
---
&gt;Because if you have 5 layers on a server there is 5 times as many of every resource, whereas server population isn't affected by the number of layers.
---
That logic only works if you assume that the extra layers will be active despite there not being enough population for them but that's not how the system works.
---
I grinded that once and by hell I'm going to do it again. Hell that is still my goto land mount to this day.
---
I would have said the whole party in a capital city,  for everyone to be merged together, but it may be unpractical for legits groups I guess
---
Make layering level based. 1-19 has as many layers as necessary, 20-60 is always one layer. Low level areas aren't nearly as exploitable and world PvP shouldn't be affected as it doesn't begin to be a factor until you're in the 20's. If a level 15 invites a 60, then the 15 is moved to the 60 layer.
---
cept they arent in pvp
---
No, right now you just sign up to one server let's say Dragontooth. Then you don't know what layer you're on, and it might be different from day to day, your friends might not be on your layer and so on
---
There is always the choice of grouping with people and try harder content if you don't want to farm mobs or wait for respawns or level professions (which you will need to kill mobs to get to the herbs/ores or skinning dead mobs, and killing mobs gives you exp!).
---
\+1 was a little sad not seeing it :(
---
Love it
---
What rule was broken?
---
Honestly, some of the threads are so far beyond pants-on-head-retarded that mods might be confusing them for trolls.
---
You don’t need to be an expert to see that the experience/gameplay isn’t great.... you need to play the game to see it?? Why tf do you think the great experts are Blizz beta test their game?? You’re just another ignorant hater.
---
You do realise that layering on beta is just being tested? The amount of players on the beta server isn't even 1/3rd of how many players there actually will be on a layer.
---
Try this with 2-3 layers on a server with 9k players online with 100s of people on all layers trying to get it. Hopping between layers won't do shit for you.
---
the race between private and guilds such as these is going to be interesting.  Both are going to no life the crap outta this.   The path is fairly straight forward.  Theory crafting anyone can figure out.  This being said, I give the edge to private servers.  they know the instances inside and out.  Where as method, unless they all start practicing on a private server, do not.
---
It will be tight and will be interesting to see who gets the Classic first.
---
Clusters would be like Vanilla. You'd always log on to the same server with the same people. You would get to know the people on your server. Eventually, after a few weeks or a month, there would be one painful moment when a big influx of strangers joined.
---
Layering is a mega server with an incredible amount of people who will share the same continent on Monday and then not see each other again for weeks or months. Because of the state of flux of all things, it will likely create a sense of always being amongst strangers. For example, that Mage who gave you intellect yesterday is questing in Wetlands today and so are you. He:
---
* would be someone you see again and group up with to do some quests
---
or
---
* would not be someone you see again for weeks
---
Can someone explain what this is?  I've never leveled as Alliance.  I will be making a Gnome.  Is this a mount I can obtain?  And how?
---
Bgs are phase 3, the honor system is p2, but is only wpvp
---
I don't know why this is such an unpopular opinion with people. They say they want the full classic experience of fight for spawns, but if they made shards the right size you could still fight for spawns, but still have content that was doable. Launch day is just going to be such a custer fuck and I'm not sure why people want that. 
---
We're talking an average of 500 people in each starting zone at 3PM PST on August 26. Sounds like aids to me. I'd rather be fighting against 50 people so I could still play the game.
---
Is it being tested or are they planning on actually running like this. That's the problem, Blizz needs to clarifying what is going on, because if the game plays like how it's playing in beta, the whole game is DOA.
---
If Blizz came out and told everybody to chill out and that the devs are just running some experiments against the beta population, that would be a huge step in the right direction.
---
That would really only be true if the competition for resources doesn't go up with the overall player count but that's basically impossible.

People told me to learn the professsion so called "enchanting" and learn the "beastslaying" recipe.
---
That enough was a fucking mystery, my English was complete garbage back then as well. 😂
---
However, i finally managed to learn the professsion and I needed some kind of "Rod" to be able to Enchant it. I bought the rod of the vendor and start clicking on it in my bags to try apply it on my weapon, hahaha..

I mean, I think it's reasonable that people are concerned.  We want to avoid what you're talking about.
---
That said, it IS a beta and layering is one of the new features.  It makes sense they'd test different configurations of it.
---
I think the main issue is this sub seems to only select 1 (Blizzard is a saint) or 10 (Classic is DOOMED) as it it's outrage level, where a 4-6 is probably more appropriate in this case.
---
you are a stupid noob who dident even believe me when I told you heroicstrike is better than sunder. Very clearly YOU don't understand how tanking work in vanilla
---
Thanks! I figured you weren't intending to come off that way, but sometimes it's hard to tell with text!
---
Yeah, I figured the miss chance is really not that high, but a lot of my attacks are missing. I'd change up my weapon upgrade path but honestly in a starting zone you don't exactly have a lot of options. (And of course on the ps scene you can't do the Relics of Wakening quest worth a damn even in a five man group, so I had to skip that one for my sanity.)
---
If nothing misses for me, I can kill stuff before it reaches me, and/or raptor strike once or twice and it's dead. If stuff misses, especially Arcane Shot (or Concussive, rip) then it's a challenge because that's where most of my damage comes from. 
---
I was probably exaggerating a little, but some mobs are a lot harder to kill than others; the shambling elemental guys and higher leveled spiders are the tough ones; no real issues with nightsabers/boars/etc. Harpies are fine too, except the ones that heal themselves with one of their melee moves... 
---
Back in the day I had a swing timer; I'm sure it makes a difference, but I can't imagine it's a big one? I'll play with it tonight and see if I can do better. Right now I'm sitting at level 9 with no quests I can do safely (I'm not touching that relics quest; it's been vile on every night elf alt), but I have no issue trying to grind it out. It'll be good practice.
---
I'm kind of thinking on Classic release grinding levels might be easier than dealing with some of the quests, at least in that zone.
---
They camp occasionally to make people think they're gonna camp you if they kill you once
---
Yeah, they were meant to tank, and they could tank.
---
They just couldn't tank as good as warriors. And they were never meant to.

They are hybrids.

Hey sorry I mostly check this at work. Something like a 5-10 minute buffer period before any form of crafting nodes phase in would probably work.
---
&gt; and it might be different from day to day
---
Do you know this for certain?        
---
I figured the devs would be smart enough to lock you into a layer when you make the character and all characters after the first one.
---
Still have mine. No lighting, but it was solid until I stopped playing and later got a mechanical kb. May have to dust it off.
---
5man questing sucks. Its good if you spam dungeons with the right classes and will give very fast xp
---
Itty Bitty Rogue Committee!
---
You too, sperg.
---
&gt; you're one of his spergs
---
---------------------------
---
&gt; What is a sperg anyway?
---
&gt; Have a good life hun 😂👍

---
You're good at this aren't you?
---
What talent is missing in BFA? What
---
That's going to be the best part of Classic.
---
&gt;Open the layering gate!
---
&gt;Close the layering gate!
---
If "True fans" abandon The only true WoW Classic for that reason then good riddance. 
---
Layering is not perfect but it is the only sensible solution to prevent fully packed starter zones which can expand the time spent there to +3 hours if you are unlucky (Nost was the best example for that)
---
I am sure that they will find a way to prevent exploits like that, it's still almost 3 months until release and they seem to be genuinely wanting to make it a good experience.
---
If they can't fix it then I will just accept it for the few weeks where layering will be around.
---
Hey Djules, are you going to quit BDO for WoW? And will you stream it? I didnt expect to see you here.
---
I was, excel sheet all the way.
---
They may appear on heals your character receives, but I think op is referring to when you heal other friendlies.
---
speak for yourself I’m special AF
---
No. If you have this mount unlocked on Alliance, it becomes a Venomhide Ravasaur for your Horde characters. If you do the Venomhide quests first, it will automatically reward you with the Winterspring Frostsaber too.
---
If you look at racial yea, but Alliance has paladins. In WSG Alliance hes BoF horde doesn't. 
---
AV and AB have Alliance favored layouts. 
---
The guards in Stormwind Keep are elite, Thralls guards the Kor Kron "elites" are not elite.
---
Which city gives Rend / Ony / Neff buffs?
---
 (I’m Horde and don’t know)...
---
Whichever city you can stand in and possibly get buffed is the one I’m going to be in. 
---
(Orgrimmar for the win)
---
Lol what narrative? Are you implying they're deleting all anti-layering topics? Because a layering topic is literally third on hot
---
Remove the foil hat and get some fresh air, man
---
&gt; and then not see each other again for weeks or months
---
Has the devs said anything about this though?      
---
As in confirming or denying it's going to be like that.
---
This is very interesting. I found out, that geared 60 prot warrior actually slices through NPCs like its nothing, however I was skeptical about leveling. I got one very old 22lvl warrior on one pserver, I guess I will give him a visit and ll try to level up to 45-50 to check it out
---
Several but it’s ok we know why you’re here now, to start trouble.  If it was to have a valid discussion about layering you’d do it in one of the 7000 pre-existing threads.
---
Tree fiddy
---
Because it's one of the highlights of phase 1 according to Blizzard, hence being a phase highlight logo.
---
Sorry, but I do not understand what you are trying to say. It seems like you are somehow arguing against the proposed solution. Could you please explain?
---
16 was in vanilla after some patches, definitely before 1.12
---
Are you missing Stage 1 raid BiS? You have Stage 1 pre-raid but no raid, but Stage 2 pre-raid and Stage 2 raid.
---
Stage 2 raid BiS appears to have items not attainable in Stage 1 - for example, I believe Rhok'delar won't be available until Stage 2, but MC is available Stage 1. Is there a better BiS weapon between Dwarven Hand Cannon and Rhok'delar?
---
We, as a society, put a lot of big "prevention" on both alcohol and drugs already. Short of making it illegal..... oh wait we tried that ... as you can see some things are NOT easily or at all preventable ...
---
Reposts/spam, take your pick
---
Seriously, the new one is 100000% better. The first one is essentially a placeholder that they let stay in the game for far too long. Replacing a few choice models (like this one and maybe the other high elves who exist in game) with the first iteration of their remodels would be totally fine with me.
---
That is really great work yet again. I don't think setting up shop in a boxed in bay whose mouth is watched closely by Stormwind would be a particularly good idea for the pirate's of Corsair's refuge. Booty Bay is a sufficient Pirate Hub for the Southern part of the Eastern Kingdoms,
---
I'm not brushed up on the lore, but I also assume the humans of Stormwind didn't always travel to Ironforge through Dark Iron lands or through Menethil Harbor. Dwarven ruins on the Frostmane shore and what's left of a bridge could be nice additions.
---
Keep up the good work!
---
pvp orc
---
pve trolls - because of berz, but on end game berz will be not helping so only ORCS!
---
ye cuz they have atleast 4x the pop of a retail vanilla server
---
You can see if the size thing is an issue by leveling to 20 and running some bgs as ftp in retail.
---
Aside from a few obvious negatives, like flying which one could dismiss as experimental at the time, it felt like the logical next step for the game. A lot of the magic that made Vanilla special was still there while still evolving the game.
---
Myself and a few people in our guild have been having an issue with being dismounted midflight when changing zones. 
---
We get the message:
---
All players must be in the same realm to enter[kalimdor/eastern kingsom]

This is followed by a frame skip and falling hopefully not to your death.

2 nickels and a piece of half chewed bubble gum
---
Then it loses the vaunted ability to regulate population on the fly.
---
everything? no. well scaling mage damage in late content stages is definately a factor.
---
i was specifically replying to the first part of your sentence.
---
True, but there's something to be said about the consistency of Vanilla graphics. The original Sylvanas model is good in that it fits within the context. I like that. The new Sylvanas looks better, sure, but stands out when placed beside art assets from 2004, or when compared to the potato-faced player character.
---
The same phenomenon occurs when you mix old and new armour pieces while transmogging - the juxtaposition looks bad. The graphical inconsistencies in the modern game are part of what makes the experience feel janky and disjointed imo, which is why I prefer the old game and the old models.
---
So... much... silk...
---
mage wand is wrong for some tiers (there are better wands than bonecreeper stylus in bwl and aq)
---
I’d prefer original visuals in most cases but in case like this where the original model was basically a placeholder I prefer they went with a newer model.
---
Not much. 10 bucks or something they were very common for people to buy when they first got into the game
---
I'd actually say there's way, way more assholes in the Classic community.
---
But I'd rather play with a bunch of angry assholes who are good at the game than a bunch of spoiled, entitled whining manchildren who get everything they want and *still* can't play the game properly, even though they're "nicer people". Nicer people wasting my goddamn time is what they are.

I am not sure children are physically or mentally capable of staying awake for that long before simply falling asleep. Adults on the other hand .... that is who I am worried about.

Or the chest on the Roof Inn the theramor keep
---
They are kooler with a big 2h axe
---
Very little dude.
---
Then you need to deal with the problem that there are warlocks summons in the game so it can still be expoilted. Maybe disable summons for 30 min after switching layers or something. 
---
Another problem is that it's not very convenient if everytime your buddies log on you need to get one of you to the inn if you are in the world somewhere. Also how would you know which player(s) will switch layers and needs to be at the in?
---
I hope there is a more elegant solution but I can't think of one.
---
There could also be a dungeon on the speedrun tram. Kind of „the abandoned tram trail, abandoned because infested by troggs etc.“
---
he did but aq patch was before 1.12 
---
classic will be 1.12 balance, but release the content in phases instead of releasing all content on launch
---
Chuck Norris CAN believe it's not butter.
---
It's going to be really hard for me to deal sufficient damage to Rag with all that healing gear on my Ret Paladin.
---
As i understood it, that's not what layering is for though.     
---
It was meant to just let people choose their servers and then not end up on a dead server after tourists leave, if enough people on certain layers leave, they get merged and so on until there's only the main server left.
---
Silithus was literally unfinished wasn’t it? I don’t remember ever bothering to go there before AQ
---
It starts feeling that these layerdudes are flatEarthers of Azeroth.
---
Can someone please explain to me what layering is? I don't remember this from classic
---
To most of your questions: no. You can switch to battle stance for overpower, however. 
---
For most aoe situations you'll be using shouts and cleave.
---
Watch out, truth begets the red arrow
---
I’ll probably try out all of the layers.
---
Bit late to the party but I'm going gnome mage too. t3 actually looks pretty sick on gnomes
---
I am not sure how you came up with that conclusion. May you be so kind and demonstrate your train of though for the rest of us.
---
Thank you.
---
Plus he mentioned it in one of his AB runs too.
---
That's a great point. Clusters would seem to offer a more flexible solution.  I'll add to the OP that layering is not going to be so easy to dispose of once it's implemented if the population never gets low enough.
---
not interested, thank you.
---
Layer
---
Nice nice .. honestly I can't wait to be a layer tourist - picking and choosing which one suits me the best. 
---
I'll just warp to another layer if i'm getting ganked too much.
---
As others described, I don't think you fully understand the point of layering.
---
Less server infrastructure by cramming people into layers of the same server. 9000 people on one server on 3 layers of 3000 each is cheaper than 3 separate servers with 3000 people each. 1 sever = $ and 3 servers = $$$
---
Of course they could just allow 9000 people to play on one server with no layering but then were back to the problem of over congestion in zones.  
---
They're trying to find a fix for congestion without investing in more server infrastructure, so this is mainly a cost saving thing for them. If servers were free they could have an infinite amount of servers at 3000 pop cap each and no layering at all.
---
The problem is you're describing it as a solution, when it is in fact the very problem the current solution intends to fix. Being stuck on one layer that eventually merges with other layers full of people I haven't met before is identical to just having tons of 3k pop servers from the get-go that merge as they die. People don't want that. I don't want to wake up one day and suddenly my server is 60% people I've never seen before.
---
Inns and maybe even entrances to dungeons should also be fine imo. 
---
But re-logging definitely also has to be taken into account. Either the way you proposed: a timer that remembers the player and keeps him/her in the layer; or manipulate the nodes in a way that they cannot be harvested with layer hopping.
---
Wish WoW was moddable like Skyrim so we could have people make cool zones like that.
---
I never liked the Badlands beyond Uldaman. It was a whole lot of nothing and marked a weird point in Dwarf/Gnome questing where you’re probably not gonna wanna go back there to quest at that level.
---
Use the 7000 layering threads.  Stop this brigading nonsense.
---
There are still only a limited number of resources that match the number of players playing...
---
If it didn't then the layers wouldn't be there.
---
Lets say 1000 people per layer. If there are 2000 people playing, you could theoretically get twice as many black lotus by hopping layers. However that is still the same number of lotus per player as in 1 layer. It's irrelevant.
---
Shield slam has the highest raw threat number. I didnt say that it was i run dw/defiance so i use BT over ss. But Revenge when possible, HS always and sunder are the main three if you are going for high threat. But Shield slam if you look it up has the highest Threat number in the game. It has insane snap threat capabilities. So make sure you do your research on threat raw threat numbers. Because Shield Slam has the highest raw threat number in the game.
---
I love this. My guild is doing something similar. I'm the paladin tank and my brother is the warrior tank. I'm hoping it works out.
---
Hunters and grinding go together like carrots and peas.
---
On the bright side, maybe it will make rare things cheaper, allowing me to get those devilsaur items early on cheaply.
---
Closing these threads isn’t enough the mods need to start banning these brigading trolls.
---
As a warlock mostly rogues, pallies and warriors specially pre death coil. Now if I roll orc it will make it less of a pain to deal with them but i'm not sure if I can pass up the undead animations.
---
I think when it comes to grinding, first it all comes down to if the player is having any fun while going through it. And second, how the player values the reward at the end of the grind.
---
... So whether I get to play with my friends on certain days is pot luck? What the fuck kind of "solution" is that?
---
The irony eh?
---
We all had shit ping in 2005.  You’ll be fine.
---
Ah, the Leggings of Eternal guardian... 
---
The time passes by and they are still in there, causing excruciating pain for any decent tank player to see.
---
Nevertheless, good concept and doing this for the sake of community (aka not trying to monetize it) deserves respect.
---
That's different to how it would be on one layer, how?
---
Just switch your reddit layer bro, it's easy.
---
I don't like the new content, but definitely the right. The art is fine (though weirdly thick and blocky that they've claimed as their 'style').
---
That model was uniquely designed for her. I'm not going to blindly dry hump everything Vanilla because its Vanilla. As someone said, its the gameplay that went to shit. Too much QoL dumped on our heads that ruined it.
---
I can tell you our guild won't have issues filling raids :). Maybe you will!

The classic one by far.

Honestly neither. I have always felt the faction leader should look like the player race. Sylvanas ahould look way more undead/rotted. At least the model on the right looks slightly undead but it could be better.

Although the gaming industry pays less than working at a bank, working for a gaming company, especially Blizzard, is a much more desired position, and you'd be kidding yourself to think there isn't competition for working there.
---
FUCK OFF WITH THIS SHIT IT'S SO BORING
---
I guess so cause I hit 60 in vanilla, worked at it stayed up for quite a few 48 hour sessions in my day young whipper snapper
---
Phasing will be phased out by that time.
---
Rare mobs, devilsaur, certain farms you just grind mobs and can instantly respawn them by hopping layers. This wouldn't fix it completely.
---
So glad this is getting mass exposure. Would be an absolute tragedy is Blizz put all the effort they have into making this game and ruining it with the same system that has directly led to the ruin of the current game.
---
How would "not giving a shit" about people around me will make a world a better place? Isn't the exact opposite true? By helping each other we make this a better place to be?
---
That box what sold very cheap for a very long time. It's not worth much
---
I sincerely hope it doesn’t come to this. I (and most other) private server players just want to play a faithful representation of one of the best games ever. Money is not an issue (indeed morally I would like to pay). But the sharding / layering situation reeks of corporate obfuscation &amp; BS.
---
When does illegality and 500ms ping become preferable to a polished blizzard experience? If anything will give cause to seriously consider this question, it’s seeing folks fade out before them and other shard malarkey.
---
 Winterspring Frostsaber Information: [https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=14&amp;t=894](https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=14&amp;t=894) 
---
I did the calculation for how many mobs you would need to kill to go from Neutral to 4500. At a 20% Drop rate, you're looking at around 4100 mobs as a human or 4500 mobs as any other race just to get to the second quest. So Good Luck.
---
Sort of. Although that is still the exact same number of resource spawns per player. Half empty layers would slightly skew it upward.
---
Certainly more memorable than looking at other players pop in and out from space time lol.
---
That's gonna be a "REEEEEEEEEEE" from me, dawg.      
---
I'm pretty stoked on the idea of Classic, but at this rate I may end up waiting to resub for it until they PROVE that they're going to remove sharding permanently from the product.        
---
          
---
"Oh it's only going to be in for the first two weeks!" Sweet, then I'll start playing *after* those first two weeks, then. That way if that shit's still in, I haven't give them any money for it and I can avoid boosting sub numbers due to a bamboozle.
---
My brothers first job out of college paid 150k as an engineer and blizzard pays 60k. Fucking LOL what why would he or anyone else choose a company that pays so badly
---
What could they offer to make him take 1/3 the salary
---
Concerning Warrior Tank:
---
* Stat weights seem off. I get that you're only considering defensive stats, but look at...
---
* S5 rings: [Heavy Dark Iron Ring](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18879) (listed)  vs.  [Signet Ring of the Bronze Dragonflight](https://classicdb.ch/?item=21200)  (exalted) is 110 armor vs +2 Def and +4 Stam (completely disregarding the 13 Str). I think armor is way(yyy) overvalued.
---
* Please reconsider the [Demon's Blood](https://classicdb.ch/?item=10779) trinket for PRS1-PRS2. Alternatives could be [Mark of the Chosen](https://classicdb.ch/?item=17774), or [Counterattack Lodestone](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18537) for PRS2 (assuming Blackhand's Breath and HoJ are not eligible)
---
* Considering the other decisions, I am confused to see [Mirah's Song](https://classicdb.ch/?item=15806) as PRS2, since [Timeworn Mace](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18376) is way more defensive and generally comparable, even has armor on it. Same with S3 [Chromatically Tempered Sword](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19352) vs [Spineshatter](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19335) 
---
* The S6 shield [Shield of Condemnation](https://classicdb.ch/?item=22819) apparently had its values changed in early 2007 to the ones listed in classicdb. wowwiki versions from 2006 [(Link)](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Shield_of_Condemnation?oldid=374257) list it @ 3425 armor, 68 block, which brings it more in line with [The Face of Death](https://classicdb.ch/?item=23043) (which makes sense, since one drops off KT, one off Sapph). See also [twinhead](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?issue=11563).
---
I'm pretty sure you aren't making sense to anyone other than yourself in this thread. If you have a point with this whole "layering saves them money" you are explaining it so terrible I can only assume that you're trolling or dumb.
---
wtf? Why does America suck so much and why do we all still live here?
---
We should look like dog shit compared to the legendary heroes of Azeroth though. Ask yourself how many toons it takes to down a leader of a capital city like Thrall or Sylvanas and use that number to generate how many times cooler they can look than ourselves.
---
I have not heard that AB has an alliance favoured layout before. How does it favour alliance?
---
I don't see how competition effects it at all.  It's a closed system.  There will be X black lotus available to all players.  Who holds them is irrelevant.  When you reach the point that layering is removed, and count the number of picked Black Lotus on the entire server (we'll call that number X), then under the described situation, X will be much higher than a server that never had layering.  But the population will be closer to a population of a server that never had layering.  Over a long enough period of time, this difference will wash out, but at that exact moment, the amount of black lotus in existence on that server will be much different from what it would have been without layering.
---
EDIT: I should also add that I'm assuming that black lotus farmers while layering is still in the game are dedicated enough that they won't just quit without selling/trading the lotus they have collected first.
---
And then we get back to the issue of having ten thousand people crammed into Northshire Abby on launch day.
---
&gt; unique, hilarious, and unrepeatable experience
---
Unique like, omg, remember when we had laying, and APES layer hopped to farm devilsaurs? WHat a shit show.
---
Is it possible to list the formulas you are using for calculations? It’d be also great to be able to tweak them (for PvP for example)
---
I'm so confused about layering. I thought the point was that when you where on a layer, that's it, new players logging in go to the next layer until it's full, and the next and so on;
---
Player 1 &gt; Layer 1
---
Player 2 &gt; Layer 1
---
Player 3 &gt; Layer 2 if layer one is full
---
Player 1/2 relogs, still on layer 1
---
Player 3 relogs, still on layer 2
---
As it stands this is literally sharding
---
Appreciate being invited to groups makes this more challenging but surely something can be done around respawn timers and making things unlootable to avoid what happens in this clip?
---
Fortunately if blizz follows through with the whole "this is only for the early stages of release" then it should go away come level 15 or so...but if it goes on any longer than the first week then it's gonna cause serious issues.
---
Before people go "ITS A BETA LET THEM FIX IT BLERRGH" - I know its a beta, I know what a beta is, however I am allowed to share my thoughts constructively to promote discussion
---
first ever metal gig i went to when i moved to my city i wore an Adabroc tshirt and a Saor hoodie.  A guy taps me on the shoulder and I turn to face him.  He says that he likes Saor.  He then notices the tshirt and says "hey, that's my band!"  
---
his band?  a 1-man project from some little island way up north in Scotland.  I was the first person he'd ever met that was wearing 1 of his tshirts (bearing in mind he probably has like... 100 fans worldwide).  At the first gig I'd gone to when I moved here.
---
I was speechless and totally fangirled him, and added him on facebook.  He posted saying how excited he was to finally meet a fan haha.  I met the actual headline band from the show that night and i was way less hyped to speak to them!
---
Yep, I anticipated such smart-ass reply, and that's the reason I added "y.o." after 60))
---
&gt; Or do I just maintain Max Sunders,
---
Don't just maintain them. Use Sunder constantly. It generates lots of threat. Priority is Shield Slam &gt; Revenge &gt; Sunder while keeping up Shield Block at all times. This often works out to a rotation of Shield Slam -&gt; Revenge -&gt; Sunder -&gt; Sunder.
---
I care, and I am not telling anyone when to go to bed. I am simply asking to put a restriction to prevent self harming behavior.
---
I love getting my grind on in Shimmering Flats!
---
Rewarding grinds is great.
---
That is not how a civilized society works.
---
Explore for exp then.
---
SW. This guy gets it.
---
If there weren't too many horde around it was a great zone for grinding as ally. You could easily spend a decent few levels there without leaving if you stocked up on food etc.
---
What does more damage as solo pve and in PvP? Ret Paladin or Shadow Priest?
---
I'm also subbed to retail (I used in-game gold to buy game time). While working towards the Horde Allied races last night I thought on why it felt wrong.
---
In BfA there's a limited amount of reputation I can reasonably grind each day by doing WQ's. I *can* grind past that level but only at extremely low efficiency. Which means I can't really set myself a goal of unlocking an Allied race and then work steadily towards it. I am forced to stop working towards my goal after about 30-45 minutes.
---
In Vanilla/Classic I can set a goal for the evening's play ("Grind as much Argent Dawn rep as possible") and do that all evening. At the end of the evening I have accomplished my goal ("Grind as much Argent Dawn rep as possible").
---
BfA actively prevents me from achieving my goal.
---
Did you speak to him in game ?
---
If you read the usernames, you have multiple people trying to understand your point. If nobody can understand you, maybe you aren't making sense.
---
Fuck Felix and his bolts, box and bullshit!
---
It’s not yours or Blizzard’s place to tell people how to live their life.  You, nor Blizzard has absolutely no right to do that.
---
So again, mind your own damn business.
---
them's fightin' words
---
A lot of people in this post agree with me so what you are saying is false
---
horde, so no
---
I have a degree in this and have no idea where you’re coming from
---
There is a lot of running but at least XR is pretty central. Then you have zones like Desolace or Hinterlands where the only Horde settlement is way off in a corner.
---
I’m doing it twice
---
Sure, i will happily let morons be morons.
---
Why not just add more servers?
---
even if they try, they would fail anyway
---
Good luck abusing devilsuars or lotus in the first few days of release. That's the only time layering will be incorporated

layering covers the whole continent.  It was implemented as opposed to sharding so when you're playing you'd have a consistent world to play in unless you partied with someone on a different layer.

There absolutely has to be someone coordinating the constant retarded layering posts today, right?

25 people waiting for a 5 minute respawn, limited drops, etc also kills the purpose of most quests. If you've ever played a high populated private server, you'd have wished you had layering for leveling at the beginning. And no, it doesn't get better after level 10.
---
Don't know why you're getting downvoted, but I agree that everyone is freaking out over something that will likely be nothing more than a small blip in phase one.
---
Don't worry, the mods won't consider this a repost, misinformation or trolling 🤓
---
No. We'll be playing PVP.
---
The population issues would be worse than just finding a clean solution to layering abuse.
---
Or have a massive cooldown like 24+ hours for switching layers.
---
Because then they have to merge them again when the tourists leave.
---
So layering saves money because it reduces server merges, yet you have no idea how fast or slowly the servers will die. All we have is past experience. And past experience says that blizzard rarely merges servers. So they designed a whole new way of doing something and are testing it out and implementing it to save money on something, in your own words, they rarely do. Is that your argument?
---
I really can't decide between hunter and shaman,  I absolutely love the play style for both. As a shaman I would be ele but use the hybrid spec so that I can heal the PvE side of things. I would probably be a semi casual player.
---
Which of the two is more populated?
---
How does ele do without amazing gear? Is there PvP set good?
---
Which would gear faster? I know that a lot more shaman are taken to a raid, but that means a lot more competition for the stuff that drops. Whereas with hunter less are taken, but that means less competition for d rops. Any idea how this plays out in terms of getting good gear?
---
Any input is welcome, I don't know a ton about classic but I just know it's between hunter and a 30/0/21 shaman. Which of these is better for someone that isn't ultra hardcore?
---
Why not stop with the layering spam and senseless brigading?  Why not tell us what Internet celebrity put you all up to this this morning?  Why not ban all of you for this spam?
---
Can't talk about this - this is a repost - find another thread. 😁

You group up with people in your own layer. That's the only way the community is going to thrive at all.
---
I did, I played arena
---
The Blasted Lands is so visually annoying... I did the quests there eventually but damn.
---
It was an addon that was popular enough that they baked it into the default ui.
---
Yeah, I think you are right.
---
Are they two minute spawns on Beta? I timed them at 3 minutes elsewhere
---
Thing is, we both know it's not. He tries to be a leader and he's very bad at it. He says the absolute wrong things and it's annoying coming from a leadership position for over 7 years now.
---
Yeah, but they are really more like a consumable than an actual weapon. I feel like it would be a bit misleading to put it in a BiS list.
---
Like it or not, that game is going to rain cash on them.  They did it for a reason.
---
Lot of good that does vs earth shock.
---
Competition effects it in that other people will also be trying to get those black lotuses to use them right away rather than hoard them. People won't have free reign to simply collect all the black lotuses and hold them hostage. Not to mention that it's likely the value of the lotuses will go down as the server ages as has happened with resources during every period of WoW's life, meaning that those hoarded black lotuses will actually be worth *less* than if they'd just sold them at the start of Classic, in addition to the fact that flooding the market with hoarded black lotuses later is counter-productive since demand will have gone down and they'll still be competing with people who are continuing to gather them.
---
Layering is not about population density, it's about total number of players on server. After 3 days you may have, for example, \~7500 population server (assuming 3 full layers of 2500 ppl for some realm) because tourists didn't left the game yet.
---
If density would be only thing they care about, they would just add multiple servers instead. The problem that they trying to avoid is they anticipate lots of players to leave the game once they realize that Classic is not their cup of tea. This would make lots of those server half-dead.
---
The harpy quest chain, ugh.
---
"hopefully". There is no definitive answer.
---
I read this as " it sucks to be rich because you have to pay more taxes" 😅
---
Free layer changes by grouping up to level 20, then require layer changes in major cities only (or maybe inns) 
---
This isn't that hard of a conundrum
---
Don't worry I interpreted that as 60 year old with the boomer context. Not everyone failed language arts class.
---
I'm just imaging a mod heaving a heavy sigh before clicking on the 'new' tab then quickly jamming a pencil into his eyes in frustration.

Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. While I liked Stormwind, the Mages Quarter &amp; Park always struck me as the most aesthetically pleasing part of the city. Too many canals for me though.
---
Ironforge on the other hand, epitomized my idea of a Dwarven city under a mountain, all the way down to the hollow cavernous background noise that strikes you when you enter. It is a warm and welcoming escape from the cold harsh elements in which it is located. It’s shear scale would make you think it had been constructed by giants rather than a people of such a compact bearing. But then again that is Dwarven by nature, always planning on a grand scale.
---
Speaking of planning, The city planners did a fantastic job here, unlike Stormwind, It’s a short jaunt from the Bank to all your main haunts. Whether that’s the Auction House, a Profession Trainer or, of course, the Forge!
---
It's called corporate culture.  And it has clearly been bleeding into Blizzard since the merger.
---
They have months.
---
Yes. It was more of a rhetorical question. My follow up was changes vs. no changes. Clearly you can abuse Layering.
---
OP I was responding to was responding to a comment RE reducing layers down to a server with no layers (what we all want in Classic and what Vanilla was). It was more pointed at that line of thinking RE dynamic spawns.
---
&gt;​As it stands this is literally sharding
---
Been saying that for literally months now only to get told to shut up.
---
They could always just merge servers.
---
Then Stormwind wins
---
The best part of Classic releasing is that I'll be able to do everything I want to do without worrying about the time constraint. None of that "Oh shit, new xpac. Guess I gotta move on" garbo.
---
You'll have to travel back to Bloodhoof to get them, not Thunder Bluff.
---
Ugh... again?
---
A large number of people in this thread don't even speak English as a first language so you can understand their difficulty in understanding what I'm saying.
---
You mistake me, sir. I don't meant to state I want the art direction to change, but to be expressed a bit further in ways that are possible now with graphics having come so far.
---
FF7 is being remade in a way that is artistically in line with how the game was on PS1....... just ten thousand times nicer. It looks..... EXACTLY how I've dreamt it would (when wondering about a remake).
---
Look at Breath of the Wild. It still looks similar to Ocarina of Time in terms of its balance between realism and cartoony-ness, but it's art style has developed and become more distinct and its beeeeautiful.
---
Look at Divinity: Original Sin 2 vs Baldurs Gate (not BG: Dark Alliance, the PC ones). There's a game that retains the exact same feel but simply looks a lot better/more high res.
---
Remember they remade the crash bandicoot and spyro games? Exact same art style (same art in almost every level/enemy) but its just...... beautiful compared to the originals.
---
WoW can keep its art style but still jump from 1999 to 2019, the graphics themselves are what i find lacking. I'm saying WoW needs that sort of facelift (AND THE EXACT SAME GAMEPLAY).
---
It's was already enabled at some point so I would assume it's coming too later..
---

---
notice the "classicalpha" realm..
---
Why? Just because it's classic? Because it's the laziest least sensible model of her from any point of view. Not even a hint of her being dead
---
Less as a human. The one time I did I was human and it was rough.
---
It seems you value avoiding server merges more than the day to day experience.
---
I believe that, with clusters, you'd have the time to get to know all the people on your segment in Dragontooth 2 since you'd recognize them from yesterday. And yes, it would suck when the servers eventually merge but at least there would be no warping around and weird sharding bugs and glitches (which still exist in retail 10 years after sharding was implemented so I don't expect they'll get layering right).
---
&gt;I don't want to wake up one day and suddenly my server is 60% people I've never seen before.
---
Since a mega server hosts tens of thousands of players, layering means that you'll log in to mostly strangers every day unless you are especially aggressive with the friends list and/or satisfied playing exclusively with guildies.
---
I can't imagine Hydra playing on the PvE server. He's a Blizzcon level arena player isn't he?
---
She’s not getting corpse camped in this clip.   
---
She’s at full mana and with buffs.  That simply doesn’t happen if you’re getting corpse camped by multiple rogues who can cast sprint and distract. 
---
She might have been corpse camped previously, (I honestly don’t know) but this clip only shows her quitting, not getting camped.
---
That's right.. thanks for the clarification.
---
In the classic scenario you are completing something that, in the end, will make your character better. It’s rewarding.
---
In the allied races scenario, you are grinding to unlock another character to level and grind the same stuff all over again.  You aren’t better at the game, your character gains nothing at the end, you just have another reason to keep your sub longer.
---
Vanilla rewards the character, BFA rewards your account and makes you repeat the process.

This happened to me in Highschool. Back in the day on Bloodscalp there were these 2 dudes I became close with, so much so that we shared personal info and the likes. However both of them spoke of things that were happening in my town ... in my highschool. After a bit of talking it turned out both of them went to school with me! 
---
This part may draw some criticism but I’ll say it cuz its truth. One of the guys turned out to be someone I was friendly with on the football team and we became super close. However st the time the other friend is what we might have called less than ‘popular’ while I had some degree of notoriety at the time. However this became one of the most fulfilling relationships I have had to date. It was the first time I learned to branch out past my friends and realize that I identified with the video game people more than the athletes. This was the first time I learned to step outside my sheltered superficial world and learn that I’m a video gamer at heart ... not some show off cool kid. Luke if your out there your the fucking man! Since day 1 you were a friend to me and helped me pursue my true self. And Carl if your out there my meme supply is running low ....
---
I’m in the same boat.
---
??? I've seen posts where people complain about layering but nobody explaining how it's different than sharding. I just wanted to know.
---
I stated my argument. What is the point of your post?
---
&gt; It's clunky af, but I reckon it's better than nothing.
---
It is clunky. I think everyone is just trying to cover up layering with bandages when the real solution is extremely obvious: Get rid of layering completely.
---
Silithus.
---
Those elites!
---
We, as a society, put a responsibility on ourselves to prevent self-harming behavior. So yes Blizz has not only the right but a responsibility to make sure their product does not harm let alone cause a death. 
---
I am minding my own business, I have explained in other replies how we don't live in isolation and everything you and I do, especially dying, affects everyone around us.
---
Because you earn like 3x the amount Europeans do.
---
So ask in one of those threads
---
I think you just don't want to see it because its been explained in every thread about layering.
---
You think that's real grind, heh.
---
The way that I understand it is that there are pools of players that make up a "layer". Generally this would make sense to spread them across continents so let's carry on with that assumption. You join Layer 1, that layer has a finite amount of people who can join. Let's say that number is 3,000. As a layer fills up players move into other layers. Let's call these layers 2, 3, 4. It won't matter if you are on kalimdor or eastern kingdoms. If you join a new layer, you will be experiencing the world on that layer, and not the one you left.
---
It's my belief that layering needs to be removed because it creates odd/imabalanced use cases across servers... but I'm not sure how much the community will care about outliers or marginilized guilds/players/economies in that aspect.
---
Streamers have a far more reaching impact on a server than a stream sniper does.
---
The API to make an addon like this existed in Vanilla. Other Blacklist addons also existed.
---
Streaming didn't exist in Vanilla.
---
You grow up.
---
If only there were a search function on Reddit.
---
Or, better yet, what if there was a way we could search... THE INTERNET :O
---
&gt; Merging server is also worse as the community is still not there
---
Oh, so just like layers?
---
The man who thought he had gold.
---
There’s ample threads in the 7000+ spam threads where A) they explain it and B) if they didn’t you could ask about it.  This is clearly just more spam added to the pile that started this morning but now it’s disguised as a question.  It’s sickeningly annoying.  If you’re not intending to add to the spam pile then I’m sorry but you still could have asked this in any of those spammed threads.
---
Or they get banned for a couple of weeks
---
you get to play with them if you are in party. But if you are not it's down to luck
---
It varies with time and with scarcity. Classic will likely end up between and the other pserver which has much lower prices and better stock of resources. Although if people will have timed group at spawn points who knows how the black lotus market will start to look like.
---
You don't know that.
---
Just having one big layer inside this area should be fine
---
Server clustering would solve this better.
---
It’s not a hard concept dude. Their servers can handle 10k+ players. Layering will limit that down to 2-3k per layer. If you added 8000 more players on your server you don’t think that would have an impact on your questing?
---
BoE epics can drop from pretty much anywhere.
---
you might know - why does the prot orc warrior use an axe better than the sword for all other races? is it race locked or something ... the axe's stats look to be overall better than the blue sword ... 9 str+9agi is that big a deal without axe specialisation?
---
Are you talking about when Perplexity used vanish into sap, blind, and a grenade charge and sprint to get away from them? How is that a "lolz" moment? Perp is good.
---
I played on a random, small, TBC private server a few years ago. Like, it only had 200-300 concurrent players. We were talking in guild chat and I found out that one of the players lived in my city, and also worked in the same industry (software). What are the fucking chances of that? 
---
A few months later, I was looking for a job and she got me an interview at her company. We both still work here lol.
---
Here's an idea.. open enough realms. When realms de-pop, merge them. Offer transfers off high-pop realms. 
---
This was solved over a decade ago.
---
I did 80% of the rep grind on a resto druid. Finished it after they increased rep gain, without realizing they. Was just bored in BC and wanted to complete.
---
If I do this again, it's definitely an alt farming thing, with a good DPS class spec.
---
 c c a f
---
I don't think you understand how people react to that level of customization. In FFXIV, you can modify height, and while a lot do make it max height, tons of people go min height too. A few go somewhere inbetween.
---
Sure, but there's a difference between how characters look in terms of their design vs how they look in terms of graphical fidelity/art style. You can't mix graphics/art styles without it looking bad.

---
We really should start calling it: "world first".
---
I don't think they've said it will be there all the way to level 60...?
---
It's sharding with a new name and a couple of tweaks. The amazing thing is how many people actually fell for it. Blizzard knows people don't want this, so instead of removing it as they should, they just put a mask on it and hope no one noticed.
---
&gt; trying to get those black lotuses to use them right away rather than hoard them.
---
Whether they are used or hoarded makes no difference.  The amount picked is fixed.
---
&gt;People won't have free reign to simply collect all the black lotuses and hold them hostage.
---
It's not about holding them hostage.  People farm mats and sit on them, to make products and then sell them when people can afford to pay the price the products will demand.
---
&gt;Not to mention that it's likely the value of the lotuses will go down as the server ages as has happened with resources during every period of WoW's life
---
Yes, which I explicitly said over time it will balance out.
---
&gt;meaning that those hoarded black lotuses will actually be worth less than if they'd just sold them at the start of Classic
---
Clearly when I said hoarded, I gave you the wrong impression.  I'm not talking about some syndicate trying to corner a market or something.  I'm just saying they're going to overfarm them while layering exists, and then when layering is removed, the amount of available black lotus on the server will be much larger than the amount that would have been if layering never existed.
---
As some users have allready said, you can solo some bosses in BRD, which bosses you can manage depends on your class, I played warrior through classic and could solo about half of BRD with MC gear (1/3'rd of my gear were blues still as DPS Arms Warriorthough) without blowing cooldowns unless i fucked up somewhere.
---
(I couldnt solo all versions of the arena though, only some, so farming it for Savage Gladiator Chain requires a healer to join in)
---
Thanks buddy! :)
---
There’s a 2 handed mace that gives spellpower in the AQ raids ifnim remembering correctly, but I know that’s not what you’re looking for.
---
Yeah for sure he is amazing, but right now I think he’s speed leveling PvE alliance side. Will main horde I think
---
Them testing it in the beta yesterday has everyone worried since multiple streamers showcased its faults. There was the clip of the guy abusing it in STV to get another chest that makes the economic implications worrying. Also a smaller thing like Asmongold being forced to make a raid group with another 5 man heading to ST (instead of just being able to see them normally)since they were getting ganked on the way in while fighting the high level mobs. Personally I don't think it will be that bad if they make some tweaks, just will be kinda annoying.
---
How about after level 0?
---
No sunder is not the best threat generator you can spam, thats heroic strike. I tried to tell you this 100 times already. I have tanked all vanilla content both in retail and private servers.
---
Even im not tanking you can see me clear AQ40 here  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL\_tSmoovU8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL_tSmoovU8&amp;t=163s)
---
Notice how initial sundering is not the tanks job.
---
You can experience this right now on a new pserver and see if it's something you want to repeat again. Hint, it wasn't fun for me.
---
The newer one is obviously much better.  
---
I wouldn't care if they totally revamped the graffics in classic.  In fact, i may be in the minority, but i think i'd prefer it.  Not that it really matters much to me.  
---
It's the game-play from classic that i want.  Graffics are whatever.  I think vanilla still looks great due to the art style.
---
Agreed, at least for phase 2 they shouldn't have layering.  With honor having layering kinda messes with the idea of wpvp imo
---
Can someone explain to me, why is the Shield of Condemnation tanking BiS?  
---
The face of death gives you more armor, more block more stamina and shield of condemnation gives you mana regen healing and int? 
---
This doesn't add up.
---
&gt;Issues In layering pop up
---
&gt;People make posts about said issues
---
"Why are all these troll posts coming up guyz?"

The absolute state of Classic.

I misinterpreted your comment thinking you were implying its complete removal (which would be understandable considering it has existed as a hidden function of Divine Shield since glyphs were removed).

I'll just see myself out...

Slam should not be used dual wielding or 1H+Shield. 
---
If you decide to dual wield, and don't want to switch weapons too much, using Heroic Strike and Whirlwind to keep your rage low and using Overpower procs as they happen seems pretty good.
---
I can't imagine the economy will be split over layers, that would bring multiple issues such as not being able to access your auctions or see their competition because they're in another layer.
---
You are so brainwashed by your anti-SJW propaganda that it's actually sad to see. Yes, every single change and new thing that you don't like is because of those mythical, horrifying ''SJWs''!
---
Slam is a waste of rage
---
Yea this really pains me as I wanted Classic to get away from the sharding experience of retail WoW. There are so many problems that having a system like this causes. Your subconscious can tell what players are in the server and where and layering totally kills this worldly feel.
---
Wow the high elves were that bad? Yeh id be more ok with them using a human model over those high elf ones
---
I believe they said that the system will try to put friends list and guildies on the same layers together. That should satisfy some people but, speaking for myself, much of the fun from Vanilla was slowly getting to know strangers based on shared past experiences.
---
A fellow Mage that I grouped up with in STV taught me some great stuff and we leveled together for two days, lost touch, then saw each other again a month later whereupon I invited him to my guild and we became buddies. I used some of the stuff he taught me in STV when I was questing in Un'Goro and it impressed the people from that guild enough to throw me a guild invite on the spot (kited a Devilsaur). The great circle of circumstances that come from one cohesive world.

You wish they weren't. But Blizzard will contemplate anything that has the potential to make money.
---
Fun Fact: That large empty area was originally where Deathwing emerged in Cataclysm, you can even see it in the Cata cinematic, but it was  moved to the Maelstrom / Deepholm later in development. This explains the mystery of the gigantic, dragon-sized hole there, with the surrounding terrain burnt black like that area of Badlands where he cut a couple mountaintops in half. Also this is why he landed on the Stormwind gates and destroyed the backside of SW (which made no sense); it was his first stop above ground.
---
Why the change? I don't know (or maybe I don't remember now, 10 years later.) Maybe because of the proximity of Stormwind? Because they realized, logically speaking, such a thing would wipe out the city, destroy the Deeprun Tram.
---
If you can find early previews of zone changes, there were some that labeled that area "Deathwing's Chasm" or such.
---
To this day I don't know why he ripped a continent sized ditch between Uldum and Loch Modan, etc. I mean, from a game development stance, it didn't make sense. Most of Deathwing's "damage" was the devs deleting massive swathes of unused, empty map space from vanilla.
---
How do you let me guild with people who plan to roll the same server and we do not want to wait till phase 2 with clusters.
---
Layering lets this happen
---
&gt;It does take between 100-120 hours for a brand new player to level from 1 to 120
---
Bull fucking shit. 
---
It takes no longer than 10-13 hours AT MOST without heirloom gear, and someone rushing can get it done in 5-7. 
---
Quit spouting nonsense.
---
120 hours is roughly 5 days...
---
The layering issues have been there all along and this is a sudden and coordinated influx of decidedly low thought posts.  They’re intentional brigading and spam.  Any meaningful discussion that can and should be had would be better off confined to a mega-thread.
---
Ok, So wait a day or two to play? That was my original plan. My new plan is to not play but I sure do enjoy coming here from time to time and seeing people faces once the curtians are lifted and its shown to be a tiny man playing with gears and nobs.

---
Right, or join a group, or go to darkshore...imo it's the quirky, creative stuff that makes it fun and memorable, not just the mindless leveling grind. I'd remember a 5 man group of level 1s  trying to grind through ellwyn on day one far longer than than the routine kobold extermination at norshirshire abbey, even if that IS the preferred leveling method
---
I agree with Stonetalon, but not for aesthetic reasons (I actually quite enjoy how it looks). It's the fact that it takes *so long* to run around. Back and forth down that long winding path, over and over and over.   
---
The other thing is that the quests are super sparse and their level requirements jump all over the place. Start with the grimtotem quests at level 16, then come back for goblins and spiders at around 20. Then you have a couple more at 23ish, and finally you have the harpy quests which are level 27! It's madness I tell you!
---
Frost for leveling, PvP, and MC
---
Then go fire in P2 for raiding, frost for PvP.
---
&gt; It seems you value avoiding server merges more than the day to day experience. 
---
Yeah, because based on what we've seen of Classic so far (which is all anyone on any side of the argument can do), the day-to-day experience is 99% great. Then one or two layering clips pop up and Reddit has a meltdown. I'd rather take a few temporary annoyances than having my entire server suddenly become 1/5th of a megaserver overnight.
---
You're still describing these clusters as if they're anything but other servers. There is zero point in a "cluster" if it has no interaction with other clusters. With layering I can group with *anyone* on the server from the start.
---
&gt; Since a mega server hosts tens of thousands of players, layering means that you'll log in to mostly strangers every day unless you are especially aggressive with the friends list and/or satisfied playing exclusively with guildies. 
---
Yeah, but guess what, I might make a friend out of those strangers. People I would have literally no chance of meeting in your solution. That's so many more potential friends.
---
Isnt that the remade quest tho? Or am i mistaken? I could've sworn it was killing 4 giants 800 times, or yetis 1600 times.
---
The Orc racial gives +Axe bonus which is a significant boost to their ability to hit, hold threat, generate rage, and mitigate damage, making axes the superior choice. 
---
Meanwhile, Mirah's Song is extremely fast with great stats. So anyone not explicitly playing an orc should be using the sword.
---
As someone who intends to play horde, how dare you forget dartol's rod.
---
Part of the problem with WoW is that people are going to complain about somthing no matter what. Thats how we ended up with BFA. layering is not a big deal
---
... So it doesn't actually prevent layer hopping? You actually thought about this at all?
---
I really hope this is just a random word (of the limited possibilities for language translation across factions).  
---
It's such a stupidly specific insult, it's perfect for these o o g s
---
WoW subs have always been increasing with no layering in place so I don't think the crowded experience hurts players (probably helps the community aspect in fact). Even in really overpopulated areas during the TBC and WOTLK launches with huge sub numbers this fixed itself within a few days.
---
I payed for a leveling of my priest back in Vanilla, I was on deployment, and was pretty happy to come back to a leveled priest. I already had my mage to 60, and didnt want to /played another 15 days just to get an alt up. 
---
that said, if that becomes a thing in Vanilla, I will 100 percent not play it.  My ethics now and then are pretty different.
---
As a horde, would getting a second fear ward be that big a deal, I don't remember how useful it was back then ... I keep looking at tauren tank for some reason ...
---
From the beginning, layering has just been a mask on top of sharding. It's literally the exact same tech, they just tweaked a couple things, renamed it, and half this subreddit fell for it.
---
I will never understand why blizz transformed w3 sylvanas into a villain in wow. You should relate to her if you play forsaken, but they changed her so much that she could be another character and it would be more believable.
---
It’s almost like they are testing on the beta server
---
&gt; Activision owns it
---
Activision does not own World of Warcraft, Blizzard does.
---
I know you interpreted what I wrote correctly, it was very univocal. Still you decided to add to your previous cringe with this new one about "hitting lvl 60"...
---
When you look at classic IF is the more used.  Though will be nice to see Dar with people in it again.
---
Theres a lot of non sexualized females in WoW. Like literally every other female model on the hode side. Not that i agree that having her belly shown makes her into a sexual object only
---
It's 2019.. Women can show their belly if they want and still be badass for their personality and actions.
---
Just say fuck it! When you login the first time you get set to a specific layer you then play only with the 2500-3000 players on that layer. No hopping and as layers die just merge them into other not dead layers.
---
Hoping for some future content after Naxx is finished in some of these zones. I don’t want TBC, I want to stay level 60 and explore other foreign parts of Azeroth
---
I actually don't mind Badlands. It always felt to me like a chill out of the way zone that never has too many people in it.
---
I mean, there's a lot of blizzlike features people don't want to see in Classic. Dynamic Respawns were not added until many years later. Nice that the pservers can launch like that, but I just have no idea how they could possibly do that under 1k dollars. They might wanna apply to NASA in that case...
---
"ItS jUSt ThE bEtA!"
---
"they don't care about fans, they're just doing it for money!"
---
...and vanilla is a niche game with a small audience that is not going to make anywhere near as much profit as other games.
---
It only works in raids and it's great. Guilds can pick up all the loot and doll it out at the end of a raid.
---
I feel like you stop hating life once you get WW axe, so that could be as early as 30 if you got some friends.
---
&gt;5K would be an amazing fun time with no layering.
---
The funny thing too, is they could probably adapt their layering tech to do exactly that. Each layer is really just a virtual server. If they made the layers 100% independent from each other just like real servers, then merging would be easy. From the user's perspective, each layer would just look like another independent server.
---
Why don't they just have a long ass wait to get on super highly populated realms so people don't all go on the same one, then merge the smaller servers later if population drops below whatever number is too low.
---
&gt;It's my belief that layering needs to be removed because it creates odd/imabalanced use cases across servers..
---
I was pretty sure they said after the launch population rush and the realms concurrent players stabilize they would turn layering off. Is that not what their doing?
---
Lol why downvote ?
---
Admittedly the most entertaining part of working in tech is the people that just spout buzzwords and try to pass it off as intelligible discussion.
---
[No reports on WoWWiki of it dropping](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Atal%27ai_Gloves?oldid=545559). [Neither on Alakazam where all variants are listed](http://web.archive.org/web/20080506070635/http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?witem=10787). There was also more proof on a private server bugtracker but it got deleted. They exist on private servers due to a bug. Gloves can't usually roll the frozen wrath variant.
---
But wouldn't that just be sharding?  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought the main difference between sharding and layering...was the one is scoped to a single zone, while the other is scoped to all the zones?
---
Either way, it would need to be more than just the 1-5 zones.  It's not like everyone leveling in the human starting area isn't gonna be going to do the Elwynn Forest quests and hour or so after launch with everyone else.
---
I thought so, in my other comment I mentioned if they're doing that under 1k dollars they should apply to NASA

probably wont be a problem in most guilds as loot is given out to specific people for a reason most of the time
---
TRUE =D
---
woosh
---
If you dont know the difference between layers and merging servers... plz google it
---
As a warlock I've always had trouble with hunters. I usually level as demo instead of affliction so rogues are an easy meal. Hunters though.. I just can't get on them to fight them. This time I will try and level up engineering while leveling so maybe the rocket boots will help a bit.
---
Shadowpriests are also quite scary, especially if they have their shadow res buff up.
---
&gt; ...and vanilla is a niche game with a small audience that is not going to make anywhere near as much profit as other games.
---
It's funny that people still spew this even though the Classic sub numbers are going to dwarf retail. They only gave the go ahead to develop classic because they finally saw that it would be FINANCIALLY prudent to do so.
---
I'm sorry, I thought "right now" said "right" as in, right, here's how it works. I thought you were backing up OP. My mistake.
---
That's completely irrelevant.
---
Lets say the threshold for a new layer to activate is 1000 players.
---
Server A has 3000 players and layering is active. There will be 3 separate versions of every node, mob, etc. effectively tripling the amount of available resources to that server.
---
Server B also has 3000 players but layering isn't active, there will only be 1 unique version of every node, mob, etc.
---
Server A is going to have significantly higher supply than Server B, but both servers will have the same level of demand.
---
The fact that layering is only going to active for, at most, the first phase actually makes this even worse, as far as the economy is concerned. Guilds that get in early and know how to take advantage of layering and get in early are going to have a massive gold advantage over guilds starting post-layering.
---
It's a beta, you're seeing bugs and reporting them. The system works.
---
For rotation cast frost bolt
---
You're right. All the available quests are for drops from Winterspring mobs. There's no cloth turn in for wintersabers in vanilla.
---
enhancement should pretty much be hunter minus ranged weapon plus best 2h...
---
Oh I'm sure they've thought of other solutions, but they take more time to implement than just turning on sharding, or sorry "layering", and calling it a day. It's much cheaper for them to build, and it's much cheaper for them to manage their cloud servers.
---
They obviously know it's a shit solution, or they wouldn't have tried to deceive their fans by renaming sharding. But greed trumps quality.
---
I posted in this thread a few weeks back. Still no idea what to play.  I'm mostly leaning towards a human paladin at the moment, and being a healer in melee range of the boss for the judgement of light/wisdom to help the rest of the raid, and weaving in some auto attacks to keep the judgement on the boss, but I'm also considering a caster of some kind or another, either a gnome warlock or 3 minute mage. Yes, I am aware that 3 minute mages are total cancer because they can instantly fling their huge fiery balls at you and turn you into chunky salsa. That's why I want to make one at some point. I'm likely going to do all three at some point, so my question is more which I should do first, rather than which I should do at all.
---
Min/max use rank 1 frost bolt for the slow effect, and not waste mana.
---
classic tbc wotlk cata mop wod legion bfa  
---
she is also V8 (version 8) in retail
---
Your feral weapon enchants are wrong, weapon damage does nothing for kitty or bear so you want attack power or strength or agility.  Weapons are stat sticks only.  Even weapon on hit enchants are useless for feral.
---
???????? lol what is this logic?  
---
EVERY company is concerned about WHY you are no longer a customer and how to get you back; especially since you're still playing their game.  They are bringing back Classic because you (and a ton of other people) have been playing on Private Servers for years and haven't been paying Blizz for it, so wtf are you talking about?  Classic is coming back because of people exactly like you.
---
This is true. It's organized by server, pretty much a big guest book with contact information. I didn't start until wrath but have seen soooooo many nostalgic names that I never thought I'd read again and probably wouldn't have remembered if I didn't.
---
The economy spans across all layers. (Not sure about the AH, but certainly trading goods/services between players spans across all layers)
---
So you can get black lotus from layer 1 and sell it to someone from layer 2.
---
Not exactly as straightforward as you're theory, I don't believe.
---
&gt; Classic sub numbers are going to dwarf retail
---
I'm a massive vanilla fan. I would be insanely surprised if Classic had more than 500k subs after 3-4 months, considering that even the biggest private servers had ~100k players max.
---
Just because you like the game does not mean the rest of mainstream gamers will.
---
&gt;because they finally saw that it would be FINANCIALLY prudent to do so.
---
And an MMO does not need to have 2 million active subs to make a profit.
---
Well personally i'm not sure which i'd prefer. But dynamic respawns are even more abusable, people will just farm insta-respawn mobs in groups for the best source of XP and loot, which is what people do in Retail for greens to disenchant and cloth.
---
Not exactly, enhance prefers str to agi.
---
Would you have preferred people who oppose it speak out about it every day constantly? That would be pretty annoying. I think you're seeing a lot of frustrations that people have boiling over as the beta bugs bring into light what sharding the 1-60 Classic experience will be like.
---
That is actually a great idea. lol
---
Software Engineers at Blizzard get paid an average of 94k.  I'm not 100% sure what the starting pay is, but considering it's California, probably closer to that.
---
https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/Blizzard-Entertainment-Software-Engineer-Salaries-E24858_D_KO23,40.htm
---
Also, the national average of this job in Cali is 103k, so 94 isn't a bad cut to work somewhere prestigious like Blizzard.
---
If your brother actually got a job for 150k straight out of college, that is incredible and certainly not the norm.
---
While it's possible layering will still be broken at launch, 2 months is a lot of time in game development to try and fix something, and these issues are likely to be a very high priority for Blizzard.
---
It’ll be slower. I do this as a healer alt. The tank I mix questing with dungeons. Basically I’m out running quests while a group forms, then hop in when people are ready.
---
feels like you're bending me over ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Removing layering will result in massive queues at launch and/or dead realms at the start of 2020
---
Because merging makes most people from those low-pop servers lose their entire identities. This is the best possible way to implement this.
---
No, I'm rolling Horde.
---
I gave 500g to Swift and he said my name on stream!
---
Hey guy, cringe is all in your head and neck.
---
It will suck in dungeons when people click need on an item they don't need but what can you do.
---
i get that. my point is that each layer doesnt have the normal population of a vanilla server. 
---
if theres 5 layers to the server, then each layer has 1/5 the population of a normal server, but theres 5x as many resources out there because there's 5 layers. lefty is correct, this is exploitable and people will farm the shit out of it.
---
Paladin dispels cost next to no mana yes, no paladin is going oom from dispelling. Cleanse costs about 125 mana at 60 with a 6k mana pool you can cleanse for days
---
For sure.
---
I'm conflicted.  I understand the need for layering from the perspective of a smooth launch where everyone has a good time.  But certainly it doesn't need to span the entire world for the entire lifetime of the game.
---
on the flip side, have you tried leveling on some private servers recently?  There were sooooo many people in elewynn forest, 3 quests took me an hour because there was just not enough quest mobs/materials to go around.
---
Why do i get the feeling that people who ask this question already know the answer?
---
I would eat everything in my layer and then have him invite me to eat everything in his layer too
---
That's not what he's asking
---
Bean
---
... ok really, what streamer sent all of you kids here this morning?  Is there no school?
---
You can't loot trade in a dungeon, afaik.
---
I don’t understand, can you make a 10 minute YouTube video on the rotation? Thanks.
---
Oof using Overwatch as a litmus test for popularity hurts my brain. On paper, Blizzard can probably say it has "millions" of players, but in reality.... It's not doing so wel
---
Since they are using the old mount system where you need "tiger riding" to ride it you also need to be exalted with darnassus if you are not a night elf to use it.
---
Some people might be in for a suprise
---
i do, but i wasn't clear in my reply. my point was that layers dont have full server pops.
---
Even if the Ravasaur were in classic, you only get the frostsaber unlocked for the character that has done the rep grind. Account-wide things didn't really exist in vanilla.
---
I COME FROM THE ORCS
---
WE EAT WITH SPOONS AND FORKS
---
WE LIKE TO EAT OUR PORK
---
play orc. Orcorcorc. Orc smash.
---
Yes, this is correct. However if you can easily gain that same advantage without paying, it is no longer p2w. This is the most agreed upon definition of p2w nowadays, whether you agree or disagree.
---
Damn... never been wooshed before. This feels bad
---
Zones yes, new classes absolutely not. 
---
They wouldn't fit in the Vanilla roster of classes.
---
Did part of the grind during TBC and completed it during WotLK (according to the Armory), but I'll be doing a new attempt in Classic for sure. By how much was the rep gain buffed, roughly?
---
From my other comment in here:
---
&gt;The S6 shield [Shield of Condemnation](https://classicdb.ch/?item=22819) apparently had its values changed in early 2007 to the ones listed in classicdb. wowwiki versions from 2006 [(Link)](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Shield_of_Condemnation?oldid=374257) list it @ 3425 armor, 68 block, which brings it more in line with [The Face of Death](https://classicdb.ch/?item=23043) (which makes sense, since one drops off KT, one off Sapph). See also [twinhead](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?issue=11563).
---
The way it is listed in the item data base, it has 500 extra armor vs 11 Stamina off the Sapph shield (the block% is pretty irrelevant). That makes it kinda close, depending on stat weights used. The 2006 version has same-ish armor, which makes the Sapph shield the clear favourite.
---
Just remove layering and implement dynamic spawns timers like private servers did it.
---
That worked better than this and had 10k+ making lvl 1's at the same time.
---
im with you brother, I think Layering is Blizzard way of punishing the playerbase for not accepting sharding. Iv never wanted sharding for starting zones so much in my life.
---
I am also captain placeholder
---
That's not how layers work. Servers don't have the population of one normal server and dividing it between 5 layers. New layers are going to be dynamically created as the online population of a server goes up, if there's only the population of a normal server online then there won't be layers, just the normal server.
---
Worded very poorly. Why did he repeat himself and mentioned level 60 later on?
---
I feel like people are massively underestimating how many people are going to be on the classic servers at launch. It would suck balls to hit level 20 and then be unable to quest because now there's a thousand people in your area.
---
r/oopsdidntmeanto
---
Unless your guild is trying to push server first I wouldn't worry about race too much.
---
Trolls have a very useful haste, but it can be difficult to weave into your rotation.
---
Undead have the fear break which is convenient, but typically of overkill for warriors since they have access to one fear break at least, depending on consumables and spec.
---
Orcs have the axe specialization which is great... obviously only if you can get your hands on a good axe. Also their stun resist is surprisingly good for pvp.
---
Tauren have the health bonus, but it's a very small amount. More impressive is their aoe war stomp which is exceptionally good. It mitigates a ton of damage, assuming your targets can be stunned.
---
Teldrassil is the GOAT level 1 zone and I'm prepared to fistfight anyone who disagrees, meet me out back behind Arby's at 3.
---
Right for sure.  Anybody who says left is just contrarian, or if they really believe it, are completly blinded by nostalgia goggles.
---
I'd prefer a few things:
---
1. People kept thoughts on layering in 1/2 threads rather than making 1 every minute that just get locked
---
2. People actually offer viable solutions rather than ones that are identical to the problems layering is attempting to fix
---
3. People stop acting as if a beta is the be-all-end-all and Classic is doomed while simultaneously complaining that streamers aren't reporting other things in the beta that are "obviously a bug"
---
But I know I'm asking a lot.
---
This is definitely going to be used since 30% of the pop is rolling mage. More every day too
---
Duplicate name problems.
---
Server name problems(omg I love illidan and dont want to play on bloodrock. )
---
Yeah if you don't want the vanilla experience but the vanilla private server experience, stay on your private server. It's really that simple.
---
That only means that the supply will be higher but the demand will be proportionally higher as well, which means no effective change.
---
So your contribution to the fact layering is currently busted and actually got worse comes down to "they will fix it".
---
If busted layering is present at launch, as soon as people hit high end gathering material holding zones, the economy will take a huge hit since people will exploit the shit out of it. 
---
No post launch correction would be able to fix the harm done to economy.
---
That's strange, I don't feel it unless looking at your comments))
---
Spinning up more layers requires more server instances which requires more hardware. The alternative isn't fewer layers with more people, the alternative is queues.
---
Yeah, once Azuregos is introduced in Phase 2 Cold Snap is BiS until AQ, though I get the idea for using the Stylus in AQ if you’ve already swapped to fire, since Cold Snap is Frost SP.
---
People on this reddit don't get that, paladins in Naxx patch are arguably the most broken class in the entire game. They literally can't go oom and they have the defense of a prot warrior and yet we have people talking about "you can't dispel it costs too much mana" lmao
---
then you were are apart of the problem and probably think modern wow is great.
---
Classic &lt; Pristine    TBC &lt; Ruined things    WOTLK &lt; Ruined things forever.
---
I dont think you understand the term "ceiling". It implies it's harder to master. Now I should have said "extremely high compared to mage" but the sentiment remains. It is much harder to master a rogue than a mage for abilities, timing, and cooldowns for PvE and PvP.
---
Activision Blizzard, sorry mr pc principle.
---
Id be happy to sit in a 10 hour queue if it ment not have destroyed servers personally.
---
I think its a shame blizzard are giving in to tourists like yourself who wont be playing a month into the games life anyway. Classic wow DOA?
---
I don’t see how it’s even questionable. The old model is a generic night elf. It’s absurd that it’s even debated. 
---
Uhhh I’ll take the one that looks like an undead BLOOD elf, with unique armor, please.
---
I also slipped in a bit of sharting, it’s a multidimensional post therefore not low effort you see.
---
Nonsense - the servers are not intended to hold anything remotely close to 20k people.
---
Hi, /u/shewieee
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c07l3k/will_a_list_of_servers_be_available_before_the/). 
---
At this point I feel like just adding dynamic spawns would be less disruptive to the vanilla experience than this layering stuff.
---
Ironforge is the place to be to show off your phat loot and inflate your ego. Just sit on that bridge.
---
Blasted Lands has great grind quests, that reward really strong buff items which many tryhards will farm for raid. 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?quest=2581
---
https://classicdb.ch/?quest=2583
---
For example but there are more like that. They net you around a level of xp and some great gold at around level 50.
---
Did it in Vanilla. Had nothing else to do while you wait for your friends to hit 60.
---
Concur, cannot go wrong with uldaman. I've seen many a boost group crash and burn in there.
---
Because there's 3 major problems with this.
---
1. Large queues are not fun, encourage unwanted/poor behaviour (people playing extremely extensive sessions, or 'exploiting' the afk system and staying logged in constantly), and split up friends/guilds/etc. As well as just not being great for anyone with a proper schedule, as you have little control over when you can play
---
2. By your own implication, it will naturally create an imbalance between servers, through a bit of FOMO and queues being 'attractive' to some degree since it indicates good populations. So you've inherently got a system which you know creates 'good' servers and 'bad' servers
---
3. Regardless of populations/queues, a system with no kind of layering/phasing of any description is going to be a total unmitigated shit-show for some time right at the beginning. The starter zones will be completely unplayable, unfun, and may even cause the servers to crash
---
Layering addresses all of these to some degree, and is just clearly a better situation to have. With the caveat the final implementation is well thought out and doesn't have problematic exploits.
---
is that the level squish survey? I never get any of these emails, I don’t know why.
---
I really do though.
---
You're completely right. There are a ton of people in this thread already saying "Ok I accept layering will be in classic, but this is too far!"
---
Awww... trolled bro... they trolled you hard
---
Just put the server name in front of the player name like they do on merged realms nowadays.
---
I don't think I hung out in any city in Vanilla, of you rang to get stuff done you have to go out on the world.  But IF was the one stop shop for AH, bank, BGs.  With easy access to the harbor, BRM, plague lands.
---
I'm just a normal guy, are you saying I'm trolling by not liking layering and posting about it? And how are 3 posts a brigade? Nothing you are saying makes any sense. 
---
There was a video posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c00e5r/venruki_gets_second_arena_master_chest_by_hopping/) where the layering issue was shown first hand.
---
Maybe people watched that and did not like it?
---
5, or 3, or however many layers the server is currently running, whatever. its not a fixed amount, it was an example. you're glossing over the point i am making to argue about how layering works.
---
my point is that theres still more resources available than there's supposed to be, and theres videos out there of people exploiting that by logging out/in and they are placed in a different layer with more nodes available to farm.
---
The spirit is willing but the body is saying know.
---
Again, all of that assumes that the supply will be higher while demand won't be which isn't the case.
---
 Just have separate servers ?I thought that classic will not have such a thing like phasing and layering.
---
You can swing by and watch me at AyleGaming. I’m pretty small with about 20 viewers but it allows me to interact with most people who have questions. I will be playing shaman/warrior/mage this weekend.
---
They already “promised” to end it by the beginning of phase 2 so assuming they don’t go back on that it it shouldn’t be an issue then.
---
Going Horde this time, or I'd do it again. Such a beautiful mount!
---
SAME THING HAPPENED TO ME
---
this meme only makes sense when you also have personal loot
---
About 4-5 of grinding the same quest for 4 hours a day
---
OP said he's planning a enhancement shaman build and they cant use swords. Also its a debuff.
---
[A brand new factory sealed version is $20](https://www.ebay.com/itm/BRAND-NEW-FACTORY-SEALED-World-of-Warcraft-Battle-Chest-Windows-Mac-2007/133005201264?epid=110679081&amp;hash=item1ef7ba4f70:g:6wUAAOSwmBJcnFeW).
---
Why would you even think mounts are account bound for Classic? lol
---
Its irrelevant. People can still drink till they go to a hospital or use drugs. Let people do what they want. As you yourself said, prohibition didnt work that well. Tell me, What is a lot more likely to happen when someone tries to be awake for 5 days straight to get to max level in classic? Death or falling asleep? I think the latter is a million times more likely.
---
Instead of each zone being one instance, it will dynamically change based on the population. So instead of 100 players fighting over 30 boars it'll split the zone instances up so maybe it's 2x 50 players. (In general)
---
They are, or that is their plan at least. I'm not overly concerned with game state after the rush, but before the rush. Once the "tourists" have left the servers will be in a stable state in terms of economy and mats. Guilds will have farmed the things that they need to progress quickly through the next content, the AH should be full of items to help new players gear etc. However, with layering you can get exception servers with massive populations on them that can be abused by people with exploit knowledge. Imagine, if you will, Asmon takes his full stream to a server and decides that his guild needs to be fully flasked/BIS etc. Becuase of his popularity and reach he can theoretically flood the market with Krol Blades, Black Lotus, enchanting/alch/crafting mats. He can do this simply because he will be cloning his server with the sheer amount of players that will want to come join and play with or help him.
---
That on it's own is not a bad thing. A server being able to support the player base in terms of items is not inherently a bad thing. The problem lies when people with influence abuse that mechanic. Guilds who push for world firsts on lower population servers could find themsevles severely outclassed by guilds who have the social reach and exploit knowledge on much higher population servers.
---
It's because of that, I think they should do away with layering and get us back to server queues. Sure, that will be a negative for folks who end up on "popular" servers, but thats a risk you run and one you can adjust to.
---
Blizzard does read this sub.
---
Layering isn’t going to be for the lifespan of the game. It’s for phase one only.
---
Are there alternative/second best choices? Such a cool project but obviously some BiS might be super hard to obtain so thought I’d ask.
---
I say start with that one purely because i know I ran it at 60. I would group a bunch and pop blade flurry. I ran through it for hours upon hours trying to get PoD to drop from trash.
---
Respectfully I disagree on the PvP sets part. Darkshore leather Horde set is THE BEST, one of the coolest sets they've made in my opinion. I really wish I did rated though... the elite pvp set is one of my favorite leather sets they've ever made, and i'll never own it :(
---
800 days or is the quest repeatable?
---
Bascially it means crating a new virtual Server when the population exceeds the planned capacity of the server to reduce the amount of players that "play" in the same world and ease Questing.
---
I was being sarcastic, I hope you intended to sound ignorant.
---
BFA model... I much prefer BFA animations and modles.
---
Imo it's a no brainer to have the updated art in classic.. that would be a win win in my book. But I totally get that people want the pure classic experience.
---
what it comes down to is that I am just happy to have classic back updated graphics or not!
---
1.) Understandable. Like I said, there's a lot of frustration. This is an insane thing and I think people are glad to see that there is finally some movement against this and so they're participating. 
---
2.) 
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c06uj5/the_solution_to_the_tourist_problem/
---
Come upvote me dawg. 
---
3.) I think the beta is confirming what we already suspected. This is a system made by a company that is still having issues with sharding in retail after a decade. I don't think that layering will work out smoothly and we are seeing that in the beta. It's not that the beta is the end all be all; it's that it gives a visual to speculation.
---
I'd strongly suggest for tanking that Daggers + Mugger's Belt be BiS.  Darrowspike or Alcor's Sunrazor as weapons come to mind.
---
Winterspring
---
You have to grind your ass off but you can get this mount as Alliance.
---
No, I didn't gloss over anything, I pointed out that what you said depends on a fundamentally flawed view of how layering works. They're not going to divide a normal server population among layers, they're using layers to support multiple times the normal population of a server on one server. You won't have 3 layers with 1/3 of a normal server population on each, you'll have 3 layers with a normal server population on each of them.
---
And yes, there are ways to exploit layering on the beta. Finding issues and coming up with solutions is the point of beta.
---
So it's okay for a large portion of the population to inflict self-harm, but but not the 3 idiots that wants to nolife it to 60 in wow?
---
And my argument can be used for outliers as well, there's different degrees of obesity and we could limit the top 1%
---
I like side-thong Silvanis From Cata.
---
Yep, also asks about how you feel if they let you purchase max levels in classic for $
---
A website that suggests dual Freezing Bands for a Mage is absolutely worthless.
---
Because he’s looking at it from a survivability pov instead of tps
---
After this I run around and see more alliance and eventually fight them at the orgrimmar gates until they get layered away again.
---
I feel hurt that you said carrots before peas.
---
&gt;Blizzard had clearly stated many times that layering will only be for early leveling. What does black lotus or devilsaurs have to do with anything?
---
No they didn't, They said it could last till the end of phase 1. Sharding was going to be starting / early zones only. 
---
Layering could last anywhere from a couple weeks to 6 months (dont think they said how long each phase is but 6 months seems about right)
---

So now my name is Illidan-Efften?
---
How do people whisper me?
---
I would rather just be Efften.
---
🤦
---
oh... oh no. I really hope they don’t do that.
---
But they do. Vanilla servers weren't great at holding a large population.
---
It was definitely just to keep healers entertained in other ways. With how little healing goes out compared to BfA (hots for everyone!) it would make playing a healer a bit more exciting than the standard fill those tiny bars. I plan on playing a holy priest during classic and having healing combat text for other players would be rather enjoyable to me.
---
&gt;Ah a boy can dream about playing a lvl 60 night elf DH
---
Sounds more like a nightmare to me.
---
Am I missing something? What is with all the layering topics today? Are people rehashing the same old stuff or did Blizzard announce something regarding layering?
---
&gt;So your contribution to the fact layering is currently busted and actually got worse comes down to "they will fix it".
---
My "contribution" is pointing out that finding issues and fixing them is literally the entire reason for doing a beta.
---
the infrastructure is there in the beta. Modders have unlocked the interface and buttons and they aren't leftovers from retail interface. I bet there will be mount and pet shop in the future.
---
Duo level with a priest or something, or better yet a shaman. A warrior with pocket heals is hilarious
---
This isn’t true. It’s already been shown that some drops actually drop MORE often in classic and vice versa. The consensus I’ve seen is that it’s pretty even in the long run so far.
---
Yes since they aren’t releasing unarmored epic mounts.
---
Sure but no matter how you slice it, it's still incredible for WoW Classic that a level 30 dueling tournament racked up a similar online heartbeat to the semi-finals of a multi million dollar eSports event.
---
Shield slam and slam are two different abilities. And no it is not a waste of rage there are plenty of times tanking bosses where you have excess rage. So don't come in here spouting misinformation.
---
Im not sure on what ur data is based on, but I don't expect player numbers to drop that fast. For example if we compare it with osrs I know its different, but the only event that is slightly the same, the player Numbers never went below rs("retail").
---
It's too much work to turn random paragraphs into usable data when you have potentially tens of thousands of submissions
---
Because the warrior I had been grouped with and was standing beside was gone and I could see alliance now in ratchet.
---
No he lived through both.
---
That's rough. Thank god it didn't happen on a Friday. That would've ruined my weekend.
---
There’s been over 50 posts since 7am alone about layering.  They’re being removed by mods because they’re spam and brigading.  They’re too frequent and too many to be coincidental.  That video doesn’t specifically say to come spam r/classicwow about it but I’m willing to bet there’s a streamer or YouTube video creator somewhere who has and his army has shown up in full force.
---
I was watching a speed run of some jrpg on twitch like 5 years ago or something, there weren't a ton of people in chat so everyone was able to read what other people was saying, i was chatting with one person in particular and it turns out he lived in the same town as me and would ride his bike past my house daily on his way to work
---
What they mean is that each layer has a population equivalent to a server in vanilla. The server as a while can hold more.
---
That's.... not what I said. What are *you* talking about? Whether you do separate servers or separate layers, at some point they are both going to be merged.

That's correct. Only within raid groups.
---
So it sold as well as Warhammer domestically?  Are you trying to say that Warhammer was also mediocre?
---
Don't forget the darnassus exalted if you're not a night elf. Though you should probably acquire sufficient runecloth during the grind to accommodate.
---
Probably ZF with decent gear. Not sure you’d be able to kill princess honestly.
---
I really hope not. They have retail to put all that shit in. But I wouldn't bet against it if classic becomes more popular than retail.

I haven’t seen two but definitely thought it was possible he was dead at the end of 1 when he “returns home”
---
mark my words, the age of MMO's is over, the new generation of gamers already has online play and chat in basically every mobile game on the market. That was one of the main reasons WoW was so huge. If there ever is a WoW 2 it's going to be some kind of weird battle-royale-with-a-hub-world thing and not a sprawling huge landmass to explore.
---
Careful. Any mention of this, even though it's sound, gets removed by /u/spearmints and /u/Undoer simply because they don't like it.
---
Please keep these coming. Quality content!
---
Been waiting on some new Tips content!
---
There are tons of solutions to this already. They could even leverage their sharding tech to do it (which is kind of ironic), but just ensure that each shard is 100% independent from the next. That way, from the user's perspective, each shard acts like its own independent server.
---
&gt; the cost to develop the layering tech was higher than it would have cost to just have extra servers at launch
---
Also about this, the cost to develop the layering tech is basically 0, because it's literally the exact same tech as sharding.
---
No bitch we hanging out in IF.
---
Do you have windows in the rock your living under? Have you not witnessed what's been happening in the games industry for the last 4 years?
---
If it can be an Orc it's the best race for it.
---
Well on live retail you can summon people into instances so thats not as big of a deal, in classic you can't do that though, so the summon spell would drop in value a whole lot if you can't meet people outside of instances. It would be almost entirely useless.
---
It's not about standing up more servers. The issue is after the initial hype and people leave they dont want to leave servers empty ghost towns.
---
Arena focused on everything I don't enjoy in PvP. I always loved being healer, and it removed 50% of the choices I make during bg and open world PvP. It is NEVER a good idea to let someone die, while in bg, for example, you can think "that mage is almost ouf of mana, if it dies now it will take ~15 secs to revive and will be with full mana again, can I defend those 15 secs alone"? Positioning is a lot more harder to evaluate in bg and open world than arena, as those are more open. In arena you have to keep close to a column, while in bg you can do that in the middle of the fight, 20~ meters away, stay really far away and weave in and out of the range, or a mix of those things. The removal of consumables is another thing I didn't like, as I enjoy preparing for PvP.
---
I'm not saying that Arena takes no skill to play, it takes a lot of mechanic skill and coordination, while before that you needed to be able to make split second decision all the time about every tiny detail.
---
I don't want arena because the best PvP rewards are tied to it, and I don't have fun doing it, but if I don't do it I will be a lot weaker than everybody else, so I need to choose between dying easily and being weaker or play a game and be bored for weeks just to be at the same gear level than everyobody else
---
Holy shit the toxicity you receive if you just mention layers. People really cant stand having their precious classic wow baby criticized, huh? Anyway, this is the best idea i've read so far to fix layering problems.
---
Swamp of sorrows was one of the coolest zones for me back in vanilla since there were broken ones there. This time around though I'd agree, now I know there's nothing special happening with them.
---
Woah..  I saw someone who appeared to not understand the situation and tried to explain it.  I was genuinely trying to help a fellow in need.  Why are you being so aggressive about it?  Ignorance being the absence of knowledge I'm assuming you meant I was ignorant to you being sarcastic which is true for sure.  Not sure how you would assume someone would take that as sarcastic because initial reports of sharding were to be only in the starting zones and there is still a lot of confusion about this when they changed it to layering.
---
may be a whoosh moment but ... you dont have personal loot in classic
---
Dos anyone know how difficult will it be to get mounts (exalted) from other factions? .eg a normal saber as a gnome?
---
I definitely saw a lot of race condition bullshit like this in Vanilla.
---
thanks!
---
should be called Ships' End or Ship's End (plural/singular respectively) but otherwise nice job. sorry for being a grammar nazi
---
Completely agree here.  
---
Ironforge truly feels like a dwarven city Tolkien would describe in his books.  
---
As a Horde player, I prefered going to IF than SW.
---
The values on WoWhead make sense to come to your conclusion but when talking about private servers, SoC has ~3900 armor and 90 block value which makes it vastly superior.  We will have to wait and see what actual Classic values will be on that, is my guess.
---
I've done it once, I'll do it again.
---
&gt;Ehm no, you pay a subscription fee to play retail. Getting access to  beta is a bonus. Paying a sub does not mean you get access to beta. 
---
I mean you can say that all you want, but a lot of us aren't paying to play retail. A lot of us like myself haven't had subscriptions for years, and resubbed exactly for beta. Either way there is a \*very\* easy litmus test for whether or not I'm paying for it: if I cancel my sub, and it lapses, I can't play the beta anymore.  That means I'm paying for it. If something is a bonus because I paid for something else it means I paid for the bonus too. 
---
&gt; Do you even know what the purpose of a beta is? 
---
I'm a software engineer, so yes. I also know we're saving Blizzard a huge amount of money in writing integration/functional tests as well as hiring testers. We're doing Blizzard a favor not the other way around, and paying for the privilege. Just because I enjoy that favor doesn't make it any less of a favor. 
---
From a functional standpoint: If no one wants to test AV for 3 days straight, and a bunch fuck off the beta it's gonna hurt their beta testing. Everyone on the beta is already pissed about this super aggressive layering. A bunch of my guild has fucked off to private servers, and likely won't be back.
---
Blizz has a vested interest in keeping this fun for the testers, because otherwise they are going to lose testers, and end up with a less polished game.
---
In my world mature people don't constantly look for minuscule things to make a big deal of. If you paint everyone as bigots over the smallest things, then you just end up being a bigot yourself. Mature people don't go around looking for things to be offended by. 
---
Going off the very definition of the word bigot, you are the bigot here who cannot accept that other people do not follow your world view.
---
Badlands is actually one of the more efficient zones to level in when considering exp/hour.
---
Nlt sure what you mean by rare. He is not a raremob if thats what you're talking about. Just a normal elite.
---
Yeah. Wasn't aware of the squish to be perfectly honest. I was pretty honest in the fact that I'm pretty bored and not arsed about playing retail and am only here for Classic.
---
isnt living expensive lower there though?
---
There's no point to spending thousands of gold to twink out a level 60 in pre-BIS. You don't even need pre-BIS to finish Molten Core.
---
Ditto. I got done during TBC when it wasn't nearly as bad.
---
God that series brought me to tears with it's humor.
---
Maybe when a video gets a lot of hits people see it and comment about it? Since it hit the top of classic only 17 hours ago, people might only just now be seeing it. I might be over thinking this though.
---
If you are DPS, why do you hold aggro? Also, there is no rotation in PvP. If you are attacked by players, you gotta screw rotation and play reactively.
---
Its a bis site, not a cheap bis site.  But I agree, that one is a bit of a stretch.
---
That is the idea of layering.  You have 100 realms for 6pm-11pm.  Then you have 30 realms for 11pm-3pm.  Then you have 50 realms from 3pm-6pm.  Repeat.
---
Forsaken paladin definitely makes a better case than tauren paladin.
---
I think some kind of light-using Tauren class would make more sense than Forsaken paladins, it's just that giving them "paladin" as a choice and occasionally substituting "sunwalker" in text boxes with "paladin" while questing in Mulgore is a completely ass solution to giving horde paladins without blood elves.
---
^(fwiw I'm not the one downvoting you, either.)
---
macro weapon switches+stance dance onto specific skills ... would that work?
---
&gt; That's a very simplified idea of how layers work and doesn't really reflect the reality
---
Yes, the point is to look at the effects of layering on supply and demand, which requires that all other factors remain the same.
---
In it's current form, it is objectively true that more layers = more supply, while demand remains the same.
---
&gt; especially since it ignores that layers are per continent rather than per server.
---
I don't see how that makes any difference.
---
What’s the squish you’re referring to?
---
they mentioned the squish during the classic panels I believe but they never confirmed it was happening. also I feel ya, retail is a slow burn right now. waiting for something better to come along in the game.
---
Back during vanilla you were suggested a realm based on your timezone. Because of this it wasn't uncommon to have players from around your area on the same server as you. I met a few IRL friends that I still know and hang out with through wow.
---
The ghost saber is on my list up there with the lone hunter. Hopefully we will be able to tame him with the sword still in his head!
---
The point of layering is to handle population drop-off. It is not at all intended to fix any problem with launch day questing or whatever. 
---
They have layering only so they won't need to merge a bunch of servers as the "tourists" leave. Or have half-dead realms if they decide not to merge.
---
Orc 100% if you're going PvP. The constant passive racial massively outweighs a 2 minute CD warstomp. The health racial doesn't even compare to the burst from blood fury either. 
---
Orc hands down for me.
---
I love Ironforge, although I am Horde. It has this special feel to it. I find Stormwind confusing and a bit too romantic. Also I have many memories sitting and fishing in The Forlorn Cavern and exchanging keks with my Alliance "friends" in the middle of the night.
---
I'm in another conversation with you already on your solution, I'm the guy telling you it's identical to the problem. That said, I'm gonna have to dip off Reddit soon so maybe don't reply to that one, I have a bus to catch!
---
Fire for BWL?
---
He’s a fucking bitch
---
In that instance they’d comment in the thread that’s in HOT about the topic or one of the other hundred some odd threads that pre-exist.  But no, they’re not.  Why are they doing it differently?  Who knows, but I’m willing to bet it’s not accidental.
---
Geared 60 arms warrior still slices thrpugh NPCs, but much faster thanls to sweeping strikes.
---
I howled at "SQL Database"
---
Well, enjoy phasing into different universes.
---
yeah, Warrior is horrible untill you get Mortal Strike, not even whirlwind is that good and Rend is just a bad DoT.  
---
Check out  [https://www.wowisclassic.com/en/class-guide/warrior/leveling-1-60/#tips](https://www.wowisclassic.com/en/class-guide/warrior/leveling-1-60/#tips)  it gives great advice to good players imo.
---
Oh yikes
---
Having experienced day-1 leveling processes in BC, WotLK, and Cata, I'm still conflicted about layering. On one hand it's really nice having the ability to go quest without having to potentially skip quests just because it's too busy. Imagine having 5,000 people standing around in groups of 5 trying to do the Defias Messenger quest. 
---
On the other hand, I rushed to hit 90 in Cata and was 5th 90 on our server. Once I got past the first few levels I quickly started seeing fewer players to contest me for quest mobs. Once I was 3-5+ levels ahead of players, it was basically solo content, so leveling was super easy.
---
So I'm conflicted on whether I want people to have to experience questing in hard-mode for the first couple of weeks or not.
---
Just throwing it out as a suggestion, but maybe having an option to not include world drop boes in this list, or at least the world drop epics.  While they are BiS, they will be very costly and rare to obtain.
---
My apologies. I didn't realize we were referencing a day from OP. My deductions were based off of phase 1. You are right day 1 of game release wouldn't effect it. I would argue up to day 4 with no substantial effects.
---
Lmao my phone is op
---
I think 1-20 would be better, or else the first while is going to be nuts.
---
Certainly it shouldn’t continue into the mid or late game though.
---
Lol anyone who thinks they are not looking for bullshit ways to monetize classic is naive. This thought and many others have already been discussed internally, I'm sure.
---
I am not up to date on how weapon switching is handled in the current beta tbh, but it should trigger a GCD. So you can macro a stance change and skill, or a stance switch and a weapon switch, but not all three at once.
---
On the other hand, it somewhat prevents spawn camping of stuff, since as soon as you log off you can't ber certain of the respawn timer of things.
---
Incredible.  I guess Blizzard doesn’t know what Classic is all about.
---
Holding aggro for tanking in dungeons?  Most of the time I'm just playing with my healer friend so sometimes I need to keep the mobs off them so they don't die.  But sometimes I'm more free to do more damage, which I'm less confident about.
---
What about a solution to 3,000 people in durotar though? That can't just be ignored
---
No doubt it has to do with the Venruki video near the top of the sub (if you sort by "hot" or "top" or whatever). 
---
What people fail to recognize is that this is a BETA TEST and its exactly the place you want to see this type of behavior.
---
Half the sub has already sworn off playing classic because of layering, and they've already had the argument in their head of why. It's like fighting with my sister: she gets all upset because I did something, but then she plays up the thing I did, has the conversation in her head with me, gets mad at what she imagines I'll say, then when we actually talk about it, she's 10 times more upset than she should be, because she assumes I'm going to say what she imagined.
---
I envision myself as one of the top 5-10% hitting 60, so just to poke the bear a bit - I hope layering works this way so I can exploit it for my own personal gain.
---
TBH, I'd be interested in paying for levels.  I played on original release and had a few characters at 60 and I do enjoy grinding, but I just don't have the same time to grind as I did when I was 18.
---
I'm okay too if it's not an option, I just know that my goal is for endgame raiding and PVP and I would like to play different classes for each of those.  I'd rather not play through the same leveling content for months upon months.  Except for Duskwood, that place is spooky lit
---
This is just my realistic preference, totally get why it would be bad to have character boost for the community and culture of the game.  But if it does become an official option, it would definitely be something I would consider.  Maybe it should only be an option after you already have a single level 60 in your account?
---
One thing I think that can be misinterpreted is that Character Boost does not necessarily mean n00b.  It's intended for people with more $ than time imo.
---
No yetis. It's collecting meats, killing furbolgs, or killing giants.
---
Could be, im trying to say, its actually quite enjoyable as prot as well, nothing hard to do
---
“No u grow up!!”
---
Yo, you need boomkin bis? There are some on the classic druid discord and quite a few boomkin theorycrafters (such as myself) who I think would be happy to provide you with BiS lists.
---
Really sunwakers needed BE palladin work if not more where they have specific abilities that only they use. Like maybe their special Seal puts a sun over their heads. Maybe instead of flashes of light it’s like a fire effect kind of like Phoenix from Dota when it Ults. Maybe take a Holy Paladins AOE heal and make it so Sunwalkers drop a miniature sun that heals people around it.
---
Also name them Sunwalker and not paladins like how Sith Assassin and Jedi Shadow are mechanically the same but story and lore wise are not.
---
I think you’re missing the point. WoW Classic was balanced around ~3k server pops (resources, economy, etc). So anything exponentially higher than that creates a problem not just for the starting zones but the overall long term health of the server. Nobody wants 5-10k servers. The question is, what do you do with servers that reach that level and remain there before phase 2?
---
It would be absoltly amazing with overhauled graphics and it really comes down to, and I don't say this lighty, that people can just be fucking morons about things.
---
I do understand a lot of the #nochange attitudes in regardless to certain things, even if I disagree with some, but the #nochanges attitude towards using more updated graphics that wouldn't impact gameplay is absolutely asanine.
---
It really is as stupid as saying that classic wow should ONLY be playable on box minotors with no widescreen support because that is how 99% of the players played it in 2004.  
---
It should also run a hardware check and if its anything made after vanilla WoW ended and BC started then it should refuse to run, ect.
---
This is how they sound to me when they rant about how the old graphics are mandatory or they won't enjoy the game for whatever the reason.  I'm not against it being an option, but I really, really wish you could enable the new models as an option.  I wonder how hard it would be for people to mod it.  
---
I'm going to keep an eye out for a mod that replaces the models with the new ones I think, but its a real shame that the new graphics, textures, ect couldn't be implemented into classic because, if nothing else, the modern WoW art team does absolutelly kill it.
---
Blizz was talking about a level squish a while back. Possibly going back down to 60 levels or something like that.
---
No, probably not.
---
&gt;  But they really need to cut it out with the layering as soon as possible
---
Layering will be completely gone from the game in the first 3 months, before Phase 2. This was stated by Blizzard as not just a possible goal but an absolute requirement before world bosses are added.
---
Those users already censored my post talking about it.
---
This subreddit will soon be a Blizzdrone echo-chamber. 
---
[here it is for all to see, in plain writing.](https://i.redd.it/05s4jmpmc3431.png)
---
I have a different goal, Ram as Human :)
---
Oh I thought you were referring to quest items. 
---
And bags drop way more often on pservers - no doubt about that. 
---
Gray items actually drop significantly more often in classic - so much so that people are questioning whether or not skinning is worth it.  
---
Green items I am not sure about.
---
Edit: let me also add that I am comparing to Ndale - which is the only pserver I have a lot of experience in.
---
If I remember right it was like 1.5 times rep? Something like 50 to 75 or something.
---
Sorry it’s been years I’m not sure.
---
I think it got what it deserved.
---
I don’t think bigger servers is a solution. The game is balanced around 3k~ pops.
---
More servers doesn't help. The newly stood up servers are the layers that we are seeing. They would need to have more efficient code with less overhead, or more powerful servers. More powerful servers are probably a minor upgrade compared to what they are being run on. Modern tech companies load balance over multiple servers/virtual servers/containers, which is exactly what layering and sharding are. Just using modern hardware probably increases the potential playerbase on a server considerably, however it's probably not as much as they expect to reside on a single server in classic wow, hence they are layering.
---
&gt;I really hate how their server architecture has regressed
---
You have absolutely no idea what you are talking about.
---
Layering is obviously broken somehow. If it was working how the devs described, there should never be layering occuring at all because the population of the beta server isn't high enough. I'm hoping all these layering shenanigans are just something that was broken in the last update.
---
I'm speaking about open world phasing. You need 2 players to summon at a stone, if they are in the opposite phase they cannot summon players 3-5. 
---
Warlock summoning in retail requires 3 players, at which point it doesnt matter if you have a Warlock or not because with 3 people, at least 2 of them HAVE to be in the same phase (wm on/off) so they can use the stone.
---
If opponent is close range fighter
---
1. Frostbolt until they get close to melee range
---
2. Frost Nova, run 25-30 yrds away
---
3. Frostbolt until they get close to melee range
---
4. Frost Nova if it’s off cooldown. Otherwise Cone of Cold + Blink
---
5. Repeat until they’re dead. Use Cold Snap in case of emergency
---
If opponent is long range fighter
---
1. Frost Barrier
---
2. Frostbolt until they’re dead
---
If oppent is BM hunter or warlock
---
1. Run
---
We used to crush the horde on my server lol.  Ah good times.
---
Biggest issues I’m seeing is Bonecreeper Stylus being BiS in BWL for Mages when Cold Snap will be available.
---
Another being that, in Phase 2, Netherwind Helm is listed as BiS, when it is far better to have Arcanist Helm + Gloves + Wrists for the 3 Set, and taking the PvP Shoulders to obtain the 2 set for a net spell power gain.
---
In other words, you have low T.
---
So the real question is why are you full Prot? The DW defiance talent choices are so much better once you get more gear the only thing that you are missing out on in DW/Defiance is the fact that you dont have Tact mastery. [https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/?.class=warrior&amp;talents=qCsyszsAsBqorMrNrOrPqrsgqprUrVqtr3r4r5r6sPs3rWrXqEs8s9s\_s.qAsCsDsEsFqzs-tatbtcqHIcIdIeIfqBsZs0s1s2InIg](https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/?class=warrior&amp;talents=qCsyszsAsBqorMrNrOrPqrsgqprUrVqtr3r4r5r6sPs3rWrXqEs8s9s_s.qAsCsDsEsFqzs-tatbtcqHIcIdIeIfqBsZs0s1s2InIg) This spec here is the best tanking spec later anyways. Plus it allows you to build an entire dps spec. Full prot provides you no bonus to anything. And DW/Defiance provides you will very high TPS
---
Isn't lock pretty gear dependent though?
---
just create servergroups that are supposed to merge once there is demand but share the same name-database from the beginning. no need to rename once the merges arrive. and no difference in name availability if you're in a 3x4k servergroup or in a 12k 4layer server.
---
It's repeatable. At 3.5 hours grinding per day it would take about 166 days. Grind more per day means fewer days, obviously.
---
Shield slam dmg is not 75% of mortal strike w a good two hander. Never mind sweeping strikes which is the real OP part of being arms that you conveniently ignore.
---
You can hamstring kite with a 2h which mitigates the dmg without having to use a shield. 
---
Its not just a feeling. 2 handers give bigger whirlwinds, bigger cleaves, bigger mortal strikes. Whirlwind procs sweeping multiple times. It adds up! Prot leveling is honestly just a bad meme.
---
Dude exploited it yesterday to get an extra chest and everyone is flipping out
---
&gt;Layering is absolutely necessary In the first stage
---
Why? I had planned on sticking around on classic, Honestly making it the only game I ever had to play so not playing the second the servers go live would not have been an issue for me. I think its only necessary for people who wont be playing past the first 2 or so weeks and who cares about them? 
---
Now that layering will ruin the game right out of the gate im I unable (Unwilling?) to even give it a go anymore. I guess with the money I saved I can sub another OSRunescape account at least.
---
I did it before, and I'll probably do it again...eventually. It's not a bad thing to do when you just want to zone out and watch a movie or binge watch a show.
---
Most of the transmogs I used in retail before I quit were from vanilla.  They look fine on the new models.
---
Shit, I guess that is true.  I'm no economist so I have no idea.  But in theory that makes sense.  So why is everyone tripping out about black lotus?
---
guilds generally still have incredibly lopsided tank/heal and dps ratios though.
---
Spirit is HIGHLY underrated for leveling.
---
You don't have to be full prot to tank while leveling or even at max level unless you are the guilds MT or something. 
---
Questing is going to be a lot faster unless you have a dedicated group you are running with the entire time.
---
It takes a long time to travel to instances or wait for people to travel to them etc.  So a lot of your playtime will be spent waiting for people to get to the instance and recruiting new people.
---
Everything that is in the beta will be released just like it is!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
It's repeatable.
---
&gt;In it's current form, it is objectively true that more layers = more supply, while demand remains the same.
---
In what way is that true? Supply will go up when there are multiple layers. Multiple layers only happens where there's more players. More players means higher demand.
---
I wasn’t familiar with the idea of soulbound gear as I had come from Diablo 2 - so I would routinely ask warriors if I could have their gear when they were done using it... lol.
---
Gotcha. Thanks.
---
Spawn camping, among any other "problem" you could think is just a normal part of vanilla WoW.
---
Seriously. Any arguable "benefit" from sharding to the game experience is just another deviation away from the game we're all waiting to get our hands on.
---
Locks. Because if you somehow manage to kill them, you will die to the DoTs after and join him in death.
---
Didn't they say the in game store was still going to be used, but only for server transfers?
---
It's more like 500-600 hours, not 120 hours.
---
Some of these people are imagining players farming 50+ Black Lotus a day. It's crazy. I feel like if an entire group of people abused sharding somehow to farm all of the Black Lotus possible, they would likely have MAYBE 15 a day. That would have players basically camping every single BL spawn 100% of the time to ensure that the 2-hour respawn starts immediately.
---
And IIRC there were only 8 BL spawns in the world at any given time. So logistically and logically they're panicking over nothing.
---
&gt; It's just a beta and not too late. 
---
You're right. I don't have beta access either, man. It feels like it's August 27th next week, but that's why we're here. In beta.  RemindMe! 1 month
---
Blizzard gonna immortalize you as an NPC if you finish.
---
Yea but I think at this point that might just be the best thing to do....
---
I’m trying to stay optimistic. This is what the beta is for anyways I think everyone should settle a bit but still make noise about the problems.
---
No, I won't stop saying that, because you don't know what version of layering they'll implement or what limitations it will have, so in reality you actually don't know what implications it will have.
---
The same people who don't want any changes to vanilla yet are going to be looking for a quest helper add-on on day 1. Lol
---
The people who are realists and would rather have stable servers on launch over having their nostalgia ruined by not fighting several hundred other humans for wolf meat. That’s who.
---
Oh, and I love when the main body of a post ignored to mock hyperbole, it really facilitates discussion.
---
If a random private server could handle +15k people at launch then Blizzard can easily do it without layering, am I not right? 
---
But if they want to do it that badly then they should limit layering to a level range like 1-20 or something.
---
It isn't. Server merges are a messy affair and do far more economy and community damage than laying for a few months will. People think layering for a few months is going to mess with supply vs demand? Server merges have a much bigger impact.
---
Inaccurate in that it predicts longer than it'll actually take, right?
---
Push
---
Google
---
Give it a year. Then it will be, "leveling alts tiresome? want to raid naxx but not spend 120 hours leveling? For $60 you too can experience endgame content".
---
Few people will have consistent 1k+ dps even in Naxx. If you look at the rankings on private servers there are currently 5 people who break 1k dps in Naxxramas and they are all mage/warrior.
---
This is actually not a problem on classic beta because they respawn instantly after someone loots them. I understand where you're coming from because on private servers they take like a minute or so to respawn, and Felix's bolts, box, and bullshit is a major headache!!
---
Never heard of a server cap?
---
Please link me to all these deleted and non-deleted posts because the only post I saw that got deleted was a singular meme post that broke rule 7. Which I can link you to if you would like. The rest seems to be something you are fabricating in your mind because the facts don't support your claims. If anyone sorts by new and just looks over the posts they can see you are incorrect. The fact they are at 0 votes also seems to have escaped your notice. If people are doing a brigade. It sure is a shit brigade.
---
There were like 2 quests in that bug village on the east side and the Thunderfury stuff. Can't think of anything else.

You can also take out some rare spawns in LBRS and BRD without too much trouble. Get a druid friend or two and some more rogues and you can run some pretty efficient stealth runs of LBRS, BRD, Sunken Temple, and eventually Dire Maul.
---
I don't really care tbh. In the case of layering (which is pretty much the only significant change they have done), would you actually rather have the alternative? Either half-dead servers or server mergers as tourists leave.
---
Have multiple copies of the 1-30 zones is what I mean. Layers, shards, whatever you want to call it lol.
---
&gt;The people who are realists and would rather have stable servers on launch over having their nostalgia ruined by not fighting several hundred other humans for wolf meat. That’s who.

Also people who realize that server merges later on have a much worse impact than layering for a few months.

You don't want to do that. Travel time is the biggest factor of this grind so you're gonna want to have an epic mount already

If she can't handle me at my nerdiest, she doesn't deserve me at my World's Best Dad™.
---
Yeah it's a bit upsetting that people are standing next to you in the "world" but are actually in a different dimension. I've had good times on vanilla seeing people i know/have played with randomly in the world while doing stuff ("hey! fancy seeing you here!") wheras now there is a fair chance they will be layered out
---
Yea, seems like every time layering causes something like this, people get up in arms.  Likely it won't have an overall effect on the experience unless it's seriously exploitable. I think the bigger thing it manages to solve is that the layers can still act as a server in a sense of community which is a good thing.
---
I think we'll have to wait how much of a success will the classic be. I think blizzard lost the idea of what players actually want and if classic turns out to be a success we might even experience new xpac for retail to be some kind of revert back to roots...or even a new franchise. These are of course more likely just wishes as I am only a regular internet user but who knows...
---
I am saying we have tried and it didn't work. Plus how can you compare complexity of controlling diet, alcohol and drug consumption with making a simple code to restrict 72 plus hrs gaming sessions.
---
&gt; Just wait til you're in the clump of 90 guys trying to loot the three, 2 minute item spawns in dun morough
---
are you referring to Felix and his bolts, box and other item (i forgot)? That's an instant respawn on the beta classic. So this particular quest shouldnt be a problem. On private servers, it takes a minute or two to respawn though. So i get it.
---
Ah, a fellow man of the wild. Druid leveling is so much fun
---
Nothing? Warlocks and priests are my bane, rest is fine. Got any tips? Obviously talking about feral druid.
---
the new one definately
---
The issue that layering fixes is NOT the spawn times. I keep seeing people think Blizzard implemented layering because they want people able to do quests. That's part of it sure, but the main reason is that they can't handle large/dense amounts of players. WoW scales exponentially, each player has to receive data from the server for each other player. The issue with the starting zones is that it will be basically impossible to support that, especially since it'll be bottlenecked and new players HAVE to start there.
---
After the starting zone the population density drops quickly, it doesn't matter if there's 21k people on your server it's not going to be anywhere near as dense in your new zone compared to 5k+ people in a starting area. Layering or sharding is required, there's no server infrastructure in the world that could support that many people in one area.
---
TATTOO or BIC PEN??
---
How reliable are grenades in lieu of warstomp as a hard cc for orc? Do you find them to be readily available to engineers?
---
As a mage: Locks, BM hunters and rogues.
---
Another zone that is contested in name only. Unless I'm blind and I don't see the Horde quest hub.
---
I thought I read PvE. Yeah, Orc for PvP, but Troll PvE hands down.
---
I've never seen this connotation before lol. I like it.
---
Rubix 3, most nostalgic vanilla video for me :-)
---
Disagree.   It should be in the 1-5, and the zones afterward (Elwin, Dun Morogh, Barrens, etc).  After that, things should thin enough that it’ll be okay.
---
Weird, I remember Horde being best at everything from raiding to PvP to Warcraft movies montages.
---
I completely disagree. If you have ever been arms, going to prot and grinding feels awful. You go at a snail's pace.
---
He's talking about 2 different situations. He's saying he knows how to hold aggro when he tanks dungeons, what he wants to know is what his dps rotation should be when questing/dpsing dungeons.
---
Back in the original launch they lowered the spawn timers of the mobs in the starting zones to compensate for the influx of people. I'd much rather they use a similar solution for the launch of Classic then try to implement something like layering which, especially in its current state, completely changes the game dynamics to something that's not even close to the original game. 
---
It's not just how abusable it is, it's the fact that's it's completely broken and immersion-killing.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c03ol5/layering_from_todays_update_affecting_wpvp/
---
People are getting layered mid-combat, both in PvE and PvP. They are getting layered while on flight paths, which immediately kicks them off and they fall to the ground. 2 players in the same layer decide to group up for a rare mob, but this (for some inexplicable reason) transports them both to a new, different layer where the rare mob isn't spawned. 
---
Imagine you're clearing out a camp of mobs for a quest, being very careful to pull them 1 at a time. Suddenly in the middle of combat the mob you're fighting disappears, and a full camp of mobs spawns around you, merking you instantly. You didn't accept any invite, or join any group. You just randomly get layered for no reason and are fucked by it.
---
To me, this is SO MUCH MORE FRUSTRATING than just dealing with a horde of people. If I'm getting screwed because there's too many people, then at least I know why I'm getting screwed and I can adjust my play to compensate. I can form a group to get tags and do quests. I can fuck off to an under-populated side area and grind mobs for a couple levels. I can run over to a higher level zone and pull mobs into guards to leech XP. There's plenty of things I can do to mitigate the issues of playing with a horde of people.
---
But there's not a single damn thing I can do to prevent myself getting randomly screwed by this bullshit layering system. As it stands, I'm not going to bother to play Classic until layering is removed. It just detracts way too much from the game to be an enjoyable experience.
---
Blizzard has to do something, they just can't let that happen

As stated before, I’ll gladly post a healed pic in time. :)

&gt; adding alternatives to BiS items (huge amont of work to do this one, but this is the most asked feature by far)
---
Does this mean that we'll get alternatives to Bind on Equip-items? Some of the suggested items might be expensive, at least for a fresh level 60. It would be great to have an alternative to farm in dungeons instead.
---
Keep up the great work! :D
---
How can they guess which servers to merge before the release? There's too many unknowns. What server will people congregate, what server will keep most of its players and what servers will lose them right away. What if two servers designated to merge remain too big but two other servers dedi gn ated to merge are too small.
---
Also these events suck but they're really un common.  Most people arent experiencing this. It's not doom and gloom.
---
I mean it is good, but sadly not optimal once you get more gear and Threat becomes a bigger issue. Plus you can still tank with that spec with a shield you just are missing out on having SS, and conc blow which are decent talents for 5 mans but the outscaling of BT way outweighs SS any day. This is the spec you will want to run if you intend on doing a high level of play and tanking.

---
If ooga gang makes a guild, you have my sword. And totems.
---
Did you miss the word "should"? They have said things many times under that word. 
---
I don't see it being fully taken out till the night before phase2.
---
&gt; A full realm you can't ever get into is way more likely to get people to populate other realms.
---
This is a double-edged sword.
---
As I mentioned previously, if a server has big queues then to some proportion of people it will actually be attractive. Because they know a healthy population is critical to their server being fun in the long run.
---
So it creates a snowball effect of "because it's popular, it's popular".
---
&gt; Why do you think that? I feel it would promote the exact opposite.
---
It slightly depends how they want to display the servers, and/or whether they cap the amount of layers an individual server can have (so cap the concurrent population to about 4000 * number-of-layers).
---
Hypothetically if they allowed unlimited layers, and had no queues, and randomised the order the servers appeared in the list every time you view it, then all the servers should end up with equal populations (apart from other minor factors like their names and whether they're PvP, PvE, RP, etc.).
---
I still have nightmares about the bloodsail rep grind I did

I just don't care about mythic scores. Its measuring e-peens and shallow. What else is there for rivalry?
---
All I ever do is pug m+ and Ive never even recognized the same rando.
---
Wow, what the hell. That doesn't sound like the horde I'm familiar with.
---
The tourists will mostly stay on lower levels. I personally would be fine with sharding on zones up to level 20 (during the first phase only, mind you). Other than that, I believe Blizzard should find a way to deal with issues in a way that doesn't hurt the play experience.
---
Perhaps that was the plan all along.
---
There's only about 50 effective workdays untill release, and Blizzard is not known as a company that can make changes fast, so we are quickly approaching deadline for an alternative system.
---
The accident is the fact that the human female stretched when i hit my capture device button and it looks like shes posing, holding her dagger. I was taking a screenshot of how small the gnomes were
---
Regarding the warlock list:
---
&gt;low droprate items in dungeon/raid are ignored (legendaries, ironfoe, ...)
---
You're still listing stuff like the Archivist Cape of Shadow Wrath, Drakestone of Shadow Wrath, Flameweave Cuffs of Shadow Wrath, and the Atal'ai Gloves of Shadow Wrath- all of these have a &lt;2% chance of dropping, potentially even rarer than Ironfoe. There will literally not be a single soul mad enough to farm all 4 of those items. If you're not including Ironfoe you shouldn't include any of those either. 
---
You don't put Kazzak pants in any phase- is that just due to rarity? They're very hard to get but definitely BiS until bloodvine. Mana Igniting Cord is definitely better than Sash of Whispered Secrets- slight loss in shadow damage is more than made up for by the crit. Touch of Chaos is missing from the P4 list.
---
Oh ohh you mean in retail
---
nazi mods DansGame
---
is layering like phasing in retail or is there something different about it? Genuinely asking.
---
Yeah and that's also kind of problematic. You just have these ridiculously tall/ ridiculously short characters running around and everything looks kinda goofy as a result. Would be better to just have a random slight difference in height between characters, adds a sense of realism and prevents everything from looking like a circus.
---
If you want to hold aggro, sunder more and heroic strike less. Heroic strike is bad because it takes your auto attack and rage and does very little extra damage. Demo shout is also good if you have multiple mobs or have access rage.
---
I remember grinding out those quests and just using the rewards to grind out more, was a decent way to level once you got a flow to it.
---
Using a mod that changes models is a bannable offense. That said I would love to have the option to use the newer graphics.
---
The best part about classic compared to private servers is the fact that as an european I won't have to deal with american idiots like him with all their political bullshit.

"DAE SJW's ruin everything? MAGA!!!"

&gt;Server merging 
---
Please read my comment again. They will need to do it anyway.
---
&gt; Don't forget community is the sole "reason" to be against layering in the first place.
---
That's blatantly untrue. There are many reasons to be against layering. Community is one of them. The main one is the exploits.

You're goddamn right I am

SCHOOOOLS OUT FOR SUMMER
---
Interesting.
---
Well, this is my usual day: Get up, half an hour for bathroom/kitchen making food for breakfast/lunch, 1.5 hours commute (rountrip), 8 hours work, half an hour lunch break, 1 hour shopping/cooking food/eating, 4 hours free time, half an hour wind down/reserve, 8 hours sleep = 24 hours.
---
This includes zero time for laundry, cleaning stuff etc, this takes a few hours on the weekends (plus a longer weekly shopping trip) and this also doesn't include any time spent socializing or irregular stuff like time wasted for bureaucracy like paying bills, vehicle maintenance or whatever. Not sure where you want to shave off 2 hours in there.
---
Bing
---
&gt;I think they should do away with layering and get us back to server queues.
---
I thought that's what they meant when they turn it off after launch. I didn't think it was meant to stop queues indefinitely.
---
Except then I'll just keep rerolling until my character is tall. Or short. So it's the same result.
---
What if when a new person or party of players is placed into a phase it nukes anything server side 20 yds around each group member.  No nodes, no NPCs to fight or die to, no interactable objects.
---
You may be right. But the simplicity of putting in code to restrict 72 hrs playing session is just so much easier. Something tells me if there was a way to hardcode that kind of limiter for other things I am sure we would have done it.
---
Yep I answered a big fucking no to that.
---
Dude is a scam artist
---
Other people in an MMO is a problem? I would love to see the world that busy, You know it will slow down after a few weeks and anyone planning on sticking around more than those few weeks iv spoken to dont have an issue waiting a few days to start playing.
---
Except that's just exactly how it was 15 years ago, and it wasn't that great then. It's hard to FORCE people to roll on a "correct" server. Some will be maxed out, and some relatively empty for the entire leveling period until the merges. then the merges themselves suddenly turn the economy upside down in an instant. people on empty servers will be hoarding mats as well for the merge. and so on
---
You're completely absurd.  I've wasted quite enough time here.
---
WOW kid you just got r/WOOOOOOSHED!!!! 😂😂👀
---
"Wooosh" means you didn't get the joke, as in the sound made when the joke "woooshes" over your head. I bet you're too stupid to get it, IDIOT!! 😤😤😂

My joke was so thoughtfully crafted and took me a total of 3 minutes, you SHOULD be laughing. 🤬 What's that? My joke is bad? I think that's just because you failed. I outsmarted you, nitwit.🤭
---
In conclusion, I am posting this to the community known as "r/Wooooosh" to claim my internet points in your embarrassment 😏. Imbecile. The Germans refer to this action as "Schadenfreude," which means "harm-joy" 😬😲. WOW! 🤪 Another reference I had to explain to you. 🤦‍♂️🤭 I am going to cease this conversation for I do not converse with simple minded persons.😏😂
---
Pretty much level 20 and up zones should not need it. Probably 20% of the player base who start playing will make it past twenty and I feel like that's being generous. By level 20 the gap between leveling speed of different players will also be quite large so I don't see population being that much of an issue at that point.
---
&gt;no, shield for prot warrior stage 6 is not a mistake, take a look at the armor and block values
---
The stats on it from ClassicDB are wrong. [These](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=22819) are the real stats.
---
    Shield of Condemnation
---
    3425 Armor
---
    68 Block
---
    +10 Stamina
---
    (other stats ignored as they are irrelevant)
---
    The Face of Death
---
    3494 Armor
---
    66 Block (Actually 87, with the Equip effect taken into consideration)
---
    +21 Stamina
---
    Equip: Increases your chance to block attacks with a shield by 3%.
---
    Equip: Increases the block value of your shield by 21.
---
No, Shield of Condemnation is not BIS for Warrior tanks.
---
Paladins, slow to level up. It depends. I leveled so many paladins from 1-to-70 that I didn't feel was so slow. Leveling up a paladin, as far as I am concerned, there were no downtime between each mob kill.
---
Upvotes for visibility. These are some really good questions.
---
**Scenario A:** Layering is active and more players join a server, both supply and demand increase.
---
**Scenario B:** Layering is not active and more players join a server, demand increases but supply does not.
---
* Scenario A results in more supply, Scenario B does not. 
---
* The only difference between Scenario A and B is that Layering is active in Scenario A and not active in Scenario B 
---
* Therefore, Laying results in an increase in supply.
---
Well but not every person will be that determined. I think there's a lot of people who, if you give them an obvious height slider they would change their character's height but if you just slightly randomly alter their height upon creation wouldn't really care to remake their character because of that.
---
In MC/BWL the shadowpriest can do decent damage if you're dedicated enough. You won't top the meters but you will be useful. Keep in mind that many spriests do bad damage because they never get any items from the raids. So you have spriests in pre-raid gear trying to compete with people having raid gear. A geared spriest will probably do more dps than many hunters. In my guild all of team lock agreed to supply our spriest with some mana pots and runes to help him out. You can always try that. 
---
They really suffer on longer fights though because they have very little mana regen. We tried to give an innervate to our spriest once just to see how it worked and he shot up to like top 5 dps. Maybe you can convince a feral druid to give you innervate, I doubt it'll work but one can always try eh?
---
First it was only going to be for starter zones then it became entire continents. There's no way we can know they will remove it after Phase 1 or that they won't make it even worse.
---
I understand its usefulness for some things but it can/will cause problems with the social parts of the game, **especially** if they don't put extra restrictions on it to prevent exploiting the system.
---
Beta players have already shown that they can layer hop without any outside help.
---
I'm not sure if that is a bug or not but I experienced that in duskwood a week ago.  I had just used retaliation killing the last of the worsen in that area and retaliation was completely cooled down (30 mins) before repop.  I would say it was 3-5 mins after CD before the entire area repainted instantly.  So, in my experience it was as 30-35 minutes.  I filed a bug on it at the time.
---
Believe me, a lot of people would. Character customization and identity is absolutely top priority for many people.
---
And then the hype dies down, and you have dozens of dead servers. Or, you know, we deal with layering for a few weeks. Get over yourself.
---
I understand that they are going back to it eventually. I don't think layering should ever exist.
---
There is an even bigger exisitng version of this place, in the alpha builds they tried to expend it and it was pretty massive : 
---
 [https://media.moddb.com/images/games/1/1/147/WoW\_Alpha\_Map.jpg](https://media.moddb.com/images/games/1/1/147/WoW_Alpha_Map.jpg) 
---
So you can make this area much bigger ! I wonder what they intended it to be
---
No regerts
---
Thats What I meant
---
They're spoiled. They dont know what it's like to play on servers with 30min+ wait times or on the other end completely barren servers. Or really one sided servers where one faction dominates everything. They think its am easy wait and whatever happens it will be as good as they remember while forgetting what an inconsistent game vanilla all the way up to cata was.
---
Sure, it results in an increase in supply. It also results in an increase in demand, meaning there's effectively no real change.
---
If you love the Horde so much why don't you marry it!?!?
---
Just cuz britney spears is real doesnt mean you cant hang out making music with your friends. If your goal is to get famous off art you have to either have an amazing piece of art or a an amazing amount of money to promote it. Do it up
---
Absolutely not, and yes I get you’re trolling. With as many tattoos I have one more isn’t a big deal, and it’s certainly not my worst one lol. Live happy!
---
Exactly. But it’s more fun to ride the hate train I suppose.
---
Sell it. I believe, some may pay up to 1000 euro
---
it can even go up to level 20 or whatever. there is very little in the way of pvp or valuable mats in those zones.
---
After that no laying/phasing whatsoever, no matter how populated a server gets people will manage to spread out.
---
Imagine a world where a post about how Death Knight could be in Classic has more upvotes than a "layering" sucks post.
---
Thats a really bad argument lol
---
Sure but if the differences are so slight (like in OP's clip, you wouldn't really even instantly recognize that the shorter troll is small if he wasn't standing next to another troll) then I don't think it would be that big of an impact.
---
Dozens, omg what will they do. Tell me why a potential server merge in the future is worse than ruining world pvp?
---
Uh, what? I'm leveling a new character right now, and my /played at level 40 is just about 10 hours. Full heirlooms
---
This is awesome. I'd love to see bis for the less played specs and even options for gear that isn't exactly bis, but close and more easily obtainable.
---
thank you
---
How does layering result in an increase in demand?
---
That’s just not true. On retail there is no challenge or depth. Most people will prefer classic because it’s better designed.
---
You can, but on private servers
---
But custom private servers never work people aren't really interested in them, they prefer blizzlike so modders don't really put much effort
---
....Then they'd just notice it when they DO stand next to one and think "WHat the fuck Blizzard, I'm stuck with this character forever, I cannot change their appearance, and I'm a short shitstack?"
---
\^this
---
As much as I like WoW I kind of hope its just a smash hit and inspires MMO makers in general to try making games with the same "ideals" that old WoW had with how the community and servers work more than I'd want Classic actually expanded, if that makes sense.
---
I'd love to see a modern MMO take a qaulity crack at making an MMO that focuses on the world and community interractions instead of just make the megaserver LFG style of theme park that plagues all the modern ones.
---
The biggest draw for me to play Classic again is more about how the community and servers operated over the game itself, tbh.
---
I didn't even know there was horde questing in ashenvale until well into burning crusade, it just felt so detached from the rest of the questing path.
---
This isn't accurate at all, and I think where a lot of the vitriol about layering stems from. Each server will consist of X0,000 players. Each server will dynamically create a new layer every 3,000 players that enter - the same population cap of servers back in Vanilla. These layers span the entire continent of Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor (I've heard from Blizzard in an interview that the layers even go across the continents as well.) Moving to another zone does not move you to another layer.  
---
These layers are scheduled to be removed ASAP, no later than the implementation of Phase 2. The purpose of layering is to combat the inevitable rush of players that will only play the game for a few days. These tourists will create a server boom that steadily declines, which would cause server populations to be incredibly low post launch. Layering fixes that somewhat by allowing merges to be simple, and by Phase 2 we will have servers with higher populations than Classic ever had.
---
Gotta beta test those fishing bots
---
They've stated that they want a mix of people, that'll include what they think are very new players. They don't know that your old account was banned for botting.
---
But how would they know you better before?
---
I'm confused; isn't the layering stuff only to be used in the starting zones at launch? Based on the outcry of people here I have a feeling there is something I've missed.
---
I agree. I don't like to take Blizzards word for anything, they have a very bad track record.
---
Edit: Let me elaborate. When they do give details, they have been known to change their minds later.
---
wonder if it can be expanded a bit for a 2nd or 3d item per slot that's not bis but *really* close.
---
That was his wife

OP is asking if Vanilla had healing numbers over the targets character when healer.

In Vanilla this does not exist. (I believe healing received is displayed over character portraits.)
---
However the Mod "Scrolling Combat Text" has options to allow you to put numbers anywhere on your screen with scrolling text if that is acceptable enough for you.
---
I'm actually European myself but keep the assumptions flowing my friend
---
But you have to have it equipped and you need them to do decent dps. I think they should be there.
---
Thanks, I appreciate this kind of humour a lot.
---
Ahh yeah forgot I ran into it at the worgens as well. Dark Runners were a pain in the ass to complete because of this.
---
The numbers *are* important. An add on like MiksScrollingCombatText can tell you how much you overhealed for. That’s important information.
---
Sorry to break it to you but retail's server tech heavily favours the lagger in just about every possible situation
---
CRZ error text
---
Honestly, people like you ruin the game.  You admit to bitting for gold which ruins the economy like it's nothing.  You were permanently banned, and yet you think it's okay to just make another account?  
---
I have spent $3000 dollars on WoW tokens for my professions and gear before raid week, and everyone should you're no different.  The fact that you got into classic makes me furious and I'm just shitting out of my ass here, was a new account so there's no previous ban on it.  Have fun playing classic.
---
Yeah comparing it to retail is kind of a moot point seeing as anyone can summon anyway. In classic, being able to summon is one of the big reasons you'd invite a lock over a mage.
---
Guess we'll see boss but I'm pretty much always right.
---
why fast? because its obviously a huge issue. the longer they dont acknowledge or fix it, the longer people will think Blizz doesnt care or doesnt see it as an issue.
---
yes, they need a proper fix.  but saying its beta and they have 3 months to fix is a poor argument. especially since people reported problems in BaF beta that were never acknowledged or corrected.  assuming Blizz knows and is doing something because there is plenty of time so dont worry - no, with their recent track record they dont get that luxury
---
players have been showing ways to exploit layering, or how layering isnt working correctly for weeks. the longer these exploits exist without any change, the more likely it seems blizz has decided 'its just how it is', but hey, layering will be gone in phase 2, right?!?!
---
How do you know?
---
The grinds in vanilla are way more satisfying because it is a higher reward  from the grind. That HOTW won't be replaced until about AQ40 time frame so that long time spent grinding to make the item is well worth it in the long run.
---
WTF
---
Dude, I just wanna say, this website is so dope. How difficult was this to do? What’s your tech stack?
---
There was a song by someone I can't remember the whole thing but at one point the lyric was sung by a woman "Ride my Kodo I'm 40 only 20 to go". Anyone know what that's from?
---
If that's all it takes for you to not be able to play classic, you probably weren't making it far anyway.
---
It's silly to assume they can't make layering less aggressive
---
I was fire for all of vanilla, but went frost/arcane in BC.
---
I used to duel my frost specced friend all of the time and just melt him.
---
Layering only kicks in when there's a high server population, and each layer holds up to a normal server population's worth of players. If there's multiple layers resulting in higher supply, then there's also a higher population creating a higher demand.
---
No. Instead, I’ll be grinding Baron Rivendare endlessly by tanking strat UD runs with the mount on reserve.
---
Probably still never see it drop but oh well
---
Layering is doing the same functional thing as new servers. From a hardware standpoint, there's no reason they can't have a server (hardware) run multiple realms (software). The issue isn't money, because it wouldn't take any more money to have more realms.
---
I like the undead rogue stealthing by, and the implied "I hope he's not looking at me, that would be great"
---
Yahoo
---
Could you sell it?  I thought it was account bound.  I got the beta invite day 1 and it showed up in my battle.net app automatically.  All you could do with it is install and play.
---
Preventing dozens of Dead servers, leading to even more die off, is worth more than your WPvP experience being stifled for a single fucking phase. Once again, get the fuck over yourself. Intentional ignorance isn’t a good look on anyone, and if you genuinely can’t see how layering is a better option, then I honestly feel sorry for you.
---
OSRS has trained me for things like this.
---
Personally, I would like to see PvP bis outside the sets. Can't seem to find anything for warlocks, the pieces to cop in PvE for pvp ;)
---
As someone that is going to level as a BM Hunter, this makes me happy.
---
Id have been happy to not get past level 2 on the first day, Hell the first week even. I had planned on sticking around with classic wow making it my only game so whats 1/2 weeks out of years and years of playing? Small potatos. 
---
On the other hand letting Blizzard do what they please with the server without any pushback or having them put any thought into it sets a terrible underlying precedent that Blizzard can screw with the servers at any time for any reason. After putting my arguement forward and getting shouted down by people who wont play past the first month I have no intrest in playing anymore and it makes me feel sad.
---
I dont care about live players not getting to play day 1 I honestly dont becasue these people will only call for terrible changes time and time again going forward.
---
you can't critisize layering
---
Yes, but that higher demand would be there regardless of whether or not layering is active.
---
The increase in demand is not caused by layering.
---
You’re assuming that blizzard will leave the servers dead for along time before merging. 
---
Cheer up buttercup
---
If you're looking at all the classes, the most gear dependent will be the melee. Melee weapons the single most impactful items in the game.
---
If we're comparing casters, Mages are probably the most gear dependent, because they rely more on higher spell coefficients. In other words, most of their dps comes from spells with longer cast times, therefore spell power is more impactful for them. 
---
Useful reference: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/95abc8/list_of_spellcoefficients_1121/
---
Casters with more instant spells and short cast times (Spriests, Locks) will benefit less from spell power because the majority of their spells are instants/faster casts. (PvE Locks are a different story because they spam longer cast time spells. But in PvP where dots are the primary tool, spell power is less impactful).
---
In the end, I don't think you're going to feel a significant difference in gear dependence between the casters (and hunter) at 60, assuming you're in blues. There is actually decent balance at that point in the game. They're all going to be serviceable. I would pick between them based on playstyle and skill. Mage has a very low skill floor (average mages are bad in pvp, but exceptional mages are awesome), whereas lock/hunter have much higher skill floors.
---
worth lol
---
Always felt like wooshing is the dumbest way to answer. You either correct person or explain where they missed something or just move on. Seing those woosh answers is just feels toxic
---
Yeah, Wetlands, Redridge, and Duskwood. It's a little excessive. That's a very carefree levelling experience for the Alliance.
---
Then again I don't really give a shit about PVP. I'm just sayin.
---
Play a Hunter and just always be standing on a frost trap.
---
I actually quit (again) a few days ago. Like the game is still great but i get burned out too quickly. I'll play when ordilita is released to check it out but atm I'm just looking forward to classic :)
---
Says the guy farming downvotes on Reddit.
---
No, it is not a terrible idea. And since November 2017, I expressed my opinion that while Classic is a very good game, it cannot last for long without a continuation. And that continuation cannot be a repeat of former expansions, for multiple strong reasons. I also realized also since November 2017 that BfA will be a disaster (personal loot, removal of PvP realms, new Azerite Power system - all were announced at Blizzcon 2017) and it is too gone to be saved.
---
A WoW2 can only become reality in two scenarios : either both Classic and live WoW fail, either Classic is booming and live WoW fails.
---
If they are both fine, Blizzard won't see any point to make a WoW2. If Classic fails, and live is fine, again, no point to make a WoW2.
---
Now, if Classic is much more popular than live, and since live is really beyond salvation, a WoW2 can simply be an alternate route with Classic as the base game.
---
If both Classic and live fail, WoW2 will have to be a fucking amazing game to save what is left of the WoW franchise.
---
I, personally, don't see Classic failing. Quite the opposite, I see Classic as being 3-4 times more popular than live. The question is : will Blizzard build a WoW2 based on Classic game design philosophy, or build an entire new game, while keeping Classic as a museum?
---
Every time I see something from the arena, it looks like a streamer is getting help from a follower. Streamer loot prio, or something of the sort.
---
Yeah, they are currently led by a moustache twirling evil Sylvanas. Now, the general who led and planned the attack with her, OG Saurfang, came to his senses and broke off to rebel against her. The worst thing is that Tyrande and the Night Elves went through some transformation of Elune to become "Night Warrior" and now they have black eyes, and are filled with vengeance - but they can't even kill Nathanos Blightcaller, Sylvanas' right hand man, or anyone important, along with Malfurion doing nothing. 
---
It's awful writing, honestly I am probably making it sound better than if you were to watch and play in game.
---
Who were you?
---
&gt; I have spent $3000 dollars on WoW tokens for my professions and gear before raid week 
---
people like you is the reason the gaming industry looks like what it does today, lol
---
Layering is literally just a continent-wide shard. The only reason they renamed it is because sharding came with such bad PR.
---
You have to sell your battle account I believe
---
Is this a copypasta? There's such a thin line between parody and insanity I cannot tell anymore.
---
It's not a design issue it's a dev and programming issue. Design issues are AP gear and HoA things. Dev issues are disappearing nodes or bad sharding.
---
Yes

Hey everyone, happy to be returning!

---
I believe I'll be focusing on 5 man dungeons at 60 and then will be extremely interested in giving raids a shot. Although I'll admit I have essentially 0 raiding experience as I only hit 60 on my lock while Naxx was already released.
---
I've only played a healer (shammy) in Cata and only pvp'd lightly before unsubbing so I'm not the most experienced priest or healer but look forward to learning from scratch and would be thrilled to join a guild that fosters learning as I'll surely be reading and watching guides to prep.
---
Intended playtimes can be any night (CST 6pm-11pm) other than Thurs/Sundays, quite flexible aside from those while weekend can be anything really.
---
I was an avid PVPer in vanilla through TBC and arenas reaching 2k+ so I'd always be up for rolling BGs (would be a dream come true to hit exalted with Defilers) or wPvP. Additionally I'd be more than happy to group up and do various world items whether that's dungeon runs with guildies or w/e!
---
Please DM me if I'd be a fit for your guild, I'd really appreciate it!
---
Thanks in advance
---
Is this fresh pasta?
---
daily?  Try more like repeating the same quest over and over again for weeks until you reach exalted... saying daily makes people think of daily quests which didn't exist in classic.
---
Ah. Yea. But if it's only active for like a month the long term effect won't be bad. Maybe implement a limit of how often you can swap layers during that period or something.
---
But I do think layering needs to exist when 3000 people are level 1 trying to kill boars in the starting areas at the same time given vanilla spawn and drop rates. The alternative is thousands of people sit in queues the entire launch day and that is not fun for anyone.
---
Ask Jeeves
---
Oh boy the 18th time today.
---
I don't think that matters too much, lots of people are going to go wherever their favorite streamer goes.  You are going to have server pops of like 50k players in 5 layers on the same realm if you don't hard cap the amount of people that can be logged into a server at one time.  
---
I hope you are right honestly, but we have already been dealing with the technology they are going to use, it's just implemented differently in retail...and we all know that shit is hot garbage.  
---
You go 10 feet and all of a sudden layer 3 isn't needed anymore and all the mobs disappear and there are 20 people appearing out of thin air.  That shit is terrible.
---
Don't worry only insecure children say woosh.
---
&gt; This brings me to the question why is everyone so against classic wow with bfa visuals? 
---
If they are going to update some graphics (like player characters), they would have to update everything in the game, otherwise it would look totally out of place with modern models in a low poly world and stuff like that. Like they would have to go over all the models, textures, terrain, etc. in the entire game and update them to a somewhat consistent graphical quality. It would be a huge undertaking, probably more work than porting all of classic has been so far. 
---
And no one cares enough about the graphics to want Blizzard to spend months updating them. Would much rather have them work on rereleasing TBC and Wrath for example.
---
They did do some stuff like that in Cata, but nowhere near everything was affected, creating some weird inconsistencies in quality in the old world. I think they are still continually updating the textures on some creature types too.
---
Yeah I got one this morning, made sure that they know Classic is the go to game
---
What do you recommend?
---
DuckDuckGo
---
I appreciate your level headed take on this. Too bad most of the thread devolved  into "classic is dead, blizzard sucks".
---
You should not avoid Winterspring if you want to easily hit 60.
---
&gt; That's my point when top guilds are funneling gear loot and speed/farm runs of dungeons and hit Max level before anyone else
---
Dungeons have **NOTHING** to do with layering.
---
&gt; can abuse this sharding mechanic to corner markets on items long before they have competition
---
This doesn't make sense, because mobs have to actually drop items still. People will compete for that farm, too - it's not hard as a Mage to go spam Rank 1 Arcane Explosion to tag a group of mobs so I can Blizzard them all down.
---
&gt; Where as the average person will not have access to this level of coordination
---
The average person also doesn't realistically care about sharding in the first place. 
---
The sky isn't going to fall, and the markets are going to be fine. Stop panicking over nothing.
---
They said layering would be P1 only
---
Please add Mace spec rogue.
---
And how does this eliminate the queue problem they're trying to solve when the vast majority of a server isn't being layered and the tourists haven't left yet?
---
On my Druid I've had many clutch moments of warstomp --&gt; regrowth/healing touch. I'd imagine the same thing goes for Shaman with warstomp --&gt; healing wave. And cosidering that you're going ele/resto that would fit even better. Still, its cooldown is long enough for it to not be op. Honestly, I'd go with aesthetic preferences.
---
Bold of you to assume Blizzard will do anything about an obvious issue with one of their games.
---
So you could say Desolace feels...desolate?
---
Paladins will cleanse every Dot and fear with a single button. Alliance lock is not disadvantaged.
---
Moot point you can't even start it at 50
---
Each layer is 100% seperate. That's why you get two nodes and such. What you're saying is how it works.
---
The streamers need it. When wow launches soda and asmons servers wont have the 50% above the 3k layer limit that will settle after a week. it will be like 30k or more that will join their servers and it would be a big mess if all these people werent layered.
---
4-5 WHAT
---
As s gnome yes, too. Gnomes look best on Kodos and Cats.
---
They are planning on removing it ASAP. It's scheduled to be gone "no later than" Phase 2. As soon as a server is reduced to 3000 players, that's it. No more layers.  
---
If you want layers to be gone faster, gatekeep harder. It's the only way. ^^^/s
---
Basically shattering the illusion of being in a single world.
---
&gt; Maybe it's cause I play on RP servers
---
The population of high levels _won't_ be three times as high. Layering aims to fix the extreme overpopulation due to tourists, who will quit long before reaching a level where they can participate in these events.
---
The game has had that issue since forever. Kind of ironic to compare a solo grind to waiting to do group content when most people in here would chastise retail players for solo mentality.
---
And if your guild uses DKP the Rogues always collude and take turns on loot so they get everything for 1 DKP. When they get called out they'll claim they're RPing.
---
He used to be a guild leader on a private server years ago. Smooth McGuild.
---
I spent 120 hours collecting silithid carapace fragments on a private server to get my black qiraji battle tank, maybe the wintersaber grind is possible after all...
---
I know it's a bit ridiculous and most won't see the problem, bit SCT has never felt right to me. Shame they won't add something so innocuous. Thanks for the reply.
---
Its literally going to keep private servers relevant and I honestly don't want that anymore.  I want a place my character will be that I can pay for support and not have as many corrupt admins.
---
Yeah, which is exactly why feedback like this is warranted. Engineers are paid to think from an engineering perspective, not from a gameplay experience perspective. When a technological "solution" to a problem is being considered that negatively impacts the player's experience, it is absolutely justified to provide them with that feedback.
---
İt's not forever, its till wow servers are down. Do you know whats a better investment? Learn something you can learn that will improve your life till you die.
---
&gt;Im just not sure why areas like the arena have different layers  
---
It doesn't. The entire continent is on a single layer. If you want the arena to have its own layers, that would be sharding.
---
Oh no buddy, it was a joke.
---
If you click your own Nessa Shadowsong link, it will show you the relevant quest chains on the right side bar thing.
---
Everyone's different I suppose. I love arathi highlands. It's green vast hills, verity of mobs. 
---
I never liked ashenvale though. Tis a silly place
---
And they said a few weeks into the release, so not at all unplausible that it's removed in time.
---
Prepare to be disappointed.
---
Shroud of Pure Thought (BWL, off one of the drakes) is quite a bit better, a touch less healing, but the MP5 stat is phenomenal. That being said, one of the first farms I plan on hitting is Larval Acids. As a leatherworker, when Hide of the Wild pattern first hit, I think I sold ten of them, and made more than enough to kit out my alt with an epic mount.
---
I'll take the word of the guy whose actually working on it over the gut feeling of a rando
---
Had to think about where that was for a second but when I did the noise I made imagining that scared the cat.
---
I was fire til MC forced the switch.  Made me a sad panda having a rotation consist of nothing but frostbolt spam

---
Well it’s mostly toxic children here, sooo
---
you won't have the weapons for it, no way you are getting 1h drops &gt; rogues.
---
That's going to happen regardless of layers. Streamers are going to get "world first" on almost everything because classic is not that complicated and they have legions of people who will help them. Layers or not, it's going to happen.
---
Best you can do is not play on their realm and get server first.
---
Why would I be disappointed?  I haven't played this game seriously since wotlk or at all since mop.  I like classic I'd be happy if more people liked it for longer.
---
Layering is a very damaging solution to a very minor problem AKA i dont want to have to wait for anything, not even quests in a game thats about the journey not the destination
---
If I am not mistaken, Nessa chain is pretty short. You are maybe missing out on 1000 exp flying back and forth. Not very much in the scheme of things. Just go kill 10 moonkins and you’ve caught up
---
They didn't really give a straight answer. They said it would definitely be removed before phase 2 as that contains world bosses. Their goal is to remove it as quickly as possible, but the only deadline they've set is phase 2.
---
Two of those 4 Warriors were leveled in Vanilla to 60. One of each faction and main tanked on both of them.
---
I'm just stating that I have experience with Warriors far more than any class and I just don't get the stigma against them in terms of leveling.
---
Objectively they are slow, but subjectively to me I could get a Warrior to 60 faster than most classes in Vanilla.
---
these are great!
---
Get home, Set queue to start, Use that time to chill with the family, cook and eat get washed then sit down for a couple hours play before bed. 
---
That was my plan and it would have worked. Unfortunatly with Blizzard shitting all over the game permantly via layering and messing with the servers when ever they feel like all intrest from my group of friends has been lost. I guess you getting to log in and play day 1 for 2 hours is more important than healthly servers though. Enjoy! For all of the 2 weeks you play.

---
I saw graphite on the loot table.
---
&gt; I really hate how much their server architecture has regressed.
---
LOL.  Only reddit armchair engineers would look at zoning/layering as "server architecture regression".
---
Zoning/Layering is good tech, it can support a WAY higher load of concurrent players.  It just has an undesirable effect on the gameplay/design of an MMO and what we all want in a community.  But that definitely isn't architecture regression...
---
What misinformation? They've said both a few weeks into release and before phase 2, we don't know which one will happen. I get that you want any reason to think Classic is doomed, but it really isn't. You also don't know what limitations they'll put on layering. Maybe world buffs will be server wide and not layer wide, who knows? Stop acting like the beta is the released game.
---
That makes no sense. The economy hasn't even started yet. 
---
We don't even know if 1g in Classic will be worth the same as 1g in Vanilla after taking so many factors into consideration.
---
they said there was a possibility they were gonna use the ingame store for that and only that because there are no webservices anymore. these people are just trying to start some drama.
---
I did it back in Vanilla. I *want* to do it again... but I don't know if I have the willpower these days. It's a *looong* grind.
---
Imagine subbing just to get an invite and then complaining about getting an invite. Get over yourself. Show proof that all of this is real.
---
You were there right?
---
Easy bro make servers have a pop cap like they did in VANILLA.  Thats the solution go back to having actual servers man thats what made Vanilla great.
---
Peplexity's accent is definitely not Liverpool...

This is marvelous fresh copy pasta
---
There has to be a better name for an Azeroth based paper though. Perhaps “The Stormwind Flyer” or something.
---
Well the lower hub is so far away, i never bother to walk there 😂
---
If you enjoy tanking then go with the Warrior. 
---
Forget about Thunderfury though unless you're a tryhard main tank with 100% raid attendance and/or a very charismatic person.
---
It’s EA behind Blizzard. You know they will force the issue at some point. Esp. if it’s popular.
---
Blizzard should higher you.
---
No good thing should be earned quickly.
---
Miss, miss, miss, miss... haha
---
&gt; How would it be? If a server is averaging 10k people online then demand for goods will be drastically higher than a server that averages 2k people online.
---
The point of my argument isn't to compare a low pop server that doesn't have layering active with a high pop server that does.
---
What I'm trying to get across is that if Blizzard launches Classic WoW with layering active, high pop servers are going to have more supply than if Blizzard launches Classic WoW without layering active.
---
Classic servers are like ogres.
---
I'll write a gui interface in visual basic. See if i cant track an IP address.
---
Merged servers also kill server identity. Also how do you handle same names o  different servers. This is not a catch all solution either.
---
I loved how swtor handled "the same class just different faction" thing. That is exactly what I'm getting at with sunwalkers and it's really the only way to make them work for Horde without blood elves.
---
Do we need to upvote every single "layering sucks" thread? 
---
No - most of the opinions are rehashed and honestly just reactionary. It's a fucking beta, let them beta test it. Every single person upset with layering doesn't need to make a unique post about it with what they think are their own unique solutions/issues.
---
Get fucked. All you retards who accepted layering as okay brought this on yourselves. Enjoy your repackaged sharding aka layering from day 1 to day 1000.
---
Keep rationalizing layering and downvote me. I really don’t care how Classic turns out anymore.
---
I think it’s satire man
---
I know right this subs a bunch of employed people with children running around. Buncha babies!
---
The amount of lack of knowledge about servers and load balancing in this thread is staggering. 
---
"Just put in more servers, don't be so cheap" - Never mind that is exactly what layering is. The easiest solution (and probably worst) is that they make a bunch of servers, hope people split between them evenly (they won't) and then when populations dip, merge servers, with name conflicts being damned. They can make it work, force one server to "transfer" to the other, and someone gets screwed. But here's the thing, blizzard isn't doing that because they want people to stick around so they are working on a better solution.
---
See, I"m not against more content. Especially content before 60. This right here is why people need to be open to new content in the vanilla spirit. It doesn't always have to be "Post-Naxx content" to be new content.
---
I think the advantage is exponential (if abused) and the gap isn't so big that it cant be over come. If a server has X amount if theoretical mats on it, a server with layers has X(Y) amount of mats where Y is the number of layers. So a very low pop server would have zero chance of competing with a server that someone like Asmongold plays on. Hypothetically speaking at least.
---
Ha! I ran about 150 times strat never saw it drop .. I used to ran it solo on the next expansions a few times as well, no luck ... same with tiger and raptor from ZG
---
You won't. Layer shifts only occur when you use group joining shenanigans with someone not in your layer or travel through a loading screen.
---
I did bloodsail and furbolg for the trinket. Wouldn't bother with latter.
---
&gt;Working off of the assumption that they'll NOT do what they've said they will is actually absurd.
---
Im sorry did you miss all of BFA? Or fuck all of Blizzards lifespan past WOTLK?
---
Its super hard to add stuff in to a game that is considered "perfectly unbalanced" you add a class that is balanced and thats already OP because no one eles is balanced, you don't and people will get mad you added a class with only 1 viable spec.
---
Or over 30, but its same shit I guess. Damn I am old.
---
&gt; I hope you are right honestly, but we have already been dealing with the technology they are going to use, it's just implemented differently in retail...and we all know that shit is hot garbage.
---
This is like saying using an iPhone as your professional coding platform is the same as using a Windows desktop.
---
They're both fundamentally "computers" with "operating systems", but the situation is not the same.
---
Layering uses the fundamental principle of sharding, and nothing more. As well as being temporary to solve a specific problem.
---
There is no cross-realm, no discontinuity between zones, and no multiple versions of world bosses, etc. (when implemented as intended)
---
&gt; You go 10 feet and all of a sudden layer 3 isn't needed anymore and all the mobs disappear and there are 20 people appearing out of thin air. That shit is terrible.
---
Again, this is down to implementation choice. This is not a given, you're just assuming that would happen, and it's not an inherent property of the idea.
---
They haven't been explicit about what the idea is for situations of 1 full layer and 1 deserted layer, or if there should be any dynamic 'load-balancing' or whatever.
---
But clearly from the principle of why they're pursuing this, they wouldn't intend for that to be the scenario.
---
For example, they originally said they'd only want you to (potentially) swap layers if you changed continent. You shouldn't just randomly swap layers in the middle of doing something, or between two touching zones.
---
I will reiterate though, it is temporary, on the order of a few weeks, as a solution to the launch surge.
---
As a Hunter, I think it's better to try and get the jump on people. Trying to avoid them probably won't save me. The more you PvP, the more you learn.
---
Ty.... That's about what I've been able to gather as well....or if they are affected, it takes an absurd amount of spell power to make a difference
---
The easiest way would be to go to that faction's starting zone at lvl 1. You will get reputation as you quest and level up.
---
Later, it's not hard, it's just expensive. You can donate a ton of cloth for rotation.
---
It doesn't. For some reason someone gave mongos license to use internet and here we are.
---
This doesn't preserve a server's community/identity.  Layering makes it so you could/should see the same people questing in STV, that you saw at level 5 in Elwynn.
---
They operate on a for-profit basis. Of course they are going to find a way to monetize Classic. As well they should find a way to generate more income.
---
&gt; The tourists will mostly stay on lower levels. 
---
As a potential "tourist", I don't think so. I'm going to play with a bunch of my retail guildies on release. But a lot of them say they are only "trying it out", and even I am not certain how long I will stay for classic. But I can't imagine me getting burned out before level 20, that's like 12 hours played or something, right? And I can't imagine my guildies getting out that early either, considering how much some of them can play (12 hours in a day is not unreasonable if we're excited for something). 
---
Most likely I will either get to 60 and run some dungeons, then quit (what I've been doing on pservers in the past). Or I will get tired of levelling somewhere between mid 30s to late 40s.
---
&gt;I believe Blizzard should find a way to deal with issues in a way that doesn't hurt the play experience.
---
And this was their solution. Mostly in response to classic fans worrying about the community experience and server population health (which was never an issue in classic due to the constantly growing population. They could have just implemented regular sharding and called it a day, but instead they went out of their way to do something more large scale so that players aren't just phasing in and out all the time (you have to relog or join a party to get phased now, and even then it's not certain). 
---
It has drawbacks, of course, but it's not much compared to what would happen with alternatives. No matter what we do (out of the ideas that I've heard of), there are going to be issues, so we got to choose which we prefer, blizzard chose layering. And while I'm not 100% sold on layering, I would much prefer that over "no changes" in this instance (which would cause massive "changes" to server communities, so not really #nochanges if you think about it).
---
Sida’s quest is better in a group. I go in the crypt and kill the bigger ones and everyone gets the bag at the same time. The mobs are all piled up and you can grind through them really fast.
---
&gt;What I'm trying to get across is that if Blizzard launches Classic WoW with layering active, high pop servers are going to have more supply than if Blizzard launches Classic WoW without layering active.
---
Yes, and the point I'm making is that there will also be higher demand to match the higher supply since the higher supply only happens where's a higher population. A server with 2k people online with no layers will have the exact same supply and demand as a server with 4k people online divided into 2 layers.
---
Kala is my favorite beta streamer.
---
5 days game play.. long time
---
Fuck no.
---
He also said BFA would be good but hey I guess thats none of my business.
---
Throw more dots!
---
It's so tragic that they decided to add segregated new islands to the game instead of filling out and adding to the existing one, and blending it in with the world. The sense of world and community is what made vanilla great. Having low level places next to high level places made the world seem alive.
---
Its beta, theres still even stress tests left to be done. And its 2 months away from release. This isnt a game design problems it's a tech problem. This is how they're resolved.
---
Here's my defense: it'll be gone as soon as populations are low enough that layering isn't necessary.
---
120 hrs playing 4 hours daily means 1 calendar month if you play daily.
---
Honestly, i feel like blizzard has the layering system set to 11 so they can test is as much as they can. im glad that they are so we can ask questions and critique it. I want to know how many people can be on each Layer? Are they artificially lowering it to test it in the beta? What plans do they have to punish people who will abuse it, i can see people in very large guilds or streamers with large groups of followers flooding into a zone to force layering and using it for EZ farming what are the plans to combat the bad parts of it?
---
We need answers to this so we know what to expect how they will handle it
---
Thus far Blizzard has been uncharacteristically true to their word on all things Classic. 
---
So I’m going to choose to believe that since they’ve said they’re going to stay true to what Classic was and not add any type of shop, that they will do exactly that.
---
You can't be serious...I mean, have you ever experienced a realm merge? Probably not.
---
It's not about the servers not being able to handle the amount of people, it's about the server actually being somewhat playable. Blizzlike is not 15k pop, and a 15k pop is fucking awful.
---
For anyone even mentioning 15k pop as a plausible option, just look at this shitshow. It was like this around every single creep spot.
---
https://imgur.com/a/NRVOkRz
---
Almost nobody has that mount. I think that there was only one guy on my server back in the day that had it.
---
Yea its true. However, this is the mentality that makes you never implement anything into the game. And classic cannot be stuck at post-naxx content forever, it needs to move on by taking risks with each new content being released
---
months
---
I remember when cross realm bgs was released, it dramatically reduced que times. But it was really server then battle group dependant, I was on Akama and horde had pretty short bg ques.
---
Yea it fucking will do great maybe not for you but those games have millions of players and take in money. Maybe it's not great for you nut they dont only make games for you.
---
The big question is, how the fuck do you justify a server event where there’s a FFA to loot ONE chest and then completely ruin the whole aspect of the event by allowing layering to happen here? Who’s the bonehead?
---
&gt; cause true fans to second-guess
---
No, it'll cause "some" fans.  Not "true" fans.  Plenty of people won't second guess their decision and they're just as much "true" fans as people who will.
---
&gt; potentially return to private servers.
---
Yeah, avoid the Blizzard version for a private version that likely has modifications (and definitely has exploits of its own), and those are the "true" fans.  Hmm.
---
I mean, come on, people, if you're going to try to use gatekeeping terminology, at least say something that makes sense.
---
Are swords/mageblades really the bis for mages??
---
 I said this thread, not this post. Yes a lot of people agree with your general sentiment of "layering is bad." I don't see anyone agreeing with your argument of "Layering saves them money because making epics tradable saves them money."
---
After playing a pserver with 20K online layering is a terrible option.
---
True...i don't play on a RP server, so maybe your community is a little tighter. With sharding, i find myself rarely grouping with characters from my own server. i'm more of a casual player now, so I'll own some of the disconnection with the community.
---
That would be post-classic content, are we not talking about classic. 
---
&gt; Now just imagine a VANILLA VERSION   
---
&gt; Ah a boy can dream about playing a lvl 60 night elf DH
---
so night elves don't have to grind as much for this?
---
Need to ask for source on this. Genuinely curious but I need the real evidence.
---
There are already a bunch of videos of it being abused and weird stuff happening, enjoy.
---
Congrats, you earned that downvote
---
Classic reddit: We want old AV that lasts for days!
---
Blizzard: heres an AV test that will last several days.
---
Also classic reddit: We dont want AV for days, thats boring!
---
Thanks for this. I hate it.
---
This isn't what you asked but I would advise against looking at census data when making a class choice. Play what you enjoy and excel at it. You will stand out above the crowd even if there are a lot of them. 
---
Your social networking strategy and learning the intricacies or your class will be a more valuable analysis than looking at census data.
---
I forget...can horde get this?
---
Trying to understand your mess of an argument.
---
It's also one of the major issues the classic community has with live. A blue post here to clarify things would go a long way, because the current situation looks really bad.
---
thank you for your report, please consider posting your experiences in the official forum and/or bugreports.
---
since there is still a timeframe of more then 2 month blizzard can fix the issues you describted.
---
after all thats what an beta test is for, to find bugs and broken mechanics to fix before the release.
---
people seem to forget that development is an iterative process which needs testing
---
Can you link a video to 12k launch? Even if people were divided evenly that would still be 2k+ per starting zone and I have never ever seen anything even close to that.
---
Like I said a lot of people in this particular thread obviously don't speak English as a first language so it would be hard for them to understand.
---
People get stuck in the reddit circlejerk and think they're the big dogs.
---
Thanks, I know it's part of a chain, but there are situations where not doing a chain precludes you from doing different chains down the road, which is what I'm trying to figure out.
---
You and me both buddy.
---
I'll put you in my top 8 and make you listen to Chumbawumba every time you come to my profile.
---
Won't matter. The only difference is there will be xlayer amout of devilsaur leather, if respawn time is the same as on privates. No devilsaur mafia. And probably the same amount of other resourses or less, because of no dynamic spawns for herbs/nodes/elementals/etc.
---
Mainly casual player that just wants to play PVE content with friends, maybe the occasional PVPing. Was thinking of rolling a mage or night elf rogue. Honestly just looking to have fun and blow off steam
---
I have a problem with writing paragraphs when I actually have something to say lol. So I wouldn't overly focus on the amount of words.
---
The vanilla record is 4 days and 20 hours, or 116 hours
---
I remember running to WC instance having to dodge all the mobs, you're right...those were the good times.
---
Do you know what oxymoron means?
---
YEARS
---
True. But that's how high pop vs low pop was in vanilla anyways. And during launch all servers are going to be packed and all servers will have same player cap. I'm pretty sure server capacity isn't increased as there are more layers. So high pop servers where asmongold will be will still just longer queues than others.
---
That’s shows up there too, there are none listed so there are likely none if it is correct
---
I don't think so. You could write a lot back then, once the algorithm got figured out.
---
The problem here is that you don't understand the problem, nor the solution (layering).
---
The problem is tourists, who are per definition all low level. The solution is layering, which duplicates _all_ content, not just low level content.
---
Now, I have no idea what "the #nochanges crowd" has to do with anything, I suspect you just brought it up to score circlejerk points, but hopefully you now understand why demand would indeed not meet supply.
---
I loaded my alpha client and here's how it looks like in game

---
Yea, I played on Silvermoon forever.  We got Merged with Mok'nathal, still struggling to keep a squad together.  Needs another merge.
---
Exactly as was originally planned, iirc...
---
Sharding technically is cross server as well
---
LMK, that sounds awesome. You talk on Josh's Podcast once in a while, ya?
---
The grind was bad but easy . What made it worse was other farmers and pvp . PvP was fun at least ...
---
Dodging the opposing faction is fun too :P
---
I used to hang around SM near undercity and gank Allies trying to get to the dungeon haha
---
Minus the part where 100 people might raid arathi or stv or tarrenmull or gadgetzan and crash the area for any poor bastard trying to play.
---
it slays the mmo in mmorpg
---
It is a minor problem. New players won't stay long if they can't level up in the starting zones.
---
I'm 100% sure the boost is about BFA though, there is a question about level scaling, it would make sense rather than a "ion lied once again" like argument as they said server transfert were the most they may ever include
---
Seems like the best option to me. Just make more servers and squish em together as needed. Do people really care about having to make a slight name change that much?
---
AOL
---
Oh beautiful! Thanks
---
The warrior thing is greatly overestimated, he gives me way too many days.
---
Crendor if  streams it.
---
There are no good staves in Phase 1 (Zum'rah's Vexing Cane is the best you can get and it's level 41). 1h and offhand is better.
---
It's wrong as fuck, yeah.
---
Correct. you could only turn in like 2 quests per day. This grind took weeks, but it was the coolest NE mount.
---
I DON'T LIKE THING, THING BAD
---
Oh, if the servers has a specific amount of players that can be on them at any given time, then I change my stance. My understanding is that layers would remove queue times all together and that as players logged into a server, more and more layers would be generated to accomodate the player load.
---
it is developed for the chinese market, they love mobile shit and with an aprox market of 700million Smartphones compared to the 1,8billion in the rest of the world.
---
so yeah diablo mobile will be a cashcow
---
I played at Vanilla launch and got sucked into making alts all the time. Never hit max level. I think 42 was my highest level character until I came back for TBC. I saw they were going to release Classic and didn't think much of it. About a week before the release date was announced, I started reading more and more about it. Now I'm sucked in. Watching the Beta. Reading this sub all day at work... I'm really looking forward to doing all the things that I missed out on back in the day.
---
Are you honestly serious?
---
What is going on at the moment, is the game released or is it in this closed testing phase one normally refers to as *a beta*? The kind of situation were things are tested and iterated on, and testers are recruited to spot bugs and give feedback?
---
Do you expect them not to try to implement this at all, and just immediately give up, despite the many upsides?
---
***Obviously*** I would want them to pull the plug and go back to the 'default' position of tons of servers and queues, if they can't get layering into the intended state before launch.
---
***But*** I want them, and am giving them the benefit of the doubt, to try to iterate on the idea during the ***testing phase***.
---
Because most players are unlikely to even level past 15. Is blizzard planning on having layering last only the first week.
---
Having layering in the starer zones affects players of all levels. That should not happen.
---
Go to retail then.
---
Should check Wowhead classic version, and ClassicDB to make sure, I usually check two out of the three cus stuff tends to be off quite often on all three...
---
It’s amazing to wonder if blizzards intentions were for some of these quest lines to be so arduous or if they just didn’t have time to worry about the math/time involved.
---
Assuming you are not tanking...
---
Keep battleshout up. 
---
Just apply rend if the rend will last the entire duration. 
---
Overpower when available. 
---
Cleave if two targets. 
---
Heroic strike.
---
Warrior dps is pretty fucking meh till +40
---
Lord roccor can also be soloed pretty easily. Used to do that in vanilla days as a feral druid in solely blue gear.
---
Sad that's it's alliance only. Oh well.
---
You think you get to attack as a ret paladin? Get back to handing out blessings and regenerating mana to do it again in 5 minutes.
---
Do you think that would be enough to properly stagger players? I don’t think 1-5 would be enough time to spread out a large population. I feel like 1-10 would be a bit better and 1-20 would be ideal. We’d want to find a range where most players naturally start to separate from each other. I think after level 20 the population will be spread out enough to the point where layering isn’t really even necessary. I’d want layering to be removed before we start seeing the other faction while leveling. 
---
With that said, I think that the length of time that layering is in the game matters a lot more than restricting it to certain level ranges. Ideally I’d like to see it in the game for one week. That way even the best speed levelers wouldn’t really be able to take advantage of the layering system for very long. If someone wants to rush to 60 and game the system for a couple of days, so be it.
---
Is this a British vs American humour thing? Am British, to me the original video was almost painfully sarcastic.
---
thanks for the link
---
Rend is not bad if it lasts the entire duration. 
---
It’s damage per rage spent is favorable. 
---
If it loses even one single tick though it’s pretty garbage.
---
How about layers ends at level 15. Layering is only active the first week or two after launch.
---
They said a few weeks into release in multiple interviews, and in others they said before phase 2, so we just have to wait and see, but of course, this subreddit loves act as if the worst possible scenario is already reality and definitive.
---
That's true, in the situation you have described the 4k server will have the same supply:demand ratio as the 2k server. However the reason that ratio is the same is because of layering. If it wasn't for layering, the 4k server would have the same level of supply as the 2k server.
---
ok thanks, pretty much what I've been doing
---
Natural selection. If she can’t handle a little ganking then she needs to go back to war mode.
---
Not necessarily. The server population size for beta could be 100, with 1,000 players on the Beta realm. This would mean 10 layers. Blizzard can just downscale #s to test the technology.
---
yeah they changed the way sharding works and have a new word for the new version
---
Nice! I made sure it fit pretty good for most phones.
---
im not talking about cold snap, i wouldnt include world boss drops in a bis list. but there are better wands in bwl and aq for frost and fire
---
1) wait for wotlk
---
2) do the easy as fuck horde version for the ravasaur mount

yeah if you think this clip equates to "destroyed servers" then classic is probably DOA for you. ggs. Hope you find what you're looking for somewhere else
---
Perhaps investing in servers that aren’t utter garbage might be worthwhile. If I wanted to play phase roulette I would play BFA
---
I remember farming winterspring ghosts / specters (I don't remember the name) on the frozen lake. I grinded from 51 to 60 on the same spot.
---
I will not do it, but it is possible to grind your way to 60 while doing those quests? Is it XP rewarding?
---
Nah, but I was debating between making my troll rogue green for STV ganking, or blue for Winterspring ganking. Give the alliance something to do ;)
---
Are you following me? I feel special. I must have hit a nerve. I wonder if you are that guy that got banned? Is this your alt account? Every reply in the past few minutes is directed at me and no activity for 17 hours before that.
---
&gt; They will server merge. Which they will need to do anyway.
---
The biggest reason they are doing sharding to begin with is to avoid mergers. I don't think you even understand what you are talking about. Mergers kill realms. Names get taken over, what about duplicate guild names? It's a shitshow and always was. Server cost is such a meaningless thing I don't understand why people with no tech knowledge try to use it.
---
They didn't even need to do that many mergers back in the old days because the population was ever increasing. Classic will be the opposite and the population will be ever decreasing after the launch weeks. Having to merge few realms versus having to merge like 80% of your realms can't be even compared.
---
I'll take 'What is a foster home?' for 100 gold, please.
---
Yeah, that's why I recommend that you remember you don't have to quest together. It's pretty rare that there are not enough mobs to support 2 grinders in an entire zone, and like I have said elsewhere: the best way to not fight with a guy of your level, in your zone, over mobs, is to group with him and coordinate so you are not in the same place at the same time.

I really don't know what you're trying to argue with me for, he says guilds will make waits to do group content not exist, I say unless you are a tank or healer it won't matter. You come here and start arguing about something else entirely.

I really don't see why the new models and textures can't be in Classic.

Shared name db within battlegroups
---
If you perceive what I wrote as aggressive then God help you ever deal with a bit of jocular banter in person. Your assumption is also incorrect, I'm afraid; where has it been stated that sharing or layering will be continent-wide? As far as I'm aware, there hasn't been such a statement. It seems as though your initial comment was a prime examples of people's wild speculation run rampant... and as for your reply... did you even think about why I might have wrote what I did? That was a rhetorical question by the way, just in case you missed that too.

Edit: punctuation.

Exactly! What class is this for though because depending on class Pure thought isn't better and sometimes you don't get enough to drop.

&gt;If it wasn't for layering, the 4k server would have the same level of supply as the 2k server.
---
Sure, but that's meaningless. Layers hold the population of original vanilla servers. That's why I went with 2k for a server or 4k divided across 2 layers, because 2k is about where an original vanilla server with a healthy population was at.
---
lmao

Leveled a shaman last month, 20 =&gt; 110 took 40h with +65% xp, and 110 =&gt; 120 took 10h on my main so at least 45h for a toon with all the tricks available.
---
Leveling was somewhat reworked in 7.3 with scaling across the whole world and mob HP/damages balance.
---
I like to level alts and do battlegrounds (don't like arena). If I do M+ it's with my guild. Almost anyone I see I will never see again because of phasing or because of cross server BGs. 
---
I used to know who the top guilds were, I knew where the farmers were and knew their names because I'd run into them in common farm spots. I knew who the people farming rep were cause I'd see them in the same areas as me. It built a sense of community being like "Oh cool, XYZ is here too". We would message each other if we got ranked to give a heads up, and if it got out of hand we would group up and take people down.
---
Phasing and cross realm stuff has ruined the immersion and sense of community. Even battlegroups were better than this

This should always be at the top until we get an official statement
---
You can duplicate items through layer hopping, a rogue just got double arena Grand Master by doing it.
---
From a progression standpoint, I would think a good portion of the community is going to be progressing at the same pace, so even if you disabled it outside of starting zones you need time for the community to spread out across progression zones otherwise the traffic of players will just travel together as they level up and would not be any different than the starting zones.

---
I keep flip flopping between priest and warlock.
---
In retail I was a priest from vanilla all the way to BFA, I played almost every exp (skipped wod and most of cata), probably played wrath the most outside of vanilla.  My friend is likely going to play mage again, and I dont want to doubledip on that.  Some of my thoughts:
---
Priest -  pros
---
* I know the class
---
* I (generally) prefer healing in 5mans, raids and premade PVP.
---
* for wpvp or solo I would like to play shadow, and I remember it being strong for small scale.  I would also heal in solo queue if I felt like it.
---
* Generally have always enjoyed the class
---
* Probably will be a big need for a strong healer class in groups
---
* aoe grinding with a friend will maybe be more viable with me around as a healer
---
Priest -  cons
---
* Shadow scales badly throughout vanilla.
---
* Compounding that, gearing for shadow will be next to impossible, with dps gear going to mage/warlocks in raids.
---
* on top of that, spending 100g or more per week to switch specs is going to be annoying, and something I will probably resent having to spend time farming for (unless i heal in shadow spec and dont tell anyone)
---
Warlock- pros
---
* It's something new.  Ive never played a warlock.
---
* strong class for pvp and pve, though for the latter it seems it only scales later on in the expansion.
---
* some pve and pvp specs seem to be the same, reducing the need for respecc.
---
* with pets, Ill have an easier time solo farming some content.
---
* still relatively needed in groups, because of summon and curse utility (and other stuff I maybe dont remember)
---
* itemization is more efficient, I will be able to use my raid gear for pvp
---
Warlock- cons
---
* 1-button rotation in groups/raids is Zzzzz, I don't know how long I will be interested in playing warlock at this level before I install an AHK script to spam 1 for me.
---
* in group pvp, and especially because I will be on horde, my dots and curses are liable to be constantly dispelled.
---
* scales well only later in the expansion
---
* if I assume the most common healer is a priest, and since I plan to play with my friend, I'm looking at 3 cloth users every time I run a 5man, which is going to be annoying all the way to 60.
---
* soul shards (though this probably wont be as big an issue as I am thinking it will be)
---
Other- pros/cons
---
* No idea, sometimes I think I should go with something completely different, but I tend to not enjoy melee classes so that reduces my options.  I do sometimes enjoy tanking, but I think guilds are going to have their established tanks and finding a spot is probably going to be way more difficult as a casual raider.  
---
I'm not sure if I really missed anything, I am probably going to flipflop a million times before august, but I think it helps a bit to lay down what im thinking.
---
What do you guys think I would prefer based on what I've outlined?  I think I'm getting stuck with analysis paralysis.
---
That journey to Razflux Den looks even more long and treacherous than trying to travel down from northern Stranglethorn to Booty Bay as a level 33.
---
This guy doesn't know shaman, he just knows orc is strong.
---
Stun resist very strong against rogue, and to a lesser extent warriors and paladins. The thing is shaman already are very strong against rogues if you have a shield equiped and full mail which you would be assuming pvp.
---
Tauren is far and away the better pvp choice if ele or resto it's not even close. It enables stomp guaranteed lesser healing wave. It enables stomp guaranteed chain lightning. It enables earth shock stomp earthshock to lock out a school of you target for over 10 seconds. That's not even mentioning the power of stunning 3ish ppl at once for 2 seconds and it's a short cd.
---
The rogue matchup is easy due to nature's swiftness which the main ele spec has, poison cleansing totem, and your very high armor, and your trinket breaks stuns. Shaman are one of the best classes against rogues even without being an orc.
---
to be honest, the addition of Arenas to the game DID make the game less enjoyable for me, so, for players that feel the same way that I feel, arenas ARE bad. And I repeat, I don't want arenas because the best PvP gear is tied to that, not because arenas are a bad addition to the game.
---
The same way there are people that enjoy transmog, lfr, etc, there is nothing purely bad or good, its a player to player basis
---
After seeing all of these layering bugs i really hope this is just a temporary system at launch, i have a feeling this is going to hurt the experience. If official vanilla and private servers could run without layering i dont see why they are trying so hard to add this. As someone who played vanilla for years i really dont want layering added, even if it means fighting others for quest mobs for months.
---
I would say it's the coolest mount in vanilla. The ZG one is awesome also, but it depends only on luck.
---
I would like the better graphics, but not the effects. Every fight looks like a clusterfuck and I hate it. You can't see what anyone is doing.
---
How is it meaningless?
---
My argument has only ever been that layering results in an increase in supply, and we've just demonstrated that to be true.
---
Not going to bother with these comments because anyone trying to claim her original model was better is just blindly hating because BFA bad.
---
Would be awesome for those of us who have forums blocked at work
---
Additional layers are only supposed to be spun up after the population hits 3k (then 6k, etc.). I haven't done a census but I really doubt the beta has been getting anywhere close to 3k concurrent players. If it was 100 players it'd just be sharding (which seems to be happening right now). 
---
I genuinely think this is a bug with the last update because as a beta player I haven't encountered layering at all up until this point, which is how it's supposed to work. The stresstest has been used to test layering so I doubt this is intentional.
---
I mean, I can understand not wanting to, but there are things like Flameweave Cuffs of Frozen Wrath included. BiS Lists imply the absolute best of the best, then more feasible options listed after the fact. Like I’d love a Lunar Wand of Frozen Wrath with 13 FSP, but I’m cool with the Stylus because BoE rolls are out of my control. I still like to know what the 100% best option is though.
---
I see you haven't been very intimate with the last 5 years of Blizz betas.  What you see is what you get.
---
Nah, they're already doubling down in this thread with "it's just beta" or "it's still not a big deal, I don't have any friends to layer hop with anyway"
---
See you in a month past launch when raid groups can't see each other in Blackrock Mountain and they'll still be defending it.
---
I'm not trying to prove any point lol, you clearly took something way out of proportion, I don't know what kind of e-boner you got for defense rating in vanilla, my entire post was laughing at the fact that guilds think they're going to clear the first two raids within 10 days of classic release which obviously went right over your head. lol you clearly have some issues.
---
I did it back in the day but I do not even remember it taking so long. I just know it was a relaxing activity for me to do to go there, listen to music and just farm minding my own business. 
---
Despite it being many years ago I have memories of the last 1% of the grind though, being so close I was even anxious and wanted to finish sooooo much. Its an amazing mount. Best one in the game by far, only rivaled by "Amani war bear" released much later in another expansion.
---
this has been happening for weeks/months.  I am sure they know about it.
---
Loving the shit out of these pictures. Very cool.
---
I didn't remember that different races had different riding skills.. hub
---
Sweet! It goes live at 8 eastern Friday right?
---
 WOW kid you just got [r/WOOOOOOSHED](https://www.reddit.com/r/WOOOOOOSHED/)!!!! 😂😂👀
---
In conclusion, I am posting this to the community known as "[r/Wooooosh](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wooooosh/)" to claim my internet points in your embarrassment 😏. Imbecile. The Germans refer to this action as "Schadenfreude," which means "harm-joy" 😬😲. WOW! 🤪 Another reference I had to explain to you. 🤦‍♂️🤭 I am going to cease this conversation for I do not converse with simple minded persons.😏😂
---
I stopped playing the game early wrath.
---
There is a weekly thread for this question.
---
Good thing she doesn't deserve it i guess......
---
that's pretty cool
---
This wouldn't happen in retail because nobody needs to talk to each other while questing, sharding, and LFD
---
No iPhone app?
---
I plan on working on my side business while grinding lol. Get two birds stoned at once.
---
Easier than making whole new zones you can fly over?
---
No layers would make the game unplayable on launch. The population for the 1st month of classic is going to be at least double what it ends up settling to later on. Which means you need layering to manage it. The only other solution would be to add more servers, but then when the pop declines you will have dead realms.
---
Yeah, that's what I thought. Don't worry, when you grow up you'll learn how to handle being called out on being wrong.
---
SI:7 concealed infos
---
Blizzard doesn't really care about testing. THIS IS NOT A BETA TEST.
---
If there are any patches in the future, I hope it’s purely opening new zones like this for exploration and quest rewards and not other-worldly stuff, flying, or really anything off-script of what vanilla was.  I didn’t hate BC, it was my favorite expansion actually, but I’d want a much more grounded approach to future content instead of wild adventures in the cosmos.
---
I don't understand why this isn't the obvious solution.  It resolves the same launch problem with minimal negative affects.
---
Kinda glad I'm horde haha
---
Horde player here. Convince me it doesn't look just like the regular night elf tiger mounts.
---
Deep down I think I'm just jelly.
---
You are completely overestimating the amount of active players if you think there wouldn't be a need for mergers until 9 months away with small realms. With sharding 1 single realm can hold 10+ realms population at start, and if it stays highly populated it's easy to give free transfers to lower population one. When you have 10 realms and only a few of them stay active then suddenly you have multiple ghost towns and trying to merge them causes a shitshow. People always flock to certain realms, be it after certain players, guilds, nationalities and so on. If you have fewer realms all of them will be realms that people flock to.
---
Layering isn't going anywhere.
---
Took me 40h to 20=&gt; 110 with +65% xp and all the tricks in the book (full enchants, pots, flying at max speed, legion crafted legendaries and so on). Add another 5 to 10h to reach max level.
---
It shouldn't be that far from 120h for a new player who may take time for profession, discoveries, AH and so on.
---
It’s more about density at the starting areas, that’s a fact.
---
Edit: this is why dynamic spawns were originally part of the argument as well
---
Is LH actually using the values from classicdb?
---
Its specific to your account, there isn't a generic survey that anyone can fill in
---
My computer blocks the site.
---
Personally I prefer the one from Cata/Mop.
---
I agree. Let's get the rank 11 mount and that's good to go hahaha
---
Heros of the storm blue armored blood elf sylvanas
---
I did it in TBC, I doubt I do it in Vanilla. I'd rather use my time to do something more useful.
---
Ah that makes sense, thanks.
---
Probably lots of different numbers to see what the majority will put up with
---
Holy shit! this is fantastic! I love it! Good job! I will be using this site A LOT! thank you thank you thank you for this!
---
Its just for launch/phase 1. I wouldn’t worry about it
---
Yeah I’ve never once gotten that right click to unlearn to work in mobile for any of these talent calculators
---
The 50-60 zones are very hit and miss. You run out of quests before you hit 60. I remember just farming mobs in Wintersprings near the end.
---
Desolace is also pretty tedious. Zone is huge and you don't have mounts yet. Quests are super slow.
---
The more people talk about this beta the more I think we'll be back on private servers within a few weeks of launch.
---
Yeah I know they said that and it’s good! I just can’t help but think of the hardcore players (not me), they can abuse this for probably a good 3 months because they’ll be 60 in a week
---
&gt; The amazing thing is how many people actually fell for it. 
---
What's amazing is how many are _still_ falling for it.
---
Kargoz has done some videos on duo leveling, and I am pretty sure he intends to do more, as he almost always duo levels on his stream. He's pretty into it, so I'd check out his stuff. Most of his videos are pre-beta though, so they might not be 100% accurate to Classic. Still interesting stuff to watch. Like I said, I am almost certain he intends to update the guides with true Classic numbers.
---
Would it not suffice to have a hierarchical sharding system in that case? E.g. if there are 8 shards for starting zones, 4 shards for 20-35, 2 shards for 35-50, and 1 shard for 50-60, then have each shard consist of a merge of the shards in the previous level divide. This way, if I was in a shard with someone at level 1 then I will stick with them to lvl 60; I simply get more potential people in my shard in later level zones but don't lose any.
---
This is something that first happened for me after the patch yesterday.
---
Yup. I really dont understand the fun in not being able to play. I honestly think people who say this have never gone through it OR just dont care much about the game. It's not funny or unique or special. Its " oh I cant play this I'll play later cause this is literally unplayable". That's a great way for a game to start just ask WoD!
---
Not really all that funny from experience. It really sucks tbh.
---
You can get 2 per 3 hours instead of 1. Which is the same number of trinkets per server as each layer is a servers worth of players . I totally agree it needs fixing, but resources being doubled, when there are double the number of players is 0 net gain. This can be achieved easier on a single server rather than layers
---
Stop talking out of your ass. It doesn't make you sound smart.
---
How about this idea. And I know it's fucking crazy. Instead of making a new layer or shard. They release another server. Now hear me out. I know this is crazy talk. But when one server is full, perhaps they could release another server, sure everyone would be forced into the same world. But that's the cost we pay.
---
Oh? Can you link it?
---
I'd rather have the full vanilla experience of dealing with a horde of people than this bullshit immersion-breaking exploitable carry-over from retail called layering. #nochanges
---
I got Raptor in ZG at 60 and that's still my favorite mount to this day. 
---
I only ever saw DeathCharger once and that was in BC or wrath when they changed mount drops to be 1% and I passed on it so my Best Friend could have it.
---
I have no boner for defense in vanilla (not rating, that came with TBC).
---
Guids are going to clear MC/Ony within a day of filling a roster with 40 attuned warm bodies. If they can achieve that within 10days of classic release it's another matter, but you don't really need any special gear to clear MC/Ony. Just funnel all the thorium and dark iron to the tank and you'r gucci.
---
That would be more authentic than all these issues with layering. :P
---
I 100% agree with you. It's like everyone here is forgetting this will only be temporary. Now, if it was permanent, then I could see where they are coming from, but I don't want to spawn camp NPCs just to finish quests, or sit in hour long queues just to get into the game.
---
Surely this must be temporary testing of their layering capabilities? Venruki using layering for the arena chest was absolutely insane. I'm sure they are just seeing what it's capable of.
---
I agree with many in this thread - layering will help a tonne with lower end content, so perhaps enable layering till phase 2 for 1-20.
---
I don't know what you're talking about. Old AV was fun to join mass pvp. You could hop in for a few hours and always have huge pvp fights. It wasn't about honor grinding. If you wanted to do that WSG &amp; AB were your go-to. I don't know how anyone can say they prefer the newer AV. All you do is mount up and run to opposing faction leader with little interference. How is that better pvp than the old version?
---
Great idea, good luck mate.
---
When you have MCP bear tanks generate way more threat than warriors - their threat is multiplicative in nature, not additive like warriors. Survivability, poor itemization, and lack of major defensive CDs are where they struggle.
---
I wish there was at least a switch option that would let us turn new graphics on and off. that would make everyone happy.
---
nvm, found it.
---
No one dies inside a deathcoil unless they were already about to die. Mages and locks compete for gear, and mages were hugely popular.
---
Layering is literally just a continent-wide shard. CRZ is cross realm zoning, and was never planned for classic nor do you need it to use sharding, so I'm not sure why you're bringing that up.
---
Reported for reporting /s
---
Yeah. like how to farm.
---
This Comment perfectly encapsulates why a ton of people avoid his stream........

---
Did it once and swore to never never NEVER do it again!
---
I might do it again...
---
&gt; Call them out on it IF it happens, not when the servers haven't even been released.
---
Thats crazy, Humans always try and solve problems before they arise so they wont have to deal with those problems.
---
Battlegroups never did that before. Why would you need them to do it now? And why restrict names like that? Seems like you're setting fire to the forest in order to kill one spider.
---
Retail is terrible for so many reasons, don't be obtuse.  Most original players will not be able to invest as much time in Classic as they did in Vanilla.  Most Vanilla players coming back to Classic were likely pretty hardcore about playing back then, but priorities change for most people as they get older.  It's not unreasonable for Blizzard to include this question in their survey, and it's not unreasonable for fans of Vanilla to entertain the Character Boost option.
---
Having the time to level multiple characters to 60 is not necessarily a sign for love of the game or skill.  It just means you have more time to play.  And honestly, some people level up and have fun doing that, but most veteran players just try to get to 60 as fast as possible.
---
EDIT:  If you can level through playing Battlegrounds, I would def opt for that.  Questing to level is boring after the nth time.
---
This system should only be in the starting zones and only for a few weeks, if theres anyway blizzard can ruin the feel of classic its with layering / sharding..
---
Based on what looks to be hundreds of downvoted you’ve received between you’re various comments in this thread, I’m just going to walk away from this discussion now.  Clearly the vast majority of people disagree with you, and this has exactly zero chance of ever happening (thank god).  Not going to waste anymore time on it.
---
Yeah and they are not a competition due to being much worse at the game, and not contest multiple layers.
---
Whatever is happening on the beta server is broken, I think people are freaking out over a bug. If we assume that layering is going to work as the devs described, no one on the beta server should ever experience layering because the population is not high enough to even spawn a second layer. This all seems to have started after the last update.
---
Again, an increase in supply doesn't mean anything if there's a corresponding increase in demand. There's no effective change.
---
I feal your pain mate. But who needs to sleep more then 2H a day.
---
Where did you read that?
---
From what I heard, the devs just didn't know what they were doing when they were building the zones and were just loosely following a map by Metzen so they ended up with a lot of areas too big or too small.
---
Depends what version of AV they are testing. If it's the newer one gear doesn't matter since you just run past everyone to faction leaders...
---
1.13 seems practical
---
Being limited for 1-5 level  is still pretty stupid idea - it will still get bottlenecked right after that. The maps arent made for so many people and there  are mobs for like 3-4 people to quest at the same area without too much hassle and we will be getting many times those numbers even with layering. Unless we keep layers until like level 20 or 30 it will still be a shitshow
---
Four hour queue means I'd get maybe an hour to play before I need to go to bed.  Ten hour queue means I might get to play if I start the process in the morning.  Both scenarios assume the queue time remains constant so I don't get in early and disconnect due to inactivity or give up for the day because it goes a bit longer.
---
&gt; I guess you getting to log in and play day 1 for 2 hours is more important than healthly servers though. 
---
I mean, it's really only your, and a few other angry neckbeards', opinion that layered servers are fundamentally "unhealthy."  And yeah, I'd much rather get to play the game, at the cost of you having to deal with the absolute horror of making new friends in game because your IRL friends are such drama queens they're cancelling their plans to play over this.
---
&gt; Enjoy! For all of the 2 weeks you play.
---
Nice gatekeeping there, champ.  You don't know anything about me or how long I'll play, but sure, just go on believing everyone who has a different opinion than you is just a tourist.
---
It’s also fun to stick a shield spike on your shield.  Works better with Prot Pally, but still fun with Warrior.
---
Personally I think this is how the expansions should've gone. Open up previously-locked zones in Azeroth and make small, faction-level changes to other zones to keep the quest zones a bit more dynamic. Bonus points if the zones aren't all end-game, too.
---
Hindsight is 20/20, of course.
---
That's the thing about all these "alternate time-line" posts - everyone agrees that there are things to like about Classic. Nobody can really agree on what made Classic special (at most, vague ethereal concepts like "community" - but what exactly breeds community, what content do we keep or build upon that breeds community and what doesn't?) or what direction classic should go.
---
Most beta testers probably won't even play it after day 1. If Blizzard doesn't get enough info they can add more testers and extend it.
---
this and the argent dawn tabard (one day)
---
Does horde have an equivalent in ungoro? I did alliance and timber maw. Now I'm classic it's time to horde
---
Oh god I wont go back there, Just have to write wow off as a whole. OSRS is doing some great things at least.
---
I don’t remember layering on wotlk or tbc launch and those launches were fine. Annoying but not unplayable. How did this unplayable meme start
---
I mean execute damage is static so any warrior could do this.
---
It's not "insane" to see a 100 rage execute hit for this on leather.
---
They are just as good honestly, wotf = stoneform,
---
Hardiness is straight broken though, if rng is in your favour
---
The fear immunity trinket is insanely good for PvP
---
Personally I will get engineering/mining, and then swap out mining for blacksmithing at 60 and when I get enough materials to complete the quest.
---
I thought NE dropped their head.
---
I enjoy Fury Warrior and Frost Mage on retail. I somewhat enjoy tanking, but I prefer DPS. I enjoy melee dps the most, though I do enjoy ranged. I plan on mostly using my main for raiding in classic. Which class and build should I go with?
---
Same.
---
Why is this downvoted so much lmao
---
I played retail vanilla and I been raiding vanilla for the past 3 years.
---
The game will be much different.  The player base in retail vanilla was clueless.
---
The racing gnomes and goblins were cool though. It definitely felt like Death Valley.
---
I forgot another point: No debuff limit. (This allows every class to actually use their toolkit)
---
For me this is the way forward after we run out of vanilla content. Unlock new zones and new content in the classic world.
---
The irony of your comment is hilarious.  If you had a shred of self awareness you wouldn't have said anything.
---
It's standard server virtualization/dockers. Office 365 is SaaS, Wow is not.
---
100% yes.
---
They do experiments and surveys like this all the time to maximize profit. It's why every Hearthstone expansion has a different price point and they offer less and less while charging whatever the hell they want.
---
Did you ever play during the release of Vanilla or TBC?
---
Before WOTLK, Blizzard had very poor launches. Players were funneled into the same areas. A zone with 40 people feels occupied, a zone with 140 people feels unplayable.
---
Layering sounds stupid and worrying, but the trade-off would be worse. At least, for most players. The people who are able to sit in-front of their PC for 70-hours a week would probably be better off without layering.
---
It's like talking to a wall, I give up on you good sir.
---
Sharding first areas for a few weeks was exactly what they originally planned, and it was an excellent solution.
---
Of course, people complained without understanding it, and now we ended up with something much worse. People defend it because at least it isn't _called_ sharding. Brilliant move by everyone involved.
---
A repeatable quest that you could do multiple times a day. I think daily means 1x per day
---
do you realise that one hardware server != one wow server? a modern state of the art server (which doesnt even cost that much 5k maybe) can easly handle 10k connections. they just split it into virtual instances. layering has no/neglectable impact on the used Hardware and Hardware costs.
---
unless they recycle there 15year old server racks they found in there basement that is just some stupid myth someone started and you people keep repeating
---
"Because they get it for free" is so, so true, but don't forget that it's easily accessible, too, and I think that is possibly an even bigger reason. Private servers meant finding them (not hard, but it's a step), doing research to find a "good" one, and then downloading a client from a source that you may or may not trust. Classic is leagues ahead of that in accessibility. Cost is debatable (still gotta pay the 15/mo for Classic access) but accessibility is not. Nost population probably went up due to word of mouth, which makes sense for the niche 'market' it's in; Classic isn't in the same league by any stretch of the imagination. Sure, some people will hear from an old friend about it, but most people popping in to check it out already play and pay attention to Blizzard news. It makes it almost a guarantee that the population will not continue to rise for months and months after launch, but will instead decrease—maybe not exponentially, but it's hard not to predict a downward trend.
---
TL;DR: I agree that most people who pop in to just check the game out will give up when/if they find questing difficult or impossible, and that's part of it. I'm fairly certain half of them will give Classic a fair chance, but overall population will decline after the hype of the first month or so.
---
Here is a question fot you. Why simply not implement it as it was not in the original version of the game? 
---
A lot of people are against it and for valid reasons,  the way i see it only the ones who would like to abuse it are for it. Also take into consideration all the feedback that was available for BFA and what good that did.
---
There is nothing that will improve your life more than doing what you want
---
Following you? No. It is true that I didn't comment on Reddit yesterday evening or while I was sleeping and then I logged in and the only thing that made me want to comment is when I saw someone accusing people having a poor grasp of the English language while being the poster-child of the Dunning-Kruger effect. Then I thought, maybe it's just this subject, maybe he's generally a decent person who is having a bad day. So I read a few of your comments and almost immediately saw that you told someone he was making an oxymoron out of himself.

---
Bump
---
Ok.
---
Pretty sure that Hide of the Wild -&gt; Shroud of Pure Thought -&gt; Cloak of Clarity is the BIS progression for every healer in the game. Naxx changes things up due to spirit starting to outweigh the MP5 stat.
---
From what I remember in vanilla - every healing class gained the same benefit from the MP5 stat, where priests and druids gained similar effects from spirit. This is why Cloak of Suturing pulls ahead of Cloak of Clarity for Priest/Druid but cloak of clarity remains the top cloak for Pally/Shaman healers. 
---
It's been a long time though, I could be wrong.
---
So far the only good thing about Classic is that it will allow for more accurate private servers.
---
&gt;It takes no longer than 10-13 hours AT MOST without heirloom gear, and someone rushing can get it done in 5-7. Quit spouting nonsense.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
You are the one spouting nonsense... The current record speed run for 1-120 with anything allowed (heirlooms, exp potions, etc.) is [22 hours 45 minutes](https://www.speedrun.com/wow#Level_1_to_120).
---
I’ve used 12+ button razers since Cata (Currently using Trinity for no reason except 12 button), and while I love razer, they all break. They last a year or 2, just be ready for things to stop working. Right click, left click, certain buttons... gets annoying. Still a quality mouse aside from their purposeful quick obsoletion -.-
---
It happened to me a lot during the stress test. Maybe I am wrong and it never happened before on beta. Not sure,
---
This of course will depend on the person, but I wanted to blow my brains out about halfway thru this grind and just gave up. It takes an eternity and is super boring. The best part was the occasional world pvp encounters but in that area of winterspring I didn't see it that often.
---
You've never played with a laggy congested server. It's not hard in  a "with time I'll get better and overcome this" way. It's going to be " I literally cant move, I'm clicking all my buttons and nothing is happening, things are rubber banding, sounds are glitching. Let me spam my hearthstone and hope that goes off. Nope, cause it's a new game and everyone has the same hearth. Guess I'll log out, but wait cant do that even so ill have to alt-f4."
---
Then you're not even able to get back on because everyones doing the same so theres a huge queue. 
---
I dont see how not playing the game is a wonderful experience.
---
&gt; where has it been stated that sharing or layering will be continent-wide?
---
If you are literally asking that you needed my initial comment so the rest of this discussion has been pointless.  Layering is the whole continent, that's what it is.  That's the whole reason they made layering and called it something different than sharding so it would be the whole continent.
---
I see now I misinterpreted your stupidity for aggression.
---
I mean true, my point was not to go to extremes of convenience. Just pointing out that some things are just plain and simple inconveniences, and striving for inconveniences for inconveniences sake is also doomed. Just seems that some people have a need to add inconveniences just because "well that's what classic was all about"...and it's not. You want balance and a way to conquer the inconveniences by doing *meaningful* work that you're in control of. 
---
The thing with inconveniences in classic are that they have a reason and (often) a reward behind them. 
---
Like not having a mount at lvl 20, it forces you to play different and explore the world in a way that you wouldn't with a mount, and when you get the mount it's a satisfying feeling because you get minimize the amount of inconveniences you had. 
---
A launch filled filled with people where noone can get anything done doesn't serve a purpose in a game. It is out of your control, which just feels shitty and makes you feel hopeless. It's just an inconveniences! That may even deter people from giving the game a chance.
---
That's a decent point. But I would say you heavily overestimate the amount of decline the game will go through. I have just never known an MMO, even failure MMOs with the kind of drop off you are speculating. Hell SWTOR put off mergers for a long ass time when the servers were basically empty and with everything we have seen in the past with how mergers went down in wow, how can you honestly think they will die in mere weeks? Most people won't even be 60 yet.
---
With mergers aside what's left of your point? That there can be 10 times more people on a server? How does that help us the player? I don't see the positive here. Having a single server for more immersion just makes more sense to me.
---
Do you actually think you're fooling anyone but yourself? At this point that's even sadder than your lack of understanding of layering.
---
Yeah this is pretty fuckin cool. I’m all about no changes but if they do it correctly it could be cool.
---
meh didn't think about it
---
For people considering it: this grind takes about 200-250 hours to complete.
---
So roughly \~3 hours per day for \~3 months.
---
Not necessarily. Does move where the bottleneck is but the amount squeezing through that bottleneck is different depending on where its placed. Not everyone levels at the same pace after all
---
the other problem is that layering doesnt care about factions, it doesnt try to balance the number of horde and alliance per layer.
---
we saw this in one of the stress tests.  both sides tried to make armies of level characters to fight it out, but outside of a few stragglers, ally's and horde couldnt see eachother because of layering
---
&gt;has there ever been a huge drop off WEEKS into a new release?
---
Wod, which is considered the worst expansion started with 10 million players and lost 3 millions in first quarter, so just 3 months. And had lost half of the playerbase, 5 millions in 2 quarters, so just 6 months. Classic isn't also new release. It's old and there will be tons of people that are not going to keep playing and just want to have a trip down memory lane.
---
&gt;Have they needed merges weeks after release? No. 
---
Have they released vanilla/old expansions again? No.
---
This was Blizzard's plan all along. Make Layering suck so much the players beg for Sharding.
---
It doesn't matter why you pay for your sub! Paying for a sub gives you the right to use retail servers and only retail servers! It does not entitle you to anything more.
---
You can twist it all you want, but it won't make a difference. As a dev you should beware that Blizzard has been running a lot of betas before and knows what they are looking for. If they think the data they are gathering is good enough, then that is the end of the argument. You can theory craft all you want, but is Blizzard the one who got the raw data and can make the best decision based of that. If they find out they need more testers, they will invite more people.
---
Also, that is not how a bonus works. If you get X because you bought Y, you still didn't pay for X and you are not entitled to receive X unless stated otherwise on purchase. Blizzard have never said you would be guaranteed an invite.
---
I'm rolling a NE anyway (if I go Alliance at least) so no...Its not distinctive enough from the mounts they get otherwise.  I think the Zulian Tiger, the Black PvP Nightsaber, and the Swift Stormsaber are the best looking cats in Classic anyway.
---
Games were designed with a different philosophy back then. There's things in the game that are meant to be long term goals for only the most dedicated. The payoff is that you're the only one with the mount, and it's actually special to you and people are hyped just to see you riding around on it. Not like today where you get awarded a new mount every day just for logging in.
---
I think they traded agency for availability. You could farm mobs for days and get 5 rep per mob. You can do it for hours and reach your goal at some point, but not everyone will spend their time doing it.
---
Meanwhile BFA offers you a daily emissary worth ~1800 rep every day. How many mobs would you have grinded anyway ? At 5 rep per mob that's 360 mobs worth of rep per emissary. And it took you what ? 15 to 25 min.
---
You're really efficient nowaday, but what you farm isn't really up to you anymore, and i think that's the issue.
---
You’re really out of the loop huh?
---
24/7
---
The Venomhide Ravasaur is in Un'Goro but I'm not sure it's just horde because I played alliance back then and I have it but it could have been on my belf rogue.. someone please clarify
---
Yup that original experience of hopping layer to layer for the first 6 months to farm out your professions and rare mobs. Enjoy that real classic experience. 
---
&gt;Fuck you people and your ignorance thinking that anyone who thinks differently is bad.
---
Is this ironic? Or what?
---
He said small changes though. Tweaking where a quest reward is at or adjusting how many of X you have to collect is a small change. Cata completely removed/replaced quest lines and fundamentally changed the overall landscape (see the Barrens, 1k needles, etc). 
---
Im for adjustments, not replacing things altogether.
---
and still had a 10k queue
---
With RPers desire to enforce arbitrary rules on other players, you'd think they'd be good at [following them](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/search?q=flair%3ALFG%2BMonday&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all).
---
Yeah, I think we would've been served better with several smaller cataclysm-like expansions instead of constantly shipping off to a new world / continent.
---
That makes it impossible to play with friends or form a guild.
---
Well, if you’re a Rogue, you’re in luck:
---
https://shadowpanther.net/pvp.htm
---
That isn't evidence that it doesn't care about factions, that's only evidence that those groups were on different layers.
---
alot of the streamer i watch dont even wont to do the av test, they just want to keep leveling/playing their lvl 40 char, so they maybe try one av and stop after
---
i expect av queues to be dead after the first day of tests if no new people get invited
---
This is legit how I thought it was supposed to be.  Seeing how this has been working in Beta, I can't tell the difference between "shards" and "layers" other than at some point they're going to just stop doing it.  
---
I actually thought it'd be like Hellscream 1 is completely detached from Hellscream 2 until Blizz brings them together.  I guess the problem with this is that as soon as streamers say "we're rolling on Hellscream 1" then everyone follows and it defeats the purpose.  
---
I dunno, the only workaround I can see is if you just chose Hellscream and it auto-selected a sub-server for you, then if you wanted to play with friends, at char select you'd have to click a "join friends" button and if you are mutual friends, then your created character gets forced to their server.  Prevents stream snipers and allows friends to play together until the merger.  This would be horrible for pre-made guilds looking to roll together though.
---
Stress test may have been associated with a different issue. I noticed there was a lot of bleed over with the other servers during that time.
---
Whether or not the increase in supply "means" anything doesn't change the fact that it **is** an increase in supply, or the fact that the only reason it is happening is due to layering.
---
So 5k people all in the same starting area at the same time was original. Fuck yourself idiot. Dumb as a brick
---
As someone who has them. It honestly looks worse than the normal elf mount
---
Can we says it's her Legion version instead? :p
---
New one
---
I can provide more context to this. We've already gone through this layering cycle many, many, many times over. Most of the complaints about layering are straight up low effort posts that don't add anything new to the discussion. They are reposts. Additionally, posts about layering are flooded with reports from users from *this* community. It's safe to say that many people in this community are tired of seeing the same rehashed posts about layering.
---
Human has an advantage for sure but I still think it's going to take longer than that.
---
It's not about the physical servers required. Server merges have a huge impact on the economy and community of both servers.
---
Lol be back to un-official servers that have the potential to walk away tomorrow? Yeah no thanks. I'll play a shotgun spawn in a few areas version of the game before going back to an un-official, illegal server.
---
Even tho it’s “just” a saber, it’s very noticable even between the masses.
---
Your post was removed for not being related to Classic. Should be self-explanatory.
---
It takes about 3-4 times longer compared to quest and mob grinding in between quests.
---
You cannot say what "most people" will want, only what you want. The fact is that there's a lot of people who play wow who just want to log in, kill things, get gold and get purples. And they're going to be in for a hell of a surprise in classic.
---
Don't you understand?! They are saving money caused by mergers that they rarely do by creating this new tech that costs money to make!

And here we go again :D .. I've tried Ally on retail after playing only horde since I remember and I couldn't get the feeling at all... Boralus is cool no doubt, but playing an ally was so much against my believes.. sort of Athelstan praising Thor type of thing
---
I saw that but this is more a discussion about guild themes rather than recruitment? Like potential ideas that could be explored
---
I just don't want to talk to people or wear headsets outside of organized groups.
---
Pre-raid roger needs Barman Shanker as MH dagger! :))))
---
I understand what you are saying, but Blizzard can just tweak (for Beta purposes to test the technology) a server population to only 100, so it forces the Beta realm to spin off into layers. I am not saying they are doing this, but it seems like a possibility to force layering.
---
Layering was very apparent on the stress realms. Within 5 minutes, I was bouncing between layers while playing solo as well as while in a group (not immediately after invite, while we were questing as a group).
---
Yah, I think he's hinting at that.  And the Cataclysm zones were actually quite good (the ones that weren't destroyed).  I wasn't a fan of the linear progression in the zones, but the zones themselves were good.
---
It is a lot better than vent for everything.
---
I agree with you somewhat. But layering is not there to fix the problem you stated. There will be just as many people camping the starter zones as on a regular server because a new layer is not created until the realm hits max. Sharding would work how you state, layering would not as it is server wide. There will still be THOUSANDS of people in the starting zones with or without layering. People need to understand this.
---
Got a guild webbie / Post here someplace? I lothe PVP, but Dedicated raids with dedicated raiders in Vanilla seem like a much less intense commitment compared to BFA.
---
I think this is the worst grind in the entire game
---
Ok, so then the point you're trying to make is just meaningless. Supply levels alone don't mean anything, the only thing that matters is the supply in relation to the demand.
---
For warlock, I disagree with two of your selections for permanent BIS.
---
In my view, you don't want T3 shoulders, you want Rime Covered Mantle. You also don't want rockfury bracers, you want crit bracers from Gothik. In raids, crit is *marginally* more valuable than hit for warlocks because of the debuff applied by crits.
---
I like the first, not because of the model but the idea behind it. Thrall is “an orc, just like you”. If there’s any way to make the player feel ‘special’ it’s to make the ‘heroes’ the same shitty character models as your shitty character model.
---
Plus when you do that, you make the horde feel more ‘raggedy’ and really the horde shouldn’t be that special. They (and the alliance, too) are just a minuscule force compared to the old gods and the burning legion. They shouldn’t be “very special” imho. Thrall shouldn’t be “the chosen one” he’s just some fucking orc who’s a warlord over a bunch of freaks who banded together out of necessity.
---
Granted, someone might say “well sylvanas is just a nelf model” but why wouldn’t she be? She’s a blood elf turned banshee who broke free of her mind control. Night elf model fits close enough, and a lot of people got attached to the way she looked. I never questioned it, I knew sylvanas from Wc3.
---
Then why would you sign up for beta in the preferences?
---
It's a TBC thing
---
In classic you'll have to get to rank11 and then buy the mount with gold
---
Layering deals with tourism; a large influx of players at lower levels who are all just checking out the game and most likely quitting before even reaching level 20.
---
So while the realm may be 5x the population of a normal vanilla realm, they are all mostly low levels. The permanent (read: high level) population should be equivalent to a _single_ normal population realm, if the system works correctly anyway. But for them, there has been 5x high level resources even though there are only 1x high levels characters.
---
Uh, no... It's not like the alternative was ever going to be each realm having it's own hardware or something like that.
---
It's 2019, all of the server infrastructure is virtualized. The cost will be essentially the same whether they had 10 "servers" with 15 layers each, or 150 'flat' servers.
---
If anything, creating whatever tech they're going to use for layering would be the more expensive proposition.
---
Warriors are so rough, especially before you get intercept. Oh, I'm dotted and in combat... there is now nothing I can do.
---
FYI the minimum distance for a ranged attack is also affected, so the deadzone is still the same length, just further from your character model.
---
That wouldn't be false so sure
---
What region are you from? I'm from Belgium, so if you are from the US as I suspect, we probably won't have compatible time slots...
---
Because Wrath and TBC launches had well over 100 servers to spread the player base out. And there were still absolutely issues. HFP was a nightmare on TBC launch. Classic isn't going to have anywhere near that amount of servers, and there will probably be several million people playing for the 1st month or so.
---
If you make enough servers to have Classic launch be stable, then you will have dead/dying servers in 6 months when half the population quits.
---
&gt;The newly stood up servers are the layers that we are seeing.
---
The point I am making is that layering is an incomplete solution, and additional servers are a better solution to deal with non-surge population. Layering is bad for the long-term players.
---
&gt; generic clothing.
---
By all means, farm the Spiderfang Carapace and then get back to me about how generic it is.
---
Oh, and the gloves are a rare-drop crafted recipe too.
---
That'd be great, except [the post you removed](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c07dyq/-/) and these comments have nothing to do with Layering...
---
3 months is a ridiculously long time for a feature as damaging as Layering.
---
Most gear during leveling is from quest anyway I wouldn’t sweat it
---
Idiots react strongly to conditional statements and arguments with qualifiers - and scream about how they are “lies” because they’re more complicated than the instructions on the back of a microwaveable burrito.
---
What would really stop you from doing that anyway? You can still grab a group of people and try to level up in a unique way without being forced to do that. And if more people can then enjoy the game how they want to (i.e. just having a smooth leveling experience) what's the harm?
---
Yea, honestly... I was hesitantly pro layering/sharding at the beginning. But now I'm really worried for what WoW is going to look like if it can be exploited like this or even just cause the problems that people have been showcasing.
---
Same. I'll probably do the same this time around!
---
Ferals have two options for spell interruption, or three if you're horde - War Stomp, Bash (a 5 sec stun from bear), or Feral Charge (bear &amp; must be 8 yds away). Feral Charge will immobilize and can silence for 4 seconds if it interrupts a cast. 
---
Out of form you still have roots and nature's grasp. Most pvp druids will go engineering as well for even more CC.
---
Cat Form is actually pretty OP when you consider it breaks out of many roots/snares (frost nova!), not just slows, and every form breaks free of poly. Your damage won't scale nearly as hard as rogues will throughout the xpac, but you can still crit pretty hard depending on how you gear yourself.
---
LMAO thank you so much for that. I was already enjoying how much he rages at the ooga gang, this was a nice extra treat.
---
The issues are trivial.
---
Most quest item spawns are actually instant on the beta.
---
The whole.. "we're doing this for your convenience is bullshit."  It's a cost savings feature and will never be disabled.
---
a nightmare / annoying / etc. isn't unplayable though
---
the game was playable for sure, there's a difference between unplayable and annoying waiting for a mob to spawn.
---
also idk where we got info on the amount of servers and players playing already
---
The funny thing is how people truly believe that layering is only for phase 1. Not realizing that it’s a blatant lie and when phase 2 is approaching blizzard will come up with an excuse saying how the servers can’t handle it, more players are playing than expected, layering has to stay. I mean you’re pretty delusional if you think that they’ll do the AQ event without layering. The AQ event is not even doable without it, the servers will just crash over and over.
---
Often. Would probably be worth rolling a toon that can wear leather or mail.
---
Why? Because I prefer the Classic model. Simple as that. It looks simpler and a little less overdesigned. I just don't like the art style of modern WoW that much.
---
Sylvanas looked the coolest in WC3.
---
That's the point he was trying to make though. Since the beta probably has under 3500 people, or at least not 7,000, there's no way to test Layering unless you dial back the amount of players that constitutes a "layer".
---
For beta, that number is undoubtedly much much lower so Blizzard can test things.
---
That's what got me too LOL
---
6 months is pretty good for a worst case.
---
Thanks for backing up my point.
---
The level boost question to SAVE time = our game up till the current expansion is a waste of time and we don’t know what to do with it. It’s literally them saying it’s a waste of time to level up to the current content so, would you pay more on top of the game you’re already paying to play. 
---
I hope everyone says no to this question and they just fix their game or scrap it and build off classic with the classic design philosophy. Not repeating any of the already made expansion content. Build off classic with content nobody has experienced yet.
---
Reddit is usefull for IT stuff
---
EA = Activision apparently
---
You will fight over some items but it won't matter in the long run.  You can craft a lot of decent spell power items from tailoring plus the gear you get leveling tends to get replaced very quickly.
---
It's fine if you think my point is meaningless, but that doesn't mean it isn't true.
---
A survey sent to all participants of the Beta, some of which don't even play Retail or own the latest expansion, is related to Classic.
---
Your speculation that the level boosting question only related to Retail is just silly.
---
I did not record actual data but I ran Graveyard at least 30 times and saw rares probably 8 times.
---
i prefer her... WoTLK model? whatever the iteration was before the current one without the weird, shoehorned leather chest piece. 
---
tbh, i don't mind them covering her up more, but, the part of her armor covering her stomach/belly just looks off... and they never bothered fixing it. if they made it look more natural and part of her armor, it'd be fine.
---
Just like make your characters at the same time so you get into the same layer or just make it so you pick your layer when you first make your character. Guilds can form with the 3000 people on your layer just as it was in vanilla.
---
There were massive queues, I waited about 2 hours to get in on launch-day. I'm sure you can find those videos floating around YT. The starting zones were a mess, but I got into Westfall that same day. It's rough, but not impossible.
---
this is likely the reasoning. The datamined shop doesn't have any info on the contents, only an interface.
---
It was always explained you'd be able to switch layers on demand by hopping groups. You got downvoted on here for pointing that out though.
---
Level squish for current WoW is not about Classic. Should be self-evident. I was responding to your message about layering.
---
If layering/sharding/phasing is not removed from Classic, I will not resub. I dont care what new word Ion wants to call it, they are all the same thing. We have seen this since WOTLK and we see how it negatively effects the game today. PvP toggling in BFA is a terrible example. There is no fix for. It is working as designed. If there was a fix, they would have fixed it in BFA already. The only way is to remove it from Classic. It does not belong at all. “Only Phase 1” could be months. 
---
Blizzard, you have one chance to get this right. Don’t fuck it up.
---
Drat, no way to test.
---
I never saw them saying it could last into phase 2. I'd like to see that quote.
---
ahh, ok thanks for info
---
And you think they would stay 10 hour queues forever? So by that logic layering will never leave the game? 
---
&gt;I mean, it's really only your, and a few other angry neckbeards', opinion that layered servers are fundamentally "unhealthy."
---
Loving the insults. Cant fight the point fight the person, Its a large portion of people who feel like this but fuck those guys right? The original wow players should not be able to join in on the game as it was becasue ... ?
---
&gt;Nice gatekeeping there, champ. 
---
&gt;because your IRL friends are such drama queens they're cancelling their plans to play over this.
---
As above^ You are the only one gate keeping here. You are saying that anyone who wants a real classic experiance without all the bells and whistles of modern wow should not be able to play the game. 
---
Its a crying shame that classic has gone the way it has, Not even giving players an option to take the bastardized version or the version they enjoy and having people like yourself cheer that on whilst insulting players with differing opinions is gross.
---
I believe he is going tailoring so I would probably go engineering or alc
---
How does your neglected child feel about that? SMH at you parents who have to game so bad that you need to basically force your spouses to do it too so they get to spend any amount of time with you.
---
Unless I'm mistaken, Tauren HP bonus was much better in vanilla than later iterations, because it was 5% more total health rather than 5% more base health.
---
Do something productive in the meantime ... like refresh by new on r/classicwow
---
Hunter is less diseriable in raid, but will gear far easier since you only need gear for 1 spec.  Only in pvp stam is higher value, but most of the bis pieces overlap between pvp and pve.  
---
For shamans its a bit harder.  The pvp set is not ideal, as it is more of a enhancment focused set, with 2-3 pieces that are ok for ele.  Your pve gear will take longer to get, but it is typically far more focused on resto +healing gear.  T2 and AQ40 gear starts to give you straight spell power on your tier sets, and thats when the ele/resto builds really take off.  To get enough spellpower before those later phases you will need to try and snipe some non-mail spell power pieces to mix in with your other gear.
---
Completely agreed. I logged into the game during whatever expansion was out two summers ago and it was like: "Oh great, another island."
---
The only saving grace to that expansion was Bradensbook which remote seemed like a traditional MMORPG for the 30 minutes I quested there.  Shit, the continent was called "Broken Isles"
---
Look in nostalgic too. But let's not push it.
---
Upto phase 2 not into.
---
Woods is fine, but when your a NE and your purple and then everything around you is purple...I just get exhausted looking at it
---
They could have sharding in permanently, and tons of people would still play classic claiming it doesn't affect them. Blizzard is not your friend, and relying on people to vote with their wallets if they fuck up has been shown over and over to never, ever work.
---
Some of this sub is a strange combination of yearning, entitlement and anger.
---
Like, if you don't trust that Blizzard is at least trying to make a good game here, why are you on this sub and desperate to get into the game? If you're already angry about it, why not just move on with your life?
---
Are Blizzard blameless in this? Absolutely not. They've fucked up plently. But come on, why are people here so desperate and so angry about a game that isn't even released yet?
---
I was thinking the same lol. This dude.
---
Oh I understand that they could test it that way, but why would they do that without giving players a heads-up, especially when they have a whole stress test server dedicated to testing high population conditions? Even if they *are* testing it at lower pop thresholds, this isn't how it is supposed to work so I think people are freaking out prematurely.
---
Where can i see if i am able to play beta?
---
You're ignorant if you think Character Boosting didn't exist in Vanilla, you just paid Chinese farmers to level your character instead of Blizzard.  (I never did that btw)
---
But whatever, it's clear you are incapable of thinking about this topic beyond "n00b goto r3tAil MAGA"
---
I can confirm that Encrypted Sigil and the Nessa 4-part questline are the only Darnassus quests you won’t be able to get. You can complete all other Night Elf quests throughout Teldrassil, Darnassus and beyond.
---
I’m also working on Darnassus rep in the Beta, but I’m completing ALL quests at the appropriate level to get maximum Darnassus rep as well as maximum spillover Darnassus rep by completing quests from the other three factions. Even so, rep gain per quest is much less than private servers, so players shouldnt expect to hit exalted by level 40, or even close to it.
---
I don’t know if he would know about using spirit gear so I might be able to tell him it’s for healers lol
---
Don't shove 20k players into a starting zone, stick most of them in a queue. That's what's always been done, right?
---
Mainly to get a laugh. 1 or 2 days after the first 60 Mc will be completely cleared and I can have some giggle at your expense
---
Not everyone can play at the same time. Let alone an entire guild of friends.
---
I'll bet the grind and sense of reward is awesome though.
---
Lmaoooooo you think I can afford a child?
---
Don’t think viability is your issue - if you heal ok then it’s viable. I think the issue comes if you’re expected to drop mana tide and you don’t have it spec’d.
---
If raid leader ok with no mana tide then it’s just down to your performance.
---
I plan on coming to every raid with full buffs, consumea mana pots dark runes etc. I know its going to be sub optimal but if i go above and beyond consume and gear wise im hoping i can find a spot for me somewere. Honestly might even make my own guild at this point.
---
I know once AQ40 hits the content gets a bit harder so i would def respec then
---
Phase 3 I thought?
---
It's a beta. These issues showed up specifically because they made a change. That means they're actively working on changing and tweaking layering. This is not how Blizzard wants it to behave when Classic goes live.
---
Tourism. Millions of retail players who are going to check out classic for a couple of days and then quit en masse. They get the full game for free. With tbc and wotlk you had to pay to try it out.
---
On a training dummy probably pretty equal, but on an enemy player who is actively avoiding taking damage, shadow priest by like x2.  Their damage is famously hard to avoid and persistent.  Ret paladins are extremely vunlerable to kiting and control classes ranging them so that the ret never does damage.
---
Not a US promotion btw.
---
Well, when Classic goes live, the first few days/weeks will see servers filled to the brim with thousands of players. There's a very real chance you'll be slapped in to a new layer when the number hits capacity. Not telling players is how it will work when the game is live, so I guess it kind of makes sense not to tell them on beta?
---
Not disagreeing with you, but are those pserver screenshots? If so it’s hard to compare because of the fact that those were free to play alone and that there was 1-2 servers available. Blizzard having the 15/mo sub is a huge paywall that some won’t get over, and the fact that they will have different regional severs helps for example the thousands of Chinese players that just flooded the game.
---
Seriously, Blizzard, just hire this guy.
---
Is it not that it just happened to be that way, as opposed to being intentional? I remember playing Silkroad Online before WOW (during wows releases circa 04/05). And there was a quest where you had to kill like 2500 flower type monsters... 3 times over. No reward, just that was the quest. I guess it meant I didn’t run out of things to do.
---
yeah just because they do that on private servers doesn't mean they're going to be doing it on a retail version of vanilla lol highly doubt they'll be doing it in quest gear since thats basically what they'd be trying to do it in lmao. good luck I guess
---
Directly original? No but neither is 3k players champ. 5K players would be true to the gameplay experaince though, A single living world which we all take part in not 15 worlds split around which you might take part it might not its a roll of the dice. 
---
I dont want to play an MMO solo, Im sorry I just dont. If you do that fine and they should do something bonus to cater to you or me. Hell releasing a few none layered servers would solve all problems honestly.
---
This creates as many problems as it solves.
---
What happens when someone invites you for a group quest but you're on different layers?
---
What happens when your friend is on a different layer but doesn't realize until he reaches you out in the open world?
---
Really don't get the hype of this mount, although I've never really been a saber fan which is ironic seeing as I'm making Nelf druid... 😂 I'll probs go for a  mechanostrider instead
---
Not really that impressive
---
I wonder if when this happens you are being forcibly moved to a different layer.
---
That's fine I'll just go kill some boars while 80 dumbasses stand around getting zero xp for a quest that will give hardly any xp at all.
---
PvE rogues have some of the most monotonous rotations in the game, I'm afraid. Some people fiddle around with daggers, most with swords, but at the end of the day you'll be forced to play boring Combat spec.
---
SS x5 then evis, keeping slice and dice up
---
Ratstallion took me way longer than this
---
I mean people could just wait and do it together. They literally have to do the same shit to raid just with 40 people. Or like I said just let people choose their layer when they first make their character.
---
No one else has suggested this idea?
---
Ah ok thanks. Is it at least cheaper in terms of gold?
---
Even the (presumably less powerful) beta servers have shown to be perfectly stable with multiple 40 man raids clashing, easily 100+ people in an area. This is not an issue unless Blizzard makes it one by underprovisioning their servers.
---
I saw the raptor drop once and we had to bid gold on it, we had a rich af troll mage and he won the bid, what a waste ...
---
Yeah i am a half decent healer and will def come prepared with consumes all enchants dark runes mana pots etc. I just love to pvp and would hate spending an insane amount of gold every week to respec...other option is to just run a sm/ruin lock..hmmm
---
Mages can't wear warlock tier gear. Alliance locks gear up quicker. And you don't have any high lvl vanilla pvp experience if you say "noone dies inside a deathcoil" DC &gt;Immolate &gt; Conflag &gt; shadowburn combo will kill you instantly if the warlock has aq 40 gear or higher.
---
I think mechanostriders were restricted to dwarves and gnomes in vanilla. Night Elves too fat.
---
ah yeah shame on Activision Blizzard wanting to make money lol
---
I never left?
---
You made the whole point of the video the thumbnail. Why would I watch when I can see the crit right there?
---
If you do test botting on Classic, it'd at least be pretty interesting.
---
So it's 5% health which is nice for your health pool, but doesn't provide any actual mitigation. It makes recovering from chunky damage easier for sure. 
---
However if you're spiking so often that the 5% health makes a different then there are probably more pressing concerns you should handle.
---
Overall it's a *good* bonus but not **huge**.
---
When someone contradicts themselves, that is the definition of oxymoron. Not to be confused with the word moron. English is hard I know.
---
Yeah you’re right. The 5-6 months should be accurate still, but it’s after phase 2. Phase 3 would be BGs
---
They've said before phase 2 and also said a few weeks into release, but obviously you're going to work off of the assumption it'll be several months instead of being tentative and actually seeing what will happen.
---
&gt;What. Having some reading difficulties there? I said nothing of the sort.
---
Doesn't have to be said.
---
&gt;They have said no such thing, and in the beta it's clear that no limitations exist on rares, chests, or similar. This is 100% your own personal speculation, which goes against everything that we know.
---
It's. A. Beta. It's crazy how this is lost on so many people. What's the point of the beta? To test things out, to fix and change things. You really are hoping for the absolute worst.
---
&gt;Oh wow, an unironic "ItS JuSt bEtA". Way to lose all remaining credibility.
---
Sorry, should've said the beta is the finished product, that should get me plenty of karma and credibility on this sub.
---
Yeah having 100 servers, half of which are dead.  Great idea.
---
I'm sure we all wanted to play Vanilla wow not some abomination of legion that looks like Vanilla.
---
This is top quality content and every post should be like this, not some shitty meme post or some loser streamer that gets to the front page within minutes.
---
No horde questing here, eh? And in your version of highlands, alliance gets 4 horde gets 2. So you obviously play a troll shaman right?  
---
in all seriousness, these are rad and I love seeing them in the feed.
---
I agree. I also think the run on the classic servers will be unprecedented. Since it's part of the normal subscription we'll see EVERYONE trying to log in. 
---
Level 20 was admittedly PUMA, but I'm sure there's an optimal number to find. The idea is to have a threshold after which you're permanently in the same one world, together with all your friends if you've planned for it in advance. In Vanilla the choice of the realm was a huge commitment, it needs to be that way again.
---
It was unfinished on release, making 55-60 quite a grind, but they completed the zone in one of the first patches.
---
Its the only epic tiger mount without the random unnecessary armor.
---
Your hitting out of the park my dude, great stuff.
---
you guys are dangerously close to having a productive conversation
---
Interesting, I appreciate the response. I've heard that the warstomp comboes can really change the tide of a battle, so thanks for the specific chains. 
---
I know you mentioned that hardiness might not be as useful for a ele shaman when compared to it's usefulness for orcs as a whole due to matchup strengths and trinket, but I wonder about the flipside. 
---
Do grenades make warstomp not as crucial? It seems that much of PVP has evolved around using engi and grenades, and hardiness also provides a defense against these stuns that any class can use. Are you able to substitute a grenade for warstomp and still effectively run the same combos?
---
&gt; Odds are one has spawned there on other layers as well. 
---
But that's not how black lotus spawning works at all.
---
Greater blessings are a thing in 1.12
---
those yeti horns tho
---
And acting like layering is something that won't be removed solves what problem?
---
Would be perfect for a new series of the old TV commercials.
---
"I'm Mr. T and I'm a Night. Elf. Mohawk!"
---
Can people stop with these posts about layering?  They are aware of the issues.  Adn btw the issues that arise with not layering are more catastrophic.  So let them find a solution that works, this is beta.  Test the stuff, report stuff using their ingame tools.  Reddit posts do nothing.
---
I respectfully disagree here. If you strafe kite, engage mobs at max range, and take advantage of your auto shot reload time to move. It’s actually one of the strongest classes 1-10 imho
---
Morons downvoted you but you’re correct. Most of the people in here do not even understand what layering is.
---
Yeah, the quest design is not well done. You get a quest chain from a dude who wants you to kill harpies all the way in the northwestern part of the zone which involves going back and forth THREE times to finish it. It's just brutal at that level range.
---
man that would be rad, I wonder if they'd actually do it!
---
*repeatable done for days on days
---
15*
---
I'd say lower the level, make it essentially alliance only, and then flesh out azshara Horde-side.
---
So really just pre-60 leveling then like with the SM library staff?  Even in the phase 2-6 he has blades listed though.
---
In terms of design/layout, any chance you could have an alternate view for loot, or something off to the side? I'd appreciate just a simple table with slot, name, where to get it, and a link. It'd be a lot easier to flip through vs. clicking on each piece, but I do like being able to just click and see the item stats and everything.
---
It'd also be interesting if you could make a small line that lists the total benefits from all the gear together, like total +spirt, +healing, +spell dmg, etc, just to get a better feel for how much of an impact a non-bis item has if you need to make some replacements.
---
Big fan of your site though, great job!
---
thank you for your great work
---
I dont remember alot of problems with priest but then again I havent played in along time and never pvpd at 60 (dinged 60 day TBC came out)
---
Are you actually doing these changes in Noggit and taking a picture from a zoomed out perspective?
---
A lot of people feel burned by Blizzard and thus jump to the most negative conclusion they can think of. While I understand that to a certain degree, I think it's pretty clear this isn't directed at classic players. Despite the recent hate, I still like blizzard as a company and their products are still above par for the industry, they know what they're doing.
---
Then it’s not a promotion at all.
---
the question is why was one layer full of horde, the other alliance?
---
the handful of horde players in the ally dominated layer (i was one of them) were unable to drag players in from the horde layer by inviting. its seems obvious that the reason is the layer was 'full' of alliance players, and had no room for horde.
---
if the layering took faction balance into account, this shouldnt have been a problem.  if layers can hold 3000 players, and it took factions into account, you would think it would have roughly 1500 of each side, then creating a new layer for the overflow of the overpopulated faction first.  ther should have been no way there wasnt room for a couple of horde raid groups on the same layer as the alliance groups...unless the alliance had filled up the majority of the 3000 player slots already.
---
They had to design the game around too many people in 1 zone on wrath launch. That is why 2 starting zones exist.
---
Because release will be an absolute shitshow and no one will be able to play the actual game except for a lucky few that didn't get stuck in a 30k queue. I don't like layering but I see why they have to implement it in the beginning and I'm not going to act like it'll kill the entire experience, because it won't.
---
I noticed this effect happening with the Gnarlpine Ambushers in Ban'ethil Hollow in Teldrassil.
---
Just one comment ago you said it was his opinion, now he's wrong? Opinions don't care about objectivity, my dude
---
Feral is not as strong as rogue, and if you lack pvp gear I think the gap is even larger in favor of the rogue.  
---
Realize feral does have a stun in bash, and a kick in feral charge, but both require shifting to bear to do it.  Deep full feral builds can struggle with mana from shifting too much, so thats why a lot of vanilla druids end up having to wear some functionally resto gear.  You end up with your stats spread over more categories, so lacking raid gear is more noticable.
---
Maybe if you spent time learning a valuable skill instead of spending 100% of your free time on Vidya.
---
jesus thats a lot of work
---
no I'm messing about in paint.net
---
Kinda my thought, vanilla used to have 3-4 k caps on high pop servers iirc.
---
&gt;  but obviously you're going to work off of the assumption it'll be several months
---
I'm going off of information given by a Blizzard employee. But I'm sure you, a random redditor, knows better than Blizzard.
---
&gt;Doesn't have to be said.
---
Why do you like to sexually assault kids? WTF is wrong with you?
---
&gt;It's. A. Beta. It's crazy how this is lost on so many people.
---
Hahahaha, let me guess, you get scammed by Nigerian princes on a daily basis, don't you?
---
Thanks for the info. So do you think as someone who is probably a bit on the more casual side it's going to be a bit easier for me to gear up decently on a hunter? Just try get into a raid when I can and focus on the PvP set?
---
That relies on a few assumptions to be correct, mainly that the ratio of high level characters to low level characters will be different. I'm not so sure that'll be true, there were a *lot* of vanilla players that weren't focused on getting to max level at all.
---
It is probably a mistake to think of yourself as a holy priest.  Every healing priest build is some combo and disc and holy, just depends on how much in each.  
---
The overwhelming majority of healing priests level as shadow and just respec later.
---
Not just the sunscales, but the sunwomen and the sunchildren, too.
---
Silverpine is pretty good I thought.  It doesn't get you anywhere close to 20 from 12 in one straight go though.  You can get to 15, leave for barrens, quest a bit, and then come back at 18.
---
Could you make a place to put the items that are hard to get or rare? I know dalrends are good, but ironfoe is better.
---
There's a troll there and he gives you the quest I think? You have to raise a baby raptor and eventually it grows up and you can ride it. Much easier than the Winterspring one I'd say
---
Where is that a thing? Are you referring to the troll post above?
---
Woah woah woah? Why is everyone freaking out at me?
---
Im not super wellversed in the community or anything and its just that I hadnt seen the thrown out before
---
Im sorry that this offended everyone so much

I'd be really interested to see how you would handle zones like Gilneas, Quel'thalas/Zul'Aman with its Vanilla map shape, Hyjal, or Uldum. Maybe even Tel'Abim or Zandalar.
---
Great work!
---
Chernobyl
---
You're assuming that the factions weren't balanced on the layer each group was on, though. Is there any evidence that that was the case? How do you know that the layer with a bunch of Alliance grouped up didn't have a Horde population equal to the one that had the Horde players grouped up, just with them all spread out? Even if each group had 100 people get together, it wouldn't have a major impact on layers that are handling 2k+ players.
---
wtf is going on in that image with tanaris/ungoro/silithus? 
---
i am confuse.
---
thats because the population on those privates was over 10k. where in retail the MAX is like 3.5k per server
---
Have fun grinding Darnassus rep to Exalted first
---
Exactly.  It's only expected to be a clusterfuck the first week or two.  By two weeks time you're already going to see people creating fresh toons, while others are hitting 60 at the same time.  No need for layering once this spread happens.
---
&gt; That'd be great, except [the post you removed](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c07dyq/-/) and these comments have nothing to do with Layering...
---
I'm actually working on that right now lol
---
Won't be as bad as you think, you can actually split stat priority a lot easier than you think. Are you leveling spriest?
---
Priest I'd recommend prioritizing +spirit and mp5 over all other stats, just taking whatever you can for everything else. Warlock can prioritize +shadow damage, +spell damage, +int, and +stam.
---
Ideally though, yeah having someone go leather/mail/plate would mean a lot less competition and be much smoother.
---
Oh I definitely misunderstood that then!
---
I think you did a good job with this :).  Keep up the good work.
---
Yeah.  All I can say is we kept being dropped off of flight paths.
---
Why only a week?  Plenty of players will just be playing casually and will still be clumped into the same low zones for awhile.
---
They should permanently shard early zones 1-5 or 1-20 or something, and never shard content past that.
---
new one with old voice!
---
What are you talking about man? I didnt get sent by anyone im not trying to spam im sorry
---
That's not what they announced at their stock meeting. And since they don't release their numbers it's impossible to know. But I'll agree and say sure, less people now. So what? 
---
How does having less people playing make them drop off faster than In the past? It wouldn't. The worst MMO releases of all time took at least 6 months to lose 50% and you are here saying in just a few months we are going to have that kind of drop off? I just don't agree. Let's say I did though, ok now what? We are going to bend over for blizzard because this will make merges easier in 5+ months? How does that make any sense?
---
My Bwana.
---
I didn’t ask.  /u/Nerotiic did.  
---
From what I understood, he was asking for proof about corpse camping, since that what was being discussed earlier:
---
&gt;They don't camp. I think that is the main reason no one hates them.
---
The clip you provided did not show corpse camping, it just showed ganking and rage quitting.
---
Yeah if i find a guild that will let me run the ele resto hybrid spec i would have no issue switching specs if we were to hit a wall. Ultimatley i do want to progress. When things go wrong people start looking for weakest links (meme specs, underperforming etc)
---
No they haven't said anything about how they will be releasing these sets.
---
The sarcasm has come full circle.
---
The real question is the following though: is (s)he old enough to farm...?
---
Looks like fun times were had.
---
&gt;But here's where it gets funky beyond the expected layering. Crossing the Durotar border into the gates of Org actually phased you away from those in Durotar.   
---
To me having played in Wod, legion and BFA this is the standard of current wow.  When you cross into another zone, especially the capital the shards collapse into other server shards.  You lose your targets on NPCs and enemies, but you keep targets for your party if they are in the same zone area.  If your party is out in durotar and you are in orgrimmar, you will not see each other across zone boundaries.  
---
To me, I think they need to have specific zone sharding or they will have people loot lagging or spells stop responding in the heavy populated zones for launch and patch days.  The alternative to not having multiple servers is players not being able to control their character, or players putting up AFK macros so they won't be logged out and get sent to the back of a 50,000 player queue.
---
I can understand that. It is cool to see the big numbers roll by.
---
I can't believe that after all the hype and waiting I may still end up on a fucking private server.
---
That's such a dumb suggestion
---
They should have asked a follow up question after the boost one.
---
Would you get a boost for free? NOPE
---
Ah. You mean a since deleted post that was obvious bait? You got bamboozled friend.
---
MCP gives a multiplicitive DPS increase from the attack speed and matters more the better gear you have. It's honestly a fairly huge DPS increase. Farm these like consumables, use them like Potions. Don't think of them like weapons, they're potions. You want a backup weapon.  More hardcore minmaxers than myself say MCP needs to be up and active 100% of the time, but thats not practical. 
---
Crit chance isn't a problem because you're attacking twice as conventional ret. Jackhammer has an effective 1.7 speed, and MCP is a 1.2 speed. As long as you're attacking quickly, and get a few percent from gear, you should be fine. I like getting about 3 or 4% from gear. Battleborn Armbraces and Eye of Rend is usually enough crit to be fine from there on out. 
---
in t2 when you fill out judgement and have no crit on all 8 pieces, you might want to fill out jewlery with melee pieces. 
---
More often than not, a hybrid setup is optimal. You can't really ignore melee stats, but you dont care at all about STR, just Hit and Crit. If a piece has STR+SP great, its probably really good.
---
Lol “it’s only the beta” 
---
“It’s just been released”
---
“It’s only the first patch”
---
“They will fix it next time”
---
Our atlas is bigger and better than ever. Each continent and zone is usable just like in game with a bonus satellite view to give you a real feel of each zone. But wouldn’t it be cool to be able to dive in deeper and actually click on that cave on the map? We’ve got you covered!
---
It’s been a big task to capture it all, but you can now access all of the world cave and building maps! Ever wish you had a quick reference to the infamous Barrow Dens in Teldrassil? How about the underground area in Searing Gorge? How long is the Deeprun Tram? Look no further. It’s all mapped and selectable. With over 300 sub areas and some small Easter eggs, have fun diving into all the nooks and crannies of Azeroth.
---
We will continue to be working on the atlas to get you dungeon and raid maps next with some basic map markers. After that the atlas will keep expanding the features and display capabilities to make this a comprehensive reference for everyone.
---
It's not all bad. Just depends on who controls nesingwary's camp. Res, pick up/turn in all your quests, run like hell res at max distance away from camp :).
---
I was thinking the same
---
Well, a lot of things take effort for sure, attunements for dungeons and raids. But some things and some grinds take so much much much longer to complete, but those grinds are for things that are not necssary, such as top tier patterns/formulas, mounts, pets, but just for showing off. And some of these things are totally worth it, especially enchanting formulas.
---
The only bamboozling here is that you guys are pushing an agenda. Blizzard asked Beta players if they'd mind a leveling boost. You deleted the thread exposing it.
---
I'd love to use the new models, but there is another small hangup. We'd still have all the old models and textures on the armor, which would look even more janky on the new (really great looking) character models.
---
Because you'll make a fool of yourself.
---
I don't get it.
---
I believe people have said this is a layering issue. If Blizzard just confined layering to the starting zones a lot of these issues would be fixed.
---
Why am I here and desperate to get into the game? Because Vanilla WoW is the greatest MMORPG ever made and I want to experience it again. It was made when Blizzard was a different company. I wouldn't trust current Blizzard to cook an omlet for me. I don't care about Blizzard making money or whatever the hell they are doing with retail right now. I just want to play high quality authentic Vanilla WOW, which I couldn't do for the last 15 years. For that reason I will fight to have the true Vanilla back, and if I don't like I won't play it and I will spend time convincing others they shouldn't play it as well... we are the only reason WoW Classic is even happening, if it is exactly like Vanilla its because of us again... and if Blizzard thinks they can introduce "modern" solutions to the game and still have our money they are mistaken. They will get exactly 0$ from me if they fuck this up.
---
I'm not sure why you are even asking this, but here goes:
---
a - They don't have Old AV.
---
b - They are giving us 1.12 which had AV.
---
c - AV has AV exclusive items you can get.
---
Rogue list appears to go from dungeon items (mask of the unforgiven/truestrike shoulders) straight to BWL tierset (Bloodfang) and skips right over Nightslayer (t1).
---
I think that might have to do with the fact that those private servers had only one actual server. Blizzard has multiple
---
CLASSIC WON'T BE VANILLA UNTIL PHASE 2.
---
If you're only leveling off rested XP and have limited play times then it's doable but if you're planning on playing 4-8 hours a day only in instances it's going to take much longer. They did add bonus party XP so maybe it's better in 1.12 but it's still gonna be slower, even with a full server and instant groups.
---
I normally do this with my alts. Get em to level 20 so they can run DM and then just run a few dungeons when you have a full rested XP bar.
---
This is really cool, the layout is much easier on the eyes
---
Couple of suggestions
---
1. Dont link to wowhead, link to classicdb instead
---
2. Cassandra's Grace (helm) is listed as bis for holy priest but will be unobtainable for most people because of its low drop rate and high price
---
IIRC yes you need both :/
---
Wish it would link to classicdb instead of wowhead though
---
You get focused on every class.  Everything other then bear druid, SL lock, or someone with a shield on feels basically equally squishy.  You likely will have as much armor as a rogue with inner fire up.  Shadowform is particularly not squishy, although deep shadow would not really compliment your allies very much.  
---
Priest complements those two more then mage does, just because heals and dispels are so important.  If you could recruit a healer, then mage would also work great.
---
Seems like your the one stomping your feetsies.  Sorry my feelings on the matter made you upset.
---
We hope
---
I remember being there during those types of screen shots on private servers. Most fun iv ever had, Met a lot of good people. 
---
I dont consider it a shit show at all I consider it a real living world which is the 1 thing I really want WoW to be, You dont I get that but why not have 50% sharded servers and 50% non sharded? Why do we all have to play your sharded version of the game with all the downsides that brings?
---
Thank you...I really wasnt trying to make anyone mad. Im just a fan of classic wow trying to come up with possible solutions to something everything is really upset over...i didnt expect people to get upset over that
---
Hunter / warlock will shit on everything's face.
---
Well, that is what Blizzard explained themselves in regards to tourism. If they are wrong, there's a much bigger problem, as it means population wouldn't dwindle off over time.
---
I'm not that stressed, just wondering why the did it. I get that it allows for better server management but now for no reason people all over the continent will be tied to starting zone population and a whole host of other issues.
---
&gt;Claims that Troggs only know how to use rocks
---
&gt; Uses picture of Trogg wielding an axe
---
so if youre being ganked or you killed all the mobs in an area you can just shard to another world ? nice, gj blizzard
---
Some people enjoy BFA (I dont). Good is subjective, he wasnt wrong. "No layering past p1" is not subjective, its an objective statement.
---
Looks great. 
---
Only thing I have to add is that you could consider calling it 'Skeleton Cove' instead, a reference to the [Skeleton Coast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton_Coast), a similar way to how Un'Goro Crater is named.
---
I think the quests open up at 55. It's possible to grind to 60 doing it, but a lot of the time is spent running between the quest giver and the mobs. There are faster more efficient ways to hit 60.
---
However, if you are in no rush to hit 60 and plan on doing the grind anyway, then go ahead and start up at level 55.
---
I don't know if I should go Warrior or Mage. I want to do mostly PvE, and if I would play Warrior I would like to offtank. Just want to raid and do dungeons with a guild, nothing else really matters ( I want some gear though!). Scared that both of these classes are overplayed but I am set on one of these, as long as it's possible to get a raid slot and get into dungeons.
---
You gonna be so behind!
---
Nope. Did it in vanilla as a human mage. This was the 4th epic mount I owned. I definitely don’t have a 1,000 hours to commit to this grind again. Glad I did it back then though, it really is a special mount that stands out. Full Netherwind helped speed it up big time. Full set 10% proc was amazing then. Good luck to those that go for it this time around.
---
Sharding isn't in the beta, you must be thinking of layering. It's not surprising that it's happening though since the system is there. It would be a lot weirder if it didn't happen.
---
A good idea if your duo leveling and share a same armor/weapon type is to plan out different rewards you get from quests that what you both can benefit.
---
HEY GUIS!!  It's only for starting zones!!!!  It's only for phase one!!!! Layering is not sharding!!!!  It's called beta testing.. they're testing it!!!!!
---
You don't know if the subs would have been higher had their not been the problems there were.  Just because something was successful doesn't mean it couldn't have been better.
---
Oof that's tough. Good luck!
---
I mean in all fairness people make the wintersaber grind sound bad but in reality its nothing compared to any OSRS grind. 
---
Overall its fine, it just requires some dedication/vigilance because of ganking etc
---
edit: but then again I havent done it myself, only what I've heard so don't shoot me
---
This isn't feasible because now you have dead servers. When people leave those new servers it's horrendous and creates an awful playspace, especially in a community driven game. Server merges are even worse because it's just hard layering vs virtual layering.
---
I can answer the Timeworn Mace point: it's too slow.  In fact, there is a strong case for Silent Fang being the bis here due to the 1.6 attack speed.
---
However, this illustrates a problem with bis lists in general.  Now only is it so complicated that we're all going to get things wrong, but sometimes it is even subjective.
---
Fuck yeah man - make a character and only get to level 12 :)
---
You deserve it more than anyone on this sub - not joking.
---
Oh what?! Then I really misunderstood the concept. That's hot garbage.
---
I thought it was a large number of layers for the first weeks after release, only to be narrowed down later. If layers change daily and can be influenced by the players the system is doomed from the start.
---
This just happened in BFA beta, people kept downvoting legit feedback and saying, chill its just beta, and most of those things went live and people complained.
---
What? No. That wasn't what OP suggested either. They suggested layering for only a few zones. Once you left those zones you would simply merge into one big permanent layer.
---
For the record, I don't think it's a solution either but I just didn't think it was as simple as saying you're moving the bottleneck to a different location either.
---
Just saying for the people in the US who get disappointed like I did :(
---
I sleep
---
Actually Blizzard doesn't give a shit about fixing the majority issues in Betas.
---
For references, see BFA beta .. Legion beta .. Warlords beta ... etc ...
---
its confirmed for at least the first couple of months.
---
Warlock and Priest both want +spell power while leveling. The only time you won't fight over gear is when something has +healing on it instead.
---
&gt; Shield slam dmg is not 75% of mortal strike w a good two hander. Never mind sweeping strikes which is the real OP part of being arms that you conveniently ignore.
---
At level 40 it is (in fact it's about 80% of the damage), and this will *generally* hold true throughout the ranks/levels until you hit max level and gear starts having a bigger impact on things.
---
Assuming [these stats](https://i.imgur.com/mZukmup.png) (first result of a roughly level 40 Warrior I could find online) and Whirlwind Axe for a weapon and any itemlevel 41 shield, Mortal Strike will be hitting for an average of 320 while Shield Slam will hit for an average of 262. That's 81% of the damage, but Shield Slam only costs 20 rage while MS is 30. This calculation ignores damage/crit chance bonuses from talents, of course, but even with those the difference will not be massive.
---
&gt;You can hamstring kite with a 2h which mitigates the dmg without having to use a shield.
---
You can hamstring kite with 1H too. Hamstring isn't limited to two-handed weapons, and the 0.5 seconds faster attack speed on a one-hander is not going to ruin your strategy... assuming hamstring kiting even works properly in Classic given that the mob pathing and range mechanics are different from private servers.
---
&gt;Its not just a feeling. 2 handers give bigger whirlwinds, bigger cleaves, bigger mortal strikes.
---
Yes, by about the 25% damage difference between one-handed and two-handed weapons. Weapon speed was normalized for instant attacks long before 1.12. The main reason you want a slow weapon post-weapon speed normalization is for PvP burst damage, and I think Rend might still get some extra scaling for slower weapons.
---
Lol get fucking wrecked.
---
August 26/27 for you!
---
I never down voted the comments, or the post. My reaction was simply, we don't know if this is how it will be at launch. 
---
Hopefully it isn't.
---
The population of many servers *did* dwindle and die during vanilla, though. Basically, I'm saying that it would need to be proven that there will be very few of the "tourist" players who don't stick around to higher levels for what you said about 5x more high level resources without 5x more high level players to be true. The truth is that we just don't know exactly how that's going to play out yet, all we can really do is guess.
---
Realistically, it won't be that big of a problem. The amount of BoE drops this would encompass is very small. Dungeon stuff,  maybe. But really, you outlevel gear while leveling so quickly that it isn't that big of a deal. Of course you'll be wanting some of the same Pre-BiS raid gear and later legit BiS raid gear but chances are if he wasn't a clothy in the group, you'd be fighting over it with another clothy anyways. 
---
On the other side of the argument, priest/warlock leveling is some of the most efficient there is combo-wise and spriest/lock is probably the most feared class combination there is in world pvp. I'm rolling priest main and am leveling with an experienced warlock main. We aren't letting a small bit of loot competition get in the way of the two classes we want to play.
---
Love the site, but it would be cool if you had a way of showing the 2nd, 3rd, nth. . . BIS item kinda like [https://www.osrsbestinslot.com/best-in-slot-gear/](https://www.osrsbestinslot.com/best-in-slot-gear/) does.

Welcome to every forum ever. Not all replies will contribute to the discussion, that doesnt mean the others cant discuss it.
---
Don’t worry dude, people here get so butt hurt over trivial things.
---
A living world where people have fun outside of the pre assigned rails set for us? Cant be having that now.
---
I'm a grown adult too and don't have much time to game. But I would rather sit in queue for a while (which you greatly overexegerating btw) than have to put up with layers of Warcraft
---
A video of you making one of these zones would be cool.
---
I'd love to be able to mess around like this in paint.net.
---
It's horde only, but I believe it wasn't added until TBC or maybe WotLK anyway.
---
anything similar for warlock? :)
---
flying confirmed
---
Only 50%? It's been a few minutes since I suggested 30% now 50% sounds low too
---
30/21 is good for PvP, its the spec. Some people prefer 31/20 but most people opt for NS.
---
You can actually get by in raids with a 30/21 spec. Obviously your healing will be better full resto, but you can do it. Pretty much as long as your not in a caster group and you are expected to drop Mana Tide, you can do 30/21
---
Totally could be, ive not tanked raids where wing buffets and threat reductions become a worry--so I've never really felt compelled to look that up.
---
But I use battle/demo a lot in 5 mans.
---
Get gear and you'll be fine.
---
Spec however you want while leveling. If it doesn't help your current abilities - don't take it.
---
Not available in my region.
---
Well fuck you too blizzard.
---
It's probably because you're too young. Not a bad thing, just saying.
---
I would be lvling spriest then I would go disc or holy.
---
But I wouldn’t mind playing a hunter, warrior or shaman most the classes look fun in classic so playing something else isn’t really and issue for me
---
Yeah, good luck selling server merges to the player base.  Great way to kill a server's community.  Look, best way is to compromise for a couple weeks and be guaranteed to play on a densely populated server.  That option is FAR better than picking a dead server and transferring a year later.
---
I have never watched a single one of his streams, actually. I just know who he is and have seen a couple youtube videos of him. It doesn't matter if I was a fanboy or not though, it's the same situation as every youtuber/streamer that is popular... why would they quit essentially a "dream" job to get a "real" one that is less enjoyable and makes less money?
---
this is why we need WoW 2. imagine if STV was 4x bigger like holy shit man
---
The moment they start making changes like this to make the game "better", the game will eventually be on its way to become retail2. Everyone will just ask for WoW Actual Classic hahaha
---
Might want to take your own advice - in this case, the valuable skill you need to learn is how to take a joke.
---
god damn blizzard you were so close to doing classic right :(
---
This is what broke my guilds 2005 attempt at DKP.  People acting like they don't want 10dps upgrades all in collusion to keep prices at minimum.
---
I was the 420th upvote on this post. I was going to reply about how much of a cool coincidence and interesting anecdote this was, but 420 has been deemed far more important.
---
First off why would you ever play lfr, it’s just straight garbo.  Second, it doesn’t matter if you are a tank or healer or dps or whatever, because while tanks and healers may be more “important”, guilds need to recruit a lot more dps.  If you are good at your role its not hard at all to find a guild.
---
Having done the 1-60 grind on a priest semi-recently I can say priests aren't nearly as bad to level as people think. They come out to be much faster than shamans, warriors, or rogues, and most of the solo grinding is very chill / AFK (dot up a few mobs and wand to death)
---
Shadow priests are very fun, but getting into raids is a bit tough. Most groups don't tend to bring along SPs due to the limited amount of debuff space available on mobs - SP/warlock dots run the risk of removing a more important debuff such as sunder, curses, faerie fire, etc
---
Elemental is a fun spec to play once you're geared, though they oom *very* quickly and you'll end up as windfury bot more often than you might like. Just food for thought
---
&gt;No layers would make the game unplayable on launch
---
Says who? If I cant quest im going to mess around, Chat with other players, Go kill myself running to the horde starting zones and fighting them all. It will not be unplayable you just wont be able to stay on the rails and instead have some organic fun. 
---
Even so if thats the case give me the choice? Let me play on a non layered realm if I choose to right? Dont force me to play the bastardized version or not play at all.

^^I ^^am ^^a ^^bot.  ^^Feedback ^^appreciated.
---
&gt;And you think they would stay 10 hour queues forever? So by that logic layering will never leave the game? 
---
Never said that, champ.  Might want to brush up on your reading comprehension a bit.
---
&gt;Loving the insults. Cant fight the point fight the person, Its a large portion of people who feel like this but fuck those guys right? The original wow players should not be able to join in on the game as it was becasue ... ?
---
I fought the point; tossing in an insult doesn't invalidate my argument, no matter how hurt your feefees are.
---
And if you're really interested in playing the game "as it was," you'd recognise that replicating the original *experience* (ie, number of players running around a zone, competing for quests and resources) is a hell of a lot more important than replicating what the servers are doing in the background (layering).  
---
What is this "original wow players" crap anyway?  Do you think nobody who disagrees with you is an original WoW player, just a bunch of modern retail scrubs?
---
&gt;As above^ You are the only one gate keeping here. You are saying that anyone who wants a real classic experiance without all the bells and whistles of modern wow should not be able to play the game. 
---
Wanting as many people as possible to be able to play the game rather sitting in queues for hours is gatekeeping?  And being okay with layering as a temporary solution to handle the massive initial influx of players until populations stabilise is "all the bells and whistles of modern wow?"  Get a fucking grip, man.
---
&gt;Its a crying shame that classic has gone the way it has, Not even giving players an option to take the bastardized version or the version they enjoy and having people like yourself cheer that on whilst insulting players with differing opinions is gross.
---
Yeah, it really is a shame Blizzard couldn't crank out three hundred slightly different versions to cater to everyone who wanted a slightly different game but instead had to choose what they thought would be the best option for the most people.
---
And if course, it's only people like me, the ones who aren't upset about layering, who are insulting others, amirite?
---
Keep rocking that persecution complex, bud, it's a great look on you.
---
Ya I would imagine I just always seem to be a healer or a tank and as much as I want to try going a pure dps class I worry I will regret not healing or tanking
---
And then complain blizzard isn't adding new content. It's crazy.
---
Wow (no pun intended - very ambitious project and it looks like you’ve delivered.  Well done!
---
When has this ever caused dead servers in the past? Classic wow had to actually ADD servers after a few months. Sure we can expect it to be different now, but it could swing the other way just as easily and be an unexpected superhit.
---
Let's say servers lost 50% of their player base a month after launch. This would never happen but let's entertain the idea. They would still be populated enough to not have a merge. Everything would be fine still. Let's say another month passes and they lose another 50%
---
A game losing ~75% of it's player base 2 months after release is unheard of, but let's say it happens and they have to merge servers. We are now two months into release and you are just now having to server merge. And this is worst fucking case. So server merges, you try to login and...have to change your name because pwner is already taken, fucker. So you are now superpwner. You log in. God my immersion is so fucking broken. This is such a fucking hassle.
---
Needless to say I totally disagree with you.
---
We probably won’t plan much but I think we will follow a guide
---
Their racials are definitely best for min/max dps and tps, but I love the whole dwarf aesthetic, and stoneform was always an ace up my sleeve when I get a disease/poison/bleed and no one in the group has the right dispel. And being able to break out of blind is handy too in wPVP.
---
You'll regret it at 60 when you guys have to find a group:)
---
Im pretty sure he meant post naxx content vanilla+ instead of tbc,wotlk...
---
I did it once before but I had a sprained ankle and I was 16.
---
With layering there may or may not be server merges in the future.  Which is the point of layering, trying to avoid servers going low pop and having to be merged.  Without layering there will be merges and low pop servers that will have to be dealt with.
---
We just received 4 servers where I work this week at $560k+.  I'm not sure what kind additional equipment Blizz would need to "buy more servers" as you put it but most companies are unwilling to make large financial investments into hardware that will be turned off in 12 months.  No company that n their right mind is going to spends thousands $$$ to host low population servers.  
---
This is one of those features that we're going to have to work with if we want to play on official servers.  And as the tourists leave and some players remember how incomplete the world was and quit the layering will go away.  
---
For those dead set against layering pservers are still a thing until classic launches.  Though I imagine the Blizz lawyers will be going crazy on the pservers once Classic is up and running.
---
More power doesn't equal better looks, especially not for magic users.
---
They are the same thing with a different name. Dont let blizzard fool us.
---
The thing is, this CAN NOT happen ever in Classic.
---
Damn
---
Will check this out after work. Thanks.
---
Blizzard has shown nothing but care and respect for Classic. Spell batching, phases for content, loot acquisition fears in 5 mans, etc.
---
Not sure if people remember this, but early in WoW's development there was a lot negative emotions around Everquest's constant expansion dropping. Players felt it was very greedy, and Blizzard was very aware of that sentiment.
---
I can't remember who (I think it was Kaplan) talked about how WoW was being designed to have no expansions, and was a big reason for the seamless world with some inaccessible zones. The initial plan was centered on the $15/mo subscription justifying both server maintenance AND future content.
---
Zones like Hyjal, Gilnaes, Gim Batol, etc... those were set aside with that in mind.
---
The game sucked me in for a million other reasons, but I really hope (if I'm remembering this right) that they reconsider their strategy that seems to be driving people away from the game.
---
^
---
/signed
---
I never said 50% dropoff, but it could be like that. There will be a huge influx of player who are coming back to check it out, or players from retail coming over to check it out that will not stick around.  The majority of players that create a classic account wont even get close to 60.  Before phase 2 comes out the active player base will be significantly lower than it will be in the first week.  You can try and argue against that all you want.  Blizzard believes it.  Game analysts believe it.  A ton of fans believe it. 
---
Layering is their fix for it.  To me layering is just a fancier version of sharding.  I don't think layering or sharding are a good solution to this problem.  I also don't think having 10x the servers at launch is a good solution.  By doing the layering they can keep the player populations more condensed on a realistic number of servers.  More servers = less people per server = less active server, which in turn would lead to a quicker player drop off.  It's not the best solution, and hopefully they come up with a good way to prevent abuses of it, but its better than sharding or adding more servers.
---
damn thats awesome. the only thing i can see you improve is the awesome blasty hit from the sword
---
They do not. Which is why Alliance rogues all use Shadow Oil.
---
The problem is server merges cause an immediate neckbeard shitstorm.
---
#NO CHANGES
---
I've been seeing a lot of people say that if Blizzard added content to classic, it would be more level 60 zones or T4+ raiding. I would love to see more zones and dungeons like this to add to the leveling experience and help fill some holes in questing/leveling/bis gear that could also help give a boost to some undertuned class specs. Nice work!
---
Good point. I'm not seeking fame and glory, would just like to do something creative on the side.
---
They are incomplete, but the world map doesn't match what's actually in game my guess is the world map is a snapshot from an earlier version and they didn't update it
---
Tanaris and silithus are built in this version of the game even if they look compeltely different
---
This is the eariest alpha version available (0.5.3) from 2003.
---
Horde, so unless they add the Ravasaur equivalent this time, I won’t get the chance.
---
you the man taladril!
---
I prefer the midriff version pre legion
---
Ya that’s true. But the thing is I’m fine with other classes too lol like I wouldn’t mind being a shaman, hunter or warrior
---
I wouldn't mind a Classic museum.  I've been playing Vanilla for six years.
---
If I had any sign that they knew what they were doing, I might have hope for a vanilla-fied BC, which would change or remove the trivializing features of BC.  But I don't have hope.
---
I'm in the UK.
---
That would be all nice and dandy if phasing wasn't literally implemented through sharding and phasing also being commonly used colloquially to describe the user experience of having things pop in and out of existence that shouldn't in a seamless world.   
---
`"Sharding" is when different player characters are stuck in two incompatible **phases** and cannot see or interact with each other. This is indicated by a transparent portrait and an icon with a swirl pattern on it next to said portrait.`  
---
You are trying really hard to split hairs or miss the forest for the trees here.  
---
Layering as implemented (by their own description) and as experienced on the beta leads inevitably to the exact same user experience under specific circumstances.  
---
We should be discussing (and I've tried this both in OP and elsewhere) how the system can be improved so those downsides are diminished.
---
I thought the same thing lol
---
Yeah but if you have 5 layers for those zones 3000 cap a pop and then everyone crosses over to a zone with only one layer you are now trying to fit 15000 players in a cap of 3000, you're forced to kick 12000 of them out if the game.
---
Yes, I think the weapon speed (1.80 vs 2.20) could be a reason to consider one over the other, but besides Vael I never felt weapon speed matters a whole lot for tanking. In fact, from a purely defensive standpoint, a fast weapon will cause more parries overall, which leads to more damage taken. Especially with the confirmed higher parry chance.
---
Notably, CTS and Spineshatter have the same (slow!) attack speed of 2.60, so it is not the reason there at least.
---
Meh, I doubt it to be honest. Dude straight up said he’d rather watch servers die than potentially see someone zone out of existence for the several weeks layering will be active. People like that don’t like to budge on an issue and it was apparent when he decided to attack my hyperbolic example of population instead of engaging with the fact that all those other layers will also be densely populated. But whatever.
---
I’ll make my own damn group!!! Haha or blame my friend cuz he never plays healers or tanks
---
https://youtu.be/cmMHIZKyhBI the best video ever lol I used it back in the day
---
nothing quite says #nochanges like "not even the 'positive' changes"
---
Yeah if you're 100% duo leveling, and aren't married to priest, I'd recommend switching.
---
The other difficult part of warlock/priest is that they are both reliant on last hitting, with spirit tap for priests and imp. soul drain for locks. That'll significantly hurt your uptime and regen, but I've never done it so I might be undervaluing the savings from being duo. However, solo, those two abilities are *huge* parts of why both classes are such strong levelers.
---
Shaman or hunter would both be very strong pairs IMO.
---
How would you rate hunters in battlegrounds? I always hear really mixed opinions on how hunters are rated PvP wise.
---
Sorry for the perhaps dumb question buy stage 2 pre-raid is getting ready for molten core when we have access to dire maul?
---
Once the initial rush of classic dies off if layering stays it’ll ruin the game.  Farming will be too easy with layering
---
Gold farming especially
---
Huh, why are you responding to me? The guy I replied to was the one that wanted discussions that weren't his gone, not me.
---
Pretty rad dude! :)
---
Fortunately, you can do just that on a private server.
---
Exactly like Zeydon said, Nothing because druids in 1v1s should always be able to escape. Travel form is OP in wPVP If i even sense that i'm about to lose a fight i'm duecing out, getting out of combat and going in stealth. As far as Tips, Entangling roots is all you really need for this strat!
---
Thinking spirit would help me regen health during battle as a warrior
---
Quick, let's all freak out 3 months before release!
---
High crit in a fully set up situation.  Not impressive.  If he hit a crit like that in actual PvP, then it would be cool.  Everyone knows a 100 rage execute hits huge, but it isn't practical to ever do it.
---
I love these maps you're putting together. Hopefully blizz takes some inspiration from you!
---
Great work! The only thing is that perhaps you should have rune of the guard captain for hunters instead of hand of justice. I'm sure some rogues and warriors out there would be very upset with a hunter rolling on hand of justice lol

---
&gt; they'll be doing it in quest gear since thats basically what they'd be trying to do it
---
it's not hard to spam aoe BRD while leveling and that's where most of the pre raid bis come from.
---
I don't get, however why you are so gung-ho against private servers. If anything private servers are slightly harder than retail was, and if you can clear MC in sub 1hour with epic gear you can clear it just slower with a mix of blues and some greens
---
So what happens when there are 5k plus people online on the 15+ main server and you hit level 15? Do you just get disconnected and put into a queue?

Back in Vanilla, I cleared most of Naxx and used this build without any issues:

Never once had threat issues.
---
Yes it is.
---
Believe it or not, I actually tried to time my screenshots when the proc would happen, but it turned out quite difficult since it procs quite rarely and usually either me, the warlock or the yeti would be out of sync :/
---
Shaman's were used as mana batteries for priests from what I remember, so not having mana tide will hurt you in any serious guild. That said, getting to BWL as a casual wouldn't be that difficult so I imagine you'd be able to manage it with a more casual friendly and laid back guild.
---
Accurate.
---
If you want to be top-notch viable at end game PvP then raid gear is the answer. It takes even more time to achieve Rank 13 &amp; 14 in the honor system. However, Rank 10 gives a blue set that is half way decent and the reputation gear from the Battlegrounds has some good options as well.
---
If you're playing more casually then you can probably get by with the rank 10 &amp; rep gear with some dungeon items. If you have the time for raiding then you might as well take that option.
---
Could be your hardware specs, could be that you rarely play and they want a player like your's data.
---
Either way, enjoy it.
---
They better fix this layering bullshit first.
---
They are the Kings of AV. 
---
Best flag defenders in WSG, generally get relegated as a flag defender in AB. 
---
Overall they're one of the least gear dependant pvp characters and have a high skill cap. They're not going to crush an entire team like a warrior could, but overall they're very hard to kill and provide consistent dps with decent burst.
---
I'll take the queues and dead realms, thanks.
---
Your whole argument is based around financials and I have had people in this very post bash me for using that as an example for why they want layering. Maybe you should go enlighten those people because I agree with everything you are saying. I just don't like to bend over for blizzard.
---
That's not how it works - if this is still possible once the game goes live, commercial gold sellers will exploit it to the nth degree:

---
You don't have to have a guide if your not trying to lvl really really fast. Sometimes its fun to just take it slow and discover things together. 
---
No matter how guide-heavy or not you want to play, since your doing a lock+preist, finding out a good wand progression will be super important.
---
i'd actually thought that was the issue. and i kinda forgot that it doesnt proc every auto attack hehe
---
&gt; most people are just yelling about how terrible layering
---
&gt; echo chamber of angry sentiment is hardly discussion
---
uh? I replied to that. Im saying thats how forum works and doesnt invalidate the post. 
---
Youre saying it inst a discussion because the angry people, and im saying every forum ever is like this.
---
It was funny as hell as it was when I was an experienced raider with my hunter (tier 2 Armor) and I was helping the alt raid for them to gear up. 
---
I sneezed and clicked my pet attack macro and didn’t notice while I went to get a tissue and came back to a 80% wiped raid and people who were left running in chaos as 30 plus mobs were running about. 
---
I dealt with them teasing me for like 2 months straight for that huntard move
---
Found the guy who didn’t get invited.
---
No they are not the same.
---
I had one with my guild name on it. Victorious Secret. Couldn't exactly wear that around my Middle School, lol
---
Kinda reminds me of the Ooga Bruddahs but oppositely  they want to play with streamers...to kill them...
---
know idea why I did this. I guess I was just bored.
---
Right but who is anyone commenting here to say that there are or aren't words from the high ups there on what should and shouldn't happen.
---
Lolwut
---
I think the logistics of this zone would be quite a pain, with how long it stretches. But it sure seems fun too.
---
Being so close to the Dark Portal, I'd think some Burning Legion/demon dimension to it could really be quite cool though. STV with demons basically, sign me up 😂
---
This right here. 100% agree.
---
Hmm 🤔
---
As alliance he never gave me a quest
---
If you're looking to offtank, then you should have no trouble finding a raid spot. Warriors may be overplayed, true, but many of them go just to dps, and on the servers i've played, tanks are always in high demand.
---
If this is your first time playing vanilla in a few years, I wouldn't knock the mage idea. Mages are a huge step up from warriors in terms of leveling speed and QoL (free food, drinks, portals, easier farming)
---
All in all, don't pick your class based on what you think other people are going to be playing. These coming classic servers are projected to be huge, plenty of guilds to go around.
---
You hopped dimensions but your griffon stayed.
---
bro where the enhance shammy love @
---
Holy shit.
---
This is awesome. I can't imagine how much work must have gone into this.
---
This list sucks. Mage is so scuffed at every phase. Google infra's sheet
---
Flight paths are like Pokemon.  Gotta catch'm all.
---
To late, they already paid for the domain.
---
So how is someone saying this will probably be fine an invalid thought that should never be talked about? Dissenting opinions makes for discussion.
---
I liked Desolace because it was far less ganky than STV, but I certainly agree with the amount of travel you have to do for all the centaur and turn in quests.
---
The original reason they gave in the Cata beta was that the entry into Deepholm didn't feel epic enough, so they changed the location entirely
---
I mean that’s the reason all the streamers went to SM to level 30-40. Even at those levels trying to quest with everyone else is not good.
---
Yep. Even without it being subjective, BiS varies by boss and raid comp, too.
---
If you've played since vanilla you've giben them more than a few hundred dollars.
---
What if it wasn't Pirates but Defias instead. Seeing as they have overrun Westfall, it makes sense that they have another base not too far away especially as they also have influence in Elwynn. 
---
Just spit-balling here but it would also be cool for them to have their own haven/minor settlement which you could rep grind on Horde to become allies with (perhaps they start as Hostile or Neutral but could be open to persuasion like Timbermaw Hold).

It could also serve as the base for instances or more (Deadmines style 25-man anyone?) Which you could fight your way into or have positively repped Characters smuggle a party into. With new content like this comes new opportunities for game play styles that don't deviate too far from the traditional models.
---
Nah, let's have blind faith in Blizzard instead, they would *never* let a scuffed beta project make it to live servers.

**Flameweave Cuffs** are far worse than Tearfall bracers no?
---
\- The Bracers are off a rare that spawns very close tho the front, you can nearly always just /tar to see if it is there, these are not hard to get. Getting the random enchant, makes this tougher but, the flamecuffs are in the same situation with that.
---
**Atal'ai Gloves** are worse then [\[Hands of Power\]](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Hands_of_Power) too.
---
\-The gloves are much easier to get, better, and they do not have a random enchant.
---
2 repeatable quests, one is collecting meat from chimeras and bears with a lame drop chance. And a quest killing furblogs. These quests each give 50 or 75 rep each. I think 50.
---
Wut? Um done talking to a door. Bye
---
...and that's just your hunch?
---
Pple still waiting for an invite? Just canceled my sub. Dont give a fck anymore.
---
BGs were cross realm by end of Vanilla weren't they? I hope they turn it off personally but i believe it was there.
---
hmm might be right about that, but if I have to forget about thunderfury i might roll a rouge instead
---
decisions decisions
---
but thanks for your reply
---
Warfronts are PvP? If they were, I'd actually do them.
---
And as I said, I got every type of elite armor this season and leather set looks also terrible. Got it on my Zandalari rogue, and it looks bad in my opinion, so generic as rest of them. That warfront set looks also pretty bland.
---
If you like it, it's fine. But there are people who also liked Uldir sets, so there's that.
---
I mean really, because there's nothing interesting to do in BfA right now as 416 ilvl if I don't do mythic raids, I just farm old content. Literally everything looks better than BfA sets, but that's just my opinion. As DK main, plate armor sets in BfA look so bad. Legion had much better looking sets and they still had class sets.
---
&gt;If they're doing it for money, they're doing it wrong.
---
No... If you make something that needs no maintenance and continues to make you money where you didn't make money before then they are doing it right in a financial sense.
---
Yea totally. Many of the streamers and beta people will totally quit classic and go to retail over one battleground 
---
Serious dude?
---
yoink
---
And 2 (at least so far, still looking....) of them are worse than alternatives (pre-bis)
---
if the opinions of internet people is scary to you the  you're already a fool
---
Is my first time playing classic in general. I am pretty sure I will go warrior and roll a mage later on if I feel like leveling another character, since I have read that Warriors are really gear dependent and I would like to get that character geared asap so I do not fall behind too hard ( since the leveling will take me forever, not only for ingame reasons but got some major exams coming up a month or so after classic release ).
---
This guy . . . Is not my type of guy ..
---
It's an excavation site in searing gorge. Not a place you want to be dropped at level 40.
---
Blizzard isn't just going to have the game be a complete mess if they can help it. We're talking about potentially millions of people playing in the 1st few days/weeks. When that happened on WoW's actual launch, there were dozens and dozens of servers to spread out the population. They can't have dozens of servers with Classic, the long-term player base won't be large enough to support them. This is why they are doing layering to begin with, so they can keep the amount of servers low. 
---
Even if the servers themselves were stable, it isn't an experience that Blizzard wants to put out in their product and force players into. Just because a small amount of people are okay with it doesn't make it the right choice. Most people absolutely wouldn't have fun when they can't even quest or find mobs to kill because there are hundreds of people around.
---
nice post thanks for sharing
---
And nobody covets these supposed login mounts. Much like nobody coveted the basic mounts back in the day. Rare drops are just as coveted now as they were back then.
---
Used to bot fish too. My roommate and I wrote our own bot, but never left it unattended for fear of getting caught. Not sure I'd be willing to risk my entire b.net account now though.
---
Is this just going to be for locations that are visible on the zone map? For instance, [Dustwind Cave](https://i.imgur.com/x5V1zrK.png) isn't visible
---
Just stop dude only like 2 and a half months until you don’t care about the beta anyway.
---
Nope, and I'm going Horde this time do I won't even be tempted.
---
I HATE THEM!
---
&gt;Yeah but if you have 5 layers for those zones 3000 cap a pop and then everyone crosses over to a zone with only one layer you are now trying to fit 15000 players in a cap of 3000, you're forced to kick 12000 of them out if the game.
---
Servers have a cap and the layers are **already** planned to not be permanent, so the server population will be merged at one point or another. OP is suggesting doing it after a few zones rather than into late game.
---
Overpopulation as a server wide issue cannot and is not be solved by layering because layering is temporary anyway. The purpose of layering is to deal with short term **local** overpopulation confined to things like starting zones and the barrens etc. "Moving the bottleneck" is something you're right about, the neck would be moved but the amount flowing through the neck would also be different depending on where you place it and when.
---
Lol get fucking wrecked. Have fun waiting until August 27th and not be able to log in for 3 hours after launch while you watch sodapoppin already level 6
---
Just falling into a pit full of chain pulls and only two very inconvenient ramps out
---
Awesome thank you ill give him a look
---
The key is to get the kid to grind for you. That's what my best friend used to do, he'd set his little brother a task and the kid would happily grind for hours on end.
---
Millions?.. Like really? Have you seen what classic is looking like currently? I would be shocked if they put more than 500K into the re-development of it honestly.
---
Or maybe it’s not working as intended. Aka a bug. Aka the whole reason for the beta.
---
10 bucks says you're from the US.

Well, and successfully clearing said boss.

A lot of games force people together from same areas because it reduces ping between them.

yup /u/snapunhappy is one of the pro-layering folks

Damn thank you for posting this! Haven't see this in about 10 minutes! Thank you, thank you!
---
Logs in everyday to tell trade chat that the game is dead
---
You're literally just doing exactly what I said earlier. You don't want to discuss something you don't agree with so you're ignoring it.
---
A bunch of people agreeing about something is not a discussion, it's a conversation. Someone bringing in a different thought is a discussion. I understand how Reddit works with echo Chambers. Doesn't mean that's a reason to exclude any other opinion.
---
Georgetown? Something very similar happened to me in an Age of Mythology online game back in the day
---
Edit: if it is Georgetown and the 92 in your name is your birth year we may know each other haha
---
This is where a debuff like curse of recklessness comes in. Prevents the hunter from being feared.
---
I helped a few hunters with this chain. None of them were killed because of it.
---
There is a middle ground in there somewhere. You'll find it. Most of us are there!
---
I used that number because that's what everyone is throwing out. I also wanted a worst case scenario as an example. As for the dropoff, phase 1 is supposed to last 6-8 months. So after 8 months, sure, I think anyone would expect drop off. Is layering a server so you don't have to merge after 8 months worth it? No I don't think so.
---
I get what you are saying I just don't agree that we should bend over and accept layering because it's the only option.
---
Thank you i will check out Toez1
---
Considering OP was alluding to TW: 3k being the most highly anticipated game of 2019, can I ask you if TW: Warhammer 1 &amp; 2 were the most highly anticipated games for their respective years? No and not even close. Doesn’t mean they didn’t do well for the franchise, but not top 3 games sold for their year (or even top 3 anticipated)
---
I personally loved TW: Warhammer series, but let’s not act like they were highly anticipated in gaming as a whole which is what we were originally talking about. Warhammer did well, but 3k was coined to be “next gen” of the Total War series. Still the best selling for the franchise but for reasons I explained above.
---
My suggestions for resolving the complaints with Layering, if possible and based on my understanding of the process. 
---
_World-wide Behavior_
---
World buffs and fishing competitions are realm-wide and transcend Layers. 
---
_Layer-wide Behavior_
---
-Layer 1 fills to Threshold C (buffer remains for party transfers in), then Layer 2 begins filling
---
-Layer 1 empties some, Layer 2 continues filling until it reaches Minimum Threshold A
---
-Layer 1 begins filling again until Threshold C
---
-If Layer 1 has space while actively filling, check Layer 2
---
-If Layer 2 is below Threshold B (less than Threshold A) and Layer 1 has remaining space of Layer 2's population + X, then collapse Layer 2 into Layer 1 after a warning: 30 seconds until your Layer merges into another / 30 seconds until another Layer merges into yours
---
_Player Specific Behavior_
---
-Players are generally locked into Layer upon entry to server (EK or Kalimdor)
---
Transferring Layers follows the priority system below:
---
-If someone groups, transfer layers only if they are in or enter a rested area. Transfer to the group leader's layer. 
---
-When accepting an invite outside a rested area, pop up: "Your group leader is in another layer. Enter a rested area to join their layer and play with them!"
---
-If a Layer is full when someone would enter based on party then transfer them to an available server and pop up: "The Layer your group is on is full. Your position in the queue is X. You will be transferred as soon as space becomes available even if outside a rest area."
---
-Anyone taking the same portal goes to the same Layer (redundant, should follow the general group rules anyway but! Hypothetical: Player A is the leader, Player B is not. Player B enters portal from EK to Kalimdor and Player A follows, then Player A should first attempt to enter the same Layer as Player B.)
---
-Anyone taking the same ship/zeppelin goes to the same Layer after first assigning based on group affiliation.
---
7 year old account. 2 comments. Not much to see from that guy haha.
---
Why would you have ever come to that conclusion? They literally never said that just people on here were saying that to try and get more people accepting of layering / sharding.

I agree with you in some ways, but it is what it is man
---
"These streamers don't do shit, they're just there for publicity. "
---
exactly. their role isn't to beta test. a lot of them never played vanilla. there are around 2-3k people in the beta and maybe 30 streamers. they make up a very small population of the beta. vanilla peaked at around 7.5 million subscribers. not everyone who played vanilla is going to get in.
---
Nice one
---
It’s amazing and a ton of fun. There’s a lot to learn to truly be the most impactful shaman as this spec. You will need to manage ur global cooldowns effectively and use proper spells at the right time. It is a very strong spec and shines well in group pvp, but also can really hold its own when played at a high level. 
---
If you find a fourth friend make sure he is a priest, because dispelling magic will be huge for your melee friends as well as yourself when a mage gets a sheep off on you. You would be a very strong pvp squad with a priest and a mage imo. 
---
Go enhancement 1h shield if solo, if you’re going to be leveling with friends 90% of the time, then you can do 2h enhance if that seems more fun, but any spec will really do. If you’re interested in being elemental asap then you can make the switch as early as level 39 to make it viable, but you’ll need to get mage water before ur leveling sessions Bc ull kill things fast. If ur leveling with the warrior and rogue, ur just gonna be dropping totems for them and healing them up since they can go ham on mobs with no downtime if they’re getting consistently healed. So resto can even be pretty good for talents as well.
---
Better yet no layers all together. Why not just expand the area size to deal with more players?
---
Yeah, you were totally advocating for the middle ground and not the opposite extreme.
---
Beta testing is not for testing, but for advertising. Yes its stupid and unfair
---
How is it you've just now come to realize that life is not fair?
---
How high is too high?
---
That's how it happened because that's how it was designed. It's the opposite of instant gratification. If you plan for longevity, you have to include long term goals for players to work towards. They don't just pick numbers out of a hat when designing quests, and one with such a significant reward would be even more calculated than the rest.
---
But you had to sign up for it specifically...so you are either lying to start a circle jerk or you specifically said you wanted to play the beta...
---
&gt; Yeah, because that's what everyone wants to see, players vanishing in major cities like SW and Org!
---
People already do that when they log out/BG queues pop(when BGs are out)/get summoned.
---
You also didn't play with mongoloids like people dps like now where threat will be a real issue. The more threat you do the more dps your raid can do. That might work for you but as i said for cutting edge guilds Deep prot wont cut it until t3 gear.
---
Your missing the point I'm not saying I'm entitled to it you keep using that word, but I haven't used it. I'm saying that without a subscription I'm deprived of it. That means I'm paying for it indirectly which is still paying for it. Not that my payment entitles me to beta access. Do you not see the difference between those 2 things?
---
I'm not saying they owe it to me to keep the beta online. I'm saying I have a right to be irritated as it's a fringe benefit of my specific subscription which I pay for. I also have a right to be irritated, as we're essentially doing work for them for free. Granted that work is fun, but the moment it's not fun I might stop doing it, and others may as well.
---
They have an interest in keeping the experience as fun as possible, so we continue to help them collect metrics and report bugs.
---
Just what i was looking for, thanks a ton- book marking for later
---
Honestly just give us dynamic spawn
---
If blizz would have just merged the low pop servers with launch servers retail would have had a better pop from mists forward.
---
This is what's supposed to happen, or close to it (they shouldn't have had to remake the group).
---
The intended functionality is you'll be sent to your group leader's layer so you can play together.
---
They don't want to permanently segregate friends/guilds for the period layering is enabled.
---
Seems like you're unaware the system is meant to be present, also that it isn't sharding, and also that it's going to be temporary. Only for the first few weeks of launch, to deal with the launch surge.
---
That's what i am saying HOTW is such a good item. It lasts your 5 fucking ever.
---
Yeah, it's not consistent.  Eskander's is down as bis for MC tier, which makes me think they are prioritising fast weapons.  (fwiw, I think that Eskander's is a fantastic tank weapon because no one else wants it).
---
I should note that I've never raided as a warrior, so I am just going by what tanks have told me, particularly back on retail vanilla when all the damage values were the same.  Our tanks swore by fast weapons for rage dumping.
---
**If** fast weapons are better, then with what I know now, guild crafting a couple of blackguards early on might be a good move.  If they're not bis for bwl tier then they are damn close, and it's not competing with drops for dps.
---
&gt; My paladin used to receive whispers all the time on how Ret is the worst DPS.
---
So true. Every time I took a 2h weapon in my hands, people start emoting and whispering me with insults. I was rather young and naive, so I didn't even block them.
---
Some form of layering has been active since beta started. Only since yesterday's patch in preparation for AV testing have people been seeing the bugs as severely as they are now.
---
Gizlock's Hypertech Buckler should probably be considered for pre-raid BiS for Resto Shaman in both P1 and P2.
---
Funnily enough it's precisely all the walking that really drives home that this place is truly remote and desolate.
---
It's one of my favorite areas in the game.
---
How much money do you think streamers have made blizzard? More or less than you?
---
If you're going to be pedantic and an ass about it, how about explaining it for everyone instead?
---
don't feed the trolls people.
---
quick somebody call the **wambulance**!!
---
Not going to assume what op meant, going from the text.
---
Also hard to argue when I qouted him 2x saying such.
---
Thanks for pointing that one out. We expected that there would be a few that were overlooked. This and any others will get pushed out and updated. Keep looking for missing key areas. The only things we aren't probably going to do would be lone buildings with no map marker at all, but everything else is fair game.
---
And a massive subscription cancellation.
---
Are you new to Blizzard? People have been saying "relax, it's only beta" for *years*, and it almost always goes live.
---
&gt;  The entire beta is probably just a marketing tactic in order to draw in more customers via twitch. 
---
Ding ding ding!
---
Well there's not a chance in hell that we don't have some form of layering/sharding regardless of if everyone says they want that so it's more about thinking up ideas to handle population flood in better or different ways.
---
so... I guess have fun not playing classic...
---
YES!!!!! Had it on live and will again.  So worth it. Plus we don't know when or it Classic will go beyond 1.12.  I will have my favorite Vanilla mount!
---
She’s hot
---
At the end of the day, the same thing is happening from the player's perspective.  What is happening is a distinction without a difference.  You are arguing over the why, which doesn't matter.
---
So it can be tested.
---
&gt;I'll be sure to remember this when the game actually does launch.
---
Be sure to update us on how that goes. We'll even make a witty hashtag for you.
---
Ok so offer both experiances? Layered servers for the new people and normal servers for the old lot. Have the layered ones marked as "new players" like how they have it now so timmy who logs in to try it out wont get mixed up with what server to pick.
---
You dont want no part of this Dewey.
---
Flavor and atmosphere wise, the undead starting route imo is one of the best. It could easily be made into a standalone game.
---
Thank God for this beta. Now they can fix it before launch with testing.
---
If I can find the time, for sure. I used to wake up before work and grind out a bit of this at idiot o'clock in the morning before I had to leave the house at 5:30am... I liked the nice peaceful feeling of it.
---
Casting hots on yourself before the pull, using Thorns, and tab + Swipe is plenty of AoE threat. Add Maul if you have enough rage. Threat shouldn't be an issue for Druids.
---
Against things that aren't raid bosses: Barkskin + Hurricane is far and away the best threat. That said give your healer a heads up before you do this. Your health pool is a lot smaller in caster form than it is in bear form and you can't dodge while channeling (though your overall damage mitigation is pretty similar).
---
You're not a "just chatting"-tiddygirl on twitch so you're definitely not the last person....
---
Admitting you're not an MMORPG player. 😋
---
Did it in classic but this time for the horde!!
---
People are doing that over getting ganked
---
Actually you kinda have to, otherwise you are assuming.
---
The days of trolling with this retarded argument is over. We have proven that Vanilla is the superior version of the game by far.
---
Yes! We will continue to add to this over time. The sky is the limit.
---
Hopefully phase 1 doesn't last too long, as I know we haven't heard anything about it yet. Like, if I can level 1-60 in phase 1, that's gonna be a lot of missed experiences/immersion breaks due to layering.
---
If a server can't settle (either due to tourists sticking around for longer than anticipated or streamer servers), I don't think a server split would be viable especially if a person wants to play with a streamer. It might just be best to offer free server transfers and let people know that that server will just super busy and have queue times consistently and constantly.
---
i hate you lol.. the truth hurts
---
yeah. i had huge respect for those who had it. i usually even whispered them nice mount or marry me plz
---
* low droprate items in dungeon/raid are ignored (legendaries, ironfoe, ...)
---
* green random item are ignored (like wand +X spell domage, ...)
---
But why not? Seems natural to fit them in somewhere, especially something like Ironfoe/Felstriker, or a + Frost Damage/Healing wand.
---
? It doesn’t work at all in bgs
---
only thing that matters here is he is a NE again, as he always should have been.
---
Epic and doesn't require epic riding training.
---
I don't think they will do that because the zones will be too populated at that level... also where is the "cutoff" the barrens is level 11-high20s
---
And other zones have random level starts/ends
---
100% move speed. Arguably the most epic of mounts in vanilla, aside from Baron rivendare's.
---
I thought there were battlegroups. As in you could face people from other servers, but it was always the same 3-4 servers in your battlegroup. So at least you'd start to recognize some names.
---
I don't want to one up, lol. But in retail during the launch of WoD I quested a bit with this druid and we got to talking and it ended up that he literally lived 5 minutes from my house. It's the closest I've ever had a stranger live near me that I've found on the internet.
---
The whole point of layering is to have less servers. The long term classic population won't be able to support extra servers.
---
Druid ftw
---
🤮🤮🤮🤮
---
Male Orc Shaman
---
Male Orc Warlock
---
Female Tauren Druid
---
Male Troll Priest
---
Male Tauren Hunter
---
Male Troll Rogue
---
Male Orc Warrior
---
It has never been anything else. The only thing that indicated that it was something else is the devs saying so.
---
Ahh a camped Horde!
---
nice bait
---
Well that was an experience haha, thanks man
---
Yeah. Booo. It’s not like you pay them 15$ a month just to log in. Poor sods.
---
Not in the same way though. They may be coveted because you get to say you have a 'rare' mount in your collection. But there's over 400 mounts in the game now. Nobody else gives a shit if you have a 'rare' one because they have a couple 'rare' ones too. If everyone has a rare mount, in reality, no one does.
---
PJSalt
---
dynamic respawns
---
Millions of players played during vanilla. The beta has a population of thousands. That math alone should give you a hint about how low the chances are to get an invite.
---
Damnit i didn’t know that
---
please be a troll. and if not, I’m glad you aren’t in :) keep bitching
---
Well realize there is no pvp set until phase 3, but the pieces you can get from the hunter dungeon set+random side pieces will be basically on par with the blue pvp set.  If you can get into a MC raid early you will eventually get the rhokdelar bow and get some of the raid set that is strictly better then the pvp blue set.  
---
Part of why hunters start out so strong is their gear is just perfectly made from the beginning for their class.  Other specs have to wait for a raid tier or 2 until they can itemize properly.  
---
So if ele and hunter is equal in your brain, id go hunter first
---
If resto and hunter are equal, Id go shaman first
---
If you are looking at an alt in phase 2 or 3, ele might then be equal to or better then hunter(for pvp) since by then it can somewhat be geared properly if you are raiding BWL.
---
oh my god yes, and didn't it only drop from certain satyrs?
---
Of course, only reason I'd roll Alliance to be honest. Debating rolling Human just to make it a little quicker, but Gnome master race is calling me.
---
What was it in WOTLK? Because that's when I got mine and I'm certain it didn't take that long. Took awhile, but not half a year.
---
It is hilarious that you think every raid guild is going to be cutting edge and tryhard. Get over yourself.
---
Wish I'd never turned that quest back in Vanilla +
---
Hell yea
---
my bot will do it
---
So the first week is a shit show. It's better than the game being shit.
---
UK Only.
---
"The entire beta is probably just a marketing tactic in order to draw in more customers via twitch."
---
Yes, precisely. Why is this so fucking hard for people to understand? Blizzard is a business, primarily concerned with financial success. They don't owe you beta, and the very fact that you're frothing at the mouth to get playing is good evidence that their hype machine is working as intended.
---
Who cares about a huge crit on execute when it can only be used when a player has 20% or less health lol. 1k would’ve had the same outcome. Shit I bet 600 would’ve too.
---
So not sure if this is normal but the site comes up blocked on high security networks because the site has malware and key logging.... just a warning.
---
You are not special. You are owed nothing. At all. Ever.
---
not slow and pointless! good grey vendor stuff and experience! Plus it was so open and made for wonderful pvp experiences :/
---
It's heavy testing of layering, by forcing multiple layers on a beta server than don't even have enough people for one layer.
---
Nothing out of the ordinary.
---
For the beta under 3k server population, 8-10 layers is basically SHARDING.
---
Could be that Blizzard is testing even more than 10 layers.
---
Nothing to be alarmed off.
---
This started yesterday...because it was implemented YESTERDAY.
---
Ask yourself...was this an issue 2 days ago? Or a week ago?
---
Nope...so yeah, this is a basically a STRESS TEST for layering.
---
I can't have those as reference...the Classic team is the Classic team.
---
They were basically the opposite of BfA team, in ALL aspects.
---
\-Loot trading from Retail-like to raids only and drastically limited
---
\-Phases from 4 to 6
---
\-right-click report being assessed by a PERSON, not kicking in automatically
---
\-Layering vs sharding
---
\-Spell batching
---
\-progressive itemization
---
\-stupidly often blue posts and actually talking and listening to the Classic community feedback
---
I am sorry, but I just CAN'T put the Classic team in same category with retail team.
---
Alliance not having Stormwind Harbor in Vanilla or easy access to Kalimdor is hands down one of my biggest pet peeves
---
I was planning on posting this evening, when is your shift?
---
What as rough about it? Other than the tons of horde on a PvP server and level 60s camping every earth elemental making it hard to complete your quests.
---
Off the top of my head there's at least 10-15 quests to do around the late-30s early-40s range. I usually hit level 40 in Badlands on most of my Alliance characters.
---
i will just wait and buy it or something in a cooler color on the cash shop for ten bucks in a few months
---
i could just picture this place being such a gank fest.

---
I’m right there with ya, these guild ones were purchased directly through blizzard. I wish I could still fit in it.
---
My point was not about the job. Sorry if it came out that way. Hes making money on fan boys giving him thier earnd cash. People should not Think hes a God in the game. Hes just a player like us. He has no power over the game. 
---
Sorry for the bad english.

LIVE TO WIN
---
During TBC, my sister's school had a snow day, and she was online playing WoW, chatting with her guild. After some discussion, it turned out a guildmate was actually her classmate. :) A fun coincidence, but it wasn't that wild; the server was EST time zone, after all, and they were both playing because school had been cancelled for the day.
---
But still, a lot of fun! You don't see it happen too often these days.
---
That sounds like my high school fantasy
---
I've somewhat considered seeing if a small group of 5-10 people are interested in doing this frequently. With the idea that once one gets it, they continue to help until the others get, reducing the number of people rolling each time.
---
There are no issues with not layering. Huge private servers played just fine.
---
Awesome! Keep it up! :D
---
Standing around and waiting for something to spawn so you can MAYBE tag it is not fun. Anyone who's leveled on the launch of a private server will tell you that it's absolutely miserable. It's not wacky fun where people find how to somehow level despite every mob and quest objective being dead, it's just a huge shitshow where 90% of your time will spent camping things.
---
If Servers are US West as norm, it's only gonna be 180-210 for me in Melb. I can live with that for PvE. Back in old days it used to be 270-350 and inconsistent PL lol.
---
Yep, good ol' STVietnam.
---
Like you cant use the ability? I dont have beta access, but I know there is a chance of it being resisted and therefore doing nothing...But obviously it shouldnt happen every time...
---
The glory of a rogue is I don’t need to rush max level. I just need to be higher level or equal to the people in the zone with me! Invis life
---
I have been back and forth on playing WoW ever since WotLK. My first main was a Druid and I absolutely loved him, the versatility to do next to any role and the mobility. I then stopped playing came back on MoP and played Monk for a month which was also fun for the same reasons but with more viability. Finally coming back during BFA and playing an outlaw rogue where I got to be pure dps with some good mobility via grappling hook.
---
Now classic is coming out and I am more excited then ever to no-life this game. I already have requested off the first 3 days of it being out for work as well as the day a couple weeks early to reserve my character names.
---
I am stuck on what to choose class wise. With three options at hand. Warrior, Rogue, or Druid. I have always been a player who loves dealing damage while still having the survivability  to outplay my opponent. I will be playing PvE to gear up and when needed for the content/experience but PvP is what I love the most. Being able to outplay/out think my opponent is where I thrive.
---
Druid was my go to but from the sounds of it they are a below average jack-of-all-trades and can't do any one thing too well.
---
Rogues will deal some of the best damage but I fear the ability to get into groups with the sheer amount of rogues that will be around as well as having a lot less mobility than I am use to in a Rogue.
---
Warriors really stand out in my selection. For the past month I have been playing a Warrior on a pserver planning on going any of the three specs with Arms being my current ambition. I am not afraid to be thrown onto Prot Warrior and learning how to tank to get the experience. I am okay with the trade-off of mobility for survivability with going the warrior class as well. 
---
What do you think? Am I right in some of my assumptions?
---
yep, you aren't getting close to exalted by 60, never mind 40.  my human doing pretty much all of the human zones up to 40 is barely into revered with stormwind so there's no chance for anyone to get a cross race mount without cloth turn ins.  
---
like you said, pserver values are inflated up the ass.  i have a fresh 60 night elf that i tried to do as many quest as possible before they turned grey and it's exalted darn, SW, and 18/21 ironforge, 9/21 gnomeregan.  i also have a 70 on a tbc realm that's exalted with every single alliance rep just from questing so there is some difference but i have no idea what pserver values are derived from.

if a group of football players are meeting on the field, they're probably talking about football. if a group of archaeologists meet at a dig site, they're probably talking about archaeology. if a group of businessmen are meeting in a boardroom, they're probably talking about how to make business AKA money.  
---
You don't have to be a telepath or a genius to know this.
---
Going the hellscream-1 hellscream-2  and then merge after a month route is the best idea I have seen yet. Far better then layering.
---
What streamer quit beta because they got ganked?
---
TBH, I can't tell what's rare anymore. There are so so so many re-skins that they all look equally difficult to get even if I know they are not.
---
have sex
---
You’re fucking awful and people like you will probably defend them when they add the cash shop too. 15k pop was amazingly fun they had other solutions like dynamic respawns.
---
nice job man.
---
Sadly that's just what happens to the game when you have like 8 expansion packs now.
---
There's such a huge amount of content that if a new player had to start fresh and play through every expansion's content, it would take them ages just to reach the most recent stuff.
---
Retail WoW only cares about the newest patch/raid/content, everything before it becomes irrelevant real fast.
---
Whatever makes you inner private player happy.
---
So did they just name sharding "layering" so they can say "Oh see guys classic doesn't have sharding, don't worry :\^)))))"
---
It's about the server though, they have said it themselves. And also the launch day is part of the experience and yes I want to see that shitshow not a singe playerish game.
---
Don't feed the troll, it's a 4 days old account with 0 karma, obviously a throwaway account created with the sole purpose of trolling.
---
What a fucking baby
---
You think I spend all my time watching all of them? There are videos every so often with people finding classic too hard or getting banked or something, seriously get a life and stop adding to negatively voted comments
---
Your druid phase 3 set needs a 3rd piece of stormrage for the set bonus.  Some set bonuses are too important to ignore.
---
The classic grind also has a chance to drop rare world drops which definitely help to keep it interesting.
---
Blizzard has data on player retention across all expansions it's not the responsibility of reddit posters to work it out. They're a billion dollar company.
---
It was a thing with Monkeynews’ node mining a few weeks ago, but everyone just downvoted any and every post or comment about it being alarming.
---
I've decided to get Exalted to Timbermaw hold while leveling to 60. Two birds one stone. As horde, I won't be able to do this grind.
---
Maybe Rivendaire mount will drop? /shrug
---
Or they could just use layering when it's necessary and phase it out... like what they're planning on doing...
---
Layering is a temporary solution to a very real, but temporary problem. It's not a permanent game mechanic. Anyone here who knows anything about Blizzard knows that they absolutely aren't just going to let the game be a mess on launch if they can avoid it. The overreaction is this thread to a beta issue is ridiculous.
---
Thank you all for responding!
---
You didn't get in because they wanted people like [this](https://streamable.com/gxnut) in the beta instead.
---
Just kidding. I just thought it might piss you off more though.
---
 * 1 minute intro with terrible music
---
 * 1 minute of general rambling
---
 * 1 minute outline of what this current video will be about
---
 * 1 minute of thanking subscribers, reminding to subscribe
---
 * 1 minute of talking about other videos that are going to come out soon
---
 * 7 seconds of saying "Voice chat is working in Beta"
---
 * 5 minutes of talking about how voice chat didn't exist in Vanilla, and no mention of why it is a bad thing that it is in Classic.
---
This is a very good point. Outside of maybe a transmog item, unlocking allied races offers nothing extra.
---
Motherfucking BC release night. Half the time I'd get kicked out and have to wait to log back in, finally log back in, and I had less progress on my quest than before. Sitting in Hellfire trying to tag a mob while 100+ players just spammed AOE over the location.
---
It was silly and fun for the first five minutes, then I just wanted to play.
---
Cause getting to 60 asap is important
---
Whats so good about Nazjak?
---
I’d say it’s pretty practical if the opportunity presents itself for whatever reason.
---
Big support for this
---
Lol okay, so based on how much I can actually play I should have this by may or 2020 xD
---
You are right tho a 20mill rc grind in osrs is probably comparable with this. Atleast before all the new stuff was added to osrs I havnt played that game for a few years now. I only really liked the game before AH was added
---
absolutely love these. always bothered me that some zones just had nothing in them. higher level STV? sign me up
---
What? You said people are quitting yet have no proof to back it up? Where are these videos you keep bringing up?
---
I love stuff like this. I hope classic wow gets enough players to keep bliz expanding on the classic world; new zones, new quests, new dungeons, maybe even an xpac that is divergent from the current xpac timelines
---
Yeah because Chinese farming is the same as blizzard doing it. If it's the same, pretty sure it will be available this time. Go back to retail if you want blizzard handling to you everything just because you have no time to play.
---
You're in the denial/bargaining phase of grief
---
I think it's possible that they never get layering work properly. If they really have technical challenges with it they might just think that let it be like this because it will be gone soon anyway.
---
I think they could just make layering to be on low level zones at launch. After all when time goes on people start to be quite scattered. Layering was made so level 1 players can enjoy launch. It doesn't need to exists in higher level zones because there won't be 100 000 players hitting level 60 at same exact moment.
---
My solution would be just to add like 5 (numbers completely random) layers at 1-10 zones, 4 to 10-20, 2 for 20-30 zones and after level 40 everything happens on one layer (aka one server). This way we can avoid need to camp early level quests but no one can actually take advantage of layering to farm devilsaur or black lotuses which seems to concern a lot of people.
---
Dungeons give little XP compared to just questing or grinding in the outside world. And that's even when you factor in the XP for doing dungeon quests (which you would have to gather in the outside world anyways).
---
In Vanilla *a lot* of time goes into assembling a group and waiting for everyone to arrive. So unless you have a premade group at the ready, your actual leveling speed goes down even more. Prepare to spend a lot of time. But hey, if that's fun to you, go for it.
---
Red is dead. Gray is prey. Am I right?!😁

Drops tidal charm, a trinket which is a 3 second 30 yard range stun.

I feel you man..

I am so unbelievably sad and angry at the same time
---

---
How can it be achieved easier on a single server?
---
this is an important point.
---
"It was happening to him all day" = "He was intentionally trying to swap layers all day"
---
It didn't just *happen* to him unintentionally.
---
that simple horse looks cooler than all the crazy retail mounts combined
---
It would also crash the servers.
---
For 1200 WoW coins on the Classic Store you can buy the pitchfork emote.  Act now and get 2000 WoW coins for 19.99 which is normally 24.99.  
---
It's OK though because you can earn WoW coins in game by just playing the game.  You can unlock a limit of 50 WoW coins per day unless you upgrade a premium WoW account which allows you to earn up to 100 coins per day.  
---
Order the WoW booster pack for 19.99 now and get 500 free coins.
---
I have big doubts that classic will ever advance to the pre TBC patch stage. It will likely stop at naxx for good and if they want to release new content it will be something unrelated to the already implemented classic servers
---
Classic!
---
Maybe Bloodhoof was just an older server when BC dropped but I remember that shit crashing constantly that night. I laughed in Vent for the first five minutes and then I was just annoyed because I really wanted to play
---
It's what stopped me from continuing to 60 after hitting the late 40's (on a pserver). Like those last 10 levels are huge in terms of xp per level and while I did make it to 55 in vanilla wow, I do not remember, nor have I experienced some of the 50's questing zones like EPL/WPL, Winterspring, Blasted Lands, Searing Gorge or Silithus. Also the endgame dungeons/raids.
---
Pservers were initially so I could get myself comfortable healing in those endgame dungeons/raids but I realized I'd rather just have a totally 100% fresh experience with a classic release :).

the event im referring to was during the second stress test, when literally thousands of people rolled lvl 1 characters and tried to converge for a huge pvp battle in hillsbrad.  it seems highly unlikely that there were hundreds, maybe thousands, of ally grouped up, but all the horde on the same layer just happened to be 'elsewhere' doing other stuff...and the same thing was happening on a different layer, with all the horde grouped and alliance off doing other things. yeah, sounds reasonable.
---
My suggestions for resolving the complaints with Layering, if possible and based on my understanding of the process.
---
World buffs, chat channels, auction houses, and fishing competitions are realm-wide and transcend Layers. Vendor stocks could be Layer dependent or not. Nodes are Layer specific but use different seeds for original spawn placement and random spawn timers. 
---
-If someone groups, transfer layers only if they are in or enter a rested area. Transfer to the group leader's layer.
---
Sounds like StoneTalon on Horde.
---
And Xroads in barrens
---
And Nesingway in stv
---
And TM in Hillsbrad.
---
God I cant wait for Wpvp lol
---
Its like the concepts of heaven and hell are fiction, that im living in actual hell, for blizz to dangle the carrot THIS CLOSE to my face just to have me realise the carrot was rotten
---
Also just to take away the grind at levels 58 - 60.
---
It depends on the faction. Horde has a bunch of nice quests in Hammerfall in that level range, but for Alliance there are very few quests except the Stromgarde Keep elite quests.
---
It's one of the reasons why STV feels more mandatory for Alliance than Horde.
---
I love hillsbrad foothills as horde but you are always at a level disadvantage because alliance go there at 30+ while horde can go there around 22-24
---
Not the worst mistake I read
---
I’m not sure I follow - I expect basically the same thing. If you think I’ve claimed that classic raids will take months to clear you have reading comprehension issues
---
STV. Absolute cancer.
---
Not being able to play beta is a chance tbh 
---
You will enjoy the launch much more
---
This is the most rewarding grind imo
---
&gt; As far as retail, is it maybe time for a 'WoW2'? 
---
Retail is already so different from vanilla that it practically IS a "wow 2".
---
A "wow 2" would not really be that much different from an expansion pack for existing WoW.
---
The opportunity only presents itself only in a set up situation, never in actuality.  If you are saving up 100 rage for executes in PvE you are missing out on damage.  Executing when you have enough rage for it is way more efficient use of your rage than this.  In PvP, it is impractical to try and save 100 rage to hit someone with an execute.  Yeah, you'd kill them when they are at 20%, but you would delay getting them to 20% by not using your other abilities.
---
They believe sharding is good technology and know the community hates it. So they rename it and tweak it so the community thinks it is something else. Then they slowly twist the knobs back to what they think is "good" like they have it on live.
---
It's called supply and demand. Tanks have leverage. Like it or hate it, but that's the reality.
---
&gt;Never said that, champ. Might want to brush up on your reading comprehension a bit.
---
No you implied it, So by your own admission the queue would be gone after a week or 2? Then whats the problem? 
---
&gt;I fought the point; tossing in an insult doesn't invalidate my argument, no matter how hurt your feefees are.
---
Mmmmhhhhh.
---
&gt;And if you're really interested in playing the game "as it was," you'd recognise that replicating the original experience (ie, number of players running around a zone, competing for quests and resources) is a hell of a lot more important than replicating what the servers are doing in the background (layering). 
---
Well if that is the case then what? Do you have layers of 500 people for the start? Then add 10 people per layer every day? How are you going to play with the same level of people you use to play with? 
---
&gt;Wanting as many people as possible to be able to play the game rather sitting in queues for hours is gatekeeping? And being okay with layering as a temporary solution to handle the massive initial influx of players until populations stabilise is "all the bells and whistles of modern wow?" Get a fucking grip, man.
---
Of course it is becasue its to the detrement to any players who want it as close to how it was back then, Why should I not be able to play on a single world rather than 10's of worlds? Id play on a non layered server over a layered server in a heartbeat but you are stopping that from ever happening by demanding all servers be layered so you can play day 1. You want layers? Go for it have fun, Why cant I have a non layered server? 
---
The biggest joy of classic wow is the world, A single breathing living world not hundreds of worlds exsisting side to side of eachother. I want to see that hunter questing at level 10 then have them show up when I hit level 45 and am just running around, That could never happen with sharding because I would never see them at level 10 in the first place. Give me a single world with all the pros and cons that come with it. 
---
&gt;Yeah, it really is a shame Blizzard couldn't crank out three hundred slightly different versions to cater to everyone who wanted a slightly different game but instead had to choose what they thought would be the best option for the most people.
---
Or just 1 set of "Real" servers and 1 set of "New" servers.
---
&gt;And if course, it's only people like me, the ones who aren't upset about layering, who are insulting others, amirite?
---
&gt;no matter how hurt your feefees are.
---
&gt;it's really only your, and a few other angry neckbeards',
---
&gt;Keep rocking that persecution complex, bud, it's a great look on you.
---
Yes... The only side downvoting due to not liking whats being said dispite not disbuting any of the points. 
---
Enjoy classic for the whole of the 2 weeks you play my friend.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-GobXQTf6w
---
Named mine chalupa back In classic. Loved that pink fuck
---
Nope, once in a lifetime is enough for me
---
It seems to be rating all items individually, but with +defense (and parry, dodge) you need to take your whole item set into account.  They are great stats until you have your crit immunity and crush immunity with shield block up.
---
Ah yes just to log in. Ignore the infrastructure costs, big fixes, GM support, and continuous free updates
---
That's true. I always assume everyone plays horde :p
---
Nice! Just don't kill a streamer more than once ;]
---
While leveling, you’re gonna be changing which dots you throw all the time based on when you got your newest rank, and how long it takes you to kill a mob. In general, if you are efficiently grinding 1 mob at a time, CoA won’t tick for the full duration and is probably less efficient.
---
I'll add if the opponent is a warrior, spam counterspell while getting into range. Sounds dumb, but the range on it is longer than the range on their charge and it puts them in combat so they can't charge. They never expect it and totally messes up their head
---
there are also quite a few unfinished zones in existing areas, Aszhara, Blasted Lands, Deadwind Pass, the demon area in Winterspring and probably many more smaller areas that i cant think of right now. Id love if they added content in existing zones like they did with Silithus, Searing Gorge, Hinterlands (horde)etc to make them more interesting
---
edit: grim batol, swamp of sorrows (lost ones storyline) always felt lacking, ravenholdt manor, warsong lumber camp in ashenvale, the silithid quests to carry over into silithus instead of stopping in ungoro... so many possibilities
---
I got dropped into the cauldron in searing gorge today. Do not recommend.
---
Did it in WotLK, one-shotting everything on my mage. Wasn’t that bad.  75 rep per quest if I remember right. 50 rep each and you actually have to kill the mobs, yeah.. that’s gonna take a while. 
---
I have Loremaster and Insane in the membrane in retail. I love stupid grinds like this. Probably gonna do it.
---
Did you miss the part where they said sharding would effectively be only for launch, and would be "a few weeks" at best, and "gone by phase 2" at worst?
---
You're talking as if Blizzard is dead set on having layering in the game forever.
---
I don't like it either, but it is a necessary evil because without it the game would be unplayable.
---
Did it once. I'll never do it again.
---
Its also to split the server community up and I dont like that. Like Iv said before 1 living breathing world not 3-4 worlds living next to eachother but still kinda exsiting in the same timeline.
---
It's so ridiculous on pservers...I remember getting 3 'rallying cry of the dragonslayer' in like..20min.
---
And those buffs are such a huge boon while leveling!! [Rallying Cry of the Dragonslayer](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?spell=22888) and [Warchief's Blessing](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?spell=16609) for reference. Those are immensely powerful at level 10 or 20 or 30 or just leveling in general.
---
But but but blizzard can suck his d...
---
People are tricked by Blizzard into thinking dead realms is a problem that's impossible to solve. They could offer free transfers away from the realms, but they are too greedy for that. Would rather force people to reroll on a new realm or pay to keep their character.
---
Well I hope not anyway! This would be tragic!
---
I think we should just start calling it sharding, because it's just sharding by another name. Except it's way more erratic than sharding.
---
It isn't, and they haven't, please link where they said their servers can't handle it. Yes, launch day is part of the experience, but launch day in vanilla was not a 15k pop, it was 3k per server, which is what every layer will have, so where exactly does this "single playerish game" come from? The hyperbole in this sub has reached critical levels.
---
Please notice the above is an edit aimed at humor. Don't go buying the stuff blindly thinking you'll get an invite to beta because that is NOT THE CASE.
---
Hands of Power too?
---
I think monthly fees will dissuade a lot of pserver players from even playing tbh...
---
&gt;Phase 1 will not last 6-8 months. If it does, then the more hard core players would burn out early 
---
I was going off their video when they were first talking about it. But 3 months seems like the realistic expectation. Even at three months I would say my point still stands.
---
&gt;What solution would you suggest besides layering, sharding, or adding more servers? There really aren't too many solutions to this problem. Blizzard has probably be posing this same question for months.
---
You have taken every option off the table. If I can't use more servers, I'll just say make a server that can hold more people. This would change how the game was originally designed though. So worst case using your set of conditions I would say make a set amount of servers and people just have to deal with the queue times.
---
Blood spec is supposed to have access to heartstop aura, but only frost does. The patch where they buffed it to 30% it was removed and when I asked a GM about it they confirmed it was a bug and told me to file a report and said they filed one as well.
---
If we also have 5x more level 60s, layering has failed, too few realms were created, and Blizzard cannot disable it by phase 2. So, sure, one can argue it is speculation, but if that isn't the case, then we have much, much bigger problems than the economy.
---
Zug Zug.
---
Really though thats awesome and I think Ill do the same. Until Horde get an equivalent
---
I just want to pay them $15/month (shit I'd pay more) for the game I bought and fell in love with 15 years ago.  I'm in sheer amazement that the private server experience, with all its flaws, will likely still be preferable to Classic.
---
Am I the only one who thinks these figures look dollar store/Fischer price quality? Looks like a toy I'd expect from a Happy Meal.
---
Certainly not something I'd spend $45.00 on and display.
---
If you have herbalism with having a lot of spare time you can pick up herbs, running around Wintersrping is a great opportunity for that.
---

The he put up his shield just like a big baby
---
And said "Man, man im just a paladin"
---
HEARTH!
---
My opinion doesn't align with yours so I'm "fucking awful", k. 15k pop was fucking awful and so far from Blizzlike.
---
“They’re putting chemicals in the water to turn the stinkin’ troggs gay!”
---
It would be alright, give spirit items to the priest since he has spirit tap most likely and int+stam to the warlock.
---
For those level ranges Horde has it even easier, since Barrens isn't contested territory at all and has quests beyond level 20. Thousand Needles also barely has any alliance quests, though there is a hub with a flight master and not much else IIRC.
---
I'm in the same boat, and the beauty of it is that they could still release TBC at some point in the future, after some post-classic development, as it wiped the relevance of all Classic content.
---
I'm positive we will see 5k player servers, hopefully not much more then this, but the tech can surely handle it, since wow classic has about a billion less calculations then legion had and legion could handle it. 
---
I get what you mean, but layering still only applies to alot of people being in the same area, and even if the population stays at 5k, it won't be 5k in a few single areas, it will be massively spread out. Which should mean, no layering is needed.
---
Layering is primarily there to prevent 500 people in the same area, from not being able to kill npc Mobs. Not much else. Although it has some weird side effects.
---
You know where to find us good luck
---
to be fair this has nothing to do with vanilla. its technically retail technology thats caused this.
---
&gt;Any feedback are welcome !
---
Well not to sound dickish but there's already a plethora of BIS lists, sites and apps out there. And yours is full of inaccuracies that people have pointed out. What's the point?
---
Having the Spectral Tiger is the only reason I still play retail, lol. /flex
---
They are ridiculously expensive these days
---
Try to stop me &lt;3
---
I kinda wanna go hunter for pvp but I feel like finding groups will be a pain
---
WHAT. I didn't know Smooth was on there... omg.
---
I also played vanilla, and to layering I say no. Please no.
---
These are awesome, keep up the great work! Loving the fan driven content around this!
---
Grats, but it was miserable for a lot of people.
---
So 3k pop isn't a living world? Then you didn't play vanilla. What do you mean 50% sharded and 50% non sharded? The layering is there to address a specific issue, not because some people like it.
---
Was in a guild called SAVAGES on a certain pserver and it was a lot of racism/sexism/homophobia/transphobia. Mind you, I met some good people there but the majority were asshats.
---
And yes, mostly just rude/inconsiderate.
---
n1 bis list, just wondering - shouldn't for mages/warlocks the weapon 1 (pre-raid) bis be witchblade ( [https://classicdb.ch/?item=13964#comments](https://classicdb.ch/?item=13964#comments) )
---
or is it not available in phase 1? (not 100% sure)
---
My point exactly! By addind layering they are indeed trying to appease the more casual crowd, the so called tourists, which they already know will be gone in a matter of weeks if not days. Its so unbelievably stupid of them, by now it should be clear that the crowd that will stay once the dust settles, is the pure vanilla crowd. The people who dont want nothing of that piece of shit layering. The people who endured years of laggy and crashing private servers owned by Pyotr and his adidas tracksuit wearing friends.
---
I really hope Pyotr will keep his server running post aug 27th
---
Anti-classic idiots have been arguing that it's only Nostalgia, but fortunately we have won and proven them wrong. It's 100% the better game, it isn't even a question anymore and shouldn't really have been at all.
---
Vanilla wow is the best game ever created, retail is trash.
---
The only thing I recall being addressed was the hunter pouch+ammo+autoshot bug. Spawn rates are still just as fucked up in Whelgars excavation and the rotting orchard as day 1. People are still being dropped of gryphons frequently with various reasons given. Pets are still extremely broken especially warlock pets.
---
I can't wait to farm Devilsaur on all 10 layers of my realm!
---
Not a chance. I'm taking my grinding spots to my grave.
---
I am talking strictly about the use of layering and not about release phases of classic. Also I am using 1 month as an example range of what I think wouldn't be bad for long term, not that it will be 1 month.
---
For real. Especially if the lock has a felhunter out. I just run.
---
tell him he has no proof and to get over it lol
---
They are not the same. Literally by definition. Don’t be an idiot. 
---
And layering IS happening so get used to it.
---
As a warlock ypu are allowed to press a curse of elements to buff the mages every now and then
---
Well no. I'm just going to get exalted with darn by running for 30min or so from elwin to teldrassil and pretending to be a night elf warrior from 1-40ish.
---
Oh ya I forgot how important wands are lol
---
?? I still don't see a solution to any problem. You acting like layering won't be removed isn't solving any made up problems. How is acting like layering won't be removed a preventative measure? Preventative of what exactly?
---
Word.
---
There is many more mount collectors now than there was back then, of course more people are going to have rare mounts. There is an incentive to grind more mounts in the form of achievements. Unlike vanilla the game has a lot of collectibles, which has in turn attracted a lot of collectors. All of this has resulted in the increase. A rare mount is a rare mount. Nobody gives a shit about the common ones but rest assured many still covet the rare drops or achievement/puzzle rewards.
---
Lol like you'll be able to get any kills... already streamers and guilds rotating the layers.
---
I don’t think he’s saying he doesn’t want to be in or play it, but that his account should not have been flagged for an invite due to his inactivity and a previous account being banned for cheating. Meanwhile there are people who have been subbed for 15 years actively, never been banned etc. that didn’t get in. I’m in the same boat as OP I signed up to test ASAP, resubbed my new wow account, (my original account from 2004 was banned for botting) and I was accepted. I’m glad to be in, but feel like there are people who deserved it more
---
Doesn't have any of the duskwhisper gorge caves
---
Layering addresses convergence and allows the server to maximize synergy with the underlying data sets that would otherwise fall victim to nonconformity in the target demographic, and anyone who remembers the virtual array incongruity bubble pop knows where I am going with this.
---
World buffs, chat channels, auction houses, and fishing competitions are realm-wide and transcend Layers. Vendor stocks could be Layer dependent or not. Nodes are Layer specific but use different seeds for original spawn placement and random spawn timers.
---
Layers will be non existent by the time your high enough to kill a Devilsaur from my understanding.
---
Inbox me 😜 ill be on an oce server anyway (if we get them)
---
Yes or dispense health cookies for the tank.
---
I’m not trying to claim that or racials imbalanced the factions, but resisting almost half of all stuns is crazy fucking good, I don’t know why you’re trying to downplay it. There’s a reason they changed it to reduce the duration instead, and it’s because outright resisting 40% of all incoming stuns is busted.
---
That's the absolute longest it could possibly be in the game. Ion said they want to remove it as early as they reasonably can, depending on how many people stick around and for how long.
---
I believe he said ideally it'd only last a week or two, but that's obviously dependent on other factors.
---
“Practical” 
---
“Very unlikely and specific scenario must present itself” 
---
Dude - what?
---
Whelps in Swamp of Sorrows
---
Pretty much any Whelps since dragonkin have the best loot tables and Whelps die to melee quickly.
---
Nice video mate ! Dont listen to the haters keep doing your thing
---
You assume this is a bug and not "working as intended" whilst having the wool pulled over our eyes
---
This was my original point. Inconveniences produce organic fun in games. I think the shitshow of a crowded launch is a much better alternative to layering.
---
Dang I actually didn’t know that.

&gt; Raids are mechanically harder, so much that they aren't even comparable
---
You:
---
&gt;iS tHaT wHy VaNiLlA tOoK lOnGeR?
---
You disingenuously claimed that the earlier raids took months because they were more difficult. Players weren't nearly as good at the game as they are now. My point is that Vanilla raids are objectively some of the easiest raid content WoW has ever offered. They did not take longer because they were more difficult. A competent group could not clear a modern mythic 2 days after reaching level cap. A competent group WILL clear MC 2 days after level cap. It all stemmed back to your -10 point comment, for clarity.
---
Incorrect - they said it will be present for phase 1.  We don't know what the exact time frame for phases will be, but it would be fair to assume around 2-4 months.
---
It is the Kharanos Inn, that [dwarf](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=1232/azar-stronghammer) is the paladin trainer
---
I don't have access to a definitive list, but lots of things here and there have been addressed.
---
e.g. the ability to change nameplate loading distance, and (not a bug that was fixed) extensive verification of mob damage/parry/armor
---
Give them a chance. They have done a decent amount in a very short space of time.
---
I would say it's reasonable to start being critical/panicking if there's still glaring problems ~5 weeks before launch. Given their current pace of fixing things, and given a reasonable buffer to be "done" before actually launching the game.
---
So give them ~6 weeks, from now, to fix most things.
---
It even **is** a direct violation of the rules.
---
&gt;I'm going off of information given by a Blizzard employee. But I'm sure you, a random redditor, knows better than Blizzard.
---
You mean the countless interviews where they said a couple of weeks into release? Ah yes, let's ignore those interviews because it doesn't fit your doomsday narrative.
---
&gt;Why do you like to sexually assault kids? WTF is wrong with you?
---
Clearly you don't know what insinuating means, but that's all right, you'll learn eventually.
---
&gt;Hahahaha, let me guess, you get scammed by Nigerian princes on a daily basis, don't you?
---
Why are they fixing bugs and stuff in the beta if it's the released game? Why is it level capped if it's the released game? Ah yes, I guess that's just random fixes and has nothing to do with the bug reports.
---
Are there any popular Horde streamers? We need an Alliance equivalent (Three Musketeers?) and when these two rogue groups meeting in the field they just /salute and go about their own buisness.
---
Omg lol.  Yeah, I figured it would take you forever to do all that.  I'm surprised though that you can manually do this with paint though.  Good job!
---
I mean, Vanilla is the true expansion of Min/Maxing why would you want to preform less than your peers because you like having a shield and being deep prot? When there are specs that are vastly superior. I don't understand why you feel the need to insult me based on the fact that i brought forward new information that you obviously didn't know and think you are too good to take advice from someone who has probably been involved with the vanilla community a lot longer than you have. Having tanked on multiple private servers there is a new meta for tanking so you will either adapt or be left behind. I was just trying to make you a better tank in what people will be running now. But if you want to stick to your old ways, not be able to dps and have shitty threat by comparison be my guest man.
---
Also doesn't blasted lands have the hero of the horde quest line for the demon?
---
The technology isn't what they claimed it to be in the same time they claimed it would only be in for phase 1. They said people wouldn't get phased in and out like happens on sharding, but that isn't true. The base functionality different from sharding that the system was built for is just not true, so why would I believe them on their timeframe that it would be turned off?
---
I wouldn't be worried about being bent over by Blizz.  I'm on the Beta PVE server and it's dead.  I have been in almost every beta since BC and they make changes before launch after identifying an issue and just never talk about it.  So, you really won't see if there is an issue with layering until you see the actual production version of layering.  
---
Any issues with layering will most likely be minimal with only the hardest core nerds trying to pick it apart because they dont really understand it.  And I say don't understand it because Blizz is not going to give us the dev level walk though of how that really works, they will always only give us the layman's explanation.
---
They were some of the highest anticipated for PC games of that year however.  Also just because a game was not top 3 does not make it mediocre.  My arguement was not about being "highest anticipated game" but about the statement that the game was "mediocre".
---
I almost wanna ask for the Horde raptor questline to be included even tho it wasn't added until wotlk.
---
He's talking about the Diplomacy racial. I did the grind along side a Human priest.  She finished a while before I did.
---
Its not "very unlikely" to get 100 rage when you are the paintrain in a BG with pocket healers. Trust me.
---
Devilsaur Mafia!!
---
Only 50? #notmyclassic
---
That same painting is all around dwarven buildings
---
I guess this is where we fundamentally disagree. I'd rather have fewer more full servers that have problems with layering occasionally (which hopefully wont even occur, if Blizzard irons out whatever bugs there may be) with a finite end than too many servers with population spread too thin over them. This is a problem we see in retail and have since maybe the tail end of WOTK. I'd imagine in classic it will come sooner with a set number of phases, and the fact that it is content that has been released previously and is 15 years old, but this time there's no account services planned to be implemented.
---
You can't bubble hearth until lvl50~
---
I'm not somewhere i can watch the video right now, but will definitely take a look later today.
---
Have you played any of these builds? We played when these were relevant, there's always possible builds but many fall short of others. And considering blizzard is minimizing changes to classic wow, it will end up being the same as it used to be. If you want to compete in the endgame, you will need to have the best build or get left behind
---
zug zug brother
---
Then he soulstones and kills your quest mob lol
---
So clue me in on what occurs for servers at the end of phase 1 that still have too high a population for removing phasing? You think they are "going to let" there be 10k queues? Or do you think they will also at that point make a post about how layering needs to continue for the meantime until they can get a better "system" in place so there aren't giant queues?
---
It’s a beta test, not an early access.
---
Blizzard did this with MoP and it was a disaster.
---
Sorry you didn’t make it into the beta, but that’s a terrible idea.
---
Not sure if joking but layers won't be a thing that late in the game
---
This is great. [Gem](https://youtu.be/Q-GobXQTf6w?t=69).
---
Reminds me of [this](https://youtu.be/D2jeTaX952A) podcast. Don't have a link to the exact spot but he talks about how originally the WoW team had no idea about the retention they would have for Classic and how much they underestimated it. I feel like this is very similar. They feel like they have it all figured out. But what if it's a superhit? What then?
---
Dwarves like human females.
---
Because the the raids will all be cleared on the first night, before Method even gets a chance to start.
---
It's in human buildings a well, even one in SM library
---
It's almost like we're currently in a beta test where they can iron out these issues, not the final released game.
---
The pets can sell well
---
Right but I do think it’s important that we will all be together, which is what my concern is.
---
Really what I would support is some sharding in starter zones but once you get to contested no sharding. Easier said than done probably but I like the chaos. Only problem that I don’t have any solution to is dead servers. They’ll put out fewer servers and just do layering so the population will be less of an impact cause each server will be large to start with.

---
&gt; Incorrect - they said it will be present for phase 1. We don't know what the exact time frame for phases will be, but it would be fair to assume around 2-4 months.
---
Perfectly said. If there's anything the last 15 years of WoW should have taught us, it's that adding "quality of life" changes to a game does *not* always make the game more fun.
---
Video games are still *games*. Games need challenge and inconveniences.
---
I thought they said only 2 weeks into Phase 1?
---
Regardless, they just can't have layering lasting past a week or two without completely destroying the Classic experience and the economy.
---
There's people on Beta getting multiple Arena Masters in a 10 minute span and entire guilds monopolizing on certain farm zones by spamming all the layers.
---
It's textbook exploiting the game and it will do far more harm than good leaving it in the game beyond the starter zones. There's already a mountain of evidence in this beta already showing how people are exploiting it.
---
Is it really possible to create new terrain, creatures and quests?
---
How do you switch layers? Im not up to date
---
Humans like human females
---
This is looking incredible. I can't wait to see the new features as they roll out.
---
i did it once before so why not
---
What is actually being shown in OPs video?
---
If you're doing this looking for a few spots you didn't know about I'd recommend Frostadomus youtube channel. I've learned plenty from him and with that knowledge have laid out a leveling route with grinding pit stops along the way.
---
I’d like to say that I believe Eye of Rend is actually BiS for dagger rogues, as your setup currently has 11% hit before including the helmet, which has another 2% hit on it.  
---
Most dagger rogues go with Crit &gt; Hit after 8% (9% on classic now after the post), which means Eye of Rend would be better than Mask of the Unforgiven.
---
you will be fine with the spec. Just keep in mind that shaman will be extremely popular.
---
You are right. I can take another pass at it but between the satellite and the fact that it's mostly the stock tunnel it seemed like it would be more confusing than helpful.
---
Love these guys.
---
Have you seen alpha Ironforge ? That was a real dwarven city built in a mountain dude, the retail IF looks like a joke compared to it . (even if I still like it)
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOTtEpXf4b0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOTtEpXf4b0)
---
It had one additional floor, an underground lava cave and even elevators
---
What we got in the final game was nowhere near as epic  but much more conveniant and easy which is why it was reworked, people were getting lost.
---
Sounds like a very specific scenario to me but whatever man. 
---
I think his point was that you’re not going to be just running around the world dumping 100 rage executes into people.
---
You cold have a mage hitting a fireball, same effect I believe.
---
Gatekeeping server launches now are we?
---
Relog or have someone in another layer invite you to their party.
---
Me not that kind of orc!
---
It was great fun, Enjoyed meeting people.
---
What? Okay few things here: nothing’s being cleared on the first night. And also, classic is releasing globally at the same time.
---
The pet is just the bonus drop. The real money comes from the mats they drop that are used in Fire Resistance gear/pots.
---
For a few weeks, we may switch between layers, but my buddies will still be there and by the time it is 1 layer, no one will notice.
---
This book is amazing if you have a deep appreciation for vanilla and massive projects ... highly recommend
---
I love frost thats what im watching right now! Half the reason for the post, other half was me remembering going to farm and just ended up pvping so was curious where others farm
---
&gt; damage will already be done
---
Layering is to mitigate damage of dead servers. I'd rather have layering and not run into some of the pop (which is feasible without layer), than have
---
1) over populated questing areas at launch.  
---
2) dead servers after launch.
---
What if wow classic is the alternate timeline version of Azeroth aka WoD's  Draenor's actual Azeroth?  
---
Could create new and better alternative expansions. LEt the developers fix past expansions mistakes or do things differently.
---
oh wait its Blizz it would be shit show.
---
Sadly Sylvanas torched it. Entire island is gone. You can't even go there anymore after you complete the story quest where it happens. ;( Story quest happens on both factions, though - just seeing different sides of the story.
---
I would be so into that but this requires them to provide the new assets. The world model update would essentially require a revamp similar Cataclysm. The old textures were often not replaced but the whole items were replaced. And there you would essentially require both assets on the client making it bigger.
---
528,300 people cares about this washed up guy
---
Any news ?
---
that is correct, we were thinking of using a mage to Fire Blast the target but it couldn't be a Trial Mage, since the damage is high enough that it would oneshot the Yeti. Also we had just the one account each, so it would take a third person, leveling a mage high enough to enter the zone and do this, which would be much more difficult to co-ordinate
---
I agree with you - it is a game breaking issue.  Unfortunately their official plan at this time is to have it active for the entirety of phase one.
---
Error 404: Point Not Found
---
r/gatekeeping  😋
---
Yep, this is absolutely on the list. Getting the nerfed version was not nearly as gratifying as the mega grind.
---
This pasta is weeks old dude
---
Oh yes, and the title!
---
But if we want classic and they're giving classic, why does that matter? Its not about motive, its about getting what we want. And we are.
---
Absolutely! Did it the first time, doing it again while im mindlessly farming black lotus and waiting for raids!
---
Should have put on my aluminum foil hat before reading this
---
Having a paywall absolutely does change that. There are thousands that won’t play classic because it’s 15/mo. I get what you’re saying and I don’t like the idea of layering, but the game isn’t as accessible as pservers.

Cataclysm could have been so much better if they had just gotten rid of LfD, flying mounts, and heirloom gear. It could have been an opportunity to reexplore and reimagine the world.

Dude, just got BFA a few weeks ago and totally agree that the female Gnome faces are so fucked up. Rolling that blue eye face in classic 👌🏻

The work-around at my job is using google translate to “translate” the webpages from “Spanish” to English. Some of the wording in articles is funky due to the “translation”, but I can view sites that are otherwise disabled /blocked

Player housing, l m a o

Yes of course
---
Yea pretty sure its like 1 month at 16 hours a day
---
You're right about level 58, I misread it somehow. Then indeed you barely get anything during these two levels.
---
Useful in phase whichever when they add the imp vendor for tier 0.5
---
Wow thats awesome man, but you also don't know who got R14 on horde side, right?
---
Thank you for posting these. I have the physical books and didn't want to use them as working copies.
---
The fix here is probably a lot simpler than people think. All blizzard has to do is put something in the code that doesn't allow players to loot the same asset across multiple layers. If you were to mine/herb/loot a chest/etc... it is registered and will not allow manipulation like seen here. This way layering can still be effective in allowing players to level correctly in the early stages and group with friends, while preventing abuse of the system for personal gains.
---
Specific to starting zones, no?
---
"  They are just putting on this show to make you think that they care. "
---
I feel like people know, but don't care because 'Vanilla'. It's an obvious tactic to bring in absolute anyone and everyone into a Subscription fee. I'm not complaining though, since if it brings joy I'll be keeping it for a while and when I'm bored, I'll stop. Favorite MMO by far. If others don't like it, they'll stop and Blizz gets less and less $. Same shit with Anthem, when Origin did their gd best to force you into a Sub (how they rolled out the game) as opposed to just purchasing it(or you got juked and did both). At least Classic has a lot of content and a unique formula for an mmorpg, albeit a resurrection of a game.
---
Retail as we know it tells you what you should grind for.  Ion has always been a math and numbers guy.  So they sit there in a meeting and go, "Ok, this part of the game should take you about 5 days to complete.  So we take the total divide by 5, then limit your gains every day to that 1/5th and tell you what to do to meet that 1/5th.
---
Classic doesn't tell you what to do.  They give you goals and let you figure out how to get there.  There isn't anyone telling you exactly what to do.  "Ok that costs a lot of money.  Should I farm the mats for it, or do I know a better way to make gold to straight out buy it?  Do I want to take the profession to craft it myself?  I can use that for more gold after... etc."  While some parts are more shallow (killing a single boss to get a piece of gear) you're never explicitly told to go do that.  The game gives you a character and you make your own goals.  
---
BfA and other expansions beyond, I'd even say, TBC observed what player's goals were and then made a game around giving players ways to meet those goals.  Classic dumped you in a world and let you do whatever you want.  There are no goals and that's more fun to play than a game with explicit goals.  
---
The game is simple in nature.  Even for endgame content most people are just pressing a single button.  The gameplay isn't exactly what makes the game fun.  It's the limitations and the resultant choices that makes the game "fun" to try and figure out.  Killing mobs the game tells you to kill isn't as fun as figuring out what you want to do and what mobs you need to kill to get there.  
---
TL;DR - When the game sets no goals, players have more fun making their own goals.  When BfA sets goals and to-do lists it becomes more of a chore.
---
(Obviously the game needs to have good mechanics and underlying systems to facilitate that lack of direction.  No one tells you to raid, you want to raid because it exists.)

---
I'm confused on your formula. Doesn't spirit increase Mp5 and not Int? I might be reading it wrong.
---
They already did something about it, they said they were going to turn layering off after a certain point.
---
poor design decision with negative effects still today...
---
Player Housing
---
What's the point? The garrisons were a bust. 
---
I'd rather have the ability to set my Hearthstone at any X/Y location on the map than have a house with a few cosmetic items in it.
---
Let us say that you are correct and they are lying about what you say. What are the consequences? Why does it matter?
---
Also incorrect - layering effects the whole world, not starting zones exclusively.
---
EDIT: You may be confusing layering with sharding, which is no longer their plan.
---
Warlocks need tailoring at lvl 60 once zg arrives.  You get a 2% crit bonus from the bloodvine set.
---
Alchemy is a bit over rated because you can just have a guild mate make your potions for you.  If you do get alchemy then you are the guy stuck making all the pots.  
---
Engineering is the best profession in the game.  Any serious lvl 60 raider or pvper will have it.
---
Herbalism is also a must have for a level 60 because consumes are a big part of raiding and it's the most lucrative gathering profession
---
This time around it will be done!
---
Southern Coast could be a nice place to put a Bloodsail Buccaneer hub, some place to hang out at if you raised their rep over Booty Bay
---
I think it's more about aligning it with all the other systems in the games resetting for that week.  If the whole world had the raid open on Tues, then NA guilds would have an advantage in having all their weekly resets available, while EU/KOREA/CHINA would not. 
---
If they wanted to move to a worldwide simultaneous release, I think Saturday would be ideal.  Gives all regions a chance to do their weekly reset power gains.  Great chance for viewing parties of the kickoff of the race.  Still doesn't remove the staggered realm weekly reset and power gain though.  I highly doubt Blizz wants to move around so many systems just to support the race either.
---
I did it before and i will do it again. Because... why not?
---
or the supply bags in the harpy area of Durotar
---
This is an interesting solution for sure.  Sounds like this would have potential to work.  But really, this is complex server architecture stuff, and there might be reasons why this wouldn't work.  We can only put our faith in blizzard engineers (they are pretty good).
---
I actually did this grind again on my newer wow account, the grind was nerfed in Cataclysm, right?
---
Doesn’t look cool enough to be worth it
---
They had it very early on, in 1.12 I think you just need to be exalted with the relevant faction. Which in Classic is a stupid and expensive thing to grind out and will take you forever.
---
Yeah, I get that. I was just pointing out that even without the rep bonus it is still required for gnomes.
---
I did this grind and I was soo proud of this mount.  - Cut to many years later after being away from the game.  I logged and hop on my Wintersaber, still proud of my achievement and showing her off around Stormwind.  Like reconnecting with a old friend.  My friend\[a activate sub\] shortly told me, it's a simple quest now.  I was immediately heartbroken.  I won't lie, l'm still a little salty till this day.
---
r/lgbdq 😋
---
Quest helpers were in Vanilla. Add-ons were a big part of Vanilla.
---
That suggests it's not working like it's intended for release, supposedly you're supposed to stick to a layer once you get invited to it. You should report it.
---
I got aids reading this post
---
ok, this seemed like an even better explanation and i might be able to get behind that.  me hero doesnt need to be the slayer of elemental lords but saying go exploring molten core and "oh jeez, some lava surgers almost had us meet our maker when we went exploring the other week"  
---
so the only problem would be myself claiming to be the god-slayer really. i get it, and we all agree on a even playing-field.  
---
well.. maybe i can´t wait until classic RP comes. maybe i´ll check it out on live.   
---
thanks for replying!
---
In TBC my buds and I all rolled undead alts but decided we wanted to level in the Blood Elf area. Instead of using the orb like quitters we ran through the plaguelands like heroes. It was fun throwing a useless PW:Sheild on my buddy just for a diseased bear to come and one shot him anyway. When we finally made it we spammed our gchat touting our achievement. They didn't seem to be as excited as we were.
---
How does dividing a sever into 3 layers affect hardware?..
---
Hold on, let me get my tinfoil hat.
---
Yeah gotta say I always preferred a day/night cycle detached from the real time.

But it's as amusing as the Navy SEAL copypasta

Do dragonkin really have the best loot tables? I have heard this before but I haven't actually found any data or evidence supporting it. Honestly curious.

I was on a pserver with 14-15k its not that bad dude.

I remember as a kid playing that I was disappointed in how Sylvanas looked compared to in WC3. She doesn't look anything like a ranger general. If you just only gave her a large bow on her back and some better clothes she would look 10x better.

Ahh yeah I'm possibly getting a few wires crossed. Thanks :)

I can pull Lady Blameaux to the safe zone a second time and wipe the raid again, 12 years later!
---
Yes, I was a hunter. Yes, I panicked and feigned death way too late.
---
I was actually gunna dedicate a whole small zone to them in kalimdor (next to dustwallow marsh and thousand needles)
---
What was the timer on the re-spawn? Does it cap out?
---
You’re missing the point , this is an excerpt about inspiration they had around other devs at a gaming convention and how it got them thinking about the possibilities
---
Defias would make sense, but I think the greenery on the south shore would have to extend a little further, include some poorer/isolated farmers. I don't think them having a hub there makes too too much sense as Deadmines was their final HQ.
---
Though I do like the Timbermaw idea. Maybe a gnome faction since its sitting right on top of the tram. My other idea was putting House Prestor's manor around those parts as well.
---
It was removed in 1.12 but Blizzard decided to use the pre 1.12 mount system.
---
What the fuck did you just say about me?
---
What ?
---
Appreciate the kind words :). They dont bother me at all. People can hate all they want, even the shit feed back helps me get better.
---
People complain about layering ruining the spirit of classic, but really the streamer is the one who's not playing in the spirit of classic. He heard about enemy players outside of the game from someone who was not on his layer. Really his layer should be behaving like his server, and he wouldn't have heard about it at all if he were just playing with a guild or some friends who will all be on the same layer in release.
---
Maybe if you were grinding for Rank 14. There were far to many people and you would never meet those people out in the world. You also didn't care what guilds they were in like you would if they were on your server.
---
Oh of course, they got the idea from Animal Crossing, a completely different style of game. Silly me I would have thought they got the idea from EQ or DAOC, other MMOs that had synchronized day/night cycles. Perhaps it is just not prudent to say that you are copying other games in your game's genre.
---
We don't know yet.
---
&gt; Until Horde get an equivalent

So, forever?

How much will you charge per run? 😝

wouldve been cool if you had the chance to rent/buy houses in sw or sth.

im okay with it it wasnt a thing, but boy i imagine seeing house and estatesellers haha

Okay take my money blizzard because I’m trying to get as much entertainment out of them as possible. Haha those suckers will never know what hit em.

Gnome Warlock here.
---
How you gonna do that when you're chain-feared across the map?
---
Also, a positive for Classic WoW Horde: You have a real Warchief again. :D
---
Dunno. They haven’t said.
---
Yea. Like do a server that later includes all the stuff that was originally planned but skipped. But have the no-changes servers as well. If Bitcoin can fork into a million useless versions, surely we can have Vanilla, Vanilla+, and TBC onward.
---
That cave is in there!
---
A big guild has less Resource to corner as it's all on one server. Less Lotus, less Devilsaurs etc.
---
You'll just die over and over...
---
I'm going to go against the grain and say you can no-life this one. My buddy got this mount and would spend 8 hrs/day grinding in Winterspring.
---
Wouldn't miss it.
---
I upvote all these posts and gotta say that I enjoy this endeavour. It’s so interesting seeing some potential being unlocked in the areas
---
&gt;Grats, but it was miserable for a lot of people.
---
And that fine they can have their own servers with lots of layering and LFG and stuff but why cant I have a server without it all?
---
&gt;What do you mean 50% sharded and 50% non sharded? The layering is there to address a specific issue, not because some people like it
---
I just simply do not see a problem with having other players in my MMO, I dont see that as an issue and never have. Iv loved the launch of every private server iv played on even when the zones are too full for me to quest without issues day 1. This does not solve any issues for me it casuses issues where there were none before. 
---
3K pop is certinaly a living world but who says Blizzard will live up to their word? Live can bearly handle 40 people in a single zone so why would I believe they will have 3K people in each layer? What about player number 3001 do they get their own shard? What if no one else joins that shard? Are they just paying solo their entire play time? This is 100% put into place becasue some people dont want to have to play with other people and limiting that number limits the aggro from those players.
---
Ah my bad, couldn’t see it to click on it.
---
I was always of the opinion of instead of the first expansion taking place in the entirety of Outland...Blizzard should have focused on fleshing out the main continents of Azeroth and Kalimdor more. One of the biggest draws for the game at the time was the fact that you had this huge continent that was seamless with very little loading screens. Even today you don't see this very often in MMOs, with each zone only being accessible via a "zone portal."  
---
I was really disappointed when I saw that in order to get to Ghostlands you had to go through a little portal.
---
Yup everytime I see a mount today I'm like "noob just logged on" not like in my day!
---
No way are they farming 1% drop chance, grinding rep, or working for achievements. Now you just get mounts for logging on.
---
I feel like I’m living in ”Groundhog Day”
---
Did it once and I'd do it again
---
Is there anything like this that is horde specific?
---
On some Servers the Paladin shield has 500 Armour More....
---
When did blizzard merger servers?
---
It allows you to re-assess which rank you might use in the future for said target, and whether you’re playing like shit or not in general. The only healer who shan’t care much about spamming is a Paladin because they live outside the 5 sec rule anyway. 
---
Effective healing is the name of the game, and seeing a lot of healing wasted might help you restructure/improve the way you’re healing.
---
Inbox me too
---
I know they have said that if Classic is a success then we will likely get BC servers. I’ve also seen people say that it’s possible they will create new content for Classic after the Naxx patch, like they’ve done in OSRS.
---
That feature is planned. We know it's a little confusing right now without any entrance, exits, or floor markers. Soon TM

He's going a bit tinfoil hat here but motivation is pretty important. Stranger offering you candy in an unmarked white van? What does it matter man. You like candy don't you?
---
Yes mediocre in sales, not in actual gameplay (that much is subjective).  Rome 2 still sold more copies than both Warhammers combined, that’s mediocre performance in *sales*.
---
I hope they eventually do the same as Alliance as well. Gnomes?
---
I played horde in vanilla but overall I do play alliance more ._.
---
Yeah I never had T3, but in T2 I already felt plenty powerful in PvP and PvE. BWL gear is a VERY solid boost over MC, enough to easily dominate a MC-geared opponent 1v1, or take on 2-3 blue-geared opponents. 
---
There really doesn't need to be a gear level that is at least 50% beyond that. It's basically level 70 gear in Vanilla, and truly breaks the game.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
in the classic discord if you try to discus layering it gets deleted
---
&gt;You have taken every option off the table. If I can't use more servers, I'll just say make a server that can hold more people. This would change how the game was originally designed though. So worst case using your set of conditions I would say make a set amount of servers and people just have to deal with the queue times.
---
Removing all the options was the point.  There isn't a good option.  And the queue times would only be a small part of the issues.  The main issue without layering/sharding would be player experience.  Can you imagine trying to do drop quests with 500 other people all trying to do those same quests?  That is how every quest would be for the first 20-40 levels.  Sharding and layering split the player population to alleviate these areas and allow you to actually play the game.
---
&gt;They didn't seem to be as excited as we were.
---
Ha ha.
---
The thing I’m worried about is the negative impact on the social aspect of actual vanilla. The fact is that layering takes people who are doing the same quests I’m doing and removes them from my view. My oldest wow friend I met in Jangolode mine when we randomly walked by each other and offered to help. 
---
I’m sure it’s necessary early on but I fear layering will really harm late game play starting around level 30-40.
---
The ravasaur wasn't added until WotLK.
---
lol I know right!
---
I dont see an issue with over pupulated questing areas at launch. I enjoy other people being in my MMO. Mitigate damage of dead servers by launching a few and let people funnel out. Sure they will be mad they didn't kill a boar day 1 hour 1 but they have live to play should they wish to do that.
---
i like your thinking!
---
Not up to date on my lore, so I can't comment on which continent they are most present in, I just remember most of their members being humans, so Eastern Kingdoms made sense.
---
Pservers use dynamic spawns and classic 100% won't. It'll be that bad.
---
Likewise, I was fire from 1-60. Levelling with Impact was fantastic. Had to switch at 60 though due to MC. Tried to argue with my GM at the time about it but to no avail xD
---
If you do Darnassus quests as you level, it's pretty easy to hit exalted by 40 as a human. You just have to do the quests before they turn grey.
---
He did as well, everything but my dragon dagger, hylian crest, and master hand ones are done by him, got a bunch of Pokemon/Nintendo stuff on the other side aswell
---
The link request was prompted specifically by the mention of a *clip of rage quitting*.
---
Father of five that’ll be undoubtedly brainwashed into a pessimistic outlook on everything in life.
---
Cata changed everything completely in on fell swoop though. And it completly ruined the vanilla pacing. Sure at that point we all had done it several times over...but what we were given was an on rails experience that was so easy it put you to sleep.
---
Night elves start out with the ability to ride nightsabers. Humans have to get exalted with darnassus to do so, in addition to getting exalted with the winterspring nightsaber trainers.
---
i loved collecting the rare pets. The white bear outside ironforge, the red spider from duskwood, etc.
---
I mean if the community for some reason all piles into the same server and just ruins population dispersity, then that's a bigger problem in itself. And I'd be pretty shocked if there is a server big enough for a 10k queue 6 months from launch, or whenever Phase 2 comes out.
---
Either way, layering is simply a measure against zone overcrowding during the initial few weeks/months of Classic. The only way layering could become a long term issue is if somehow Classic retained it's launch populations numbers, or the population grows post launch. Both of which would be pretty surprising, but would most likely just lead to new servers opening.
---
Again, layering is a temporary solution to an over-represented population(compared to servers available) when Classic launches.
---
This is such quality content, I could swear its some kind of markething plug.
---
They are actually based in a place called plunder isle in the middle of the map somewhere
---
It is I said "resources being doubled", trinkets are not a resource. Things like Black Lotus and Devilsaur leather. Although those being used and not sold would indeed be a noticeable advantage.
---
There is no such thing as overcrowding in the world. This is an MMO, I want to play with other people. I want to chat, I want to do things that are not on the check list. 
---
I also dont believe that blizzard will ever remove laying or wont bring it back at a later date but thats becasue iv played their games for quite some time and know who they are as a company. 
---
Give me 1 world, All players in that world with all the upsides and downsides that come with it.
---
I don't want to say no, but I don't think it's feasible. There's a few obstacles to figure out first.
---
For one, I don't know how a bot could identify only Classic related posts, bar trying to identify particular keywords and which subforum it was posted in, the former causing issues with misidentifying things. You guys might've noticed yesterday, and the day before, a lot of posts get removed for WSIP Wednesday and LFG Monday by AutoModerator, that was us having teething issues with new filters (that we've disabled until we think it will work better). 
---
Secondly, sidebar space is something of a premium. If it's fully embedded into the sidebar (which would require a custom bot with full moderator permissions - the programming of which is an issue) it is going to take up a lot of space. We *need* the rules and weekly threads, FAQ, and Community Resources to be visible, and we'd like to keep everything else on the sidebar visible too. 
---
If it's just a link to a blue post tracker I'd be very surprised if there is any significant amount of people here not aware of MMO-C and Wowhead's blue trackers, to use those following a very simple google search. We'd be giving up sidebar space to tell people to about something they already know about. 
---
Finally, if we do link to an external blue post tracker, we'd have to give consideration which we want to link to, due to concerns about where the community would want us directing traffic, and so on. This is a minor thing, but I like to give the full story.
---
&gt;Can you imagine trying to do drop quests with 500 other people all trying to do those same quests?
---
I hate to tell you this but layering was not made to fix this. In fact it will be even harder to level in starting zones due to "layering" because your server will need be fully maxed out before a new server layer is made. Unlike sharding this is server wide so it wont matter if there are 4 thousand people in the starting zone.
---
Two years on that quest now
---
Hmm, this actually seems like a good compromise. We will still see the disturbing affect when crossing layers but the exploitability problem is solved for higher level zones which is what many are concerned with. I think we could put up with this for a couple weeks knowing that after level 20 or so you are in the grown-up world!
---
There’s no source to that, they never said that
---
It only won’t work when you’re moving. Pick Pocket is a cast even though it should be instant. Test it for yourself, try moving and you’ll never get it off, while if you’re still behind the target it should work 100% of the time.
---
They also said it was for starting zones only prior. We have been down this slippery slope before.
---
You're right that not every raid guild will be tryhard, but I can guarantee the average player will be much more knowledgeable than they were in Vanilla thanks to YouTube, Reddit, etc. Classic is going to be a different game than vanilla was, largely because of these resources, and sticking to old strategies and playstyles will hold you and your raid back.
---
Uh oh it’s the guy with 5 kids who’s angry he can’t play
---
&gt;	3/4 on the timer in ZA, some in SSC and TK.
---
So you really only experienced half the game then. Makes sense.
---
If you level in Kalimdor, you can hit exalted with Darnassus by level 50 or so. 40 for a human.
---
You see it every fucking WSG, you decide.
---
I like Desolace because you can actually spend two levels doing a lot of quests where STV has you coming in for a few quests, then leaving, coming back for a few more, leaving again etc
---
It’s spell batching, and it was put in place intentionally. The issue is the window that made artificial spell batching the way it is is just too large. If they reduce the window it’ll feel comfortable.
---
Again - density problem can be solved by making each layer as a standalone realm. But you will end up with lots of dead realms this way. Layering solves problem of dead realms, not density.
---
Roll an RP server.
---
My bad, I'll fix it thanks!
---
You should try playing on a popular private server. It was such a horrible experience that I quit playing the game.
---
Why
---
Not this time.
---
Dad? Is that you?
---
Either way its bullshit.
---
Anyone doing this isn't going to sell black lotus at launch. They will horde and horde and horde until phase 2 to take profit.
---
56 warrior tanking scholomance....yeah no way. Scholo is hands down the hardest level 60 instance
---
Resto druid stage 3 does not have 3 pc. Bonus which is incredibly valuable (15% extra spirit regen while casting).  I think it outweighs mishundares to get the storm rage cowl with that 3pc bonus in mind.
---
Great work though.  I appreciate you making this concise tool.
---
Hunter is the only class that can solo the elite rep quests, so that's a big plus.
---
(Other classes might be able to do it with uber gear, I dunno, but it's a lot easier on a hunter).
---
I named mine SCREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE.
---
put /petattack on all of my attacks.
---
Make pet scream entire dungeon.
---
It was one of the biggest classic updates we got recently.
---
I want a 2nd monitor so bad
---
I think my point is that someone having a rare mount also used to mean something from a community perspective, not just to the individual. People would swarm around you in front of the bank just because it was so cool to see. Even if they didn't know anything about it, how to get it, whatever. They knew it was special. Now rare mounts are just another gold star. Sure, another "collector" might recognize it's significance, but most of what makes them coveted today is getting that check mark in the mount collector achievement. Yawn.
---
perpetual day or night depending on play schedule
---
affects actual content like midnight salmon, people who play at night time get like 5% higher catch rate than me.  that's like 50% more profit from fishing than i get just because i play in the daytime.  heard there was something with trinkets in wod or legion idk about that tho.
---
guarantee there's even people out there who have no idea wow even has a day/night cycle
---
Not with Ooga Booga.

Heck, maybe the even got it from that one really popular MMO... what's it called...?

Ah yea, Real Life.

Open your launcher, click the drop down menu where your WoW accounts/ptr etc are, if you see "WoW: Classic Beta &amp; Stress test" then you have either the stress test access or beta. If you can login and servers are up it's beta, if not it's just the stress test.
---
Yes. First thing I am going to do, because:
---
- I got my tiger on two different characters back in ye good old Vanilla days
---
- Winterspring is my favourite zone
---
- (unpopular opinion) these repetitive quests are actually fun
---
- during previous attempts I got 2 epic world drops
---
I'm going to say I will, get set up and hyped to do it, do it for 20 minutes and never go back.
---
Mods can we get this pinned? We need to make sure this gains continuous attention so Blizz is forced to comment
---
guessing you are a retail player for sure
---
Warsong Lumber Mill pissed me off. Always went around looking for questgivers. Just as completely useless as the Goshek Farm in Arathi Highlands.

The insane was a good example of this. Wow kept some achievements that are very hard like this mount

Bold first post, Cotton.

Me and my son had them made for our first Blizzcon.

I still dont see how it helps you. If you raidframes display a 1000 missing health and you pick a 2000 health spell then having an AddOn to tell you that you overhealed wont make you a better player.

Yes. We got classic wow. That’s literally listening to the community.

 [https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Plainsrunning](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Plainsrunning)

I remember someone saying this, but maybe I'm either misremembering or they were simply wrong because plainsrunning was going to be in lieu of a mount so not until lvl 40 by which time the barrens would be irrelevant.
---
Yup - this is my experience as well.
---
&gt; Give me 1 world, All players in that world with all the upsides and downsides that come with it.
---
I mean... that's fine that you prefer that, but you're 1 person. The average player, even on classic, won't want to deal with the hassle of overcrowding in a questing based MMO, and Blizzard knows this. They have even talked about how while they want it to be the same game as it was, they still will make sure it's up to Blizzard standards as much as they can.
---
Also Vanilla WoW wasn't some super organic living-world MMO where you could do anything you thought up. It's always been a theme park mmo that was mainly about questing and instanced PvE. I think you're projecting your own desires in a game onto Classic, and then holding it to a standard that doesn't apply.
---
I am actually amazed at how many different zones existed but couldn't be reached in vanilla. If they do decide to add content to classic, they got plenty to work with.
---
Plunder isle itself would be too far out of the way then, since it neighbor's Kezan and Zandalar. Might be alright for some sideways expansion.
---
If the aesthetics dont do it for you, just wait until you remember there is one graveyard at the very southernmost part of the zone, and all the quests are done in the northern/northwestern part.
---
Then as a Horde, you're questing in an Alliance questgiver area.
---
The problem is, when they did that with Cataclysm quite a few people didn't like the expansion areas being so spread out.  I liked the new design in Cata, even though the Lore involved hasn't aged well, but it was one of the biggest complaints of the expac.
---
fair enough. 
---
could we at least get a link to one that exists added to community resources link? or just link a couple. unless there is a limit on that page as well.
---
So is Classic like starting fresh just like back in the day?  Nothing transfers over?
---
I'm  not sure where you are getting 120 hours but I think its longer.  That would add up to about 8,5 minutes per quest turn in, this includes running back and forth to the quest giver.
---
I don't think thats doable. The first quest with the meat isn't a guaranteed drop and the animals you need are scattered a bit.
---
The furbolg quest, a lot of the time not enough shamans will spawn and you need to kill and wait more than you need. It is also a quest hub so if people are doing their quests or anyone else is farming it you are fighting for kills or waiting longer.
---
The giant quest, don't bother with it.
---
Also epic riding is expensive, so a lot of people might start with the slow mount.
---
At least one server should remain pure classic, but if they launched new progressive servers I'd be down as long as it kept the vanilla spirit
---
I just hope his forum name is a lie.
---
by that logic, there's no point to getting BiS in any tier because you don't even need pre-BiS to finish any raid. heck you don't even need to level up just watch a streamer do the raids right? why even play an MMO? 
---
its BEST in slot, not welfare easymode strong items that are easy to get per slot.
---
The Auction House. Why? Its freaking easy, all you need is 1 Gold to start with and it will scale up quickly if you know what are you doing.
---
not having gold purchased in game, just means you can go to a certain website to buy gold for classic.
---
Isla Jaguar. That is all i will say for one of mine while leveling.
---
You didn't even fight for me. This relationship is so over.
---
Of course I am
---
&gt;Tried to argue with my GM at the time about it but to no avail xD
---
I mean, you didn't really have a choice if you wanted to deal damage.  Turns out hurling fireballs at a dude made of lava is rather pointless.
---
yeah that is a good point, I played on one with a 14k pop and I liked it.
---
Several points that you are presenting are just wrong.
---
1) Blizzard has stated time and time again that dead servers happen. They added servers in Classic, sure, because it was the first time the game came out. By TBC they already had extremely low pop servers that were not fun to play (I played on one, Zuluhed, it was an awful time).
---
2) That's not 75% of their playerbase, that's 75% of ONE server. People don't leave servers equally across all servers.
---
3) The difference is that your entire community changes overnight, it's not changing your name. The faction balance you were used to on the server? Drastically different. The people you see in the world/have to play with? Drastically different. These aren't bad when they trickle in by new players joining the server, but a server merge is all of these changes at once. It's extremely damaging to a community, anyone who has been through a server merge can attest to.
---
You aren't thinking through your argument enough, you are just seeing a few comments on Reddit and assuming what is bad about a server merge. I've been through one and hated it, and tons of others who have been through it feel the same.
---
If you play LoL I bet you're the top lane teemo that spams laugh all game

---
No it's not a direct violation. Wow isn't your safe space, please stop trying to make it so.
---
If you do 100% of the Darnassus rep quests you can get a kitty by level 50 or so.
---
Well this I did not know. That makes it all the more worthwhile.
---
No it isn't...
---
Oh cool, so could be 1/4 or 1/3, close to what private servers have afaik.
---
Lul.
---
ITT: people freaking out over beta test adjustment to server settings being changed.
---
If I don't really care about raiding, are there any really good reasons to choose warrior over druid for tanking?
---
Yeah right, having 3 instead of 1 rare mob/chest/spawn/herb/node/world boss per server is totally ok
---
I always did Silverpine from 12-14 and then went on to the Barrens. You can come back at level 17 or 18 and finish the zone.
---
I think these BIS lists shouldn't take into account availability of gear. I don't think enough cloth healing gear is going to drop to outfit every single healing class with bis cloth pieces... I think there should be a BIS for the armor type of the class and then BIS in general...
---
Horde for life!
---
yep KOS all gnomes !!
---
Cool. Report it and move on. Obviously this is a bug.
---
and then you sit around for hours to do the first quest in the zone because 100s of people are trying to do it, no thanks.
---
Oh totally. Was a very short and one sided debate shall we say 😂
---
I don't remember :(
---
I think they cost the same as a 60% mount but they are 100%.
---
But IIRC they don't need rep requirements, i.e. you can be an Orc not exalted with Forsaken and still ride that Horse.
---
I also don't know if you need epic riding for it. I do remember vaguely someone saying that theoretically you could ride those 100% mounts at level 58.
---
Just happened again.
---
Layering is great :)
---
I want to know the secrets too!
---
IMHO they really messed up the islands, there should have beem  south seas expansion, kul tiras and zandalar should have been 1 zone each, as well as kezan, plunder isle, tel'abim, and the broken isles (could still be 5 zones, but would have broken it into more of an archipelago), najatar and the maelstrom

Each layer is literally another instance of the world server. They're spun up dynamically on VMs. You can only run X number of VMs on each blade. If you want more VMs running simultaneously you need more blades. 
---
Hence: more layers requires more hardware (in aggregate).
---
The alternative to layering is not one VM with more people. The alternative is queues. The architecture is never going to move back to one instance of the world server per blade. Even if they get rid of layering, the game will still be VMs on virtual hardware because that's just how internet servers work now because it lets you seamlessly upgrade hardware without impacting the software.
---
I already did it twice back then (because I switched mains) and definitely intend to do it a third!
---
&gt; adding race selection on all warrior stages
---
Can you add hunter (trolls and dwaves) and rogue (same as warrior sans orc) races as well?
---
How dare people beta test things.
---
Why not?
---
I'll be waiting!
---
Ahhh Silkroad Online.  Killing so MANY white tigers.  I think I made it to level 20 before I started botting.  I would wake up in the middle of the night to check my bot, and if I was stuck on a tree I would get soooo pissed! Back to sleep, check on the bot before school, come home, check on the bot....
---
What a glorious game lol
---
Yep, that was the awesome part.  I got it before I was 60.
---
Nothing at all transfers over from retail. It's a completely separate game.
---
😎
---
Supposedly, but there are reports of people wall jumping in WSG to get behind bases.

This right here! You will somehow have to return from Durotar to Mulgore, Bloodhoof Village to be specific. There are no flight paths directly to these places meaning you have to walk to a capital city (or Crossroads) and fly to Thunder Bluff. From TB it is about a 5min walk to Bloodhoof Village.
---
All this time spent traveling would have gained you a few levels if you wouldn’t have made the trip. And ask yourself, would your friends stop leveling during your traveling? If not, this means you will loose ground on them and you will have to catch up with them somehow. 
---
That’s why I suggest Crossroads is the perfect rendezvous point to start your journey as a team.
---
Yes! People either forget or never heard about the Monkeynews mining node issue too. Its not good.
---
they are illusional, should be taken to the infirmary
---
you should listen to the interview before you use it as a source for anything

so many bugs.... I just don't see them having Classic ready by August 27th

High pop no layering only works with dynamic respawn.

Lmao imagine what this guy looks like in real life.

Dw/Defiance is the best tanking spec in the game. Private servers have proven it so. Aside from maybe having 8/8 T3 but even then i bet the fury tanking will out threat the Shield Slam full prot.

Would you prefer to battleground in an environment that was balanced around battlegrounds?

OR

actually parallels very well to what is happening in the real world. turn your population gay and race-mix them to weaken them so they're easier to control.

That's a pretty good idea. Do we know if those repeatable turn-in quests for rep are going to be in during phase 1 / 2?
---
Would've made a nice grounded adventure, if we weren't fighting the biggest threats known to the world expansion after expansion. The only problem I can see here is all the loading screen in between these one zone isles.

 I want to raid through naxx this time.   I can't decide which hybrid I want to play.   Feral Tank Druid, Elemental Shaman, mage, and holy paladin.   I want to be able to aoe farm for gold too.  I might try a bit of PVP on the side too, but that isn't my main focus.  I am unsure what to do.  I am also kind of a loot whore, so I want to gear up fast.   5 mans are a lot harder to set up, if you are a healer, and nigh impossible as a dps.  3 DPS LF a tank and healer isn't LFM, they're LFG.
---
Mage is the best at aoe farming,.  But paladin seems interesting for that as well, and alliance is ez mode.
---
Feral tank druid would fulfill my loot whore desires.  Makes 5 man groups really easy, if you are a tank.  
---
Elem Shaman would just be fun to blow people up in pvp again like the good ol' days.
---
Wait a minute, the Kazzak spawn point in retail is now... green? 😑
---
I can do it again.
---
Heard it only happens if you are in a group, but definitely a bug.
---
I didn’t get it. I’ll never get my answer.
---
Scandinavian here - I didn't catch any sarcasm at all.
---
You haven't played WoW enough to understand the joke, but if you say so.
---
One of the emulated realms I played on would periodically reset the world--specifically they would fire up a new server and you could either play that or stick around. I hope Blizzard does something similar--progress to TBC once everybody's *actually* had time to play Naxx but fire up a new Vanilla realm so people can still play the original game.
---
there is no Kazzak in retail
---
The thing about needing the old blades they auctioned was just a joke Blizzard made when they announced Classic. The joke being how silly/absurd such a thing would be.
---
Because you've got some #NoChanges idiots who will REEE all day and night if they were to do that.
---
wish we would just get dynamic spawning instead much less disruptive imo and has been working well on all the pservers ive played on.
---
This is just epic!
---
Sorry but you sound like you’re not a very good healer. :(
---
What, you think there’s some guy in a dark room hand picking all the invites by dim lamp light, tears streaming down his face from the hunger pangs while he watches the sun come and go day after night after day out of a small, wrought iron barred window in the corner of his cell? I’d rather imagine it’s just random. Seems a little easier to me.
---
YES I’ve been saying this for so long so glad to see someone else saying it!
---
It's very good for PvP. Only downside is you OOM fast.
---
Mail armor+shield, purge strips 2 buffs, 11% crit chance from talents, -1sec cast time on lightning bolt and chain lightning from talents, 6sec CD interrupt, huge burst damage, your warrior and rogue friend will love you for windfury totem, grounding totem is great, tremor totem has no CD, and your heals are effective.
---
Some of them are, like the morrowgrain quest and the un'goro soil one. The cloth turn-in quests aren't until a later phase.
---
ITT: people think beta means release ready. 
---
“Psh there’s a bug in the beta 11 weeks from release?! No way they will be ready” 
---
Meanwhile other games are in “beta” for years and you still put up with it. Stop acting like no game outside of WoW had bugs.
---
Play on an RP server and play it all.
---
You are embellishing. The game is playable as is.
---
No, that is not the definition of oxymoron, and he wasn't contradicting himself.
---
This guy druids.
---
This is indeed the level of discourse one can expect from a self-admitted pedophile. I even provided a source, but you're still trying to deflect because your mental delusions clearly know better.
---
Get help, before it's too late.
---
Absolutely agree, however 5% on such low quantities as when you're leveling.. Def shouldn't be a deciding factor on your choice of race imo
---
Just out of curiousity what do people have against dynamic respawn? I don’t mean to the point of instant spawns but some reasonable middle ground for very high pop in the same area/zone.
---
Madseason is great
---
ok, cool.  Haven't played since MoP but I'm thinking about going back for this.  I played release to Mists and then stopped.
---
awesome! I appreciate all the work it takes to do this.
---
Oh, what is it then?
---
I'm all a fan for the creation of new zones implemented with Phases or after Naxx.
---
Druid or shaman will be the easiest to form groups with as duos, since they can heal. Druid especially, since you'd be able to tank as well, and they could work very well for a duo with warlock since they'd be able to go more of a shred build and synergise extremely well with the resource management on locks.
---
One thing to consider, in US they're releasing game on a Monday. Tuesday is always server maintenance day. There will be a forced break after about 15 hours for at least a couple. 
---
The real hardcore might just go shower and eat during that time, though some will probably try and sleep during those couple hours and start again after nap.
---
got any more of them *trading sticks*?
---
33 now, was in college when wow came out. The smartest thing I’ve done is get my girlfriend into gaming by building her a gaming PC. She is really good at overwatch and I’m hoping I can get her to pick up wow. 
---
Now the only problem is figuring out how to navigate around work.
---
What’s going to be really fun is *actually* sniping these guys.  I have a feeling their minds are going to simply implode.
---
What I think is most important is that kids that are 14 years younger than we are have a chance to waste away their life on this wonderful game.
---
Sry months ;
---
What did it say? It has been deleted. I hate the mods!
---
The whole point of getting BiS is spamming dungeons until you get it.
---
If he puts the "second best" in there it's not really a BiS list anymore
---
The so and so has donated $2 appearing right after he smashes his head is hilarious.
---
It seems like a pretty apt description of people who are believing what was said instead of what is actually happening in reality.
---
This isn't similar at all though. I was referring to Blizzard, not a random stranger on the street. They aren't kidnapping me simply by buying classic. Heck even if they try identity theft, they already have the same info from just the battle.net login stuff. Classic doesn't make me more susceptible to anything other than Blizzard manages to get $15 a month because I resubscribed. I mean I guess there's the threat that classic wow is just ransonware that will fuck your computer if you don't pay, but why? Of course a business's top priority is to make money, it's how they stay a business, so why care if they're just releasing classic for money? they released all their other games for money.
---
Ideally, yes, but some realms will be at risk of having months of layering, which will completely ruin the experience. There'll be no way to know beforehand which realms will or will not be affected by it for months.
---
What did it say??? the dumb ass mods deleted it
---
I grinded this beauty in Vanilla and I didn’t even replace it with the Amani War Bear I got in BC.
---
They could just keep the Vanilla realm intact and allow you to clone yourself onto the new TBC server.
---
That private server that split itself into 2 servers (Yet labeled itself as 1 and 3) made a huge mistake and only baiting newbies to their dead server by listing it as a higher population in the realm list.
---
"layering"[](https://imgflip.com/i/33ebj7)
---
That's not his point. His point is that if private servers cobbled together by random people on the internet could handle 15k people, Blizzard pretending they need sharding for 5k people is absolute nonsense.
---
&gt;Blizzard has stated time and time again that dead servers happen. They added servers in Classic, sure, because it was the first time the game came out. By TBC they already had extremely low pop servers that were not fun to play (I played on one, Zuluhed, it was an awful time).
---
How long did it take for the first WoW server to die?
---
&gt;That's not 75% of their playerbase, that's 75% of ONE server. People don't leave servers equally across all servers.
---
Ok the example was talking about the server. For that specific point, I was talking about the server. That was a mistake on my part. I can see where if it was the playerbase an entire server could possibly leave. Albeit rare; possible.
---
&gt;The difference is that your entire community changes overnight, it's not changing your name. The faction balance you were used to on the server? Drastically different. The people you see in the world/have to play with? Drastically different. These aren't bad when they trickle in by new players joining the server, but a server merge is all of these changes at once. It's extremely damaging to a community, anyone who has been through a server merge can attest to.
---
Ok but this is months and months and months down the line, your server by your own words is dead at this point but you are concerned about the community changing? What community? Your server was supposedly dead. This makes no sense to me.
---
&gt;It's extremely damaging to a community, anyone who has been through a server merge can attest to.
---
I have merged servers multiple times on multiple MMOs. Never had an issue with it. I had to change my name a few times. That's about it.
---
&gt;You aren't thinking through your argument enough, you are just seeing a few comments on Reddit and assuming what is bad about a server merge. I've been through one and hated it, and tons of others who have been through it feel the same.
---
I've been through many, and it was never a big deal. I have known people who have had characters literally deleted though. To the point it took literal days to get a character back. Would he hate merging? Probably, he had a bad experience with it. Many people have. Many people have had bad experiences with sharding. The difference is that merging is done once the game has reached a state where it is dead, sharding/layering is done at a point where the game is most alive. You don't want layering when you have it, and when you no longer have layering the server is dead so who cares?.
---
r/theydidthemath

Since it's a BiS list I guess it wouldn't make sense for them :p

Take the boat to menethil harbor then swim the coast line all the way to westfall and then probably die to murlocs

Wonder how it’ll compare to getting exalted with Darnassus. IIRC that’s about 1500g factoring in the Runecloth and mount cost.
---
because the streamers will create a list of "blacklisted" players for the other faction to not include those players in their raids etc etc

If you don't need pre BiS then you shouldn't be using a pre-BiS site
---
Keep in mind. Horde has Tremor Totem for Fear effects. This negates the need for Fear Ward. That is why Horde can do fine in Raids without it.
---
Why would they delete it. Now it just looks suspicious AF. It's like they want there to be conspiracies floating around. 
---
He just said they are only giving us what they want but will turn around and screw us over. Honestly it wasn't the most insane theory in the world now that we've seen 60 boost questions in the survey.

I learned about wow from a friend and he never told me about quests giving experience so I just ran around killing mobs to lvl till about 14 when I realized quests gave exlerience
---
Of course! Dont let those meta slaves tell you something else. Its also About Fun right?
---
Since they're isles there's still space for them just above this one
---
Was raiding a few years back and joined a new guild. Few weeks in the guild leader mentioned he lived in IL. Turns out we lived (he's moved) in the same town and he worked right up the street at the university. Small world.
---
&gt; Congrats, you earned that downvote
---
It’s honestly gonna be a waste of your time. Don’t get me wrong, running dungeons is fun, and great xp (especially if you have related quests) but by the time the people going hard are hitting cap you’ll be at like level 40 at best. Your best at would be a mix of quests and dungeons. Then again, if you don’t care about how quick you take to level then fuck it, so what you want! There are some fun, well written quests in classic though, you’d be missing out!
---
I love it. We must protect barbarella at all costs
---
if makes changes = remove then sure
---
if not we're gonna keep seeing stuff like this.
---
I mean in order to get BiS gear you have to go in as a pretty under geared enhancement shaman. And if you’ve found a guild willing to take you to get that gear, I’m sure they would continue to let you raid with them once you’ve gotten better gear lol
---
The BIS list encompasses all phases of raid gear not just dungeons...
---
Much like deku, in order for a low level warrior to attack, you must break your arms
---
Unless, ya know, the anger is fully justified
---
If you walked by a blizzard employee they would be a stranger on the street. Nobody is saying it's ransomware. They are saying they will put microtransactions/account services into classic slowly. 
---
I don't think they will either, but others seem convinced. I'm convinced that would absolutely ruin classic and they won't do that.
---
I feel like it's conditioning at this point.  So many games "release" in pre-alpha, to alpha these days.  Hell, people think Beta is full on release material and 1.0 is just a unicorn.
---
I heard this will get fixed quickly as if it does work then it also stacks with all the consumables you can get for sp, will be insanely op
---
&gt;just using a flask
---
There's no melee DPS flask, and flasks aren't "just".
---
I think Naxx-BiS enh is about as good as BWL-BiS semi-slacking 2h fury. This guess is a bit random though. 
---
What I'm almost sure about that, if an *equally geared* 2h/1h fury or rogue loses the DPS race to enh, that 2h/1h fury or rogue is a complete slacker and has bleeds in his rotation.
---
Yeah I guess so, but in the concept  the bay is much bigger, you could do another version
---
Wouldn’t the same apply to warrior?
---
Storm wind forever. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve ran between the MB in front of the bank to the AH. Pretty sure I have more time there than every other city combined (to include Dalaran/Shat.)

What is layering? I'm seeing it all over reddit.
---
once method has cleared through all of the content within a day of it being released the crying for WÆÆÆÆÆÆÆÆH THERE IS NO ENDGAME REEE REEE will begin. 
---
Bliz has said they're open for futher development of vanilla. I hope it would be done under a runescape type voting system though. 70% of people gotta agree on it being done before developing starts.
---
I am all for certain stuff getting "fixed" but it will wound up being a completely different game. Though i dont think some simple talent tree reworks will change it tooo much (personally i would like to play shammy tank, simply rearranging some talents here and there will make that easier)
---
How the fuck did I even do that in vanilla? Jesus christ.
---
This thread is gold!
---
There are already 3 or 4 podcasts that have really, really good content.  Countdown to Classic is probably the best one.  The others are ran by streamers and have streamers on them.  That's cool and all, but CtC has actual interviews with knowledgeable people that are actual contributors to the WoW community.  The most recent episode had John Staats who was a dungeon designer for Vanilla and designed BRD.  It also had a sitting member with one of Maine's Congressmen to talk about the one time WoW got mixed up in politics.  The show is actually excellent.  
---
They take people in their Discord to actually talk on the show.  That's mostly hit, but can miss if the person isn't as knowledgeable or can't articulate properly.  They got it down pretty well now and it's mostly great content. 
---
https://countdowntoclassic.com/
---
Your site is awesome
---
&gt;Merging servers, queues and dynamic spawning
---
All of that sounds awful to me.
---
Human Dwarves like Female Females
---
There would be so many resources being poured into a sub-optimal DPS slot (hand of rag, etc) that your weight in the guild would mainly be leadership, friend, etc- to show you are contributing besides the lack of DPS up until that point you're talking about.
---
At that point... I'm sure you'd be able to pull moderate dps, falling somewhere in the middle, but a BiS enh shaman still lacks the tools to beat out even ok geared mages, warlocks, rogues, warriors.
---
He asked if Enh could be competitive, so your answer is an outright lie. Enhancement shamans do very bad DPS.
---
Blizzard has no balance plans for Classic at all. What worked in 1.12 will work in Classic. It's still not better than Windfury Totem.
---
Oh and you can also summon people near a cliff to kill them
---
Best class ever
---
SonyDigital - twitch.tv/sonii he’s super chill, has a friendly community, and is almost constantly streaming
---
you realise he is a horde player right? versus alliance children.... it's not hard to win those pvp duels lol
---
I mean they have been working on it for over a year and a half now. I doubt it will end up being like that when it launches, don't get me wrong, but I can see why people are worried
---
layering is gone before the end of phase 1. it's only for handling populations in low level zones during release
---
Fine, agreed, but I still wish I could buy my way into the beta and I'm sure I'm not the only one, hence the joke.
---
No, because any other pure dps class would still do more with the same gear and commitment.
---
I'm planning on trying and then giving up after a couple hours
---
it will most likely be active for entire phase 1, im guessing it will be active atleast 2 months which is more than enough to ruin a lot of pvp etc.
---
Repost!

Servers cost money to run. Its monetarily inefficient to buy or rent servers in prediction of a load that isn't accurate you need and to not use them in the end because you were wrong. What is efficient is to run what you can and once your load stabilizes, you can then buy or rent what you need to get to capacity.
---
I believe Layering is going away, whether its because the population dies out fast or because it stays and they get more servers doesn't matter.
---
Hop on a retail server, you'll love it!

"Stuck"
---
But I can see you're fully capable of jumping and running in various directions!
---
"Very much stuck."
---
They need layering so new players can actually level up in the starting zones uncontested. Maybe they can turn off layering 2 weeks or have layering only for low level players.
---
Wasn’t blasted lands originally quite swampy much like swamp of sorrows (basing this on the black morass dungeon) so wouldn’t it have a bit more of remnants / transition of swampland more than a coastal extension of STV?
---
That pic is great
---
&gt;Merging servers
---
So layering with more steps?
---
Not in the beginning :) learn your facts.
---
Well tbh I never really thought about that haha
---
There's a difference between a company making money and being greedy. The reason we're getting Classic is because of how many players dislikes retail. And greed played a role in why retail is the way that it is.
---
PepeLaugh
---
no use your brain
---
Just gotta accept that it will take months to hit 60.
---
&gt; it will most likely be active for entire phase 1
---
I share your concerns, but we still can be optimistic, can't we. Blizz said that they'll try to get rid of it as soon as they can.

Then imo it just depends on the guild. If they are willing to let one of their healers switch to a not so optimal dps class. Me personally, if you know mechanics and can avoid standing in fire I’d take you no matter what class/spec you are lol

I seriously doubt we will EVER see new content for Classic. It'll be TBC-Classic or they'll figure out a way to convert everyone from Classic to Retail (they're planning a huge level squish for Retail).
---
If by do it you mean kill him over and over again to make the grind harder for alliance, yes.
---
I think people are just noticing differences.  They're small.  It's not a big deal if that's how classic actually was and not what they got from private servers.
---
That would be cool too. It's not so much the mechanism I care about as it is the opportunity for people to experience the progression of the game again.
---
hell nah
---
You can tank as a dps spec and with a 2 hander for all dungeons except up to brd. The biggest reason why its inefficient is waiting on grouos to travel to the inctance. If you run an instance once and ghe group disbands and you try to find another group to run the instance again its a huge time sink to find replacements and then wait for them to get there. If you can find a guild or grouo that isndedicated to grinding instances all day it really isnt bad for leveling efficiency whatsoever. The problem is finding those who would match your play schedule
---
Capped out at 2 minutes
---
I mean, I can understand people being frustrated, but fully justified would require the game to actually be released. It's in a beta state. You can't fully justify something that's still being worked on.
---
You can point to other areas where Blizzard has done a poor job with beta issues, BFA, that doesn't necessarily mean the same will happen here. This doesn't mean optimism is the wrong opinion just because you've been burned more than someone else.

entitled streamer....
---
Oh come on, I've seen so many noob Paladins who think that Robes of Volatile Power is BiS, don't give them any ideas! 
---
I don't understand how this whole thing started, but as anyone knows who has done their own attribute weight calculations: don't go for that robe as a Paladin. 
---
Robes of the Exalted is what you're going to want to use all the way to AQ.
---
For some reason many Paladin BiS lists overvalue crit and mp5. You're already so efficient as a Paladin, if your guild is good then you won't have mana issues anyway. Just focus on making your heals as big as possible.
---
Of course there are item slots where it's really close, so you can have one set with mp5/crit for longer fights and another set for shorter fights, but there's no reason to compete with casters for that crit robe when your pre-bis robe is slightly better anyway.
---
I would prefer that but it wont happen. Even with layering only in low lvl zones, leveling would be super annoying with 6min spawn timers on release with high-mid pop
---
the black dragon whelps in redridge (and yeah, I play pve servers).
---
They are on the short list of mobs that drop cash that you can skin. and dragonkin have relatively low armor: a typical mob for this level would have about 700 armor, topping out in the 900's for really tanky stuff like crawlers, and these guys have ~400. They have moderate health for their level: well below bears, more than spiders, but not by a huge amount. 
---
They don't have a super exploitable attack interval, unlike say, moonstalker sires (who can be hamstring kited pretty mercilessly), but You can LOS their fireballs behind the trees there, and their 3 second cast, combined with their need to reposition and then cast again, means that you can actually get a full bandage rotation off while you are fighting them, which is really nice for warriors. 
---
They are also at the level where you start getting enough points in tactical mastery that stance dancing for the interrupt is practical, if you don't have a convenient tree. 
---
Of course, on a mature pvp server, this is asking to get wrecked.
---
Probably an unpopular opinion, but how do people stand watching this guy?
---
Esports jerseys made for a guild is a great idea!
---
You can tank as a warrior with a dps spec, and they're a lot better in pvp.
---
Keep doing gods work.
---
I dunno, I played during those inconveniences and never once felt hopeless. YMMV.

You want to get a shaman decked out in enhance gear? Be a resto shaman and wait.

Haven't seen it posted here, so just sharing my favorite cover of the song.
---
what do you mean its only for handling populations in low level zones, it will be active in end game zones aswell -&gt; raids being next to each other on different layers in ungoro, jumping realms for tidal charm, devilsaur, black lotus, its fking retarded.
---
In Vanilla I played a priest and raided hardcore (5 raid nights a week with the last 2 being optional 20 man raid days!). I healed though MC and BWL, but then actually managed to raid as shadow in BWL and content after that, which was pretty new at the time! That said, I never had any gold, I had very little time ti farm outside raid hours and any gold I made went towards pots and flasks. When I began raiding shadow I acquired gear that helped me farm, but as a healing priest, it was real tough. That said, I never had any issues finding a group for instances! I also leveled up a Rogue and Mage which I  used in raids we had on farm.
---
This time, I'll be going Mage as my main. As much as I enjoyed healing, and I did find it super satisfying, I just want to have an easier time leveling/farming and am looking forward to raiding without as much responsibility! Although I know finding groups/raid spots is a bit more competitive as a DPS!

And people wonder why the subscription numbers are so low for retail WoW...
---
#r00fles!
---
...No, that's not quite right.  The link request was prompted by /u/EpicHuggles saying:
---
&gt;You're joking right? That clip of the female streamer rage quitting .... was entirely driven by them corpse camping her.
---
Even though the reason for the request wasn't specifically stated, we can infer from context that they're asking to verify if the streamer was getting corpse camped, because that's what /u/EpicHuggles was claiming.
---
thats a really dumb mindset imo, much better to call out the huge issues with layering and try to find other solutions
---
Well look, the only reason they came up with layering is because of the obvious and near unanimous backlash from the classic community. I would say continuing to express that outrage when layering behaves in a way that is beyond what we assumed or want the scope of it to be is necessary.
---
It would be silly if these things kept happening and we all just sat around muttering to ourselves about how it's a beta and it'll probably get fixed. Blizzard has demonstrated the opinion of the community is very important, so we're ensuring they see that opinion, because layering is probably the one make or break issue that is sill unresolved.
---
Yes you can't "out consume" a real dps class because they have access to the same consumables. I guess if they all handicap themselves on purpose..
---
nope
---
&gt; I mean is someone who is going to play long term wont care they cant play day 1.
---
False. Most die hard gamers are going to want to level to 60 as quickly as possible.
---
&gt; Lose intrest from who?
---
Literally anyone playing at launch
---
Apparently everyone and their mother have this book and I simply can’t find anywhere to buy. D:
---
why is any of those worse than layering, have you played or watched any gameplay with these.
---
Oh lmao just saw your comment
---
actually blizz has been pretty kind to exploiters or even hackers i think.
---
when i was 10yo i got to westfall on an alt and i was like "wonder how much xp i'd get from exploring all of this?" 
---
so i started cheat engine and sped up the game, i was astonished the server didnt need to verify my location cause i ran across the zone and even lvld up from doing it.
---
Got a 24 hour ban a couple minutes later i seem to remember... was at the end of tbc atleast. I dont remember if they reset my lvl haha
---
You are worth about two things as an enhancement shaman in raids. My guild is bringing one for the main tank group and he will have a nightfall. But he won't be doing competitive dps, he will be pressing windfury totem, followed by GOA totem. then waiting  9 seconds and repeating the process. To answer your question Ehancement is not a DPS spec it is a meme, no amount of gear can make it a good spec.

---
Do you not want active discussion on issues that could affect classic? Like even if you disagree, talking about things is good, is it not? Don't click the thread if you don't want to participate?
---
Youre going to have to include more grinding to offsert the shared kill xp that joannas guide does nkt account for. Also some quests will not be as woerthwhile to do because of the lower drop rates and in those cases you would also need to opt for grinding in order to make up for that xp difference.
---
Ah. I can't play male Tauren as a tank, I never see what I'm tanking, love my cow though. And I only tank normal dungeons, only got to tank a raid once.
---
Even during Vanilla, MANY players considered leveling a chore and end game raiding or Battlegrounds were the only thing they were interested in.
---
Yea, I always found it stupid these unquestionable BiS list, need more options, for Holy priest at least. So many items are so equal in "value", depending on spec and play style and understand of the game. To say: "you have to get these items, especially when chest on (Holy Priest) list is tailoring epic pattern, that will cost prolly over 300g to buy, if you aren't lucky, and crafting another 300, for a tiny upgrade over a blue drop. Another 3 on that list are random stats items, and are VERY difficult to get and roll correct stats.
---
No but I'll be sure to gank those that are trying.
---
Just because there are no flasks that increase melee damage doesn’t mean there aren’t melee flasks. Flask of Titans is an overall DPS increase because you have the ability to ignore mechanics in favor of DPS with more health. Flask of Supreme Power is an amazing consumable for melee to use in combination with Dragonbreathe Chili and other spell power consumables.

Boomer who doesnt even know about the boomer meme.

I was already not a virgin anymore at the time, there was no reason to get a virginity protector.

No, *that*'s not quite right. Sentence structure pretty clearly dictates that the subject was "that clip of the female streamer rage quitting".
---
Thus the response "Do you have a link [to that clip of the female streamer rage quitting]?
---
That's not what my experience in beta showed, however that may be down to lag.
---
That’s the retail link
---
same lol

Nice write-up it helped me quite a bit. Can you be fury as an OT or do you need to be prot?

Holy shit. I was thinking worst-case a few weeks.

no, not casters, and not for stat minmaxing.

For groups, yes, but they'll be significantly worse for leveling. If you are going to duo with a warr or rogue, you really want to pair with a class that can heal. Locks and hunters aren't the *worst*, since they can still mitigate a lot of dmg with their pets, but you'll either have to be pretty careful about pulling aggro or get slowed down by their healing downtime.
---
In short, yep.
---
Hand of Rag isn’t a PvE weapon. It is almost entirely a PvP/meme weapon. Giving it to your enhance really doesn’t waste any resources so long as he actually uses it.
---
that's correct. sharding can fuck right off, no place for it at all.
---
The fact you can't instantly recognize how this could be exploited in PvE &amp; PvP says a lot about your intelligence
---
I will try.
---
I see the concept here, but isn't a large layered server the same as a bunch of small pop servers? At the end of the day you're not seeing all the people playing.
---
it's going to take the vast majority of people 1-2 months to get to level 60. low level zones are more densely populated than higher level zones. as players level up they tend to move into different directions/zones. i wouldn't be concerned if i were you, but you do you
---
Maybe it's because I"m disabled and used to not being able to play long hours (not able to sit up that long) but I'll just enjoy the long slow climb. I'm not a huge end game player anyway anymore though so that makes it easier on me. I think for me personally since I'm not going to be all about that BiS must have raiding gear I might enjoy it more this time around anyway :)
---
Yep, if your guild is casual and don't care about individual performance it will be fine. Guilds that care will require raid specs though.
---
Nope just trying to remind you that there were servers that launched and died down to barely having 4 raiding guilds on each side.
---
for some reason I was crazy enough to grind this on Nostalrius PvE with priest and got to 15k before the server shut down... I wanna farm this once classic hits for sure but this tme with a mage haha

It's fighting a windmill IMO. Blizzard is a multibillion company, and I'm pretty sure we can't make them scrap their decision. 
---
But calling out huge issues and asking to improve the system is what we can and should do.
---
LOK'TAR OGAR BRÖTHER
---
Man, I really don't want blizz to screw up vanilla, but it honestly seems like they are very quickly going to screw it up if they go with this.
---
Layering is not vanilla and is 100% changes. Where the hell are all the people who were here at first SHOUTING #nochanges?
---
If layering goes through and it is here to stay I may have to seriously reconsider if I will be returning or if I'll find some pserver that is going to launch a new actually #nochanges vanilla server.
---
Jesus Christ you're stupid.
---
What a nonsensical relation.  You're talking a slight nuance that gives an insignificant advantage and you jump to store hours on dungeons?? Ok?  The game is full of it with RNG, class imbalance, and even faction imbalance.  I'm guessing a lot of things in this game upset you.
---
Isn't there a guy for each faction that lets you turn off XP gains for your toon? Why not just do that?
---
oof, a good argument to go human
---
Rings for Phase 6 Feral tanks are wrong imo. Dark Iron is a good ring to be sure, but Signet of the Fallen Defender https://classicdb.ch/?item=23018 is better imo. More stam, more armor, and only trade 5 def for 1% hit, which is important for a tank
---
The amount of people that are going to play on release is going to be outrageously more than whatever you played with back in the day. To think that not being able to do any quests or even grind mobs makes the game “fun” is just stupid.
---
Agree. Dont compare yourself to the speedrun neckbeards, just enjoy taking your time leveling
---
I saved up my PTO for this. I can go hard at the beginning, the initial race to 60 is one of my personal favorite parts. Endgame is a marathon, not a race.
---
you also accept the risk of your account being closed by doing so.  It's considered cheating and people's accounts get banned for this.  Is it likely you'll get banned?  Probably not.  But people do get banned for this and it's a matter of is the risk + $$$ worth the gold..  For me it's always been no.  I'd rather farm and earn the gold and buy things I earned why would I pay to skip content in vanilla and also have an added chance to get banned, lol.
---
I think this is key. People actually complained about achievements being added that they couldn’t accomplish, for instance. Like just because it was in there they should be entitled to do it. 
---
The philosophy here was if you spent a few hours a week you could get it over time. Or, no life it and grind away. There was no pretense that they gave a fuck. You just put in something cool, make it very hard, and by that design the item becomes rare automatically.
---
BG's where crossrealm after they removed the old honor system. Xrealm BG's dont work with the vanilla honor system.
---
ill never played anything with monks in it. going back to pservers if thats the case
---
The problem with TBC is its a more refined vanilla, but, you lose incredibly much content. nobody will run mc, aq, naxx etc. also everyone will hang out in shattrath?... gay.
---
Also bubbleboys on horde side? gay.
---
Yup.
---
I have no problems with the server cap, that's their job to decide it how high it'll be. Just watch Tipsout's or StaysafeTV's interview video. Blizzard said that they want layering because it'll eliminate the queues and the server load for a smoother experience. Like I said they should layer only the starting zones or 1-20 or no layering at all and everyone will be happy.
---
You are gold!
---
if you're ignoring items that are rare or drop as random rollsthen this is not a bis list, you should include these items because people will farm them regardless of how rare it is or not, wands being obtainable through monetary means and ironfoes from sheer dedication to lava runs.
---
I thought 14% parry chance for bosses might make this a nono since most private servers were running lower parry chance on bosses.

---
\^ this
---
I feel sorry for your raid if you think a flask of titans means you can ignore mechanics.
---
There are 425 mounts in the game and you get your first at level one. The entire game is a participation trophy.
---
This is such an early stage of wow he’s just talking about where their mind went.
---
To be fair it was Sodapoppin brainchild.
---
I think player houses could work if they weren't instanced. Imagine if there were maybe 20 per server and they were allocated in a certain way, like a fun community challenge. Every 3 months. It could have an auction house representative, some convenience items, and allow for cosmetic changes. Be a cool hub and status symbol.
---
I'll be rolling Tauren Shaman in Classic. I like all 3 races and I have been back and forth on which I will play. The final tiebreaker was the fact that a Tauren Shaman was in the original WoW cinematic. Just prefer them class fantasy wise I guess.
---
Private servers have no loot table data so they are largely made up from memory. We’ll all find out real drop rates after classic hits
---
Mhm, but there are still going to be other players interested in it, and only 1 guild member at a time can work towards it. That means whoever is working towards it has to have the "pull" of the guild behind them.
---
Yeah I'll be doing it solo. About the streaming, my ultimate goal would be to stream everything (not shower, toilet ofc) but even when I'm asleep so I have a proof that I havent left the lounge. Not sure about Twitch's TOS if that will be possible tho. :D
---
&gt; These coming classic servers are projected to be huge, plenty of guilds to go around.
---
Projected by whom?  You know the reason that Blizzard is doing layering?   Because the population will drop off massively in the first few months.  We are talking like 90% of the people that make a character will be inactive in classic.
---
It was the other way around on the server I played back then. It's all in the faction balance of the server in question. Since they'll be using cross-realm queues it shouldn't matter much.
---
EQs day night cycle wasn't synchronized to Earth time. A full 24 hour period was 72 minutes.
---
I didn't play DAOC but my understanding is that it similar to EQ.
---
Why Tauren for ele and resto?
---
Got the explorer title on my level 10 before achievements were account bound. Took ages lol
---
Yes, it still doesn't change what I said.
---
Absolutely not
---
When you fail grabbing karma from asmongolds hillbilly-viewership.
---
Nah. The purple tint looks awful.
---
Battle beetle from AQ trash is the holy grail
---
Wowhead can help you search for alternative items if you have the time to comb through it all. It has unique search filters that you can select to help expedite things further.
---
Note that in some examples, an item may provide a flat percent increase to a stat. This may be unmatched in subsequent armor pieces of the same type, so knowing the stat values you are trying to reach over all becomes more important when it comes to stacking things like hit %.
---
Half of the fun in this game is knowing which stats to build around and then making it happen on your own through exploration and unlocking different types of loot.
---
Crossroads is under attack.
---
Some other game allowed you to swap "layers", I think it was Tera. It was shitty because people could jump layers at will to avoid PvP.
---
Man if do go the 1.13 route instead of bc I would love for these to be editions to the game. I always felt like there were too little pirate stuff.
---
This proves nothing. It’s evidence of nothing. He logged over and back and saw another player in an online game. Again, “wow”. 
---
WOOOOOOOOWWWWWW
---
Try harder.
---
Yeah but maybe some of us aren't looking to grovel at the feet of these NPCs like they're some comic book heroes?  That's the mentality of later WoW.  I'm fine with them looking exactly as bland as other NPCs because I don't relate to their stories in that comic book way that other people seem to.
---
My condolences, you think private servers are harder.
---
a moment of silence please.
---
Give the Scarlet Citadel a port so it makes sense that it exists.
---
As I see it they would starve in 3 days considering how isolated they're.
---
Also didn't Stratholme have a port and an exit towards Northeron?
---
Sort of. 
---
Whelps have modest cash holdings (nothing special), but instead of carrying cloth, they carry some other white items: noteworthy are sharp and wicked claws and flame sacs. These are very relevant for casting (less the sharp claws, which makes out of date rage potions, than the wicked claws, which make lionheart helms). Their grey items are not particularly high value, and probably, I suspect, below average. But the databases do not record the times a beast drops nothing, so the competitor for grey items, beasts, do not have accurate data to my knowledge. 
---
They get a big bump though because they are some of the more exploitable mobs in the game due to being low armor spellcasters, and they are mobs that drop cash that you can skin. 
---
They also take up very little bag space, as they don't drop cloth and they drop relatively few grey items and not particularly high value ones, I don't think. Also, items like the flame sac are very low drop chance items that stack in reasonable quantity: you can kill, on average, 100 crimson whelps to fill a single inventory slot with flame sacs.
---
So if you are on a super poor server where you have to vendor everything? no, I wouldn't say so.  But if you skin or can get value out of the flame sacs? sure.
---
Hate to say it but I've seen the same bug in retail \*shrug\* doesn't happen often but it happens
---
The thing is, classic is basically a perfect information game (minus a few things) since it has been out for 15 years.
---
Databases have so much information that you need to research it on your own.
---
Look at the map. Look at the zones within the map. Look at the mobs. Look at their drop tables. This should give you the information you need.
---
Easy reference would be: 
---
Beasts drop stackable grey items to vendor.
---
Humanoids drop cloth and silver.
---
Some tables are better, but this is where your research comes in :)
---
Good luck
---
what stops people from jumping layers in late game zones
---
Why would you work 20hours a day, I cannot imagine someone would want to be represented by a sleep deprived insane lawyer.
---
&gt;Flask of Titans is an overall DPS increase because you have the ability to ignore mechanics in favor of DPS with more health
---
I don't think it works too often. Only in Naxx, otherwise you shouldn't die even without Titans IMO, unless your healers suck.
---
For Supreme Power, good point, although we don't yet know if it works this way on Classic.
---
And again, please tell me how, "you get awarded a new mount every day just for logging in". This just simply isn't true. Classic wow circlejerk is insane.
---
Why are you assuming it was sent to all beta participants?
---
Really cool stuff! I hope to see more of these, these are just so cool!
---
What would be awesome if someone took your maps and started writing quests / stories into them...
---
About being wrong.
---
All the pservers are shutting down buddy. Blizzard's kicked up their legal team 1000% since the announcement of Classic.
---
The time investment to get to 60 made that content much more special and rewarding, IMO.  Paying for a boost and then less than 20 hours of streamlined leveling where you're never in danger makes people not invested in their characters at max and probably don't even know how to play them.  
---
A nice 10 days of play time is a getting training course on your character too.  The time investment is such that you wouldn't reroll lightly and every upgrade you get is a huge deal because you may have it for days and days of playtime.  The whole experience is more meaningful from an rpg standpoint.  Even if it felt like a chore it was a huge part of what made the game so good.
---
I'm getting flashbacks to air elementals being immune to my shamans lightning bolt.
---
Thnx
---
As far as i know did they wait for certain regions because of the ressources.
---
Nowaday they got the ressources and i hope they actually fill kalimdor and eastern kingdom.
---
Not just with end game content but fill it with everything.
---
Always asked myself if they couldnt add some kind of heritage for the races but i guess that would be impossible to implement. I dont talk about those dark iron dwarfs but rather arathi/alterac humans/dwarfs.
---
Even adding new capitals.. 
---
Dont know why but i always missed a mixture between those small villages and the big cities. 
---
I guess not enough space for that.
---
Uhhhh, it’s viable in naxx to survive stomp and stay on the aboms for more execute time in case it’s close etc etc.
---
Did you even read the whole thing?
---
I never said “that doesn’t answer my question, what class should I play?” The reason I stated that I was considering playing other classes is because he said he wasn’t going to let the small amount of gear get in the way of the class he wants to play... so if you go back to my post it say I’m thinking of playing a priest not IM GOING TO PLAY A PRIEST! 
---
He did answer my question and I agreed with him so please go fuck off and not put words in my mouth
---
Animal Croasings cycle is more gameplay influenced which is what inspires it in WoW. According to the guy who made the game and kept a journal from 2001 regarding the development.
---
There were some quest rewards that had limited charges that could really help with raids or dueling... but once used up they were gone for good.
---
I remember I still had some of them going into TBC as I was very stingy on using them.
---
Where did you get that idea?
---
you should play a different game
---
As a company that operates servers as the prime source of delivery for their product they could absolutely use different technologies to actively scale infrastructure and they are choosing not to. 
---
I've got no skin in the game on either side, but it's easy to see why someone would conclude that layering is an implementation that relates to poor architecture. Zoning/Layering can be absolutely amazing tech, but it's not the ONLY tech solution to the problem.
---
Is omegalul some cringey twitch chat thing?
---
I'm not disappointed by being wrong I learn the new knowledge and use it to be wrong less often in the future.  
---
Doubt I'm wrong though so maybe you'll learn something instead.
---
well the Goshek farm has alliance quests. i always played horde in vanilla, so i just assumed alliance had to kill stuff in the lumber mill. when i played alliance and there was nothing my disappointment was immeasurable and my day was ruined
---
Grenade breaks on damage but is on HoJ’s diminishing returns, not on Repentance’s.
---
We shall see how it looks in classic but i don't forsee it causing much issue to be honest. You just need some healers to be on point and know when to pop cooldowns and such to survive. We will see how it works but i will be running it ASAP.
---
I noticed this immediately, good attention to detail.
---
Cool stuff.  
---

---
just look at the druid, some of your information is just flat out wrong
---
A healer will never unequip robes of the exalted, not in molten core or bwl. The idea that you have expectations for a healer to get a choker of the firelord when the chain of reanimation is prettty much equal to it also is a big pepelaugh.
---
Both items drop from ud strat.
---
can you explain "the disaster"? also can you add some official links that confirms that was a disaster?
---
because, without proof, i think this is just bulshit. but with proof, i would be willing to learn something new
---
to op: this is very questionable humor :)
---
When was that though? Cause they changed it late tbc / early wotlk
---
don't you get a free 110 boost when you buy bfa?
---
probably that there won't be any layers, lol
---
The game releases in less than 2 months. How many no man's sky and anthem and fallout 76 type releases do people need to watch to realise a public beta is almost exactly how the game is gonna release. Some stuff will be fixed but if it's this broken this close to launch it won't change much.
---
nazis\* there's sadly a difference.
---
Your healer is not going to see that you have 4200 hp instead of your normal 3000. They are going to see that you are at half hp and then spend mana and globals to heal you.
---
Well there is, but not on azeroth...
---
Yeah well, mind your own Q's and P's then.
---
i thought layers were server wide not just zones, do you have a source
---
50% is insignificant?
---
everyone has the same access to rng, classes, and factions.  to bypass time schedule issues you actually have to plan your life around the game, that's bad design even if it is insignificant
---
Can top meters yes. If you're putting in the extra 30 min to gather buffs and 100g+ on the given raid night.
---
Supposing you want to do all these chores whilst being in a guild that does not. Big fish in a small pond. Appeals to some people.
---
MAKE. IT. HAPPEN.
---
i don't, i thought it was just zones. nvm then, fuck the system
---
also they make dopeass music
---
You can actually do this pre-60 as a holy paladin. It is a pain in the butt but it works as long as you wear plate.
---
I equipped a warden staff on my Warlock...
---
4 year old's bed time is 7:30. I'll be on every night 7:31 to probably way way too late. LOL
---
Oh really? Interesting. Just figured I should post it up here so it might grab a little attention
---
It’s about not getting one shot so you can stay in. It also helps on full nuke... ugh... the teleport dude in MC if you do the 50% melee all in tactic.
---
4th boss in bwl it means 1-2 more ticks before you gotta out.
---
List goes on and on, it has merit.
---
You can definitely be a fury OT, no problems. There are ALOT of different variations on specs though.

The important thing is the get the defiance talent in prot tree.

---
I don't really have a preference.  This seems like one of those details people think matters alot, but doesn't.  Sylvanas isn't even really a character in Classic WoW IIRC, so her model is actually, genuinely pretty irrelevant.
---
It's not until later WoW that they started making the story a clusterfuck of a few superhero WoW characters doing things and people started caring.  The same bad writing that makes the WoW universe feel small.
---
Yerrrrrrrr
---
The databases actually have a huge weakness that makes them very tough to use: they only accurately record data for mobs which drop cash. 
---
Any mob which does not drop cash (any beast, basically), it only records the drops of the mob WHEN THE MOB DROPS ANYTHING. 
---
There is a huge inaccuracy there, because not only does that mean that the drop tables for beasts are inflated, they are not necessarily uniformly inflated. You cannot compare the database entries for bears and cats, for example, or even bears and other bears, because it might be that bears drop items half the time and cats drop items 2/3 of the time. 
---
In addition, private servers are not accurate, so you can't test there. For example, chronos the third has a kinda comic bug where humans get a modest (probably inflated, but not by a huge amount) of 6 slot bags. Night elves, dwarves, and gnomes, on the other hand, just have silly drop rates for 6 slot bags. It's very hard to even get to level 6 as a night elf without finding at least 4 6 slot bags on random mob drops. 
---
In short, real testing is very much needed, especially for lower level mob grinds, where the data is very much present but not at all reliable unless you are comparing mobs which drop actual cash, and therefore get recorded every time anyone right clicks a corpse.
---
No.  You literally have no abilities.  You would just be standing there auto-atking, totem twisting.   The only way you can even remotely justify your slot is with Nightfall axe.  Even then, you are not likely to be a raid dps increase over another dps.
---
It's armor as weapons. WRATH.
---
Most lawyers are overworked.  We’re all people, too.  You may find that you don’t want to be represented by a lawyer who is underworked, considering that might tell you something about their demand.
---
...As for “insane,” I’m hoping I don’t qualify.
---
Oh, I know. It's still funny to think about though. I still would like a Dance Studio to change out our dances.
---
Literally the first hour or so of playing. Me and my friend made Nelf  Hunters together. We went exploring and I jumped off the cliff that is Teldrassil. I tried to get my ghost back to my body, which was perched on an outcropping halfway down the side, but no luck. So I went and talked to a spirit healer and read the spiel about Rez Sickness. Little ol' nooby me couldn't read apparently and thought it was a permanent 10% stat reduction. So I did the only logical thing and deleted that character. I made a human mage and have played that ever since.
---
I can guess what most people want and that is a better game which classic is. You think those examples will stop people from liking classic? All but the purples will be just as good in classic with a ton more content(while the phases unlock) and gameplay. People want good gameplay and that’s what is lacking with most games these days. Even if people say they like boring gameplay once they try it they will be hooked. I bet a huge majority that say retail is better haven’t even experienced vanilla style gameplay and just don’t understand.
---
If you're wondering how moddable wow is... [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2OzKWclncQ) is a custom wow project.
---
Real talk: as soon as you get Bestial Wrath you can solo new level 60 clothies. There is nothing that a new 60 warlock or mage can do against what is basically a level 40 elite that hits fast, cannot be CCd, and that runs faster than him.
---
You would get summoned to the location but not to their layre. You would only change layres in a resting zone or upon accepting a summon in a reting zone. I think its an and appropriate fix
---
You do know that the most recent beta build specifically changed layering so they can test it, right?
---
Divine shield rank 1 is learned at 34.

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c0ahuf/general_drakkisath_guide_from_2005/).
---
&gt;  I guess if they all handicap themselves on purpose..
---
You mean like half the raid? lol
---
And the "everything's destroyed"-aesthetic might have been fine for one expansion, but it really felt immersion breaking to have the main two continents be battered ruins for all eternity.
---
That's because they do.  Sometime in Wrath they started doing textures differently and things started looking funky.
---
Holy shit thats a name I havent heard in a while!
---
&gt;BGs were cross realm by end of Vanilla weren't they? I hope they turn it off personally but i believe it was there.
---
In an interview Omar said that BGs will be cross realm.
---
They said that it could stay until phase 2, so a few months at the least?
---
In 2019 with servers already in Sydney it would be patheticly slack and i wouldnt bother with wow ever again tbh
---
The delivery could use some work but the content and length were spot on.  Loved how it wasn't 15 minutes long.
---
Respecing will probably be cheaper than consumables anyway
---
This seems to be an unpopular opinion but for me, using resources like this would suck all the fun of exploration from the game.
---
Interesting, advocating for child labor.
---
Well I guess you will be happy with your new information so you can avoid times like these in the future. Cheers.
---
I dont really plan on hitting 60 anytime soon. Hell I realize I may never do it. I'm just looking to have some fun with my friends in wow.
---
There are things healers can’t heal through throughout raiding in Vanilla. I was stating that you could ignore things like standing in fire for a few more ticks to hit the boss a couple more times when you have Titans on.
---
I'm not sure why you bothered to type all that out when you could have just waited a few hours on someone else to ask. I mean it only gets asked 3-4 times per day.
---
I love when the pally bubbles go pop, pop, pop.
---
I still don’t get the idea, it’s a fun thought experiment and it looks good but what’s the purpose?
---
More leveling zones which you won’t see at 60? 
---
Long quest lines that give small trinkets and epic pieces upon completion that can compete with aq40 gear like sillithus boss summon rewards? 
---
It looks good don’t get me wrong but what do you want to happen there?
---
I'm insanely out of the loop, what is layering?
---
They can fish
---
But the same could be said about most of the places lol Look at all the scarlet stronghtholds in the midle of undead hordes. How can the scarlet scrusade inside stratholme survive ?
---
Yeah, we do know. Chili and Shadow Oil scales with spell power. They're both available in the beta at the current level cap.
---
afaik spec 2 becomes better than 1 at &gt;450 agi
---
It's a shame that it isn't really raid worthy. One of the biggest draws of a tbc server is it's the one place paladins exist as a sort of spell damage tank and are viable. 
---
I love me some vanilla for the pve/pvp gear overlap, class identity, interestesting items and consumables, but I just wish a lot of the specs had more viability.
---
Ok, so the idea would be to farm it, sit on it, wait for the market to establish itself, and then undercut the market in phase 2?
---
Never played wow is it a good game?
---
Ye a bunch of mmos use that system and call them channels, imo thats why itd be better if we could pick one and stay on it instead of being able to jump around lile that
---
Need a Kitty to help you? Would like to fuck around there. For the Horde!
---
I'm married, work full time and have a two year old, so I've been asking myself the same question. Since my daughter was born I've severely cut down on my gaming time and realized that it's only partly due to me getting older and having more responsibilities. The other part is just that there are less games out there that I want to play. WoW Classic and other older MMO's are really the type of game I enjoy the most, and games like that are few and far between. 
---
When Classic drops I'm going to continue my usual routine of playing for a few hours after my daughter falls asleep. On nights when we have plans, I won't be playing those days. The hard part for me will be to find a guild or group that will mix with my schedule and also avoiding the temptation of playing too many characters. I want to have the feeling of accomplishment and I invariably always spread myself too thin.
---
That’s not really true either. You can by all of the items you need to make the hammer outside of your guild’s activity. Many guilds don’t even provide those items for the members who want the hammer and expect them either to pay the guild bank or buy from other guilds.
---
Damn, addon when
---
They want layering specifically for the queues and the actual player experience. They said they have the technology to handle mega high populations, but they don't want that.
---
I've never liked him, but couldn't really put a reason to it. Why do you say he's a scam artist out of curiosity?
---
I got my wife into WoW. We play together. That helps a lot. Also look into casual guilds. My guild is all over 30 and most of us are married with kids. We only plan on 1 maybe 2 raid days a week. There will be guilds out there for you bro. Classic is about the journey not just the end game progression raiding. Imo
---
You're comparing No Man's Sky to WoW? Come on, man.
---
&gt; I retract my statement - it would be more accurate to say that layering could potentially be active for the entirety of phase one, but no longer than that. Knowing Blizzard I'd expect them to use it for as long as they are able to though (i.e. the entirety of phase one).
---
Dude your work is amazing.
---
That just seems like a classical mmorpg thing tho.
---
Could you do the areas left from ud starting loc (deathknell) and Gilneas? There's also lots of unused land north from western plaguelands.
---
Yup have plummeted to my death a few times lol
---
Bruh but Tauren.
---
Blizzard never said their servers cant handle the load. You do realize having 9k people split up into 3 layers on the same server is the same load as 9k people on 1 layer, right? This has nothing to do with server load.
---
already on it my dude
---
I don't want any changes and I still use a ton of addons.  Anything allowed in the Blizzard API is fair game.
---
Yeah there are groups planning to clear MC before most people will even hit level 30. That means playing 18 hours a day for the first two weeks.
---
It's a test, for testing purposes. The game launches in August. Want to enjoy WoW on your terms? Go play BoA.
---
lol no
---
No i did not im afraid
---
Im not saying imagine taking retail DH and Dks and put them in classic just cap them at 60 or after naxx content
---
I mean imagine if Blizzard did what they intended to to do. Playable  deathknights and DH in vanilla
---
Starting out at level one, a lot of their mechanics that would make them stupid op, would stripped down to be more fitting for vanilla.
---
But to poke at the idea of after naxx content. Obv  BC and Wrath Servers will come (personally dont want wrath because thats when it all started getting bad)
---
But after? Idk. I have some weird hopes that they recode and redevelop cata and so on. So it stayed more vanilla and never snowballed into what it is now.
---
Overworked by whom, I don't know what you mean by lawyer I guess, are not they accepting clients based on time they can work for them and charging by the hours, do they charge the same for the 20th worked hour of a day and the 1st.
---
I asked Kevin Jordan about this on his Twitch stream and he basically couldn't remember the specifics of why hunters had lower crit scaling, but was quite sure it was for pvp reasons, as Blizzard felt hunters were very strong back in Vanilla pvp.
---
It doesn’t mean you can ignore them entirely, but you can definitely take a couple more ticks of fire damage or w/e else in exchange for more dps on the boss.
---
I'll run 1-2 weekend raids with people who care more about relaxing drunken fun instead of 5 nights a week progression.
---
soda has been pretty cool about ganking before.... i actually dont believe he meant it, but it instantly became a meme so it will be remembered now regardless.
---
But i say again, i cant wait to corpsegank asmongold.   
---
Ohh and that guy that started crying when he didnt get the mount! i dont remember his name, plays with asmon.
---
What game/program is released without any bugs?
---
It's a beta dude, this is exactly what beta is for.
---
Just as whiny as in 2004. Very vanilla.
---
The same 14 year olds that are obsessed with fortnite? Nothing against other games, but I doubt the younger generation going to join in this one as much as the old players coming back for nostalgia.
---
You let people do the same thing that happens at a grocery store.
---
"Hey this lane has 10 people but that one over there has 2 people"
---
Some people might go to the line that's gunna get them in and out the fastest, and others might say these 10 people look fun I'm gunna go through all this with them and start up a conversation while they waited.
---
I have no first hand experience of a private server, but you seem to think classic wow is so hard.
---
I was there. It wasn't.
---
The entire reason for WoW2 would be that it could be done in a new engine or heavily modified engine, so it could be very very different from a modern expansion pack.  
---
The problem is Blizzard has always been about the safe bet and easy money, they absolute loath taking risks or pushing the envelope - look at Starcraft 2 and Diablo 3 and Overwatch. They won't change the WoW:18month xpack formula until it's not profitable so expect it to be around for another decade at least.
---
4 hours a day is a HUGE time investment.
---
DOn't even try to sugarcoat it.
---
casual = 6-10 hours/week, like any hobby.
---
You're playing 28+ hours/week.  that's a second nearly fulltime job.
---
Diremaul shard runs.  I wanted Furor's compendium.
---
 in a country with proper laws (European countries) that's not a problem. Lh-ope isnt shutting down because of blizz's lawyers, its because classic seems like its going to honor what vanilla was. Dont you worry about that lmao
---
Username checks out?
---
Call me when they do it on both factions. "All" my ass. Them and their knockoff wannabe-Oogas are just gonna drive all the streamers to Horde.
---
Is this viable as early as MC? I'm really drawn to this because it will let me be useful to raid, tank 5 man's, and still farm and pvp at a reasonable level!
---
Thanks for the tips
---
I guess it can be considered an alt timeline
---
Im just saying what if Blizzard had the power and resources back in 04 that they could do what they orginally planned
---
And that was to have at least dk and Dh in vanilla (obv the classes wouldnt be what they are in retail)
---
I can completely relate.  Was a home-schooled nerd when WoW came out.  I would get all my schoolwork done by noon, and then play WoW for 14 hours every day.  Did that for years.  I loved the competitive scene of raiding.  At points, I was the top hunter on my server.  But, I don't think that'll happen this time around.  Now, I'm a software engineer with a girlfriend whom I not only need to show attention, but I also want to show her attention.  I have given her a little bit of warning that the first weekend that classic has released, I'll be somewhat of a hermit.  But, that weekend is probably one of the few moments I'll have to play like that.  I imagine this time around, I'll be focusing more on PvP instead of raiding.  If I can't raid how I want to (dumping hours upon hours into it), then I don't really want to raid at all.  PvP is going to be much more manageable for someone like me.
---
Of course. I did it back then and I'll do it again. It's the definition of a grind well rewarded. 15 years later and I still enjoy the reward.
---
One day you'll learn what insinuating means, but until then, good luck. I already said they've said everything from a few months to a few weeks, but you're working off of the worst case scenario and acting like "a few months" is the only scenario which even exists. Doomsayer.
---
Holy crap. I figured it was just a place for Alliance to quest. Didn't realize it was actually useless.
---
It's a damn shame because that could make for a fantastic quest hub.
---
Likewise, the Goshek farm could have incorporated a PVP quest or something. Oh well.
---
I wonder if that's the female dwarf hunter from Stormrage I helped.  (Borri)
---
Sure, I played one of them that wasn't SM/Ruin (it was mostly Affliction), and it seemed fine.
---
&gt; endgame
---
I'm not talking about strictly endgame and never was. If you are saying there is only one specific cookie cutter spec for a given raid ignoring PvP, then you may be correct. But there's a whole lot of game outside of that, and for that, talent trees are pretty nice.
---
It’s a hyperbole to get his point across. And since you seem dense, his point is most mounts are handed to the player for little to no work.
---
'Anal backstab' in the chat had me giggle.
---
Right. That’s why I said minus a few things. As a general overview, the databases are a great tool. I use them and test on private servers. Percentages can vary but I’m ok with that. Chances are you aren’t going to be in the perfect grinding spot 100% of the time, but you make due.
---
If you start as Tauren you have to run from level 11/12 from the Thunderbluff camp to camp T, and run up to crossroads. It takes a good 15 minutes it feels like. All the while there are red level 18 mobs around you.
---
mare nostrum Azeroth 
---
sure
---
There is the sack of marbles you get from the fargodeep mine quest that makes your enemy’s chance to hit reduced by 25 percent or something. They worked on lvl 60 and higher mobs.
---
Not sure I understand what you’re saying.  An hour billed is an hour billed, whether it’s at 2pm or 4am.  Most lawyers aren’t solo practitioners.  You don’t typically have a say over just how much your workload is going to be.  In most cases you either work for a firm or a company, and in either place your workload will be dictated by what’s needed and how soon.
---
Survival will never beat 17/31/3, the 5% damage is way too strong until late Naxx.
---
My biology teacher 
---
Was also my football teams offensive coorindator
---
= oxymoron example.
---
The biggest grievance for me was the fragmentation of playerbase. Pvp was instanced into arenas, social relations started to break down with dungeon finder and elite raiders started to do their own thing instead of distributing these hard to find drops through the 5-man dungeons. People never had meaningful relations and they had no reason to do so. The MMO part of wow became instanced solo play.
---
That's really the answer I'm looking to confirm. 
---
I raided in Vanilla, but as a Hunter, and that far back I wasn't a great player nor really paid attention to other classes, so I don't have any first hand knowledge of vanilla enhancement.
---
&gt;And that fine they can have their own servers with lots of layering and LFG and stuff but why cant I have a server without it all?
---
?? Why are you acting like it's 15k pop or layering and there's no in between?
---
&gt;I just simply do not see a problem with having other players in my MMO, I dont see that as an issue and never have. 
---
Neither does anyone else, but again, 15k pop is not Blizzlike at all and is not enjoyable for the vast majority of people. That doesn't mean people don't enjoy having other people in their MMO.. wtf?
---
&gt;3K pop is certinaly a living world but who says Blizzard will live up to their word? Live can bearly handle 40 people in a single zone so why would I believe they will have 3K people in each layer? 
---
Clearly you haven't watched their interviews. Retail is massively resource heavy compared to vanilla when it comes to spells etc, which is why retail has a hard time with a lot of people at once, while vanilla is the opposite and can thus easily manage a lot of people at once. And again, if you're going to work off of the assumption that Blizzard will do the exact opposite of what they're promising, there is no point discussing anything.
---
Most of guilds let shaman roll on the hand of rag, because it's not a pve weapon.
---
I didn't play in Vanilla, what class/spec would normally get the drop? There doesn't seem to be a lot of Ret Pallys or Enh Shamans in Vanilla raids, and Warriors use 1h for the most part right? Just curious who it usually goes to?
---
I've never really felt bad for Lemmings.
---
I dunno, I keep watching Monkeynews pwnin’ frost mages on his stream.
---
Stayed home from work one afternoon to meet the cable guy for my setup in my new apartment.  I had a WoW background on my monitor and the young man caught a glance of that and started asking what I played, server, etc.  Turns out he was the shy pally tank in my guild that I didn’t know very well before that.  Unfortunately over the years I lost touch, but super curious about how he’s doing today.  Looking forward to making new friends and memories in Classic!
---
Changed my working times to 36 hours a week. Kicked the grillfriend out. So that's 36 hours a week of work. Would like to sleep 8 hours a day = 56. Preparing food and working out about 3 hours a day times 6 is 18 hours a week. So 168 hours a week minus 36 minus 56 minus 18 = 58 hours a week left for Classic sums up to be 8.28 hours a day.
---
It would have been cool to take a boat without a loading screen. Just make the island close to the main land and have the boat just take like 30 secs to make it there. Would be really cool to have an actual boat ride.
---
you'll still be able to enjoy the game, just not in the exact same way that you specifically want to enjoy it in. just like people who want dungeon finder won't be able to enjoy it the game in the exact way they want, or people who want flying mounts, or people who want to play a human hunter, or people who want artifacts. Just because you don't like a certain aspect at a certain time point of a game's lifespan does not mean that the aspect should be changed. 
---
&gt;It's absolutely silly to be okay with this experience and worse yet to welcome it.
---
You statement is absolutely silly: you admit that there are people who don't want layering despite the increased competition for mobs in starting zones, which means that they think they will enjoy the game more without layering than with layering. By admitting the existence of such people, you are either contradicting your very own statement by saying that layering is better for them, or you are saying that you know better than they do about what they really want. Either way, it's very silly.
---
From my understanding, someone else will post clips of his streams with a click-baity title.
---
Thank you for the feed back! 
---
When I stream I feel like I talk to people fine and interact without issue; however, the moment I click that record button instead of go live I feel awkward and I can definitely hear it while I'm editing the video. Took me a while to get comfortable while streaming, I'm guessing it will be the same for youtube.
---
Thanks again for your feed back and I'll definitely be working on the delivery =).
---
Comparatively this is even worse than the others, they'd have to fight through much more undead to reach safety than going out Stratholme to Tyr's Hand, plus we know how they actually survived, it was because balnazzar was controlling them.
---
It just looks way too odd in that place with no ports, it looks like a perfect place to have a port with a city of that size.
---
Thank you. I agree completely. 
---
Those are always the best memories. Looking back, it would be such a fond, incredible thing to remember.
---
Someone please gold this one hahaha
---
No.. fucking.. way im doing that shit again. When i start seeing them on vanilla tho, I’m gonna be so jealous. Always been my favourite
---
0/21/30 is never better than 20/31/0 *unless* you're getting trueshot provided by another hunter to you, and that is realistically not going to happen.
---
It's debatable which one is better between 20/31/0, 17/31/3 and 13/31/7, but that's mostly situational.
---
For some it's not a race. I'm trying to enjoy the ride, rather than race towards 60.
---
If you're hard, you grind back up your rep for the goblin factions in another area so you don't lose bloodsail rep, and keep the Bloodsail pirates at revered while you grind the goblins back to exalted.
---
Not really no.
---
This changes everything
---
&gt;Thus the response "Do you have a link [to that clip of the female streamer rage quitting *because she was corpse camped*]?"
---
Fixed.  
---
The discussion went like this:  
---
A:They Corpse camp: a streamer rage quit because she was corpse camped by them. 
---
B: Can you prove she was corpse camped?
---
A: {Link}
---
You’re claiming the discussion went something like:
---
A: They Corpse camp: a streamer rage quit because she was corpse camped by them. 
---
B: Can you prove the streamer rage quit?
---
Your version doesn’t make sense because no one was questioning whether or not she quit.  They were questioning whether or not the gang corpse camps.
---
You're still not solving or being preventative of any problem simply by saying Blizzard won't do as they're saying. That is just a statement of speculation, nothing else. The point of layering is to make the STARTING experience smoother. No one sees other players in their MMO as a problem, jesus, it's about being able to actually play the game. The world will be full of people, since the cap will be around 3k just like in vanilla. Clearly you didn't play vanilla if you think pserver cap is the only way.
---
What would farming gold look like for me as a 30/0/21 shaman heals?
---
Then do not "sit around struggling to tag mobs". Instead, do something else. Engage your critical thinking. Learn to be social. Discover new things.
---
I don't want my favorable human experience harmed, simply because you're incapable of engaging your inner humanity.
---
There is a trinket that gives 25 all stats on struck. Pretty gg for a low lvl quest reward.
---
You're missing the point. The point is that 15k pop launches are miserable, whether the server is free or not doesn't change that.
---
Do whatm
---
and not have to pay for the privilege.
---
Go find the clip of Quinn on Twitch yelling about the  stun resists. That alone is enough to role orc.
---
120 hours? Yeah fucking right. Try 300 plus
---
What I am saying is that someone cannot work well without sleep, you would not want a truck driver falling asleep on the road as you would not want a lawyer making mistake because he has been working 20hours straight and cannot think correctly but also because he would charge you as if it was a premium hour which sounds like a scam.
---
Really? wow. Any trees at all? or are there types?
---
&gt;In a sharded world, for instance, there might be 5-6 sharded areas, one for each step of the quest chain.
---
That's phasing, not sharding.
---
Its because company's see games as software as a service and not as a finished product.
---
If you would just stop staring at your collection of kiddie porn for a second and go back and actually try your hardest to read, maybe, just maybe, you would realize that I never said such a thing.
---
I'm not getting my hopes up though.
---
&gt;  Is it likely you'll get banned? Probably not.
---
and that is why most people buy gold.
---
I don't remember the specific's but I think I recall 480+ or even 500+ of course the more agility the better it scaled and did.
---
I wonder if logging for rest exp daily would negate the extra time it would take to travel to your questing location rather than doing one 6hr block of play time every day
---
My personal experience is that most private servers had rarer drop rates to encourage auction house spending and gold buying, and were supported by the gold farmer industry.
---
Could you explain whats going on to a wow noob?

---
The problem is by cataclysm, the vision of WoW from Vanilla and early BC had been compromised. 
---
People who wanted to put in no time and get results had already experienced year# of getting their way.
---
I’m not saying all casualifacations to the mmo formula is bad. I think the ideal sits somewhere between Everquest, WoW Vanilla/BC, and Wrath—but at a certain point, once you’ve turned your back enough from what you were, it makes sense to keep trudging forward. 
---
For example, leveling on live is a such a hollow pointless experience, that the default new character should be 110, and the paid $60 character should be 120. 1-110 is a useless, superfluous time sink. They’ve eroded what it means to level to the point that its continued existence as necessary content is just bad design.
---
Thank you!
---
&gt; Zoning/Layering can be absolutely amazing tech, but it's not the ONLY tech solution to the problem.
---
Well I never said it was.  But to say that the introduction of zoning/layering is "server architecture regression" is just ignorant.
---
to be fair across all 5 maps I've made there's 4 new dungeons and 2 new raids.
---
Also I'm not really sure what you mean, what the point of playing any of the game, if you don't like quests and trinkets whats the point of doing anything in the game?
---
ok, new technology just used to exploit an already exploited old build of that game, so?
---
There’s always gonna be the elite horde pvp squad that is better than your alliance pvp squads, and horde does have the potential to parse higher in fights. But generally speaking ally is superior to horde in vanilla hands down.
---
&gt;Sorry but you sound like you’re not a very good healer. :(
---
Awww. Is making a counter point difficult for you? ;(
---
Hey was this done using Svelte?
---
The question wasn't about classic at all
---
I remember when those were tradable :D
---
That's not how you spell /r/outside
---
It shouldn't be needed that far into the leveling process. Many toons never get the high in the first place.
---
If it is a problem at higher level then Blizz messed up. Either way, the tech is already creating inauthentic situations/game play and needs to be looked at.
---
Dunno what vanilla world you played in but my guild didn’t use any consumables, had a bunch of potatoes, and still cleared content without many problems.
---
Always strikes me an a kind of insane position since nothing about this is how Vanilla was. We started in 1.0, not 1.12. If they aren't going to do that, then they shouldn't do 1.12 either...improve on the class balance and specs.
---
This mount is helping me pick a gnome warrior over a nightelf! I want the better pvp racial but I like frontflips better.... But I think this mount looks so much better when you're non night elf.  Looks more unique imo when you're a non night elf on this bad boy.
---
I think you’re under the impression that a lawyer a) has nothing to lose from messing something up at the 20th hour of work, and b) will face no consequences for messing something up.  Both are false.  Plenty of lawyers are basically poor, and plenty others are disbarred for careless mistakes.  You can rest assured that while being a lawyer in a trade like anything else is, just because someone is overworked doesn’t make it a “scam.”  OBGYNs regularly work 24 hour shifts.  No one calls that a scam, but you sure don’t want them messing up a delivery.  Sleep deprivation is a fact of life as a professional.  There are sketchy lawyers just like there are sketchy doctors, but the mere fact that people work long hours doesn’t mean they’re ripping you off.
---
I rememeber doing it all throughout vanilla -- and as a side note not being able to in private servers.
---
It does help when you take the zepplin to Org/GGol/UC a lot.
---
Fuck. This fucks me
---
With the gear I had cherry picked, I beat Marks spec hunters easily and also was hands down better at CC and kiting.

So whatever...

Yessssss
---
It actually releases in closer to two months. Not saying anything like they are crunched for time, just pointing that out.
---
Small bug I noticed... if you click on a zone such as Elywnn Forest, then click on a neighboring zone such as Westfall, your navigation path or whatever above the map/satellite view it's called looks like this:  
---
Azeroth  
---
Eastern Kingdoms  
---
Elwynn Forest  
---
Westfall
---
Instead of:
---
Spot on.
---
The world of gaming has moved WAY far away from slow paced, grindy, MMOs..
---
I just don't see kids these days having the patience for classic wow.
---
Yes it will work really well for offtanking purposes. Infact, later into the game with proper gearing even the Maintanks will be using this spec, or variations of it.
---
&gt;Are you going to do it.
---
Horde doesn't have time to deal with such pesentry saber mount grinds.
---
*Laughs in Orcish with Skeletal warhorse*
---
It goes to whoever can afford it. Hardly any guilds will front all of the costs of crafting the hammer. They may give you some items for free/at a discount but it’s on that player to create it. 
---
Once you have figured out who can afford it, then you consider who will use it. On Alliance side it will almost always go to a paladin who PvPs a lot and is an active member of the guild. Warriors may want it, but it usually goes to a paladin.
---
On Horde side it’s kind of a toss up between warriors and shaman but I see it going to shaman more often than not. A lot of the time the bigger ticket items like this go to the guild master or one of the GMs friends.
---
You are just seeing a lot of testing. Layers would never be in effect on the beta if they weren't just testing them, not enough population. Day 1 will have both the most and smallest layers, quickly increasing in size as the population disperses and simultaneously reducing in number as fewer players log on. You'll barely even notice layering by week 2.
---
Clusters create a lot of problems because they lack the flexibility and opaqueness of layering. Are you creating all the clusters up front? Then you have to guess how many and how big to make them as that can't be adjusted. Or are you adding clusters later as OG clusters fill up? Then I can wait to join a new cluster if I missed the originals so that I can be ahead of the pack. What if I want to make a bank alt on a full cluster? Do the clusters share AH and mail, etc.? There are many more issues than just this. What if my guild is in the middle of joining one cluster but only half get to create characters before it locks?
---
Layering is a better solution hands down if implemented both sparingly and responsibly.
---
Sorry but I disagree and saw different results back during Vanilla when I raided and there was two others hunters and we ran our gear at the time through a spreadsheet.
---
If this zone came about, I’d want it to be like the Na Pali coast of Hawaii. Tall sea cliffs with a jungle above.
---
You can add any number, you can't mathematically beat 5% to all damage and a 20% dps increase on pet.
---
In addition people forget that the benefit from any % crit lower each time you add one more. So if you are stacked with world buff, survival is shit compared to 20/31/0.
---
Is there a group where you agree on what to spam each day?
---
Good god you're dense
---
thet's defo how the western part would be
---
&gt; Server 1, 2, 3, and 4 share the same player/guild names pool and an eventual plan to merge, precluding the need to worry about name changes.
---
So... literally phasing, but worse.
---
Nah sharding is going to ruin classic this idea will not work.  Just dont open 100 servers my dude.
---
&gt;grounded
---
I agree. No flying mounts.
---
What's the bug?
---
They are slowly making people accept sharding. First it was just the starting zones. Then it was just for the first week. Then it's just until the first world bosses. Then it becomes more and more aggressive. People should have been against any form of layering from the start.
---
We are aware of it and thanks for pointing it out. It'll get fixed soon so that it is more logical.
---
But then everyone else does the apothecary quest to run to TB and you already have the flight paths. :P
---
Im sure its the same with pallies
---
Get t2 and get rags weap
---
Youll be allowed to dps.
---
You could just enter the instance. I'm sure it isn't going to be layered within the instance!
---
Now for quests it would suck to be already at the quest mob, inv someone from chat, have them also be right at the quest mob, but not be able to do the quest together.
---
I get the sentiment of making a "visual" BiS site and thats cool and all, and don't take offence to this but literally ANYONE is better off using one of the MANY BiS excel sheets that are freely available on the internet.
---
Any plans for Uldum, Hyjal, Gulneas or Ahn'Qiraj? (idk what you can do here)
---
Oh damn, I forgot it's no longer 30 :D
---
It does increase the gap between semi-hardcore and fully-hardcore melees. Basically the latter need most of the caster consumables too. Somehow similar to weaving hunters needing melee ones.
---
i'm very happy for you that you found WoW the perfect game and never once has there been anything about it you would change, for had there been you would have quit and not be here today to make me realize that I must continue the journey to find my own flawless experience, goodbye friend
---
How is it draining the resources lmao? It needs to be tested.
---
And then when the maelstrom wasn’t epic enough for people they put in “Epicus Maximus &lt;Paragon of Epicosity&gt;, a level 90 elite shark, who is being ridden by an elite rare devilsaur named &lt;And a Dinosaur&gt; riding a rocket and manning (dinosauring?) a laser beam, being ridden by an undead mage playing guitar named &lt;Rock On&gt;”
---
Interesting. I'll be playing Resto Shaman but I wouldn't want it even if it dropped. Never been good at making money in WoW so I probably won't be able to afford respecs to enhance much less the mats for it. Kind of sucks that a Legendary like that doesn't help with Raid progress at all though.
---
Then why does Alliance dominate the pvp scene on every private server and all the top guilds and players are Alliance?
---
Fair enough! Thanks for the info.
---
Yes to all those zones
---
as well as eversong, ghostlands, azuremyst, bloodmyst
---
and 4 more new zones
---
Pretty sure those don't exist in 1.12.
---
What about pre raid pvp that emphasizes stamina?
---
Yeah quests r hard guyz, I have to read???? Wut? Lol
---
Blizzard reasoning was basically that because guilds used hybrids as healers in raid, they assumed people liked to play Healer and they never really cared enough to add the apropriate gear for the other specs or fix the mechanical issues.
---
That's why every hybrid have amazing healer itemization a mechanics, but their DPS and Tank specs are riddled with issues that never got addressed before TBC.
---
Ironically enough Paladin offspecs were better before the class revamp. F.ex you had Blessing of Kings as the 31 point talent in Retribution instead of Repentence. It didnt really change how much DPS the class did, but it did guarantee at least one Ret Paladin would be in every raid for the Blessing.
---
After the 1.9 revamp the talent got moved to Protection, and Holy Paladins could get every single improved blessing or utility spell you wanted in a raid.
---
Nice, you're getting them out really fast in these dark days of no Beta Access
---
No, it's a trying to form an opinion from a Twitch clip with a guy screaming I have autism over the original audio. Had dug up the original yesterday and it did seem pretty clear.
---
   I have the Venomhide Ravasaur. And it feels underwhelmed next yo all the Blizz Store mounts and Brutosaurs.
---
   But I guess in Classic that wont be a problem.
---
It's cheaper.
---
&gt; Layering is obviously broken somehow.
---
If only there were some sort of test realm available... where people could test these things out, and report when they don't work as expected. Hmmm... :P
---
I don't have enough melee experience, but which bosses (before Naxx) have "fire"? Only Magmadar comes from the top of my head. And Ony of course. But I'd expect one to be able to reposition himself without losing DPS..?
---
We all know that the server cap will be lower than 5k. Layering is just a mistake and we all know that too.
---
As a Night Elf Druidess, yes. Yes I am going to do it.
---
I ran with 2 other hunters during our raids and got a chance to test the specs and saw different.
---
21marks/30surv is an endgame spec that takes cherry picked gear and does scale better and out performs Marks hunters who think wearing T2/T3 gear is the be all end all of gearing.
---
I used
---
Want your opinion on this:
---
I'm rolling Shaman and I plan to duo level with a Prot Warrior, the idea is to go Enh/Resto hybrid to smack shit with windfury while questing and do some good healing in dungeons, but switching to full Resto at 60 to raid. 
---
My doubt is about how good is my strategy. I don't care for the optimal way to play, I'm not in a hurry to get to 60, just wanna experience the world at my own pace, but I also don't want to be useless. 
---
Can I reliably get some healing gear along the way to swap in dungeons? 
---
Is Mana Tide Totem important during leveling? I know it's essential in raids, but since I'm going 0/25/26, I was left wandering how much I'm missing by not taking it till 60.
---
Cheers!
---
What's the name of it?
---
bingo, the population of the game will be older and more mature. 
---
The kids that join will be those that watch the streamers, and most wont last more than a month. Kids play games that their friends play, which is console / mobile titles for the most part.
---
only lasts like 6 seconds until later ranks
---
I understand the economies of buying gold.  Comparing it on a just gold/hr, gold/$, and $/hr scale it's 'worth' buying gold for just about anybody with a job.  If you just do this math it's not factoring in the chance you'll get banned and what that will cost you.
---
Go ahead and risk your account doing this if you want, but don't say you weren't warned.  Their algorithms for banning people buying gold, power leveling, and other $$$ services are better than ever.  And when they detect a gold selling racket they wait and watch the gold for months on end before they ban all the accounts that purchased gold and the sellers in one ban wave to catch as many cheaters as possible.
---
You could also lose access to all your blizzard games depending on how sever the penalty.
---
Need some Wildhammer in Northeron
---
Yeah, i used this lie too in retail Vanilla to PVE in pvp gear. But no, MM/beast is far superior to survival.
---
You suffer a cognitive bias toward critics, but fact is 1% damage increase is way better than 1% crit past the 25% crit mark.
---
And the ap benefit will never compensate for the bonus on multishot and the 25% damage from pet, in addition you can get IAOTH procs and benefit more from trinket like swarmguard and Jom Gabbar.
---
I mean I have a 9-5, 35 hour a week job so I'll still have enough hours to play. Not as much as 10 years ago, but enough that I'll be satisfied. You're probably in the minority with how much you work.
---
Don't you dare say that time will be wasted. It will be beautifully spent.
---
we do?
---
hell, if I was 16 again I would probably be doing something similar. But I am not and that's okay, 16 year old me was a dumbass anyway.
---
Maybe you should read your own post. You made it sound like quest helper add-ons weren't in Vanilla. I don't use them, but it's not a conflict with the /#nochanges people
---
I'm not \*that\* evil.
---
Tanaris was always worse for me.
---
Great! Now defeat the plague.

For everything there is in WoW, +5% for a  fishing loot table is absolutely insignificant.   You gave it a 50% value as an estimate... and opinion.

Is "The Rear Port" a euphemism for a robot's asshole?

If they aren't competition on one layer then they aren't competition on any layer. So why are you complaining.
---
More layers = more supply = lower prices

If the other player is in another layer. And unless they hop to yours.

Interesting. I could have sworn I had seen people do it sooner than 50. Guess I remembered wrong.

Well said!
---
It shouldn't be a huge difference.  XP is XP regardless if you're a tank, DPS, or healer.

new servers made old servers ghost realms. Blizzard would suggest new servers if you started to play after 1.10 and it really hurt new people joining the old severs.

They can use cheap instances with low capacity that are used on demand rather than paying much more for permanent big ones with a lot of unused capacity. Modern wow servers start dying whenever there's more than a couple dozen people doing world pvp, why do you think that is? Costs.

I do not even know why I spend time responding to a comment like that. The very specific and expensive TN panel I was talking about scores higher than most IPS displays on the Adobe RGB scale.

Google Asus PG27Q. It's 4ms responstime, IPS, 165Hz, 1440p.

"Most " In reality that lag / delay is caused by a combination of two things - the signal processing delay caused by the TFT electronics / scaler, and the response time of the pixels themselves. Most "input lag" measurements over the years have always been based on the overall display lag (signal processing + response time) and indeed the SMTT tool is based on this visual difference between a CRT and TFT and so measures the overall display lag. In practice the signal processing is the element which gives the *feel* of lag to the user, and the response time of course can impact blurring, and overall image quality in moving scenes. As people become more aware of lag as a possible issue, we are of course keen to try and understand the split between the two as much as possible to give a complete picture.

Honestly, its a problem they keep adding to by making more levels. one of the biggest mistakes that stacked onto itself was adding levels in BC.

Sleep deprivation is not the rule of professional life, medical personal have rotating hours. Overworking yourself ends up costing society more. Sleeping less than a certain number of hours has a detrimental effect on your health, abusing your own health for the benefit of your firm is silly. Maybe that is how lawyers work but then they are silly and it would be a strange economic if you had to work for 20hours a day and be poor, someone somewhere benefited on that.
---
Sometimes people take naps or short breaks, or drink coffee. I've heard stories of cocaine use as well.
---
But it's the norm for young attorneys to be overworked for years. I don't think 20 hours is the norm every day - that's the once in a while crazy day. But they do work more than normal people on a regular basis and are often expected to get in a certain amount of hours per month/year.
---
The one exception here would be if they decided to release Karazhan as Classic content instead of it being in TBC. They've said that's a possibility.
---
Yeah haha pretty much, but then again that applies to people speedleveling as well. Rush to 60 then complain when they run out of content...
---
More than likely not undercutting. The demand will be to high. Once the populations are merged together there will be an abundance of people clamoring for the flask material that is now much more difficult to farm. The demand will be there and the supply can control it. Imagine it more akin to oil prices and the ability for select players to control the economy at there whims because they have a stockpile.

Doesn't that teleport you to the graveyard you initially spawned at?

Why Azuremyst and Bloodmyst? Were they even in the original concept maps for Azeroth? I kinda thought they were conjured up because it didn't make sense to force the Draenei starting area into the actual continent of Kalimdor. The Blood Elves fit nicely around Silvermoon, naturally. And Draenei needed to go to Kalimdor because 3/2 faction start balance.

How hard is tanking really? Is it worth playing a warrior if i won't be able to play hardcore like i used to?

There are simply too many alternatives for that particular class and spec to be viable. Now, I’m not saying you shouldn’t do it, I think  you should since 40 people is tough to get and some dps is better than 0 dps.
---
With luck on a VERY short fight (25 sec Zerg) you still lag behind by 50%

Yes the somewhat frustrating experience for a day or two is totally a valid reason to change how the game works on a fundamental level.

Basically this. I'm all for people playing what they want, and such. But I'm asking from a purely competitive perspective.

I intend to be competitive, and would only consider enhancement if under ideal circumstances it was remotely possible. From the sounds of it, it is not.

Or it could just be that WoW isn't for everyone, and they should leave it that way. This game is also about leveling, crafting, interaction with others and traveling around different regions. WoW is the continuation from the warcraft series, a 'story'game I loved so much as a kid (and still do). If you just like fast pvp matches, or co-op mazes, or whatever, there are many other games which provide that kind of stuff. If they want to provide just that piece of WoW for an extra fee, they should make another game entirely, not putting the distinct part of WoW at risk for just a quick cash-in. But that's my opinion.
---
Ps: sorry for any spelling mistakes hehe.
---
I do. Believe they drop green+ weapons and armors as well. Certain levels are farmed for BoEs due to how weak they are.
---
You seem to think you know the facts here?
---
Sorry but me and others saw vastly different results and topped the damage meters using the 21marks/30surv spec and it was not even hard... the only time Marks even came close was if they got to AoE
---
Many oldschool forums/guides and private servers understand and know this... it always makes me laugh when I see a diehard Marks hunter cry and get butthurt because they got spanked on the damage meter while wearing their T2/T3 gear
---
I did it during wrath. I’m definitely doing it again, just not sure when. Wanted to do it right off rip but not sure yet
---
Onions have layers
---
Lok-tar Ogar!
---
if this shit goes love i din play simple
---
Well said.
---
Sweet! Only 6 more years!
---
Wait...what subreddit am I in...
---
I followed him around for a bit and /waved.  
---
I was on an Orc Warrior with a name he would have recognised but I don't know if he ignored it or didn't notice, I would have thought it was hard to miss though.
---
If blizzard were smart they would be drawing up plans to add content patches under the classic system after vanilla content runs its course.
---
I guess that is technically #nochanges. I'm just a bigger fan of bgs before Battle Groups.
---
I'm just commenting on the final sentence of the highlighted paragraph. I just don't get player housing.
---
Holy fuck. Did people actually do this? Jesus Christ.
---
Yeah, pretty sure it does, I tried something similar to get to Ironforge, BEFORE I knew that the Tram existed. wasted a good amount of time, but learned alot.
---
Is that a huge piece of broccoli in the beginning?
---
To be fair on Retail the 1-120 leveling experience is just completely awful and abhorrent. There's a 40 level gap where you get no spells or talents, anything.
---
I believe the AQ armor is gloves, chest, pants, chest, shoulders.  So you would have to get T2 pieces that fit elsewhere, with one spot as some kind of leeway to share loot with other shamans or people on your tier token in AQ.
---
Are we only talking good items?  The luffa is a unique one it removes 1 bleed on a 3 min cd.  It's pretty useless for a trinket slot but still
---
I love that posts like these bring out the people who truest enjoy itemization &amp; stats :D 
---
Thanks for making this!
---
This guy gets layering
---
Maybe you make videos about decoy farming spots
---
Same.. I'm hoping they do the smart thing and go into release with no battle groups and then add battlegroups as necessary where low population and faction imbalance makes queues unnecessarily long.  Then you can match for example a high horde pop realm with a high alliance pop realm.
---
Hopefully, he reported that bug.
---
HELLO PARTY PEOPLE
---
I too played a hunter. My guild cleared AQ40 and even roughly over half of Naxx. I convinced myself at the time I was a good Hunter.
---
I've since realized I really, really was not. Decent at PvP, sure, but far from great at PvE.
---
I'm just gonna say you probably raided with 2 very poor hunters. It's statistically likely. Most of us were bad back then. Beating them doesn't prove anything in a Spec v. Spec debate.
---
That goes beyond what I thought of as player housing but I agree, this would be a very cool idea.
---
you burn breh?
---
He wanted me to go destro, I believe. I don't remember everything, but I remember him saying my shadow bolts should be stronger. And I was like... I'm 2nd in DPS by like 5% in a level 40-ish dungeon, and none of us even came close to dying the entire time. Either he was bitching just to bitch, or he legitimately thought everyone had to min/max for every occasion the entire time they were leveling.
---
That doesn't solve anything. You'd still end up with problems straight out of the gate where people can barely play the game due to so many people in all the same areas. Can you imagine waiting a couple hours just to kill mobs in the starting areas? I can't, that'd be awful, that'd be 10x's worse than actual vanilla launch 15 years ago. 
---
Someone else in the thread said it, but this exploiting shit only works when the server has an extremely low population like on the beta... Like the amount of coordination and timing you'd need when this goes live just to loot a chest or a gathering node would be pretty large due to how many people are playing at all hours of the day.
---
Can we all stop pretending this is just happening on accident? 
---
&gt; "Yikes!"  
---
Give me a break.
---
Cake!
---
Retail has nothing to do with classic. 
---
You are also being sensationalist equating a layering bug to an unplayable game.
---
I see you have been to AV.
---
Dude. There is a difference between them having plans you’d dislike and them outright doing something to purposefully upset the player base like he’s implying. Blizzard isn’t evil. So make it known that you’re unhappy with this. But don’t go around saying that they’re out to get you. That will get you ignored because it’s a childish take.
---
This is the real reason I think everyone hates hunters. That and wiping dungeons with pets and rolling need on everything.

---
No
---
 I don't know if this is possible or what the price would be to do this, but wouldn't creating a larger amount of smaller servers and then merging them after a while give us the same affect as layering without the potential gameplay abuse? For example instead of having a large Server A, we'd have smaller servers like, Server A 1, Server A 2...etc and then just merge all of them a a couple of weeks or month after release, to just have a large Server A.
---
I’m 26 as well and I’m going to half no-life on my weekends, and half casually play. I’ll be much more happy because my friends actually want to play the same game for once, and I’ll be more focused on my leveling/PvP objectives than wasting time. I also have already picked my race/class/leveling path to make everything a little more streamlined.
---
Same as before. I was already an adult with a full-time job and a house of my own when vanilla came out (yeas I'm that old lol), I'm already used to have to take my sweet time to do stuff in games.
---
I see it as an advantage though, I'm not in a rush so I'm certain I'll fully enjoy Classic like any game where the real game is actually the journey ;)
---
Lol, pretty funny.
---
Glad this is happening and getting found out now so they can fix it before launch.
---
Please, most hunters back then didn't even understand the most basic weaving let alone handling their pets. Your anecdotal experience from 2006 isn't a good benchmark for how a spec will perform in Classic.
---
It didn't "just happen".
---
mages bring way more utility and the most instant cast spells.  they have good QOL with portals and free food and buffs.  rogues offers a playstyle with stealth, energy, and combo points that really no other class has in combat.  
---
If I was a tank looking between a rogue and a mage to bring to LBRS I would pick a mage so that I get some free food and water for my healer.
---
Old AV still has exclusive items, more even.
---
Source saying they don't have it?
---
NE female Druid
---
NE male Warrior 
---
Dwarf Male Priest
---
Dwarf Female Hunter
---
5,000 - 10,000 runs

Even without respec, you want some decent gear to farm gold.  I used a big ass 2h to farm with sometimes on my resto shammy.
---
No, original WoW plans in alpha stages
---
Look at this post that i made  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bqd5zw/here\_are\_some\_early\_alphaconcept\_maps/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bqd5zw/here_are_some_early_alphaconcept_maps/)
---
I said i wanna look neat not naked in goldshire inn.
---
Oh, you get 10% while also making use of the XP. If you plan on getting the Saber eventually I'd definitely recommend it.
---
I did it once. I can do it twice.
---
That and getting the AQ Scepter and grinding my way to Exalted Brood Of Nozdormu (again) are things that I’m not looking forward to... but know that I more than likely will do.
---
Ok but isn't that bannable
---
Fuck Westfall. There, I said it. I fucking hate those god damn Harvesters and Defias Pillagers.

---
What do you mean proper laws lol, you think private servers should be allowed to indefinitely profit off of blizzards product?
---
Why is that hard??
---
It does allow you to sub out +stam for stats that boost threat when the situation calls for it though.
---
I had this spot for a while that I will not disclose. It was in the wetlands. I would farm mobs that had an extremely high chance to drop green gear that was level 20-26 or so. It got patched but it was LITERALLY GOLD.
---
Take up mining and skinning, while in your BRD pickpocket runs, learn how to clear certain packs to get to dark iron ore nodes. Also, kill all patrolling packs that consist solely of non-elite hounds. Tender wolf steaks sell decently and you can vendor all the greys and leathers.
---
We need another Cataclysm to undo the first one!
---
My first thought exactly.  Happy Meal toys.  Surprised to see such simplistic looking figures.
---
Glad I still have my Orc Grunt from circa WC3.
---
Looks good. But it would be nice to see BiS for PVP. This would also add other specs like Arms warrior.
---
If only you saw release day on Legion compared to previous expansions you would know how helpful phasing and layering for server stability
---
I agree. It would be cool if they added some zones that were lower level. Not everything new has to add to the endgame.
---
My first raid experience was ZG, so they loved fire!
---
Oh god... don’t remind me if that horseshit..
---
Can you stop pretending this is 100% intended?
---
Why can’t a beta have bugs in it?
---
I play druid so nothing really, I can escape from everyone except geared rogues who open on me while I'm in caster form and I don't see them coming so thats the only thing I see as a threat
---
He's a good PVPer and did a lot to showcase what warrior was capable of through all expansions. You may not like the guy but he is good at the game, just not great at the PVE aspects of it.
---
&gt; Many folk are saying Phase 2 will not occur till Jan 2020
---
OOf. 18-20 MC  and Ony clears before Dire Maul opens. We're gonna be stacked.
---
Liked this one, didnt like the other one you made.

Many kinds of medical personnel do in fact work without rotating hours.  Whether this all costs society more is a more amorphous discussion that would require years of study and data so I don’t really know if we can have a realistic discussion about that.  Abusing one’s own health “for the benefit of [the] firm” is a pretty existential question.  You mention being poor after working that much, and I’m sure some are, but I’d just offer a couple points about myself and why I do what I do: 
---
(a) I’m a young attorney with student loan debt;
---
(b) I won’t get into exactly what my income is but it’s a very good amount that allows me to live well and pay off my loans;
---
(c) This job that sometimes requires me to work those 20-hour days is where I’m getting an incredible amount of experience that will allow me to move on to a more stable, family-friendly job in just a couple of years;
---
(d) Whether one sacrifices their health for the sake of building their career is really no different existentially than, say, spending eight or more hours a day playing WoW.  It’s just a choice.  I like to do it because I get to see the process of big corporate deals, and get to do pro bono cases in my spare time.  It’s a hobby of mine to represent veterans before the VA (for free);
---
(e) Yes of course someone, somewhere benefits from my hours.  I get experience, some rich guy I don’t know lines his pockets, etc.  But guess what?  I’m part of a process.  As a result of what I do: People get jobs and lose their jobs.  Good and bad people make money and lose money.  The wheel keeps turning and the economy keeps running as it has, does, and will continue to do so.  The only difference is that as an attorney I have power to do good whenever I want insofar as the legal system permits me.  My firm allows me to do an unlimited amount of pro bono, which means I’m helping people for free.  I’m on four separate pro bono projects that demand a ton of my time, and I love that.  It is what it is.
---
Work life balance is easy. Browse reddit at work. Get t home log in and have an IV feeding caffeine directly into my blood stream.
---
In all seriousness. I've booked a week off for the launch to have a good time make some friends and get a foothold on what I want to do. After that initial week. Probably drop to an hour or 2 before /after work with a few extra on days off to get where I want to be eventually.

&lt;OTC&gt; \[Order to Chaos\] Horde | NA | PST | Semi-Hardcore
---
**Raid Times:** Thursday &amp; Sunday 9:00 PM PST – 12:00 AM PST
---
**Loot System:** EPGP + Mini Loot Council
---
**Intro:** Order to Chaos, or OTC, is a guild established by myself, my brother, and a small group of IRL friends. We have a wide range of experience within our core group, and plan to recruit a wide range of experience levels; from practiced vanilla and classic players who know the end game inside and out, to some with no experience in WoW at all. We also share a wide range of interests, from players interested only in quick and consistent raid clears to those that live and die by Warsong Gulch. Our hype and enthusiasm for the release of Classic WoW is immeasurable, we have been wanting to talk about ice cream for a long time, blizzard. Channeling this love for the game, we want to establish a community of other gamers that may or may not have endgame experience, yet want to dedicate their time in order to learn, improve, and progress through the hardest content the game has to offer in order to ***collect purples efficiently while having fun in the process.***
---
**What we are looking for:** We want to establish a solid 40-person raid team with members willing to learn the fights and show up on time so we can clear content quickly. Many of us are studying, working, or a juggling a mix of the two. We are all short on time these days and wish to run raids as quickly and as efficiently as possible. We understand other obligations can arise and don’t want this game to become a second job. But ultimately, our goal is to have a core group with solid attendance (80%+) that is also willing to put in the time to farm appropriate consumables/enchants and if necessary learn their class in a short period. Vanilla far more about preparation, not necessarily raw mechanical skill! Even if you aren’t looking to raid we still want anybody who is able to contribute to the guild in other ways including PvPing, dungeon running, leveling, and socializing. We love enthusiastic PvPers. Currently recruiting all classes!
---
**Raids:** Our goal is to form a raid group every week of solely guild members, progressing through content quickly and efficiently without wasting time.
---
**PVP:** Aside from raiding, we also plan to do premade BG’s in Phase 3+, world pvp/bosses in phase 2 and possibly some faction city raids in Phase 1. PM an officer in our discord, or reply here for any additional questions!
---
***Discord: sJ8MQt (Server Invite, Can’t post full link)*** or contact Fuego#1176 or Dev#0025.
---
Work and life? Pfft... damn casuals.
---
As I read this, post is at 0 even though there are 86 comments. Ridiculous. Even in the wake of the venruki video these idiots are still defending sharding
---
Hmm, fair enough, in that case it is not a bad idea at all
---
i camped that spot in barrens for days in order to get Humar, the black lion
---
Whelps! Many Whelps! Now! Handle it!
---
That thing was such a pain in early WSG. Anyone that had that pet back then was always ballin with level 19 BiS.
---
Not everyone enjoys playing the game half ass
---
You even admit you still had problems.
---
pickpocket RFD + herbalism + chests + kill the bosses
---
if you want to farm while watching netflix, this is perfect
---
How so? I feel like it would work fine.
---
Thinking back in those old days though, 2004-2006 was an incredible time for gaming with a lot of amazing releases that competed for the same attention as WoW did and it still did great inspite of that. However I dont think the younger generation will be as "prepped" for the game, since Warcraft 3 really made the brand well know prior to release.
---
Reminds me of the Nagrand talbuk grind
---
what would be your solution?
---
This joke is **classic**. Now it's gotta catch some of 'em in **retail.**
---
Well I’m an adult this time so I can take off time from work instead of skipping school.
---
I appreciate the endorsement, and I fully support others to do so, but this time around I'd like to play competitively.
---
In Vanilla I was a mildly-good PvPer that didn't exceed rank 10, and I was a hard carry PvEr in the form of a Hunter. This time I'd like to be better suited for both.
---
Enhancement was just a thought, but only if it could do at least 75% of primary dps, by going full sweat-mode. Since that doesn't appear to be possible, I'll let the idea die down.
---
To just not have layering.
---
I believe vanilla was less and current servers are only a few thousand more. The thing is when everyone can't just teleport and fly everywhere you actually run into way more players out in the world.
---
They only have one version of Vanilla; 1.12.  Go watch/read the thing about them talking about how it came to be.  A guy found a copy of it in a safe or something like that, they didn't think they had it at all.  They found a copy, a guy got it working, and here we are.
---
You are combining two unrelated things:
---
1.  Old AV was vastly superior to the 1.12 and later versions of AV.
---
2.  AV has items you can only get by being in AV.
---
People that don't enjoy PVPing, and are really there just to get their pat on the head in the form of loot ruined AV.  They cried and bitched on the forums louder than the people that loved epic battles, so they got their nerfs.
---
PVP rewards ruin PVP.
---
35 hour week isn't fulltime where I live. 40is norm I do 50-55 sadly.
---
I was thinking the same. But do you think pets would be worth as much in classic? I have a feeling they might drop in price.
---
Things that bother me most about these streamers. They aren't reporting bugs.
---
Awesome work mate!
---
I would love to see the stats if that is possible
---
I think i know math lol...
---
And i played hunter up to in 12/15 in Naxx vanilla, and cleared it multiple time on some private server.
---
I think the quest is warsong supplies, horde only at splintertree post in ashenvale. Gives some very good blue rewards that I usually bee-line for around level 25.
---
Opinions are opinions for sure, also I shoulda said "Season 2" instead of Darkshore. The Elite recolor you obtain in darkshore is a bland brown, but the one from rated PvP is black. Maybe it looks better on a nightborne female than a zandalari rogue.
---
Did it once... never again.

You don't really have/need healing gear from 1-60, you just need int gear, and there will be plenty of that.  
---
I don't think that hybrid would be that optimal, as for both enhance and resto the 5 pts from 25-&gt;30 are among the best in the tree.  I would likely go 31 enhance before filling out resto, just keeping a set of int gear to swap to heal with.  
---
That being said, we are talking about max 10-15% difference in damage, what you are suggesting would be fine.
---
I’m so glad I’m a banker &amp; don’t have those long hrs
---
Where do you plan to get all the gold to respec "3 into survival based on.....boss." Going to just hearth out and get summoned back between bosses. This comment really undermines your assertion that you know anything about Vanilla WoW or the raiding scene.
---
Arguable whether you should make the 10% way easier by being 60 and having regular epic mount :) But ye it's an option.
---
Tbh, if one is *really* worried about getting XP for stuff he'll need on 60 anyway, one grinds elementals 30-40, then satyrs 45-60 :D
---
Time to find a group is massively different as a tank vs dps
---
yes
---
They already monetized Classic once. It's called Retail.
---
Jokes aside, I'm pretty sure if they did something like this after all the waiting and the hype some people would actually drive to their HQ with real torches and pitforks.
---
You can't have mining and skinning at the same time without dropping engineering though.
---
not comparing, i'm saying that there's been many releases in the last 3 years that have flopped very hard. beta was a disaster and people held on to "it's the beta it'll improve" until release day. and it didn't improve. including some big name studios like bethesda, bioware/ea. ea.
---
"a tract of land along a border of a country; frontier."
---
I got downvoted the other day saying how flying was a mistake... people don't get how much less player and world interaction you get due to flying.
---
Don’t be too discouraged. If I were you, I’d roll hunter and get the best of everything. Or I’d roll fury warrior and top the charts. I’ve always felt shamans were great utility classes, but they rarely fulfill their potential.
---

Curious, why the monk hate?

High skill ceiling class, for all of its specs.
---
120 hours? Pssh I managed 99 runecrafting, this will be a walk in the park for the OSRS OGs.
---
My first green dropped for me. When I went to put it on I thought it said it would “blind” me instead of “bind” to me and I panicked and dropped it
---
Right, I'm definitely following where you're going, but if demand is high, and the price is high, and the exploiters are selling at the same price as the nonexploiters, it's just a matter of them owning a large amount of market share until their exploited supply dries up, no?
---

---
When I did the stress test the layering was really awful. Whole raid size groups of people were appearing and disappearing even if you were in the same group.
---
yeah for sure apparently even the people who weren't born was there too as well if you read the threads. I never said it was hard, and don't think it was ever difficult you clearly cannot read or only choose to read certain portions. Are you on the spectrum ?
---
Yes, it really is that simple. If there's too many people in an area or I have a queue to login then I'll just deal with it instead of cry like a bitch about it. 
---
"But I need to farm murloc assholes for a quest and everyone else is farming them too!"
---
Then go log out and do something else, log a different character, find some other low level quest to do, etc. I'd like the full experience warts and all thanks, not a diet caffeine free shitty imitation of the real thing.
---
That said, this is the point of Beta testing so I'm going to give them the benefit of doubt and assume they're still working the kinks out. Time will tell.
---
Would you pay more to *save* you from playing the debatly best part of the game?
---
Are they still staying this will only he in affect during phase 1? I hope they don’t go back on that promise.
---
Barbarella is a "fantastic" film.
---
Once the economy has matured and lots of people are doing raids, only a few dps (rogue, mage, stacked warrior, hunter) classes are good enough at killing mobs to make grinding for gold.  Everyone else AH trolling or herb/mining is best.  
---
Just running dungeons is not terrible gold, especially live strat for righteous orbs.
---
You kept the spec on what the raid called for, you either was making progress or had it on farm.... my comment was just in case anyone wanted that extra little bit.
---
I didn't say the layer swapping as a result was or wasn't intended.  I said the act of it happening was.  You are supposed to try to break things in Beta.  That's why they have it.

---
Yup, I think classic players have collectively decided that anyone who streams should be camped mercilessly.  Almost out of respect to 00's internet before streaming was a thing.
---
https://youtu.be/ekoDt_uxb_E This is kind of relevant and it might give you a good laugh too.
---
Horde always talks big, but never plays big.
---
I never cared for it personally.
---
Gratz?
---
Yes, as hunter you have the option to escape the fight 9/10 times so there is no reason to stay and fight if you get jumped. You also have track humanoids so it makes thing alot easier, your biggest strength is getting the jump from max range so you should use that every single time to your advantage and make them fight on your terms. Because honestly if you don't do that and then go on forums and whine becaue you can't beat certain people then you're just playing the class wrong.
---
you wouldn't really want to level as pure ele casting lightning bolts only.  You will be wanting to melee a windfury 2H or 1H and shield for higher survivability.  Earthshock is really good for damage through out leveling.  I kind of liked lightning shield, but some of the leveling spreadsheets are saying that isn't an efficient leveling skill.  
---
There are a couple good spells in ele tree that will speed up your leveling like the elemental devastation, elemental fury, elemental focus, even storms reach for better pulls and earth's grasp to increase range you can kite.  I think most people love flurry, but the problem is that windfury will each flurry charges.  I like a lot of the resto QOL improvements like 40 min ankhs and increased ranged on totems and armor on heal crits.
---
Yes. The act of it happening was intended. That’s why it’s a bug. It’s not supposed to work that way.
---
Yes, we are all on the same subreddit.  But that's not what we were talking about at all.  The discussion was about adding onto the existing continents vs the islands.of recent expacs.
---
There are tons of maps apart from those two. Fun fact, both the Black Morass and an early Old Hillsbrad was ingame since pre release. Apart from those they even had an early Hellfire Peninsula map ingame planned for lv 54-60

Jokes on you. Starting my 9th year at university, i have plenty of time! Ha ha ha.. Ha... Haa.

As you can see, the Marks hunters got butthurt pretty bad when they got spanked on the damage meter in their T2/T3 gear hunters wearing hand picked pieces and not did more damage but could CC and kite circles around them....
---
#r00fles!!
---
Lol, you could get to some pretty nuts spots with this.
---
Traveling wasn't even hard if you had your hearth bound to major city there were portals to all the zones there and by that point in the game they had 15 min hearths and toys that could hearth you etc.
---
I can't believe that's something people bitched about lol
---
Battlegrounds don't need to follow the same rules as arena.
---
Why is layering still being used on this server? surely their aren't that many people playing that layering is still needed.
---
Mag, Baron, one of the lizard bosses in MC, trash in BWL, trash in AQ, Twins, Mindcrontolled warlocks and mages throughout. There are tons more raid damaging effects in these raids too. 
---
You are right that a good player can reposition themselves, but often times that is at the expense of a couple swings. You may not think a couple swings is worthwhile, but with every melee getting those extra swings it starts to add up.

Not sure why this was downvoted I'm curious too, those 3 seconds freezing traps were weird

be way more specific, i made like 6

I did it once, that's enough for me.

There's no right way to do it, and no decision that Blizzard makes will please everyone. I don't care what they do as long as it doesn't negatively impact the economy early-on and give some players an unfair advantage.

this kills the kid...
---
Yeah for sure. 
---
I was thinking about starting in Teldrassil just to make sure to get the quest rep, but the wait to start the grind until I have an epic mount and at least Pre-BiS gear. There's a lot of killing to be done, greens and blues aren't going to cut it.

That's what I did I had a mix of PvP, T1, T2 and T2.5 gear.  I let other hunters waste DKP to get full sets.  Even in TBC.
---
and just have 2hr + queues for the first 2-3 weeks?
---
To wait for a quest mob spawn only 1 person can get at a time?
---
Nothing I regret as much as getting Bloodsail Admiral. Being hated by all of the Steamwheedle Cartel made getting around so much harder.
---
On another note, Roofles would be a great name for a core hound pet
---
honestly, i think what could help Classic thrive is after the Naxx release they update the map and fill in the classic continents. There are several areas in classic that are empty which eventually got filled in but stay in the classic timelines.
---
Example: 
---
* Eastern Kingdoms update: Gilneas, Ghost Lands, Eversong,Twilight Highlands, Tol Barad, Scarlet Enclave
---
*Kalimdor Update: Mount Hyjal, Uldum, Azuremyst Isles.
---
*Race additions: Goblin, Worgen, Blood Elf, Dark Iron Dwarf.
---
The additions would bring some new dungeons and end game content but tailored to fit the pre Burning Crusade story line.
---
Or just put tighter restrictions on layer switching? 
---
If you can only use it in inns and cities it would prevent abuse but still allow you to play with friends

I can't wait to auto run through barrens while watching Anime.
---
you'll probably start leaning towards mage with all the analysis you have done.  they just have good teleports which in the end game save you more time playing (no waiting on zeps or boats) than having a free 40 mount and cheap epic mount.
---
I’d rather have a skilled Night Elf Priest in the raid than a scrubby Dwarf.
---
Thank God.  That's just one example of how expansions, including TBC, killed the game.
---
Today you can rent the needed stuff on demand. It's called cloud services and scaling. For layering, Blizzard can easily open up a new layer (server) if needed. There are few big companies that can easily provide their needs. No need for own server machines that run empty once players abandon the game. Layering is so much more cost efficient when compared to "normal" servers .
---
Yes, clearly I'am just imagining you being very negative towards Blizzard and what they've said.
---
That's what I said.  This exact video has also been posted before.
---
Just got to hope you're dropped in the full melee group.
---
Yes you can.
---
To be fair, the adults playing classic back then probably thought most kids wouldn’t have the attention span to play WoW either. But there’s millions of young kids out there, bound to be some population of them who enjoy this type of game.
---
Layer cap*. And it was 3k in vanilla, so why wouldn't it be now?
---
There are a few games being made right now that I think have this mentality but my worry is them not having the funding to make them happen.
---
15k pop is never how the game worked originally, so why should it now?
---
You don't know what tactic the players are talking about. And you don't know about which relic the archaeologists talk about. As for Blizzard execs, it doesn't mean they are talking about monetizing the frostsaber mount though. Therefore, anything we say is speculative unless we have facts.
---
I mean stonetalon can be scary but the hordes there are lower than you. Try doing shimmering flats on a high pop as ally tho lol.
---
Yep. Beta/Vanilla player here. Never even heard about the Devilsaur Mafia until I came on reddit.
---
This would be my preference too. Keep a separate set of super-authentic 1.12 servers, and then have a second set of "Classic+" servers where they implement some of these things that would have been done way back when if they'd had the time and resources.
---
The new meta is shamans for all the melee groups.  So most of the time you won't be grouped with other mana users.

could u add the instance of the boss in ()
---
Yep, only because I’m forced to. If I had the option to do nothing all day and live off my parents and have cooked meals everyday I totally would. I’m a bit concerned my irl friends might get annoyed of me saying “can’t go out tonight” for the first couple weekends of release but I’m sure over time I’ll only be playing 2-3 hours a couple nights a week for raids. Sad, but that’s life.
---
Close friendships in the making.
---

---
It isnt Beta. Its a marketing event.
---
i started playing when i got out of the military so i was already older. Now, i am even more ancient and am settled. i realize that certain things in life take priority and i wont get to play every day and that gaming is for entertainment not a habit. I also realize that at my age and with life experience i'll never be the "best" due to time constraints and reflexes. 
---
i'll probably do some dungeons from time to time but i'll just be living in battlegrounds and keeping my 60 parked in some alliance  leveling zone to gank daily when i am not in bg's.
---
Please apply to design for Classic+ if (when it inevitably) gets announced.
---
It’s a bug. It’s been reported by most of the Beta. When you jump layers by joining a group it will pop you off your taxi. They will fix it by launch.
---
&gt;  it’s a fun thought experiment and it looks good but what’s the purpose?
---
Why does it need more of a purpose?  Can't you appreciate fun for the sake of fun?
---
My company it varies on the position whether you're 35 or 40. I think for a while and maybe still, we had some people at 37.5 hours.

Lmao me too in neon green or some shit

He's not good at PvP at all. Did you not watch him vs any actual good players? Hell he dueled bajheera before that and lost 21 times in a row (21-0).

Try* to do it, sure. Most likely give up again and roll an alt or something.
---
Him intentionally making himself switch layers is an intended act by him.  It's not intended (presumably) by Blizzard.  Why are you confused?

Amazing job!!!

Question: Do the Yetti's in Classic look that different from the box-art?
---
Legit my dilemma.
---
I think it's spot on.  I recommend you never wear a shirt again and show everyone you cute little kitty.
---
Yes I've experienced all 3 of those and Layering in the stress test and Layering is a far better solution.
---
Didn't expect to find grown up men calling apocalypse/having meltdowns when I clicked this.
---
They've been 100% clear they are releasing the updated lvl 60 set.
---
I was a hardcore raiders but I still not only did bloodsaol but the repeatable quests to get my rep back up with the goblin cities so I could be friendly to them and the pirates....
---
I still thought the wintersaber was too much 😂
---
I never said that. I said it won't change, it's already in beta. It's going live.
---
"...the merit of making players wait for rewards, and that anticipation could be an aspect of both immersion and player retention."
---
Considering the direction of retail WoW for years, this is what caught my eye far more than anything about day/night cycles!
---
Not correct for Classic, dailies weren't invented until BC, and the Wintersaber grind wasn't overhauled to use dailies until about Cata.
---
Wait what? Orgrimmar racial mounts were dire wolves unless I’m misremembering. Rams were for Dwarves.

---
Just like before, it will be both. I was an annoying 16 year old when I was raiding MC. On reflection, most or all of my guild mates on mics were definitely older. Now of course I cannot confirm the quality of any of these studies, but from looking around at what data is available it looks like over the years the most common ages of WoW players were between 20-25. This also extends to other main stream MMOs like EVE. Large portions are also 15-20 and 30-35 or something along those lines.

---
I would expect the player age distribution to be much the same this time. There are inherent values in the social interactions and delayed gratification, as well as personal goals in this game that transcend time. Not every kid right now plays fortnite, just like not everyone i knew played WoW. Actually, barely anyone i knew played wow to any extent beyond dabbling early on and deciding it wasn't for them.
---
Phasing is an entirely different thing, what you are trying to talk about is sharding, and even that doesn't work in a way you are describing.
---
No, you won't swap shards 15 times walking 20 yards in retail either.
---
Layering is sharding on a bigger scale (whole continent instead of zones).
---
So brave.
---
It shouldn’t be possible.
---
I got the baron mount in vanilla and wish so much I could keep it for classic
---
For pansies yeah
---
If you think that the influx of players to classic isn't going to rapidly decrease within a month or so, you are wrong. Spinning up entire servers just to handle the starting population is overkill and just bad. It's 100% going to end up with dead servers, it's happened before and it's the whole reason Blizzard is trying out Layering.
---
What happens when you end up with a bunch of servers at 10-20% pop of what they used to be? Not small enough to warrant a merge, but not the same server people wanted when they originally joined. Merges are bad not only because the process is messy, but because it's a lazy way to deal with overpopulation. You are saying "It's okay if your server slowly dies out and becomes a bad experience for you, we will merge you eventually. Hope you pick the right server at launch even though all of them will be max pop anyway so it's impossible to know"
---
And even with a dead and boring server, being forced to join a brand new community with no decision isn't good. If you are a solo player it's probably not a big deal, but if you are someone who tries to play with the entire server (i.e getting known as the main enchanter, a friendly tank on server, etc) it's incredibly jarring. No one knows you, it's well after the start of the game where you make connections, and to top it off you won't recognize any of the names of people you know because they likely had to change it.
---

Great changes, why did you keep world boes? Just seems counter intuitive with all the other changes you made. 99.9% or the player base won't have them.
---
I hope they DON'T do that, unless it's a future expansion like... "Hey, everyones wrapped up with level 60 content and it's time for an expansion, let's add more to the4 zones"
---
That would be fine to me, but, adding stuff like this DURING Classic would be a BIG no no for me, because it wasn't there during Vanilla.
---
If it wasn't there in Vanilla, it shouldn't be there in classic 60. Plain and simple.
---
He said he had a core group, meaning he didn’t have to look
---
Why would you bracket everyone together. That's stupid. You would still have each server separate when it comes to evaluating new ranks. Where and how you earn your honor won't matter.
---
This doesn't look right, I don't see T2 in every slot for the Pally
---
If layering is a temporary issue that will only affect many of the starting zones during initial launch and for the weeks following it then I don't see layering effecting most Classic wow experiences negatively. Blizzard is giving us back the world of Azeroth, but all I see in these threads are more reasons for people to complain. Whether it be about layering, streamers, beta keys,  or access to the stress test; most of these threads aren't a discussion but a nursery. It is as though people expect Classic to come out and be perfect, but we all know that vanilla wasn't perfect and that is one of the reasons we love it, so I will be on standby awaiting the release so I can go into this imperfect and magical world again and be around people playing a game they love while hopefully not spending 40 minutes per quest in the starting zones. 
---
Additionally and on lighter note, the posts I have seen recently about a layering bug while flying dropping people off in weird places just seems like another wow bug that I can't wait to experience for myself.
---
Thanks for the input!
---
I already have lots of time to play games. Games are my hobby and main media consumption that isn't something like a podcast being used during other times. Right now, I don't plan on changing anything. I can play about 3 hours per night, maybe more, and coordinate my life in order to achieve my goals. at 3 hours per day, I will be able to hit the 20 hours per week average that seems to have been the norm for players. 
---
Do i want to play sports or am i willing to forgo that for a season to raid? These are the decisions I will have to make. Beyond that I don't see my real life holding me back.
---
Yea, the first lizard boss indeed does rain of fire. 
---
Thanks for the list! I still don't think Titans is worth it unless it's AQ/Naxx progression or the guild sucks. If you're tryharding, you're better off with Supreme Power indeed.
---
sell a stack of 5 major healing potions on the AH for 999 gold for two weeks.  third week, have the gold seller buy them and lose 5% of your overall gold for no chance of ban. /shrug what they gonna do? ban you for selling major healing potions?
---
I mean thats how the system works... there are no Battle groups in vanilla.
---
Nah fam, the way you worded it can easily be interpreted like the guy above did.
---
Zhevra hooves. Fucking hooves. They're at the end of each leg and every Zhevra has 4 OF THEM.
---
Wrong region. Comment removed.
---
The disappearing and reappearing stuff is really gonna take some people out of that vanilla feel
---
You keep saying cherry picked gear but not providing a list so anyone can hit you with the real math. If you're confident you're right throw it up, maybe change the meta. If not please dont continue providing no evidence but barking at anyone that runs marks. We arent salty you're using a different spec or whatever you're telling yourself. You just arent providing any reasonable doubt that what has been established for so long is beat by something that on paper doesnt even math close to what you're saying.
---
There's a quest in ashenvale for alliance that gives you an item that turns you into a furbolg. When you get it just abandon the quest and keep the item. Much fun.
---
It, uh, builds character?
---
Why does that make someone jealous?
---
&gt;making raiding mc a lot harder than it is on private servers
---
&gt;just because they do that on private servers doesn't mean they're going to be doing it on a retail version of vanilla
---
&gt;My condolences, you think private servers are harder.
---
&gt;I never said it was hard, and don't think it was ever difficult
---
Whatever
---
Good shit my dude. Don't know why you're needing to defend yourself on classicwow. Hope your leveling isn't too long.
---
Wanted to buy a sword off the AH. Thought the "short", "long", and "very long" AH timer was the size of the sword. Not the biggest noob move but funny in hindsight.

---
I heard a rumor you are gonna need a subscription to play. Top secret stuff, can't reveal my sources.
---
Hmm first time I’ve heard that but I think only using layering in inns and cities would be a great idea
---
It could also be semi-instanced like in FFXIV, where you have a limited number of housing districts you enter through the city, but each district is itself static and can be visited by anyone, despite them not being in the open world per se.
---
I think the game that did player housing best was SWG where the open world was large enough to allow housing to be built *anywhere*, which meant people could be on their own or make their own 'villages' and areas wherever they wanted for their friends and guilds. Sadly I don't think that could work for WoW as there's just not enough space.
---
Because what else makes a person hate someone that they don't know and doesn't interact with them directly in any way so much that they would want to take time from their day to kill them repeatedly?

No it isn't. This entire thread is proof of that. You're one of those people who fell for Blizzard renaming sharding to layering.

Anyway i wont read a pve guide done by a dwarf hunter. He is raiding with 9 less agility, it's like 2 enchants.
---
60 hours spent leveling in retail is practically cruel and unusual. those 60 hours are sadly completely void of any substance at all I legitimately cant think of something worse than leveling from 0 on retail lol. meanwhile in classic i will level new characters all the time because its enjoyable and rewarding
---
I love tauren but realistically they are a neutral race. They are only allied with the Horde out of an archaic alliance that has long-since outlived its purpose.

---
I saw legion on release day on tichondrius. The most popular server in the game at the time. What’s your point?
---
if you're an alliance mage shamans also suck.  Especially ele shams.  Grounding totem + earth shock + ranged dmg = a rough time.
---
Blizzard has been slow to do merges on the live servers. They mentioned wanting to do another round of merges in a Q&amp;A a year and a half ago, and no progress toward it since. Maybe the classic team is different.
---
I feel like despite launch pains, we need to suffer through it to have servers with better long term populations. First day is going to be a mess regardless. There's no sharing of mob tags, so hunters and instant cast spells will dominate the starting areas.
---
because the level boosts is meant for retail not classic?
---
I'll never understand why they needed to make TBC when they had so much room to add on to as is.  Hyjal was turned into an instance like wtf?  Thats bullshit.
---
I'm not going to travel the world to kill them, but I'll kill them on sight.  I don't get why you're dropping the world "selfish" other than you're projecting negative characteristics on people you don't like without thinking about the worlds you're using.
---
I don't like streamers, they bring a bad crowd around them.  Nothing more than punishment for ruining the environment around them.
---
I didn’t say you said it. I said the original post I replied to did. 
---
Idk man maybe I’m just not as cynical as you. Blizzard said you shouldn’t be able to change layers without leaving the continent. This guy didn’t leave the continent. Therefore, logically, one would assume it’s not working as intended.
---
I forgot about him... Suppose I am gonna now thanks you jerk.

---
You're incredibly naive to think this won't make it to live. They didn't just go "Whoops! We accidentally implemented sharding. Drats!"
---
Correct.  The length and time for this will be dependent on how long layering exists. The real issue though is what they intend to do with the money. If a small subset of players acquired enormous wealth to quickly, then the auction house becomes way more manipulated. (Players buying out whole swaths of items and putting them back on for a higher amount.)
---
Herbalism in rfd?
---
But there were battle groups in vanilla.... they were introduced in 1.12 which is the patch that Classic is going to be based on.

How is it better than the other options?

good
---
Reading this comment chain has been really interesting. Your level of dedication is insane, you guys are absolutely nuts!
---
While I get that your thoughts on Joana's was simply to emphasize the differences of your leveling methods compared to his, but I find your answers a little bit confusing. 
---
First of all you point out that one of Joana's biggest faults is his refusal of doing group content, but you don't acknowledge the fact that the guide is constructed around a solo speedleveling mindset. It's not because he's refusing to do group content as much as it is due to the fact that back when he did his speed runs he'd consistently be so far ahead of the pack that there simply wouldn't be enough players to form dungeon groups with or to reliably find players for X group quest. 
---
Forming groups for earlier dungeons could possibly improve his times also, but I believe he choose not to do it as it would be a gamble for him to find the right players that doesn't hurt his play time by wiping, afking, playing badly or even griefing. 
---
Secondly, you mention his 15-20, 32-43 and 58-59 are plain awful. These levels are kind of awkward because often times you won't have enough level appropriate quests to stay in one place for an extended amount of time and they're also prime levels for certain dungeons. (WC, DM, SM, RFD, BRD etc.) Is your reasoning for calling these levels in perticular bad because he doesn't have his 15 warlock minions to summon him to key locations and don't have 40+ like minded players to form dungeon groups with, or do you say this because his routing is bad or any other reason?
---
If it's his routing, what would you do differently during these levels if you were trying to reach max level as fast as possible as a solo player if you were consistently too far ahead to reliably form groups for content? (I'm asking this because I expect to be somewhat faster than the regular player, but not so far ahead to make dungeon groups impossible.)
---
If it's because he doesn't do group content or have warlock summoners, I think your answers to the question comparing your guild efforts to Joana's solo runs is kind of missing the mark, or at the very least running a bit short.
---
Lastly I just wanted to ask if you're preparing for world first or if you're just doing this to squeeze an extra week of raiding into your schedule as early as possible. If you're going for world first do you realistically think you have a chance of getting world first? And are you comfortable with sharing your guild name here so we can track your progress on your quest for world first?
---
Either way, good luck with your and your guilds race to 60 and beyond. You truly deserve to be one of the top guilds with all the effort you guys put into this game. Don't forget to eat, sleep and to stay hydrated!
---
I agree current wowl is practically a completely different game. Every expansion pack is essentially its own game. Each new expansion leaves the previous obsolete and irrelevant. It's very confusing for a new player to start from scratch. A sequel would give them the opportunity to redirect their focus on one end goal instead of multiple different goals. Just a thought really.
---
Nope, fuck that. I did it once, never again. The standard NE epic will be fine for me
---
Feral druid has problems....
---
Weapon enchants: striking doesn't work on druid weapons. Should be agi enchants for both DPS and tank.
---
Hammer of Bestial Fury should be BIS weapon for dps in phase 4. It's not realistic for most people since it drops from the Nightmare Dragons, but is definitely better than draconic maul (see https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wGBasFY8fFGpBtiD1TAUBB99wxboCSVh5MW_6b_z0oU/pubhtml# , which is where most of this druid stuff from Pingaan originates from). This is of course ignoring that farming infinite Manual Crowd Pummelers is actually the BIS druid strat.
---
Do the Dailies give EXP? in other words would this be possible on a 59 twink if I started early enough? 
---
Sorry Im not familiar with this rep grind.
---
If Ayle or Josh are looking, please start to use your weight on pressuring Blizzard to deal with this. We're running out of time and countdown to classic seems to be the only place where people aren't afraid to talk critically of layering.
---
Layering is giving me a growing level of anxiety that classic is going to be unenjoyable.
---
FFS this stupid automoderator MOD on this subreddit. Sorry if i hijack the comments here i hope someone can help me .. my original text is :
---
"classicteam-noreply@blizzard.com
---
I dont have access on the launcher. I guess this is a fake one ?
---
Normaly i see those things via email adress but iam kinda not sure about this one.
---
Any infos? If this is a scam email consider yourself warned.
---
Weirdly enough it reached my regular mailbox and i never get fishy emails there."
---
Anyone can maybe help me? I made 2 threads on this both killed by automod because its apparently a LFG thread question
---
I played WoW at launch and server stress issues caused my server (Dalaran) to go down on day 2 or 3 and was down for 4 days. 
---
I really didn't consider it fun.
---
Haha im so tired :P ironforge
---
The elemental shaman gear makes zero sense, noone in their right mind would wear most of the stuff in those lists. It's basically just whatever has the highest spell power in each slot. That's like ranking arms warrior gear by whatever has the most crit rating, even if that's all leather and a speed 2.9 polearm. Nobody would gear like that, it makes no sense. The phase 1 pre-bis also contains at least one item from patch 1.10.
---
How is it useless lol its great in pvp vs warriors especially as a rogue
---
Must suck to not know how a monopoly works. Revisit primary school.
---
&gt; With the gear I had cherry picked
---
What gear?
---
More patches! More patches!
---
Patch it like you mean it!
---
That was the real issue.  We hadn't been in Azeroth for 2 expansions/20 levels/4ish years.  Then we go back and start teleporting between zones that were suddenly just there, so our connection to the world simply didn't exist.
---
EPL, Silithus, and Winterspring were basically max level zones in the opposite corners of the world in Vanilla, but we had to travel to them without magic and they were part of the world we were still in, so they felt natural and connected to our experience.  Sure, they sucked to get to sometimes, but that's because we had to actually travel through the world.  Instant fast travel is amazingly convenient, but is one of the most effective ways of destroying the size of a world, especially if you can get to exactly where you're trying to go.
---
ya when people start talking about after naxx doing TBC it makes me sad. Don't get me wrong TBC might be my favorite time for wow full stop. But in my opinion if they go with TBC after naxx it kills what makes classic special.
---
The survival spec also has a stable shot rotation meaning you can aimed shot without clipping any autos (assuming BWL Xbow).
---
Raw stats aren't the only factor.
---
Well, you know they have commitment down.
---
dude le mayo /10
---
How dumb would it be to go Troll Mage?
---
- I really want to get the white raptor before it's removed
---
- Troll is my favorite race
---
- There will be fifty million UD mages
---
I'll probably end up doing more PvE than PvP, but I still want to do BGs and stuff.
---
That’s garbage.
---
But then I’ll have to play mage
---
Takes up a trinket spot.
---
That's a £600 ips panel.
---
it wasnt 6k server population 15 years ago. it was 3k
---
Doesn't work, you will get teleported back to your original gy
---
Watching them comment on bugs, play around with bugs, laugh at bugs, then continue on for 2 hours doing other things.
---
Do you seriously believe when they're done their hours long stream they turn off the camera and go "Well better buckle down and send in some tickets about all the bugs I discovered today"
---
They forget about them 5 mins after experiencing half of them.
---
You use it then switch trinket... just like every other on use trinket
---
Didn't it have an ability to go slower or something?
---
Casual life for me.  Still working 5 days a week.  Still going to the gym every other day.  Still cooking dinner 5-6 nights a week and going out 1-2 nights a week.  Play when I can, when I can't the game will be waiting.  It will always be waiting.  No more expansions coming to take away my game.  A definitive end and all the time I'm willing to give, as long as I need.
---
They already had phasing fully introduced by Cataclysm.  They should've used layers over the original world so that Vanilla remained unchanged but Cataclysm layers adding "current timeline", level appropriate quests with the option of talking to chromie or another Caverns of Time NPC to revisit early time periods.
---
I understand they could not have added flying mounts to vanilla without fully recreating new versions of EK and Kalimdor though.
---
I think your right. The blunderbuss one no?
---
hand got caught in the toaster, pls give better instructions.
---
If I play a hunter, I'm probably going for Humar The pridelord, again.
---
so you start with 3k pop server, and after 3 weeks half the server is gone because they were just retail tourists (which is what blizzard expects to happen), then you have a bunch of dead servers?
---
My memory was they were planning on expansions, but they were not going to do an expansion for every content release which is pretty much what EQ did. The main reason for expansions was to keep the game in people's minds and on store shelves.
---
It's really not useful man but feel free to use the luffa vs wars if you think it's worth it.
---
And I'm saying why? Let people exercise their free will.
---
Something I have liked about these maps so far is they don't have the clutter of modern wow.  They seem like they ahve breathign room where as even though I enjoy the zones retail right now they often feel suffocating as every corner is packed with some 30 second event.
---
Will you expend it to lower level bis like twinks or op levelling gear for certain classes?
---
Fuuuuck I remember farming the Disgusting Oozling (https://classicdb.ch/?item=20769) for probably a month straight back in vanilla. I think I actually got it though. I’ll have to check my main when I resub. That being said, I doubt I can do that again.
---
I loved this, even had it for PvP as balance druid In TBC. Treants + these guys would confuse the hell out of a lot of people lol
---
Also was fun to use both during dungeon running too lol
---
which is pretty much what layering does, except the barriers are a lot more permeable
---
I wish they added more weapons.  I would love to see the Flail from D3 in WoW.
---
Only insecure children care whether or not anyone else says *woosh*
---
The corrupted oozes in the crypt have a 6% drop chance while the other ones have like 0,05%. Saved me a lot of time when i found out!
---
Maybe. But only on my Hunter to go with Rak'shiri like I have on retail.
---
&gt; **We both kissed** out on the raid group
---
go on...
---
Vouching for this method, I was *easily* able to get my epic mount and a good chunk of change on my Rogue this way through enchanting and herbalism on the original private server. Open boxes, sell diaries, pick grave moss, D/E blues for shards -- money came very easily.
---
The real question I wish would one day be asked is "how much monthly subscription are you willing to pay in exchange for absolutely no bullshit?"
---
Honestly jokes aside, charge me more and give me an actual online mmorpg, I'm so sick and tired of the nonsense.
---
This changes my plan of mining/skinning while leveling tho :(. Think it’s still worth it without herbalism? Sounds chill, my kind of farming
---
&gt; **We both kissed** ~~out on the raid group~~
---
I feel you, but chances are pretty good you can find a relaxed profession guild. I know my favorite thing from back in the day was to raid. I was 15 then and I could easily spare 4 hours a night to raid MC or Ony or ZG. These days though now I'm married and don't have the time to raid like that anymore but I'm confident there will be guild that suit older players like us, especially since this is not new territory for people who played classic 15 years ago. People know the raids, know the old tricks, know where to farm for the best loot and whatnot that it won't matter as much to try and push the content because we've seen it before.
---
I'm excited to play classic even it's just casually. At least I know what I'm doing in the game even if it might take awhile to hit cap I know I'm not missing out on anything I didn't get to experience 15 years ago.
---
Well met.
---
Noobception, you were using a healing debuff in a vanilla raid where there is a hard cap on debuff slots lol.
---
Streamers purposely court pathetic sycophants that will do anything and everything for a millisecond of their attention. These kids will have absolutely no problem fucking up whichever zone they happen to be in and everyone playing inside it. People are understandably not looking forward to having to deal with that kind of behaviour.
---
I’m saying that if blizzard allows you to manually switch layers, it won’t be built into the game itself. It will be built into the realm selection screen. 
---
For multiple reasons:
---
-	the most obvious: the point of layers is to control the number of players in each layer. If everyone can switch into a layer at will, they can overload a layer.
---
-	it would almost definitely cost more engineering resources to build it into the actual game rather than realm selection
---
Around 350+ is when it becomes good (aq40)
---
https://legacyplayers.com/Armory/?charid=348523
---
That gear is about the bare minimum you need
---
Prestors over ony neck but never lucky ofc
---
Melee weaving, deadzone, what to use and when in what order, proper timing to not clip autos. Just a few of the things you have to be constantly aware of to excel. It’s why hunters have the name huntard because so many people level hunter because of ease of leveling and then are awful because they don’t have the technical skill.
---
I like your other ones but this one's just STV
---
?? You delusional or what. Do you not see the value of removing a bleed and getting restealth or bandaging then switching trinket for free
---
cool troll poster
---
Layering is literally just sharding 2.0. It's cancerous and will be abused for however long they have it in. They should just make a bunch of servers and merge them once all of the tourist leave.
---
But as a rogue wouldn’t it be viable to keep skinning for a bit after 60 to farm/steal devilsaur leather anyway? So this may work out
---
Dude forget  this girl her entire recent post history is just her bitching about various aspects of the game. Trolls being trolls
---
&gt; They can use cheap instances with low capacity that are used on demand rather than paying much more for permanent big ones with a lot of unused capacity. 
---
With modern cloud and container tech, you typically don't need to spin up small on-demand instances for individual services, you can can take advantage of vast levels of multi-tenancy that allow better resource utilization/efficiency on larger systems, and you can scale your clusters (i.e. overall capacity) responsively over time.
---
&gt; Modern wow servers start dying whenever there's more than a couple dozen people doing world pvp, why do you think that is? Costs. 
---
That could very well be the case, but that's business (or architectural) choice they made, not one inherent in sharding/virtualization.
---
Or it was a mistake. You call me incredibly naive, I call you incredibly cynical. We’ll see on Aug 27.
---
Very nice, saving this idea for sure
---
flying = bad is literally the most popular opinion of all time in this sub
---
Imagine time is money. 
---
You see a car you really want, it’s expensive.
---
You have 3 options:
---
You realize you can’t reasonably afford the car so you don’t buy it,
---
You take out a massive loan and monthly payments you can’t afford, the interest kills you, kills your credit and you lose the car anyway.
---
You think you might be able to afford the car if you make sacrifices and save a little on the side every month.
---
Very curious what stat weights you are using to make this list. All the Druid lists you have (looking at pre-raid) seem off.
---
In the lore there was a “under karazahn” a dark mirror of the physical tower reversed beneath the world. Classic karazahn could enter this via the crypts
---
I raided as enh back in vanilla and I did just fine.
---
The ''bad crowd'' is their fault somehow? Also I never used the word ''selfish''. Streamers entertain thousands of people every day, unfortunately there's always going to be a handful among those thousands who are obnoxious idiots, yes but that isn't the streamers' fault. Should they just stop what they're good at and what they love doing because dumbasses exist?
---
Just look at his previous posts.
---
Is obvious.
---
[Got mine in hoodie form. :3](https://i.imgur.com/j2uNBdX.jpg)
---
&gt;  if a group of businessmen are meeting in a boardroom, they're probably talking about how to make business AKA money. 
---
And for all you know, in this case, they might *not* see this as the way to go to make money and hence may never be discussing it, because it's going to be a different playerbase attracted to Classic that's more strongly against microtransactions. So you are just assuming and no, you don't know.
---
Oh boy, here we go again. "LFM UBRS must have pre-raid BiS, inspecting everyone! All tier and crafting mats reserved PST!" 
---
Everyone likes to shit on how retail is played or how people have "retail brain" when it comes to certain things, but the concept of shifting community perception to be hyper focused on getting BiS to do content that doesn't require it is the most retail thing I can think of. That and people thinking they have the right to reserve gear left and right in pugs just because they sat in world chat spamming for invites, like that takes any sort of effort. 14-15 years ago if you advertised a pug that reserved dungeon gear you'd get laughed at because it's absurd. Really hope this shit doesn't get out of hand.
---
Best solution would be.  
---
Can only switch layer in resting zones or noob areas.   That would solve 99.9% of all issues.
---
Say it with me: Best in Slot Pre-Raid Gear
---
Druid Boy Chicken Wing
---
Low lvl :/
---
Could have been him, he hates the three trolls and reports them every time he runs into them
---
So you’re saying if my server has 4 layers, once I hit 15 I enter a world with 12000 players? I’ll pass
---
The streamers are not trying to do that though. It's not their fault that among the thousands they entertain there's some obnoxious attention-seeking idiots. Are they supposed to stop everything they're doing because of these dumbasses?
---
&gt; No, you won't swap shards 15 times walking 20 yards in retail either.
---
Is it 16 times?
---
I don't like how they made the heroes model's so much larger than regular sized people in retail.
---
I did it the first time. It sucked.
---
Ooga
---
You missed the /s
---
I cant wait for someone to make a xml spread sheet like we used to have back in the day
---
You genuinely think they accidentally added sharding... wow.
---
Everybody knows elves run through the wetlands at level 1 until they reach stormwind.
---
Lvl 39 is the required level of it. Thats pretty low.
---
Wow, dude!! Awesome!
---
Blade of Eternal Darkness from Princess in Maraudon is one that will be available from day 1.
---
Who the fuck is Ian Hasakomodo?
---
I hate the term viable, because it means a lot of differnet things to different people.
---
If you want skin devilsaurs that's a perfectly viable option, but you must have engineering if you plan on doing any pvp or pve, so you will have to decide between mining and skinning and in order to skin devilsaurs you'll need skinning which means you can't have mining (which there isn't anything wrong with no having).
---
Westfall.
---
You generally wont do it before lvl 46 i think when you do maraudon. Still really op that you can have it on a 39 twink

Gear is so sparce in Vanilla that it wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing.

Gear while leveling is so sparse in Vanilla that it wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing.

The difference is playing a NE priest is basically saying "I'd like to not have priest racial spells". They're rare because they're worse than every other race combo.

Caverns of Time is actually in Vanilla. Another unused concept until TBC.

Quasi's very distant cousin.
---
I used the blue tallstrider back in vanilla.
---
Balance can be done in PvP sort of, but it's probably the single worst spec for raiding imo.
---
ofc, ive bought that game, should be allowed to play it.
---
This is what cataclysm should of done but it only did a few zones instead of all of Azeroth
---
Imagine ganking someone in the 00s and then having a camera on their face to watch the salt.
---
Why? Phase 2 is Dire Maul and the PvP system. The pre-bis for both phases should be before the first raid section, otherwise the list goes "gear without MC/Ony" - "gear with MC/Ony" - "gear without MC/Ony but with DM." If anything, there should be two sections for MC/Ony since a number of drops are added to MC in phase 2.
---
This image was not the poopsock I had imagined.
---
Answer is yes either way.
---
cry more
---
I seem to recall there being a bug which did allow weapon damage enchants to affect fetal damage.
---
The cap doesn't matter. Layering=Sharding. There are enough clips already that have shown us that it can be abused and is bad for the community. Just release a lot of servers at launch and merge them later on when retail players quit, this is the best choice.
---
Competitive?  Yea, you will compete with the boomkin and smite priest for worst dps!
---
I had similar gear as that guy and was doing 50% more damage as MM spec in that BWL pug btw
---
ofc, thats the point.
---
Unless you have skinning no, with skinning nah but ull get a whole lot of Leather so its still a lot
---
This shit was top tier back in the day, especially pre-BC.
---
I think I stopped like halfway through revered or a bit more, definitely the king of grinds. I think I got turned off by the time BC came out. I remember just mindlessly listening to music &amp; chatting on vent to get as far as I did.
---
because they are annoying and entitled and personally it makes me want to ruin their fun
---
It depends, some things I like, some things I dislike.
---
Animations (mostly spells) is too flashy. It makes sense when your character is around the level of a demigod, but in vanilla it's just too much.
---
Water is too clear. You can't use water to hide. In vanilla you could because of the low max range on plates and water not being easy to see down into, making the dynamic a bit different.
---
Increasing the polygons on the playercharacter is fine, new sylvanas model is fine, I personally don't mind thosse kind of things.
---
&gt;The ''bad crowd'' is their fault somehow? 
---
yes, they encourage those problems
---
&gt;Streamers entertain thousands of people every day, unfortunately there's always going to be a handful among those thousands who are obnoxious idiots, yes but that isn't the streamers' fault. 
---
entertain thousands of moronic children whom we don't want playing our game
---
&gt;Should they just stop what they're good at and what they love doing because dumbasses exist?
---
yes ideally
---
Tauren are just objectively better because of Warstomp for pvp.
---
Night Elfs are better if you want to do Feral in raids. 1% dodge is better than the extra health. Furthermore Paladin buffs help kitty DPS while windfury totem has no affect and is less viable on horde because of this.
---
Also easier access to Gnomer
---
They were discussing possibly allowing you put houses out in the world so people would have to walk by and see them, they didnt like the idea of having houses everywhere but they thought instanced housing was dumb... then they went and tried instanced housing lol
---
the alternative being: joining and playing with your friends instantly?
---
Being able to complete quests without waiting?
---
Yes, the system needs some improvement so that it doesn't switch randomly but it is a QoL change that is sorely needed. It won't be removed.
---
That’s awesome, I forgot they had hoodies!
---
nobody likes streamers so nobody will care
---
Ally is on paper superior in Pve and ironforge is really well placed for anything but AQ
---
This is going to sound really weird, but something that I'd love to see is a BiS list that only uses the highest type of armour a class can use. I find it fits the class fantasy much better to be wearing that gear; for example, a Warrior just wearing plate, even if they're Fury and DPS specced. My Shaman is going to be Elemental specced and my Druid will be going for a 0/30/21 hybrid tanking/healing build, but my Shaman is only going to wear Mail and my Druid is only wearing leather. Like I said, this is for class fantasy reasons, not min-maxing, but at the same time I'd love to know what is available in those categories.
---
I've been waiting so long for the digital versions
---
that might be true but the plan for the expansions was already set while wow was live. there was a leaked blizzard intern sheet where they already had planed out every expansion till legion, was even the grafic engine rework included. only thing different was mop, that was supposed to be the emerald dream.
---
but the past is the past and i am looking forward to 2years of vanilla and maybe a vanilla content patch or a seperate tbc server
---
Repost and still crying
---
Not a quest, but I'll add Tidal Charm from the rare mob Prince Nazjak. It has a really low drop chance though so probably won't get it, but I'll definitely give it a try if I'm around those parts.
---
Blizzard done changed.
---
Not literally, numbskull. But clearly hit close to home if you're so triggered over it.
---
herbalism is just a bonus
---
I plan to nerd hard at start and hit 60 as soon as I can. Then I'll gather pre-raid BiS and chill doing 3h raid every week with similarly minded people.
---
you think blizzard can stop people form hosting p servers in every country on earth? of course not, there is far more sketchy content which stays active despite the efforts of powerful companie to get it shut down
---
&gt; The entire beta is probably just a marketing tactic in order to draw in more customers via twitch.
---
Yes. It is.
---
&gt; I'll be sure to remember this when the game actually does launch.
---
And? You aren't owed anything
---
If it were about total population, then they’d simply keep the feature...
---
The argument isn’t “will there be too many people on one server?” It’s “will anyone be able to get passed the starting zones without throwing their computer out the window?”
---
Blizzard never said, “we’re worried about server count.” They’re worried about a smooth leveling experience in the beginning. The argument now is “how long is this gonna stay?” Cause it definitely needs to go
---
Get this man a Blizzard employee ID!
---
You can have it though. Just roll alliance
---
Back in Vanilla I had 2 guild mates who turned out to be IRL good friends from high school who hadn't seen each other since going to college.  Neither knew the other was playing wow.  It was pretty wholesome.
---
As long as I can wipe on chess at 5 AM again, I'm happy.
---
I haven’t even done it on live. What makes you think I’d do it on Classic?
---
Shedo recommends weapon striking as well. It probably works?
---
shoot my dog?
---
It’s a shame they didn’t do a Horde equivelent to this
---
capitalism is ruining gaming
---
I'd have personally gone more demonic hellscale into ghosts leaking out of karazhan into misty bogs.
---
But this is cool too.
---
You are not really helping your cause lol, you are doing 400 dps on BIS prenaxx, on single target BOSS like Ebonroc. Most hunters deal 650+ without worldbuffs and 1000+ with them on the same server.
---
You should work at EA
---
&gt; These streamers don't do shit, they're just there for publicity
---
hmmm
---
I don’t understand. You aren’t missing anything. It’s not like it’s early access. Just do something else so you don’t burn out of wow
---
That's sharding and sharding is bad.
---
Plan on spending all my free time playing. Go to work, go to gym, tend to my fiance. After thats all done play wow until my eyes bleed.
---
You know whats the funniest thing, buddy?
---
**You didnt even answer the question about playing a Mage or a Rogue. You didnt even give a fuck about that matter at all! Haha** 
---
And that tells me a lot about you... 
---
You are not interested in helping others, you dont care about that. 
---
You are one of those guys who just likes to argue online... you just wanna try to feel smarter, picking arguments/fights... seriously you got issues, man. Go treat yourself.
---
But I guess that must be your true hobby, right? lol
---
You know what, as a "HARCORE" player, I dont have time for this.. haha
---
Good luck with your problems.
---
If you look at the recruitment forums, you would still think so.
---
Alta Vista
---
&gt; I also think tanks will be really in demand even more than normal during phase one and I have a priest friend and we're gonna charge ppl for runs at 60 to make gold while we get our pre raid BiS.
---
Good luck with that shit, what kind of loser pays for a dungeon run? Tanks are harder to come by but not impossible to find and druids are WAY better tanks prior to raids, way easier to heal, great AOE and high ass threat. At the early onset of Phase 1 people arnt going to be rolling in the cash, most will be saving for 60 mount or poor cause they just bought it, nobody is going to pay for Scholomance when they can just form their own group.
---
Now do a second best please ;-)   
---
for real tho, very great, instantly bookmarked!
---
 But yes.. would love to know what is next to bis   2nd or even 3rd.. because I Think some items will require Rare spawns or massive grinds for maybe only minor upgrades?
---
Exept there's other instances showing how scuffed layering is
---
Here's a big one: https://clips.twitch.tv/MagnificentFastSageMoreCowbell
---
Use that brain big boy
---
No, it's actually 666 times because sharding was made by Satan himself.
---
So: question. It seems like most of your zones are geared towards the end of the leveling experience. Is that because there is a drought of content for that range?
---
Yeah man, that +perception, camo, escape artist, and stoneform trivialized encounters.
---
Poor horde with their fear/charm immunity (DEFINITELY wasn't used on any encounters right?), +5% HP on tanks, &amp; AOE stun.
---
You can always tell about the classic scrubs VS classic players.
---
How does one even wipe on chess? Meanwhile Prince was an RNG nightmare for plebs like me. My hunter never got that now and I'm still pissed off.
---
My God, It's like the perfect time capsule early 2000's edgelord.  You even use gay as a synonym for bad/dumb/stupid.
---
There are different categories of objects that make up the world. All trees belong to a category of objects that does not block LOS.
---
&gt; entertain thousands of moronic children whom we don't want playing our game
---
Speak for yourself. I want those "moronic children" playing Classic. Because that's exactly what the community was back in the day. And if Vanilla could make those kids come together and form a fantastic community, then Classic can do exactly the same.
---
Whaaaaaaaa !  See ya on August 26th.
---
Alliance has it far easier with paladins. Source: pro vanilla paladin. Horde has to manage threat and mana far better for the same results.
---
You sound more entitled and whiney than any streamer. You dont want certain people playing 'your' game.. you think someone who engages with his fans and does things in the world of warcraft is some great sin, how is it any different than a guild leader getting his whole guild to go do city raid or wpvp ?
---
Seriously, this streamer hate is just sad and I dont even like any of em.
---
I personally wouldn't ever attack someone when unprovoked. But I'd certainly pay to see a ganker's face once their attempt failed or I got revenge on them.
---
These are brilliant. I really enjoyed all three posts. I was skeptical about additional content but these seem so fun. 
---
Makes me really wonder what the world would be like if he dark portal never opened. New timeline! Go!
---
idgaf about your opinion and I'm going to go out of my way to ruin streamers and their fans time and they is nothing you can do about it
---
Just like I said - jealousy. You can easily not pay attention to them, you don't have to care about them and they don't care about you. But here you are, wanting to ruin their fun. What does that kind of hate stem from?
---
You Marksmanship hunter's are all the same...
---
Follow this BiS guide here and spec Marks and learn to weave Aim shots without clipping your autoshot and enjoy your cookie cutter spec and don't piss off any rogues or feral druids by stealing their leather gear.

ps: I had 524 agility unbuffed with 8.6% hitrate and buffed my crits were coming nonstop almost, it was beautiful :D
---
yeah a flail dw animation would be awesome. some more assassins katars (fist weapons but there are just not many and none realy viable) would be nice too.
---
i love the d2 aesthetics its more realistic and not over the top like modern wow
---
going to assume you aren't retarded and realize world buffs/consumes /not giving a fuck about pugs are a thing so pretending a 1 bwl sample size matters is stupid as fuck
---
so you know we have to look at larger sample size so we look at average dps over both hunters for majority of their raids and the one specd survival is better overall - could ofc just be a better player though or pops more consumes on average so again doesn't mean anything
---
well I don't, so I'm gonna try to make it as unpleasant for them as possible.
---
I'm a little confused. are the retail and vanilla pictures showing how they look in todays retail/vanilla or how you would make them look.
---
Blizz should have went with a glider approach. If you played GW2 you know what I am talking about. I wouldn't even go as far as to say something like the Gryphon in GW2 would have been fine.
---
They actually said they would if, like with everything else, “the demand is there.”
---
Pretty sad to see that you want to gatekeep a game so hard. ''Only certain people are allowed to enjoy this game''. You have to realize how ridiculously immature you sound.
---
Negative.
---
What sort of options do they have?
---
I did it back in 2006 or so on my rogue. Then I had to take the time to get myself non KOS to Goblins again so I could travel because there weren't many other options for convenient travel between continents.
---
Fortunately, I still have the title and transmogs. I almost never see anyone else with it.
---
Idgaf what you do kid.
---
That guild looks like it would be filled with the edgiest memester kiddies. Glad it's on Alliance, won't have to deal with that trash.
---
What a dunce.
---
Wait, are you implying that Improved Aspect of the Hawk procs are bad? You do realize that Aimed Shot's cast time is also faster while it is active, right? I hope you also realize that it's a ridiculously good talent. You're getting a slightly worse version of Rapid Fire (30% attack speed for 12s instead of 40% for 15s).
---
It's the best for low geared hunters.
---
You need to switch to 0/31/20 or  0/21/30 once you got gear.
---
Literally a bug report button in the bottom left that goes unpressed...
---
This is why I fight for the Horde.
---
Troll re-post is troll.
---
I don't play hunter you mongoloid lol
---
No kidding
---
In the great quote of stan from south park "Holy shit dude"
---
Great work. Would be awesome if you added Flight Points
---
And continuously farming 2-4 green mobs simultaneously (spawn hogging).
---
[And also being able to kill a world dragon at level 10.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-jv1orcCVQ)

But it's the streamers who are assholes 😂

If you cannot afford an expensive tattoo from a good artist then you shouldn't get a tattoo.

I played Shaman in Vanilla retail and about a year ago i did a shaman on a Pserver. Both Times I played as a Tauren, first time i had no idea and just picked them because they were big. The second time was done by design. War stomp is honestly a game changer, pop a warstomp when on low health and get an easy heal off, or if you have imp ghost wolf you can just ghost wolf and run away to get more distance on your enemy. This is especially good for Resto and Ele, which you should be using as they are the best specs. I was meme'n it up hard with enhance in vanilla because i saw that shaman with the hand of rag...you know the one. Ended up doing Ele on the Pserver and DAYMN it melts face hard and was super fun and you can also spot heal.
---
While it's true that 1% damage is better than 1% crit, it's not a massive difference and survival adds more value than a few crit.
---
3% hit, 3% crit, and 15% agi.
---
If you can drop hit pieces from gear, you can leverage the hit chance too in favor of agi or crit.
---
At the threshold point, a marks hunter with 450 base agi will have about 7% more crit than a marks hunter, and about 35 more AP.  If you're in a party with a shaman (grace of air) and/or a marks hunter, you should easily out-dps the marks spec.
---
Another factor is that if you have the BWL crossbow, with a 12 or 13% quiver you can avoid clipping any autos with aimed shot because you don't have improved hawk.  Improved hawk is good if you have a fast weapon but not if you have the BWL crossbow right? 
---
Even assuming full uptime (impossible) improved hawk can lower your overall DPS since you will clip at least one auto every time you use aimed shot.
---
That's a yikes from me dawg
---
So, no competition?
---
Would you say roughly 10% faster?
---
He was addressing another guy’s point, and this is a discussion, is that not ok?
---
You should definitely go for dwarf or NE mage.
---
To bad I can’t purchase it digitally without spending50$
---
You can check for yourself in 9 days since you seem to doubt people who actually know. There is a new fresh in 9 days. Also if you have no idea of something, maybe just google for 5-10 mins before making yourself sound like a righteous asshole. ND right now has 11k+ people during primetimes and on Sundays is hitting almost 14k.

[https://www.dalaran-wow.com/images/media/naxxramas/naxxramas-ooze-frogger-event-01.jpg](The real animal crossing of WoW). They really did get inspired
---
Most of the people on this subreddit can't think critically about this. They'd rather just shout doom and gloom and threaten not to play.
---
Sorry but these aren't even close to right. A lot of those picks are just completely wrong and there's also items from the wrong phases in some of them.
---
The fucking bears in kharanos on N\*\*\*\*Dale are retarded long spawns

it doesn't matter if they CAN or not, but if every country had "proper laws" they would be able to.

Well, maybe?

Download Questie... Profit

Just play gnome and role play as a human who hasn’t hit his growth spurt yet
---
True. Vanilla wow is like the classical Greek timeline when gods lived among men. I remember ppl running after my servers first r14 warr because the inspection range was so low. It looked like notable characters had a bunch of fans following them around lol. Classic was special, and in my books its the gold standard of MMOs every other game and dlc will be compared to.
---
You'll miss out on about 1.5% spell crit at max level. You will have a slightly better match up against rogues, but a worse matchup against pretty much any class with a slow/snare (almost all of them).
---
BUT you will rep grind like a MOFO
---
What is the biggest cave in Azeroth? This is sweet!
---
Wasn’t this posted the other day
---
As much as I want to play beta, I’m trying to avoid playing at all—including private severs, cause I plan on no living the actual hell out of Classic come August
---
The tryhard spec? Is it really that good? I think having intimidation is more useful.. You may be right though, IDK..
---
its worse than gnome, you know that already, so what exactly is the question. its still a mage after all
---
That looks amazing. Great job, man
---
That doesn’t look like Thunder Bluff
---
Well, I won't say I am not surprised, given how huge the tree in redridge is just south of the bridge, but given I didn't start playing retail until wrath, and certainly don't remember even that very clearly, I will assume that you know what you are talking about.
---
im not a fan of this story, there wasn't enough making out
---
This is true too lol I was one of those kids having to jump on vent to raid with guilds and constantly trying to make my voice sound deeper everytime I talked so I didn’t get made fun of like most games when id have tonplay online with randoms. Wow and halo 2 were my shit back in middle/highschool lol and I’d have to say the older wow players back in the day seemed to be more accepting than any other community that I remember when dealing with those kinds of age differences.
---
Don’t you tell me when it happened.
---
ya thats cool and everything but where is the point at which you made out with him
---
sick dude.  i love subtle vidya tats
---
if human mage is that bad ill roll undead horde then :D thats why :D i really want alliance but if human sucks that hard ill go horde :D
---
He didnt say drop $800 into a virtual slot machine to get it...
---
well, in terms of mage races it sux. does human mage suck in general? no, its a still a mage

If you're interested in WoW Vanilla speedrunnign make sure to check out the relevant thread over at Barrens.chat

Its already 35 pages long and full of speedruns.
---
My hope with classic is that these unused zones are what they expand on for new content. Your posts of these today are just growing my hopes and dreams.
---
why is there no stage 1 raid bis? we cant use stage 2 because it has some items from stage 2 pre raid, would be way more convenient just having stage 1 raid gear.
---
Probably caverns of time. But for accessible caves, some of the bigger hives or the mines in mulgore or blasted lands I think.
---
I told you when it didn't happen.
---
In a later patch. Correct :)
---
I'm 28 and married. 
---
"Hello darkness my old friend..."
---
We do plan to have that.
---
I've thought about this too.
---
Mon-Thurs; get home from office @ appx. 4pm. play untill 6pm, 1 hr(ish) break for cooking&amp;eating dinner with gf &amp; walk the dog, continue playing until 10 pm. (bedtime)
---
Friday; much the same as Mon-Thur, except I will prob. be playing until closer to midnight / 1 am. (no need to wake up for work next day.)
---
Sat &amp; Sun; anywhere between 6-8 hours each day, minimum. (Realistically, prob. 10 hrs./day) Break from play for groceries / shopping / errands / gym.   
---
Every 3rd Saturday, won't be playing due to D&amp;D group gameday sessions.
---
over an average week, I'm looking at playing about 40 hours a week. More time really than I initially thought, and imo, a great amount as i'm a filthy casual and have no need to power-level my way to 60. I'm gonna be here for the world, and the journey.
---
I don't have kids, so that's not a concern, and I will prioritize at least 6 hrs of sleep a night, for reasons of mood stability. (I will also be investing in a smaller dumbbell so I can do some curl sets during flight-paths, waiting for groups, auction house trading, crafting, etc. and not feel like a complete lazy slob. I don't think it will actually do anything fitness-wise, but at least i'll feel better. )
---
I'd love to take a week or a long weekend off work to no-life it for a few days, but I've somewhat recently gotten a new  job, and don't have the vacation time (paid-time-off) accrued yet, so I don't see the point. I'll probably take my time off and no-life it when I'm ready to start raiding, rather than when I'm just starting out / leveling.
---
You mathematically did not do fine. You might have raided on your enhancement shaman but you would have not done “competitive” dps.
---
Doesn't work for me. I get into a cave and its just a silhouette, no detail. Clearly its something wrong on my end, everyone else seems to see it fine.
---
Is there an add-on that does this?
---
You told him when it didn’t happen.  Don’t you go doin that.
---
It was love at first login
---
Solo in ST to farm edgemasters, sell for ~5K gold midway through the server lifecycle.
---
Not a hunter but still enjoyed the rare companion pets. Pride and joy in Vanilla was a Hyacinth Macaw.
---
Mage bonecreeper stylus should be replaced by touch of chaos in ZG phase
---
intimidation is great, but not worth the 21 points in bm. your pet does not scale with gear, so it becomes less and less useful
---
Changing layer or shard should only happen when joining a group. That the simplest fix.
---
What are you using to try to see it? Our mobile support for it still isn't great so that could be the issue.
---
I think it's because these zones are for a hypothetical post-1.12 patch, where you give the players more stuff to do without adding Outland and raising the level cap. Most players will be 60 by then.  
---
Though if they did add a bunch of zones it would be cool if a few of them were lower level as well.
---
Its actullay more like 0.50% spell crit and a couple hundred mana. Just roll Human if you hate Gnomes, you're not losing much. Gnomes are still BiS, but its not the end of the world.
---
A Scarlet Crusade raid?  Holy FUCK I'm in.
---
Then layering sounds just like sharding but with extra steps
---
I honestly don't mind about something useless like a arena master trinket, but this "feature" can be quite troublesome at 60 when looking at things like rare spawns (e.g. dire maul arena bosses), black lotus, devilsaurs, thorium ore spawn points etc.
---
If this layerin "feature" stays in place more then a week, this will completly offset the economy. 100% sure
---
Just dont rush it... enjoy each level bracket and treat it as it's own end game. 
---
Get BiS for 20 30 40 50, by doing all the dungeons.
---
Stop at 19 29 39 49 and pvp until you get board with it. 2 years later or something tier 0.5 will arrive grind for that... that is probably another year ;) 
---
This is my plan at least I'll have ~5 to 10h per week to play.
---
[https://willitclassic.com](https://willitclassic.com/)
---
Yep that's the one.
---
it’s almost as if it’s an wholly unsustainable method of commerce 🤔
---
Yo for real though. I’ll be telling myself this all the time now. Leave the bar early on weekends to go home cuz I can’t stand the young hipster music and obnoxiousness. Or don’t even bother going out. I can drink at home for less money and play mortal Kombat or watch movies if I want. don’t like most pop music now. The whole “life comes full circle” expression is pretty damn true lol
---
Personally i still have a lot of time to game, but the issue is that I also sometimes have stuff to do so it's hard to specifically set of days for raiding.
---
I'm sorry but you don't have to get close to CC with frosttrap. You have a distracting shot that generates Threat and will make the mob walk towards you right into your trap. You can also easily make a reliable Feign+trap macro to double trap in one fight.
---
As for ammo and pet food; it becomes second nature and really isn't as hard as you make it out to be. Hunter was my first class and I never once forgot to buy ammo for dungeons, nor did I find that feeding my pet was difficult. You can grind so easily, the food is basically free and once they're leveled in Friendship they barely need food. Just make a checklist before dungeonsif you have a hard time remembering.
---
I agree that you can mess up a lot, but I'd still encourage people to try the class and try to learn. With the amount of guides there are today you can easily learn how to become a decent Hunter. 
---
Yeah there are easier classes to do more on when you are new but if you like the Class fantasy you should play it and try to learn it. Everyone can learn.
---
Nope. I only collect mounts on my main account
---
If the choice is between playing with a streamer who loves playing the game and wants others to play as well, and playing with someone like you who wants to gatekeep the game and drive people away, then I'll take the streamers any day of the week.
---
I'd most certainly say so, yes. WeakAuras and modern boss mods are pretty damn sophisticated and make most encounters rather trivial.
---
Streamer tax!
---
layering should only be levels 1-10 at most, and even then i personally don't agree with it. when you have to wait for shit you end up talking to people. It's like trying to anticipate a problem that you dont even know if its a problem while neglecting the positives gained from the potential "problem". If you wanted to implement something you kinda need to show awareness of what the benefits are of something not just the negatives. but people only try to focus on the negatives instead as justification. This is how we got to the whole "you think you don't but you do" thing in the first place.
---
Hide character names, stream delay, don't reveal what server you're on, don't stream lol. It's not going to completely eliminate it but it will mitigate it to some extent.
---
It's only fair to say "I don't like the activity that comes with streamers" especially when we see streamers encouraging their viewers to harass other people around them. Not to mention the swarm of idiots that constantly surround big streamers, it's like a plague of locusts.
---
Big streamers come with negative things that impact other players.
---
I think it’s not working as they intend it to because it uses the same systems as sharding. 
---
Idk man. Anything I say you’re just gunna keep implying that I’m stupid or something so I guess this is the end. Have a good day and I hope your enjoy classic wow in August.
---
We'd be fine with just normal layering. Why would Blizz want to impose zone-by-zone sharding when the alternative isn't two servers, it's just continent-wide layers that only change upon relog
---
Amazing, it has been on replay for about half hour now. Really good stuff.
---
And yet people _still_ stand in the stupid
---
&gt; we look at average dps over both hunters for majority of their raids and the one specd survival is better overall from first glance
---
Might want to look a bit more into that considering that the only fights that the surv hunter is better in AQ40 is Viscidus (where damage is irrelevant because you're just whacking at it and then popping sappers) and Huhuran, where it's obvious that the surv hunter wasn't soaking while the MM hunter was.
---
The MM hunter is beating out the surv hunter on average in every BWL and ZG fight, minus Jin'do.
---
This could be such a huge thing for the nerds of the future. I feel like it’s up to us to pass the torch now on what real MMO and RPG gaming is about to this next generation of up and comers like we were at one point lol
---
You should read the article before posting.
---
Bruh I’m gonna cum. It’s really worth that much? I’d love to see some big brain mathematician crunch some numbers and see what’s more viable, x amount of hours running RFD, pickpocketing and picking herbs in there, or the same amount of hours just farming the gloves
---
I believe in retail you can activate this with a console command and if I’m correct classic is the same client so this should still work.
---
Don't play with mods?
---
It doesn't suck. Its worse than Gnome for sure, but you're missing out on .5% spell crit and a couple hundred mana. Basically if you can live without having Escape Artist its negligible at best.
---
In my actual vanilla experience, all shamans except maybe 1 were required to go deep resto for mana tide.
---
he says "dude thank you so much. This guy saved my life, man" like right after the clip ends. click "watch full video".

Don't @ me cuz I love bitches
---
Competition would negatively impact everyone equally. This strategy at least has a shot at getting out ahead of the pack.
---
I'm kinda with you here. My major hobby outside of work and hanging with friends is already gaming, so really, there won't be that much of a schedule change for me. I'll just... not play anything else in my game library, mostly.
---
You’re missing his point, entirely. He is saying that you love retail WoW, and yet you are concerned with classic having elements of retail WoW. 
---
He’s just saying you don’t really have anything to worry about since a lot of us really dislike retail WoW and have a point of reference for the original vanilla experience. You’re entitled to your own opinion about classic, but it doesn’t sure seem like some of these elements like sharding should be an in-game concern for you.
---
Oh, and putting in an in-game shop or microstransactions is NOT even a point of discussion. It will never happen, no chance, nada, 0% chance.
---
So we are talking about server layering, and if you love retail than server sharding/layering shouldn’t really bother you that much. You might be excited for the prospect of a game without these features, AND I’m not the type of person to care either way, but his point is that it doeeeeeess come off as a little... bandwagon-y.
---
Eeek, brave soul coming into this sub and suggesting a change to classic. I hope you've got some karma you don't need
---
Mine was 60... I actually just spent the last few days levelling an alt and it took me about that time to get from 1-120
---
Ah; okay. I remember hearing that there weren't enough quests to get to 60 in Vanilla. I only got to 58 before BC dropped so I was inclined to believe them.
---
... than again I spent a stint in AV because I was a warrior and needed that goddamn spear.
---
DONT TRUST IT, there is defiantly 2 NEs in shadow meld while thier buddy is baiting chat in spy mode.
---
Yea when competition was fierce and before every good developer studio was acquired by the major publishers and console makers.
---
This is a really great option for somebody looking to have a great time in pvp without having to commit to 40 man raids. 60 pvp will be dominated by raid gear. Rank 14 will be unattainable unless you can commit 12-16 hours a day.
---
Yet she’s still highly recognisable.
---
Well I got downvotes for it so...
---
Yeah, but it just looks so tedious and boring, especially if you don't have much in the way of gear.
---
28 years old and while i have a full time job, friends and a gf i still game quite a lot. I work from 13.30-22.00 or 08.00-16.30. My "me" time is very important to me to balance the other stuff in my life and my surroundings accept that as i dont demand a lot from the. Just have to play a little less r6 siege.
---
As for the gf (we live under the same roof)... i Just never stop going on dates with her every now and then. When in gaming the other day she doesn't care. Just thinks im a fucking nerd.
---
I love how every response for layering is like "Have you seen 15k pop?!? It's miserable!!!" When the people arguing against layering aren't shooting for 15k pop or anything near that number. We just want healthy servers with like 5k players and no fucking phase roulette. Cuz MMO y'know.
---
Chrome on my PC. This is what it looks like to me.

Its certainly useful for classes like rogues and hunters who can exit combat to switch trinkets
---
2005
---
Your dedication to maps would impress emperor tiger star
---
Changes ?
---
Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee~
---
I didn't mean to come off like that, didn't know that I was. I am surprised that many are still on pservers though, I wonder how the server people do it, that ain't easy
---
Yeah, and once they get the snowball rolling, it can put them in a position of pretty extraordinary power over the AH, provided they manage the snowball reasonably well.  I guess my point is that the size of the exploit snowball will become smaller relative to the rest of the server economy proportionate to the amount of time that goes by after layering is disabled.  People who are just lucky or naturally very good at market manuvers on the auction house always have the ability to get a nest egg together, and then turn into a powerhouse that buys up all the runecloth and sells it for 100g a stack.  I understand that very rare mats are especially vulnerable to the layering exploit, too.  Overall though, I'm just not sure that it's all that terrible, in the scope of things.
---
All of this said, of course, if it's something Blizzard can fix pre-launch....yeah, get that shit fixed.
---
I'm not sure I understand what your point is?
---
I honestly enjoy rep grinding, but this one makes me nauseous when I think about it. Probably not gonna do it again.
---
You definitely can't not pay attention to it when they bring 1000 morons to cannibalize any zone they're in
---
been struggling with rogue and warrior.  I love both classes.  I love the rogues dueling power but I love the warriors mobility and hard hitting abilities.  if only warriors were great solo pvpers there'd be no struggle
---
You’re right. Also never look at parses or dps mate after an encounter either. It’s all useless information. Also don’t click-cast or set mouseovers. Don’t use addons like VuhDo, either. 
---
Like I said, you’re probably a bad healer. Sorry you’re too thick to understand that the more information you have about your play, the more informed decisions you can make around it.
---
He only has 1 (so far).
---
Naturally.
---
Graphite is cheaper.
---
Hunter with gear can become heavy long range hitter. So why keep staying just the little pest (yeah you are annoying) and move on to be the big bully guy that people will complain on forum.
---
Because you’re unable to tell when someone is trolling?
---
Same awesome idea there guy!
---
Who or what are you responding to?
---
why stop there... it would be interesting to create pre-cataclysm finished versions of all the Cataclysm zones (Grim Batol, Ulduum, Hyjal, Gilneas) or maybe have a real continental Kul Tiras (whatever that area is between Stormwind and Dun Morogh).
---
Same I just ordered my hardback since I’m extremely interested in this. Watch the kindle version will be available any day now probably
---
I feel like "Pets do not scale" needs to be a loading screen tooltip. Almost nobody remembers this, even if they played in vanilla, because the BC norm of scaling felt so natural/sensible.   
---
It is what ruins both BM and Demo Locks at 60.
---
Looks &gt; racials
---
Is this in the wow diary a journal of computer game development by John staats?
---
I think people's nostalgia is clouding their memory on how terrible and relentlessly grindy this game used to be.
---
Haha how do you rationalize stream sniping someone in wow as cheating. If they don't want to be vulnerable they can take less risks or add a delay to stream :)
---
Lol im playing a ranger, im just saying...
---
To the workers of the world *sips*
---
Maybe you’re just a raging nerd spergboy
---
There are repeatable cloth turnins for IF and SW to get rep on the beta guessing there will be for nelf
---
I almost forgot about how rare world pvp became after flying mounts took over.
---
Just wanted to let you guys know what I realized.. Not bashing hunters FYI...
---
Bongos is now called Dominos (I think back in TBC or WotLK) That is the addon that many of the streamers are using.
---
We will at some point. Right now I suspect blizzard is still trying to find out exactly how many is going to be playing. They said in a earlier post that premaking your characters is going to be possible 2 weeks before launch, so we will have the realm names by then at the very least.
---
&gt; They won't change the WoW:18month xpack formula until it's not profitable
---
You kinda just answered why there's no WoW 2.
---
Thankfully they've stated numerous times that layering won't be here to stay in classic. It's being implemented early and should be around for a month or two in order to help players actually progress and a steady rate through the game without having to fight over a quest mob against 300+ other people.
---
Not suggesting a change, although for Classic+ it wouldnt be a bad idea maybe..
---
ITT: people who did not read the article (as usual)
---
Just a stylistic choice, I think it's pretty inline with WC3's cartoony style. I have the Saurfang that looks like these, I can assure you that its an awesome, detailed, and hefty fig.
---
I cant help but think bloodsail rep worked that way. All for a hat
---
Hunter dps sucks because they don't have some random overpowered ability from a different game?
---
That's a very good question. A question we asked ourselves many times after the third wipe.
---
We'd been going since midnight, and the whole group was drunk, high, or caffeine-crashing. It was the best raid of my life.
---
It has nothing to do with being hard or not.
---
Do you really expect the blizzard marketing team who is doing the away to try and resolve an issue that you think they have?
---
Yessssir. And when the populations dwindle, just merge and close servers accordingly.
---
If Classic servers are still existent in 50 years, I'll be a happy old man.
---
See i didn't know that. Which is a Super Rad Idea. 
---
Yeah it would be really cool if we could reserve 3 character names on a server 2 weeks before release. Oh well, hopefully blizzard listens to our great ideas.
---
Starting a whole new game would not solve their problem, it would just push it back.
---
It is because their pets don't scale with gear at all and die to splash damage instantly in raids. You build a class balance around having a pet then give it no pet, it is no wonder it has bad damage.
---
Nothing wrong with it!
---
And how many problems you had with the game on that day?
---
Yes. Also my mage wants to bank in on portals so ....
---
* child *slavery*
---
Yeah. For a little while there I had hope that Thousand Needles would turn lush and lovely to make up for the flooding that turned permanent, but nah, the ugly was there to stay.
---
Not sure how this relates to my post.
---
Are you also a big law associate/wow player? I think I’m just going to enjoy the journey and hope my friends who work more reasonable hours will help me gear up when I finally hit 60.
---
Look at the ability escape artist. Human mage is gnome mage but without that.
---
Everquest did it with their classic servers I don’t see why WoW would be any different
---
It usually goes to whoever PvPs a lot and can afford to craft it.  Its a very expensive weapon.
---
I wish, but we won’t
---
Yes will list server names before launch since we'll be reserving 3 names on the 12/13th of august.
---
Yep totaly
---
It's just my constructive critisism.. If im incorrect please explain why...
---
Ah yeah. That is working as intended. Many caves are quite small so that's all it is. In an effort to limit questions about what do most of the boring caves look like, you can see all of them so you can easily know which ones aren't the boring ones.
---
Can I ask a favour of you? Just a small one.
---
It's not. It sells for like 1k max
---
That's envy, not jealousy.
---
I mained Hunter on vanilla, played quite well (or so I thought) for solo PvP but quickly found that solo PvP doesn't matter much in Classic
---
Guessing you didn't play retail past the normal difficulty then. Changing talents around is crucial for mythic progression raiding and each tier of talents probably brings with it more complex decision making and class understanding than a full vanilla talent tree.  
---
If you play vanilla for the complex and advanced mechanics, you're simply delusional. Enjoy your eye-opener in august.
---
Nobbel has a lot of good videos on youtube
---
You should find a nice guild and make a bargain that you will be a nightfall bot, but you need hand of ragnaros for pvp.
---
How about this - you, the player will suck if you think human or gnome matters.
---
It's better for PvE and still very good for PvP so go for it.
---
Let’s not say you’ve made a raid by saying “plonk, there is raid”.
---
Grim baton, hyjal and Tanaris has raid instances ready
---
I don’t remember a single issue. There was sharding. It was easy mode
---
Engineering is just too nice. Basically I would recommend you choose between either farm/steal dinos or doing mining in brd.
---
Nope
---
Yeah I remember getting the hoodie because I figured i'd use it more, ended up moving to Texas and wanting the shirt more pretty quickly, haha.
---
Empty server
---
yeah, this was funny. Until a month ago I thought that I had quit gaming because I grew up. When I started following classic I noticed that it's apparently mostly just that the game started sucking.
---
OP - think positive! You might lose your job or your girlfriend might move out or something. You never know!
---
Pets do scale with the player though, it's Hunters who dont scale that well with gear.. But Hunters dont need to cause of their range superiority, and utility... ALthough they could use more damage.
---
It's only your opinion. I grinded it in WotLK (was much easier, but still took some time) and that's the best mount in the game. I miss it playing Horde so much.
---
Look up history of Warcraft on the WoW wiki. It's a collection of a bunch of books that can be found in game, a few paragraphs each that takes you from Sargeras all the way through WC3. It's a quick and dirty way to get the gist of the lore
---
Because it sucks. Im not saying that layering doesnt and i would tolerate queue times at level 60 but in the first few days if i need to wait hours to get in i'll be honest with you, i would come here, make a thread titled fuck you blizzard, go on a rant on why i took 3 days off and couldn't play, say that they ruined it and probably not play again.
---
It’s funny that back then everything was overwhelming. The time it took to level, the amount of abilities a class had just to name a few. Yet over the years they wanted to attract and most importantly, keep, as many new players as possible BUT the more accessible it became, the more subs they lost.
---
I remember the days where we had to go through all those attunements in vanilla and tbc. Now you just walk into a raid the very first day and kill almost the whole dungeon.
---
Oh the nostalgia
---
I do know where Georgetown is, but, I’ve never played Age of Mythology. ‘92 is my birth year, though!
---
It's not that human mages suck, it's that gnomes are by far the best mage race in the game. You'll be just fine as a human though, not a big deal whatsoever.
---
Modern addons could be argued, but it's not the addons themselves, it's the player knowledge that went into crafting them. DBM, WeakAuras, and such are made by people who know classes and how they play and interact with dynamics inside and out, and help bridge the gap between the people who already know everything and the people who need or want some assistance in keeping a handle on all of it.
---
Wowhead is hugely more useful as a source of knowledge than Thottbot was back in the day, or general chat ever will be, probably. :P People know more about the game, know how to min/max everything, know how to make specs viable that would never have gotten a raid slot during Vanilla. Even if they launched with the *actual* 1.12 client (which actually, as the article states, had a much muddier, less secure, *less restrictive* addon API), people would still play the game ten times more efficiently now than they did in 2004. Private servers have proven that; they've figured out strategies for the Four Horsemen that nobody did when it was current on retail servers, and a hundred other things. 
---
People will stand in the fire no matter what addons are available to them; at least, some people will. Others will just know the fights better from watching 15 years of videos and learning how to avoid keyboard turning in that time. :P
---
Asking this question on the wrong subreddit.  Most answers already proven my point.  “jUsT pLaY wHaT yOu WaNt MiN mAxInG iS sTuPid.” 
---
I encourage you to play what you want if that’s the case, but you are asking what is the best for pvp.  
---
Gnome is much better than human for pvp.  If you refuse to play gnome then yes undead would be a valid choice.
---
On paper but good luck enforcing that. It is easier for Blizzard only to interfere when there is irrefutable evidence.
---
Whatever Blizzard would do to fight this, guilds can circumvent. The more aggressive Blizzard is the more likely it is to cause collateral damage, which could backfire into drama.
---
Lol well if you say it like that it sounds stupid.
---
I'm from the UK amd play on a US server. Joined a guild and grouped with the guilds B team to do some old raids. Turns out there was another British guy in the guild. Turns out this British guy not only lives on the same street I grew up on, but now hangs out with one of my old friends growing up. Was completely astonished
---
Yeah do it. And spread the word. Dungeons are the FASTEST way to level. Second fastest is exploration leveling
---
True, my bad I used the wrong word.
---
Don't you go tellin' me to not go tellin' him when it didn't happen!
---
Also I could imagine that killing stuff at 60 level with PvP and competition is completely different thing.
---
imagine thinking racials have so much impact that youre willing to switch factions for it, rofl.
---
I thought about this the other day and i would honestly like it a lot. I wouldnt dare creating a thread here tho  i can only imagine the comments already. But yeah, on the other hand it wouldnt be fair i guess. Probably individual realms like that could work.

This happened to me so much last night. i literally had to foot run, from Iron Forge to Scarlet Monastery last night cause the FPs kept kicking my off.
---
Yep, 120 is definitely not the right number.
---
It's hard when you haven't made a point.
---
Keep in mind those diaries have been said tinsel for 2.5 silver instead of the 45 silver that it is in private servers.
---
So if you don't find it overwhelmingly successful that's why :)
---
ITS SHUTTING DOWN AND POPULATION WILL DROP AFTER CLASSIC
---
This was my pet in classic.
---
the retail and vanilla pictures are how that area looks in retail and vanilla
---
Even if Blizzard executed adding that content perfectly, too many people will cry bloody murder.
---
And there's probably a not insignificant chance that Blizzard doesn't want Classic to be too successful and displace retail.  Something like that could potentially do that.
---
It's basically the only reason they exist, so whoop de shit
---
there are 5 posts now
---
Yeah I agree but one of the things I loved in vanilla was dueling.  I played mage, priest and druid, raided some and got them to rank 10.  The mage I got to rank 12.  I loved dueling and early morning solo BG queueing with my coffee.  This time around I want to be a melee and so there in lies the struggles.
---
Have her read Rise of The Horde, The Last Guardian, Tides of Darkness, Day of the Dragon, and Lord of the Clans; then put in cheat codes to instabeat WC3 RoC and TFT.
---
If she wants to read even more, War of the Ancient Trilogy and Of Blood and Honor are both great reads.
---
Specifically you.
---
Right? I hated the fact that important lore characters looked like they where from a different game, or a different race than pc's, I'm glad that the new models are finally on par with Thrall or Saurfang, I liked it more when the only distinction lore characters had was Different voice lines.
---
For an empty zone this might be good
---
For things that matter for a mage.... Gnomes get Escape Artist, Eng bonus, and Int bonus.  Humans have increased spirit and increased rep gain.    
---
Humans aren't that much worse really.
---
He's correct.  We've had 15 years to theorycraft, improve addon development, etc.  People expecting the exact Vanilla experience are going to be upset.  That experience ie impossible to fully replicate even for players new to Classic.  Those players will mostly be people whom played later expansions so they'll have more knowledge and be better players than many of us were in Vanilla. It's a pill to swallow because people having been asking for legacy servers since BC launched.
---
Sure am.  Here’s hoping it’s even possible.  I get home some nights so tired that I just fall asleep on the couch lol.  It’ll definitely take me a while to hit 60.
---
in hindsight that's defo what I should have done
---
&gt; Pets do scale with the player though    
---
Nope. No scaling at all.
---
Why is this being posted every five minutes?
---
Thanks for the input... That's kind of a bummer, was looking for pimping out Brokentooth..
---
Ya... I never thought it was that bad. 
---
Practice that kiting!
---
Did you even look at his "argument"?
---
The people moaning “what’s after naxx” are retail idiots who have zero chance of clearing naxx.
---
Classic players don’t ask what’s after naxx, they know vanilla alone has more content than most players will bbe able to handle.
---
It will take you average player around 2-4 years before they clear naxx.
---
Or is it your intention that we ignore casual players and cut their adventure short and instead start rushing out content ASAP once the 1%r guilds finish naxx like they did with tbc?
---
Stop with your crazy logic and common sense!
---
Of course NOT
---
Go outside and ride your bike, hop in a pool or play with kittens so you get away and do productive work.
---
Been saying it from the announcement of layering. 1-20 zones at the most and for no more than 2 weeks. Anything more is going to severely impact the game.
---
Phase one is likely going to be like 6 months.
---
never played past tbc. What did they change about badlands? What's special about it?
---
Yeah but I was going to use intimidation+tidal charm+thorium grenades to stun lock my opponents..
---
The content would definitely come some time after Naxx, more time than it took them to release TBC.
---
Your criticism makes no sense! The huntards dps is not as good in this game than this other game I played because they don't get a ridiculously overpowered ability that they get in that other game? How does that even make sense?
---
Because many hunter players are underwhelming.
---
&gt;Continuous free updates
---
Except they aren't free. They're what we pay for. Same with GM wages, developer wages for bugfixes, engineer wages for infrastructure. I don't really see what the problem is.
---
You realize that a whole lot of games are just something you pay for, and then you get the full package without a subscription, right?
---
I'm not complaining at all, but saying that the game *needs* a cash shop is ridiculous. The cash shop is in live to remedy the dropping subscription numbers because Activision has drained any sort of fun out of the game.
---
Hiding character names is pretty tough and ultimately pointless, especially if they play with other streamers - their character name is eventually going to be found out and if they tried to hide it so much, people are going to be especially obnoxious once they find it.
---
Stream delay is just not an option for a big streamer. The biggest draw of Twitch is the interactivity between chat and streamer, and adding a delay when other streamers aren't doing it would just instantly put them in a worse position.
---
Not revealing the server is what some streamers try to do actually, but like with the character name, it usually gets found out eventually.
---
&gt;don't stream lol
---
Yeah... That's like saying '' just don't go to work lol''
---
I just don't think it's fair to blame the streamers for things that are out of their hands and to be honest, aren't even that big of an annoyance (how often do you really run into a swarm of people who are there because of a streamer?) 
---
Just seems like envy to me. People don't like that others are making money and being popular by playing the game just like they themselves are.
---
It's correct for me - US, Eastern Time.
---
Same thing happened to me back in vanilla. Found out that a guildie of mine was going to the same school as I was. We met the day after, which was a bit awkward but good fun. Sadly he quit before even hitting 60 and I graduated from that school a year later so we never kept in touch.
---
The potential of mods is far lower than it was but I think the practice of using them and the availability will be far better than vanilla.
---
Another thing that will change is people making macros. It's far simpler now to make them, but they can't do as much as they use to (like activate another macro). I still think they will be stronger for the average player, regardless of the loss of potential.
---
Same, i am going to try to make it work as early on as possible.
---
Then why mention the cap?
---
Yes, and this is a beta, so report the possible exploits and get them to come up with a solution. "Just release a lot of servers", Blizzard are pretty thankful you're not the CEO of their company right now, just mindlessly spending money on servers.
---
Not wasting hours farming raid consumables isn't playing the game half ass, lol. It's a game we play for entertainment and if you don't want to spend endless hours doing boring ass shit that doesn't really matter in the end you have every right to do so.
---
&gt;  Instant fast travel is amazingly convenient, but is one of the most effective ways of destroying the size of a world
---
For the most part I agree. However, I like the way it was handled in FF14: there was high level content that required you to go through the lower level zones. It isn't uncommon to be doing low level stuff and see someone lvl 50-70 roll past you doing some relevant content to them. 
---
This is something WoW doesn't really do.
---
&gt; Those of you stuck on things like addons and other nonsense will ruin your own experience. Those of you expecting to relive your mystery and think molten core is going to be same as it was 15 years ago when we didn’t know anything, are going to be sorely disappointing.
---
Good article. Worth the read for sure
---
That isn't a solution. Nobody knows what the servers will look like until they are either over crowded, or undercrowded. And there most likely won't be server transfers at launch.
---
This shit better not be in any lvl 15+ zones. Like wtf I dont want the hallow shit experience of bfa in my vanilla!
---
I doubt it's real. We would have seen more people on here saying that they got invited. So far I've only seen this guy.
---
Layering in 1-20 zones at the most for 2 weeks is the best plan to get away from this mess.
---
Well I don't mean only having layering in inns and cities but the layer switching process could require a rest area.
---
That way, anyone you meet in the wild wouldn't phase you out and playing with friends requires a trip to a quest hub with a rest area where it doesn't matter if your layers switch
---
This. Since the release date announcement i find myself not wanting to play other games. I just want to slowly make my way in classic WoW, having fun along the way. 27th of August cant come soon enough.
---
Yes, the context was pre-established, and the prompt for the new subject the comment introduced, *the clip*.
---
I'm not sure why you're arguing against what is essentially grammatical fact.
---
Using the Stormwind Canal non-logo version of one of Teebling's desktops they posted over on their site.  Also has desktops for every instance.

---
Lol Ret paladins don't get to melee Rag. Ragnaros blows up anyone in melee range with a mana bar. If you sit with the melee with a mana bar you will blow up all the melee and wipe the raid.
---
But what does it meannnnnnnnnnnnn
---
Im not disagreeing with you. Youre right, you do have every right to do so. If you want to be average then be average. The point of this post is that people will play at 100% if you only want to play at 20% like yourself and have problems clearing Vanilla raids lol.
---
100% getting this no matter what.
---
Bonus to dmg vs gnomes?
---
Shaman is way more fun anyway
---
But what does it meannnnn
---
No. You can check the status of the mob itself (friendly, enemy, alive, dead) but not the status of any effects on the mob.
---
That is correct! Glad you went back and read it after all, usually people just keep doubling down oh say six comments down before giving up.
---
imagine being such a roleplay frog that you care about your faction rofl
---
Exactly ^
---
It doesn't boil down to the zone. But rather the time, the way they are doing it seems like a good way.
---
My plan is to prioritize my epic mount over basically every other expense, since getting an epic mount will speed up any other type of farming you can do pretty much.
---
I'm going Mining/Skinning and gonna look at a guide to get an estimate of how much ore I'll need to save for engineering and send to an alt. I'll sell any extra mining mats I can, and sell all skinning things I need. Once I have the epic mount I can drop skinning and should have most of what I need already to level engineering. If I need any other ore, I have an epic mount now to speed it up.
---
The only downside is I won't have engineering for any world pvp while leveling/until I get my mount. But doing it this way I can also farm my own mats for someone to make my devilsaur gloves/legs, instead of just buying them flat out. (I always prefer farming my own mats for things to get crafted. I'll probably do the same for Heartseeker)
---
The trolls in SE Hinterlands on their multi-tiered pyramid things. So much gold and cloth.
---
Lol thanks man.  Lawyers aren’t super well liked.  Sort of a family tradition to choose trades people hate.  My sister became a dentist and works for a VA hospital.  We sometimes compete to see who gets the most hate.
---
See ya in the game.  The real question is horde or alliance...
---
"That means I'm paying for it indirectly which is still paying for it."
---
And your comments heavily implies you feel "entitled" to get beta access because "you are paying for subscription".
---
You are basically getting a lottery ticket for free along with having access to retail servers. If you want to pay for a lottery ticket than that is fine. People pay for lottery tickets all the time, but they aren't guaranteed winning any prizes.

&gt; The point of this post is that people will play at 100% if you only want to play at 20% like yourself and have problems clearing Vanilla raids lol.
---
The amount of mental gymnastics you had to do to arrive at this is mind boggling.
---
/wave
---
Until they went back on their word and nerfed it to hell. So much easier now without Shendralar rep. Also, DMF rep is much easier to attain and no farming bloods in EPL. Its a casual title that I refuse to wear since they nerfed it. I busted my ass for it in Wrath and then they screwed me and everyone else over who put in the effort for something we thought would be elite and stand the test of time in the game.
---
What mobile support?
---
They have said that layering will only last until phase 2 at the latest.  Sounded like they were trying to get rid of it as soon as possible.
---
You have concluded that Hunter DPS in WoW sucks because of another MMO that had a Ranger class which had an ability that made that Ranger class OP?
---
&gt;Stream delay is just not an option for a big streamer. The biggest draw of Twitch is the interactivity between chat and streamer, and adding a delay when other streamers aren't doing it would just instantly put them in a worse position.
---
So, this makes sense with what I said. They have an option to mitigate the negative effects, in this case stream delay, but they choose not to because it makes them more money when they don't have a delay
---
None of this makes killing them on sight or corpsecamping them wrong. They can roll pve if they don't want that.
---
Well if youre still confused I can explain it easier if you want?
---
Are you trying to deny that you don't play at 100% when you already said you don't?
---
Are you saying you didn't have problems clearing raids when you already said you did?
---
How are you confused buddy?
---
I had her in Vanilla, kinda annoying to level up if you are already 60.
---
I prefer 21/21/9. For improved wingclip.
---
Do you recall how much xp you got for discovering zones there?
---
Most shammies I encounter are melee, but yeah. Also other mages. Mage vs mage is just a coin toss unless there's a huge skill or gear difference.
---
True that. Just as someone who hopped on board with Warcraft 3, I will always prefer Warcraft with Tauren to Warcraft without.
---
Not just level 60 resources, it might not be quite as valuable but there's always demand for all tiers of resources.
---
Not working on internet explorer
---
Doesnt the damage scale with the player till 60? But then I get what you're saying, as as you get new gear (T1/T2/T3) then that's when the scaling stops.. Right?
---
Just use basics of being a broker. Gameplay can be AH the whole time, I did play WoW only for AH for 6 months.
---
- Get a good AH addon such Auctioneer
---
- Create alts to play with AH and to be your store.
---
- Scan the AH like 2 times Trade Goods for a week before start, then keep scaning.
---
- Start your bids with low cut sales with high demand, never buyout even if you think is cheap.
---
- Put what you bought with a cut/demand/available, bank the remain stuff until you find a proper time spot to sell it, it will come.
---
If you are patient you will eventually have fun,stock and regular income flow from it. But remember that youre not the only playing the game 🙂 This mean that you can have 10-20 silver/day for the first week/days, then to 1-5g and then scale to 20-40g/day.
---
Honestly, I think I'm more likely to farm Baron Rivendare for his charger. If I get the urge to get the Winterspring cat on top of that at some point though, then I'll have committed myself to collecting as many mounts as possible and I'll have no choice but to go for Scarab Lord.
---
correct MST
---
It's also my favorite city!! So cozy in the mountain. This is awesome.
---
I meant that you chose the layer as you would chose a realm, and you would then stick to that layer until they are merged.
---
Nah. Once was enough.
---
Yees, I got that one on a Horde troll! I really wish it didn't have shit tier attack speed, but I might level with it until I can get Humar.
---
Paladins were better for end game raiding and high end PvP. 
---
Horde had better 1v1 potential due to racials, that is why a lot of those old school pvp videos are from Horde.
---
Thanks, that's pretty much what I'm looking for, love the clean aesthetics.
---
Yes, seems well thought out but I don't know enough about the hunter class to offer my input.
---
Layering is fundamentally just cleanly merging multiple servers. So arguing for more servers and merging them is basically arguing for strict layering.
---
Didn't know about this site thanks :)
---
I hold all the power now, boy. 
---
&gt;!it basically means "around the time of"!&lt;
---
I had fun at TBC launch while struggling to do quests in the starting zones
---
With Runescape you can tend to be less active and interact with the game less whereas you're constantly active for this wow grind.
---
Oh, I love this.
---
lol, noo.
---
There should be a breaking point, zones before 30 or so and the no more, might be possible that they cant implement them on a few zones only, if thats the case they should say so and say what fix they are working on.
---
It wasnt that OP, it was just kinda OP... Basically though I feel like you're talling me I shouldnt compare two differennt mmorpgss, EVEN though their both similar...
---
Lots of people are saying it’s not worth it to not have engineering. I agree, engineering is a must have for rogues. But it isn’t worth having it at the beginning of launch of a server. Two professions working in tandem to get your epic mount and to have a solid stock of raid consumes  takes priority. Then drop skinning(whatever prof) and pick up engineering.  You don’t really even NEED engineering until AQ in my opinion. Don’t let the douchey tryhards tell you how to play this game. They are cancerous.
---
He's a max level Pandarian, but never picked a faction.
---
I'm I'm same boat. Not big law but similar life. I think that's the benefit of permanent servers. We can take a month off and come back to the same server we left. After the initial few months, the experience will always be the same, in perpetuity.

Having laying sucks more balls.
---
Yeah, if they don't want it don't stream.  Easy choice to make.  They don't get to have their cake and eat it too.
---
Lol k. 
---
Keep a stupid thing in the game even though it makes the game worse.
---
Smart
---
I'm going to be *that* dumbass. After I do everything else, that is.
---
I played WoW from level 25 in vanilla up through Warlords of Draenor, missed Cataclysm during its window. I played the same rogue for all those years.
---
This time I am thinking of rolling a warrior and trying something besides DPS. Tanking sounds fun. Either that or a Warlock due to their utility which would make the DPS role more fun. Any advice on how to choose?
---
Uh... why wouldn’t they this isnt wotlk there is no reason to wear all mail. Mail gear is generally not stated for shaman elemental builds, kinda like how paladins dont ever equip their sets because they aren’t set up for healing.
---
Layering may be abusable, but i feel like dynamic respawns are more abusable for the *average* player. Johnny 2x4 is going to pretty easily pick up on mobs instantly respawning and maybe take advantage of it. But to take advantage of layering for your own gains might not even enter the thought processes of most players.
---
It makes sense... Explain why it doesnt make sense....
---
people have made it to most of the usual places on the beta.  Under SW, Hyjal, Caverns.
---
It's not just about hunter. "Give me a buff that doubles the damage I do." Is not only poorly thought out, but it's not a rabbit hole you want to go down into.
---
Currently using the [Dwarf/Undead](https://i.redd.it/evucm4q8oti01.jpg) painting by Kiba.
---
I never said Classic is more complex, I said that pretending the "new" talent system is some complex shit was a stupid sentiment ever since it was implemented. You switch around a talent for specific bossfights and that is it, just as I said.
---
I'm also not delusional, I won't need an eye-opener.
---
Yes, Are modern mods too strong?  Don't play with them if you feel they make the game too easy.  if players want their hand held they will.  Things like quest helper with arrows pointing where you need to go were available to hold peoples hands back then too, but i just choose not to use them.  Mods like DBM were required by certain guilds, but not every guild, and I often raided without it.
---
I thought internet explorer was only used to download chrome/firefox.
---
There's already the Swamp of Sorrows. Although having a more swampy jungle would help distinguish this zone from the rest of Stranglethorn. Right now it seems practically identical.
---
Why do I do this to myself? 
---
I really should not partake in a discussion involving dps'ers.
---
Your memory is clearly faulty here, as this is not how loot tables in WoW have ever worked.
---
Nice! The Morpheus font!
---
Layering is world wide and will last till phase 2 which could be a few months. People are upset because of the potential for abuse as seen in the video.
---
No one seems to be giving you any answers for your grenade questions, so I'll pipe up. More stuns are always good. Just because you have grenades (1 min cooldown) doesn't mean you won't want to warstomp later. *Sure* grenades can replace warstomp, but grenades can't replace Grenades + Warstomp.
---
Additionally, with both, you can save your grenades to heal yourself, and use your stun for damage, as grenades only incapacitate. 
---
Lastly, people keep bringing up Tauren size with only half the information. Increased melee size is always a plus, and while it does work as a disadvantage if you're healing / ele as melee will be able to hit you from farther away, you can always negate this with a Noggenfogger's flask, or a Savory Delight — this will adjust your hitbox size to normal, thus allowing you to choose when and where you take advantage of your increased hitbox.
---
Hell to the no.
---
lmao you unironically got downvoted for posting the truth. https://www.twitch.tv/moo_uk/clip/JazzyFreezingRatDatSheffy?filter=clips&amp;range=30d&amp;sort=time yeah layering hasn't been an issue up until now and everything's under control /s ... everything's fine boys.
---
Whew. Glad you made that comment. I was staring at it for over a minute trying to decide if it was grammatically acceptable. 
---
Interesting to note: in a dash online, sometimes apostrophes are omitted... youre, aren't, Im, and whore.
---
True. It would be like if Tom Brady wore his own jersey to the grocery store.
---
Imagine not being able to play classic because you dislike the idea of layering affecting you slightly every couple play sessions.
---
Or assuming that maybe the tech can be cleaned up and fixed in a beta specifically designed to do that.
---
If you can't handle layering as a bandaid so that we can play at launch and not have dead servers afterwards, just leave the sub and don't play, because layering is required and it's staying.
---
It takes nore
---
Yeah I think you're thinking about this more than I am, I just know we're going to gank streamers because it makes people salty and that's the point of ganking.
---
Because it's the honroable thing to do...
---
This is what ironforge thinks it looks like
---
Yeah, it needs something to make it stand out. STV is already a *huge* zone.
---
Sorry got the companies confused. Corrected it.
---
TBH I wish it had a bfa graphics toggle
---
The art of BfA is fucking amazing in general.
---
Honestly visually the best expansion for me. The locations, the more realistic sets, heritage armour. Damn.
---
You should stop being an incel.
---
Ah the mighty halls of Lagforge.
---
My first toon I ever made was a Night Elf warrior that did the corpse run across the wetlands to level in the Dwarven lands so definitely nostalgic.
---
Thanks. I have a general idea of most of the pre-wow lore, but it's been so long a refresher will be nice.
---
Just really depends if you want escape artist or stoneform imo.
---
I thought I wanted Vanilla wow and then I got invited to the stress test... I have a job and am just buying a house. WoW is a slippery slope of never ending time played and the stress test just reminded me how easy it can be to get lost forever playing. I absolutely love every minute of it but it could be a death sentence for the life I'm slowly building.
---
Can't wait to gank retards like you :D
---
Same as in, you can tell me with certainty that only 100% drop items are group shared?
---
Agreed, should plan on 2-3 years
---
Lose endless hours of meaningful progression, just to skin my frostsaber?  Hard pass
---
You make it sound as though you're just trying to do noble deeds and make my life better, but what you're really doing is displaying some kind of god complex and telling me how to live my life.
---
Taking away my power to make decisions for myself isn't 'help,' it's oppression.  wtf is wrong with you.
---
Back in vanilla we gave all ours to shaman and gave them the mats for it since we had plenty and its a great pvp weapon for them.
---
I hate the fact that from 80 and onwards, you gain no new skills save the talents. Its just, oh another level now I can enter this dungeon. Nothing like I now have ghost wolf or some other class defining ability/skill.
---
I'm replaying WC3, but I understand that's not exactly expedient.
---
No, a packed server wouldn't be fun, because sitting in queue and laggy servers aren't fun. Nor is being unable to do content.
---
It will be packed enough even with layering. Nobody is stopping you from dicking around the starting area talking to people, don't force it on the rest of us
---
Seems like it was more of a proc effect to offer the possibility of auto attacking twice which doesn't = double damage. Seems impractical nonetheless
---
Correct. They were only used when pushing new content. It wasn't economically viable to use them for farming.
---
We also have a lot more knowledge so the time we have to invest will be a lot less.
---
You say that Hunter DPS sucks. Hunter DPS sucks compared to what? Compared to other classes in WoW? If so then your conclusion should be related to comparing Hunter DPS to other classes in WoW.
---
Instead what you have said is that Hunter DPS sucks compared to Ranger DPS in another game. You may have well said that Hunter DPS sucks compared to Thanos DPS because Thanos has an OP SNAP ability that lets him insta-kill half of the universe, and a good solution would be to give Hunters the SNAP ability.
---
I don’t think I could get it even if I wanted to. I’m a horde player. Hey believe this is only for alliance
---
Are you saying you would respec to farm? Normal raid spec resto shaman can't use 2 handed maces so that sounds counter productive, better to level an alt hunter/mage.
---
they had this idea aleady.
---
Ive heard talks from people i know in the industry from people i trust that they are going to sell items similar to the contracts we have today to up rep gains for shit that was considered hard back then, like timbermaw and shit.
---
Not only impractical, but I know EXACTLY where it's going to lead. 1 dps class gets a jelly bean, the other dps class will want a slice of pie, then a cake, then...
---
I'll always remember my first moment of aw in this game. Finding the deeprun tram and then emerging into the Great Forge.
---
That should be a choice, not a requirement.
---
It's an MMO, why force people on rails, the exact criticism people have about retail.
---
🤨 it boggles my mind how people are so dead set on making classic shitty for no good reason
---
Still no ret Pala :(
---
sorry never seen this orb. where is it located and what does it do?
---
I love this artwork so much. Feels so much more massive and cavernous than the in-game Ironforge, and somehow, more like a depiction of a realistic space than a videogame space.
---
I dont care if you gank them, red is dead in my book. All I'm saying is the hate for them is silly... what I really didn't like was the "we dont want them playing our game anyway" comment. That's a dumb as fuck opinion.
---
Hi saying is the hate for them is silly... what i really didn't like was the "we dont want them playing our game anyway" comment. that's a dumb as fuck opinion., I'm dad.
---
This is my favorite yet. Would have loved hopping from Plaguelands to here like a natural story progression to 60. Keep these up!! Hope we see some in 1.13. ;)
---
Every time I am convinced I'll be playing Horde, I end up being reminded of how much I prefer Alliance cities.
---
Lol right? Steal a map, slap your logo on it, pretend you made it. The lifestyle of a "content creator".
---
If there are servers with 1 hr queues, then hopefully Blizz will allow transfers quickly
---
You can RP all you want by wearing that gear. Nothing stopping you from doing that.
---
On every character I did and I will again!!
---
people overestimating racials impact to such a degree where they dont play the race they " love how humans look and animations and everything" is just absurd to me, nothing to do about lore.   
---
although i cant imagine switching factions because i would loose the opportunity to play with dozens of friends.
---
To be fair, it is largely an advertising stunt... as far as a game's business model goes. Its neither surprising nor alarming that beta invites were handed out to streamers and influencers. It's just smart business, that's all.
---
I'm in the beta by the way!
---
Fucking impressive.
---
I'd like to see step by step guides so we call all exploit it before phase 2
---
For the horde brother! Your doing God’s work.
---
Gnome is the best. Hunters/Druids/Mages are all a huge pain to rogues in world pvp. 1min cd snare removal is easily the best alliance racial.
---
I always wonder how that could have been implemented in a meaningful way. I mean I love it in single player RPG like The elder scrolls or fable, but how could you do it in an mmo? Has it been done in others successfully?
---
Some people feel impressed with themselves doing 14 year old content faster than others 🤣
---
No, I wouldn't typically respec.   My spec was something like 0/11/50.   You lose a bit of magic damage reduction in the elemental tree, but it's not essential to raiding.
---
Dude, all online games have this. Without a monthly fee. Don't defend what's wrong with todays gaming industry. That's whats make them push the limit even further.
---
Warrior, very slow, 1 hour per week:
---
August 2031.
---
There is a rare white lion you can get as a horde hunter in one of the northern barrens quests
---
The elder scrolls online and FF14 have done it.
---
Aight man, that's chill.  I can get along with that opinion.
---
I was responding to you saying many players considered it a chore by saying "good" and giving a reason why I thought it was good it was looked at as a chore.  Sure it was a bit of a stream of consciousness, but I don't see how you could read my whole post and not see how it is directly related to what you said.
---
It was small enough that you would remember guild names.
---
Insert “Those who honestly acquired the Scarab Lord title &amp; mount” here.
---
&gt;That Orc Warrior atop Orgrimmar bank in full Wrath wielding Ashkandi won't stand out anymore.
---
Yes it will.
---
People assume 90% of wow players raid...
---
Not remotely close.
---
How was it received? I haven’t played either of those
---
Im going to find a way to abuse this layering until they finally take it out.
---
I did it in a private server...promised not to do it again ever...probably going to do it
---
No that’s perfect - thanks very much

Oh, I wasn't totally serious.  I've always played Horde, I'm an incredibly biased source of information.
---
I haven't played enough of either to know personally, but I do recall seeing articles or snippets on reddit in the past saying the communities really enjoyed them.
---
The formula is used to compare gear of different stats. Lets say you have one item that has +10 INT +10 spirit + 20 healing, and another item with +6 Mp5 and + 10 INT + 1 % crit drops. Which item should you use?
---
By using the formula above, the item you have already equipped equals to about 12+4+20= 36 healing
---
The other item equals to 21+ 4+ 8= 33 healing. So your current item is theoretically better. (For fights where all you do is healing).
---
Uhhh.... source to any of this?
---
The greatest crossover episode of my time
---
Thanks :)
---
The sheer level of entitlement. Holy shit. 
---
"Nonsensical biases" in the same sentence as "finances and ease of administration" dude my sides are in fucking orbit. My bad dude, I'll pretend as you do that money isn't a concern and that we're all rich here. I don't know if I want to tell you to go lead a project, to get some experience under your belt, or to never lead anything at all, for fear of what you'll end up doing to your team. Either way, the real world is well outside your field of expertise.
---
There's nothing to talk about. There's no transmog in Classic.
---
I can see why someone could think this, since a fair bit of the game's design was inspired by other games. Maybe it's not the best take or whatever, but the hypothesis makes sense regardless of how on or off it actually is.
---
It's a beta. They're testing the technology. It's not going to work properly yet.
---
Frankly I'm surprised it works that well already. Kudos blizzard! The amount of work that goes into something like this is amazing. 
---
It's so awesome to see new technology developed in front of us and being able to be a part of it. 
---
I am totally awestruck at the whole concept of layering - I work in networking so to me, the thought of a system that can dynamically balance user loads like this, on the fly, is amazing to me. 
---
This makes me really excited that its already working this well
---
How about checking if you have a target. I'm having a problem with a macro that targets the closet enemy and charges them then casts enrage. But the problem is casting enrage if I click the macro without a target in range
---
You belong in a museum.
---
Also considering using PTO, my only concern putting in for the time this early is if the release date gets pushed back due to technical issues or something.
---
Streamers arent saying only certain people can play 'our game'. Being a streamer doesnt make someone an asshole.
---
I lead every day. 
---
Game design is easy shit.
---
Or the gold being bought is coming from a hacked account.  Buying gold because you can’t be bothered to play the game is never okay.
---
14s housing system is pretty weird. Houses have a physical location and each server has a set amount. The plots are heavily contested and people spend ridiculous sums of gold trying to get the good ones. There’s an inactivity system wherein you lose rights to your property if you don’t login for X days to ensure that they aren’t gone forever.
---
I hear the music
---
Odd, but OK.
---
What? Any country with “proper laws” would give Blizzard an avenue to shut these thieves down.
---
Can't you just seeing far enough that drowning yourself takes you to the gnome/dwarf starting area?
---
I'm actually less busy as an adult because I don't have parents telling me to go to school.
---
Not only are jobs hard to find, they are literally pointless.
---
I am on social assistance and my landlord pays me to take care of the house for him too.
---
I hope you name your character BillWilson, I've decided to camp you for life.
---
maybe they'll fix it in the end if there is actually a fix but i'd take the waiting any day over this bulshit. 
---
OH WAIT! I HAD THAT and still played all the fucking expansions! i have no idea how that happened.
---
but yeah, let's thrash this game because some idiots cant wait 2 days to log in or 30 min for a 2 min item spawn.
---
The pets are just a bonus.
---
 Whelps drop mats for Fire Res Gear/Potions/Flasks as well they can be skinned and die very easily.
---
They also drop coin and the chance at BoE green/blue/epics.
---
&gt;1min cd snare removal is easily the best alliance racial.
---
Not saying you're wrong but one of my favorite moments from WoW was when an UD rogue jumped me, I was able to get the upper hand so he cloaked/sprinted//spit and a perception/intercept later I was doing the disco on his corpse.
---
So perception has a special place in my heart.
---
I think i'll make small stabs into it but not a dedicated push if that makes sense. If i'm in the area i'll do a bit.
---
Is there a limit to how many casts or commands you can have in a macro?
---
Unfortunately encapsulates why a ton of people watch it too.
---
But you didn't care because you never interacted with their guilds.
---
How many pets can you keep?
---
lmao this comment reminds me of all of the QQ posts we used to get on the original forums.
---
"ONLY A LOOSER GANKS PPL GET A LIFE"
---
I can't fucking wait to cause more of those.
---
I got this book recently and it's amazing.
---
I work in networking so his descriptions of the realms was fascinating to me. 
---
It's insanely just how many novel solutions they came up with for the networking issues, and how well they worked 
---
This book really made me respect blizzard
---
What medium is this? Doesn't really matter but, impressive as fuck no matter what
---
I hope you're right! That way I'm completely fine with it.
---
Oops sry.. I mean it had a 75% chance for each to hit count as two hits.. But not persistantly throughout the whole 6s...
---
Fun fact for you buddy, anyone good at any video game could play with a blob character and not care. Enjoy your day 😄
---
Because it destroyed world PvP and a huge aspect of the player interaction in a multiplayer game. But you weren't thinking about that because you just wanted to go fly off and look at a new speck of 14 year old terrain instead. 
---
Play retail.
---
This kind of content is what should be implemented past naxxramas tbh.
---
Although I wonder what kind of raids they could release.
---
Most of the team thought the same
---
They viewed it as a "dead end feature" which was 100% correct
---
EQs day/night cycle was really fast and DAoC's definitely wasn't one game day = one real day which is what he means. WoW did game time = real time which was a first, iirc. 
---
It was controversial, too, until we learned that night barely made any difference in WoW unlike previous MMOs.
---
It was a unique situation which is why i remember it. Someone else in the thread recalls it happening as well.
---
This is 100% not a faulty memory its how i learned that loot was rolled when the mobs spawned and not when they were killed.
---
Eh, I plan to do quick recipes on work days and play for a few hours with the bf after we eat. 1-3 hours a night, then we can be no life scrubs on our mutual day off. I also know what I'm doing this time around so I figure we'll ding 60 around early October which is just fine. I played Wildstar back when I had a commute that ate up all my free time and hit 50 after a handful of months while not knowing shit about that game, so I'm not worried. I want to enjoy the experience and have a few months to waste before the Honor system drops anyway.
---
I think people are returning for the community experience. The beta has already shown how the community is leagues better than retail and other MMOs at this time.
---
Yes the mechanics aren't ironed out but people are okay with that because what they really want is what the games brings to life on a server.
---
When TBC launched, I did the first few quests in Hellfire peninsula to get the axe/helmet/&amp; one or two others items for my hunter, I had 50-55 items greens before. Then I went back to winterspring &amp; started the grind.
---
Let just say that I got plenty of gold, enough to pay for the epic mount. I probably made something like 1k to 1.5k gold I think, got lot of greens &amp; blue, one epic item.
---
Remember that you don't get any xp from the quests, I finished the reputation at level 65.
---
6 months after the reputation got nerfed.... A second nerf happened 6 more months after..........
---
Anyway, its basically 60 -&gt; 65 killing only beasts &amp; furbolgs, I think I also got exalted to timbermaw hold btw doing this
---
Hmm... Azuremyst and Bloodmyst would have to be renamed. Those were names given by the Draenei.
---
It used to take something like 20 days if you did the quests regularly
---
post naxx patch?
---
Orc for rogue vs. rogue duels
---
if only...
---
It's a common private server bug. It shouldn't be working in classic.
---
People play fucking OSRS in droves, and you're worried about WoW's graphics?

\[1. General\]: LF INVITE TO JUMP TO LAYER #2!!

Yes, [exists] can be used to make sure that you have a target, or [harm] to make sure that you have an enemy target
---
For example will cast charge if you have an enemy target which is not dead.
---
    /cast [harm,nodead] Charge
---
It's like ventrillo or teamspeak but with additional text channels and a working phone app.
---
The text channels work as a kind of pseudo-forum. While you don't get as many options and as clean of a layout as you would with an actual website, having both voice and text chat in one application is convenient. It works well enough that you don't need to go through the hassle of setting up and managing a separate website.
---
Also there's the fact that setting up a discord server is completely free.
---
Good luck dude, the more podcasts the better
---
Because people want the best gear before phase 2?
---
Oh no I won't be able to join Alliance raids on my Horse character
---
I am a main healer as well and I personally wouldn't like this feature added
---
Kevin Jordan mentioned that some specs like enhance shaman were designed for things like tanking group quests and had anticipated people would be gearing and building for all sorts of content rather than just raids and pvp
---
Trust me, when you get out of uni you will be jealous of the free time you have now
---
Perception is fun but it's really only good against 1 class, and if you just want to beat rogues dwarf is still stronger. So yeah, no way it's ever 'best' for alliance.
---
I also would like to easily level mining in phase 1
---
Too much fun.  Remember to take everything in moderation, even World of Warcraft.
---
I love this book. So much. Its really eye opening just how much went into it. The people at blizzard at that time were so competent in all the ways that mattered, it's hard to explain but here's and example - they were willing to throw work out and start again, even stuff they worked on for months or years.
---
I've rarely worked with a team that is humble, and hard-working enough, to be willing to do that. In my field you frequently see people hacking garbage systems until they work instead of starting fresh because they're afraid of the work 
---
I really really respect that team
---
You can't just change something like this for one class and leave all other classes the same. This sort of change would HAVE to also result in massive changes to enhance sham/boomkin/ect. By the time you're done it'd be a completely different game, which is what everyone is hoping to avoid.
---
Alexstraza's model too
---
Well that sucks for you then.
---
I'll be doing a version of the 0/21/30 for the extra utility. 
---

Always loved that it was the main hub for alliance in vanilla. Remember first time walking in and thinking how much it would cost to get a house inside. :3
---
Hi, Don julio isn't bis in hunter stage 5, Exalted Agi signet ring of the Bronze dragonfight is. Anf if you equip 2 pugios, you can even use the ring of the God Slayer instead of accuria.
---
I don't get why they don't understand that we don't want the quality of life improvements that they think we need.  I don't care if there's a cue.  It was something we just dealt with back in the day.
---
When u see a druid who looks like an absolute clown but hes a viable aq40 tank
---
back to buffing healboi
---
There's absolutely no way that Blizzard will have layering throughout the entirety of Phase 1 anymore.
---
There's too many exploits and shit storms already because of it and it's only Beta. 
---
I don't care that they said they planned on having it until Phase 2, they change their mind all the time and this is already something so out of control that they have to do something.
---
I could see them just layering the starting zones 1-20 or limit the layering to the first two or three weeks.
---
Once people start abusing it to farm high sought after mobs/items the games economy is done before it even has a chance to start.
---
Housing FFXIV is a limited commodity but it's immensely popular for some as an endgame form of gameplay and many people sink loads of in-game currency and time into decorating their houses.
---
This was one of my favorite aspects of classic. That and the variety of pet abilities available based on the species.
---
Mine and skin until 60. Mail your mining mats to an alt. Vendor the leather. At 60 drop both and pick up engineering and herbalism. Use mats you saved to level engineering. 
---
Your biggest cost end game will be consumables. If you can provide the mats for your flasks and pots to a guildie it will be much cheaper overall.
---
You can also level fishing and cooking while leveling and make tons of gold (enough for mount at 40).
---
Then, once you're 60 and have herbalism. RFD is the best place for solo.
---
In BRD, the Mobs resist pickpocket a lot more often, and you can't kill the bosses without good gear.
---
This is so amazing. 15 years and I still get lost in some of the caves. Thanks for all your hard work!
---
I'd rather no one exploit it.
---
Bis has always been a thing
---
There is gonna be a huuuge hype in the beginning but many are gonna leave after they got their nostalgia fix.
---
If you are doing PvP only you’re going to want to go gnome. Escape artist for CC break, engineering bonus (engineering is a must in top tier PvP), and intellect bonus. Humans are fine for PvE but you do get considerable advantages in PvP by rolling gnome. If you hate them that much, go undead. Undead look cool af and horde usually focuses more on PvP (obviously it depends on servers but I think on average horde PvPs more)
---
*whispers under breath: Kharanos*
---
&gt;Classic is different. Your gear is your gear. There is no PvE and PvP gear.
---
False, there is PvE and PvP gear.
---
Friggin ridiculous that they didn't stick with the original plan of only having it in the starting zones(i.e. non-contested zones).
---
All of Azeroth for probably months feels like a disaster in the making to me.
---
Vendor the leather? It's not worth putting on AH?
---
Elder Scrolls Online doesn't have flying mounts and it's amazing how much it helps with making the world feel bigger. If you really think about it, the zones are kinda small, compared to WoW. But you don't see it when you're in game. Because the highest position you ever see them from is the saddle of your mount.
---
"Epics were Epics"
---
Many people's best in slot items for raiding were blues. Some of them like 10 levels below 60 and not replaced by any of the first raids.
---
Upper open area of lorderan an orb you click teleports you to the back room of silver moon
---
People on the beta aren't playing with 1000 ms ping.
---
There is video evidence of people kiting mobs without getting hit in close range.
---
On the beta, people with 20 ms latency get hit from range that they should not be.
---
Not until much higher levels. When a new server opens EVERYONE is LW for leveling so the cost on the AH plus the commissions ends up making less than vendoring. Also with precious little bagspace and considering the time it takes to go to AH etc you're much better off vendoring *most* of the skins.
---
interesting. I wonder what it is. I used SCT for most of vanilla.
---
I loved desolace
---
Most people started running instances   at 58 or so and could fill in leveling that way. I don't recall having to hard grind any levels, but in those days I think people ran more instances at all levels, despite the loot being worse.
---
I appreciate that you're bored waiting for classic and found a new type of karma to farm. But please don't get the idea that this is something that everyone wants and that you now have some type of responsibility to promote this idea to change the game. 
---
Part of being just another traveler in the world and not an almighty hero (the theme of this game) is that you won't necessarily have access to the entire world because it isn't feasible for you. This inadvertently makes the world feel bigger, more mysterious, almost more dangerous by not knowing everything that's out there. Call it lazy on the developers' part or whatever, but that's how I view it and am completely fine with there being sections of map that aren't completely accessible and fleshed out if it means the game stays the way that it was - the way we all grew to love it and grew up with it. 
---
Not saying your ideas are shit or that you shouldn't play around with stuff. But don't get the idea that this is something that everyone wants.
---
You dont seem to know much about Classic and I especially strongly disagree with 
---
&gt;Gamers love cosmetics. Game design is practically secondary to item cosmetic design nowadays. That is just the way it is.
---
Just got banned for saying O O G A in Asmongold's chat. What a bunch of babies.
---
So Blizzard didnt get any ideas from other games? Other game makers dont get ideas from other game makers? Im just introducing a resonable idea (thanos or watevr is not reasonable)  that would explain why Hunters are lacking in DPS compared to other games..
---
You talkin bout echeyakee dawg?
---
work computer would probably melt trying to run 2 chrome tabs

Blessing of Salvation &gt; Horde
---
Thousands and thousands of people play on pirate private servers, and have for over a decade. There's totally a market for an actual, official, stable, *authorized* legit Vanilla WoW experience.
---
It's a different game than modern MMOs, but a lot of people bemoan the departure from what it originally was. It's also free with a subscription to retail WoW (or retail WoW is free with a Classic subscription, depending on how you look at it), and they don't have to actually try to update it or produce any additional content or expansions for it since by design, that's not the idea at all. So it's not going to cost them as much to develop for since once it launches, development is effectively done. ;P
---
For what it's worth. You'd love playing a resto druid if you like pvp. They're clutch, and once mastered are the greatest healers and most fun to play for pvp environments
---
This looks like it’s on fire...
---
I thought mara came in a later patch.
---
I had a play around in 'Retro WoW', good for playing around with classes. Only has pre-raid BiS gear available for free. You've got to grind gold by doing daily quests to get raid gear, still might give you a good idea of what you want to play at 60. 
---
Also all raids are scaled on the server to be a 5 man instead of 40 so a lot more accessible.
---
If you are twelve you play for graphics.
---
If you are an adult you play for the experience.
---
Simple.
---
idk man, some of the ground textures look just so bad :D
---
LOL
---
Devilsaur mafia won't be a thing in classic. You can just find a buddy with skinning and farm no issues.
---
I died from fall damage trying it last night. I ended up having to foot run from Iron Forge all the way to Scarlet Monastery
---
Orc for Horde, Gnome for Alliance.
---
Isn't the plan now to have it for all of phase 1? That could potentially last for months...
---
Yeah that’s the one
---
Of course! It's my priest's signature ground mount. :)
---
Ouch. I'm glad mine is pretty decent.
---
"Roflmao" is the first video you're refering to.
---
In TBC I made a female gnomes named dancewitme at level one I died and ran to booty bay as a ghost. Jumped on the boat. Went to ratchet. Ran to org and resssed by the ghost closest to the city and it just gave me Rez sickness there. Then I leapfrogged my dead body as a ghost til I got on the perfect spot on the bank that didn’t Afro the guards and took off my clothes and /danced with my fellow hordies.
---
Gonna quit my job and move back on with my parents I think
---
Based on private servers you've got them mixed up. Savage Gladiator  Chain was in the game from the start, but had bad stats. +20 defense or something like that, gets updated in 1.10 to the good piece. Brigam Girdle and the Helm of the Executioner weren't put in until the loot revamp in 1.9 or 1.10.
---
Who doesn't
---
There are dozens of us. Yeah I feel that during closings where my day is spent working and sleeping for a week+.
---
Normalization just means the extra bonus damage on special abilities get normalized based on some set weapon speed. So before normalization, Arcanite Reaper would amplify the effect of attack power. After normalization you'd just worry about the total average damage per swing.
---
TMI
---
This is an add on ?
---
Such an easy fix, too. Hopefully they come to their senses...
---
Would definitely be pretty cool to see. I am a Wow classic fan but often miss a lot of these great community ideas. I love what the community is becoming again, back to the old days of wow.
---

did you type up that whole thing just to reply to yourself and go "nah"?
---
It's a website right now but who knows. Maybe we will be able to add similar functionality as an addon.
---
Warrior tanks can be big time investment if you are raiding, even as an offtank, there's quite a lot of work that goes in. Especailly with repair bills being what they are (painful)

they could still do that. releasing the draenei and belfs with their startingzones etc and do the other zones like hyjal etc

---
Well one increases your chance to even hit the target, the other reduces their chance to resist it IF it even hits... Hope this helps!
---
From my recollection, you really couldn't.
---
And I'd rather have 0 layering and server queues on day 1 - welcome to the club of blizzard not giving a fuck.
---
That's an odd color for Undercity.
---
(really pretty though great work)
---
I only wanted to play a Dark Iron and a Zandalari. I felt super betrayed to have to spend 6 weeks earning a character on the freaking box art.
---
Threat is a lot more punishing than it is now, and if you are raiding there's a decent amount of time investment when it comes to farming. But not too terrible.
---
Work 20 hors a day is illegsl. How can you be a lawyer and not know that? How can you have a higher education and do that to yourself without realising it has consequences on your health?
---
Another post about layering woohoo
---
Shedo is recommending it even in his discord now as the beta is out. Has it been tested? I have no idea because I stopped caring about feral about a month ago but I assume he knows.
---
Not a rare IIRC.  I think he spawns for a quest right?
---
What makes you think we hate them? 
---
Just because we don't like them doesn't mean we hate them. Things don't always have to be one extreme or the other.
---
I’m honestly prepared to lose it all for classic.  My gf will most likely leave when I start raiding.
---
Thanks for the free HKs then!
---
I probably could have tracked down more quests and got all the way to 60. I just... well I was shit. Classic is going to be my redemption arc. I still, with shame, recall when one of my party read me the riot act and left because I showed up to tank ST with no shield and arms specced. 
---
I just... needed those fucking feathers goddamn it.
---
&gt; we got so many other good rpgs by now maybe the standards have just changed.
---
Name 1 - that compares to what wow Classic offers... I'll wait.
---
What's chaining?
---
That Rogue sporting Bloodfang helm.  I can’t wait for OG Onyxia.
---
There's already plans to slowly remove layering after launch...
---
Yeah, that's my fear as well. 2-4 months of a fully layered Azeroth is a nightmare for us who want a pure vanilla experience.
---
Yeah that's bullshit there's no point in playing classic if I can't camp somebody who's 40 levels lower than me
---
It was never really an issue. From the 2006 wow wiki fishing page:
---
&gt; There are 4 separate intervals of fishing times. These intervals are 6am-12pm, 12pm-6pm, 6pm-12am, and 12am-6am. During this time the drop rates of certain fish varies, for example, Sunscale Salmon and Nightfin Snapper. According to experimentation, the cycle appears to be the following:
---
&gt; * 6am-12pm - Nightfin and Sunscale
---
&gt; * 12pm-6pm - Sunscale only
---
&gt; * 6pm-12am - Nightfin and Sunscale
---
&gt; * 12am-6am - Nightfin only
---
A much better solution (IMO) would be to allow facing same-faction opponents.
---
I'd say those cutscenes and mby a book on characters she finds interesting, I've only read War of the Ancients but it inspired me to know about NE lore + play the wc3 games
---
Just FYI bud not everyone likes all the same shit you do, and that doesn’t mean that they’re jealous.
---
They still get party switched mid fight to drop mana tide.
---
I’m playing a private server with the original client and the game looks fine.
---
Good players would win against bad players even if the bad players had double racial abilities and the good players have blank characters with no racials.
---
In this context I meant general things like, rewards like the Frostsaber, the cities are better, better quests etc.
---
Even if I was playing Alliance, there is no way I would do this. It was bad enough doing it at level 80 in Wrath after the grind had been nerfed!
---
Hit &gt; Resist
---
That's perfectly fine, but I just feel that going out of their way to ruin that enjoyment is unjustified. I don't like Marvel movies and a lot of people do, but I don't start spoiling things for people.
---
They are the same, just worded differently. 1 point of Suppression is effectively +2% spell hit.
---
I'm a Horde player but I have certainly played alliance toons and I feel the same way. I've never understood the draw to IF. Not to say IF sucks or anything like that, just that I've always felt SW is a much more interesting and aesthetically pleasing city. Plus the whole "canals make SW suck" argument has never made sense to me because the main area of IF *also* has a canal feature you have to take a bridge over to get from the bank to the AH which is just as much of a pain to fall into as the canals are in SW..
---
Just to add to this, when the spell hits, there is a dice roll to determine how much of the spell is resisted.
---
Yeah I forgot my sarcasm tag

---
Resistances are separate mechanic, they allow full or partial resist of damage (think fire resistances for MC runs or nature for AQ)
---
Spell hit reduces chance of "miss"
---
Yeah, but Rogues with Super Dragon Balls are a hard counter to Thanos' snap ability.
---
The pets level up, yes, no scaling after that
---
He's got a good point. There is going to be A LOT of PUG groups running Ony and MC because they are easy fights compared to what we are used to.
---
Time has impacted us all. The way we play, the goals we set, the information we use etc.
---
There's nothing aside from some Fire Resistance that would break an MC PUG these days, players are used to harder fights in dungeons while leveling now.
---
Yeah. The seriously need to address this before launch or else I'm waiting.
---
A marathon is a race too
---
I don't know what to believe!
---
Go back to retail farming island expeditions, grinding the same dungeons every patch for the exact same gear but with a higher ilvl hoping for titanforging, doing warfronts that you have to try really hard to even lose.
---
Go outside in the world do the amazing world quests with all the people around you, I mean NPCs because you can't see anyone due to phasing.
---
Do it. Make his life hell. Make every one of his stream whores try to hunt you.
---
Oh, I see why hunters suck. It's definitely not because 
---
* Pets do the same damage for a fresh 60 and someone in full T3 (minus the 50 AP from set bonus)
---
* You're using the same ammo from start to finish
---
* You get practically no upgrades in AQ and a handful in Naxx while other classes get massive upgrades in both of those tiers. Enjoy using BWL weapons and gear until Naxx.
---
Nah, it can't be any of those issues, it's because hunters don't have a broken ability from a different game!
---
You are doing the work of the gods sir.
---
You guys are deluded.  Laying is necessary to reduce the devastating impact of the inevitable mass exodus shortly after launch.  Like 95% of the people that make an account won't get past like 30.  They'll go inactive.
---
Great work man!
---
It is not illegal lol
---
They never said that...
---
How does this work for non-binary resists?
---
So a miss appears as a "resist" even though it's not a resist?
---
Perception for pesky rogues/Druid's.
---
Spirit 
---
Reputation advantage
---
I would imagine it would all be one server, just layered base on level.
---
He forgot to switch accounts.
---
The paladin mount quest isn't all that time consuming. Especially compared to this.
---
There's none
---
They should add more layering. Eventually the layers will devour each other, then one will remain.
---
Spells do not have "miss" messages in vanilla
---
Honestly. Pick a race that you're going to e not looking at for several DAYS worth of hours.
---
Probably because you condescendingly tried to make someone feel stupid even though they clearly know more than you do about the matter.
---
I forgot about Richard!
---
I waiting for Skywind to come out, which is Morrowind with the Skyrim engine.. So I think certain older games can still be popular, among people who never played them.. As long as the graphics look up to date.
---
War Stomp -&gt; cast
---
Can someone please ELI5 what layering and sharding is? Are streamers coining these terms or something? I’m uncool.
---
it does, but you can run as a ghost to a different GY and use the spirit there.
---
&gt;There's nothing to talk about. There's no transmog in Classic.
---
You forgot to switch accounts dipshit
---
&gt;&gt;don't stream lol
---
&gt;Yeah... That's like saying '' just don't go to work lol''
---
They chose a job that annoys people. 
---
If I chose to stand in the middle of a crowded area and screamed at people would it be wrong for the people I'm screaming at to be upset and do something to try and stop me?
---
Nah, I don't like the night elf's racial abilities. I'll roll something else.
---
like I said... so many bugs, and this is just the hunter class alone
---
 Classic will launch riddled with bugs sadly.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bwlfdu/the_definitive_hunter_bug_compilation_sheet/?sort=new

it was really low like 40 or something per area, and i didnt discover much because i had to stick to the roads to avoid getting 1 shotted by mobs (which still happened anyways).

---
Slowly, gently, this is how a life is taken.
---
Yeah, it's been that way since WoD.
---
Or just fucking disable layering for any zone over level 30? It's baffeling to me that's it's turned on for all of Azeroth.
---
Yep, you essentially end up microsleeping. You sleep for 30 min or less at a time without even realizing you've done it. Feels like you blinked.
---
Everquest 1999 private server has like 3000+ people playing daily.
---
The Worgen in duskwood had extremely fast respawn behavior in vanilla. I specifically remember grinding them because they were packed tight together and respawn very quickly.
---
I'm mostly interested in PvP. I have a group of friends that I'll be with pretty much at all times for world PvP and BG. My friends are playing Paladin, Priest, and Warrior.
---
Which class do you guys think I would have the most fun with and benefit the most with considering I'll always have a pocket healer or two?
---
So far I've been playing Warlock and Rogue, but I'm open to playing any class. They all seem so fun so I'm just looking for pretty much any kind of feedback. What do you think would be most devastating PvP wise with this group?
---
Is there an alliance version of op's wallpaper?
---
I have not kept up with all the bugs or every classes bug list, but the hunter alone has a pretty large list of bugs.
---
I would be shocked if Classic launches with even half these fixed, let alone the melee leeway bugged fixed.
---
According to cadet once you have all the best gear and buffs and everything survival is the best spec lol
---
Limit layering to first 2 zones (e.g. elwynn and westfall) and just remove it after a while, otherwise it will be abused for mid and higher level stuff.
---
Im not so much into mmorpgs, but after playing games like f.e. witcher, its hard to imagine going back to grinding crappy looking mobs for some random quest in northern barrens
---
moar dots
---
nerdiness splurge but if this was vanilla design philosophy, there would really only be a Ardent dawn village that is accessible to both horde/alliance. and the entire area would be way more messed up by scourge with potential combination of demon areas due to the lore of demon influence of scarlet crusade and the actual influence for their hate for undead grew so much blah blah.
---
the clean split of a horde and alliance village in each zone is too much TBC and beyond mentality
---
how so? if anything it feels worse than it ever has imo, probably compounded by the gcd changes for bfa now that i'm thinking about it.
---
Wait so we should ignore the good thing, because eventually it becomes bad? I mean may as well commit suicide because that's literally everything in life. (I'm not advocating for suicide I'm showing how stupid that argument is)
---
There can only be one.
---
I'm not.
---
I'm seriously starting to think the CANT disable layering at this point, and all that talk about disabling it for phase 2 is just PR bullshit. They'll come up with some excuse to still have it in when the time comes.
---
I feel like people are exaggerating too much. You have to understand that this whole layering thing isn't in its final state yet and is clearly bugged on beta atm. I think it's fine that people bring more attention to it regarding how it can be abused but I'd be surprised if this is something Blizzard aren't already aware of.
---
I sorta thought so, but it's getting hard to tell especially with cunts like the CIA guy
---
If a server with 2 layers has 2x the population of a normal server, then how is it an exploit that there are 2x the resources?
---
The greatest city in Warcraft is Suramar.
---
I never got bored of it personally. 
---
I just feel like they thought it was a design flaw that the games could drag on for 2 days at a time.
---
Correct you blow a horn and she spawns.
---
Hmm I still prefer no layering at all except low levels at launch. I mean what’s the benefit of it?
---
3.  1 Active 2 stable.
---
Yes they did. Their initial plan is to have Layering until the end of Phase 1 when Phase 2 begins.
---
There are things mysterious about hard to get to high level zones...there is nothing mysterious about areas that simply dont exist...
---
Your reason for not wanting this content is exactly a selling point for it. Post Naxx content and world zones would exclusive just based on the gear and possible attunement or keying requirements to even enter the zone--who's to say an item isnt added to 4h that has to drop to allow people access to this apparently Scarlet Crusade dominated zone.
---
&gt; A 6 second disarm could be the difference between surviving a double pull or not
---
Unless you miss it...
---
I imagine it is not about Vanilla PvE, but the challenge of pushing something to the absolute limit of possible.
---
Ahhh ok thanks for the clarification..
---
Correct.
---
A miss is the same as a 100% resist
---
Perfection
---
I see people wanting to change a game that was brought back for people who wanted the original game as it was. 
---
I say you should direct your efforts towards fixing retail.
---
These are awesome! Love it, thanks for sharing.

Once I'm done with "The Insane"...
---
They are two completely different things, if you don't have hit chance on your gear YOU will miss your target, if your target has a lot of resistance toward that school of spell and your spell lands THEY can resist the spell.
---
Try speccing into entrapment, deterrence, and the other survival talents and keep using tidal charm/grenades and you'll see that one is quite more useful than the other =P
---
Garrisons are pretty close for me. It's an instanced location so I cant get ganked for sure unlike Orgrimmar, there's no lag like in Dalaran and it has plenty of vendors, an auction house and a bank. The customisation is minimal, but it's the closest thing to player housing you get in the game.
---
Yeah, from reading these other posts there’s apparently a rare black one that spawns out there as well and isn’t part of a quest, however I’ve never seen that one
---
Not on my home PC right now but my wallpaper is the logic screen without the UI.
---
I was testing to see how long it would take to get from making a chat to get to gurubashi arena. After a few routes I realized I could just go die and spirit Rez... And save about 1:30 of pure run time.
---
Hell yeah, winterspring mount, paladin and warlock level 60 mounts, black battle tank(I know I won't get it but still going to try), rhok'delar and benediction are my goals over the next few years.
---
In a raid environment why is it not going to happen lol you can easily have 1 Hunter specd to give trueshot and marks to give the rest of the hunters more dps
---
That instance was made in Legion, I believe.
---
I would love to see The Master's Cellars expanded into a 5 man, The Crypt into a 20, and Karazhan rebuilt entirely into a 40 man. As much as I really loved BC Kara, as long as we're fantasizing Clasic +, lets go all the way.
---
lul
---
Not everyone in alliance is gonna be in front of stormwind at launch though what are you saying lmao. The population is going to be split from the get-go because of each race's different starting zones. The purpose of the stress test was to get everyone in the same place. Some people are also gonna quest in different spots after the initial starting zone which is gonna divide the population even more.
---
It's really hard to say which is best for Alliance.
---
Humans get stealth detection, which is good for beating other Rouges and Druid's.
---
Gnome with escape artist, this is great but we have other abilities and talents which can remove snares. So is it really the best?
---
Dwarf have Stoneform to remove bleed, posion, and disease. This is good if you get opened up on with a garrote/rupture and want to restealth, or rend by a warrior..
---
I was dead set in Humans because I much prefer the human look over Dwarf and Gnome. But the more I think about it the less sure I get on this decision. I think Stoneform and escape artist are better option, but out of them two I can't decide.
---
Disable it on pvp servers
---
You might never see the gloves drop though
---
I understand that, what I don't understand is doing that for vanilla pve lol. Literally anything else fuck it 120 people dedicated to making all redridge NPC's permadeath even sounds better in comparison.
---
Definitely travel form
---
Read Arthas: Rise of the Lich King and Lord of the Clans by Christie Golden. Some of the best fantasy novels I've ever read and they perfectly set up vanilla WoW.
---
When I was young I played with boxes and I liked it
---
as long as people get mad ill keep doing it ahaha
---
There not the same.... a missed spell will deal zero damage, but a resisted spell will still deal damage just reduced based on the targets resistance (note can still deal zero damage).
---
You get my upvote for that shit bahaha
---
I’ve always rolled horde, rarely played on alliance, but I’m fond of the dwarves. I love their starting zone, racial mounts and city.
---
The only raid content in p2 that isn't in p1 would be azuregos &amp; kazzak, and their drops were pretty lackluster.  Maybe they're not on any BiS lists, making a p1 BiS identical to a p2 BiS.  Going to go through it and test that hypothesis
---
Absolutely amazing! Gonna use this as my new wallpaper
---
In general, it's case by case. As for your specific examples:
---
* Suppression - Works exactly the same as spell hit. 1 point = 2% hit (Affliction spells only; doesn't affect Shadow Bolt)
---
* Unyielding Faith - I'm not 100% sure if the resistance from this talent can be overcome by spell hit. My gut says no and that it works the same as Orc stun resist. But again, not 100% sure on that.
---
I literally don't know what else you think I am either going to do or am capable or doing to promote this idea
---
It is, sure the graphics is outdated it was made 15 years ago, but it should matter since it's the best game ever made.
---
There are very few real MMORPGs out there and out of those few classic wow probably has the best graphics.
---
Just gotta learn to manage your time well. I work 50+ hours a week and still manage 40 or so hours of gaming a week.
---
here, i will give you the greatest tool college ever tought me:
---
google.com
---
You are correct, the "missed" he means would just mean the spell deals zero damage.
---
Umm..re-read the post. OP was agreeing with you, ya doofus.
---
I definitely agree, and I also think that offering conditional workarounds for these things (didn't AQ have an item that teleported you to Silithus) like mages, warlock summons, etc. pushes you to establish a social connection (temporary like in a trade chat or more permanent like guilds) and creates symbiotic relationships between members of the community
---
When everyone can teleport everywhere or fly around on 400% mounts it's taking that away a little bit
---
Layering needs to be removed 100% at all levels. Make dynamic respawns like private servers if you have to, for Gods sake change the mob spawns instead of limiting player interaction. 
---
Layering will affect everything herbs mines ect.
---
Keep in mind you will need to grind 2 things to get this mount as a gnome.  
---
1. You need to grind exalted with the night elf faction so you can learn to ride tigers.  
---
2. You need to grind the rep with Winterspring.  
---
It's pure vanity, but it's one of the few vanity items that isn't tied to a ridiculous drop rate where RNG plays a huge factor, and of all the mounts that you can realistically get on alliance - this is the best one (other than maybe the Scholo undead horse, but again that's a less than 1% drop rate)
---
Breathtaking. Did an outstanding job here. I am smelling the flickering braziers.
---
Im in the exact same situation.  
---
The thing that might make me go gnome is the additional engi skill and the fact that they are tiny and are generally harder to spot.  
---
The reputation racial of the humans are a really nice one but I really dont know.   
---
Either way I will lvl in elvynn.  
---
If the Gnomes racial wouldnt have the cast time I would 100% choose gnome...
---
Dude, I am sorry but no amount of money is worth working that much, let alone what you are getting paid. I worked big 4 accounting for a long time, working those same terrible hours. Take control of your life, and find a job that treats you less like meat and more like a human.
---
You are wrong.
---
https://classic-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Spell_Hit_Chance
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Suppression
---
You can check any reputable wiki.
---
&gt;So, this makes sense with what I said. They have an option to mitigate the negative effects, in this case stream delay, but they choose not to because it makes them more money when they don't have a delay
---
Well that's kind of like saying a person who has a 2 hour commute to work should give up their car to be more environmentally conscious. Should it happen in an ideal scenario? Yes. But it's just not realistic unless there are very good global alternatives put in place.
---
And that sort of event happens like once at most. Is that really enough to anger you so much so that you want to corpsecamp the streamer?
---
&gt; My fiancé
---
Weird flex, but okay.
---
There should be an MC/Ony list without DM/dragon gear.
---
The witcher is an amazing game yes, but it has nothing to do with WoW.
---
There are tons of good single player RPGs out there, but there isn't any good MMORPGs at all. Some decent maybe, but nothing on the level of Vanilla.
---
No, they didn't and that's not their plan.
---
I’m not worried about it.  Not planning on hanging around longer than 3 years, and not doing the whole Golden Handcuffs routine.  Life is like that.  You eat shit to build a foundation.  It doesn’t bother me.
---
Asmonmold
---
Is 14 int and 10 spirit even worse than 6 frost sp? Might be, I'm not sure though.
---
What. It has nothing to do with the client. it's how the server places your character server side.
---
The fact that you're rapid-fire churning them out with titles like "what you've all been waiting for" implies that you think that this is something "you all" want to see in the game and it's not.
---
I'm so happy people are finally starting to realize layering and phasing are the same god damned thing. A month or so ago everyone was fine with it when they first saw it because "hey at least it's not phasing." No. It's the exact same thing and if not handled properly we'll just have a Classic game with a lot of issues from retail.
---
I got like 5 request for northeron, and then I made it for them, so sorry for thinking people wanted me to make it
---
Don't think so. Already obtained it in the past and even though I loved Classic, I didn't really like grinding that mount. This time around I'm also just planning to just focus mainly on PvP and a bit of raiding, so no side-content. But that's also because I don't have as much time anymore nowadays like I did in the days of Vanilla when I was younger :)
---
The great part about this mount is that anyone can realistically hope to achieve it as it has nothing to do with anyone else (aside from world PvP).
---
Scarab Lord and rank 14 are highly dependent on social status among whatever raiding guild you're in - and rank 14 depends on how much you are playing compared to other players.  
---
If somebody wanted to grind an hour a day, they could get this.
---
Rick and morty fan spotted
---
Go on...
---
Gnome is good for being tiny when you gank people and having a sick kick animation.  😎
---
In countries with proper laws individuals would not be allowed to profit off of stolen ip
---
Where did I say anything about people gathering in front of stormwind? I played the stress test there was easily 100 people in the orc starting area. Obviously people are going to spread out but you will still be competing for quest mob tags.
---
its about even.
---
Not needing Blizzard to manually merge realms later
---
Or they wont fix it and lose gobs of people to free private servers without sharding/layering. Doesnt matter either way honestly no matter what they do they're going to fuck it up somehow.
---
Did this with some friends not too long ago on live wow. Just server hopped between 3 different servers and got all of the chests. Got the 13 we all needed SUPER fast was nice.  
---
Phasing/layering what ever this called should not be in classic at any point. Just ruins the game and provides nothing of value. I'd rather lag with 250 ping and wait for a 2000 person queue than play with this. 
---
Imo this is one of the most important things they need to keep out of classic.
---
You spread your MM hunters in melee groups so they buff the melees. You don't stack your hunters in the same group.
---
You’ll need to have good knowledge of dungeon/raid layouts and mechanics. You’ll be the de facto group leader. Luckily there’s YouTube these days.
---
I understand that people don’t want 1.13 content but holy shit I’m so in after seeing what these zones could be. 
---
There is so much that could be added to the game keeping the Vanilla style gameplay in mind. That’s why, in my opinion, it would be a shame to just redo straight TBC. And I loved TBC but I think Outlands and flying mounts really ruined If there was a feasible way to do both, I’d be totally in for that but it’s not going to happen. I just think they have a real opportunity to do something new and fresh after we finish the regular raid tiers. 
---
But I’ll be pretty happy regardless of what they decide to do.
---
I was going to respond with this but I guess you beat me to it.
---
You'll definitely want an epic mount and at least pre-raiding BiS gear before you start this grind.  
---
If you think about it, you'll grind for an epic mount as soon as you get this mount if you don't already have it - but if you grind after you'll lose out on the efficiency of having the epic mount during the grind.
---
I believe you're mistaken twice.  I legitimately don't care if he uses the item theres no condescension maybe it'll work for him he can use it if he wants to.  I won't be needing it.
---
release is in 2 months... id be really surprised if they managed to significantly improve the phasing technology by then if its still this shitty.
---
I’m actually having a big dilemma with this question, I actually didn’t play in Vanilla, I started in TBC and played right up until late Legion, my life has changed a lot in the year and a half that I’ve not been playing WoW, I’m definitely healthier, I see more of my family and friends and my family especially as happy that I don’t play WiW any more, and I have a GF who I adore, but while I’m healthier I don’t know if I’m actually happier, but honestly I haven’t even thought about playing again and even sold my computer.. But now... I saw some random add about a week ago about Classic’s release and I’ve been watching so many videos about it recently and I can say that this is something I really want to do, I want to experience that brand new expansion feeling again, but with the O.G. game, I want to feel that exciting aspect of exploring and finding new things and community, the things that even as someone who didn’t play vanilla I’ve seen deteriorate over the years on live.
---
So that’s my current problem, do I accept my life as it is now and just try to forget about this pretty much once in a lifetime opportunity to have that feeling again, or do I say screw it all, but myself another computer and go back to being the huge closet geek that I have been for all of my life?
---
I miss this type of sad, low quality smack talk. Reminiscent of the old WoW forums.
---
Nope. Found at least one instance of azuregos/kazzak loot (snowblind shoes) No idea why there's no BiS list for p1.
---
This mount got so much attention back in classic. It stood out, drastically, especially with how few people completed the grind.
---
I thought layering was only supposed to happen in the first one or two leveling zones, as per Ion himself - am i missing something?
---
I still talk to two of the people I grinded the mount with, one on a regular basis, 14 some years later.
---
Talk about reward.
---
Ah okay. That's kind of lame for getting a collection.
---
Lol this is my thought every time someone brings this up. People are just incapable of understanding that there are negative consequences associated with the best decision.... I want my cake and I am going to eat it too! Lol
---
For how old wow is the art holds up very very well
---
Fixing retail isnt about getting people who are explicitly excited for Classic, Classic+, CTBC, or CTBC+ back into Retail--Blizzard has other mechanisms to get their subscriptions (chiefly Classic, currently, and possibly other offshoots later). 
---
Fixing retail would be about getting people who want to play the game as it has been since MOP interested in the game again. 
---
Fixing retail means making retail attractive to people who left during MoP/WoD/BfA. Not turning retail into something those excited for classic would want to play.
---
They are on different tracks. Classic can either be a 2-3 year run with no plan to retain the people who come to play through it this time through, or they can have new content planned to entice those who want old school wow but arent the type who would play the same 2+ years of content over and over and over again like the die hard pserver crowd has. Or Blizzard can develop content for the classic crowd.
---
Ultimately, I'm torn. At the very least I think we will see a seasonal restart to a legit WoW Classic server every 2+ years for as long as blizzard is a company. Beyond that Blizzard has options, rerelease BC and Wrath...or "retouch" and "remaster" classic. 
---
It could be no nonsense additions like guild banks or auto standing when casting from a seated position or auto dismounting when casting a spell. Or it could be bigger things like dropping the 16 debuff limit and retuning boss health, or rebalancing the classes. We could see additional zones and post naxx 5 mans and raids.
---
All sorts of things could happen.   
---
Games as a service dont care what youre doing for that $15 a month, so long as you're paying it. Blizzard should know by now that moving live towards the design philosophy of classic will force more current players away than those changes will bring back. For better or worse, I think blizzard is looking at development for two communities as their best path towards maximizing subs.
---
**It works like this (overview):**
---
**Spell is casted &gt;** check to see if spell affects the target or not (based on target level, and base chance to spell "miss", targets talents, buffs and equipment) then:
---
* **if a hit:** then spell damage is reduced by targets resistances/buffs/talents/gear then what's left goes to hp.
---
* **if a miss:** then the spell effect/damage Is 100% resisted.
---
I finished this grind literally a week before they nerfed it. I put in my time and tears, never again.
---
I’ve been leveling a Sham on PS and I’ve been getting mostly +str, agility items from quests. I’m collecting +int gear from healing dungeons. Wailing Caverns is amazing for Shaman loot. Def run that a few times.
---
This shit is common in any game with layered or instanced or whatever term you want to use. It happened inin many games before and i cant believe its taken them this long to figure it out.
---
More like 1200 hours.
---
Your reference is closer to the famous quote "They Don't Think It Be Like It Is But It Do" than the one u said it's based off of
---
In your opinion
---
Closet geek for life
---
**Your Title:**  
---
I figured out why Hunter's DPS Sucks.  
---
**Your Body:**    
---
Because they don't have this skill from another game.  
---
It's honestly the worst thing I've read on this sub, if you can't see how that makes no sense in the context of WoW nobody is going to be able to help you.
---
FFS, I knew this sharding bullshit would ruin the experience the first time they mentioned it. And now it's in every zone for probably months. GG, Blizzard!
---
Hope blizz will see this, nice work man
---
That sounds like it could be a good alternative; especially if it is coupled with the game cutscenes, I think.
---
Sharding is little bubbles of space shared between many realms to make the world feel fuller. Layering is the whole continent done same way within one overpopulated realm. Both are abusable by asking for invites to groups in a different shard or layer than you to get something not in your version of the world but available in the other. Makes abusing resources, rares and pvp really easy.
---
anybody caught with WCB on alliance would be on grounds for a ban. But in reality it would be easier to just make them faction specific buffs
---
I did that in vanilla. It's mind numbingly boring.  And if anyone is there it takes 60% longer.
---
I'm shit at hunter.
---
This is so visually pleasing! Great work. The text alignment of descriptions could be better but please, take it only as a constructive criticism.
---
You go between that vendor, and a small monster town to kill some guys for a drop.  1000+ times.
---
Good Lord I never knew it was so brutal.  Now I won't feel jealous of anyone who has it, just a bit sad.
---
People do not need to be open to new content in vanilla. 
---
People asked for vanilla and were under the impression that vanilla would be delivered as vanilla. 
---
Always wanting new shit for the sake of it being new is what led us to retail. 
---
If you want something new but in "the vanilla spirit," support other MMO developers in making a new game in said spirit. But do not ask Blizzard for stuff like this.
---
Am i the only one that will never use this Atlas?  Seems very weak
---
Dude everyone with a life is going to be behind.. if you are "ahead" you should probably question your life; if under the age of 18....

Underrated comment

From what I’ve seen PS recently warriors are as in demand as they ever where def no need to worry there.
---
I don't know how else to refer to her accurately; she's not my girlfriend anymore, but also not yet my wife. I guess I could've said partner?
---
Not a daily.  Unlimited number of times.

Stoneform is why I will be playing a dwarf rogue.
---
Thanks! I'll add them to her Goodreads account!
---
Thank you for all of your sleepless nights dedicated to the work you've done for us &lt;3

Some of the best graphically looking MMOs have the worst gameplay. Ground textures... Wow man....

Northern Lordaeron: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c09szr/what_youve_all_been_waiting_for_how_northern/
---
How long does that grind take?
---
I remember grinding to exalted with the Timbermaw while leveling. That was a long one. Likewise, those damn obsidian warbeads off the ogres in Nagrand for that Talbuk. Where those grinds comparable?
---
I've heard good things about War of the Ancients, I'll check it out.
---
BOF isn't really an argument when you can just bring loads of free action pots which most everybody does in vanilla PvP now.
---
Any plans to highlight the selectable caves/indoor areas on the map? For example, Drywhisker Gorge to the East of Hammerfall in Arathi Highlands is a little difficult to find unless you know about it.  Otherwise it looks great!
---
please do, I would really enjoy such a thing
---
The defenition of Daily is "Everyday", people who went for this grind would do the necessary quests daily
---
Thinking about a shaman, going Ele and strictly PVP. What race should I be?
---
Is getting exalted with Cenariorn Cirle worth it. I have heard it's long and hard?
---
Work on it and get better!
---
Hell, I'm even okay with it being in all the non-contested zones at this point. I seriously can't wrap my head around why they decided to implement it all over Azeroth. Can they even run the servers without sharding at all? I'm starting to doubt that more and more...
---
Humans want all other races, even their allies, extinguished. They’re the Nazis.
---
Night Elves are responsible for the planet nearly destroying itself time and time again. They’re the Russians.
---
Dwarves fight amongst themselves and dig shit up they shouldn’t. They’re the Middle Eastern regimes.
---
Gnomes are just refugees and can't ever fend for themselves. They’re the Middle Eastern peasants.
---
Orcs just don’t want to be slaves, to demons or anyone else. They’re the African Americans.
---
Trolls just want a home. They’re the Israelis.
---
Tauren just want people to love the planet. They’re the Canadians.
---
Undead just want freedom and revenge against the Lich King. They’re the White Americans.
---
Enough said.
---
Does he now
---
You think it's recent success is mainly driven by nostalgia and not because it is a good game?
---
I feel sorry for you
---
Fucking ASSHOLES send everyone this same fucking email KNOWINg that people’s lives are meaningless and empty without the beta access
---
&gt;low droprate items in dungeon/raid are ignored...
---
&gt;rand drop greens are ignored...
---
So this isn't a BiS list but actually an **Almost** BiS list.
---
Holy shit that's cool
---
We'll see, I have a few months to figure out my schedule before the game comes out.
---
Really odd timing in my life, I graduated college in December and was still staying part time at my current job so I had time to go to interviews and what not. If Classic had come out in January I would have been able to go HARD.
---
Undead's fear break is pretty good because I attack just about every priest and lock that I see out in the world.
---
BFA version is more badass. But classic resembles more of a banshee.
---
Alliance has better zones and better cities. Alliance races also look better. The best part though is the faction isn’t entirely 40yr old 300lb neckbeards and edgy teens playing undead rogue
---
Alliance will be over populated. Horde is the underdog realm and will need all the help it can get. Everyone picks Alliance because they want "pretty" races, also they get to insta-win BGs like Alterac Valley because of massive imbalance issues that never got fixed. Pick Alliance if you want wins given to you. Pick Horde if you want to earn wins.
---
+1
---
Much longer. Many hundreds of hours, probably closer to a thousand when dealing with gankers, pvp, fighting over slow respawns, and the fact that I was a holy specced priest.
---
Not sure about the discription of the third one but alot of it sounds like familiar parts from Rise of the living dead 3: The turning
---
If that's the same kala that played heroes of the storm, that dude is absolutely awesome. Watch and listen to everything he says if you play his class.

most of the time for a Holy Priest
---
You can buy 4 of each 6, 8, and 10 slot bags for about 10 gold from bag vendors. Skinning will make you more than 10 gold by level 40. While you may not "need" skinning as much, it gives you more disposable income for bags. Running back to the vendors a couple extra times early in your leveling isn't a big deal because it gives you the gold for bigger bags.
---
/r/gatekeeping
---
Hell no... But I will be starting my Human's journey by running all the way to Teldrassil to build up my Night Elf rep for the Swift Mistsaber.
---
Infernal mechanic was such a good troll. Great boss though, nothing too flashy but great atmosphere and feel
---
Lagforge was one reason I usually went to level in Kalimdor not matter which Alliance race I played.
---
Dartol's Rod was the main reason, though.
---
I mean, people can and do corpsecamp for no reason. They're putting a huge target on their backs by rolling on a PVP server, on top of that.
---
Also, mfw you compare streamers that make oodles of cash with someone trying to make ends meet 😂
---
No. You will never push content while it's difficult in a DPS role. That's Shaman (and Paladin) life until TBC.
---
If you actually want to be Enhancement in raids: Spec 30 points Enhancement, 21 points Resto for Nature's Swiftness. Accept that healing is your default role, but let people know that you are in fact Enhancement. Swing your 2H weapon on trash pulls / 5 mans / whenever you're messing around. Eventually, after the raid gets more gear, you won't need as many healers as they did in the first few weeks. They will be more open to your off-spec.
---
The only quote I've seen is something like "a few weeks into phase 1." Show me where you saw all of phase 1.
---
Who said it wasn't?
---
Been there, done that. Got the cat.
---
Mara was in patch 1.2 which will be part of Classic Phase 1.
---
That may be how you feel, but you're objectively wrong.
---
&gt;Behavior that intentionally detracts from others' enjoyment (such as griefing, throwing, feeding, etc.) is unacceptable. We expect our players to treat each other with respect and promote an enjoyable environment. Acceptable behavior is determined by player reports and Blizzard's decision, and violating these guidelines will result in account and gameplay restrictions.
---
https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/42673
---
&gt; kinda like how paladins dont ever equip their sets because they aren’t set up for healing.
---
Fuck, I had forgotten about Healbot Paladins wearing dresses...
---
Upvoted because trying to help community. But Jesus Christ, that question is specific af.
---
I sadly never got a key during my play time. I will be testing during the AV stress test or at least trying to get a key to test it.
---
I could see that. Did free realm transfers not help this? 
---
Also aren’t they doing cross realm bgs? Wasn’t that usually the biggest complaint. Although I could still see it being a big issue out in the world or pve content if you have low pop
---
I imagine this to be the case, that a large majority of retail players will at least try it out, maybe ding 9 or 10, and than realize the game isn't for them.  Or maybe a ton will find out they really enjoy it.  
---
Either way, I'm excited to see how things pan out.
---
The good thing about leveling a Priest is that you can heal in dungeons leveling up without investing in holy. Personally I don’t like shadow much so I stay hybrid even if it’s not optimal. I like getting my heals down to 2.5 secs cast etc, really helps when you get to Sunken Temple etc.
---
Didn't say it was a daily, but the people doing the quests will be doing them daily

Notice the caves on the west and east. Winterax hold on the west, and a gnoll encampment+npc's for the quest i linked above on the east. Both of these areas aren't even in 1.12 AV you cannot find them. All quests related to them got removed and those are just the obvious things missing.

Korrak and the elite trolls all gone, quests related to earning the weapons tied to them were nerfed HARD

I like to think this could happen in canon, that Classic is actually some kind of alternate timeline.

Any lore buffs want to speculate on where and how, precisely, we could diverge?

We need to stop the events of TBC (and presumably also the Cataclysm) without going far back enough that we upset Classic-era geopolitics with the butterfly effect.
---
Pewdiepie isn't gonna sleep with you for defending his honor. Pvp is fun. The bigger the target you piss off the better. Quit forming imaginary emotional bonds with streamers like they're your family or something.
---
You sure can buddy
---
This is quite literally the most stupid thing i´ve ever read on reddit. Like there is not even enough sense to it to argue against it.
---
Only thing that makes this question dumb is that it gets asked 4-5 times a day. 
---
The answer is yes, you can.
---
I am a horde, and I agree, this is the greatest city. Such a cool zone. I used to sneak in here all the time and /wave at people from my hiding spots.
---
Classic is a great game and I personally enjoy it without having any nostalgia for it. However many people wont share that feel after their initial nostalgia or curiousity what all the hype is about is gone. Its a fifteen year old game after all, do you really think Classic is for everyone?
---
Soul Link warlocks were complete garbage in vanilla group pvp though. It wasn't until TBC they became useful at anything except 1v1.
---
In reality, it forces you to wear more threat gear to make up for your lack of weap skill/ berserking.  Its a negative tradeoff for the majority of the game. 5% hp is just not as good as the others.
---
You do the same quest on repeat over 800 times in a row.
---
I need this tattooed on my back
---
They didn't really. The free realm transfers only went from the massive servers to the dead servers, leaving my low/med server to wallow in despair.
---
I personally don't mind server merges *if* we assume Blizzard is actually on point about it. But you'd then have the spam of complaints about "server identity" or some bullshit.
---
Layering is essentially an automated way to merge a bunch of servers together later without completely separating the economy and whatnot.
---
ooooh so thats why
---
Blood effects only occur when the target has a bleed. Warriors have a talent that causes bleed on crits which makes it very common to see.
---
The people posting shit like this are the same ones that complain the sub is toxic. Kindly fuck off.
---
Before it was patched, having Broken Tooth as a pet while jumping around the IF Auction House with Rhok'Delar made me feel like the best god-damn Hunter of all-fucking-time. 
---
Oh man, the nostalgia...

[Something like this maybe](https://www.classicwowtools.live/character/d12eca6f80be4965f706a27dd61860e02ad004e0879979e7d321bbe79460b56c95f1adedf1a564f68afe80316d296041587ef643e61c77a4c379b7bbe6c2fd119522416485814b0e627f924d7601673bebf52c99f91f5e947e9620a1821c760b9c5f19c10c5641e349fa61d5d638d1209ce78158b17188fb0d0fb642e5f7a7d3690d862575e01041252b07c4408c9274e70e68bedfedfca0c7282d8ee41ac1d62f278bb5aa14c8abb2426baca9bb647d738bb459cf4a61f9f1c336a8f5), to get away from that disgusting PvP shoulder grind.
---
You can, it will take some time to run though. If you are going to do this, then jump out the mountains in Valley of Trial (where Orc and Trolls starts) towards Ratchet, then use spirit healer if you die. Follow the road to Crossroads, get the flight path.
---
Run south to Camp Taurajo, get the flight path. Run into Mulgore, die and ress with spirit healer. Then run south to the starting zone where Tauren begins. This will probably take you 20-30 min doing if there is no server issues. :)
---
I played a destruction lock in WOTLK, loved that but I was also around 13. I messed around a little in cata but pretty much quit, I then did some endgame content on a hunter? In WOD, ended up burning out. The most meaningful content I did was mythic raids in Legion, but think I stopped right before TOS. I’m looking to devote less time than I have in the past to this, (L0L) and am more focused on my journey knowing none of the end game content I’m in will be as hectic as mythic raiding. I have literally ALWAYS played Horde, never got past level 20 or so on Alliance. I plan on flipping for a different experience. Given all of this what do you recommend ? I’m very interested in a human hunter, some sort of night elf druid build, human mage, or human rogue, but I really am open to suggestions. I’m leaning towards human heavily because of their rep racial, Ive grinded argent dawn rep before and a 10% increase is huge.
---
You said "daily" which has specific connotations.
---
I thought the 1-5 Quests were race locked. But everyone else says it isn't. Anyone have evidence?
---
I'm not talking about them removing bone fragments, shredders, and quest items.  We're talking about loot.  You know, the whole reason PVP was ruined?  Them removing a quest item has nothing to do with this conversation.
---
I know they nerfed AV.  They nerfed it in nearly every patch since they released it up through 1.12.  I'm not talking about this at all.  It's very clear that I'm talking about PVP rewards, since this entire thing is about PVP rewards ruining PVP.  That is literally the entirety of my first post.
---
I don't mind the work it will take, as long as the gameplay itself is rewarding (Although that is essentially what this entire thread is about: finding out which classes and playstyles are rewarding, haha!). If I roll a warrior I plan on rolling with mining and blacksmithing, which I imagine will open up *some* additional money-making opportunities, even if they aren't substantial.
---
What class are you going to play, friend, and why?
---
Part of why. The accomplishment of it all is worth it. Finishing off the grind and riding off the rock with your mount is a great feeling!
---
My boyfriend at the time tried for weeks to get me to play WoW with him. I played mostly console games at the time and was hesitant.
---
Until he showed me I could get a flamingo in game.
---
He played alliance, so I couldn't just roll a Tauren hunter. I rolled a Nelf and ran the entire way as soon as I could tame a pet. And that was my introduction to Warcraft.
---
This is actually incredible. Well done!
---
What the hell is "Classic+?"
---
If interest in Classic would only last 2-3 years then how have Blizz-like private servers thrived for over a decade?
---
Still, I understand how you wouldn't want to play the same game forever. That's why hopefully there will be other games to play after developers see how popular a game like Classic can be today. 
---
That said, as someone who's wanted Classic since Wrath, I don't see why you can't just let a classic game be a classic game. There's a reason that the Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Master Quest wasn't a timeless classic. Just let Classic be Classic and play something else if you can't stand not being spoon-fed new content by the same developer until the end of time. 
---
You don't have to remaster and retune and add on to everything. Watch original movies besides the endless re-boots and sequels. There will be other games and developers designed to cater to every changing whim in the future with constant new content but this project was meant to be for the people who wanted the original game as it was.
---
:)
---
You need college for that?
---
That's the thing, when the game first launched ALL attacks(at least melee, cant remember if ranged and magic did as well but i think they did) generated blood splatter on the ground.
---
This, not to mention the influx of undead coming to barrens also
---
With flying mounts in retail, flight paths try to catch you.
---
Sounds like Morton.
---
I haven't been on Reddit in about a month so I wasn't aware this was asked alot
---
Thanks, yeah Shimmering Flats is a break point (End of Thousand Needles, Ashenvale, etc before heading to EK) and running a duo through the flats for 20 vulture bones (or however many there are) takes a huge chunk of time.  
---
Will have a duo guide posted here, later on, for orc / troll start. Going to be running warrior rogue so the guide is pretty specific to those two classes quests but can be forked wherever class quests are involved. That's why its pretty specific =/
---
Also discussed [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bw0qam/no_changes_wheres_the_blood/).
---
I thought about that, however saving 1k gold + also farming gold is a nice combo. We'll see.
---
Humans are the worst for alliance. They offer nothing for pvp. Perp is useless. Vanish is stronger and perp cant detect it. So more or less you can just vanish the perp and be in a stronger stealth state. Plus Cats eyes/talents you can be on the same playing field.  
---
Gnome are solid as the worst problem about melee is not being able to be on top of your opponent. So it helps with slows/roots from hunters/mages/druids.  
---
Dwarfs are rather useless unless fighting other rogues mainly. And If you just wanna get out of a bleed vs a warrior but yeah (Luffa) there rather useless overall. But still better then human and NE  
---
NE, 1% dodge pretty useless shadowmeld  
---
I would say Gnome&gt;Dwarf&gt;NE&gt;Human in that order for strengths for PvP  
---
Horde  
---
Orc takes the cake the stun resist can make or break a fight and it happens very often in  your favor.  
---
UD are also strong if you're fighting locks/priest  
---
Trolls- useless.  
---
End of the day play what you want.  As everything has a CD and it won't always be up. If you enjoy looking at a certain race play that. It won't make or break you otherwise. Pro's and cons to everything in WoW classic.  
---

---
Idk why this guy thinks Blizzard is going to be like "oh man, ChromedDragon got x upvotes, we better implement his ideas stat."  I think adding zones to fill out the world after Naxx etc would be great. New experiences while keeping the classic/vanilla foundation. The reimagined zones and used of dead space is creative and fun, keep up the good work!
---
That's a weird way to spell Undercity
---
Don't forget the army of 50 or so Solliden farmers in tirisfall that subsist entirely off of pumpkins.
---
Dem boys got fucked!
---
Eat shit horde.
---
It builds *a* character.
---
If you want better early zones and more quests, alliance. 
---
If you want your faction to actually help you when you’re getting chainganked by the feral and his posse of rogues, go horde.
---
Signed, a salty alliance player who hates his faction but can’t stay away from dwarf wolen
---
Wait what are those
---
My man! Was holy specced when I did the Obsidian warbeads.
---
Now I'm going to have to read up on this grind.
---
I don't have this problem because I don't have kids. That said, who are all these kids that have so much free time? As a teen, I remember getting up at 630 and not coming home until 6. Then doing homework until 10 and maybe playing an hour of wow and falling asleep at school the next day. I don't know about you, but I have a lot more free time as an adult. I'm pumped for Classic! I can even have a raiding schedule!!!!
---
Every job annoys someone. Do you scream at a construction worker for drilling something during the day?
---
They're not screaming in a random crowded area, they're on their own site, their own channel which you don't have to be in touch with at all if you don't want to. But you're choosing to interact with them and in fact going above and beyond to attack them.
---
Only a breadcrumb at the start is race locked.  Nearly all of the quests are able to be done by any same-faction race.
---
This stream v stream world pvp is the best!
---
I'm telling you why we need old AV. Or atleast should want it over the nerfed and cut-down version.
---
Do you need to be a NE to get this? Or can a human do this quest?
---
I will pay this place many visits on my undead rogue :)

That's what I was wondering but people on here know more about classic than I do so I'm taking their word on it. Worse come to worse I just hearth back to valley of trials if there's no available quests.
---
After months of trawling the AH I got one for under 1g, happy days.
---
The fuck?
---
They'll roll whatever server they please. They owe nobody an announcement or explanation.
---
You are partially correct with 1 note:
---
* Elemental resistance only reduce the amount of damage they would take, and have zero effect on spells that deal zero damage (ex fear, mind control  etc...).
---
* spells that deal zero damage only use the "chance to hit" stat and talents that specifically reduce this hit chance  (some times those talents say "chance to reduce fear" for example)
---
Big doof
---
You don't need to preach to this choir.
---
&gt;mfw you compare streamers that make oodles of cash with someone trying to make ends meet
---
Yeah but the amount of money they have doesn't matter when there's no better alternative available. 
---
&gt;They're putting a huge target on their backs by rolling on a PVP server, on top of that. It's not about being angry with them, it's about them making themselves an honor kill and me wanting that honor kill.
---
If you can kill them without using other sources such as their stream then by all means, go for it. But if you're trying to hard to have your ''moment'' of killing them thanks to using out-of-game information then that's just scummy behavior.
---
Oh come on, you don't know how their layering or shardering system works anymore than anyone else who's not a blizzard dev. That may be the case, it also me very well be the case that it balances the load in different ways, one of which could be that they place layers on different servers. I mean, if layering is an extension of sharding, I would think that's how it works by default.
---
oh man I feel sick now too

I don't care if you PvP a streamer, that's totally fine. I'm only arguing against streamsniping, which is where you use out-of-game information like watching the streamer's livestream to know their location and kill them. I'm arguing that going that far to kill someone you don't know is just unjustifiably pathetic. But beat them in a square fight, absolutely - go for it.
---
Blizz has to make the game friendly for Chinese players. China doesn’t allow a lot of that stuff, including skulls, exposed bones and stitches on bodies. 
---
If you were to play the Chinese version of the game, it would look completely different.
---
A scarlet crusade raid sounds amazing
---
This is some amazing artwork even independent of WoW. Wonderful job.
---
Dammmnmmnmmnnnn
---
Grim batol!!! poggers
---
The art itself is really really good but it looks nothing like undercity.
---
I have 200ms to the beta server from NZ... but given we have retail servers in Sydney I don't see why they wouldn't make at least one PvP and PvE server each for Classic, at least at launch.
---
Thats how this sub goes. Thanks for noticing.
---
Uhhhh, I'm pretty sure not dude. Divine Shield at Rank 1 is 10 seconds, learned at 34. Rank 2 is 12 seconds, learned at level 50. Are you sure you're not thinking of BoP? That starts at a 6 second duration, Divine Shield never goes that short.
---
Have the same issue my friend. High stress job (but generally only 8-10 hours a day, shift work), 1 year old baby, mortgage, wife. She doesn’t game, absolutely hates it. It’s going to be a battle for me to play, but I don’t have much “me” time so I’m just going to use that as my reasoning. She’s about to go back to work part time so I’ll be looking after the little one 4 days a week. I figure I’ll play when he’s watching tv or sleeping - or late at night when I get home from work and everyone’s in bed.
---
It isn’t gonna be easy, but in 2004 I was 16, and played the absolute fuck out of this game. Can’t let this opportunity slide! I don’t want it to take 12 months to get to 60, I hate being last/slow at things, but.. it is what it is. We’ll get there :)
---
Classic expansions? Imagine that reval 2 years from now.
---
And also with 5% less intellect than a gnome mage.
---
I have 200ms to the beta server from NZ.
---
you are playing an roleplay game with 7 different and unique races, and humans. do you realy want to play with people who pic humans? the most boring race there is. they must be so boring themself that they think "better stick to humans, everything else is too exciting for me"
---
Literally, please, I beg of you Blizzard, implement an OSRS type system where the community can vote for new content lile this. We don't want a slow ascension back in to retail. I can promise literally hundreds of my own dollars though if content like this could be added into classic.
---
The fuck? Did you just respond to your own 200 paragraph post dismissing the entire thing in one sentence?
---
No, you should be correct. He's probably thinking of BoP.
---
100%. Idk how the guys critiquing you for taking your career seriously. I do the same in a different line of work. Sure, I'm sluggish on the 14th hour (today), but I still get shit done in a much more professional and efficient way than nearly anyone else. Which is also why I get paid well lol
---
Sortof but not quite. That topic is about the particle effects in combat. I'm talking literal pools of blood when the game first launched. I dont think the cvar violence level added that back, only the particle effects if i understand correctly?
---
I remember I didn't know how to rebind keybinds, and 1-6 was reserved for buttons I was used to dpsing with, so I put all my tanking abilities on 9 to = and hit them with my right hand while keyboard turning with my left. Honestly had no idea what I was thinking.
---
Yeah mine was either 30s or 3g, i was tempted to send them a chunk of change to apologise, but thought that'd probably cut deeper than being left in ignorance.

It's too bad my friends want to roll Horde... thank you for abreast allowing me to relive the feels here.

The rep was increased in patch 2.3. The Zul'Aman patch FYI. :) I farmed it way before that.
---
Would it be worth leveling alchemy? Been leaning towards blacksmithing just because it seems cool.
---
Where is the mailbox ?
---
You selling this ?
---
I swear I remember trying to do it back in Vanilla and it was race locked. I might be wrong, but I think people are thinking of all the other quests in the starting zones, not the first few.
---
&gt; Kiting with hamstring and a slow weap mitigates just as much dmg as blocking does.
---
They've messed up mob melee leniency, making hamstring/earthbind kiting waaaay harder.
---
legit reason, who can say no to that thicc booty?
---
Those “blacklisted” should form a guild called “Streamers Bane” with the sole purpose of ganking then as often as possible.
---
Oof
---
It’s on my list
---
Thats... that’s the point of a beta, yeah
---
Yes, especially in 1v1 scenarios you can substitute grenades. In group play however those grenades are not as reliable since they are not a true stun and any dmg breaks it, so any cleave, aoe, or dots will make the grenade quasi useless.
---
The thing is that grenades can be ADDED to the warstomp combos. Makes your matchup vs healing classes even better, since you can do ES stomp ES Grenade ES for even longer lockouts. 
---
To answer your question, yes in a fashion grenades do reduce the value of warstomp to a degree. I would still argue that warstomp + grenades beats Hardiness + grenades.
---
Yeah, the Chinese censoring is very noticeable in their version of wow. But this change was done way before china joined in on the fun, i think they removed the blood due to complaints from parents if i remember correctly.
---
Married, 6 year old and 2 year old boys. Work 5-7 days a week. I shall find time, even if it's an hour a day lol

---
I'd say the spirit and stealth detect can make up for the tiny upgrade that 5% int is.
---
Owe is a strong burden, but honestly an announcement or statement of some kind will only help them. Their followers will be able to play with them/get the exposure they crave and everyone else wont have to qq when they accidentally gank them and are blacklisted
---
Would you rather be a gnome, or kill a gnome?
---
I played since the vanilla open betas and I have no recollection at all of "literal pools of blood".
---
I think you're mis-remembering...
---
And they're delaying 8.2 because of the Beta.
---
In patch 2.3 the rep per quest was increased. Half the story is worse than a lie. Learn your facts. It wasn't nerfed with the release of TBC. Check patch notes for 2.3. I like how many people downvoted me as well lol.
---
Inb4 “REEEEEEEE STREAMERS REEEEEEEEEE”
---
What is the benefit of them rolling pvp? They are content creators. The only content they will miss out on is wpvp, but can ppl just flag pvp on a pve server and still do city raids?
---
Hahahahahahahahahahahah take your dam upvote!
---
My ass
---
If this is in the game, exploit early bois or get left behind in the dust.
---
I’m an activision Blizzard shareholder so I want them to monetize the hell out of classic
---
Try them all out. There’s a few streamers Reddit hates but don’t let them deter you and just find the streamer you click with the most.
---
&gt;nerdiness splurge but if this was vanilla design philosophy, there would really only be a Ardent dawn village/keep/stronghold that is accessible to both horde/alliance. and the entire area would be way more messed up by scourge with potential combination of demon areas due to the lore of demon influence of scarlet crusade and the actual influence for their hate for undead grew so much blah blah.
---
Sort of agree, mostly because I don't see either Horde or Alliance showing much interest in Lordearon at the vanilla point in time. Forsaken didn't even really do anything with Plaguelands aside from guarding the border despite being adjacent to their capital city. The place is just too much of a shitfest and fighting the Scourge at that point in time is practically a fool's errand. Both factions were pretty content on just letting the Paladins get fussy about that while they prioritise other places.
---
Most of the area would indeed likely be a copy of the mushroom area on Eastern Plaguelands as a result of the northern part being most heavily assaulted by the Scourge.
---
I don't agree with the demon area however. The Scourge and demons don't get along at all, and neither do the Scarlet Crusade. Yes, they are being influenced by Nathrezim, but there's a big difference between a Nathrezim disguising himself and just general demons. If there was still any demons left there then it'd also make no sense for Balnazzar to opt for becoming the shadow leader of the Scarlet Crusade instead of just leading the local demons.
---
&gt;the clean split of a horde and alliance village in each zone is too much TBC and beyond mentality.
---
I'm fairly certain that every post-level 20 zone (i.e. actually contested zones) do have both Horde and Alliance hubs, or alternatively a Goblin/neutral village. The main difference is that the villages tend to not be sized the same or potentially do not have a flight master. For that matter, of the 5 maps so far:
---
- Wildhammer Highlands has a lot of hubs and is quite full for both factions
---
- Blackened Marshes has a large and a small hub for both factions
---
- Ship's End Cove only has a neutral hub for Horde, while Alliance has 2 more hubs including a large one
---
- Savage Coast has no Alliance hub besides the one in the adjacent zone, and only one small Horde hub. Aside from that, neutral hub.
---
- Northern Lordearon has a small Alliance hub and a large Horde hub
---
I'd say the first two have more TBC+ design style of hubs, but the latter 3 fit fine IMO (besides the fact that Horde/Alliance would likely not be interested in that area of the world).
---
&gt;But beat them in a square fight, absolutely 
---
Fair fight? This is pvp we're talking about. Piss them off till they send you hate tells whining about how unfair life is. An mmo with anything less isn't rewarding enough to be worth playing.
---
Gnomes suck ass
---
The only streamers who like the idea of blacklisting players on the realm are asmon and soda. All other streamers think the idea is beyond ridiculous and don't plan to participate. Also, some of them even welcome sniping because they truly enjoy world pvp battles.
---
Everyone hates it apparently but the movie is pretty hype. I started playing wc3 and it’s quite good. Also I got recommendations for the Warcraft chronicles 1-3. I just ordered the 1st on prime and will be getting it tomorrow.
---
Almost same. Family, full time, heavily into lifting for about 13 years. I'm gonna take PTO for the first time ever that doesn't include just going to the zoo, and I think I'll be able to get a solid 8 hours a day for that week since my wife will take care of the other shit.
---
But like u said, just because I'm taking the week off doesn't mean I get 16 hours a day. Kids still need to be fed, played with, and taken care of on top of household things. My wife can be neglected for a week though lol
---
Where does the smoke go from all of their fires?
