I don't think you've seen a properly geared elem shaman. They have more than just burst. They *do* have some insane burst, some of the best in game even, but what makes you think frost shocks hitting for 600 every 5 seconds is low damage? They also have pretty decent white hits when vs melee, adding in WF on that, a searing totem, they have just fine consistent damage. Their dps is lacking in long PvE fights, but PvP fights don't ever go that long, even the long ones. 
---

---
They are better than the rest of the casters, namely for - Purge. And they are a more challenging class, not a worse class like you seem to think. Mages, Warlocks, and Priests can all do much better in PvP with *less* effort. It takes a lot more gearing and bindings / downranks for an elem shaman to do just as well / better. 
---
Check some videos of them geared out to aq 40 gear, they are absolute beasts.
---
---
---
They want to seem relevant. Everyone hated blink charging and vanish charging. You may notice it mostly hurts one class.
---
That's something I've been thinking about. There are quite a few more items with on-hit effects, like gloves. But there is basicly no information on the matter, wether it scales or not on classic.  
---
Do you got any information on how a shaman with a setup like this fares ?  
---
I also heard about infamous spell power rogues approaching 3k dps, so even if it'd scale, I believe rogues faster attack speed and dual wieldability would still outperform us in that regard, right ?
---
I've seen this that type of "hit and run" narcissism and passive aggressive attitude. The way most of their comments are about managing you, even when you are totally calm and just disagreeing. It's a subtle way to criticize the person and make them feel like the bad guy, "Oh you don't have to be angry, we are just disagreeing" followed by a few flirty patronizing smilies.
---
Shoutout to WoWEmu.. if it wasn't so shit, MaNGOS or Trinity would probably never come about.

Using the kinect as mouse input
---
Subs may be dying down by last I heard Retail is still making money hand over fist from microtransactions.
---
What is the importance of native language? 1.5 billion people speak English.
---
Reading this felt like i was having a stroke.
---
&gt; The question I just can't find the answer to. I've OBVIOUSLY given this much thought since 2017. I have narrowed it down to two answers for the question but that's not really the question. The question really is not this as swell, its actually another one. So the question is actually something that I can't find an answer to.  
---
AS TO YOUR ACTUAL FUCKING QUESTION:  
---
I'd go warlock if I were you. No guild will let you play ret paladin and invest the ~10k gold and the Eye of sulfuras in you, considering the showcase of your social skills in the OP.  
---
Unless of course you're in a guild with a bunch of friends, but I somehow doubt that will be the case.  
---
So yea, go warlock. At least you'll have someone to play with, as your pets won't be able to run away for you.
---
...well I mean, it definitely was what we needed
---
yes look at his xp bar, could even be in tbc launch.
---
Yeah.. my problem is: will they remove it? I know what has been said, but im not convinced at all. I will wait and see, if they remove it, great, I can enjoy the game and all is well. If not, I wont even bother.
---
You heal in raids, place appropriate totems and downrank chainheal pretty much. In pvp, 30/0/21 if I'm not mistaken can be quite strong due to versatility and burst potential. Also the usual totem support, purge and earthshock. Aside from that, everything else seems to be memeworthy, which is quite a shame.  
---
Ah, forgot the infamous Nightfall axe bot, when your guild doesn't have a hunter that enjoys spamming lvl1 wingclip for maximum buff uptime.
---
Every healing class is "stuck healing." It's called using your class to it's fullest. And if there's 16 debuff slots from the beginning you might be able to Shadow weave in raids from the get go. But I'm assuming you want to play Shadow priest for the pvp so... what's the issue?
---
&gt; It’s a 12 year old game that is supposed to be brought back in the state it was left. We don’t want them to polish it. It has been done for 12 years.
---
I for one am glad they're rebuilding the back end to run on and take advantage of modern server architecture.
---
or even WoW 2
---
There are people on this sub who literally have either a victimhood, or inferiority complex about Classic.
---
I've played this game since 2005 and I would've been fine if they didn't bring this back. I feel like most of the people advocating for no changes didn't actually play. It feels shitty when you kick a mage and get sheeped.
---
What’s different between WoW 2 and a new expansion? 
---
Sheath swords and daggers on the back.
---
Can you not moonwalk in retail?
---
&gt; Many retail players believe Classic is taking away resources from retail.
---
Citation needed. Give me numbers. What % of the retail playerbase gives two shits about classic?
---
PS. Unlike the victim culture we have here, r/wow is cautiously optimistic about classic.
---
\&gt; This is a problem because of phasing, not sharding.   
---
No. Again, I know the difference between the two. No phasing involved and this does happen. Especially in big raid groups, you can google it and see tons of evidence. Please, I literally explained it so read more carefully.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
\&gt; Once again its negligible in the grand picture. Are people gonna quit  the game because they didn't get a green item at level 10? No. They  might quit because they have 1000ms and after hours of trying they still  can't complete a single quest.   
---
I dont care what other people end up doing, but I will quit if sharding is in the game.
---
\&gt; If you are so worried about missing out on a node, then just wait with  the party invite till you are finished with it. Even so, if you lose  half of the nodes you find this way, you will still get more than you  would without sharding. 
---
Yeah, and this is why me and my friends quit retail. Spend half your time battling stupid systems that interrupts gameplay.. sure, you can avoid a ton of sharding issues by doing X and Y and blabla.. or you know, they could just remove the whole thing as it has no positive sides at all? Thatd be great.  
---
&gt;Blizzard is already starting to feel like their old self.
---
I'm not sure what to think because It's still the same corporation which milked this game for all it was worth and turned the Warcraft universe upside down and inside out
---
Can't wait to see the amount of salt that will pour out of your forehead when you realize that this means that everyone is now back to being able to jump charge and intercept.
---
Death is close...
---
Quit your job and abandon your family obviously, you filthy casual.
---
Don't do professions while you level unless you like wasting time. It will go faster at 60 when u have a mount.  Goblin v gnomish engineer just depends on if u want a very specific recipe like the rocket boots (which are amazing, big recommend). I suggest doing first aid while u level tho as it's not a big time sync and bandages are a necessity. As for your secondary prof, it's preference. I plan on keeping engineer/herbalism on my druid and have a 2nd 60 with alchemy but idk what all the cool kids are doing these days. 
---
XD
---
We gave our first Sulfuras to the one we knew would be able to farm the insane amounts of gold needed so it didn't end up just taking a slot in his bank. The farm is quite crazy...
---
Did you even play vanilla? Auto attacks bound to 1 lol
---
Interesting, I've always rated discord slightly above Skype for overall audio quality.
---
Imo teamspeak always rated as the best with vent and mumble as tied for second.
---
It's ok most of the time, but it echoes occasionally.
---
[removed]
---
implying that's a bad thing
---
Eh, the issue i didnt care about gets changed.
---
The best part about this is that its news. Otherwise meh.
---
Except there were plenty of PServers before ...
---
Actually, time was created at the big bang if you want to be technical.
---
Hey all, this is my first time doing any sort of thing like this, so feel free to leave any constructive criticisms. Hope you enjoy!
---
Although English is not my first language, I think I got my point across. I have been thinking about what race/class combo to play, and have done so since 2017. I narrowed it down to two choices, but after all this time of thinking, I figured out that what race/class combo to play is not the question that I had to find an answer to. The question I have to find an answer to is if I wanna play what I want or what is good. Hope that clarifies it. As for playing Ret, I only said I would Ret in PvP, so why wouldn't a guild allow me to play Ret is PvP?? That is a ridiculous statement. I think your reply is toxic and full of shit!
---
No definitely wasnt tbc.  I can assure you of this.  Thats just remainder xp and the green bar isnrested
---
Vent was free to self host for up to 10 users, and it was extremely common for guilds to have their own paid vent server.
---
Mumble came out in 2005 and had voice support from the very first alpha version.
---
There was also teamspeak that came out in 2001.
---
No such thing as world pvp....it's not a troll if you think about it
---
You forgot to repeat that sentence 2 or 3 times worded differently. 
---
Not a troll.....use your melon bro
---
A little harsh. I'm really asking for an opinion with some reasoning behind it. For I know that I don't know everything there is to know about the game.  I can be influenced, you know. I was just asking for a little guidance.
---
Because it's official news.
---
Official news = 10 minute videos
---
10 minute videos = $
---
This guy gets it
---
I still play retail. The general vibe I get from a lot of people is supportive of authentic classic, though most see it as a crazy time sink that they can't/won't commit to. I would not be surprised if many retailers play classic casually since it is included in the subscription.
---
Regarding communication: I think that those who choose to play Classic will be friendly, as the pace of the game will keep most of the most impatient people away. Also, I find players/personalities like Nixxiom obnoxious in general (even set my youtube to never suggest any of his videos) and can fully understand people not wanting unsolicited communication with him.
---
That is what Im hoping for, If I end up with Paladin I will start to farm for it from day 1. Not even gonna do the Charger questline until I have the gold for the hammer. Lets say I have managed to farm 5 ingots when it drops, is it suppose to go to a Tank or DPS Warrior instead of me? If that's the case they I won't even play Classic WoW because of ridiculous loot norms.
---
Flip a coin.
---
A. You like the outcome.   
---
B. You reflip. This tells you what you really want to play. By not getting the outcome you truely wanted, you know that you want A.
---
Auto attack on 1 and only Key bindings are the default. Ah, the days of yore. 
---
can u drink from my skull
---
Dude, this was amazing! 
---
I just binged watched about half of your channel, and now I've finally decided that I'm going to roll priest in Classic! (The priest vanilla flavours video was amazing!) 
---
I always thought WoW was worth the money, because there was so much content I would never run out of stuff to do. Meanwhile I knew people who thought it was "dumb" to have to pay a subscription for a game you already bought. Meanwhile these same people had no issue paying for xbox live and $60 for a game they'd beat in 8 hours.
---
I'll have some of what you're smoking please :)
---
and other jokes you tell yourself
---
Can you explain what jump charge is, please?
---
Gotta get that wanding in while your mp5 is ticking :P
---
EZ, roll resto shaman, drop WF totem, and live vicariously through the warriors in your group. Guaranteed raid spot and if you have to leave for months another guild will pick you up there day you log back in.
---
In all seriousness though, play the class you're drawn to the most. If that means finding a guild with similar time constraints, then do that.
---
I’m looking for some help deciding between priest, druid, and shaman for general questing during leveling and healing late game. I’ve leveled a priest but that was during WotLK and I used dungeon finder a lot to level faster. So I suppose my real questions are how do they compare leveling solo and healing at endgame. 
---
Are you trying to kill me by giving me another stroke?  
---
&gt; As for playing Ret, I only said I would Ret in PvP, so why wouldn't a guild allow me to play Ret is PvP?? 
---
You need to raid to get The Hand of Rag. Are you saying that you're going to heal in raids and get it for an offspecc over someone else?  
---
&gt; The question I have to find an answer to is if I wanna play what I want or what is good.
---
How are we supposed to answer that? Especially when you already answered your own question. See: "I wanna play what I want or what is good".
---
I just hope this isn't an isolated case of the vanilla team being passionate as fukk and the rest of blizz is off creating more pets for the store and catering retail to drooling 7 year olds and passing it off as CLASS FANTASY.
---
I like this.. a lot. Thank you
---
People did make videos about it though? People noticed there was no spell batching in the demo, and after people DID notice and were making posts about it on the forums, they got banned/had their posts removed. There were some videos too. 
---
And of course there are videos on it again now because it's more news and another win for the classic community. It was in vanilla, so it'll be in classic.
---
You basically have it solved yourself I'd say. 2/3 of your OP is talking about how much you like tanking lol.
---
If you are keeping it casual, what does it matter? You will always be needed for 5 mans, and once people start getting gear there WILL be pugs for all sorts of raids. Sure you might not make it to end game raiding, but you already said you want to keep it casual and slow.
---
tl;dr - You want to do it casual because you are busy adult, so just do what you have the most fun doing.
---
Heh. I would, but unfortunately I prefer that Alliance scum! :P
---
With that being said, I may just have to take your 2nd bit of advice.
---
As the warrior charges/intercepts you, you just jump away (back/sideways) and he's out of range. Not sure about tauren tho
---
So it sounds like raiding is out of the question.. do you want to tank or heal 5 man dungeons? I can tell you leveling as a shadow priest is a heal of a lot easier than warrior, so perhaps do priest first, then see if you have time for warrior. Good luck, OP.
---
let me mod my client so I can make my armor and weapons look good on my end. people did it back in vanilla and reskinned their weapons into things like the Ashbringer. Only you could see it so it never hurt anything.
---
21-39, every druid in WSG: 
---
\#TREMBLE MORTALS AND DESPAIR, DOOM HAS COME TO THIS BATTLEGROUND.
---
40, okay, well now everyone's mounted, but I have my travel form, maybe if I stick it out it'll get better.
---
41, well that was rough, but I'm the lowest level in this BG, maybe things are getting better.
---
42. Screw it, let's just play a class that's decent. 
---
Thanks. This really gives me more hope in the tanking aspect. I think I may still make a healer to have, but.. you've given me more hope for the Tank to be my main
---
Sulfuras is bad for PvE content, it is a PvP weapon that is best used by Paladins and Shamans. Also I don't think you have played much Vanilla, I have raided on private servers and you can barely say there is such a thing as "progress". The content is so easy that one Warrior crafting Sulfuras for 10k gold to have it for 1 month before he gets a BRE is ridiculous.
---
Just be clear of your intentions when looking for a guild. Its not like all the guilds operate under the same rules. 
---
Wait is this true? Can anyone confirm? I only played pve in vanilla (Cenarius represent!) so I wouldn’t know 
---
I leveled a warrior in vanilla! It was certainly Hell. But made for a good challenge. I envied the advice I got from someone that said make the healer first that way the warrior can be supplied. But you are right in the difficulty stats.
---
Quality?  Dunno.
---
Subs?  Yes.  Wife and i gave up on retail in pandaland.  But we'll be back subbed solely for classic.
---
Oh so once I learn the spell, it applies to other pets?
---
Having unkillable NPC vendors and quest givers would be extra retarded and FAR more immersion breaking than getting a DK for killing them.
---
Nobody needs a farming alt, it takes too long to lvl a 2nd 60 and you can easily make gold with any class and get by with cheap gear. If u do want to make gold, you just have to farm longer or sell your tanking services. I could expound but tbh it just comes down to that.
---
Why not just find a suitible guild that will let you be a MT? There's going to be several adult only/adults with kids etc etc guilds setting up even before the servers go live.
---
Honestly I see that as your best option 
---
&gt;Though anyone who works in software can attest that understanding your own code isn't always a given :-) 
---
Guilty
---
I played private server mage, warlock and priest just to see how it felt. Dude. Embrace the demon. Warlocks are so fucking dank in Vanilla wow
---
Like the other dude says, just don't play UD and you'll be fine. Mulgore is especially relaxing. 
---
You simply spam jump while moving in a direction, preferably away from the warrior you expect to charge/intercept you. This way, if the skill goes off while you're in the air your momentum doesn't stop and you're carried forward even while the stun is applied to you. Basically the warrior doesn't end up on top of you after they charge you.
---
I can't wait for the Classic Server discords, it will be like the forums but better.
---
I get what you're trying to say but I never really understood the mentality. Coming from other MMORPGs like FF11 that didn't have the 6 month subscription option it didn't really seem that much. $40 something for 6 months worth of gameplay was pennies. I know people that go drinking on the weekend, smoke, or spent stupid amounts of money on other entertainment. It seems like you really need to struggle to call it expensive. I grew up in a pretty poor area and they always had the latest things, whether it was something eletronic back in day the like pagers or some other fad. 
---
&gt; I made so many characters even making a twink before I had a 60
---
I thought I was the only one!
---
Honestly it's pretty doable, especially if your twink is a druid, especially a tauren druid for deviate farming. 
---
i dunno...maybe a complete new modern engine and a 2019 game rather than a patchwork 15 year old game?
---
Honestly I want to play Shadow for everything, Dungeons, Raids, PvP. I don't want to ever have to respec but I realize its wishful thinking. Shadow prob won't be a real thing until Naxx when the Mana battery thing really becomes something people want in groups. I guess I'll have to settle on healing for the most part if I want in groups.
---
bzzzzzt
---
wrong
---
Shit, come back after lunch and being lost reading your code definitely never happens...
---
And you won't be 60 at launch. 
---
&gt;Also I don't think you have played much Vanilla, I have raided on private servers and you can barely say there is such a thing as "progress".
---
I played plenty of "Vanilla", back when it was actually vanilla. You're correct that I haven't touched private servers.
---
What? How is killing a quest NPC griefing? So there shouldn't be any town/city attacks? What??
---
Just call for help in the local defense channel, that's how world PvP works.
---
Let's hold off on praise here.. 
---
we dont even have this in rertail wich is a bummer :/
---
I take it then Risen's reputation wasn't so good on alliance side? Was Failure (Failz?) a power-hungry GM?
---
That was the cost for the epic ground mount in TBC when they reduced it. 
---
In vanilla the riding costs 900g and the mount is 100g before reputation / PvP discounts come in.
---
Why wouldnt I get it for Ret as a Healer if It is a Ret weapon and I have used thousands of gold to prepare the mats?
---
And What is wrong with asking for advice when choosing either WHAT I WANT TO PLAY(Not so strong in PvP) vs WHAT IS GOOD(Orc Warlock is really strong in PvP)? Seems like a reasonable question to me, I think you are the one having a hard time here.
---
stop calling pve gear pvp gear just because you intend to use it in pvp 
---
Paladin and shaman on the same raid team? Puh, nice try, poser. 
---
The "character is looking at map" animation. 
---
&gt;To get some alliance to come out and contest us. It was to set off local defense warnings and generate some world pvp.
---
So why did everyone leave when an npc was killed? Did that not set off the local defense warnings that you wanted?
---
Join a hardcore min/max guild. We could clear MC in an hour or less. Or split your raid 20/20 and clear 2 hours
---
Mostly because they forgot about it and lets be real for a minute 70% of classic players didnt even know about this anyway.
---
I would mind. I want an authentic Classic experience.
---
&gt;I think your reply is toxic and full of shit!
---
It's honestly not though. He's just answering your question man. You might be misinterpreting him, possibly because English is your second language. 
---
I did that in LoL. Had some sort of “galactic Anivia” skin
---
Stop playing the 1.12 card, they are using 1.12 as a base, if it was in vanilla, it should be discussed and considered to be added.
---
There was a time with no DKs, it's a legitimate suggestion, and I consider it to be a great encouragement of world pvp, to be rid of DKs. People who cry can roll on PvE realms, also it's broadcasted in the localdefense channel every time you kill a civillian, people can also ask for help.
---
I do like orc, but im not a big fan of Horde overall, plus Horde gets more warlocks anyway. 
---
You are Very Right. I keep assuming that I have to be in this very active guild with strict raiding times and rules. When really, the larger majority of the this Classic player base (given recent polls) prove most players will be returning Vanilla players, who are more-than-likely in my shoes as far as situation. Of Course there will be hardcore raiders still. But you're right! I really didn't think about this.
---
How underwhelming.
---
Theres more complexity and difficulty (read - actual mechanics) in BC raids
---
classic is fucking easy mode man
---
I played both before DKs was added, and after. 
---
DKs did severely reduced world PvP.
---
Then I understand. You should know that Vanilla content is very easy, not saying private servers are 100% correct, but they more or less are. I can put on follow on someone and go eat. It will still be cleared in 2-3 hours max. Bossfights literally last for like 1 minute.
---
I had a thread written on my realm's forum about how "horde only wins WSG if \[my character, a flag-running druid\] is in it!" that was my five seconds of fame. 
---
Which is why they should just remove DKs.
---
Our server had a poll on the most famous trolls on our server and I got third place. Rip. 
---
I find it really sad that the dominant problem points are basically "there's not enough content" and "there's no real content". 
---
Uh, yeah. WoW had more content that pretty much any game ever made, because it has 15+ years of really good quality zones, mobs, quests, challenges, dungeons, etc -- it has near infinite content. 
---
But Blizzard has made all of that "non-content" by nuking it down to just being a zerg AOE / mobility / collecto-fest. It just blows my mind...
---
"There's no content"... YES, there is, it's called Felwood, it's a dope zone, just make the creepy infected furbolgs and corruption and ghosts and satyrs actually feel dangerous and foreboding enough to raise the hair on your spine a little. There are hundreds of awesome zones and regions and dungeons like this that, if difficult, would be "real content" that players could enjoy. Leveling IS the content, it has to be, because that is the only way to make the awesome game design work done for, say, WotlK still be something that today adds value to your game. 
---
It's just lunacy to me - you're deprecating all the good shit your own designers and artists have done, and then players have nothing to do, but... like every zone almost is epic and full of great stuff to do in theory. 
---
Nothing rallies my fellow hordies in world pvp than my "LOOKS LIKE MEATS BACK ON THE MENU BOYS" cannibalize macro.
---
DKs were added a long with battlegrounds, you are delusional if you don't think DKs had an impact on the death of world pvp.
---
Throughout this entire thread you've constantly justified why you're going to play paladin. So play Paladin. It's obviously what you want to do. 
---
Westfall is my favourite area in WoW by far.
---
Using the logic you're basically saying that since shamans are faction restricted then only 50% of the player base is represented in the poll for popularity. So yeah you double it. Or better yet halve the other classes to take away their "alliance" votes and see who wins. Either way shamans seem very popular which is nuts.
---
In Canada it was like $50 after taxes for a two-month game card. The game was so addictive and beyond it's time that I never questioned the cost
---
When I first heard of MMOs when my buddy bought Star Wars galaxies, I could not believe it had a monthly subscription fee.  Couldn’t fathom that.  
---
When WoW came out I happily subbed and then didn’t buy a single other video game for about 2 years.  I never felt I had to rationalize it because of how much I enjoyed the game, but I suppose you could say that $360 over 2 years is less than I would have spent if I never played wow and continued to purchase games at the rate that I was prior to playing.
---
He is mocking my english, saying I have poor social skills, and that no one wants to play with me unless I have a class with pets. I honestly think you are full of shit aswell, sorry.
---
"In hindsight, that hilarious pun may not have been the greatest comment"
---
I like this
---
Yes we'd all like clarity and specifics, but that's different than the other issues which were actually problems that the community wanted changed.
---
There's also zero gameplay reason to use sharding anywhere else during classic. If they have to use sharding during the AQ event because the alternative is a crashing server people can't get into, guess what? Most people are going to be okay sharding AQ with 25% of their server during the event instead of crashing with 100% of them.
---
WoW classic is just soo on point. Who would have thought putting dedicated and passionate individuals instead of cost analysis businessmen in charge of decision making would actually work!
---
Yeah, 12 buttons is a lot. I don't use them all either. At least not in-game. For gaming the mouse is only to supplement the keyboard, and not replace it. For productivity they basically simulate the numpad layout for me though. Really nice to be able to keep my hand on the mouse when needing numpad keys.
---
Ah, I see you're a man of culture as well...
---
#nochanges
---
&gt; they could not risk getting a single DK while they where competing against others for HKs.
---
lol, some people play for pvp. some people play for gear. 
---
"hey guys I can't pvp with you until I am sure I have the best possible gear first"
---
I'm in a similar spot. I'm always torn between priest and warrior and I worry I wont have enough time to commit to a warrior, certainly not enough to be a main tank or anything like that. I've decided to go fury - it's fun dps with a lot less responsibility than a full time tank, but still perfectly capable of tanking 5 mans and OTing in raids. Best of both worlds.
---
&gt;what is wrong with asking for advice
---
What's wrong is when you're only doing it to confirm the answer you've already decided upon and you get mad when anyone suggests the alternative. On the flip side, that should tell you which one you should play, since that's the only answer you feel is valid. 
---
It was an honest question and you provided a pretty terrible answer, even if you’re being a smartass. 
---
Fine.  
---
You're missing a variable. How are you going to raid? Will it be in a casual or hardcore guild? Or are you planning to pug ony, mc, zg and aq20?
---
Healers in general don't require as much consumables as other roles while raiding. Again, are you pugging or are you in a guild with certain requirements?  
---
As for the roles... Maintanks have to have solid attendance, that's true, however offtanks and healers can also be difficult to replace. Once again, it comes down to your raiding environment.  
---
If I were you I wouldn't worry about letting guild mates down and go the pug route with the character I want to play. Ony, mc, zg and aq20 are easily pugable and I expect there to be organized runs each week, especially when guilds start progressing through newer content and start doing split runs for specific items.
---
yeah it's an awesome change, warriors are way too OP in vanilla and anything that nerfs them is great
---
&gt; Stop playing the 1.12 card, they are using 1.12 as a base, if it was in vanilla, it should be discussed and considered to be added.
---
DHKs were in Vanilla literally 90% of the time the honor system was in place. You are asking Blizz to restore a broken version of the honor system (b/c they immediately fixed it) just so people can grind R14 a little more easily.
---
That is just because people only reply on the subject of Paladin and Sulfuras. But yeah, I do WANT to play Paladin, but maybe I should go with something better instead. Its like if a PvE Warrior wants to play Gnome, but then considering Human because its better.
---

I feel ya.  Nearing 30 as well, and really can’t to the 1 AM weekday gaming sesh anymore.  
---
Good times doing that back in high school though! 
---
No, it's just another indication that pvp'ers are the biggest whiners when it comes to their precious honor points.
---
Spot me then. I think that price is ridiculous for a game we paid for and then had to pay monthlys for. It's greed at its foundation.
---
Erm, no.
---
I'm not asking for any changes to the honor system, I'm asking for the removal of DKs, to encourage more world PvP, you know, the whole horde vs alliance thing.
---
&gt;**The question I just can't find an answer to**
---
Better title would have been "the question I just won't accept the answer to". 
---
Fury Warrior isn't going to by my class, but since you asked for some feedback here's mine:
---
Nothing really sets this apart from any other guide IMO, I can't really cross reference your video to theirs (easily) because it's 30 minutes long, which is quite, quite long.  Some maps of the Dungeons giving reference for the mobs will help new players, as well as showing SS's or again, names of the NPC's for these quest chains you reference, and even icons for the items. It's a lot of work and I'm not on the creator side, so I'm sure it's even more than I imagine.
---
On another note and please don't take this personally, but the voice over also sounds slightly nasally, like you may be congested or are not speaking as clearly as you can. I would just suggest practicing that on both extremes, listen to yourself recorded trying to sound as nasally as possible, then the opposite; which sounds better, where does your natural voice fall?  It's simple things like this that can turn away some listeners, or make them skip through some content. It's also the same easy fix that can win you over more viewers.  
---
I'm not sold that pre-bis guides are optimal via video format, since it's just so much to sift through and cross-reference piece by piece, it's much more feasible to have one massive document of each piece, and then a guide on the side that tells you which dungeons to prioritize at which stages of the game. Maybe UBRS is going to be way easier after a month or two, compared to say Strath, etc. I would focus on those recommendations compared to the things that have already been tried and true, and given to us in about a dozen different guides.  
---
Good luck, n cheers
---
WTF i was literally just thinking how this would never make it in to classic. blizzard i love u right now!
---
Ah, thanks! I think I used Quest Helper actually, now that you mention it!
---
Crashing isn't an issue. If private servers can handle 10k realms with minimal problems, Blizzard can handle retail sized realms (which are significantly smaller, a quarter of the size) without problems.
---
&gt; But yeah, I do WANT to play Paladin
---
So play Paladin.
---
Well not really me personally but my guild got ther own hate song from the horde, where they showed off how they ran around killing us in openworld prefered if we were low level, its actually pretty bad, but hey heres some cringe for u
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZHouVVcDiI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZHouVVcDiI)
---
No I have not gotten mad because of people suggesting the alternative(Orc Warlock). I am getting "mad" because people say Tanks should get Sulfuras, my social skills are bad etc etc
---
Well ... that story turned out exactly how I imagined ...
---
Ok im blocking you now since you are just making stuff up and trying to be annoying.
---
&gt; But I really liked the world and community and how everyone interacted a lot more in the pre 1.5
---
Battlegrounds killed that. Do you want to remove battlegrounds from Classic?
---
See, I think waiting to release RPvP servers was precisely what kneecapped them and led to this idea that they're such a niche thing in the first place. The first RPvP servers didn't go live until 1.8, nearly a year after WoW launched, by which point most of those who might have wanted to play on that type of realm originally had already established a presence on another server. Sure, a lot of folks made the jump anyway, but I'd wager at least as many decided it wasn't worth losing all the character progress and community connections they'd made.
---
If Blizz waits until after Classic launches to roll out RPvP realms they'll effectively repeat their original mistake and the same thing will happen. Whereas, if they release at least one RPvP realm (I'd prefer two, so I can play both factions, but I'd settle for one at first) in each region at launch I genuinely believe they'll be surprised by how popular they are. I'm confident they'll be at least as popular as regular RP servers; quite a bit *more* popular, if the survey done here a few months back is any indication.
---
ACTUALLYALLY, we don't know that's true, despite being popularized by Hawking.  There are competing theories, and we just don't have enough data yet to know.
---
Can someone list all the episodes from the picture? 
---
i doubt you gonna need those for classic.
---
&gt; I'm asking for the removal of DKs, to encourage more world PvP, you know, the whole horde vs alliance thing.
---
removal of DKs is #Changes, which is what I was pointing out
---
Lock design for vanilla is so dope because while I think Warlock peaked mechanically and thematically under Xelnath's love, and the vanilla warlock really does have some design problems... the entirety of the class is just so "play it as you wish". Now I know there are 1-2 dominant builds for both PVE and PVP, but outside of that, you really can optimize for what you want to do (ie, soloing elites, leveling speed, multi dotting in AV, etc) and create a totally non-cookie cutter build that works. 
---
And class fantasy wise, you really do feel like as you play the game, you go deeper and deeper on this journey to flirt with dark forces and sell your soul for overwhelming power. You start out as a Mage who just never really fitted in with his straight-edged peers, and you're essentially just casting your bolt and wanding, and then you take on these epic quests to further go your own way and grow into a full-fledged evil badass who's able to do so many fucking cool, useful things (but at a price). 
---
To me it is totally a good class for casual / RPers too, because these players will never really master the class, and they'd surely output more DPS as Mage/Rogue/Warr, but they get to undergo this amazing journey, and they will still experience this growth from basically a gimped mage to a complete badass. 
---
It worked in vanilla
---
Grrrr this was literally my best friend back in the days of vanilla. I hit 60 (not quickly mind you) on my main, BGs released, and I got to like rank 5 or 6 before he even got a character to 50!
---
He has sworn that he won't do this again when classic comes out as we are once again planning to duo level all these years later. I hold out mad hope that he will stick to one character at least to have a 60 before going alt crazy. Probably not though lol. 
---
Spell Batching matters A LOT to PvPers.
---
There are two kinds of Vanilla PvP videos:
---
1. OMG look at my big numbers
---
2. People who are actually good at PvP
---
In category #2, it's all about spell batching. It matters A LOT to PvP.
---
I use the naga and surprisingly it fits perfectly for my freakish hands
---
That’s right, you heard me correctly. Original female trolls. One more time, original female trolls. You heard it here first folks. We’ll have in depth discussion on how female trolls looked in vanilla wow and how I theorize they will look in wow classic.
---
I'll have to see if I still have my old hard drive from my 06 build - might be lurking around in a box somewhere.
---
Check out this thread for more info: https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/3iyvxv/found_an_old_copy_of_cheekys_hunter_dps/
---
You're not understanding. The subscription transfers over,  so say I get a token in retail go to classic and be like 300g for token. They trade me 300g on classic and I give them a token on retail. They use token in retail and then they have a subscription that covers classic.
---
Secretly yes. Reality AV would make a great stand alone game
---
Touche - my memory is failing me these days...
---
ok, what is your game development experience?
---
I disagree with the title and I'm not going to read this whole post because I think it's predicated on false notions. 
---
Dks didn't kill wpvp, bgs did. Back in '04, all wpvp was pretty much considered griefing in the mmo scene unless you were just dueling. So this change was only one of the features of the game intended to reduce griefing. The short era where ppl we're ranking through world pvp was ended when ppl could now queue into battlegrounds. And so if you don't care about your rank and you want to grief then go ahead while rankers are spamming bgs. Seems like a good way to go to me. Maybe if they have the same period in classic between pvp rewards and bgs release, dks could have a time not existing but otherwise, they are good.
---
Where is our boy Zug?!
---
Raided with Risen from BWL on farm through pre 4H Naxx.
---
Fail was a successful GM and his leadership method got results.  I think a lot of the animosity towards them was a mixture of success &amp; the way the guild was formed.
---
Early on they poached max level players from guilds to create a core group that could raid MC without merging with other guilds.  I was on Horde at the time, but that poisoned the well with a lot of people.  Didn't deter most though, because if you wanted to raid bleeding edge, you app'd to Risen.  If you washed out, you joined Surreal.

---
one very important thing i learned is if you want to have fun playing, play what you want not what others need.
---
Up until blizzard killed Hunter for me i exclusively from Vanilla till cata played Survival Hunter. I was out DPSing alot of socalled top DPS classes. Long story short being good at what is fun for you might be better then being OK a what is best 
---
I would not deny that.
---
But I think you and I both know that the Classic community would completely melt down if you took away battlegrounds. Our only hope is that people acknowledge how much world pvp died in Phase 3 or whenever the BGs are released.
---
The matter of severity depends on the server, but I did already acknowledge its effect.   
---
Reduce, but not kill.
---
But irrelevant
---
I only care about whats good in PvP though, so I think you misunderstood my post. What is good in PvE I dont care about at all, content is super easy and cleared 15 years ago, I have no interest in "topping the meters"
---
Thanks for the insight - poaching was pretty common place back then, right?
---
Yes, it is a true suggestion.
---
That's not a conspiracy theory, its *exactly* what you said with slightly more speculation, none of which is outlandish. 
---
I think there was a poll saying something like 70% of ppl on this sub that answered didn't have a sub. So there's a lot me personally and my gf will be resubbing just for classic
---
&gt; And what is wrong with asking for advice when choosing either WHAT I WANT TO PLAY(Not so strong in PvP) vs WHAT IS GOOD(Orc Warlock is really strong in PvP)?  
---
Because you answer your own question while asking the question you donut.  
---
&gt; Why wouldnt I get it for Ret as a Healer if It is a Ret weapon and I have used thousands of gold to prepare the mats?  
---
You don't understand how raiding works/is most likely going to work.  
---
Also, I'm not saying you wont be able to get enough gold for the mats, however, chances are that by the time you, there will be better weapons available.  
---
Also, if you somehow manage to get enough gold for the mats, and people who will let you have The Eye, its possible that it just won't drop. It took me about 2 years to get mine to drop on retail.  
---
BTW, GL with all that pvp you'll be doing while aoe farming lashers in DME. Generous 50g/hour on private servers is doable with /camp being available, which will most likely not be in Classic... do the math.
---
&gt;i don’t like your title and I’m not gonna read it, but anyways here is my opinion on the title. Hahaha
---
Also DKs where released alongside BGs so no one can say for sure. But dks where a deterrent no matter how you look at it.
---
well then u found your answer.
---
I dunno man, Bungie managed to get out, why not Blizz?
---
No, changes would refer to stuff that never was in Vanilla. 
---
DKs were both, and was not in vanilla. 
---
Can I join your marriage?
---
A deterrent to raiding cities but not to killing out in the world, where the real wpvp fun is. 
---
Interesting! 
---
I played along with RPers as if I was in character, but didn't engage in it myself. While I wasn't a 'serious' RPer, I enjoyed giving my orc a silly personality, which kinda stemmed from his engineering...same with my gnome warlock; it's much easier to be RP-silly as a gnome.   
---
Agreed with the community feel, though....and RP world-PvP guilds. Literally the only place they make sense, and they can be fun (as I hope they don't kill me too many times....)
---
And grouping is a huge part of vanilla, where do you think the group goes after a couple 5 vs 1s or 5 vs 2s
---
I'd say yes.  Guilds used to make joint runs and it caused a ton of drama regarding loot.  The pinnacle of a fledgling guild was to field 35+ in house raiders to secure all the drops/recipes/etc.
---
On horde, it was common for guilds to raid together for the weekly lockout but require multiple guilds to fill a raid.  This would go on for months and eventually cause drama.  Poaching right off the bat is the equivalent of ripping the bandage off at once and dealing with the fallout.
---
For Risen that backlash lasted a few years.  Was worth it I imagine though.
---
Everybody knew me as the druid without mount. My guild even gifted me the gold to buy my epic mount still didn't ride it. In the end I had a personal lock who ported me all the time. Funny thing is it didn't really hit me till I rerolled on another server. Most of the players from Un'goro (Eu) went to Destromath with Wotlk and so did I. Had the same nick there and the first thing I was asked when I joined a good raiding guild was if I learned how to ride. 
---
look at mr chad thundercock the druid over here
---
Ok so you have to play around there being safe(er) and unsafe territory. Is that bad in an RPG?
---
Imo add Draenai for alliance,  but use the old model so alliance has an ugly race. They're from swamp of sorrows, and they don't have a capital so they start in the human zone, like gnomes.
---
I loved doing Molten Core because I was one of the only leatherworkers who (a): had skinning and (b) had finkle's skinner. I also had a pair of gloves with +5 skinning which I would put on for good luck. After a while, the guild just didnt even bother asking me for the core leather, so I just kept them more often than not.
---
I cant do this anymore. Talking to people in this reddit is giving my brain cancer. I gotta delete this bookmark before I fucking die.
---
Half of vanilla didn’t have dhks. So it’s authentic, especially with progressive content stages.
---
Ive really got my hopes up for classic. I havent been this excited for anything in quite a long time.   Heres hoping classic servers will be around for years to come.   
---
haHAA, nice joke, I wonder what gave you that idea. 
---
BC would be the perfect version of the game if it wasnt for arenas and flying. Everything else was just a step up from vanilla. Unfortunately these two things also messed up some of the best parts of the game.
---
Addons
---
This is what add-ons are for. If you want them, you download them. If you don't, you don't.
---
Except people still did even after DHKs were implemented.
---
Griefers, *by definition,* aren't concerned with mechanical incentives or penalties. Because the whole point of engaging in such behavior is external to mechanical concerns in the first place.
---
Mana battery? VT didn't return mana till tbc, unless your talking about something else.
---
Probably the main argument against changing them is because the same solution will be present for each of these as it was in vanilla, just like how no one is arguing for a built in damage meter or threat meter or different SCT fonts. Addons will be be developed in beta and be readily available that cover all this and more the day Classic releases so why get hung up on whether blizzard does it or the community. 
---
But I understand that for some of you... your favourite flavour... ... ... is vanilla.
---
Yeah but pve realms aren't my style, might just suck it up and make a cow 
---
But Blizz has made it clear, time and time again, that authenticity is their #1 goal. And when faced with a decision, like AV, they go with the 1.12 version.
---
Honor without DK existed for only 2 months in the 25-month life of Vanilla. They were clearly added immediately after the Honor patch to fix a problem and remained in the game all the way until the TBC patch.
---
There's no way Blizz is going to suddenly reverse their decision-making process and restore NPC griefing to create a non-Vanilla type of honor grind.
---
Hell yeah, I'd be all about that!
---
Theres some recent theorycraft that actually suggests ferals are viable tanks from the start ( check out skarm's videos), it's one of the reasons why I wanna play it
---
That's already an option in retail, I assume it will be the same in Classic 
---
It's easy as in everyone knows what to do. But you still have to do it. Of course, vanilla raiding is much more about preparation than mechanics compared to mythic raiding bfa but you still need to get your buffs and do your gearing homework in order to perform the best. And sure u can get by with taking it easy but the fun of the game isn't just barely getting by, it's ABSOLUTELY DOMINATING THAT FIRE ELEMENTAL FUCK, DRAGON BOI AND THE SCOURGE INFESTATION. FOR THE [FACTION]. 
---
Sorry to say, but the mana battery thing (Vamperic Touch) came in TBC.
---
I'm right with you though, I want to shadow priest for all things as I had a warlock and shadow priest back in vanilla.
---
Oh you are the best!
---
It's a proposed solution, not Blizzard's stated solution. I'm all in favor of it, though.
---
The honor system didn't exist until patch 1.4. 
---
Two months later, Blizz added DKs in patch 1.5. They stayed until the TBC patch.
---
So just to be clear:
---
* 20% of Vanilla - no honor system at all (no HKs or DKs)
---
 
---
* 8% of Vanilla - honor system with no DKs
---
* 72% of Vanilla - honor system with DKs.
---
To ask for "Honor system with no DKs" is asking for the LEAST Vanilla-like version of the Honor system.
---
You are confusing why people want this in the thread. Most are not defending the removal of dhks so they ranking is easier, just want removal of wpvp discouragement.
---
Aye I’m fine with updated graphics on top of the classic mechanics myself as well. I’m more interested in how the community aspect works out than the way it looks anyway.
---
racials are so overrated, play the race you enjoy. They all have their pros and cons. 
---
Honestly, the obsession with BiS race here is retarded.
---
Playing games like this has probably helped us be frugal in other parts of our lives. It's hard to justify spending 100$ on a night out when stuff like Netflix and retail WoW is like 50c a day xD  
---
    
---
Okay, then there's 0 reason to use sharding during the AQ launch
---
I never saved the cases, but I saved the cards themselves for a long time :p
---
No reason except the same reason they want it for launch. "Too many people, too few of everything".
---
I, and many others, cannot trust Blizzard won't choose to utilize sharding in situations like that, or even just to "smooth out the leveling experience"
---
DKs where only in vanilla for a little more than a year. So about 40% didn’t have DKs 
---
I'm going to be a druid and I am going to respec. A lot. But it's ok cause I work from home and can farm gold pretty much 24/7. 
---
Half of those warriors won't make it to 60 and half of the ones that do won't make it to raiding.
---
Holy nostalgia trip. I played on Alleria in vanilla, so seeing all those guild names again is really freaking cool.
---
Funny I was just looking up AQ opening progress site on the way back machine.
---
Thanks for posting, op! Many thanks for reliving the time Lente, the human warrior, roamed Azeroth in &lt;Thunder Hammer&gt;
---
i think i recall reading that some of the numbers on boss abilities in og naxx were within about 10-20% of their values in wrath...  not sure about the validity though
---
Didn't know. Thanks.
---
Viable raid tanks? Interesting.
---
Damn, I was just sold on elemental shammy as my alt and now I'm back to reconsidering.
---
Fair point, now that I think about it anyone who races to 60 has free farming areas anyways
---
At what point in my response did I say Nost was the only private server.  
---
I really do believe that if Nostalrius didn't happen, Classic probably wouldn't be happening right now.
---
that gold in no way shape or form affects the classic wow economy, though...
---
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA. AAAAAAAAAAAAAA. 
---
One of my goals/dreams in Classic is to down every Alliance faction leader (even the ones not tagged as such) in one day. It's going to take a hell of a lot of doing if it's even feasible in the first place, but I *really* want to make it happen if I can.
---
If DHKs remain in that will basically be impossible. City raids all but vanished from the game following the introduction of DHKs, and world PvP in general became a pale shadow of its former self. It may have limped on until the introduction of flight finally pulled the plug on the life support machine it was strapped into, but most of the joy and life went out of it after 1.5.
---
Personally, I think Blizzard should just scrap the old ranking system altogether and come up with something new, but removing DHKs would at least allow the world PvP scene to flourish again.
---
Watch skarm's videos first and see how you feel, he breaks down the spec pretty realistically 
---
I believe it's a flagged gnome behind the orc. That orc looks like an NPC of the Kor'Kron guard from Thralls room in Orgrimmar. Not to mention there's a row of similar looking orcs, all without names above their heads. 
---
The orb of deception always gave you the appearance of the same set of gear, regardless of what you were wearing. So a male human using the orb of deception would have herods shoulder, the helm from herod, and a true silver breastplate. 
---
Their*
---
360$ is tantamount to 6-10 AAA titles, most of which don't have the replayability of something like diablo 2 or skyrim. If you played WoW for 1 hour a day during those two years it would have cost you 50c a day, 25c if 2 hours etc.  
---
Most AAA games these days last me like 10 hours at most, which makes them around 6$/hr, which is pretty terrible. Even at 20 or 30 hours, still a bad investment by comparison.
---
I'm okay going the pug route because I really just want to be able to do MC, ZG, and maybe AQ cuz I never did that. In my mind, Naxx is far out of the question.
---
&gt; It recently came out that Blizzard had started working on this before they send the CnD to the Nost team.  
---
Do you find it difficult to read?
---
Man that was so perfect, I had NO IDEA where the ice cream talk was going, until that word flew from his mouthhole into my earhole
---
I play to raid through and clear naxx and farm it after. But I want to do so in a spec/role that will also allow me to not be low priority on accessing the gear that will be good for me in pvp, specifically because I will be raiding as opposed to ranking up for rank 12-14 gear. What’s wrong with that?
---
I may end up doing the same. By no means was I referring to only being a tank. I plan on DPSing as well, especially leveling up. I know i wont be MT, but i would like an OT spot once in a while. 
---
I'd prefer there be at least two such servers in every region so folks can play both factions, but I'm willing to settle on just one to start. I genuinely believe the folks at Blizzard will be thoroughly surprised by how popular a choice it is, provided we have it as an option upfront.
---
Genius introduction.
---

---
Not mine, just something cool some dude from the community did.
---
Genuinely curious. How did arenas negatively affect WoW? 
---
I totally agree about flying.
---
This is the ideal female body. You may not like it but this is what peak performance looks like.

All other graphic options are maximized.
---
Also check out shedothedruid, he theorycrafted feral dps to the point where it's reasonably competitive . Feral is actually a very good and flexible spec
---
Retail will go it's own course because blizzard will keep their captive audience in classic while trying to appeal to the "other kind" of customer with retail. Maybe they will eventually release classic tbc and maybe retail will adopt a FEW design philosophies but overall it's probably going to be a minimal effect because retail's designers want to make their game and are stubborn in their vision, hence why azerite armor crashed and burned instead of just being scrapped immediately. 
---
For one, they eventually warped the class balance, leading to the homogenous soup we have today. But they were also a major factor for balancing during the time  because "esports". 
---
*Gnome /train intensifies*
---
&gt; Killing low level NPCs, quest givers
---
Here's a crazy idea, make them unattackable.
---
Through levelling - easily enough. You don’t have to nor should you necessarily go prot for levelling while tanking your dungeons. 
---
Make no mistake, you would perform better and make life easier on the healer with some prot points, but that becomes more relevant later on. You should be able to pick up tank gear without competition just by tanking, so it will feed itself.
---
While fury tanking is popular, I would honestly recommend prot at fresh 60 if you mean to spam dungeons and farm your prebis efficiently. It really makes up for your lack of mitigation in greens and blues, and defiance+1handed spec generates more threat than fury when you don’t have much hit gear.
---
Same could be said for mob target health, for simple party frames, etc. I'm not asking for WotlK style interface, but some things being given the option- it's just a win win. Why necessitate 99% of competitive players to download through a 3rd party website when it's easily, and much more smoothly, integrated. 
---

&gt; I was so addicted in college that I justified the 15 dollars as a smart investment.
---
Asa far as entertainment goes, 15$ for a month is a damn good deal.
---
My hopes are going up little by little, this is such amazing news really.  
---
I was worried they might decide against it because they spoke about "Blizzard standard quality" which implied to me they'd try to create a fluent, "lagless" gameplay experience, which spell batching doesn't really deliver in a way.  
---
  
---
However, spell batching is so crucial to the vanilla experience and I'm so glad they chose to implement it. I was one of the most critical people but seeing this implemented gets my hopes up.
---
Thank you!
---
and classes have neither a cone of vision - nor are they allowed to move around when rogues are on the server - right?
---
Not to mention that we were talking about typical BG setups. Last time I checked battlegrounds were still fairly linear. But then again who knows what private server bollocks people may be used to these days
---
Yeah, I've seen some of his stuff. Powershifting is really cool and I was really surprised about his suggestion to farm Gnomer for Manual Crowd Pummeler. 
---
I think I'm back to the shammy because I'm a little unlikely to be much of a raider and if I do, it'll just be on the holy priest main. That said, I have spent a lot of time as a druid, so I'm going to hit up the elemental shammy for dungeons and PvP.
---
To go off of this idea, what about Blizzard creating it's own "Addon Pack" that players can opt in, selecting Blizzard-Made "addons" to port into their client. Ones with easy quality of life changes like the ones I've mentioned. Seems like a win/win for both sides. 
---
Sneaking into Caverns of Time
---
You mean you are given them a shoutout to all the money they made with their 'hard work' stealing blizzards property?
---
bur
---
I leveled a hunter on a pserver, they are without a doubt one of the least satisfying PvE classes in the game, they have some cool gimmicks and arguably the best class quest, but in the end just feel weak as a dps class that does poor dps. 
---
Human warrior, undead rogue, undead mage, orc warrior, undead priest are up there 
---
I've only leveled a priest so my only insight is there. You go disc until 40, then switch to Shadow. 1-40, you better have a good wand cause that's all you do, shield yourself, maybe dot, and wand down. Get the talent that gives you Mana regen after a last hit. Respec at 40
---
For a shaman, I think you are supposed to go enhanc, one handed with a shield. They heal fairly well AFAIK, totems are irreplaceable. 
---
Druid you go feral and toast stuff, they are fairly good and can heal even with feral gear so you can group with people.
---
In terms of speed for leveling, I think it's: Druid &gt; Shaman &gt; Priest
---
In terms of overall healing, I think it's: Priest &gt; Druid &gt; Shaman but shaman and druid are semi close. No one holds a candle to priest late game healing.  
---
Anyone is welcome to correct me
---
Because it's just as easy to install an add-on. You could talk about this all day but they are recreating the base game of world of Warcraft, there will be mods for those who want them. If you're considering yourself as a competitive player then you should know how easy it is to install a mod. But I see what you're saying, I just don't think it should be forced on other players especially if they want a true vanilla experience.
---
Do you know if I’m able to twink at 49 for a bit in order to collect honour points and the bg marks (?) so that when I ding 60 I have a lot of honour. I think 49 bracket is limited to rank 9 gear so I would have to work my way up to 10. When I move into the 60 bracket do I lose all my honour and ranks?
---
you clearly have no idea what these events are. Launch is a problem because everyone is trying to do quests and it's too packed, the AQ event is the opposite. The entire server is fighting together to fight raid mobs or just grouping up, skipping the mobs and heading into the raids. 
---
Ah yeah your probably right. The name plate is off center from the orc anyway. That or someone playing with noggenfogger. 
---
Hmm I feel like I remeber the healers having a conniption fit about having a Mana battery on Loatheb. Guess I'm mistaken.
---
Agreed, shouldn't be forced. I've since thought about it and think blizz should just offer a side 'package' of simple addons like mob health, cc, coordinates, ones that are *clearly* beneficial for 99% of players regardless of playstyle and immersion (i.e, not including quest helper etc that breaks immersion)
---
You need to play WoW for like less than 10 minutes a day for it to be a worse deal than most of the deep AAA titles with lots of replayability that come out these days. Not counting the outliers like diablo, skyrim, fallout etc. that have huge replayability for single transaction games.  
---
I think expecting a bigger bang for your buck on a game in which one can easily sink in tens of hours a week is ridiculous. It's entitlement at its foundation :p
---
Better than a $100 bar tab...for one night. 
---
among a raid of 40 people less than 3 will give a flip about honor. been that will, will be that way again
---
not to mention that the ''diehard pvp only'' people will die out the moment guilds start to farm aq40 when they get roflstomped by pve gear
---
You should definitely play the class you want. You can always start an alt.
---
The chance of any guild letting you get it are low. Not saying you should give up, but it's the truth. I played a Rogue in Vanilla and had dreams of getting Thunderfury myself.
---
I never understood that argument.
---
Let's say you play only for 30 hours a month. Aka less than an hour per day. ,50 for an hour of entertainment is chicken feed cheap
---
and let's be real about it. Not a single person who has played back in the day - and who is constantly refreshing this reddit - played only one hour per day
---
It's from the TBC pre-patch, aka 2.0.1. The expac hadn't launched but the patch was there. You have a Tree of Life in your raid (and even in your group), that was obviously not in any 1.x patches.
---
Hmm, the entire server in one zone huh? Sounds a lot like "too many people in one area", but no, that can't possibly be what I was talking about, no way /s
---
This is not an issue - trolls will be trolls, and if suspensions/bans works like it did in Vanilla, you could get suspended or banned for unnecessary reporting.  
---
In short, play nice, don't be rude, show some respect for humanity and there literally ceases to be an issue.
---
doesnt really matter to the point i was trying to make ... its super cringe and 40 warriors "heroically" dying to the same boss over and over again doesnt really fit my image of a legendary wow bossfight ... thats exactly what this video conveys to me.
---
People used to raid naxx during tbc as well, maybe thats what you're thinking of.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b4wz4u/distribution_of_race_and_class_according_to/
---
...but in a good way - forces people to be mindful of what they say.
---
I raided with him in Premonition (Surreal+Titan merged) in TBC onwards. He ended up quitting WoW after the first tier of Cataclysm, I assume to focus on his studies since he was in med school.
---
Adversity is a form of content all its own, having everything come easy isn't fun and doesn't feel as rewarding. Also at least you even had someone to lend you 5k gold, you sure your warrior wasn't rocking some silk slippers too?
---
Retails designers have been morons for the last several years, not even hiding the skinner box mechanics with a fun class fantasy.  Grind your farm.  Grind you garrison.  Grind your artifact weapon.  Grind your factions and azerite, and every expansion everything you did gets thrown away so they can try again with the next stupid grind.
---
There’s no room for emergent gameplay because every move you make is planned, charted, and conceived before you make it, all with the intent of keeping you subbed.  
---
The classic team understands what fun is!
---
Only "devastating" to people without class. People making false reports will get banned or suspended eventually, meaning karma will win out and nice people won't have to worry about others trying to ruin the game for the sake of being a nasty person.
---
what created god? what gave it a 3 letter name? what defined the boundaries in which god made the universe? 
---
Was wondering about this myself, glad to see we'll have the options for this. I also like the newer graphics but that water..ugh
---
Assuming half of the voters for faction mutual classes go horde, this poll indicates 17.1% of horde will be shaman
---
Jeez you must live under a rock. They didn’t make any money from the server.
---
&gt;so classic could theoretically drop in less than 90 days.
---
The fact that they haven't announced a release date should probably tell you it's not out in 90 days
---
2.5k caps, paid server transfers, faction changes, race changes.
---
Unless you are tanking, a decent guild/raid leader is going to let you know what they expect resistance wise from everyone, or you can just ask. But as others have said, before AQ you really don't need much resist gear unless you are a tank.
---
BC was the best version of wow
---
Rest in Piece, Scriptcraft. I miss you.
---
Although to the dev that told me Lucifron doesn't patrol all the way to the back of the cave, you're still dumb and wrong.
---
I was terrible at PvP, but I would still Shadowmeld near the flag, Psychic Scream the rogue capping the flag away, DoT the rogue up, and then die to the rogue and he would get away with the flag anyway, because again I was (and really still am) terrible at PvP and proper sentence length.
---
Lol ret sucks for pvplol
---
Priest is probably the most involved pure healing experience in the game, they have many more tools in their kit that is directly related to healing. Paladins are absurdly efficient healers, but are limited to single target, and have few spells that are directly dedicated to healing. Paladin utility is godly with buffs and powerful cooldowns like freedom/bop.
---
For pvp, paladins are capable of playing a more hybrid playstyle, where you can either deal damage or throw out heals/buffs when needed. For priest, you need to pick either healing or damage. 
---
Im personally not a fan of druid as a pure healer, I enjoy their hybrid playstyle more in pvp.
---
I dont know where you're getting this info from but k1 and k3 definitely have spell batching. 
---
Like youd ever get a shaman and a pala in the same raid, exept for that, spotless.
---
Just say this prayer twice daily! 
---
Our lord who art in RP - PvP, hallowed be thy name. Thy realmdom come. Thy ICC be done, in game as it is in discord. Give us this day our weekly blue post, and forgive us our complaining, as we forgive those who argue changes with us, and lead us not into regular PvP realms, but deliver us from perma-OOC.
---
Blizz Pls.
---
I honestly never liked the introduction of resilience, though I understand that a lot of people loved it. To me, it felt like it split up primarily PvE players from primarily PvP players (and those parts of the game as a whole) too much
---
Fuck I hope we get an option to play classic TBC.
---
In a perfect world we could copy a character over from Classic and start as them in TBC classic.
---
Gives us the best of both worlds. 
---
How naive can people be to think that pservers were never used to make money and all the work to establish them - and to keep them running - was done hours for hours days for days just fuelled by love and thin air
---
Leather almost never really soars in price. Except devilsaur leather, and that will be a hotly contested farm I'm sure. Most people recommend just strait up vendoring early game leather stacks for gold. You can sell the later game stacks for gold, but it's not really a huge money maker. It's more like getting cloth off humanoids in terms of return, except you get a bit more, a bit more reliably.
---
But what im saying is that tbc hadnt launched yet.  I wasnt gaining xp in MC.
---
I play world of Warcraft from time to time
---
This is sad
---
Well through the glory of God all things are possible, so go ahead and jot that down in your little notebook
---
blizzard said they most likely will only do pvp pve and a few rp pve servers. people seem to be fussing about it though and saying that if they must pick one then theyd prefer rp pvp
---
Getting 40 people going in the right direction and having a tank who generates good threat it 90% or vanilla raiding. The real "mechanics" are rarely boss specific :P
---
Show me where to donate to nost or where I could.
---
Holy shit did I write the post? I feel like I am with you literally word for word with the exception of two toons. I’ll be lucky to get the time for the one. Man, let me know what you decide. I would LOVE to reprise my role as a warrior tank but it just doesn’t feel realistic to do much other than 5-man and MC. Dabble in BWL/ZG, which is more or less what I did the first time around as well, despite the marked lack of real responsibilities. 
---
And considering you don't take more than 2 hunters in your average raid encounter, it's not gonna have much uptime.
---
I need to do that for my undead mage so I don’t look homeless 
---
I think the first two weeks at least, but then as players re-launch with new toons, reach max level after a month and start their alts, or other such build-up, the first two months will be absolutely miserable to start without some way to alleviate the over-population in beginning zones. After that, it's probably just a "wait and see" until beginning zone usage drops to acceptable minimums to be playable without it.
---
Female dwarf. WHAT. ARE. THEY. 
---
DKs were added in 1.5... June 2005
---
DKs were removed in 2.01... Dec 2006
---
18 months.... The Honor System only existed for 20 months, so 90% of the time that there was "Honor", there were DKs.
---
We should.  Blizzard has taken the time to actually take all the popular addons over the years and integrate them in to the base UI.  What the purists want is this bizarre reversion of everything to what they remember and what THEY think is ideal.  I never see any #nochangers saying the should unlock castspellbyname because they never used it back in the day because they were 12 and they didn’t know any better, and at the same time keep saying “no castsequence or focus or any of the updates from the 2.0 API” even though you could program all of that in Vanilla.  
---
Take all this stuff out so addon developers can put it back in!  It makes no sense.  #nochanges except AV, and whatever I personally think should be in place, like non-normalized hunter pets, and RP-PvP servers.  
---
Downvoted for truth.  This whole spell batching thing is dumb.  "Hey blizz can u maek it laggy and creaky like 2005??!""
---
The primary reason male dwarves drink so much.
---
Did that answer your question?
---
I wouldn't get your hopes up on "Blizzard" changing its colors. This ragtag team of Devs working on Classic WoW are afforded more flexibility than probably other profit driven high priority development projects. "Blizzard" doesn't think Classic WoW will be a profoundly huge success. They aren't anticipating hundreds of millions of dollars from this project. Which basically means, the higher up have less influence of whats going into Classic. [Thank God] So, I wouldn't get your hopes up Blizzard as a hole has changed much.
---
&gt; You are confusing why people want this in the thread
---
They are confusing world pvp with honor farming
---
I'm not playing because 1.12 is not much of a nostalgia trip.  
---
They don’t have to know that though. He just wants to know what the loot etiquette for that gear. Such as who gets prio on that first onslaught girdle. I’d assume the top dps warrior should deserve it, or the most dedicated/helpful member.

Plenty of private servers made money, and plenty of them took donations. Nostalrius wasn't one of them though. You are wrong here. But I don't blame you. Nostalrius was the literal 1% and they were the exception not the rule.
---
Those guys were bleeding money like fuck maintaining a staff and that server and its no surprise it took nothing more than a nudge for them to shut it down.
---
Probably not much. OSRS was highly successful as RS3 still tanked.
---
Psssht, there's a ceremony of jerking the circle going on right now.
---
Yep. I have a lot of respect for what they did for getting Classic made. They bled a lot of money during that time too keeping servers up.
---
There's nothing inherently wrong with a gear treadmill, grinding or pre-planning. The difference is it's not fun in retail and it doesn't feel rewarding. Activision-blizzard wants to shovel content onto your plate and make it fit in a gearing system devoid of rpg or social elements. That's the true folly. 
---
In skyrim, somehow I always end up playing a ranged stealther the oneshots with a bow ... 
---
Cloud servers are fully programmable, and will be far more capable of adjusting to load requests etc., making time zone differences more bearable, likely have less lag time, faster response rates, etc.  
---
The only reason to use old-school servers is to appease a minority group (albiet a very loud one) that does not understand the longevity a cloud-based server will provide a game like this. There is a lot of concern about handling dying servers, and merging users into a maneagble player base if/when users quit playing over time.  
---
All of this can easily be handled on a cloud server, with almost no end-user knowledge or difference of gameplay. They could even manage it to the point where it wouldn't even require downtime to install patches or reset bosses. (Not advisable, but possible).  
---
I get that people don't like new ideas, and they are afraid of the game being "different" - but you need ways to attract and sustain a player base in a world competing with other games that work very smoothly. So while I love the idea of "no-changes" - there have to be SOME adjustments made to entice new players to experience the thrills and spills of vanilla, but in a way that is relavant and enjoyable in the modern gaming industry.  
---
This is the balance Blizzard appears to be striking out for - make the game as close to vanilla as possible, but make it fun and enjoyable for EVERYONE.
---
I'm planning on doing a relaxed run, as well as reading quest logs, I didn't absorb any of the lore as a kid. 
---
Just a heads up, the armor for the Orc section didn’t appear on screen. 
---
yeah but nost was ultimately the best one
---
So if I wanted to play an Ele shaman for PVP, it wouldn’t be *good* until AQ40 gear? Learning to play a character with more situation abilities and skills really sounds fun, interesting and challenging, but why bother if you’re not going to rewarded for your increased skill level until nearly the end of the game? Genuinely curious
---
Makes more sense to just have a toggle in the configuration menu.  Don’t want to see mob health percentage?  Don’t turn it on.  
---
I don’t know why people are being obtuse on this.  Can’t use blizzard’s threat meter.  Have to go download one from a 3rd party, because that’s what we did 15 years ago!  Can’t have macros, because I didn’t figure out what they were until BC.  
---
You’re right. I don’t know why that happened that way, I just realized it myself and the Vegas file showed the images.. really weird. 
---
Are they that bad at farming gold? Surely about the same as Warrior, Paladin, Shaman, Druid, etc.
---
The only real standouts being Hunter and Mage.
---
Yeah, it’s just 3 items, so it’s not a huge issue. Just thought I’d let you know. 
---
CHARBS U WERE A HUNTER?
---
Eww
---
Cope. Most people demanding RP-PvP aren't even role players. 
---
I value your input. I was going to make dungeon route guides with skips and strategies as well, which would kind of fall in to what you’re saying. Unfortunately the nasally part is my voice, I sound better on my other microphone but it’s broken at the moment so this muffled microphone is about the best I have. But thank you for your feedback! I’ve taken all of this into consideration and I appreciate the time you put in to write this.
---
Let's be honest, most people demanding RP-PvP aren't even role players. They have this idea that RP-PvP will be less toxic which I believe to be true but that has nothing to do with role playing.
---
Shhhhhh... too many secrets!
---
I appreciate it!
---
And what I'm saying is that the screenshot was taken between the day 2.0.1 hit, December 5th 2006 and the day TBC launched, January 9th 2007. 
---
This was during the TBC pre-patch. This means that the TBC changes were live to the game but the Dark Portal hadn't opened yet, and the level cap wasn't raised yet either. That's what a pre-patch means.
---
Release date on april 1st
---
F***************ck blizzard why
---
i need a 100% date not a 50 50 =|
---
[The struggle is real](https://imgflip.com/i/2x8578), my friend
---
it was the least we could do. it was...the least \*proud tear\*
---
What's the point of playing a game if you can't be a little silly?
---
&gt; Can’t use blizzard’s threat meter
---
&gt; blizzard’s threat meter
---
What
---
In Vanilla, no. In TBC I was the Mercenary Paladin who organized premades of undergeared pugs for PVP rep farming.
---
The second I would log in I would start receiving tells asking if we’re doing PVP tonight. I felt bad for everyone once I got the PvP panther mount , the only reason I did any PVP af all lol 
---
did this back in the day on a hunter. with traps I could prevent anyone else from getting up and lived there for a good long while.
---
I disagree.  The point has been made several times to the devs “I feel like I’ve done everything” to which they coyly respond “oh, so you’re done grinding?” Knowing darn well they designed that grind to last for 3 more months until they finished the next content patch.  All the time-gating nonsense is a killer, because there is no focus on just having a fun sandbox to go play in with the latest toys.  
---
ACKTUAHALLY your homosexuality was decided at the time of the big bang, there's no turning back
---
Why were you miserable on your warrior the first go-round?
---
This is my most hated bug I've experienced in any game. I didn't log in my character anymore and ended up quitting until wrath was coming out.
---
So they want a casual pvp server. Where everyone \wave and \dance
---
This is nonsense.  DHKs didn't kill wPvP; there was plenty of wPvP to be found on my server all the way up until the end of Vanilla.  Here's the two things that *really* killed wPvP:
---
*  Flying.
---
*  Dungeon Finder.
---
Flying reduced opposite faction interaction in the world because you could just fly past people, and Dungeon Finder removed peoples' need to leave capital cities at all.  
---
Thankfully, neither of those two things will be in Classic.  
---
That was uncanny, I read that and heard his voice in my head. 
---
Might not be in the game any more because I haven’t played in years, but they used to have a percentage below a mob to show how much threat you had relative to whatever it was attacking.  It didn’t exist in Vanilla because back then you couldn’t query the server for how much threat the mob had on a particular target, so people wrote addons that logged combat data and estimated those numbers themselves.  Managing threat was such a critical component they added it to the base UI, and now people are saying they should take that out and make someone write a new addon to do things the old way.  It’s just really bizarre.
---
Same thing with mob HP.  You couldn’t request that number back in the day, so people wrote guesstimating addons.  It was eventually decided it wasn’t really important to hide that from players so they opened it up.  Now we’re saying “no, take that back.  Make some guy have to program a new one.”  It’s like people don’t just want Vanilla back, they want the meta back too. 
---
I think they said that won't be coming back =(
---
Video seems unavailable/cannot be viewed.
---
It’s not a nerf because this is how it was in vanilla though.... 
---
Yeah.. Husband, laborer, daddy, and only 1 real free night a week. Raids are gonna be interesting. I plan to roll warrior and lead some PUGs though so raiding can at least be on my terms!
---
Look man, that's unhealthy reasoning to apply to video games, and that reasoning is exactly why so many games are trying to "hook" you with extra quests and bullshit so you'll play longer but none of it has soul and it ends up ruining a video game. 
---
You can't judge replay-ability on a scale with how much you should pay. A flat 1 time fee would be great, but 15$ a month is absurd for a game. 
---
We already pay for internet, we're paying them for memory cards for our characters, which they wont let us have or we would file edit. So... they're forced to have our characters on servers and they make us pay for it like that makes sense and then people apologetic use replay-ability as some sort leverage as if that makes paying 15$ a month any less painful for a video game we can never even own.
---
...not sure if I should up-vote or down-vote here...
---
They were told they couldn’t have something, so now they’re demanding they get it.  Or people really hate retarded names.  
---
Well, its not too different from [Retail...](https://i.imgur.com/bp03sUX.jpg)
---
Yes, this is a dumb idea. I do t think i can top this. Let me try: how about a race-pvp-server. No horde vs alliance but race vs race. Night elf vs  dwarf vs human vs undead etc... in short, a free for all.
---
If you’re going to OT, you’re going to want to go 31/5/15. 5 for crit, and the 15 for Shield Spec, Toughness, 1 point in Imp Shield Block, 2 points in Imp Bloodrage, and 2 points in Imp Sunder. Consider putting points into Heroic Strike in the Arms tree, and when you’re tanking, save uprage with white hits, Anger Managment, and Bloodrage so you start fights with 70+ rage to get the initial threat needed. 
---
Is that any different than blizzard selling cards that may or may not be 1000g or 1g worth when you flip 'em? Granted, he didnt include a BoE epic or nothing, but still.
---
If you want to tank raids, I would not recommend this spec. 
---
D=

Gnomes get wrecked by dwarves because they have no healers.
---
That's a 10k pop realm... They are not rare there
---
prob cause they knew hes a streamer, not everyone likes them
---
This is the kind of high effort troll I hope to avoid in game. Well played though dank meme, I guess
---
What? Are you high? This is insanity. 
---
Everyone gets dotted up by a warlock who gets shanked by a warrior who gets stunned by a pali who gets one-shotted by literally everyone else - still bubblehearths back to SW
---
They didn't know about it, or they forgot. So now they have to make a video about it saying it's a good thing and "no changes" commitment. Otherwise if they don't seem like fountainheads of vanilla knowledge trust from viewers declines and they lose revenue. It's farcical.
---
Ok, they can be allies. The same with orcs and trolls because they share starting zones

You know, I gotta admit. Sometimes I'll come across a guy named Turdeater or something and I'll just be like, why? The name you choose to represent yourself, that you look at all the time is TURD EATER? Why
---
It's a rough ride. No way to self-sustain without some having fore-knowledge of the talent tree. Heavy gear dependence so you struggle without knowledge of where to find proper gear as you level. You name it. 
---
Where's the fun in that?
---
Tattoo shops. Like barbershops but waaay cooler. 
---
As someone that twinked level 1 on pservers, you can put Librams on your level 1.
---
Bungie was an acquisition, blizzard was a merger. 
---
I don't speak for everyone, but the names thing irks me.
---
I like RP. I like world PVP too. I don't want to have to choose one or the other. It's as simple as that.
---
Holy crap! I'm trying to figure out who you are. I raided with Risen from BWL and into TBC.
---
Were you there for the Twin Emps kill?
---
Beloved, will you join me in renewing our vows oops I meant subs. For WoW classic wait where are you going
---
You'll be okay in the sense of things, but they are super Mana hungry so you'll need more consumables to keep up. They still have excellent damage but again, are limited by their hp and mp pool. Later on you get enough stats to easily breeze through lots of classes in 1v1, and not go oom in BG play. 
---
Get a druid friend for innervate..
---
But yeah, it's the same situation for shadow priests. Strong in pvp, limited by Mana. Spell power + bigger Mana pools can add up to like 2 to 3x the damage output because you don't have to downranks spells because you need that earth shock Mana or that nature's swiftness healing wave. 
---
*laughs in blessing of kings*
---
Yea, Kameril &amp; Axen tanked them.  Most guilds used a lock, we just had 2 tanks.
---
Would you rather give them an extra class then? Orcs have shamans so they can heal. Gnomes are the only ones in disadvantage.
---
Yeah, those things were added way after Vanilla. If you want those things, too bad. We're getting Vanilla, warts and all, and the fact that Spell Batching is confirmed to be in the game is just proof that Blizzard is sticking to that design philosphy for Classic.
---
No, I'd rather they get wrecked by dwarves.
---
I agree.  I played on an RP realm and never really RP’d.  I just enjoyed not having to see Misterlister &lt;The Sister Fister&gt; hanging around the mailbox.
---
What if they stopped listening to retail complaints, with the full intention of re-launching the game and spinning off into a whole new timeline of events, erasing all of the current game altogether (especially the gd pandas)...
---
A boomkin ofc! Nothing will strike fear in the heart of the enemy like being able to show that nobody needs gear so you gave the legendary to a chicken.
---
&gt;For rogues it's depressing how much better the T3 is than the R13 PVP set - using the agility equivalence formula, the T3 is more than twice as good as R13 (981AEP vs 441AEP).
---
To be fair T3 is a 9-piece set while the PvP set is only 6-piece.  A more  accurate comparison would include the best PvP ring, belt, and bracers with the PvP set.  
---
Haha, ok. We are playing dumb ideas, so why not.
---
That's only half the story. The other half is how there's only 2 or 3 ranged weapon upgrade from epic quest bow. With bad RNG, you can go from MC to deep into Naxx with the same ranged rep.
---
I mained lock at release -&gt; quitting the day after pandas were announced and I never understood why people didn't value the class earlier. I know they were broken at the beginning (thanks for the soulstones/healthstones/summons but bye now *kicks from group*) but with some changes they were the my favorite. I rolled most of the other classes but nothing could thematically feed the need of my Undead Warlock. At one point I was basically drakedog (wew lad) without the scarf.

Anyway when TBC prepatch was out and Felguards were basically MS warriors and seduce/nuke still wasn't dead all the FoTM alt-makers finally swarmed the ship and the dream started dying. Q_Q
---
No changes.
---
I LOVED this aspect of PvP - made it so much more challenging, and tbh, seemed more natural/believable.  It also leveled the playing field between say, a super-computer user on broadband and someone playing on a laptop connected to a starbucks WiFi.
---
I was a broke college student. My school had a meal system where you paid for the number of meals you'd eat per semester but not the individual food items. You could burn a meal, eat as much as you wanted, but not take food out. You could also straight up pay for food if you were a visitor or whatever but it was stupid expensive. I deliberately chose a meal plan with a very small number of meals per day, enough to eat just once, twice on certain days, just to scrounge up some extra cash. I would skip dinners and breakfast and at noon go have lunch and eat so much fucking food. It wasn't so bad because I had a lot of beers with my friends for dinner.
---
Well take it how you like, i had a blast and it was vacation time well spent. One of my favourite gaming memories 
---
Nice - I get to vote this up twice!
---
Really good choices. I liked the music too, Honestly this got me super hyped to roll an alliance priest and do all this for the first time in literally a decade! (I got a human warlock to 39, then a mage to 60, and then I switched to a Tauren druid and never returned to the Alliance).

* Diablo style loot drops happen in WoW.
---
* Characters get 5 stat points they can allocate anywhere they want.
---
*  A new generic talent tree is added for everyone, which is the same for all classes, that has all armor and weapon types on it.  You can sacrifice a talent point from your build to pick up a weapon or armor type your class couldn't normally use.
---
* Gear has stat requirements now.
---
How much roughly does it cost? 
---
I’ll be perfectly content if we get castspellbyname, warts and all.  It’s just weird to see people demanding no single button macros when that state of WoW never existed, even in Vanilla.

it was patched out too early
---
Even in vanilla this was irregular enough that when it did happen it was funny for everyone
---
Yup. Vanilla, BC, and Wrath were amazing. I never played Cata, but tried, so sadly, with pandas. I mean... pandas!?!? Come on... it was HORRIBLE! I never went back again.
---
Music is the epitome of classic Wow!
---
Maybe an LFRP server where if you click the little eyeball it automatically groups you with people based on your preferred RP style.
---
Three modes:
---
- ERP
---
- Long winded exposition mode, it takes a little longer to explain that you want to do RFC, but it’s worth the payoff when they finally connect what you are talking about.
---
- RP-PVP where it’s mostly people just pretending to RP, but their characters are all silent killer types and mostly undead rogues.
---
This would be pretty cool, honestly.
---
hopefully it's fixed
---
They would do alright for the first month or so, and then slowly fall off and eventually be quite terrible. Dungeons are easy enough that it won't be a problem. 
---
Yes!! My husband and I played from the middle of vanilla through the very end of Cata. I quit the day before Pandaria released and he quit a few months before me. We were pretty casual in vanilla but did some serious raiding in BC and Wrath. I even got a server first kill in Cata (low pop RP server so it really wasn't that impressive) but lost interest not too long after that. Both of us have sworn repeatedly over the years that we'd never go back and yet as soon as they announced classic we both jumped on it! We've been watching a lot of classic videos and talking about it a bunch lately. So hyped, I can't wait to go through it with him all over again!!
---
I will attempt to suck the venom out
---
IMO the bond you create with your toon as you level will dissipate any aesthetic problems you initially had.
---
Glancing blows werent even in peoples minds unless you were top 100, people wanted B I G crits like in PvP videos so they just ap/agi/crit build.
---
Priest is a super reliable, somewhat boring leveler.  Most often you will put your first ten points into Wand Specialization and Spirit Tap, then go shadow to 40 when you can respec to take Shadow Form.  You can heal any leveling dungeon with this spec but will need to respec to heal max level 5/10 mans and obviously for raids.  They're great, versatile healers at 60 and you'll probably always feel useful.  Mind Control is an 11/10 troll spell on PvP realms, and the special racial Priest abilities are a nice touch of flavor.
---
Shaman can also be a super reliable, somewhat boring leveler.  If you go enhance with a fast one-hander and shield you'll take relatively little damage and do reliable damage.  You won't kill everything super quickly but you don't have a ton of downtime.  You can also go for a slow two-hander with Windfury if you want a more exciting leveling spec, where you're still mostly just auto-attacking and placing totems, but every once in a while, you blow your target up.  Feels bad when you have a double crit Windfury proc when the mob is already at 5-10% hp, though.  For healing at 60, if you use your totems properly, Shaman make really good support/group healers.  Reincarnation can be handy to save you a corpse run once an hour, and being able to hearth more than once per hour due to Astral Recall is great.
---
Druids level well.  They have really great mobility and having stealth can be very helpful on your way to 60.  Not a lot of downtime, you'll probably level as feral but still be able to heal dungeons while leveling, but not as easily or mana efficiently as a Shaman or Priest in my experience.  Also, hope you don't mind the Cat Form appearance.  It's pretty bad, IMO.  Healing at end game starts off pretty slowly for Druids, and using HoT spells isn't a flashy as a Priest or Shaman.  They do get Innervate to give a caster mana in combat and Rebirth being usable in combat is great, although it has a fairly long cool down.
---
Ahh memories. Fairly accurate if I remember correctly, lol.
---
Source: was Vanilla UD Priest. 
---
You forgot the ANELE KAPOW in twitch chat.
---
There's some really great conversation in that thread, and it really feels to me like it boils mainly down to Blizzard assuming they know exactly what's best for the game and the people in it - to the point they stopped listening to the players at all.
---
Glad the classic team is listening a bit more.

---
I'm no expert on the topic, but reading some of the comments around here sure makes me feel like one. Activision and Blizzard are the same company. Activision is Blizzard, Blizzard is Activision. They merged. Yes, there are "separate" subsidiaries named Activision and Blizzard, but in order to divorce the two, the parent company would have to either spin off Blizzard or some competitor with extremely deep pockets would have to purchase Blizzard or bits and pieces of its intellectual property. Neither scenario is likely, nor would either scenario have the desired outcome. Investors with deep pockets generally (read: always) like to see a substantial return on their investment. Bungie and Activision had a partnership on a much smaller scale - Destiny's IP is worth far less than Blizzard's main titles.
---
If any of our resident lawyers or bankers would like to chime in and correct me, I would be happy to stand corrected on any of the points above.
---
They haven’t come out and said it yet, but I imagine there will be no cash shop/WoW tokens in the beginning, and then it will slowly creep in as time goes on.  Or maybe they’ll take the opportunity to keep pristine servers pristine.  Lots more money to be made from 2 years of 15$ from a few million people than a 100k mounts sold at 60$.  
---
a
---
Because it's initially funny, and then you're stuck with it anyway :p Most of my characters have reasonable names, buuuut I do have a Shaman named Groganmaster
---
Yes but it also means the opposite, that a mage can hit you with a spell when you've already vanished.
---
Thank goodness retail isn't going anywhere then, eh?
---
I mean I wouldn’t complain about daily news, or hourly, or every 15 minutes... I might be a little too hyped... but blizzard has been listening so much to the community concerns that i feel like i’m dreaming.
---
It forced earlier reactions and awarded antipated commands wonderfully. Mages blinking before a warrior charged would leave a warrior standing alone, helpless in the spot the mage just left, unable to hamstring the mage, even if the mage was stunned for a brief second at the end of the blink.  
---
Side note: This hurt warriors some, and probably has a lot to do with why warriors are so popular on PServers, where batching isn't the same, and sometimes, a warrior's charge interrupts everything before the warrior even arrives at the end of his charge!  
---
These "glitchy" affects make Pserver experience vastly different from vanilla timing/pace control, which, if mastered, afforded a good player a lot of opportunities to force other players to make mistakes.  
---
For instance, a paladin could begin a heal, and move halfway through it, drawing a pummel/kick to interrupt. This has always been common practice, but imagine now a world where you can't wait until the very last possible second to interrupt a spell, knowing your interrupt may fail...  
---
This also hurts in PvE, where a tank may die even after a heal "lands" on him, but the boss's attack already filled that "batch" where the damage done exceeded the player health, meaning without a block/parry/dodge to mitigate the damage, the player dies.  
---
Side note: This is one reason why Druid tanks, or HoT's are viable in Pserver usage, but probably won't help as much in classic.  
---
And finally, this is one more thing that may force players to slow down and avoid "speed-runs" of instances. Since spells are moved down in priority, it may cause tanks to take melee damage received in a batch before a heal lands in that same batch. This was a HUGE part of what made tanking/healing difficult in vanilla. It'll be a subtle difference, but should be enough to change group dynamics.
---
&gt;Consider melee, warriors especially a no go.
---
It's only slightly annoying, but mostly fine as long as the ping is stable. I'm Australian, and I was playing WoW well before they had Oceanic servers physically located here. My first two 60's were Rogue and Warrior, and I performed just fine at around 230ms.
---
This. The serious rankers were never going to go raid orgrimmar with you before R13/14 anyways. The rest of people don't really give a shit about a few DKs.
---
There's an entire generation of online multiplayer gamers out there who grew up in an industry where game companies took a strict stance against cheating (essentially all the things you can buy in a cash shop online these days).
---
There has to be some game company out there, with some level of momentum/popularity that wants to bring this type of purity/integrity back to online multiplayer gaming. 
---
I'm telling you, whoever that game company is, they will be given tons of passionate/loyal support as a result of taking a stance against all the BS in online games these days.
---
There was this amazing troll on Malfurion named Magestain. He would always get banned for the dumbest reasons and always came back with a different variant of his name. Maigestain, Maygestain, Maygestayne. Some nights I would just jump around IF drinking beer and reading all the weird shit he said.
---
What the fuck did the Alliance do on this Server? How is is possible that a fucking Troll opens the Gates? Humans anyone? 
---
Yep!
---
That’s true.  I think I’m going to main a warrior this time around, but I’m going into it basically fresh.  I think with the flood of information about where to go and what weapons to aim for it won’t be too bad.  I think I got a warrior to about lvl 42 when WoW first released but I bailed on him for basically the same reasons.  
---
I also tried to level him sword and board using the prot tree since that’s what I was used to warriors being.  Didn’t know anything about the game.  Doubt I leveled cooking or even used first aid.  This time I feel much more prepared but I’ve forgotten enough that the journey will be exciting again.  I’ve leveled a couple warriors on private servers but I’ve been careful never go to much beyond lvl 20. 
---
There are a lot of “issues” with itemization in classic wow. Hunters are not the focus of those issues in the slightest. If they were to touch these items you would have every retadin, boomkin, enhance, feral, prot pally screaming for changes and they’d have a much better case to make. 
---
Hunters are T1 levelers, T1 farmers, T1 PvP group and wPvP, T1 dps in all raids but AQ and Naxx. Classes have pros and cons. The fact that hunters fall off late into the game is a fair balance after dominating for 90% of it. 
---
Rage quit after one wipe in a dungeon after pulling all the mobs.
---
#okaymaybeacouplechanges
---
Thanks, I hate it
---
*Totally Legal Magic sweet rolls*
---
Horde or ally?
---
Youre missing out on some crazy level 5 death matches now
---
It basically the same as intermittent dieting lol. It's actually good for you. Minus the beers haha
---
If you roll undead mage everyone is going to assume you are Chinese
---
Same - I feel I can do it much better and to top it off I'm going to use my Warlock for Alchemy, my priest for Cloth/Enchanting and my mage to Leatherworking/Mining so that they can all support the warrior. Will help out tremendously. 
---
I dont see the point if it other than to gank people mmo-larping, but is it really that hard for blizz to just relabel a pvp server rp?
---
I can verify this. I used to tank in vanilla, and we would always review the combat logs on wipe. Later in TBC, as I got more serious about it, I learned and could prove that all to often, a heal would land "before" a death-dealing blow that shouldn't have killed the tank, but did.  
---
It was very difficult to sort out, especially in fights with a lot of damaging components. Especially with the spell-priority being lower, however, you could eventually calculate out where "same time attacks" caused wipes even when heals were landing at the same time.  
---
This is one reason why HoTs weren't as useful for the MT, since you needed larger heals very often, but the HoT's/Chain heals were great for sustaining raid groups.
---
Keep up the great work frost, love the vids on classic whoa
---
According to the timeline(mentioned by ythisens) its entirely possible that classic was in the works before the nostalrius shutdown so its hard to say how much of an influence nostalrius had on fast-tracking the project.
---
But it really cant be understated the effort that went into the MANGoS project.
---
its also pretty disingenuous to suggest that other non-nostalrius private servers had no impact in the grand scheme of things, after all nostalrius took the lessons learned by past servers to learn what did and did not work to create the model that's still used now.
---
Nobody knows. All theories, including theism, are equally inadequate. Your arrogance is unbecoming.
---
I was there for that kill! I even healed Grogramon! I can still remember Nico saying "rogues out" over and over...
---
I'd prefer they simply trash retail and start a whole new timeline, going all the way back to Classic. Then prevent Cata, and do something else. Skip pandas altogether - that was nonsense.
---
You don't have to choose. We had plenty of world PVP on SWC(NA) RP server back in the day.
---
Before the peanut gallery comes after me.. I do think they should have a PVP-RP server.  I am just saying you can still have world PVP on a standard RP server.
---
Theres literally nothing in the PvP acronym that implies equal footing, willingness, objectives, or matches. As an acronym its meaning is a literal interpretation of the words that make up the acronym. In this case player versus player. That means any instance of one player killing another is PvP. It doesn't have to be honorable, it doesn't have to be fair, it doesn't even have to be fun for both parties. 
---
People don't know jack. Go ahead, don't pick hunters, while us hunters will have literally thousands of gold doing the most efficient farms.
---
Any half smart decent will give the loot to mages, anyway. "Casual" guilds are irrelevant, they'll do whatever and just have fun.
---
and yet people will STILL think they are doing it for money and will put in microtransactions or whatever. Fucking conspiracy nuts will never be pleased.
---
Whoa, that's getting into some advanced stuff there...  
---
Weren't the original hit boxes deemed "unfair" though? Such as with tauren, being able to strike them seemingly beyond where they could hit back, or gnomes being hard to target/strike?  
---
The other two I'm curious about, not sure I know enough about them to understand what you're asking for there - care to explain? =)
---
Oh yeah.
---
I was the leader and organizer of a level 19 twink guild, Blood, Bath, and Beyond. We spent hundreds of hours farming consumables and running our twinks through low end instances to get all our 10 players up and running. We planned it out meticulously. Each player had dozens of every useable consumable on hand (back then, you could stack both food and water buffs). Most of our group spent the gold to get top of the line enchants. 
---
To top it off, we planned our debut during my bachelor party, a 3 day long event at my new apartment that only contained a fridge, 2 huge tables and 10 computers. 
---
We played close to 300 games that weekend. We ended up winning in WSG.... every... single.... battle. The closest we came to defeat was against a rival twink guild and they capped the flag twice. 
---
After a while, most competing teams would just give up as they witnessed a level 19 warrior with 1700 health with a pocket healer devastate their front line. And our rogue with, not one but two life-steal enchants. It was a fun weekend.😃
---
After that, we never did an organized 10 man again since, at that point, it's not even fun anymore. 
---
Lol Ret doesn’t suck for pvp get that shit out 
---
I think your voice sounds fine. Good video but yes a little long. 
---
I grinded battlegrounds for many weeks to just to get the Commander mount at 80g, rather than try to accumulate 800g.
---
Cool story bro
---
If you want to prove it doesn't work then why don't you do it before you're done ranking? 
---
It makes WoW a skill game vs. the current keyboard-monkey-smash/drinkmorebeerandgetlewtz nonsense. With pandas. Seriously. Pandas? Lame lame lame lame lame! I hate pandas! (Not real ones - they're ok).
---
Thank you!!!! What timing, I was working on my character spreadsheet and names. None of them are on the reserved list!!
---
So small, and yet, this may be the BIGGEST change...
---
first time I've ever seen a community *happy* about lag between the server and the client
---
they are not 10x more common either
---
I'm sure I'm in the minority here, but I'd like to play classic wow using the same graphics that are on live. As others have mentioned, you'd be the only one benefiting from it so it's not game breaking. Personally, I think it's one of the only good things that have come out of wow from wrath onward...
---
It is related.
---
what i'm asking is if you spec into redoubt and shield specialization or avoid them because you are focused on higher damage using the 2h. And reckoning stacks reset when you switch weapons...
---
My first character in vanilla was a 51 human priest before I decided healing stupid tanks is no fun. If you want it done right you gotta do it yourself. 
---
However I will say this, gearing yourself up to be a main tank is a huge time commitment. It also means big repair bills. If you want to do any questing you may need to respec to something that doesn’t take forever to kill things and that’s expensive too. 
---
I would think so, but I'm not an expert - just hoping it will!
---
Just not always. 
---
My thoughts exactly! Well said. 
---
Always leave comments!
---
I understand where you're coming from, but don't forget at WoW's peak it had 12 million subs. That's $180,000,000 (180m) dollars revenue every *month*. Even at a measly 5 million subs - the lowest publicly recorded number - they're clearing $75m a month, or $900m annually, consistently, for 12+ years. These are not rookie numbers. Blizzard could, if it cared to, literally throw money at their problems until they disappeared.
---
So "it's cheaper to do it the unauthentic way" really isn't an excuse here.
---
there is near zero reason to play a druid in vanilla wow. "good at leveling and bad at everything else" is a pretty shit niche, and already filled by hunter.
---
This guy jinxed it
---
People latch on to the 1% of players that talk shit about classic, instead of realizing 90% of retail players are just like "i'll try it out" or "doesn't interest me". People hating classic is an extreme minority. 
---
DBM update when?
---
Indeed, but also very gear dependent!
---
These are the important reminder guides I will lose when I really need them later.  Good looks nice formatting
---
It feels bad. I got mine the hard way(and got super lucky). Then later they buffed the drop rate a ton and I saw them all over. I know ill never see one again, but I hope the people who do appreciate it, and how it means something again.
---
I will admit to this. I transferred to an RP-PVP sever back in the day with some friends. We ended up loving the server due to its maturity. People seemed less toxic than what we were used to, and even though we did not RP, we didn't interrupt or mess with anybody that was. (most people on the server did not RP). I was looking forward to rolling on a similar one for classic but oh well, PVP it is!
---
Not really.  I wouldn't think increased GM tickets of saltee gankees reporting names would be that much of a discouragement.  
---
Obviously rolling my beloved and awesome, badass Warlock... But I'm not happy about the fact of there seemingly massively growing popularity! I WANT IT ALL TO MYSELF
---
Funnily enough it probably wasn't even that bad what with furor in resto and omen of clarity and +10% dmg in balance right?
---
The intro was a brilliantly created nostalgic trip and the outro was unexpectedly hilarious.
---
Once you achieve world domination, what's left to achieve? 
---
My wifes rolling a warlock and planning to tailor, I dread the time I'll spend helping her farm these 
---
You call single target farming effecient LMAO you actually know nothing. Paladins and Mages have you beat by miles because they can actually AoE farm, unlike your wheelchair hunter ass. 
---
I’m gonna aaabsolutely love smashing my jump key before a Warrior charges at me, that shit was infuriating from a Warrior POV.
---
Depends if the put the honor system in at launch (I hope they do) or if they delay it by a few months. If it's in at launch, then you can PvP all you want on your way up to 60 and your rank will stay with you. Details are still up in the air on that though.
---
It's pretty well known that a warrior can level as Fury all the way to 60 but still tank any dungeon after slapping a shield on, sometimes not even needing the shield. But I know the commitment to MT, that's why i said i won't become it
---
Generally I would say modern graphics. If I had to be specific - druid forms. 
---
My hobby before wow was drag racing, I picked up wow as a cheap hobby. Just the fuel for the tow rig was over 100 for a Saturday of racing 2hrs away. These days I had to try harder to rationalize the game 🤣 does a 31 year old really need to play video games.
---
Dont forget  Soul Link !!!... soul stones, heathstones, pets = more damage or more cc , they can summon players , free 40 and 60 mount ( kinda lol ) . also death coil = best way to deal with UD rogues.
---
Because it punished you heavily
---
Not sure on a guide, but essentially it's a timing mechanism.  
---
If you learn to use it properly, it can maximize your ability to conserve mana as a healer, but carries with it the need to anticipate damage received, as damage received will land before a heal, if both are in the same batch, since spells are lower down on the priority list. This means waiting until a tank/player takes damage, but timing a heal to land before the next damaging strike. This reduces overhealing, but prevents a tank from taking damage at low health.  
---
As a tank, this means anticipating when a heal may come late, and using a CD/pot to survive an attack and make it to the next heal.  
---
In PvP, it means interrupting a spell before it goes off may not actually interrupt the spell, if the spell cast lands in the same batch as an interrupt. This means a player must interrupt earlier in the cast. This allows casters more power to "bait" interrupts by moving mid-spell, preventing lockouts from early interrupts. This "bait-and-switch" threat means that while players like rogues/warriors get to apply their damage before spells do in the same batch, it means that casters can force melee players to "waste" interrupts, possibly giving them a free heal or chance for separation.  
---
This also puts interrupts on a more even level, since melee players can't hammer away on a caster during a spell, waiting till the verrrrrrry last second, then interrupt and get another free 3 seconds to slam on them before the caster can do anything again.  
---
This also reduces last-second avoidance measures, like vanish before the end of a cast (gotta do it sooner), or bubble, iceblock etc. It reduces the effectiveness of the pally's "forever-stun" as an interrupt, meaning fewer times when you are simply dead if you don't have a CD or immunity.   
---
It means faster weapon-speed for melee actually makes more of a difference, but not so much for PvE where 99% of the fight is about pure damage output, and timing against damage received won't matter as much as say, vs. a mage/warlock in PvP.  
---
In short, this is a difference of milleseconds, but it completely alters the gameplay, opening up a whole new world of opportunities and dangers otherwise unaffected by modern games. THIS is what made vanilla so amazing, and one of the ONLY things Pservers have struggled so hard to replicate...  
---
Welcome to a wonderful new adventure my friend, you're gonna love it!
---
At the time flying was amazing.  Even in wrath flight was okay.  Only when the world was recreated to allow flying everywhere did things take a nosedive imo.
---
Essentially, yes. And it was wonderful. Mages wouldn't have survived PvP long without it.
---
Reclassify gnomes as critters.  Problem solved.
---
Most people are not voting based on min/maxing or a deeper knowledge of endgame.
---
I think it will. A major difference between retail and classic will be loyalty. Not "loyalty" as in, "I need to log in and do my chores.... um, I mean dailies." Or, "I've spent so much time with my character/guild I CAN'T just abandon him/her/it", a classic sunk-cost fallacy.
---
But classic players will have real loyalty, loyalty to an ideal, a way of life if you will. Throw around the word "nostalgia" all you like but I think the classic community, as a whole, are ultimately going to be  the better customers for blizzard because we play a game we LOVE. We will stick with this product, not because we are tricked into it and not because of a misplaced loyalty, but because we love the community, which is really what this game was built for. 
---
Think about how it began: you start, a lowly level 1, a NOBODY, and you are eventually tasked with saving the world. But not alone. It was impossible to do it alone. You needed the community to succeed. And the challenges continued becoming more and more difficult until, ultimately, we had Naxx, an insane challenge most never saw. 
---
But, as the game progressed, blizzard lost sight of that, until now, its essentially a single player game where you are an unstoppable, all powerful God, who needs nothing and no one. 
---
Resetting the clock, making us all nobodies again, forcing us to be a part of a community and therefore BUILDING a community, this will be the greatest breath of life blizzard will ever impart on the dying corpse of their once great game. 
---
There were no legal micro transactions in WoW during vanilla as far as I can remember so I think we should be safe for the time being. 
---
If by "working on" you mean a couple of guys were throwing ideas around trying to figure out a way to make it work.  Then yes.  It was being worked on.
---
General rule of thumb is that in vanilla, if you haven't pushed the interrupt by the mid-way point of the spell, it's already too late.
---
Customizable naked looks for female night elves and female humans. 😛
---
By the way, you're 100% wrong. It was just before Ely launch and the Nost team visiting, not before Nost shutdown - go watch the ClassiCast again and learn to get your references correct.
---
Why not for both money and enthusiasm then?
---
It’s good snu snu

It's like the tears of angels. Only better.

Yes

I thought they said they're blocking that

Felstriker
---
Most of these I don't care about, except for coordinates. That one actually changes gameplay and social interaction significantly, especially for those questing without third-part tools; if you're asking another player for directions or help finding a quest objective, there is a significant difference between receiving a vague description based off local landmarks, and being told "go to these coordinates." And while most players (in my experience) are fine and understanding of people not using mods, you won't find such acceptance if you're just refusing to use the tools the game itself gave you.
---
I had just started college when WoW came out and the reason why I didn't play for the first 1-2 years is because I could not afford it on a college kids budget. Even when I could buy the 60-cards (no credit card), it was every few months.
---
Ummmmm about that... =D
---
As someone who did it, even getting to 11 will make you want to kill yourself.  The prospect of continuing to 14 is too daunting at that point.
---
And aside from the gear which isn't that great, all you get is a weapon, which is a much smaller upgrade than going from regular to epic mount.  Plus, the weapon gets replaced in AQ40 or Naxx anyway, IIRC.
---
I find it very interesting to see the huge number of people looking to play warrior in all of these polls when they come up.
---
I vividly remember that the vast majority of characters across all servers rolled rogue and mage.  It will be interesting seeing how the population shapes up with the community knowing exactly "how" each class is going to turn out by the end game.
---
Turtle mount for the upper middle class folks 
---
Jeeze guys. Just find something else to do. It'll come when it comes. It'll still be there after it comes, you're not gonna miss anything.
---
That is a great duel! Awesome use of character spacing, weapon changing, stance adjustments... everything I loved about the vanilla warrior!
---
Actually it immediately reminded me of [this](https://imgur.com/a/GA8FV8C).
---
No, retail WoW is a terrible game. Thank goodness we have you to make this same comment for the millionth time on this sub though, eh?
---
Yes. Your gear can make up for spec as a healer. 
---
You're well on your way to some solid LOTR RP my friend!
---
All models and textures are from BFA, everything else is vanilla.
---
Ion
---
...unless you're the mage. This is definitely one of the things that hurt rogues - unless you learned to gouge-bait a blink.  
---
There are ways to use this to your advantage for nearly every class. Except druids. They get screwed. And warriors sorta get a raw deal. Rogues can still use several other tricks to avoid taking damage though, so having this aspect back in the game for classic makes it balanced again, imo.
---
Played from Vanilla-Cataclysm. Been on private servers back and forth since.
---
My girlfriend has no MMO experience at all, but she will start playing. Bought her a laptop and we got to level 24. 
---
Told the group for dungeons to be gentle with her, as in taking extra time and perhaps ninja pull.
---
At the end they cheered for her and said they were impressed, which made her more motivated.
---
Look up 'bluewalling'. Technically yes, you can engage in world PVP. It's just extremely unfair and immersion breaking most of the time. 
---
Your voice is fine.
---
In regards to length, I would suggest adding some time stamps to the description so viewers can quickly hop to the slot they are interested in referencing that second.  I actually like the detail you went in to since this information is so common, but usually gets just dropped as a list which may lack details like stats or where they drop.  Going over the numbers and offering insight is handy and much less sterile than similar presentations I've gone over.
---
I usually got the hunters who didnt know how to take their pet stance off aggressive.
---
Agreed. Also, much higher skill ceiling. 
---
Has blizzard even commented on this topic?
---
But you can't know if you were really faster, or if you just have less latency or better equipment. Smaller batching makes for smoother big-group events, wPvP groups/raids, and brings back some of the original rock-paper-scissors balance to the game.  
---
There is a sort of natural feel to the idea that even if I started first, someone else may be able to counteract with the same ability and match me perfectly. Or that even if someone tries to interrupt me, I may still somehow get the spell to go off.  
---
It's not "perfect" every time, and that is natural.  
---
Retail or Pserver batching is robottic. But that's just my 2 cents
---
But Classic is going to be 1.12 so why would 1.10 items not be in launch?
---
I'm just going to rp on the server I m on regardless if it's rp or not
---
My rationalization was a brand new game was ~$60. I paid for 6 months at a time which was I think $12/mo.
---
My rationale was I'd rather play this game than have a new game every 4 months.
---
"fair" in PvP fights is a ridiculous.  Its why I don't buy the whole "I play on a PvP server for the added danger".  That danger exists whether you are playing flagged on PvE or on a PvP server.  The only difference is on a PvP server you have the chance to attack first if you get the drop on someone.  There's never anything fair about it beyond what you build up in your own head.  
---
Porbably nitpicky, but the font on the thumbnail isn't ideal. I actually thought it said "Fliry Gecir Guioe" and assumed it was in another language. If it wasn't for the title I wouldn't have made the connection. The first few seconds after an impression are the most important. 
---
Inspired by true events on a private server just now.
---
F
---
Why is ronaldreagan on there?
---
Yes. 
---
Hardcore guilds would probably require deep Resto however.
---
That being said, Resto Shamans are so in demand that you could probably get away being 30/0/21 anyway.
---
This made me laugh lol. Actually pretty good representation 
---
Spell batching in retail is robotic, unimaginative and unnatural.  
---
Someone having a continuous advantage over everyone else because they live closer in proximity to a server is broken and frustrating.  
---
Someone having a continuous advantage over everyone else because they have a better system/connection is broken and frustrating.  
---
Oldschool vs. newschool, the old way was more natural. Yes it was frustrating at times, but at times, it gave you a win you never would've had otherwise. Now that was magical, and is something that was lost along the way to the newschool.  
---
So you can have newschool all you want, with all your expensive, overpriced equipment and fancy mods. I'll take the magic and fun of oldschool nuances over the repetitive, boring newschool methods any day.  
---
Convince me otherwise... I don't think you can, good sir!
---
So happy to hear this. 
---
Batching and server ticks are two seperate things. The game shouldn't feel laggy, it will just allow a larger window for same-time affects to proc, meaning the priority list of physical effects &gt; spell effects will have a larger affect on results.
---
We don't yet know for sure if there will be progressive itemization or not.
---
this is activision/blizzard we're talking about .. does it really matter that there wasn't microtransactions in wow? 
---
The actual raids will be trivial unless they buff the raid significantly(Something they should considering how many nerfs raids got both in vanilla and TBC that weren't part of patch notes....) 
---
The time consuming time now will be gathering pre bis items(Unheard of back in vanilla) all the fucking consumables(Besides mana pots) pretty much foreign concept before late AQ/Naxx ect. Not to mention if world buffs stay the same as they are on private servers.
---
The time it takes to go get the DM buffs, then songflower, then long off and wait and be ready in Org for Ony head ect all that shit sucks up a lot of time.
---
But ignoring all that the most basic of guilds shouldn't spend more than 2 hours clearing Molten Core if its 1.12.1 values. 
---
So I doubt real life commitment and raiding will be a huge issue. After all most of us who actually did play and raid in vanilla are in the same situation. Sadly no longer 16 and able to play 18+ hours a day.
---
Saying that those shouldn't be toggled settings because there will be add-ons is a pretty backwards justification. Besides I don't think the 'spirit' of classic will be in recreating the original UI.
---
Considering the number of add-on developers that have fallen off over the years it's hard to imagine they'll be back for classic or juggling classic/retail versions of the same add-on.
---
Killing Razorgore for the first time felt like a huge achievement, right up until 3 minutes later when we got deep-dicked by the true gatekeeper, Vael.
---
It's not a difficult concept to understand, the more people at the AQ event the better the experience for most people, the more people at launch the worse the experience is for most people.
---
is there evidence of them not scaling?
---
i dont actually know and it doesnt seem to be something that was documented to much extent in of-era video capture
---
Noted...
---
Thanks for the reply! :)
---
Yo I played on Destromath from end of TBC to Mists, too bad the server got the big dead :( I hope they name a PvP server in Classic Destromath lol
---
&gt;boobpenis
---
Well i was replying to whoever said that its tbc.
---
yeah, years ago on feenix 1 a few of us sat down with the idea of a fire rogue and wanted to see what it could do on that server. i dont remember who the originator of the idea was. likely cysthen, but i cant tell you if he had any inspiration beforehand
---
they were absolutely shattering dps charts but i dont know what the end was since they never got to accumulate real full sets. floating around 2k seemed common with nightfall/scorch uptime though. it was brutal in warsong since they did about 1k dps straight through plate on their own right without much buff assistance
---
the rogue one should have been homer dissappearing into the bush
---
Hitler but no Genghis Khan or other big baddies.
---
From a min max point of view it used to be go straight to barrens, but I think now quest in silverpine till 15 then head to barrens. But honestly the early levels don't last long in the grand scheme of things so quest where you want
---
This isn't going to make it clunky. Server ticks/latency will still be the same. Batching (unaffected by latency) affects what things are allowed to happen at what time.  
---
Say for instance, that a batch occured every second. If you and another player execute a command in that same second, both commands are recognized and accepted by the system.  
---
Now, batching is small - it's down into the milleseconds. But milleseconds are huge if you have a faster system than your opponent. In fact, you may have beaten your opponent, but because he has a faster computer, his input is recognized faster, which means he wins.  
---
Games like Planetside2 recognized this issue, and have built engines on batching that allows for all player inputs to be matched against server time, and any and all inputs that occur based off of that time to be applied to the in-game mechanics/effects.  
---
This is a brilliant way to compensate for latency AND slower systems. Sure, it doesn't reward a guy for going out and spending $10,000 on a new computer as much as he may want, but it doesn't punish someone using an older system nearly as much, either.  
---
This allows for more competitive fields of play, and quite frankly, is a LOT more fun. I mean, when you win routinely, you KNOW you won. But even the best will sometimes lose a fight they shouldn't have lost, and that, quite frankly, is magical. It's not "clunky" - it takes away the monotony of the game. Because if you aren't careful, you'll get steamrolled by someone who isn't as well geared, or has an older system, etc.
---
Damnit! Missed opportunity!
---
Of course most PvP fights are unfair, it's not like every PvP experience must be a duel between two equally leveled and geared characters. 
---
It is unfair and, most importantly, immersion breaking when a laughing Horde player can hop around a flagged but ultimately powerless Alliance player in Ashenvale in an apparently contested war zone between two factions that despise each other. 
---
I don't have a problem with dishonourable kills. My problem is that Blizzard seemingly tagged who was "Civilian" or not entirely based off game functionality, with no concern for in-world logic. The one that I remember the most was a female orc Horde Scout in eastern Ashenvale, who was a Horde Questgiver and thus flagged as "Civilian".
---
She's literally an enemy soldier on active duty. What is this "civilian" BS?
---
worth noting that they will probably use their updated filters from retail, not the 1.12 filters.
---
Their classic team seems pretty legit. Otherwise I would agree without hesitation. But their classic teams are absolutely on-point. SC Remastered was really well done as well, and gave exactly what Brood War players wanted. Their Classic WoW team is doing even better in my eyes by doing even small things like spell batching. So I do understand what you're saying, and once WoW takes off a bit that might be a genuine concern. But for now I haven't seen any reason to doubt their Classic WoW team. 
---
Happening to me now on a private server boys. F in the chat
---
We were killing guards and some dumbass had to go kill a quest giver or vendor every time.  We weren’t looking to wipe the town out, just draw the alliance out.  Guards set off the alarms.  This would have been between 1.9 and 1.12, rankings mattered and a DK was a raid killer because of it.  I did very few of these because of it being consistently ruined by someone each time.
---
I'd say it plays a serious factor in its lesser perceived value in 2019. Top down trickle down is more relevant in the age of streamers and influencers than it has ever been in gaming history. Some people dont care, those who don't are still rolling hunter. 
---
This isn't bad mechanics. This is part of what made the game absolutely magical. Fun. Immersive and immaginative. You felt like you had a chance to beat someone who had better gear. You felt like you had a chance to beat someone who had a better computer. You felt like you had a chance to beat someone who lived right next to the server blades...  
---
I can't stress enough how big of a deal this is to re-creating a deliberate, calculated timing approach to every single encounter - PvP or PvE. This separates the gamers from the roll-players. This makes playing the game more of a calculation and preparation, rather than a bunch of face-rolling and monkey-levers.  
---
Nostalgia? Nah. This is oldschool, and oldschool beats newschool this round.
---
I know this is pretty late, don't use reddit a lot.
---
But pre 1.11 as elemental you either had 33/0/18 that gave you elemental mastery and a talent that if I remember correctly was also in the same tier that increased chain lightning by 10%. Can be checked with some clever googlefu with wayback machine.
---
Or 30/0/21 to get nature swiftness. Most shamans who dabbled with elemental would go for NS because it helped with raid healing.
---
After 1.11 the chain lightning talent was removed along with having multiple 31 point talents. Sadly what was suppose to be the shaman patch was an absolute cluster. Google bus shock and you'll still find snippets about it.
---
Thats a beautiful name / guild combo tbh 
---
/s?
---
No Undead anything, tired of the edgelord race that I thought was cool in middle school. 
---
Arena's aren't until TBC
---
They eventually realized mount collecting would be a big thing, so they switched it
---
Ah, someone gets it!
---
nope still unavailable 
---
Or just want to play the game as it was back then. 
---
Honestly without Nost I doubt we'd have classic today
---
He draw a tic tac toe board once. 
---
Kill razorgore, go kill the goblins and get a random drop epic, then get fucked by vael until he despawns for 24 hours! Good times 
---
For the same reason DM and Naxx won't be in launch.
---
The voice sounded fine.  A ‘nasally’ sound isn’t always fixable; some people are born with a deviated septum.
---
For Classic? Sure it's great and I'm very happy with that. As for live, sorry it's way too late. 
---
Exodia damage reflect build complete
---
Lots of people can't stand the feet..
---
For anyone who hasn't played these, they're unbelievably difficult. You will get frustrated. I highly highly recommend you play WC3 and its expansion instead (not the remastered shit with its altered plotlines and ruined voiceovers). I've beaten WC3 within the last year and can safely say its story, voice acting, art style, and gameplay hold up well enough for you to tide you over between now and Classic's release.
---
I’m not trying to debate the terminology used by my server 15 years ago. 
---
Actually batching has nothing to do with lag. It does fix lag, to a small degree, which is why people freak out about changing it.  
---
Lag is usually caused by end user computers, connection, location relavant to the network, and finally, the network blades themselves (if used).  
---
Batching, when used, creates a window where command inputs are all put into affect as they are received. They are stacked against a priority list (i.e., physical effect &gt; spell effect, so it is applied first) and then executed against the user interface.  
---
A smaller batching window means quicker "refresh" of the U.I., but also reduces the amount of effects for each change. While some prefer this method, this means that even the latency of your mouse/keyboard command effects your ability to match another player's input.  
---
You might be faster, but if they have better system equipment, they win. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but remember, this is a gaming community that is sick and tired of "mini-purchases" and other ways they are being nickle/dimed to death. Being forced to purchase the best equipment to stay relevant is just another way we are being stroked for more money.  
---
Larger batching also matches the rock-paper-scissors style of balance the vanilla game had. This improves group-play and helps reduce the solo style so many have adopted in retail. As a result of this solo style, many players have lost any semblence of decency and are not people you or any other decent human should ever have to interact with.  
---
I could go on, but this little change is a crucial one to establishing a community of players, enjoying a game, vs. just another money-maker for big-name developers.
---
I dont expect anybody who hasnt kept up on the metagame to really believe me on this one, but it's absolutely true. shit like 'hunter is good farmer' is entrenched in WoW Classic culture, it will take a while for people to realize that it's really not great at anything at geared 60, including farming. Hunter farms come online earlier, sure, but they lack the efficiency other builds do. So if you want to spend twice the time to get half the gold, a hunter is a solid, reliable option, and you will likely never die doing hunter farms, but if you're good at the game and able to handle mage or paladin farms, once you have the right gear setup, and this can even just be prebis, doesnt need to be anything fancy, you make so much more money per hour its not even funny. 
---
Only issue with mage farm specifically is that it comes out 4/m after launch, although there are likely other AoE farms for mages that also offer dramatically better GPM than hunter from the moment classic launches. 
---
Just because everyone says something is true does not mean it is true. Hunter being a farming god is one of them. Its farm just takes the least skill to execute, so its the build the most people can viably use. That does not mean it's the best.

Yeah, r10 to r11 is no joke, I quit at r10 on Elysi** even if I was part of a great premade. Just wasn't worth it imo. Either you quit at r10 or go all the way to r13/14.
---
The Dwarf Pally was my very first character. I loved him, and despite not being very good at the game, being a pally was very forgiving. I could out-DPS most other classes, even while wearing tank gear. I would choose the Dwarf Pally if I were you, but I am heavily biased. Also, fuck the horde. If you end up rolling an orc warlock I'm gonna find you and kick you in the ribs.
---
One thing to keep in mind is that Barrens is massive as has a much larger level range than Silverpine. One of the reasons this is important is that it's a "Horde" zone, which means that on a PvP server you can be safe from ganks until level 30 if you want (you probably want to get out around level 25 or so though), whereas you're only safe until level 20 for alliance. This is one of the reasons Redridge has the reputation it has, is it's often the first zone where you're in danger of being ganked on a PvP server as alliance. 
---
Additionally, the wide level range of Barrens makes for a slightly smother levelling experience as well, as travelling to new zones can take up a bit of time. 
---
Personally, I also really enjoy a lot of the quests in barrens (Mankrik's Wife notwithstanding). The King of the Beasts (it's something like that) quest chain in particular was great. It was like Green Hills of Stranglethorn but without getting ganked every fifteen minutes.  
---
With that said, you raise a good point about the crowdedness of classic servers at launch, so you may be right. Although I would expect that to not be so bad around level 15 or so. 
---
Ultimately I would say go with the one you prefer, and if you're on a PvP server I would eventually stop by just to stay in relative safety as long as possible... Unless you're looking forward to killing alliance scum as fast as possible, in which case by all means Silverpine until you're ready to ride out into Hillsbarad and wreck havoc. 
---
I'm sure they'll announce it on april 1st.
---
They will rent plenty extra servers for the launch. This is what Path of Exile for example has to do every new league start.
---
yus!
---
There absolutely were 1 button "scripts" even down to things like waiting x seconds before continuing a cast sequence. You could also have macros for specific conditions, like fear / stun, etc, including for yourself or your target. There's a reason the dev team has spoken about *not* recreating the same lua options this time around
---
I actually like this - I was afraid the 1.12 version of warriors would make them insanely popular, as they are on Pservers.  
---
Luckily, this will make them difficult to play effectively in PvP, and I am 100% ok with that!
---
I didnt rationalize it, I didnt even think about it. As a teen, I knew I had 200 bucks in my bank account, and that meant at least a years worth of WoW play time. Then, when the birthday comes round next year, I'll get another 200 dollars, and another year of WoW. It's a simple calculus.
---
Yep, which is why I didn't want to it come across personal if that's the case. There could still be room for speech / breathing exercises, lowering of tone can help, etc. Just one factor
---
I just thought of why I probably didn't notice before, since I played a paladin I rather ever interrupted back then. Will have to pay attention this time.
---
Exactly in line with my thinking
---
LMAO this is genius. I've always wondered why wrapping paper exists in-game, now I know.
---
WarCraft 1 is pretty close to unplayable by modern standards.  I didn't even like the game back in the day because games like C&amp;C were light years better.  Warcraft 2 was quite fun, but getting ready to get your ass kicked a lot. Pick your fights carefully.
---
I don’t see any reason not too. It would be a cool meme and the community would appreciate the humor. It would be good pr for Blizz.
---
Night elf had that too. It’s a satyr on a teldrassil branch. His bodyguards spawn if you attack/sap/fail and decimate you. Ow. 
---
Warcraft 2's Beyond the Dark Portal campaign is unbelievably difficult, you're absolutely right there. The campaigns in Warcraft Orcs and Humans are really easy though honestly, and the Tides of Darkness campaigns aren't too bad either. 
---
Never got past even the second level in either the Horde or Alliance Beyond the Dark Portal Campaigns, you're right there.
---
With that said, you can probably find them for free, rather than this website that I've never heard of before. You're also correct that WC3 RoC and TFT really set the stage for WoW, and are absolutely fantastic. I just finished playing through the campaigns again and they're all just SO good. The story is better than WoW's in some areas (...Kael'Thas was SUCH a great character before they just killed him off for no reason. Vasj too.) But yeah, I wouldn't call these "unbelievably difficult" overall. Orcs and Humans is just downright easy in fact.  
---
The best thing I ever did was create an alt char and send every piece of gold to it, refusing to spend the gold for any reason once it was received there. Kinda like managing money and saving for something in real life. Amount built up surprisingly quick and had epic mount in a few weeks. Would recommend!
---
Solid advance.  I'd add to it, that if you're leveling herbing or mining you'd be well disposed to get to 125-150 while in Silver Pine. Barrens sucks for both professions due to the size of the zone and the number of plays grabbing the easy to find nodes.
---
Thank you sir/madam/x!
---
 I am sooo excited to dedicate all my gaming time to the WoW universe. I have been craving to be a part of this game for a solid 10 years now so I've come here to ask; what's the best Orc/Class combination for someone that has never played WoW in his life?  
---
I'm mainly deciding between an Orc Warrior or Warlock... and maybe even a hunter? I would like to deal damage melee.   
---
stalin's there tho
---
wand is a separate bind from auto attack
---
Intresting.  I didn't realize how that worked, but I often jumped away from warriors who were charging me and now that I think about it, they often ended up out of range.  I didn't consuslously conect it at the time, but I must have known.
---
Reading through these is a good laugh.
---
If you're gifted tanking gear, don't expect to get DPS gear before the rest of the DPS warriors.  
---
My mom made me pay for my subscription if it was that important. $.50 a day is tricky when you don’t work. I cleaned up my whole city of cans (lived in NY at the time so there was a bottle deposit ). I would make her stop anywhere so I could check garbage cans and sidewalks for trash. Finally the , I Found my teacher’s lounge at school had a soda machine and got atleast 8-10 cans a day. It was like a gold mine that I had found and there was no candle
---
I can remember crying a little because I was so happy when I found that mountain of cans
---
A couple of blue posts ago stated the cloud keeper legs won’t come until AQ 40 / phase 5.
---
Neilyo was really the best at the time. Everyone I knew waited for his new videos to come out. He also got me into modest mouse which made up a good portion of the music he used. I'm not sure people would have cared as much if he wasn't vanishing spells regularly. It helped that Ming was regularly referring to people like him and Serennia as Naruto characters
---
Ffff
---
Nice! The next thing i would like to hear is : Sharding GONE!
---
Best to level an alt for your gathering professions 
---
Mage is the preferred option as you can blink to a target in a race to a node or a herb
---
you're being naive bro. 
---
activision/blizzard developers report to managers, and managers report to directors, and directors report to executives. 
---
this idea that the dev team has any real influence or say on whether the game will have cash shops/microtransactions is silly. 
---
guys at the top of the food chain make that type of decision. 
---
At least they seem to care about classic, which is good. What im hoping for in the next blue post is : Sharding - GONE!
---
If you're gonna do that, then you gotta have the ability to town portal, and go hostile to people of your faction. 
---
I think that'd be pretty cool actually. 
---
&gt;current MMO's / FPS quick paced game play. 
---
As someone who fits in the "25-34" age bracket I don't know about that. I played a lot of Halo 2 and 3 (and many other similar games) and those were pretty darn "quick paced", yet I fell in love with WoW. Just to say I don't think the current climate of games would stop an individual from enjoying the game. It would seem like either you appreciate the hard effort and immersion of the game or you don't. I knew people back in the day that played WoW and didn't like it then. Point being, I don't think it's fair to say "oh person A doesn't like classic wow? It's because of games these days and the way retail is". Although certainly that may be the case for some!
---
For example, my friends and I started towards the end of classic and all of us came back to play BFA. I don't care for it much, but 2 of my friends love it. They talk gear score and run mythic+ together, etc.. Yet they're also ecstatic for Classic and we're all going to be playing it together when it drops. So even someone who loves classic and played it back then can like BFA and the current scene of WoW.
---
All to say, I think it's less about age or previous game exposure and more about the individual and the type of challenges they enjoy. I'm confident there will be people in the younger crowd who distain Classic yet also those who experience it for the first time and instantly fall in love like many of us did way back when.
---
You're making it seem like people are at risk of randomly being assault with right-click reports. Even the possibility of "brigading" by angry streamers/e-celebs or whatever doesn't happen on live.
---
Dang you rich kids!
---
While hunters are farming Mara, where will the other classes be?
---
If anybody with a 1.12.1 client wants to try things out message me and I can link you my test realm's realm list. You'd have access to commands to give yourself whatever you want.
---
We weren't rich, I just had a big family. That 200 bucks was 20 dollars each from all my uncles, aunts, and grandparents. We were basically one broke down car away from poor. I played WoW on a laptop that my father brought home from work, which he only needed to use if he was sick and couldnt go into work. 
---
But the halitosis mon.
---
Not really. I'm aware that Blizzard is rolling out Classic in order to make money. But they've already tapped the microtransaction market with retail WoW. Arguably the entire reason why they're making Classic is that they saw pservers with huge numbers of players, and saw that as potential subs (and thus money) for them. They're aware that if they deliver retail """features""" like microtransactions then those players will return to private servers, so it doesn't even make for good fiscal policy to allow microtransactions with classic.   
---
This, again, is why so far we haven't seen anything like that from their classic teams. Their classic teams are targeting a different market than retail, and even if it's motivated by profit (like any buisness is to some extent), that doesn't mean it's a bad thing.   
---
What actual evidence do you have to support your claim that the classic team will pivot to a microtransaction model, and risk losing the market that wants to play WoW in its original form who will turn to pservers and away from giving Blizzard subscription money if that is they did make that decision? 
---
No he melee smacks the mobs with the wand.
---
Had to watch 3 times before i realized dad was speaking swedish.
---
How was the trip
---
Would it be good to level up herb and mining as a mage and then dropping herb for engineering at 60 for pvp ?
---
What a life. I remember selling my old books and toys just to buy the expansions. I gave up an electric train set for WOTLK. 
---
It discouraged intentional grieving while simultaneously discouraged world PvP in and around towns.   The easiest solution is to have every NPC that is marked as as a civilian to be invulnerable. Bam, World PvP doesn’t have disastrous honor deductions and at the same time, people can keep questing. 
---
I always use the movies as a comparison. Well it's (I think It was like 7.50 in 04?) $7.50 for 1.5 hrs of entertainment vs $15 for at least 100-300 hrs of entertainment. 
---
Very good
---
The closest thing to consensus that I've seen is level as herb/skinning and then drop skinning for the profession of your choice (usually alchemy). Of course there's a number of different variations however, and Hunters especially have different farming options than most, including a lot of people recommending solo-farming Mara at 60. 
---
I don't think "blinking to a node" as the other guy says is a huge factor, although some do enjoy farming with mages for the AoE. 
---
Is it just me or does High look better than Ultra
---
Dwarf priest or rogue. To me, dwarves aren't supposed to be spell casters. And I sure as hell dont think they would be any good at being sneaky. I could see them maybe being a shaman, as they are more in tune with nature, but that wasnt even an available combo in vanilla. 
---
I started by boycotting Blizzard thinking that the company is blinded by greed. Back then the mindset was paying $50 to buy and enjoy a game.
---
But to buy a $50 game then another $15 a month was outrageous. Not to mention internet costs for an online only game So I ended up missing a couple of months from launch. Then my resistance didn't last long before I realised how much effort was required to maintain the game, support and development.
---
After almost a year I realised that this game was saving my wallet in all aspects. 
---
What made nostalrius different from other servers?
---
Damn, I remember that day. I remember walking around and shoveling snow on a snow day to save up for Wrath. Damn, I worked so much harder as a child 
---
Counterpoint: I think the fact Blizzard waited so long to release RPvP servers during Vanilla was precisely what kneecapped their popularity and led to the idea they're such a niche thing in the first place. By the time they came around in 1.8 everyone had been playing and establishing themselves on other servers for nearly a year, which meant a lot of those who might have liked to play on such a server in the first place opted not to make the switch.
---
If they wait to release RPvP servers for Classic they'll be making the same mistake all over again. I genuinely believe the folks at Blizzard will be surprised by how popular they are if they're available at launch.
---
this place has some of the legendary circlejerking that reddit has ever seen.
---
I mean jesus christ this post is reaching faces of atheism level of cringle circlejerk.
---
Herb and mining can't both be tracked at once, so I would say either mining/skinning (you get less profit than herb/mining but can save up mats you might need for engineering) or herb/skinning and then drop skinning for engineering. 
---
Then with engineering, if you're going really hardcore with it, go for gnome spec, craft all the BoP items, and then drop engineering and train it again and go goblin spec. 
---
Who is he usually face to face with?
---
While we're talking about druids....
---
Y'know those healing pants Rasi got from King Gordok in Illegal Danish? Are those pants real? If so they are my only goal for classic.
---
Y'all are some really fun people at parties arent you?
---
Ive been gone from WoW for over 10 years.
---
Are you the people I have to look forward to?
---
Those are all good choices. Which ever appeals to you the most aesthetically is what you should pick. If you'd prefer to be up and personal, pick warrior, want to be a master of the dark arts, pick warlock, want to tame pets and shoot things pick hunter. Hunters and Locks are great for leveling. Warrior requires a bit more work, being less self sufficent, but its a power house at max. Lock is great start from the get go while Hunter takes a bit to get going but once you get your pet it comes together. I would say Hunter is the whonkiest of the 3. The pet management is more complicated than a locks, plus you still have to manage mana and you use both melee and ranged weapons.

They did that on nostalrius launch, think it dropped on our second run or something - https://i.imgur.com/754AVVB.jpg

Alright sweet, from what you've said as well as watching same gameplay, I will definitely be going with the Warlock! I cannot fking wait for July the 16th (pls blizzard)

"-you can probably find them for free, rather than this website that I've never heard of before."

gog.com (or good old games) is owned by CDProjekt, the people behind the Witcher games. They specialise in making older games playable on modern systems. Also gog is known for their no-drm -policy.

Oh excellent! Thank you for that. I formally retract my statement and will edit my post accordingly.
---
The issue retail is having goes much deeper than that. The server even lags in 40vs 40 battlegrounds.
---
ACTUALLALLY, Kim Kardashian is the one who got big banged.
---
Fact.
---
Happy too help. If you really want to figure it out you could always load up a non-retail server and try them out..
---
thanks gummy.
---
No problem, glad to help!
---
Yes I am doing exactly that, saving myself and going in relatively blind! 
---
Really, Arenas? over LFG? I would love to see non-ranked rewardless arenas
---
Yes, yes, and more yes. 
---
...but it's 1.12, released in phases at least
---
Yeah but there's also like 3-4x as many players on the server = more drops. Lol I mean jfc you said there's 8 on the ah... Most days on my old server there were zero, so when someone did get one it was worth a good amount. So no, your pserv info really isn't the amazing proof you want it to be
---
idsay go with what you want. me personally gonna go human Paladin, human priest or gnome warlock.
---
now if you want to minmax ur games as alliance, you wanna roll following classes as following races:
---
warrior - dwarf
---
rogue - gnome
---
hunter - i would say dwarf over nelf
---
priest -dwarf
---
mage and warlock - gnome
---
but yeah just pick the one that suits ur taste :) 
---
Spell batching has very little to do with lag. In fact, this adjustment will likely make it run smoother.
---
Video game ux is often intentionally backwards.
---
right, grinding the gold can be done in a few days, mount is a few weeks hah
---
Let's make it happen! We need those servers!
---
the best
---
Lol changed their minds? They, like 99% of WoW players, just didn’t think it was an issue. The thread got them thinking about it and then some intern looked at the server code and realised you just needed to change 2 numbers and they were like sure why not. But yeah sure #gAmErSuNiTe #nOcHaNgEs
---
Well it's a good thing you wont have any idea who anyone is, then.
---
God I love this community.
---
gummy died for our sins
---
I’m in that boat too.  Just wanna tank dungeons while leveling and get a truer tanking experience.  (Provides I’m up for the challenge.)
---
Everything you need was explained by Nixxiom
---
Enjoy

https://youtu.be/Jz8j-M3UuGw

the struggle haha
---
I'm not making anything seem like anything.  I'm admitting that not being able to use a public chat in a game built on community has an affect on playing the game.
---
Wow. This really speaks to the quality of design philosophy. Bravo.
---
I would argue that for some of us the lore of TBC really left a bad asteroid in our mouths as well. We may be in the minority, but we do exist. 
---
Looking at Druid tanking, to which I am very new. If tanking a group of 3 or so mobs, (and not including other threat generating abilities) is my best threat rotation tab-swipe or tab-maul?
---
He’s talking about TBC. LFG was WoTLK.
---
They have stated the item revamp for dungeon loot that occurred in 1.10 will not be present during the first couple of stages. Its strange they chose this particular patch (maybe because 0.5 tier quest mainly?) Are they going to filter other items that weren't available at early stages? Items like Crimson Felt Hat did not exist at release. The level 60 dungeon bosses used to drop greens most of the time, except the last boss that always dropped blues. These places had a lot less viable loot back in the day...most don't remember how sparse good shit was because the time spent in these patches was quite small and most players probably never even ran these dungeons before they were changed in 1.4 as it occurred only five months after release. In fact I would say 1.4 is probably the biggest patch in WoW history. It changed the entire face of the game and is probably the best "release ready" version of WoW. Items from Maraudon no longer overshadowed those from Scholomance and Stratholme, MC stopped dropping T2, and we got pvp gear. I think BRD still had mostly garbage loot in it except the deep bosses and their epics. I think that stayed til 1.10 bit i am not sure.

---
I missed making 40 man raids from SW chat asking for any druid or rogue I could get and then storming the valley of spirits all stealthed ready to gank
---
Technically I said "(almost) mandatory" obviously implying that it's only from some guilds.
---
A man of culture, I see.
---
I disagree. Sure if you are leveling an alt anyway then why not, but aside from that I don’t think it makes sense. If we say conservatively 8 days played to hit 60, that’s 200 hours. If we go on the low end of farming potential of 30g/hour that’s 6000g you could have farmed by just playing your main. So by leveling an alt to farm you are now 6000g in the hole before you even start farming. 
---
It would make more sense to level an alt to 35 and have them get 300 alchemy, tailoring etc than to get an alt just to be a gatherer. 
---
I got an idea, let's call it Wildstar
---
hunter loot

&gt;100-300 hrs of entertainment

You gotta pump those numbers up, those are rookie numbers.

---
im arrogant for asking a legitimate question? how moronic are you?
---
Hehe, mine has that :D  And thanks for the libram update
---
They are the weakest healer and had not OOC rez, the second weakest tank in a game where most people think only warriors can tank anyway, feral is a bottom 3 (5?) dps spec that requires a ton of work and specific gear to suck, and moonkin is a joke.  I mained a druid all through Vanilla and all the way till BFA, where I finally did give it up.  I'll never play a druid in Classic without major changes, I'd love to, but not the class as it stands in 1.12.
---
Maybe if there are that many locks I'll get to be that shadow priest :)
---
How do healing paladins do dmg in pvp? Cant remember if they have some offensive spells. 
---
Do you have a source for this?
---
Sm/ruin is a great pve spec, but rogues and warriors will (probably) have you for lunch. Soul-link is the best pvp build. 
---
Would you rather a new expansion after BFA or a new expansion after Classic? The latter is what WoW2 could be like if they realize BFA+ dies and people want Classic+.
---
I've seen this a bit in r/wow, it's really weird, I don't get it at all.
---
Nost quality was way above anything seen before it, and had an absolutely huge community. They surely made a big difference in getting Blizzard to change their minds.
---
Can they? I know dire maul doesnt get released right away, but can they farm there? 
---
He surely meant per month :-)
---
&gt;I interpret the first iteration of WoW as vanilla, TBC, and WotLK as a end of that product line, and "WoW 2" as the post Cata era. 
---
Not that this really matters to your point, but I think it would be WoW 4.
---
WoW1: Vanilla/TBC/Wrath
---
WoW2: Cata/MoP/WoD
---
WoW3: Legion/BFA
---
I'm not sure if which grouping WoD belongs in honestly, but I do think there are 3 pretty different eras of the game, Legion and BFA, are as different from Cata/MoP, as those were from the first group.  Because of Blizz's continuous abandoning of content, there is so little consistency across expansions, and that seems to be getting worse.
---
Thanks for your answer really useful from someone that played priest. 
---
Thanks for the tips
---
I'd say there was a reasonably big enough group (mostly pvp'ers) that really cared for it to be authentic.
---
Most people, including myself mostly just thought blizzard would never do it because we assumed that the modern retail client wouldn't be agreeable to that kind of system. 
---
God damn. This is the excuse *every fucking time* someone pulls off aggro.
---
Ok DPS, you only have 2 things to keep track of: Press this button repeadedly but stop for a while, when the bar with your name on it is almost as big as red one on top. Also don't stand in that colory-flashy stuff that comes up sometimes. Got it?
---
There was a dungeon finder in TBC. I only played Wrath up to level 78 so I dont think I would get that confused
---
So true. I started my WoW addiction by first playing WC3, I had gotten it from my grandma for christmas. It was the most amazing real time strategy game I had ever played. Immediately after I beat it, I decided to pirate WC1 and WC2. I gave up after 8 hours of getting fucked in the ass repeatedly, so I decided to give WoW a try. Downloaded the free trial and that was it. The next 4 years of my life went by in a flash. Good times.
---
good catch.
---
He's dead!?
---
Oh I'm aware. If you're not putting at least 12 hours a day into WoW, can you even call yourself a gamer?
---
Why would anyone want to change her? 
---
And why did you have to go and get me so excited at work...
---
I watched one of his videos, part of it anyway, until he said something like oh yeah so Edge Master's Hand guards are best in slot raid gear for warriors Hunter and Rogues right?
---
If you want to play a class that can be in at work, work is probably the best choice. It has weapons skill for PVE DPS, all that only really matters for warriors and Rogues can't use axes, for PVP the stun resist is impossible to overrate.
---
Tbh, having two toons to lvl up, is more time consuming than raiding.
---
For the tank vs healer situation. I see it the other way around. But then again I pref. Healing and just want to tank with my druid when necessary. 
---
You already know what you want. Go for it, or you are going to be unhappy.
---
I got into WoW a little late, so by the time I got into a RP server everyone else had pretty much stopped roleplaying. Nobody would even talk to me, much less role play with me. I tried several different RP servers and they were all the same, they were just regular servers like any other. It really bummed me out.
---
The news we want, though I don't think we'll find out unequivocally until the realm list is produced prior to launch.
---
I think the attention around RP-PvP has been significant.  Whether it has been enough to convince them is another story.  Fingers crossed.
---
Huh, you make a really good point there that I hadn’t considered. I think you’re right, even though the idea of a super busy bustling server is cool to me, the loss of community that would result from it is too big a risk. 
---
As a predominantly pvper, I was hoping it would be forgotten about and swept under the rug. It's really a double edged sword because it shows they're really committed to authenticity which is cool but I really wish that didn't extend to garbage like spell batching. Why anyone would want to play with induced lag that really only benefits rogues is beyond me. 
---
Manatide totem spreads its effect to 4 other casters, denying that much mana means this spec works on content already on farm, or you being carried. Either way play what you want and have fun.
---
Every raid can basicly bring 39 players and it wont make a difference. The effort every member brings is the difference.
---
So you can raid with no talents or pvp talents, hell i would even say raiding world bosses as lvl 1 is viable. lol
---
If you are not a jerk you will respec for your raids. Or try to get a deal where you raid as elemental. 
---
For those of you out there who are willing to risk your account for a funny name, there IS a program out there that can bypass the WoW name filter. Been using it for stupid names on private servers since like 2012, would be risky to use on an actual Blizzard client though.
---
Typically yes, herb makes the most money out of the gathering professions. 
---
Mega servers would be an absolute nightmare and essentially ruin the experience. I can't see them going that route. 
---
Also, keep in mind that for horde and Alliance having Shaman vs. Paladin means that the role of Druids in raids is actually different on each faction as well. Without paladins, or Druids tend to do more tank healing with their diamond ring Healing Touch which becomes very man efficient even compared to the best priest tank healing spells. With the lack of chain heal on Alliance side, Druids tend to use more Hots to top up raid damage. 
---
I was in highschool and I come from a poor family so yeah, 15$ was quite a sum for me back in those days.
---
It is also "unavailable" to me. First time I'm seeing this error. 
---
That's strange to me, too. Only ~10% of the entire population played on RP-PvP realms, and yet we're seeing 50% of people claiming they played them back in the day. There's a reason PvP realms are more populated than RP-PvP, and it's not just because of a different name. By taking away a PvP realm, you're taking away the most popular realm type, and giving it to the 3rd most popular. I don't understand why it seems like everyone and their mother used to play RP-PvP, when it's statistically minuscule.
---
Level as arms, not fury. You never have to be prot to tank, as long as you know what you're doing, although a 31/5/15 hybrid spec is very flexible (giving up enrage, but gaining last stand makes it only slightly less that perfect for pvp) 
---
Honestly? I’d rather burning crusade after classic. 
---
It still matters. Slow is better for instant attacks, like MS and SS, and also benefits more from extra swings via Sword Spec/WF/HoJ. If dual wielding you generally want faster OH as a Rogue for poison procs, but for Warrior you want the best DPS/Stat(I think) or a Flurry Axe if you're an Orc.
---
So they removed the damage bonus from slow weapons (which was actually a holdover copied from EverQuest, Weighted Axe anyone lol) but their high top end damage still makes them better for the above reasons. So slower is still better.
---
10-12k
---
Mining/engi till ZG comes out (make $ with mining while you have it) drop mining for tailoring for the bloodvine set. Or just keep mining if you already have T2 or better equivalent (kazzak legs, etc) 
---
By putting freedom on their warrior and protection on the mage
---
what happens when servers cap at 3k then over half of the server consists of "tourists" that leave the server after a month?
---
Unlikely, he's just massively underweight afaik 
---
You have nothing to worry about there will be many many many guilds in your shoes who will get through progression at a perfectly decent rate (:

This sounds like projection. They knew.
---
It is possible, however be prepared to be a teamplayer and spec resto in hard progression. 
---
Some fights can make or break a guild and if you are hardstuck on bosses like Loatheb, 4HM, Sapph or in AQ40 on C'thun consider to respec when the raidlead asks. 
---
However for farming content hybrid should totally suffice.
---
I would, too. But Blizzard might want to make an expansion to get the bi-annual $40 from the player base. In that case I'd much prefer WoW2 or Classic+ over what's after BFA
---
Feral dps is painfully tryhard just to not suck. And requires a different talent build than feral tanking, so in a raid you're not going to be good at both. 
---
Feral tanking is actually very competitive with warrior tanking, but being a main tank is a serious commitment for either class. 
---
What is the best choice? You didn’t name one 😂
---
I did a partial playthrough of WC1 about 2 years ago and gave up. I realized I just wasn't enjoying it as much as I'd hoped to. It's just too clunky.
---
Charging hopping! Man that brings back memories. Got "fixed" in cataclysm I believe? this one has to do with how the engine is able to stun you in midair. You see in old wow it was very possible to get stunned while knocked in the air by raid boss mechanics and become stuck in place (these sort of boss abilities became more common in later expansions).
---
https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/4216981811
---
then it'd probably be pretty similar to what you're used to when you account for 40% of your server being chinese, and the other 60% splitting their hours across their multiple time zones 
---
Yes, but it's hard as hell to find a 5man dungeon as a druid tank since people hate you. Also played all of TBC as a retripaladin (dps WAS good enough and you brought sooo many raid buffs no other class had), but it was hard as hell until I found my guild to even get a normal dungeon group.
---
People rather believe everything they see on the internet over trying if stuff works. That's my problem =(
---
Because it's blizzlike 
---
I knew I was buying $60 titles each month until WoW.  I justified $15 a month as saving $45 each month.
---
Hey you're right! I had forgotten about that. I was thinking of the LFD system 
---
&gt;**Dungeon Finder** is the "Looking for Dungeon" (LFD) system [Blizzard](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Blizz) introduced in [patch 3.3.0](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_3.3.0). It was made the default mode of the [Dungeon Finder window](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Dungeon_Finder_window) and integrated with the [Raid Finder](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Raid_Finder) and [Scenario Finder](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Scenario_Finder) in [Patch 5.0.4](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_5.0.4). It is only used for 5-man dungeons, not raids or groups in general for high-level quests. The Dungeon Finder selects players to form a party from all servers in the [battlegroup](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Battlegroup) of the current [realm](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Realm), so there need not be a full group of players on one specific realm.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;**Patch 3.3.0** is a content patch that included [Icecrown Citadel](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Icecrown_Citadel_(instance)) as a new raid instance as well as three 5-player dungeon wings in the [Frozen Halls](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Frozen_Halls). Patch 3.3 was to be the last major patch before the release of [World of Warcraft: Cataclysm](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_Cataclysm). 
---
But in Blizzard's Patch notes:
---
3.3.0
---
&gt;**CROSS-REALM DUNGEON FINDER**  
---
&gt;The Dungeon Finder is now available, providing players with quick and easy access to five-player parties. This feature connects all realms within a battlegroup using an advanced matchmaking system, making it easier for players of all levels to find a dungeon group. In addition, players can reap additional rewards through the Dungeon Finder by choosing the Random option, which is available to both pick-up and pre-formed groups. Check out the User Interface section for more details.
---
Then in the UI section of that patch:
---
&gt;Dungeon Finder  
---
&gt;This feature has **replaced the Looking For Group** tool and provides all-new dungeon party creation functionality.
---
Then in patch 2.0.1
---
&gt;Looking for Group Interface Tool  
---
&gt;A new Looking For Group tool designed to assist players in finding groups for instanced dungeons and quests will now be available. This interface gives players the option to be added to a pool of other players also looking for a group, as a means to expedite the process. In addition, players will also be able to search for additional members in situations where they have a group and are simply looking to find more players. For a complete overview of this new interface, please take a moment and read the information contained on our comprehensive Looking for Group preview.
---
So good call on that, I think a lot of us had forgotten that.
---
Still, that one didn't take players directly into the dungeon, nor was it cross-server. So it didn't really impact community much. But you're right, it did exist. 
---
Isn't going from "it's not an issue" to "yeah let's implement it" a change of mind?
---
Didn’t know that Axl Rose was interested in Classic 
---
oy vey
---
Keep calm, with the great work the Classic team has done so far I think it's an almost guarantee that we'll get RpPvP servers at launch.
---
&gt;**It's really a double edged sword because it shows they're really committed to authenticity**
---
&gt; Well, now I know you either didnt play vanilla or didnt pvp/was too young to understand =)
---
You cannot do the /sit macro to get reckbomb procs in classic, thats what i mean. And you are sadly wrong in both of your assumptions, guess that makes you a ...
---
Since you enjoy watching Nixxiom, watch his prediction on this very point 6 months ago.
---
https://youtu.be/S4nhQfp0NDg
---
So RP-PVP servers are official then!
---
Does anyone have a source to confirm that 2.5K was the cap in Vanilla? I've heard numbers from 2.5K to 4.5K, but my thought is that it was 2.5K at launch and bumped up to 3.5-4.5K in the TBC pre-patch. Only going from memory here, and I also seem to recall being told that the above numbers are actually not quite right anyway.
---
Free transfers from low pop realms to medium pop ones.

Do silverpine 12-16 then go to barrens
---
Definitely not, it's an old poll with thousands of votes, with very little votes from the past couple days (I'm not saying I have exact numbers but it had thousands of votes a week ago too)
---
They can kill lashers even at like 53 with prot talents and shield spike
---
Later a normal holyspec works u just need enough mana
---
There is a vid in yt somewhere
---
Or just 2man the bosses
---
But idk how profitable it will be for real now
---
Well, you are now solely talking about making money. A PVP'er absolutely needs engineering. So do alchemy on the alt, like i suggested or just sell herbs. You can still make almost all of the potions, elixirs etc at L35.
---
Hi, /u/NarutoShadowClone
---
You asked why people wanted it
---
With Ray J of all people. I mean I get Kanye, but (literally) fucking Ray J? Nasty
---
When does it release?
---
The problem with this spec is that it is a hybrid spec but the dps side is just not suited for raiding before you get AQ gear. Even the most diehard ele shamans admit that. It's great for PvP where you aren't fighting things that have nature resistance and take 5mins to die.
---
You could for example do PvP in your raiding spec. Why don't you do that instead? Deep resto (0/5/46) isn't popular for PvP but actually packs quite some healing power, improved Ankh, anti-pushback as well. You're a strong player with good skill, so you can make it work!
---
Or just farm the little bit of gold to respec. It's not much. Do a couple of dungeon farm runs with your buddies, fast and efficiently and you can respec even twice a week. Your Warrior friends have to do it too.
---
&gt;I switched to a Tauren druid and never returned to the Alliance).
---
Horde scum. 
---
But I also cant wait to roll an alliance priest. My buddy is gonna be a tank, so we'll be in high demand for any dungeons.
---
I’d rather something to come after BFA so we can get burning crusade. I don’t understand your logic. 
---
But do they have phones?
---
kind of implies beyond the reason I stated 
---
Blizz wanted in on those sweet esport shekels so using arenas as an excuse it began to whittle down the talent trees.
---
Only if he isn't put into a caster/healer group for Manatide. Then no amount of gear can make up for it.
---
I'm not talking about rekbomb. I'm talking about retris having an insane burst damage with good PvP gear. Go watch some PVP videos with retris from vanilla, they can kill people with same gear level in a stun when they're around T2~ gear.

Bad.. more like average

Like rfd/rfk/sm pickpocket runs are like 30-50g/h

same for just farming bats/worms in epl for trash skins and random gathering

You can't just type vulgar words like that, you monster!
---
I am impressed. Me personally, I would say just do it as modern WoW does it, because modern WoW's system is better, and I'd be interested in playing classic without some of classic's janky mechanics. But that's the whole point -- they are choosing to stand up for the #nochanges folks and prioritize their experience over people like me (who are casually and somewhat ignorantly wistful of a "intelligent changes please" approach. 
---
This is a really good sign for diehard classic fans -- it is really looking like you might just get what yall wanted. 
---
I'm still pushing for original item stats. Let MC epics matter! We want dungeon blues to be in original 1.0 state so when you zone into your first raid it's an awesome and rewarding experience.
---
Rogue: slow MH, fast OH.
---
Warrior: slow MH and slow OH. 
---
We used to enjoy that. We still do, but we used to, too. 
---
He'll probably never actually reach rank 12 and won't end up killing a single civillian, proving that the system truly does work.
---
Ok. So instant attacks still do more damage with slower weapons? Just no bonus modifier?
---
Just a quick question, how would that be « exponentially less spell calculations » ?
---
By lowering the frequency it is just a linear transformation right?
---
Back in vanilla I always assumed everything spellbatch related was because of my terrible latency lol. I didn't realsie it was actually working as intended.
---
Engineering is quite cheap to level later, so this wont be a problem. Especially if you send to alt/bank your STONES (ores/bars are usually bit later dirt cheap due how much you get of em compared to stones, not really worth the bag space in most cases).
---
NO CHANGES
---
It’s a warrior with Thunderfury... just kill him. 
---
Oh I remember WoWemu! It was the shit. It was basically just the world explorer, like with no mechanics. No armor (priests tanking), no attacking when moving (lol) etc.
---
I think you are purposefully being difficult and understand exactly how the two situations are different. The context is very clear - "sharding is antithetical to a cohesive community".
---
If trusting Blizzard is the issue then there isn't anything they can really do or say to change that is there? How do we even know that Classic isn't just a big hoax? 
---
Blizzard knows perfectly well that saving a marginal amount of money by implementing sharding would not be worth it if they lose tons of subs.
---
It should be fine. But you won’t have mana tide and your healing will be quite a bit weaker. 
---
Before I played WoW, I went to clubs every weekend and spent like $200. So playing video games saved me alot of money. Yeah Switzerland is very expensive if you want to go clubbing.
---
The story about Nost and the petition being brought into life not only caught the already active demand for classic. People like me, who never played or would have played on a private server, got wind of it and signed the petition.

---
&gt;Fair play to Asmon
---
the modern way of saying this is "ASMONGOLD IN SHAMBLES!" or something
---
&gt; I didn't realise it was actually working as intended.
---
Not really intended (as servers had limitations that they have since gotten rid of). But since it was like that in vanilla, they wanted to make classic the same way. Even if it was going backwards in game responsiveness. 
---
Player preference, I just meant Orc is the best race for any of those classes

Can you provide some source? I am interested by this but can't google anything.

I think Cata and WoD were bridge expansions. With Cata they were quite visibly trying to "shake things up" and provide a fresh look for their aging world...and that backfired hard as fuck, killing off a lot of die hard fans that Blizzard had created AMAZING end game content for. Cata, content wise, was wonderful. Aesthetically and thematically it fucking sucked. The only cool thing about Deathwing is his Hearthstone card. Cata was meant to bridge from old school WoW to new school, which was MoPs heyday. MoP was the opposite of Cata: wonderful thematically and aesthetically, but shitty content (these are some of the worst raids and dungeons in WoW) and a horrible slog of daily quests and convoluted rep grinds. 
---
Then they upped the whole "solo" aspect that was introduced with MoPs farm and gave everyone a home base in the garrison. Now, when WoD released, aside from not being able to finish the quest because of bugs, getting your garrison was fucking awesome. It really was. Also, the zones and the first raid in WoD were FUN. I thoroughly enjoyed leveling and playing WoD....at first. But let me tell you, that garrison shit, and especially that god damn shipyard got real old real fast. 
---
After this Blizzard realized their mistake and took the "individual areas" away and turned them into items, the Artifact weapons! Which were, once again, great and awesome in the beginning but turned into a terrible grind. But hey at least we weren't spending hours alone in our hermit huts. This is the start of WoW3, where "everything is mobile." Thus the game has lost all of its identity because it kept experimenting with what it wanted its players to do, instead of giving its players what they want to experience. The game slowly became less 'how will this make the player feel' and more 'what cool stuff can we get the players to participate in." Essentially they wanted to capitalize on the addiction factor, and instead of just producing more high quality marijuana they forced souped up amphetamines onto us.
---
Instant attacks, windfury procs and so on, use the base damage as a modifier, not DPS. If a quick low damage weapon has similar DPS as a big hitter with low speed, the big hitter will win in weapon "spells" and free attacks, effectively being better. As a warrior you pretty much want a good DPS offhand, as a rogue you might go for a fast one to apply more poisons. Either way, your skills base off your mainhand weapon damage, not mainhand DPS.
---
&gt; What you seem to want is to just be able to go into IF or Org and fuck up the city with no repercussions.
---
You're missing his point.  He's saying that this is going to happen regardless of DHKs because not everyone cares about DHKs.  People who are super serious about rank might avoid large group PvP, but that's it.  Most people aren't super serious about rank and some people even go out of their way to farm DHKs and be as disruptive as possible.
---
So what is the point of the DHK system?  Is it to discourage the killing of quest NPCs and the like?  It doesn't do that, most people don't care about rank or DHKs.  All it does is make super serious rankers scared to join WPvP groups.  Was this the intent behind the system?  Probably not.
---
So since it doesn't succeed in its purpose and it brings some downsides for WPvP, some people think it should just be scrapped.  If Blizzard really doesn't want people to kill quest NPCs then they should make them unkillable or something.
---
I'd rather talk about sharding instead. It seems more important tbh. 
---
I too would like to know.  Sorry to get your hopes up with the notification!
---
That's certainly not true... There are many people that have no interest in touching a new expansion after BFA. People who don't care for retail at all and have had enough disappointment expansion after expansion. WoW 2 would at the very least give the hope of a clean slate (one without LFR, CRZ, sharding, phasing, flying, heirlooms, artifact power, etc etc). The audience for WoW 2 would easily be larger than the audience for the next expansion. People who hadn't played WoW in years would come out of the woodwork to try it out where as they might not get hyped for an expansion

Human anything.  Worst and most boring race ever.  Most of my early characters were Human and I’ve regretted it ever since.
---
Fury is surprisingly good in world PvP and can melt most classes with a few hits. Thunderfury indicates other topend gear.
---
The perfect game (and a life ruining game for me) would be honestly just rereleasing WoW as a fresh game, metering out the expansions every year, and keeping the old school style of open world exploration, collaboration, and difficulty. All the content, fuck it, you can re-use it, you can use the quest scripting quality of later WoW, the zone design of later WoW, etc, but for god's sake, just make it hard enough for me to care and feel some pride and accomplishment. 
---
WoW 2 - just do what you did, without all of the stupid shit that ruined it
---
Just be the token dagger fury war.

This so much, it takes extreme dedication to level a 60 just for farming.. 215+ hours of leveling just to spend more hours farming.

"The goal of the system is to discourage griefing."
---
And it doesn't help at all. Rankers aren't the one griefing quest givers regardless if there is dhk or not, they will spend all of their time either in bg or camping players in quest hubs for honor without killing any civilians.
---
Griefers that will camp quest givers in low level area don't care about dhk since they aren't ranking to begin with if they waste their time with such thing.
---
“Priests will not be able to level due to dealing with having to heal”
---
U wot. You level as shadow + wand specialization. Shadow priests do absolutely disgusting damage in PvP
---
I agree that would be a good solution. However I just can't see Blizzard doing that. They fucked this kind of stuff up in retail and unfortunatelly that doesn't make me very optimistic that they get it right in classic.
---
My suspicion on what's going to happen: They will probably set the population limit to 3.5k - 5k. The starting zones will be heavily phased. Things will die down to about 2k after a while.

He said suboptimal but decent in both pve and pvp

What's wrong with that ?

I used to be 12 at the time and I lived (still live) in a poor country (Bulgaria). I used to save money from the little allowance that I got and shared the account with a friend. He was mostly raiding while I was spending my time doing mostly PvP and making money by playing the auction house probably up until Season 3 during TBC. We also used to buy the 2 month cards from the local game store that were worth 25 Euros to avoid using a subscription, since we didn't want our parents knowing that we were spending money on games.
---
What would happen when servers were capped at 8k and only 1k left? A horrible experience all around
---
I don't see the problem. Some of the Pservers I was on had 25k people on at a time and it still worked great.
---
U dont know if the coin values will be as high as on pservers
---
If I understand it correctly, the hard lines tells you if it's shared or not?
---
An amazing list. Thanks mate.

It's nice to be able to put out decent dps even if it is tryhard y'know

Yes!

i see. thanks!

why?

That rule only applies to pvp servers and is specific to the server not your account.

In old wow servers used to handle player inputs differently. Something like inputs only going through in a certain millisecond time interval. So lets say if a rogue blinded someone at time=x and in another world at time=x+100ms or so. There was a good chance that they would both land in the same upload time interval and actually have both blinds go off at the same time in-game. This allowed for 2 rogues to gouge each other, 2 rogues to blind each other or 2 priests to fear each other and (potentially) brought mechanics like vanishing cc/dmg as well. Spell batching basically shapes the entire pvp meta of vanilla, meta would completely change if they were to use legion input handling.
---
The time interval was changed around as expansions went from I believe about 300ms - 50ms.
---
they might still do it.
---
i have my 1-10 exploring path set just in case.
---
Speaking from experience, my friends took a ton of convincing to play a classic WoW private server with me. I wanted us to be a good team, tank healer and DPS, but they both wanted to do their own thing. I almost lost their interest with trying to convince them to do what I wanted them to do, so you should just explain all the class/race combos and let your friend pick whatever he thinks is the coolest. We ended up all being DPS (I was a warrior, they were a hunter and rogue), but we had a great time. Sure, getting into dungeons was a bitch and a half, but the most important thing is that you have fun, or else what's the point? 
---
Playing a paladin atm in privateserver, have full T2 set, BWL 2h's and very soon AQ weapons. Not playing in retri spec, but i wouldnt call it "insane burst".
---
Almost all "vanilla retri" vids ARE reckbomb videos, since it was the way to kill ppl.
---
Myeah I was thinking of pickpocketing with my rogue in rfd herbing gravemoss and d/eing boss loot. Later with decent gear go for princess and the brd runs with the bosss that drops the formula. Its just that my spec wont be raid standard for that time. Skinning being dropped at 60 for disench.
---
It also indicates tank gear.
---
Honestly i think they will do it, but i wont like it, and im sure the majority wont like it. And the most damaging thing about it is it opens upp the possiblity that they might use it in the future of classic as well :/
---
Then you might be doing something wrong. Retri paladins were very powerful in PvP with good gear. And there are plenty of good retri pally PvP vids post reckbomb.
---
The game is getting finished, they can talk about features since they have it locked down. Cant comment/communicate on decisions you havent fucking made yet...
---
I agree. I'd like a lag free version of classic.

a sample size of 1 might as well be thrown in the trash

i still do m+ on retail and he just got really unlucky with that group, retail players are fine

Why a picture of a pvp geared warrior if the guide is for pve

It’s ok to be wrong lil guy there there
---
Like the warrior tank who got 4/5 T2.5 on first AQ40 to keep his TPS through the roof? 
---
Tank gear in todays meta is pretty much: "How much tank gear can I shave off for DPS gear in order to barely stay alive and keep my DPSers from overtaking me. Do I need a shield for this boss?"
---
Drakefang Talisman, Onslaught girdle,  Band of Accuria etc. are all great tank items to keep threat up, especially for horde.
---
I started out at the end of BC, about a month before wrath came out. I was a total noob but I did some pretty decent DPS on my ret pally. However, I was a well known transvestite. No, I didnt dress in women's clothing. What I did was far more perverted. Any piece of armor that dropped in a raid or dungeon that had better stats than what I was currently wearing, I clicked Need on. I had no idea that there was a difference between tank, healer, and DPS gear. I was always wearing a mix of 3 different specs gear. My guild master got mad at me and called me a transvestite, and had to explain to me that I was an idiot and that wearing gear that was meant for a tank or healer meant that I wasnt optimizing my DPS. 
---
I still didnt understand. 
---
Better than signatures. A signature without follow through is easy. Those players signed with their server population. It showed they would follow through with it, too.
---
I think that's just how they are.
---
What really got nerfed was aim shot with that shit blue crossbow that was extremely slow. It would 2 shot people in battlegrounds back in the day. I am trying to find the old pvp videos with it. 
---
Phasing!
---
Problem is that it’s *real* tedious for guild/raid leaders to sift through every non-healing shaman, paladin, druid and priest. 
---
I love me some ret, and I’ve tried to make it work before, but the reality is that your raid group should have enough paladins to cover the essential blessings (typically ~3) and from there your utility is negligible - i. e. a Freedom here and there, an aura for your group and your one hour cooldowns in LoH and DI.
---
The fact is also that the ret needs to put in a spectacular amount of work and consumables to just compete for middle-of-the-pack dps with all the terrible warriors that are barely trying. If you wanna play a universally *good* support/utility class, consider a hunter. They bring a skillset that nobody else can match, in return for their below-average dps. 
---
This means u can use tremor totem as you're getting feared, right?
---
Made a gnome warlock for some unknown reason. Loved the class, hated the race. 
---
Heck yes. Hell, on my first character I thought grey items were worth the least so I never picked them up to vendor them. Then I got to STV and I started noticing greys that were worth like 60 silver a pop for like a grey club or something and was like my goodness what have I done!? Can’t wait to pickup and vendor EVERYTHING. 
---
Also not going for enchanting this time. Forget that noise.
---
I saved a TON playing wow, if you skipped one night on the town, you could sub for 6-12months+ with that ...
---
&gt;we're gonna try to get ahead of the pack
---
Good luck with that. You do know that you'll be up against people who have no life, right? I'm talking about people who play 18+ hours a day, and have been waiting for classic WoW to come out since before it was ever even announced. 
---
To answer your question though, I'm gonna speed level as best as I can for my main. I'm hoping my friend will join me, but most likely I'll be going solo. I'm hoping to get level 20 in 10 days or less. 
---
There's no great advantage to a slow OH for warrior. Fast OH gets more OP procs which is pretty significant at the lower gear levels. You get more UW procs too, the only downside is it will consume more instant attack flurry charges but it's a very minor impact.
---
Alt characters, the destroyers of your gold reserves. "oh, that would be nice on my alt!". Ofc my alt warr needs devilsaur set and lionheart helm.
---
Take it with a grain of salt though.
---
Various pserver had various items and potions stack or  not stack resulting in wildly different outcomes. 
---
In classic will we see how it goes.
---
That'll be against the classic TOS, so at that point you might as well consider just buying the classic gold outright from some Chinese farmer site. How do I know it'll be against the classic TOS? Because Blizz has no way to protect you in that trade and if they allowed it to happen freely they might as well just introduce tokens into classic, which they won't.
---
Sure, you'll totally get away with it, but that's not the point - you could just buy gold "illegally" in the "old times" too.
---
Is everyone ok with vanilla respecs? I can't  be fucked farming to be able to play both pve and pvp. Don't have time with life moving on 10 years. Game deal breaker for me

I've zero intention to play on one, but I would feel bad for the RP-PvP players if they had to wait weeks after release untill they finally get there server.

There were a lot of Elves that were mages, but after the sundering there was a split. The night elves basically made all arcane magic illegal but some of the Night Elves wanted to continue the practice(many of them 
---
 were highborne). These arcane practitioners were exiled and they left for the eastern continent and later became the blood elves.
---
So at the start of Vanilla WoW there were no Nelf mages as it was abhorrent to them and illegal.

RK3 only would take 15 honor kills a week to maintain.
---
The question is how pvp gear is going to be handled. In vanilla, you hit rank 14, you bought the rank gear. Then rank gear got re-released with a new revised version and you had to rerank to buy the new set of gear. I imagine you have to maintain at least rk3 for the discount but that would take literally no time.
---
Maintaining rank 12 until blizzard releases the revamped pvp on the otherhand... 
---
Seal of command is the only skill that actually can give you any burst damage. Others are small upgrades on what you normally do. And ofc you can make videos of when EVERYTHING procs and you feel great, but thats not what its like normally.

---
For main hand slower is better, due to instant attacks. This applies to tanks as well(only exception would be when you get so much rage you can always use heroic strike, then a faster weapon will be more threat, like on Vael).
---
For offhand rogues prefer faster OH for poison and as for warriors it impacts flurry uptime in a really complicated way based on both mainhand and offhand attackspeed. Here is a simulation I ran: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Usq1zqceb3fvIxcCJWrAcK6ilTEHzn6l3ePQGIc7ZeE/edit?usp=sharing

Hunters also prefer slow weapons due to aimed shot cast time and clipping auto attacks.

So again, I don't know what you might be doing wrong =(

Population cap should be increased drastically while sharding is active. Also, the number of servers should be minimal at the start. 
---
P.S. Server transfers were never enough to balance population across all servers evenly. There were always dead and overcrowded servers simultaneously.

Im still trying to convinse my girlfriend into wow but explaining to her that I need to farm lashers for 10 hours a week to buy consumables to kill a boss where I click 1 spell for 5 minutes didn't get her intrested.

Maybe you're thinking of the troll berserking ability that cost either rage or mana depending on your class ?
---
I didn't realize RPVP was a late change to Vanilla, wow. Yeah I hope the threshold of Classic subs/income they think they need to warrant RPVP is low enough so that it can be a much earlier addition this time around. 
---
But who knows, maybe they're considering a "fresh" idea, or how they plan to carry out new servers/merges of dead servers in the future. Maybe RPVP would take off better on Round 2 of Vanilla, where people can make their toons when the leveling process is relevant to the server.
---
With your last point, I also agree. '04 Blizzard didn't expect the numbers, and I think a mostly new team at '19 Blizzard is also making the same "mistake".

I think itd be neat to get new stuff in the new Classic WoW experience. It would definitely need to be after the final classic raid comes out, like you say. Adding new stuff like BGs or maybe even a new dungeon or raid would make it feel like this world is in a separate timeline or something.
---
people have pointed out how this would affect the value of bag space and bank alts. Otherwise I think it would be a great addition even though it never existed in classic.
---
Agree 
---
&gt;that really only benefits rogues
---
Since rogues are 50% of the PVP server population here goes your answer :D
---
Join a guild early where they plan to have special rules for legendary drops (hell even be one of the founder of the guild, pala class leader etc). State your intentions early that you really want to get sulfuras. Raid as holy with stable attendance.
---
When the legendary mats drop go for them. You should only be competing with warriors who want sulfuras for arms pvp off spec (same as you with ret pvp off spec). I think its easy to settle with these warriors that you want sulfuras (and sulfuras only) and they can have prio on other good 2h weps (e.g. ashkandi).
---
After the hammer is done, get full t2 and become the ret paladin of the fan arts. (Later you may go for t2.5 for actual stats hehe)
---
This is a coherent and respectable vanilla story. Make it happen. From your description I cant really see why would you enjoy warlock gameplay.
---
His point is that this is exactly one of those things where it being blizzlike should be overruled by its outdated nature for most rational people.
---
Does anyone have any advice to get from Durotar to Tirisfal Glades? I want to level an Orc, but I much prefer the Undead starting zone and Siiverpine.
---
For example: if I die and spawn at one graveyard. Can I run and resurrect at another closer to the Zepplin outside Orgrimmar?
---
Here's one of the foremost living cosmologists talking about it:

I'm never surprised there are ignorant people in the world.  I'm constantly surprised at how proud of their ignorance they seem to be, and how willing they are to out themselves.
---
&gt;Adversity is a form of content all its own
---
That's the best thing I've read today, just really encapsulates the Classic experience.
---
Doing the [For the Alliance] or [For the Horde] achievements with several 80 player raid groups was the absolute best time I've ever had in wow. Gathering in the barrens with hundreds of people, preparing to storm Orgrimmar and getting each other hyped the fuck up, then mounting up and rampaging into the enemy city to kill their leader was a religious experience for me. This will absolutely happen in Classic WoW. By the time enough people make it to level 60, you can be sure that people will be setting up world PvP expeditions. I cannot fucking wait.
---
I personally don't think it would affect much because most bags are personal, and you dont put stuff into guild bank because you dont have room in your bags. It would mostly get rid of the guild bank alts which is a pain to keep up with to be honest. Still, don't think they'll implement it at first.
---
Nope. Time for the old days where u trusted someone with the : Guild Bank" Person. My guild never allowed the GM to have it. It was his rule. He always said it showed he would run off if another officer had it. Was always amazing. Hell when the officer left. i remember him trading everything to us to the new guild bank lol. 
---
When you people still believe Activision has any say in Blizzard omehalul
---
Get more people and camp him till he calls his no-life buddies.
---
Classic content creators basically devour any official info we get because you know, revenue. 
---
I've said this many times before, but for me the most fun i ever had was on a 5k-ish server. If you logged on at night there'd be 5k and you'd have massive world pvp, dungeons everywhere and PuG raids, but you still knew every single person. And if you logged on in the morning or something there'd still be around 2k people online so you could do dungeons and have fun.
---
I'm fine with Blizzard sticking to the original caps. That might be the best idea. But i'd be lying if I didn't say that around 4-5k is probably where i'd have the most fun. At least 4k.
---
I still remember waking up one morning and some Australians were doing a PuG MC run and needed a tank, it was so fun to just be doing MC randomly some tuesday morning. That's why i like higher pop servers.
---
And especially as someone that doesn't PVP, I agree it's absolutely stupid.  I think a lot of people don't even know what they're talking about with this subject.  They act like it's a major gameplay mechanic they can play around when it's really just coincidental scenarios most of the time that make no sense for a decent video game.
---
Then again, PVP in MMORPGs has always been a joke to me, including WoW (although it has the best), so I guess they might as well go all the way with the Classic silliness.  I just think it's really stupid, and I'll be actually upset if it affects PVE.
---
In fact, now that I think about it, I know that it almost certainly will at least affect healing anyone besides yourself, so...that's just fucking great.  Welcome back to Lay on Hands rarely not saving someone because their death registered first.
---
&gt; gravemoss
---
stocking up on high amounts of gravemoss is a great idea, especially at the start of the server. If you don't sell it but wait till later raid tiers are launched you can make lots of money.  The disadvantage obviously that you can't buy mounts with gravemoss 
---
There is a reason you dont use wikis as proof. They can be edited by anyone to say anything. Thats pretty common knowledge.
---
The item ID for Lionheart helm is 12640. This puts the item at the earlier patch. Titanic leggings f.ex which came out in patch 1.10 has and item ID of 22385. Blizzard add items to the game chronologically.
---
Here's proof the item existed in the game in march 2005, which would be patch 1.3. It's possible the item existed before this too, although I cant be bothered to do any more digging.
---
 [https://web.archive.org/web/20050327104756/http://wow.allakhazam.com:80/db/item.html?witem=12640](https://web.archive.org/web/20050327104756/http://wow.allakhazam.com:80/db/item.html?witem=12640) 
---
&gt; Then rank gear got re-released with a new revised version and you had to rerank to buy the new set of gear.
---
&gt;Maintaining rank 12
---
When Blizzard Updated the PvP sets in 1.11 they introduced a NEW Blue set (rank 6-10) and updated the Purple set (12-13) and introduced new weapons (rank 14).
---
You would not have needed to maintain anything above rank 10 for a new PvP set, if you already had r13 gear, you would have the updated version.
---
Blizzard has shown an aversion to progressive itemization. They do not want to alter gear's stats, they have only shown in interest in delaying items if they represent significant thwarted gear progression (see: Titan Leggings and Spellweaver's Turban).
---
All that being said, they haven't picked a side for PvP gear- yes it was available from the honor system forward, but in a **VERY** different state, which has caused them to delay their decision on what phase it will be present in. Maybe they decide the only option is to progressively itemize. Maybe they'll just release everything but the new weapons.
---
Either way you'd have to maintain rank 14 or rank 10 for new items. Not rank 12.
---
Yes. And if it's abuse you open up a ticket, contest the mute and you're free to go in like 10-15 minutes. Like: just go AFK for that amount of time, it's not a deal-breaker. It happend to me, it happend to others. But luckily the contest seem to have a high priority.
---
And guess what? The abuser recieve a ban/mute for a certain amount of time.
---
Classic will suck for the vast majority of players who play retail and don't really know what to expect. They'll try it out and quit very quickly. There will still be several hundred thousands of players who like the classic play style and will be playing it 1-2 years in, but it's going to launch with millions of people playing.
---
$15 &gt; spending a lot more going out, or buying new games each month.  I have thought this, since 1999 or even earlier.
---
Yes, you can find it in the pet skill tab and train it to your new pet, provided it has the skill points for it (which is at higher loyalty levels). But it's only the lvl 10-11 cats in Darkshore that don't have claw. I think the higher ones have it right from the bat.
---
Lot of people here saying you won’t ever get if, simply not true. 
---
You can find a guild that will let you ret. Esfand on YouTube has a guide on what stats you should stack and how to raid as ret in pve. That said, guilds may ask you to heal regardless. 
---
There were/are plenty of paladins out there with sulfuras - if you’re willing to run mc long enough, you’ll get it eventually!
---
Why are you excited for loot trading?
---
https://etcanada.com/news/400391/mickey-rourke-and-axl-rose-get-mistaken-for-couple-celebrating-50th-anniversary/
---
You know you're looking like shit when you stand next to mickey rourke and make him look good.
---
I don't get how they can manage pop with sharding.
---
If they let let's say 10k people roll on one server at launch assuming only 1/4 will remain after one month what happens if they're wrong and 1/10 (1k players server unpopulated) or 1/2 (5k players server surpopulated) stay on the server ?
---
I was in a huge wpvp guild. We had many weekly raids on all the cities and redridge, stv, and so on. DHK's made it infinitely harder to find people willing to come. Or people would leaving during the raid due to getting DHK's while we were raiding Stormwind.
---
Anyone who has ever tried organizing city raids, or even large redridge raids knows that DHK's are a massive problem. It doesn't seem like a problem with organic wpvp in STV or Ashenvale or whatever, but raids on cities are where the problem gets out of hand.
---
From what Blizzard has said so far, even though they haven't been explicit regarding server pop caps, it's pretty much guaranteed that they are aware just how much of an important factor this is. Personally I'm not worried about this point at all, implementing retro-batching and allowing huge server populations is like baking a delicious, sophisticated cake and then taking a giant shit on top of it as a finishing touch.
---
It's good to keep taking about this until we are certain though, there are still many people in this community who advocate for high server pop caps and we definitely can't allow those voices to exist in a vacuum.
---
There were many issues with server population back in the day - Blizzard was often slow to respond (or didn't respond at all) when it came to people being stuck on "dead" servers, ironically most often after following the game client's "recommend for new players" advice when first creating their characters. That situation sucks, but higher pop caps not only aren't the solution, they also have a profound negative impact on virtually every other aspect of the game. What is needed is for Blizzard to anticipate the population issues that will most definitely happen and be ready with solutions - server merges and free transfers.
---
Now thats a good post.
---
He is excited about the announcement which limited the loot trading
---
I was unemployed at the time, WOW was the only distraction I could afford.
---
13€ for one month of entertainment was the best I have ever found.
---
Making a personal guild bank thoo
---
It was in the game for a short lifespan between 2.0 and TBC release. Maybe that's what you remember. Even before 2.0 patch Shadow Priests where sometimes stacked for Loatheb because of their group healing through Vampiric Embrace. All other healers where only able to cast one healing spell per minute on that fight.
---
Wait do private servers not have the source code?
---
Maybe because pre-bis looks like shit ?
---
And what happens when the retail player base is upset that WoW 2 no longer has the QoL things they love about retail? The people interested in classic and the people interested in retail are interested in two different games. Why merge them? 
---
Should not be that hard. I would do the starting area for orcs so that you are around lvl 5. Then just walk to orgrimmar and take the zeppelin to undercity. You can walk on the road and should not die once. 
---
Then just walk to brill and start questing. 
---
You are a fucking war criminal
---
This is a great point I don't see made often enough. I remember feeling the same way. It felt like it created a larger divide between pvp and pve and made me sad. I love dueling and world pvp so much but I never enjoyed the grind of arenas or bgs to get pvp gear. I just want there to be good gear out there to get from pve and then do wpvp with it. It frustrated me a lot to feel like I was more gimped with my raising gear when I would pvp and go up against resil stacked players. 
---
Drug him with acid or mushrooms, dress up as a night elf druid and convince him that it is his destiny to play WoW.
---
There are several ways to make money by tanking instances. Grab a reliable healer and do Strath runs and reserve the first Righteous Orb to drop for yourself. Later with t0,5 questline you can do 45min Baron runs or DM tribute runs etc.
---
&gt; retty interesting that warlocks have more votes than mages and rogues.
---
meh. they won't last to level 30.
---
Well now I'm just getting more hooked on playing a druid (my old second-most favorite)
---
Depends on what you play. As a mage maybe if he let's you kite. Other than that you get killed on respawn.
---
Elf pirates in space. Why didn't they also just make Spess Mahreens too?
---
You can just ctrl drag mouse to select them... Tho attack move won't work very well.
---
That's why I'm skeptical about  Blizzard. They just keep clicking the big BAN button whenever they don't like something. And even if they like, others will click small REPORT buttons on his right-click menu. Or some bot will trigger some big GOLD SPAM DETECTED procedure.
---
The simpsons predicted classic wow release
---
Same as having an alt but more expensive, also not easy in vanilla to start a guild
---
Stop trolling
---
Yea they are very good. Especially 1v1. 
---
Yes, an RP-PvP server is just a PvP server with "RP" on the label. It does have some harder rules on naming, keeping "IRL" stuff out of say, yell etc. But that has nothing to do with server archistructure. 
---
They can simply just add "RP-" before a PvP realms label and they have given us an RP-PvP realm.
---
I want them to stop adding expansions completely at WOTLK, assuming they're even going to add any expansions. It wouldn't be the end of the world for me if they didnt make separate servers for the expansions, but there are pros and cons to both options. Pros: I wouldn't have to level a new character all the way to 70 or 80 from level 1 each time a new expansion comes out, and itd be easier to stay with your guild/friends. Cons: like you said, if you want the world to stay the same forever if you decided to take a long hiatus from playing, expansions on the same server would kind of ruin that. That's why I want them to stop at wrath, because cataclysm fucking ruined everything and changed the game forever. 
---
One word: Barov Peasant Caller trinket.
---
Have everyone in the raid (except the MT) use it at 35% to summon 117 friendly NPC's that will soak up the poison bolts, then burn the boss without NR gear.
---
I've been intending to play a warrior since forever because it has been my main class from wotlk and onward, but seeing how many warriors there are on these polls makes me worried. The hipster in me is mad. Plus there's the risk for nerfs, I guess.
---
Fuckin awesome. I’m gonna replay the whole trilogy while waiting for classic. 
---
That's awesome news :D thanks for the heads-up.
---
löl I just recalled that it's impossible to do things such as right-click-to-move, right-click-to-attack, drag-to-scroll, rectangle-select units, select more than 4 units, or more obvious RTS features like this.
---
Back then, I didn't even think about that
---
I knew about gog, but oh, I didn't know it was CDProjekt.  Cool!  Also, Warcraft I &amp; II wouldn't run properly for me even back in, I think, Windows XP, so that's really cool if the gog versions are playable in Windows 7!
---
&gt;I highly highly recommend you play WC3 and its expansion instead (not the remastered shit with its altered plotlines and ruined voiceovers)
---
Is it out already?
---
But then don't you think they could get the parameters close enough to make their 'reverse engineered Spell Batching' indistinguishable from Classic WoW Spell Batching?  
---
Perhaps a matter of not being able to know what it is supposed to feel like? It's not as though they have something to work off of.  
---
Hopefully you have an opinion further on the matter, I am interested in what you have to say as it seems like you know what you're talking about.  
---
Thanks!
---
Porque no los dos? You can have your main be your nostalgic rogue, and make as many alts as you want. Or you can main something new, and alt your nostalgia rogue. If you find that the new class isnt what you want, then switch to maining your rogue.
---
The reason for which a mechanic is introduced is not really relevant. Combo's in SF2 were a side effect of another change, arguably a bug, nowadays fighting games revolve around combo's. Super Smash Bros Melee was popular for many many years, arguably outliving even Smash 4. A big part of the reason for that is bugs like Wave Dashing, which were integral to many tricks and the general pace of the game.
---
The origin of a mechanic is really not a factor. Just look at its effects. And as far as I'm concerned, it created many interesting situations and provided further depth for experienced players to master. It's not something confusing or hostile to newer players either, as it's a simple thing to just accept that "stuff can happen simultaneously". Later on, when one becomes more experienced, one can start to figure out the nuance of that and truly master it.
---
...this is my plan too.
---
Yes it matters.
---
Instant attack normalization made it so the dps from AP doesn't get multiplied by attack speed, but the dps from the weapon still does.
---
Instant 2H attack before: total dps * wep speed
---
Now: (wep dps * wep speed) + (AP dps * 3.2)
---
Very simplified formula, you can find the full formula with the AP&gt;dps conversion in google.
---
Conclusion: highest top-end damage weapon will deal more damage with instant attacks.
---
Before normalization, there were weapons with less dps AND less top-end damage that still dealt more damage than other faster weapons. This happened because the attack speed from the "weaker" weapon affected your whole dps from AP.
---
There are other factors too, having a slower MH makes you able to proc crusader more often, as it's pseudo PPM, just a flat proc rate based on weapon speed, and it will proc more often on instant attacks from slower weapons.
---
Some abilities are not normalized: cleave, seal of command, windfury... Those still benefit hugely from slow weapons.
---
I was the only bottomless bag crafter on my server for about 8 months.  Everybody agreed it was outrageous that I'd charge 50g to craft each... yet they all paid it.  =)
---
Lol no they’re not. Warcraft 1 is pretty easy. The hardest bit is the controls.
---
Warcraft 2 is also easy. It only starts getting hard around mission 9-10 of each faction. Even then there are some strategies witch guarantee victory no matter what.
---
Now Beyond the Dark Portal is a different story, but even that is mainly trial and error and doable for an experienced multiplayer gamer.
---
Ele for end game content ??
---
I mean as a mage if you die you have no idea what you're doing.
---
Same goes for a lot of classes against warrior 1v1 though.
---
Obviously assuming equal footing which is a good assumption in classic especially since the TF warrior probably has a lot of consume on him, but I digress.
---
It definitely is expensive but a 1 or 2 tab guild bank would be very worth for those who seek intense organization.
---
10 signatures isn't **that** hard though tbh
---
I fully agree.  Everything presented there are definitely good reasons to me.  The game will feel really cheap if the population cap is too high, so it's safer to keep it the way it is.
---
I don't know who any of these people are.
---
True, Warcraft 1 lacks some standard RTS control features.
---
But, I disliked it for another reason. It is just boring. First thing is that I was never really into orc or human lore, another thing is all the missions are quite relatively simple and mechanics are too.
---
What do you mean exactly by "Game data"?
---
The server cap around 5K feels is the sweetspot for me (vanilla and pserver refference), the world feels alive and still in proportion with the design philosophie. 
---
Sorry, but this is being removed as repost/low-effort. We've had tons of threads like this, not including the weekly "What Should I Play" threads.
---
I don't see this as a solution.
---
Blizz would need to be very fast with this! 
---
There is also a decision to make when a Realm is "low pop" under 1k? 800? 
---
Since the realm transfers are offered for money I don't see free transfers being a thing.
---
It's not as easy as it sounds.
---
Didn't know that either. Now I like both gog and CDProjekt even more haha.
---
The game was never meant to be balanced around 2 or 3 person groups, but arena forced the devs to balance around that. It actually was meant to be balanced around 5 person groups, but the 5's bracket didn't work for other reasons. (i.e. Every decent 5's team needed an Elemental Shaman to burst down one target, which meant that they also needed a Paladin healer because the Paladin can bubble when the other team's Elemental Shaman pops cooldowns, which led to really boring and rigid group comps.)
---
TBC also ruined gear progression. Aside from some trinkets and maybe a few badass weapons, your raid gear in TBC is only useful in raids. On the other hand, your PvP gear is only useful in PvP. You can spend months ranking in arena and earn the best PvP epics in the game, yet once you step into Karazhan you're less powerful than a guy in dungeon blues. That's a bummer.
---
Hi, /u/ZenpaiZenzyg
---
Am I the only one annoyed by all the “am I the only one who is freaking annoyed by all the...”?
---
You can do decent burst combos with Zandalarian Hero Charm (+ Shard of the Falling Star) in combination with Holy Shock, Judgment and Consecration during a HoJ stun. It's pretty situational but will surprise many enemies since they don't expect that amount of burst from a healer.  
---
There are also some niche weapons like  [https://classicdb.ch/?item=21856](https://classicdb.ch/?item=21856) or  [https://classicdb.ch/?item=19852](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19852)  whose lifesteal procs scale with spellpower. They can deliver a lot of burst with lifesteal enchant, shadow oil and holy/reck spec.   
---
Alternative gimmicks:  [https://classicdb.ch/?item=7734](https://classicdb.ch/?item=7734) ,  [https://classicdb.ch/?item=10645](https://classicdb.ch/?item=10645) and  [https://classicdb.ch/?item=9492](https://classicdb.ch/?item=9492)   
---
I've never really experienced any cases, that I can remember, of Spell Batching throughout my time playing WoW. Do you think it should be a feature that private server developers spend time of developing?
---
I completely agree. Let me put a quote here (https://web.archive.org/web/20190202083043/http://forums.crestfall-gaming.com/index.php?/topic/2150-population-cap/):
---
"A higher population doesn't equal to more social interaction. You have tons of players around in todays retail WoW, still everyone is playing for themselves. Because they're not depended on each other. Same principle applies to the world of vanilla. The fewer players are around, the harder do quests get. And the harsher and unforgiving does traversing hostile locations become. Because of this, you really start to appreciate the company of other players.
---
I've played plenty of pre-Cata retail and p-servers with blizzlike caps. Of course it is harder to build a group for specific quests if players aren't just presented to you due to overcrowding. Just waiting for another player close to an elite creature could be very well pointless for hours. But it was this exact reason why my friend list was full of people of my level. So we could contact each other in case of group quests. I was changing zones to help them and they did to help me. Somtimes we even re-did pre-quests together which one side has already completed, so that we both could profit from the task. And it was this adventures and challenges that lead to getting to know each other and to forming friendships.
---
In contrast to this, having too many players around is - for a start - diminishing roleplaying aspects like world building and immersion. I.e. locations loosing their dangerous atmosphere and meaning, due to always having players around steamrolling enemy ranks. So places with a story and certain peculiarities, that you might have struggled with and created memories from, simply turn into just another grinding spot. Plastered with NPC corpses and people farming. More alive, sure. But no longer as authentic, vast and scary.
---
Every zone in the game is more challenging and dangerous if you're approaching it alone. Not pulling too many mobs in buildings/caves, fighting your way in and back out alive from enemy territory, keeping an eye on your cooldowns and HP/mana, not letting them run off into another group when they're low on health. What made vanilla great for many people is trying to survive in this world on their own. Attempting every quest alone, and either improving and succeeding. Or realizing that some task are too much for a sole adventurer. That you're not supposed to do this alone. All of this gets negated and obsolete if you have so many players around that you can just make your way through a cleared path right to the quest target. And if there's no incentive to group up with other people other than being able to tag the mob.
---
Having too many players also can lead to competition, where you start to disparage the presence of other players. Because they're killing your quest mobs and looting your quest items. Just going to the spawn of an elite mob and joining random players by typing "Inv" to quickly kill it doesn't lead to forming bonds. No, this can entirely happen without anyone exchanging a word or emote. But having to actively build that group in town, traveling to your target location together, fighting your way to the elite, maybe even wiping in the process, and finally killing him, did. This is where my most memorable pre-Cata moments come from. Failing a quest over and over, therefore seeking someone who could help me. Finding that person, doing the quest, maybe even fail together. Become friends in the process.
---
Retail Pre-Cata: Me and a friend slowly fighting our way into a scourge base, having to fight our way past zombies and monsters. It did feel like an adventure, because the scourge hordes were dense and one mistake could mean the end of us. No one was hustling or competing with us. It was up to us to infiltrate the base and make it to our target. When we finally arrived at the elite creature, we attempted to kill that thing 5 times. We died, but we tried again. We improved our gameplay. We read into the quest text more and spotted something helpful that we missed. And then we finally did it. It felt epic. It was rewarding.
---
P-Server with non-blizzlike population: Me and a friend go into a scourge base. It's already full of players farming and there are hardly any mobs around. Getting to the elite mob is no problem at all. The elite is dead, there are 3 people waiting for the respawn. We type "Inv" into /say, get invited. We wait until the mob spawns. We kill him in no time. One guy says thanks, everyone immediately leaves the group and we head to our next quest. Not epic. Not rewarding.
---
I've played plenty on &lt;redacted&gt; PvP with their concurrent player count being exactly at 5k. And sure, there are tons of players around and you're joining groups frequently. But it is a lot less personal than it used to be in vanilla retail. And not as rewarding if you don't actively build the groups yourself. The world most certainly feels more alive, but it also feels a lot smaller and cramped. Also non-existent world PvE challenge, broken roleplaying immersion, competing and rushing with other players for quest mobs/targets, joining and leaving groups becomes an unpersonal routine. It's almost like people are just playing for the population hype and not for the game itself."
---
Darkspear fo eva mon! 
---
Do you remember what this was like in Vanilla? Do you remember it failing because allowing transfers from low pop realms is stupid because it further kills said realm.. The only way is to allow transfers TO the low pop realm. But that doesnt work because no one transfers to a dead realm (duh).
---
Its interesting that its so hard to get people to sit down and think about this. If a server is dead at 600... you don't "fix" that by allowing transfers, because xfers are optional. So if theres not 100% xfers of ALL characters on the server then you just end up with a 600 pop server becoming a 300 pop server after half leave for greener pastures... But in the end you still have a dead server to deal with.
---
People do however willingly transfer to other HEALTHY realms. Cap the servers at 6k, if a server somehow loses NO people and is stuck at 6k, then offer xfers off of it to the servers with 2k people.... People WILL LEAVE to go to a healthy 2k server to escape and overly full server. But they will NOT xfer to a dead realm.
---
No in Vanilla you couldn't rez to another graveyard.
---
Going to Tirisfal is not hard : run to Orgri then take the Zep to UC. You will not die once.
---
Yeah, that fits the perception I had back then and the perception I read from other people.  Well, huh, I always figured Naxxramas stood alone in the history of WoW as truly ungodly tuned.  It was probably a little deliberate to hold people until TBC.
---
The cap in vanilla was 4k people:

Thats directly from a developer. If you were on one of the servers that was full all the time, you would have 4k on at a time. IIRC this was raised around TBC launch, but for vanilla 4k was it.
---
So at races limited only to one mount in classic??
---
Are races only limited to one mount in classic??
---
&gt;So they have this idea that it is just so hard and so difficult that all the consumables are mandatory.
---
What? No?
---
The reason you use consumables is because of how stupid amount of character power they give you. Raids on these servers often release with world buffs f.ex disable for the first month anyway so we have room to compare.
---
When you can use consumables to add another 200 spellpower on your 400 spellpower gear kit, 20% crit, 200 attackpower, 10% stats and movement speed, a ton of agility, strength, and every other stat under the sun it makes the content a breeze. It also greatly reduce the risk of people dying when everyone is popping Zanza's or flasks for 50 Stam/1200 extra HP.
---
Not using consumables is simply dumb if you care about clearing content fast. If you dont want to use them thats fine, but then you are back to 5 hour raiding.
---
&gt; what happens when servers cap at 3k then over half of the server consists of "tourists" that leave the server after a month?
---
You will never get an answer to this. The classic community wants (very badly) to pretend that this obvious and completely predictable action won't happen. No one answers it directly. They either just toss snark, or don't answer at all. Its amazing.
---
&gt; Warcraft 1 lacks some standard RTS control features  
---
I mean, it lacks modern ones.  
---
It's nice because it's from before they mangled the lore.  
---
PvP I mostly just raced to demons as orc, but I'm sure that's not optimal.
---
&gt; What would happen when servers were capped at 8k and only 1k left? A horrible experience all around
---
Then you would offer transfers off the 7k server to the many HEALTHY 2-3k servers; and unlike transfers to DEAD REALMS, people would actually do these xfers willingly, because if they dont like crowded zones xferring to a healthy 2k pop would be just fine.
---
Now answer the question he asked to begin with...
---
&gt;Its funny how this has changed, people using consumables were considered low skilled and try hards on my server back in vanilla
---
Must have been a shit server. Using consumables were always considered a good thing where I played. And rightfully so.
---
the only UI in the world to ever track rogue health
---
Shoutout to Reckful
---
God, WC3 Reforged looks awful. The cutscenes look terrible in particular. The animation is rough and is reminiscent of Back at the Barnyard or Jimmy Neutron.
---
The UI looks bad too. What happened to the portraits? The tactile interface? Now it looks sterile and bland.
---
Locust swarm on Anub f.ex deals more or less the exact same damage in Vanilla and Wrath, while tank health improved 3-4x. Go figure.
---
I reeeally don't understand this logic. Let's say 14 people voted shaman. And for the sake of simplicity, say then logically 14 people are going to play shaman in classic. Why make that 28?? I don't get it. Why does faction restriction matter at all? People are voting on what they are gonna play, so there won't be double that number, no?
---
I want authenticity, which means lower populations. Pserver players these days complain about vanilla-esque populations of \~3k as "dead servers". But anything over \~5k felt completely inauthentic and significantly altered the leveling experience which I think goes against the design of Classic and the communication we've had thus far from Blizzard.
---
I'm all for hard server merges. Realm dead? Open free transfers to other realms, or hard merge servers. I wouldn't mind connected realms, as it's functionally a server merge where you get to keep your name, but I can see why people would be jarred and unhappy with that.
---
Most authentic route is &lt;5k population and server transfers/merges for dead realms.
---
&gt;Reply
---
that's titanic leggings not cloudkeeper 
---
Precisely what I'm doing. Priests are the best horde healers (2nd best alliance) and shadow wrecks in PVP.
---
I'm going to be rolling a shaman main on the PvP server that me and my coworkers are likely to be playing on, but I'm strongly considering making an additional Alliance character on a PvE server. I've never been one for PvP and I want some freedom to relax when I feel like doing something else. Playstyle-wise I'm happy with anything other than a druid so long as it's different enough from my shaman and it provides a thoughtful, challenging and especially engaging experience, at least at 60 as I don't mind paladin-style mechanical boredom all that much while leveling. A warrior is kinda what comes to mind, but tanking is a little bit outside my comfort zone and I'm not sure leveling a warrior would be the best idea when I've got 60 levels of kiting as a shaman to focus on already (120 possibly as I'm currently focusing on practicing for the leveling experience by grinding a shaman to 60 on a private server, seeing as I haven't touched vanilla in over a decade).
---
Any suggestions?
---
Why is analdoctor there? What if I’m an analdoctor???
---
All this really changes is that people will coordinate to get the buffs. You still need to flask, it just becomes more of a hassle to do so.
---
Would not mind a guild bank at all. 
---
I mean those who try to push their superiority onto others in a negative manner, their attitude is detrimental to anyone trying to learn and to new players.
---
They're not necessarily the best players, sometimes they just believe they are.
---
Hardcore players who push *themselves* to be the best are not elitists, especially when they take some time to write guides or teach stuff to others, those kind of people are actually key to a healthy community.
---
I found 5k to be a good, playable compromise between vanilla pops and high pserver pops. It still felt "vanilla" but there were plenty of people to group with.
---
What? Hardcore raiders dont raid 3-4 days a week. Casual guilds do.
---
To be fair, Stephen Fucking Hawking is dead, so he knows nothing anymore...
---
I dont see the problem with 3-4 raids a night when you clear faster than a "casual" guild. Casual guilds usually spend a lot more time raiding than hardcore guilds.
---
But they are doing it the authentic way, and them doing that will probably lower their server uptime costs (unless of course it makes the game massively more popular, but that just generates even more profit).
---
You can't just throw money at problems until they go away. You've got to have people who understand the problems, who want to work for you, and who can solve them.
---
Classic UIs are the best. Having the raid twice on the screen just to cover up the screen.
---
Yeah, let's remove an entire server type that was in vanilla because it's apparently "statistically miniscule". Screw authenticity! Female dwarves were 'statical' as well, so let's just remove them altogether too.
---
/s
---
Should probably try to do some fact checking there ;)
---
Pulled Onyxia Whelps
---
D'Oh!!!
---
I only got to "buttnugget" before i cracked up
---
Caps in vanilla were 4k; Proof: https://i.imgur.com/Tfo1QTo.png
---
We already know large percentages of the players in the opening weeks are going to go back to bfa or quit. I vote we don't ignore this fact.
---
First month, higher caps than normal. 6k. Then after the first month, lower the caps to the normal 4k just like classic, and institute login queues. Most of the servers should be well below 4k by 1 month after launch, but those that arent will have a login queue once you lower the cap.
---
Offer the servers with queues free xfers to the few unlucky servers that ended up WAAAAY below 4k (theres bound to be a few emptier servers for sure). People will take a transfer to a server with 2k people, but they wont take a transfer to a server with 500..... The solution is to hopefully never allow any servers to get that low by having initial higher caps, then bringing them down later.
---
I rolled one during vanilla, never again.
---
People really need to read the post before they comment haha
---
You will melt faces as a shadow priest in PVP
---
Then merge dead server with medium pop server.  Calamity avoided
---
The German entries are gold. Abseiler, lmao.
---
Griefing is fun.
---
World PvP dropped dead in TBC and flying was a major factor in that. People would just cc you and try to run far enough away to exit combat and mount up. As soon as they were airborne it didn't even matter if you caught them.
---
Entirely depends on your guild. 
---
In vanilla I raided exclusively as an arms warrior. Looking back I have no idea why I was allowed to, but I was a capable off tank. I guess there was much more ignorance back then. I got myself stronghold gauntlets to save spending dkp on the MC gloves and was at every raid. I basically had enough dkp to ensure I was the first warrior to gain any of the DPS items. Picked up a few unwanted mail pieces here and there as fillers.
---
I remember getting a shout-out on vent during aq progression that the guild leader sometimes questioned why I was allowed in raids as arms, but when he saw me one shot a C'thun tentacle with a sword spec proc he realised that in that situation, I was worthwhile.
---
Just be an active member, be a good person and have a laugh. I was a big personality in the guild, no officer position, but was well respected as the guilds 'poster' warrior. I was even once told by a new warrior recruit that they wanted to be me back in the day, which I find hilarious.
---
The day I got ashkandi from neffy, the guild erupted when they saw the loot notification. I even got whispers from the top guilds to say gz. It wasn't even announced in the usual way for loot distribution, just pinged to my bags. I genuinely think it lifted everyone's spirits. But that was vanilla, it was more about community than the loot, in my experience anyway.
---
What pallys say when you ask them to tank low level dungeons is "lol dude im ret, i can't tank".
---
Turns out Azeroth is in the 40k universe and the Great Crusade has now came across it.
---
The God Emperor is very displeased about psykers running rampant and xenos living alongside humans. 
---
I’ve played wow super casual on and off (haven’t been maxed since cata) and I’m really excited to casually play a huntard mostly for pvp
---
I think this is the entire point of sharding ... initial server "caps" wont be set at 3k, they will be set with a projected medium term population of 2-3k.  This means if they expect tourism/early attrition to be 50% they would have sharding in place to allow for 6k people to start on each server.  Sharding allows the 6k people to play without blocking each other completely on mobs/quest items.  People play their beginner 10-20 levels and realize it is not for them and move on leaving a \~2-4k population for the remainder without sharding at that point.  End result is a "hopefully" stable population around the intended population cap that will probably taper off over time.
---
Until they meet my SL warlock. Then it's all downhill from there!
---
On the flip side, PvPers were probably frustrated before resilience that PvErs were able to come in and destroy them with gear earned outside of PvP.  I enjoyed Vanilla's way of having PvE gear useful in PvP but also having the PvP gear be really good too but the honor grind to get the PvP gear meant that the more casual players who didn't want to raid were kind of screwed out of getting gear to participate in what they enjoyed.
---
I dont understand these posts. Just farm some gold and respec. Why should your guild suffer because you dont want to respec?
---
And the units look huge. A human knight is almost as big as an orc tower, wtf? When i watched the trailer i couldn’t get over how gigantic the units looked.
---
I'm curious, what "graphics additions" are you talking about?
---
As far as I know, there are only two. Improved shadows and the water. (And a higher ground clutter distance but I wouldn't count that as an "addition".)
---
Just wanted to share my experience from a "dead" server. There was about 100players and 1 guild on each faction. When it is that small you know everybody and you become really invested in the other players. Leveling up was great fun. You get to see all the rares and the chests. It becomes you and your freinds against the world.
---
I view my experience on this dead server as the exact opposite of ND 10k+ pop server.
---
Eventually the population dropped from 100 active players down to 25. Not enough to do a dungeon at 60. I stayed and watched new players come and go. The ones that made it to 60 all had made freinds and did dungeons while leveling. So fresh 60s would kinda come in waves of about 2-3 players at a time. Players would not stay long enough to build up a raid group. You get bored because there is no good way to progress your char. 
---
There needs to be atleast enough players around at 60 to progress your character or the population will more or less only be players leveling up. Even with this extremely low pop i got to see all the dungeons and had a great time.
---
Keep in mind this was starting with 100active players and had 25, 8 months later. 
---
I all the time felt if only there had been just a few more players it could have been different.
---
Now if Classic starts with 3-4k i see no problem with 75% drop off. Some servers may be low pop with only 1k but average joe will have a fine time. No worries. There will be multiple raiding guilds but only very few will do Naxx. What happens further down the line can be a bridge we cross when we get there. 
---
Some servers will become popular as Pve or Pvp centrals and those servers are for the hardcore like Monkeynews and such. 
---
Would work fine
---
What do you know? You have no idea how long it's suppose to take to retrofit a legion client into wow classic.
---
Sure they may have underestimated the hype and o ly allowed a small team to work on the project. But, that's what we have now. No reason to continue complaining about that.
---
I prefer blizz to not announce a date too quickly and the game to be release bug free than blizz sticking to a too optimistic date and giving us a game that need shitload of updates. Or worst, blizz postponing the release. 
---
Back in the day we had a somewhat functional wowemu pserver, but it could carry only about 50 players before lag was unplayable (on pretty good hw too) and would crash every 30 minutes or so, rolling your character back minutes if not tens of minutes.
---
We still played the shit out of it. 
---
Not gonna talk about PvE performance because both classes are needed and who cares about dps meters. You just need gear from PvE to compete in PvP.
---
As for PvP, the playstyle of warlock and mage is different. The best is to try them on some instant lvl 60 private server to see for yourself. If you dont want to do that before Classic realease, here's a quick recap:
---
Mage: in 1v1 pvp, as frost spec, you are really good against melee and are decent vs other classes as well. With the right gameplay, you can beat rogues and warriors who totally outgear you, because they simply cannot reach you. Against casters and healers you focus on silencing at the right time and lining up shatter combos and finishing off with instant abilities. If you fail with the timing or press the wrong buttons, you'll likely not have a second chance (e.g. you ice block before blind or silence shadow school on enemy healer priest).
---
In BGs, you are a burst class with many instant abilities to finish off low hp enemies. You can control melees easily (blizzard, r1 frostbolt, frost nova) and can harrass enemy healers (poly, cs). You can escape hot situations with blink and/or ice block. Frostbolt spamming is also decent damage in the zerg fest. You got mana problems in longer fights, if your mana gem and evocation is on cd, no matter what you cant keep on after a given time. You need to blink back and start drinking (even if you healer could have upkept you). If the enemy has a dispeller, you'll be in trouble (freedom and dispell for melees). Enemy shamans are also quite problematic (grounding, earth shock with low cd, dispelling your armor, ice barrier etc.).
---
If you play fire because of later PvE content, you need to respec for PvP (or accept being fire in PvP and every bad thing that comes with it).
---
Warlock: if you play SM/RUIN or SL, the playstyle is a lot more slower and we could say forgiving compared to mage. In 1v1, SM/RUIN has problems with melees, SL is excellent against everyone. Hunters, casters, healers can be all defeated. As a warlock, you are more of a passive guy waiting for the enemy to show his cards (quite oppositve of the mage). You need to have answer for every action the enemy does and this comes down to game knowledge. You have a pet which requires decent pet management from you.
---
In BGs, you either 'tabdot' the enemy, or if they have many dispellers you start doing more direct damage with shadowbolts. SM/RUIN has higher dmg output but more fragile compared to SL but both are good and fun. You need to disrupt enemy healers with fear/coil/curse of tongues. You can have utility with fel hunter (offensive, defensive dispelp and cs) or self-defence with void sac (if you playing a pug BG and care about personal fun). You can also finish of low hp ppl with shadowburn or instant shadow bolts. You will likely be the preferred ranged target of the enemy melee players because you cant really escape the melee, you just stand there and tank them. Because of life tap, if you have healers in the team, you'll drink a lot less than mages.
---
If your guild requires PvE spec for progression, then go for SM/RUIN which is nice in PvP and no need to respec.
---
If you are bored with tabdot gameplay, you can change to destro. That is similar to a fire mage in terms of gameplay with less mobility (you ideally want to CC your enemy then hurl big spells at him and finish of with instants).
---
I think tbc arena (classes and spells are not very far off from vanilla) showed the main difference between the two classes. Mages are the 'active' spell casters, they plan everything ahead, execute it well and burst down the enemy at the right time. If they fail, they either escape and reset or just go down. 
---
Warlocks on the other hand are 'passive' spell casters. They tabdot, start tanking damage and wait for the enemy actions to happen. As soon as the offensive action happens, they play a counter card for it (cs, dispell, changing the curse, coil, fear, shadow ward, pet sac etc etc). Dots will eventually kill the enemy. They have life tap so they continue causing damage as long as they have hp (and their healer has mana).
---
Now, you need to choose. Do you enjoy planning ahead and bursting down the enemy; or do you enjoy dotting up the enemy and waiting for actions to react on. Oh, and you prefer to be better against melee (mage) or against everything else (warlock)?
---
So basically try what they did in vanilla? Which we know didnt work?
---
I thought we were looking for solutions, not trying to repeat the same mistakes? Forced mergers eviscerate communities, upend the entire economy and raiding scenes of the servers involved, and you very **literally** end up feeling like you are playing BFA when thousands of people and dozens of guilds just appear on your server one day.
---
Is community important or not? I mean... lets choose one here..
---
How come Mohammed is banned and Adolf isn't??? Wth is wrong with Mohammed? 
---
We can but hope.
---
I think it looks pretty good, production etc. is nice. However, you have multiple factual errors when talking about mechanics in particular. For instance: Glancing blow occurance vs lvl 63 mobs (i.e. bosses) is 40 %, not 20. Dualwield miss rate is 28 % vs 63 mobs not 17.  
---
This is extremely misleading and contradicts the entire point of your video.
---
&gt; It actually was meant to be balanced around 5 person groups, but the 5's bracket didn't work for other reasons. (i.e. Every decent 5's team needed an Elemental Shaman to burst down one target, which meant that they also needed a Paladin healer because the Paladin can bubble when the other team's Elemental Shaman pops cooldowns, which led to really boring and rigid group comps.)
---
Which kind of shows that it couldn't really be balanced around 5s.  2v2 and 3v3 were ways that individual players could really show how good they are.  Yeah, some comps were just outright better than others but getting nuked in BGs by warriors backed by a bunch of healers didn't feel like you got outplayed, you just got out-warrior/healered (if that makes sense).
---
&gt; You can spend months ranking in arena and earn the best PvP epics in the game, yet once you step into Karazhan you're less powerful than a guy in dungeon blues. That's a bummer.
---
Well in Vanilla you could spend a long time ranking but if there were people who just played more than you (not necessarily better at the game) then you might never get the r12 and r13 epics, let alone the r14 weapons.  Or you could raid, which if you preferred PvP meant you were almost forced to do something you might not have wanted to do.  I'm by no means saying the TBC system was perfect but it allowed a compromise for people to focus on the aspect of the game they enjoyed more and actually get gear from it (without having to dedicate an obscene amount of time to do it).
---
The usual way; 10% will continue to bitch about classic, the other 10% will stick up for classic and the other 80% won't give a shit, keep quiet, and continue playing retail because they enjoy it more then classic.
---
Anything gnome is always a no for me. Gnomes were a mistake.
---
Stick to whatever the cap was in vanilla and merge servers as needed (literally merge them, instead of feathermoon and kul-tiras you merge them into kul-tiras/feathermoon). Sharding isnt there to help with the pop cap, it's there so that when we have hundreds of people trying to kill mobs in anvilmar we can actually kill the mobs. 
---
Increasing server caps is a bad plan because it necessitates increased spawn rates not only of mobs but gathering nodes, which in turn devalues cloth, bags, ore, and herbs.
---
Considering how they are thinking about using sharding in starting areas only this approach would make the most sense for what they are likely attempting to do.  We won't know for sure until release(or more info given) but they have already acknowledged tourism problems, potential use of sharding, estimated population cap for non-dynamic server, and I am sure they are aware of how terrible dead servers are.  Wrap it all together and it seems like they will be trying to use sharding to offset a higher than normal starting population with the intent to deliver a healthy max level population.  Guess we will see ...
---
Because people are overly sensitive.
---
Well it requires you to stick around a major city for quite some time to find people, plus the required gold, a lot of people is going to be rushing through content or in a guild already at launch so not many potential targets.
---
Also when you title your video "Everything You Need to Know" ... you really should know what you are talking about. My impression is you have far from enough experience or knowledge of fury warriors to even be making this kind of video. I understand you want to make guides, however pay attention to the importance of the quality of the content and do the necessary research if you lack the knowledge.
---
Who is gummy 
---
Alleria was the first server I ever played on. I was only on it a year before switching to Mal'Ganis but I have some great memories. This is trippy I see some familiar names including Apollion.
---
This would be the best way for sure. If Blizzard made just a couple of high cap servers. 1 for each ruleset, then let the other servers be normal 4k cap servers.
---
I would absolutely kill for them to do this. As it would play out just like retail did in a way, with all the people who say they love small servers eventually xferring over to Stormrage where all the action is later in the games life.
---
Nothing kills an mmo like a lack of people. In the end, the larger communities always thrive.
---
That's pretty much moonglow druid spec. I suggest using that build instead.
---
You'll mostly be spamming chain heal, so healing way's value is diminished unless you're specifically assigned to heal tanks.
---
IIRC, purification only affects the base healing of spells so it's a nice bonus but won't affect much compared to just getting better gear.
---
Lastly, as a shaman you will be put in the tank/melee group and the only one benefitting from mana tide will be you. If you are stocked with mana pots and runes, you really don't need mana tide at all.
---
So it's a viable build but if your group intends on putting you in a caster/healer group or assigning you to focused spot heals, you'll want 31 points in resto.
---
As a Warlock - yes please.
---
I was going to roll femtroll until I remembered this was the abomination
---
Sick binds
---
Funny thing is this is one of the best healing specs. With this you can heal in all raids. Good job. You might be asked to get improved mark but no biggie really.
---
&gt; They act like it's a major gameplay mechanic they can play around when it's really just coincidental scenarios a large majority of the time that make no sense for a decent video game.
---
For a lot of people maybe, but with low ping people got good enough to semi-reliably do some cool stuff like vanishing another rogue's blind, vanishing deathcoils, etc.  In TBC I remember being able to shadowstep a warriors intercept (which was huge because warriors just deleted rogues) and I could do it like 90% of the time mainly because warriors are so damn predictable on when they'll intercept.
---
You seem very defensive at anyone even remotely implying you didn't play vanilla retail..
---
I honestly don’t see it as induced lag. I see it as a form of turn based combat where if both individuals click their attacks at the same time, they both go. It’s kind of beautiful really 
---
15 was the starting level In classic and starting zones weren’t introduced until WotlK 
---
This is going to be the official release. Also content will just be scaled down to level 19. It's just easier that way. Less zones etc. 
---
/signed
---
This won't be viable at the start of the server but once Dire Maul comes out you will just go in there and farm the lasher packs with Holy Nova, Priest is one of the easiest classes to do it with.
---
Some private servers intentionally nerf Dire Maul and put changes into the dungeon to make it hard to farm solo because of how much it breaks the economy on a server, since the lasher farming method introduces so much gold that otherwise would be harder to get.
---
Does it play well on W10? Ive tried to play WC2 on DOSbox etc but it plays horribly.
---
Most is skipped anyway
---
They are replacing Ragnaros as the final raid boss with Hogger.
---
I recall being unable to name my guild "Black Morass Defenders"
---
Not sure if it's because of black, or because of mor-ass
---
Yes, that demo was the whole game and it will be the same with the final release but Deadmines will be included now.
---
Yes, that demo was the whole game and it will be the same with the final release but DM will be included now.
---
Also, Gargamel was definitely reserved
---
Hornytauren. Not Hornyhuman, Hornyelf, or Hornygnome. Nope, just Hornytauren is on there.
---
Was this a private server? If so, that experience isn’t transferable to classic. The reason you could find groups at all times there, was because all servers were hosted in EU/Russia, forcing US/Australia to play there.
---
Just had a flashback to many, many years ago - a guildmate wanted to change his name from Ephixi to something else so one of my friends reported his name to a GM saying it meant horsefucker in her language. She got a three day ban.
---
Its not the community that's the problem, they were having a joke and you got very defensive.
---
You're the sort of guy who comments on the forums about Naxx changes when you never stepped foot in Naxx.
---
it seems to be 3-5 days per factor discussed
---
Though, I want... well, not release date. The actual release!
---
~8 years across three different companies with multiple shipped online games, first as QA while younger and these days as software developer. I know most people here on reddit are young and naive but a lot more work and design thought goes into these decisions than you all seem to think.
---
Helps with the community aspect of the game, certain guilds can level up in different zones, whichever they like. For example my guild will primarily roll in Deadwind pass, we will make our hub there.
---
Demo was actually an Uncut release. Production will have westfall flat. And no elf ears. 
---
First, give me PVP servers. Or at least the date when they come.
---
I think the thing that makes people ask that a lot is the time investment. Classic rewards those who spend time and energy and a lot of people don’t have as much time to play as they’d like or they used to, w/e. So the thought of “making the wrong decision” but not realizing it til level 43 a few days/weeks after launch would devastate a lot of players.
---
Yeah, i try to take most needed raid talents, but what about solo farm and pvp? 
---
And I always thought that was an incredibly poor comparison. Grinding bear butts for 1.5 hours in WoW is in no way comparable to a good 1.5 hour movie.
---
You need to compare like-for-like. As far as gaming goes, WoW is decent value, but you can get much better (e.g., some people have put in as many hours into minecraft as others into WoW, and minecraft is a single purchase).
---
Right, but obviously if you have 50k active people on a server compared to 25k, getting a group on a weekday morning is going to be twice as easy, right? There won't be any australians, but there will still be way more players.
---
Oh you're the kind of person who thinks they should just re-release the 1.12 client because it's already their old game, right?
---
Yeah I can tell you have never written a line of code in your life.
---
Am I missing something here? What about servers that fill up in 2 weeks? You can't just halve the player cap on a full server. I get that people might quit quickly but Blizz can't/won't move characters around that quickly even if they aren't being played.
---
Ofc, no one is disputing that. If vanilla cap was 4K, I wouldn’t be against a cap similar to what Nostalrius had.
---
its because the classic team is not the main bulk of blizzard. classic wow is a side project made by devs who actually enjoy vanilla wow and are legitimately passionate about recreating a fun game in the most authentic way possible. thats what blizzard used to be; passionate devs making fun games that they actually want to play.
---
Which had very likely been the case at Blizzard for years. People forget they are gamers at heart too, and many of them grew up playing the Blizzard classics such as vanilla. This is a "passion project", no doubt.
---
Don't listen to everyone, they're trolling. This won't be the starting zone and you won't start at level 15.
---
The starting zone is Ragefire Chasm and you start at level 60.
---
This is exactly why they're doing sharding the first few weeks.
---
Can anyone break down the Warrior crit cap math particularly in regard to PvP?
---
I agree with this. All I want is action of some sort to be taken to prepare for the population drop off. I wish more people wanted the same.
---
IMO, 5-6k cap would be ideal as off peak times could still have 2-3k on high pop servers. 
---
For low population servers I think the least intrusive way would be to merge servers with similar or opposing faction balances. This way relationships and reputations will still be maintained amongst your already formed community, but you’ll have to get to know new people
---
Most of the guilds I was in up through naxx used them sparingly.  Tanks might use titans, I always had mongoose for my hunters or mana pots/demonic runes(really early on) for my priest, and everyone had greater protection potions for key fights but otherwise ... not much.  I think Rag, Vael, Huhu, Patch were the only fights where increasing your DPS by an extra 2% might make the difference for vanilla raids that I did.  Otherwise most wipes were caused by mechanics problems and poor internet/idiots.
---
You're not reading that correctly. He says the cap was "more or less" 3k, but the hardware could manage up to 500-1k more.
---
Yeah I won’t mind sharding the initial zones as majority of tourists will simply give up once they realise it will take them 2-3 hours to hit level 10
---
Yeah. Kinda died out when FTH and Prophecy left the server. Shame.
---
Is stance dancing really necessary if you want to be good at PvP?
---
Never had much gear with spell dmg so i mainly supported with heals in pvp. This worked but you are a really squishy healer. Tauren stun helped me alot tho. Moonfire + insect swarm into bear/cat form can handle most things 1v1. Really did miss the Feral charge though. 
---
Solo farm felt bad, cat was more effective even with no talents for it. I did tank 5man dungeons as this spec aswell. No problem epic healing gear has good armor. 
---
absolutely. I specifically remember my guild requiring every single member to have certain fire resist (not just few pieces either a decent amount). Unless private servers have some things wrong which they definitely could, I don't think non tanks need any
---
This
---
You can also melt faces in endgame raids if you've got a strong rotation game.
---
Any class can solo old content up to a point, SM included. Some are just better than others at it. I always had fun in Vanilla boosting guild friends with my hunter.
---
Undead rogues represent 99% horde pop of PVP server. The other are just banks :o
---
\-sigh- Trolls everywhere. But on a serious note. They only showed Westfall for the Demo. When classic hits you start in Lordaeron before the fall and Arthas. Real Classic. No Undeads btw. They will come later and you will have the chance to get infected or not. 
---
Maybe a BG that you queue into and drop into your fort, recapture it and gather resources to build it back up to try take out the other factions fort but the twist is it’s not really a BG because the opposing faction is comprised solely of NPC’s
---
Oh Wait ...
---
They can tweak shard sizes (if too many people leave) and realm cap through queues (if not enough people leave) to nudge population where they want. It's obviously not foolproof, but it is by far the mechanic which will give them the largest degree of control over the server population.
---
Can't wait to level up in the same places with the same people with the same guide!
---
Please let's just upvote this because a question like this can't be serious.... god where has all the intelligence gone to...
---
I don’t want classiccast as my filter, as much as I enjoy watching. 
---
Do you think he will release his alliance speedleveling guide before classic drops? 
---
Horde will start in Desolace as level 14, level capped at 18. This has something to do with server balance (80-20 Horde/Alliance). Level in a tougher zone, with a lower level cap makes PvP more balanced. 
---
3 days and 22 hours? I'm thinking it might be incorrect private server xp values then. Because that's almost twice as fast as Joanna's actual world record.
---
I think this is the solution:
---
While there's no way to merge servers with zero impact to the community, here's a way it can be done with almost no impact.
---
Servers at launch are given a cluster number. Clusters are setup by region and a number of servers (say maybe 10-20 servers) are included in each cluster. The only relationship these servers have with one another is that they're in the same region.
---
When players create a character or a guild, the availability of the character name or guild name is checked across the entire cluster. If the name is taken anywhere in the cluster the name is available to no one else in the cluster.
---
For the sake of this discussion let's assume Blizzard goes with classic-authentic populations of 2500. Once two servers within the same cluster drop below player peaks of 1000 to 1200 those two servers are permanently merged.
---
Server names aren't changed. Player names aren't changed. Guild names aren't changed. You still log into Laughing Skull and this other guy still logs into Mal'ganis. You both end up in the same Azeroth.
---
Though I think you're reading the image wrong (as mentioned in another comment, no point discussing that here too), this is pretty much Blizzard's exact plan with sharding. Sharding lets them have a much higher population cap initially, that they can decrease over time.
---
&gt; Increasing server caps is a bad plan because it necessitates increased spawn rates not only of mobs but gathering nodes 
---
This won't be the case because we get sharding? 
---
&gt; when we have hundreds of people trying to kill mobs in anvilmar 
---
I don't think that sharding will only last till anvilmar. Do you have a source for that? I thought they said sharding will be a thing from 1-19. 
---
&gt; which in turn devalues cloth, bags, ore, and herbs. 
---
I don't expect a stable economy for the first few weeks, since everybody who is interested in PvP will get mining/eng and all money people will get herbalism
---
You sit in frost nova without an escape and mage is casting frostbolt for 1000dmg? This is now 900 dmg due to def stance.
---
You see the melee enemy has a glow to his weapon? Switch to defstance and disarm.
---
You popped sweeping strikes in battle stance and want to dish it out to 4+ opponents? You switch to bersi stance and whirlwind.
---
Warlock is about to fear you? Bersi stance -&gt; zerker rage.
---
Yes, stance dancing is absolutely necessary and you will do it aaaaaall the time. I have battle stance on mouse wheel up and bersi on mouse wheel down to quickly use it all the time.
---
Maybe it's just me but if attacks go off at the same time then it's pretty logical both would hit xD.
---
Play a tank : we will need a lot of casual tanks to run through dungeons. There are too much tanks for raids and not enough for 5 man content.
---
I loved 5 man healing on my alt priest however I don't think I would have enjoyed healing a raid.
---
Here is a famous tanking guide back in the day. He explains some of these mechanics in detail. I remember they often separated the good and mediocre tanks with positioning. 
---
https://youtu.be/KmOPuziOWuA
---
&gt;Raid team consisting of both a shaman and a paladin
---
Hissss
---
He said they are already done :) just tweaking and testing them. They are released at classic beta or just before launch.
---
Here I sit broken hearted, need a date, to be anounced.
---
Guess I am going to integrate those into my spell binds somehow. Thanks!
---
Wow.... you convinced me to accept this. It's the best solution I've read so far.
---
Well done Dr. Professor.
---
The guy knows absolutely nothing about vanilla. 
---
He never even got to 60.
---
Its 1d faster than the original record.
---
cursed image 
---
Had 800 fishing and 800 archeology within 8 hours of Legion release. They did removed the First feast of strenght so I was the only idiot going for it.
---
Not sure if I was world first but big chance I was.
---
From 0:00 till 4:00 fishing on release night. After that straight into archology.
---
I dont know why I did that eigther.
---
5k cap, after the retail guys quit it will drop to around 3.5-4k. Leaving a healty base and room for even more to quit and still be a playable.
---
Yapper looks like a lost kid at a fair.
---
The incorrect XP values on private servers have been fixed for a long time now. Is it that hard to believe that he's just optimized his route and has gotten significantly better at the game?
---
Yeah, I agree with that division, I think WoD felt like an transition period in between the Cata school of WoW design and then the even more modern Legion school. I think the Cata era still had a lot more attention into developing challenging and interesting raid and dungeon content, and people may hate on MoP, but most will call out its great raids / fights, good class design, and really intricate quest / world zones. 
---
All the "popular" private servers have DOUBLE rested XP generation to vanilla. 
---
Some of my Favorits
---
Ashenvale: bears and deers for meat and skins
---
Stonetalone: venture co goblins
---
STV: venture co for pages of the books, cats for meat and raptors for the lore
---
Shimmering Flats: insects for first mount gold
---
Lower Feralas: bears and wolves for tender wolfsteaks and skins
---
Aszhara: Nagas for green drops
---
STV Jaguero Isle: lvl 51 cats and gorillas and a chest, many green drops, nice round, easy 20g/h
---
The reason for lack of complaining in BfA have nothing to do with the game being improved.
---
It's just that the only players left in BfA are the brain-dead ones.
---
I'm super impressed with the level of authenticity blizzard is going for!
---
This is one of my most valued mechanics of vanilla, it would just not be the same without it.
---
Good job blizzard!
---
More like they will be a walking battlefield. Their gang vs stream snipers
---
I hope everyone follows the route 110% so i can go anywhere else.
---
I think it's because of black. I found an RP guild recently who said they had to do black-something because black alone was seen as offensive.
---
O RLY?
---
No. He's just of the mindset that old thing = good and new thing = bad.
---
#nochanges, except the stuff I don’t like
---
&gt; This won't be the case because we get sharding? 
---
&gt; I don't think that sharding will only last till anvilmar. Do you have a source for that? I thought they said sharding will be a thing from 1-19. 
---
&gt; I don't expect a stable economy for the first few weeks, since everybody who is interested in PvP will get mining/eng and all money people will get herbalism
---
With sharding you still only have 3k people online. Same number of mobs will be killed, the chests, ore and herbs will be slightly higher than they should but it won't be like on private servers where all the nodes are on a 6 minute timer because theres 10k people on the server trying to get it.
---
Anvilmar was just an example, they implied it would only be for the low level zones where everyone is bottlenecked. So for me that means anvilmar and dun morogh.
---
Server mergers are way better for the longevity of the game than inflated pop caps
---
I understand all but windfury. 
---
Wouldn't faster attack speed mean more frequent procs, resulting in equal dps boost compared to slow heavy hitting weapon? Or does windfury have a cooldown that prevents it from proccing frequently with higher attack speeds?
---
well if we are getting the modern client the modern list of names will be banned.
---
i know they added names for some modern npcs that wont even exist
---
I hope they realise the endless rng and luck and never be done farning isn't a good thing for an mmorpg. 
---
I want to farm 1 thing for a week, be done with it and than farm the next thing untill Ive farmed all possible things and feel like Ive acomplished something.
---
I dont want to farm all things at the same time for eternity.
---
Soon they will only have the "but private servers are free" mantra at their disposal.
---
He re-did alot of the guide and he said he is more knowledgeable and better at the game now.
---
Very strong 1v1, slightly weaker than SL warlock but not by a ton, best dispel in the game, good melee damage resistance mana burn is pretty awesome vs healers, fear is undispellable (although still breakable via wotf, trinket, beserker rage), can heal in dungeons while leveling easily.
---
Downsides, extremely mana hungry, short range on mind flay, have a ton of buffs you need to reapply on death in BGS (which hurts their mana even more), kinda weak in group pvp (not typically desired in premade pvp at all), extremely hard to find a raid spot as shadow. Did I mention extremely mana hungry, because no joke you will be out of mana all the time, viper sting makes your life a literally hell and you can't do anything about it.
---
Ofc the guild bank should have bag slots too. Everyone will STILL have their bank alts. Its just for collecting the valuable items so they can be accessed by the officers without sharing account information.
---
It really is this simple: 1.0-1.12.1 is fair game to be discussed. 
---
Everything that comes after can get stuffed and is not up for discussion.
---
You want to be hand held by the game? You go to addon sites and download the babysitter yourself. Easy as that.
---
It seems you're right, I though the difference was bigger.
---
Classic is gonna be a hoot 
---
I mean I feel pretty frustrated about Lore's lack of you know idea of the community impression - At least I hope afterwards he had something from one of the CM's or the Observers about the interest in it.
---
Its his job to feel out the community, though I guess many of us don't feel he even deos that.
---
When you get stunned in Vanilla, you get stuck in the exact same position until the stun ends.
---
E.g. if you jump off a cliff and a warrior charges you, then you will be stunned in midair until it wears off.
---
It means that you will not be able to jump away from a stun, but if you can get enough height (jumping off elevation) then you can avoid the warrior since he can't reach you.
---
Sometime in TBC or Wotlk it got changed so you still preserved your momentum after a stun landed, which led to everyone trying to jump just before they got stunned.
---
For example, you could jump off the bridge in blade's edge arena just as a rogue is doing a kidneyshot on you. Another is jumping behind a pillar LoS just as a warrior charges you.
---
It's a different mechanic and got changed yet again in the future, so you would stay in the same place but also drop down to the ground as you got stunned. It's the current WoW implementation.
---
I love that this has NSFW flair lol
---
Your picture is not accurate, everybody will be dwarf or UD ;-)
---
&gt;So basically try what they did in vanilla? Which we know didnt work?
---
but thats not what they did. in vanilla they kept offering free transfers from high pop -&gt; low pop which didnt work.
---
&gt;It definitely is expensive but a 1 or 2 tab guild bank would be very worth for those who seek intense organization.
---
You get free tab and 16 slot bag on each char created and 5minute run to the city. They could add the guild bank as something you can buy and put the cost so high that it wouldnt be a "good" option to bank alts.
---
Like 100/500/1000g.
---
Need a date so I can book leave before that cunt Steve takes that time off for his dumb trip with his wife
---
What would you consider the best in terms of a support class healer/ hybrid?
---
Ooooo what's happening on April 1st? 
---
He was going to host a BC private server but it got cease and desist by blizzard. I think he had a terminal illness or something. But it was a very blizzlike server and he made it all by himself. You could look up gummy’s bc server
---
was working on a hyped TBC server (not corecraft) when apparently people in suits showed up to his house with a cease and desist letter
---
I can relate to this. There's just so much to get excited about, because even the smallest things matter in the end! Finding something like a node of Swiftthistle is a dopamine explosion.
---
I don't mean to derail, but this is a feeling I don't get in retail anymore due to the ever looming new content patches and catch-up mechanics just around the corner.
---
Same. I didn't even play on Nost but my brother sent me the petition link. A former Blizz employee who worked on vanilla back in the day cosigned it, iirc. 
---
Yea! And when warriors charge each other they pass by each other?! I think it’s cool and immersive if anything
---
But we’re F5ers, most people don’t know too much :)
---
Enchanting has hella value later on, though. Greater Eternal Essences and Large Brilliant Shards always go for a lot.
---
Troll. They have the best tusks. 
---
Then imagine both intercepting at the same time and passing each other again lol.
---
&gt; A lot of players want 3k, 4k, 5k or even 10k+ caps 
---
And that is because they have no idea what the implications for a high concurrent player cap will be in Classic.
---
The realm population is a no brainer and a done deal for Blizzard. It will be in Classic as it was in Vanilla. There is no ifs or buts here.
---
One of the MAJOR components of Vanilla game design was realm population. The game was DESIGNED to properly work within certain parameters. And one of those parameters was realm population.
---
I have no doubt that Classic realms will have Vanilla realms population.
---
really, not played wow for years but i remember dur8ng wod or something there was a few months or weeks after a patch where the filter got disabled.
---
i was able to snag shaman / wow and a bunch of good names on my server
---
Kr0n0s wouldve been just as popular, Nost just stole the fame by releasing their buggy ass core a month earlier.
---
Like AVWoW said, *any* class can solo old old content (low level dungeons) *up to a point*. Mages can do pretty sweet AoE stockades and such I suppose (Alliance only though), which is pretty fast exp around level 20 or so.
---
If you want to push it as far as possible I'd say Hunters and Druids could, like Paladins, do pretty well too.
---
On a sidenote: I even remember being boosted by a 60 warrior friend in Uldaman (thats level 40+ or so IIRC, higher than SM) and it was pretty easy. Only last boss was a bit risky because I had no way to heal him up.
---
And when classic launches, it will be warrior/hunter/mage... like always. 
---
Which does not affect Joana's speedrun since he doesn't get rested.
---
jfc the posts these days
---
Alliance. He's trying to convince me that we should play horde this time though. 
---
Servers will not cap at 3k during launch. Or 10k. It will be closer to 20k. Tourists will be playing only during launch.
---
Sharding at launch will make sure once the tourists are gone and most casuals will enter normal gaming mode, the 2,5-3k cap will be in effect.
---
But by that time, the realm population will settle at around 10k total players and under 2.5k concurrent players.
---
Everyone plays as a kobold and you have to take candle
---
Just like you gain points in AB but it’s a free-for-all across the whole of Azeroth and it’s ongoing forever 
---
Also the time where people got their super powerful last talents, epic PvP gear buyable with honor and marks instead of needing a rank.
---
Pretty much everyone got a huge power boost in the pre-patch
---
Figured so, was more commenting that all XP is fixed in private servers. When clearly rested is left as non-vanilla like numbers. 
---
So he played for 3 days 22 hours straight?
---
I would love to try an RPPVP server it sounds so fun, but I love dumb names too much
---
it has very little to do with clearing content fast. good guilds would clear content fast anyways and if you spend 30minutes fully buffing then save 30minutes from raid, did you really save any time?. 
---
try hards only world buff for dick measuring and rankings and because it is more FUN.
---
i watched a video where raid would go out of raid, world buff, then go back for each KT attempt
---
what you mentioned basically allows raids who are subpar to clear content they could not clear otherwise.
---
Of course you clear faster. But people have these consumables as mandatory. There are tons of threads in here claiming you need every buff under the sun to clear naxx and AQ which simply isn't true.
---
There's a difference between the statement consumables makes you clear faster vs consumables are required to complete the content. And many guilds believe you cannot clear stuff without it, I've been in them.
---
Yeah, that keeps getting tossed around from time to time.  The numbers are definitely not THAT close, but for them to even be remotely relevant does say something about the ungodly tuning Naxxramas had, arguably higher than anything else in WoW since.
---
Some example comparisons: (to 25-player)
---
Loatheb:
---
* In Classic, Inevitable Doom from is 2550 damage after 10 secs in Classic after.  In Wrath, it's 5000 damage after 10 secs.
---
* In Classic, each healer can cast 1 healing spell every minute and raids had something like 8-10 healers.  In Wrath, they can heal an unlimited amount for 3 seconds every 20 seconds and raids had something like 5-6 healers.
---
Grand Widow Faerlina:
---
* In Classic, Poison Bolt Volley hits 10 closest people for ~1450 damage and ~450 per 2 secs for 8 secs, stacking to 3.  In Wrath, it hits 10 closest people for ~3750 damage and ~2000 per 2 secs for 8 secs, stacking to 3.
---
* In Classic, Rain of Fire hits for ~2000 damage every 2 secs for 6 secs in a 10y radius.  In Wrath, it hits for ~4000 damage every 2 secs for 6 secs in an 8y radius.
---
Thaddius:
---
* In Classic, Chain Lightning hits for ~2000 damage to 15 targets.  In Wrath, it hits for ~7500 to 8 targets.  To be clear, most healers had actual AoE healing capabilities by Wrath.
---
* In Classic, opposite polarity hits for 2000 damage in a 13y radius.  In Wrath, it hits for 4500 in a 13y radius.
---
Four Horsemen: (now here's where things get interesting!)
---
* All Marks: In Classic, they all deal 0/250/1000/3000/5000/6000/7000 damage, starting at 20 secs in then every 12 secs after and last for 75 secs.  They have varying radiuses, noted below.  In Wrath, they all deal 0/500/1500/4000/12,500/20,000/21,000 damage, starting at 24 secs in then every 12 secs after and last for 25 secs.  They also have varying radiuses but all considerably smaller than in Classic, noted below.
---
* Mograine/Rivendare: In Classic, Mark radius is 70y.  In Wrath, it is 55y.  In Classic, Righteous Fire is a 25% chance to deal 2160 Fire damage and 600 every second for 8 secs.  In Wrath, Unholy Shadow is a 25% chance to deal ~5000 Shadow damage and 1500 every second for 8 secs.
---
* Korth'azz: In Classic, Mark radius is 65y.  In Wrath, it is 55y.  In Classic, Meteor does ~15K damage split.  In Wrath, it does ~50K damage split (to be fair, number of people for a raid dramatically affects the tuning of split-damage attacks).
---
* Blameux: In Classic, Mark radius is 65y.  In Wrath, it is 45y.  In Classic, she melees like normal, and Void Zone is 4000 damage per second, cast every 12 secs, and lasts for 90 secs.  In Wrath, her melee attack is completely replaced with a 2 sec Shadow Bolt that hits for ~9000 damage to the nearest target so that anyone can tank her, and Void Zone is 4250 damage per second, cast every 15 secs, and lasts for 75 secs.
---
* Zeliek: In Classic, Mark radius is 70y.  In Wrath, it is 45y.  In Classic, he melee likes normal, and Holy Wrath hits for ~550 damage with a 5y chain range, damage doubling for each person hit, supposedly only targets tank (?), and is cast every 12 secs.  In Wrath, his melee attack is completely replaced with a 2 sec Holy Bolt that hits for ~9500 damage to the nearest target so that anyone can tank him, and Holy Wrath hits for ~3000 damage with a 10y chain range, damage increasing by 50% for each person hit, and is cast every 15 secs.
---
So no, Wrath's Naxxramas numbers are all at least a little over double that of Level 60 Naxxramas numbers, and they basically need to be for any proper tuning, even considering the fact that Wrath raids were fairly undertuned outside of hard modes.
---
Perhaps people are comparing to 10-player Naxxramas numbers.  Those would of course be considerably closer, but even then, I assume they'd still likely be at least 50% higher.
---
Goebbels is there too. 
---
Thanks! =)
---
You will melt faces as a shadow priest in pvp.
---
The quest xp on lighthouse is higher than vanilla at least on nirthdale release. When you compared the quest turn in xp rate to videos of joanna speed run PS quest xp turn in was tbc version.
---
Realistically, at what level will it be possible to obtain Whirlwind Axe as a horde warrior attempting to speed level to 60 on release ? What are any viable, alternative axes? Should we even been trying for WW axe if we rushing to 60? Most people say it’ll last you to mid 50s or even 60, so it seems like a reasonable time investment once you’re around 40 and can bring a friend along. 
---
I was planning to do the same after I "quickly" played through Fallout 4.
---
I'm 60 hours deep...
---
Hopefully there's enough time lol
---
instructions unclear, dick stuck in keyboard
---
The answer is the same one they used over a decade ago when some servers had dying populations: offer realm transfers. Nobody is "pretending" this isn't an issue, they just know it has a solution.
---
I’d write my own honestly.  The issue is people don’t want the 1.0-1.12.1 UI.  They want some developed from scratch concept of LUA they have where the only macros that work are the ones they want and everyone else can go spin on their thumb, because most people don’t have a wide enough view of what every class was like to play.  Things like decursive that allegedly trivialized debuffs, but then just will not hear the idea that mouseover should be included if you broke that because otherwise you just added a huge lag time to healers who have gone from “position the mouse and click a button” to “position the mouse, click the unit frame, then press another button to cleanse”, which has NEVER been necessary to do.
---
May I file a little complaint due to every information (which btw is fairly correct) being in a separate page with ads?
---
A favoured tactic of mine as a NE Hunter was FD, Shadowmeld, pop an Invis pot, and move somewhere else. Do it quick enough and the trap animation wouldn't play properly and you'd be perfectly set up to either make a run for it while they look for you or get back out to range to hit them again from an unexpected direction.
---
Ill try to remember look it over. We had this thing in private server where the classleaders wrote a tutorial focusing on the most important parts for their own class to possible recruits (that might have played a different class before).
---
I was the CL of priests and did write a guide of my own. It wasnt with pretty pics and nice formatting. :P
---
It was probably one of the best servers in Europe up until AQ where a lot of guilds transfered away due to lag. It had Curse and Nilbog on it and like 5-6 guilds that were in the top race in BWL but sure, trash server. The next server we went to had Paragon on it, but sure trash server.
---
Consumables were considered a crutch and were used sparingly. Titans on tanks and protection pots on certain fights, maybe dps popped an elixir but that was pretty much it.
---
I want 5k plus.
---
3k and servers will be wastelands with no raids possible after a month.
---
Yeah same for me.
---
As a warrior would you guys suggest gear first (lion helm and devil set) or epic mount first?
---
Everyone who gets banned from the forums or the game had it coming, if they for some reason don't they can always appeal with blizzard and will be unbanned with game time restores.
---
YA RLY
---
This is the easiest issue to please everyone with, and doesn't need to have one set result.
---
Just have servers with "authentic" amounts, and some high cap servers.
---
10-12k is too many, but 5-7k just feels bloody amazing and given the option I would absolutely choose a higher cap server, ore and herb rates be damned, IDGAF the world is just so fun when it's buzzing.
---
Thanks for actually contributing, brother!
---
You still need to explain how the rest of the post (that you clipped away) isn't calamity by definition.
---
Slapping 3 realms together, tossing everyones names into the air, eviscerating 3 economies and merging them into a frankenstein while guilds all get renamed, the raiding and PvP scene get whirlwinded and you are suddenly playing with strangers BFA style as your friends list becomes useless doesnt sound at all like the "Community is first" mantra I see paraded around here. 
---
If you are soloing the quest everything is doable at 30 if you know how to hamstring kite except killing the Thundering Exiles. Thundering Exiles become very easy at 36 when you get access to pummel.
---
I believe the most important factor for the server caps isn't rather the total online player cap but a cap that forces balance between the numbers on each faction online at any one time.
---
I believe there should be a maximum distortion between each faction of only 20% or so - so if the player cap is lets say 3k for ease - 60% one faction when server is capped would be 1.8k and the other faction would be 1.2k
---
What even is the point of this shitpost.
---
There won't be a classic shop.
---
What does it even matter seriously.. 
---
Still this discussion is part of the 1.0-1.12.1, because Blizzard made various macro changes over the timeline of vanilla. For example breaking Decursive, therefore it is at their own discretion if they want to break 40men queueing (ab-)using the queue commands for AV in the LUA. Or the dependancy macros that make stance dancing doubletap braindead for warriors. 
---
Some may greet these changes, some may not, but all discussion are part of the scope of vanilla. 
---
Forcefeeding along the lines of "you dont have to enable it, but you can" is as disingenuous as telling people they can still ride their ground mount even though they fly, or move to the dungeon by foot even though the dungeon finder is in place. 
---
Fact is: if its in the game by default, the demand of other players to use the tools increases tenfold. You can't just say anymore: "Nah, didn't bother installing it", when it's one mouseclick away. I bet people would get hostile when coordinates are in the game by default and somebody asks for landmark directions.
---
Shout out to OSRS as well, can almost guarantee it was used as a positive example that classic will be successful 
---
You guys not nervous about hearing a warrior when 2500 of every 5k pop server will be DPS warriors?
---
Problem with private servers and considering 3k as "dead servers" is they take into account players from all around the world while classic servers should have them all into US East, US West, EU (with appropriate time zones) and OCE servers.
---
I'm sure I missed some, but you get the idea.
---
Do you think it is worth it to spend the time doing the quest if trying to get to 60 ASAP?
---
Hi, /u/Glamo-GM
---
Things are different then they were then. Officers shared accounts with the guild mates. Blizzard didn't care.
---
Blizzard cares now. A guild bank system is a change I'd be okay with unless blizzard doesnt hassle people about account sharing.
---
The worst crowding will be the starter zones, which is why Blizz put sharding into those areas specifically.
---
A lot of the retail crowd won't make it past level 5 once they hit the revelation that for a lot of your leveling journey, pulling more than 1 mob is a death sentence.
---
I dont understand the logic behind this. You dont want sharding in the starting zones because it ruins the experience and you wont be able to "make friends" and interact with the community the same way, but then offer transfers as an alternative, which actually would cause the community to split in half. How do you not see the irony in that?  And if you suggest transfers from overpopulated servers to less populated, what would be wrong in merging those servers in which there is only 700 people. Its literally the same thing.
---
They might not be better DPS, but the ability to heal and have an on demand offensive dispel makes up for it. In premades they are very desired, you drop WF for your warriors, dispel stuff, nuke focus targets, and heal. Its probably one of the hardest jobs in the game for high end pvp, you have about a million hotkeys and a half a million things to pay attention to.
---
What if, Y2K finally happens 20 years later and all our computers die and we can’t play any more?!
---
This hasn’t specifically been mentioned, but I’m confident that we’ll get the updated buff hierarchy system in classic that will work the way it was meant to actually work, I.e you can’t buff yourself with a ‘weaker’ version of it, even if it’s from different sources. 
---
In vanilla, buffs would of course display as active but not actually give you the benefit in many cases, I’m pretty sure they’ll not let you buff/use the scroll/drink the potion if a stronger one is active. 
---
I’m sure someone will find a reason for why this is a bad thing. 
---
You think you do, but you don't.
---
I haven't levelled to max level on a character since cataclysm... Recently tried to play again but I just can't be bothered. Just want to play classic.
---
Yeah I didn't even knew I wanted spell batching and now we got it! 
---
Great shit - the hype is real
---
If I wouldn't have Outward to distract me right now I guess I'd shoot up straight through the roof in my neighbors flat.
---
Was easy enough really, sure it was double the price of Legend of Mir 
---
2 but unfathomably better (and I loved Mir2!) plus the rate of content and patches compared to Mir, easy decision!
---
I can't speak for horde, but sm/ruin as an ally is very far from ideal on a pvp server.  Undead rogues/warriors basically nullify fear
---
Mind control is so strong in vanilla, mind vision is also huge for calling out the enemy FC in wsg. I'm kind of torn between Warlock and spriest. As a priest you always have a group spot, even if it means you have to spec healer. They are both similar but priest can go to low level zones and heal the humans that the orc players fight, so you can give em a hard time.
---
When Nostalrius was around, it felt like the unofficial official Vanilla server, if that makes sense?
---
We do though. They are the main reason. And Blizzard treated them with distain and legal threats. Their work lives on in other p servers, meanwhile.
---
I would have preferred dual-specc, but that's not gonna happen. You could roll class like a Hunter or a Warlock that wouldn't have to respecc. Same could possibly be said about Mages and Ele/Resto-Shamans if you join a more casual guild.
---
Warlock in raids are primarily there to debuff mobs and bosses to everyone else can get their DPS on ..and also for Soulstones and Summoning people.
---
Still, I loved my little demon wrangling, curse flinging, bald and mustachioed gnome.
---
But it's still an issue for healers who can't control what others do. If you make it so healers don't tag for DKs you could have a raid lock down a place with only one or two aggressive players killing civs while the healers keep them permanently alive with no punishment.
---
Making no DKs and unkillable civs is the solution that puts game play and fun first, which is the main reason I hated DKs when they came in, they were anti fun.
---
Up until what point can I successfully tank as an arms warrior while leveling?
---
Well it depends on which night elf you are asking. Night elf demon hunters will start on lvl 18 in Demon Fall Canyon to learn double jumping. They will need a portal to join other players in Westfall later on.
---
Hi, /u/skunkmonk3y
---
It's amazing to think it's been around 3 years since then. 3 years to get Classic.
---
Male troll anything, the people who play them are always special and I’m just not that special
---
Didn't you miss Fairie Fire (Feral)?
---
That is the one thing I'd miss from the whole feral tree for 5mans. The ranged aggro and mana-free instant pull is just soooo gooood. 
---
I can aggro 2 melee and a caster mob by pulling the melees, not move and keep generating enough threat on the ranged just with fairie fire to keep it on me despite the heals. It really helps melee DDs, they hate it when the mobs move/change direction.
---
Not sure about WC2 since i haven’t booted it up yet but 1 has no issues on w10.
---
This guy codes
---
Agree with this but WOD is definitely in the last group, The prune was aggressively pursued in the last 3 expansions
---
Based on what server ? Private server experience is notorious for being incorrect 
---
This is the first one i've seen to be honest, nice try though.
---
I didn’t mind your voice. You just sound like you’re from Philly. 
---
Was one of them Alexsensual?
---
Thank God. I'm really gonna need it auto attacking on my paladin 
---
My first character was an evil looking gnome warlock. I really embraced the "I am evil" theme and went around killing rabbits. 
---
Always been horde, were rolling ally lol
---
I think this kind of posts are written by Activions.
---
When I'm not getting what I want, it's much easier for me to believe that the employees at Blizzard are faceless monsters.
---
Really wanting to play a nelf priest. But feel compelled to pick dwarf, since I wanted to raid. Conflicted
---
And add 5 or 6 minute of useless chat about how thing should be in his mind
---
You can tank as arms all the way up to 60 including 5 mans. Obviously Protection will generally be better but for casual content it's fine.
---
If you want to tackle Classic WoW with a sense of danger and difficulty. I'd honestly suggest tanking as a priest, its heaps of fun and integrates offensive and defensive spells. Contrary to popular belief, you can manage to get quite far in raiding. However, its not for the faint of heart and demands you to put in the effort. I grabbed it up a year ago and its a blast to play.
---
BFA is the son of Creed, Classic is Rocky.
---
Your math is correct...the numbers aren't
---
The initial cap (with sharding) at Classic launch will be 10k + Blizzard's estimation of tourists. That can go up to 20k (which is what I personally expect). A LOT of people don't understand that, because they don't know the Vanilla realm population numbers.
---
The medium TOTAL population of a Vanilla realm was around 10k players. There were 7.4 million players, with China, SK and Japan counting for roughly 2 million of them. I will ignore the numbers of Oceanic realms because it is small enough to be irrelevant in this estimation. The 5-5.4 million players left were playing on US realms (I think there were 236 US realms) and EU realms (I think there were 247 EU realms). In total, there were 483 US and EU realms for 5-5.4 million players.
---
That gives roughly between 10,351 and 11,180 players per a US or EU realm. I rounded up to 10k for ease of understanding.
---
To preserve a TOTAL population of a Classic realm similar to Vanilla (10k players) after the tourists are gone, the Classic realms, during launch, must accommodate 10k player PLUS the Blizzard's estimation (which is better than any of us) of the tourists.
---
While Blizzard's estimation of the number of tourists is better than any of us, it is fairly safe to say that around half of the Classic players, during launch, will be tourists. It could be 40%, it could be 60%, or even more. But 50% is quite a common denominator seen on this sub and Blizzard's official forums.
---
With sharding in place for launch, Blizzard will start Classic realms with (if 50% of the initial players will be tourists) the Vanilla realm total population (10k) plus an additional 10k for tourists.
---
Once the 10k tourists are gone and once the casuals (70-80% of the 10k players left) will enter normal gaming mode, the concurrent player population for Classic realms will settle at 2-3k.
---
Sure, there will be realms that will have a HIGHER tourist population, and realms that will have a LOWER tourist population at launch. But it will still be in the range of what Blizzard is estimating, give it 5-10% more or less, which still is in the 2-3k concurrent player range.
---
It is called SHARDING, and it is already taken.
---
Watch them implement a moon walking option toggle and impress us now
---
You should be finde tanking all 5 mans, including the "endgame" ones like Strath/Scholo/DM etc.. Some stamina plate gear, good 1h+shield and know what you're doing should be good enough. Better tank-gear helps obviously. I'd suggest to tank some instances prior to 50 and get used to tanking, if you're new to the classic warrior.
---
&gt; His point is that this that it being blizzlike should be overruled by its outdated nature for most rational people. 
---
Yeah, 10 years ago people were like living in caves and cellphones with cups and wire
---
Sure, but so what? That was the game. The best gear was earned from killing raid bosses. Arena PvP is and always was a sideshow. By catering to purist PvP players, it changed the game for the worse. WoW tried to be everything to everyone.
---
Yes, please Blizzard! Keep the server pop at 2.5k or what ever it was in vanilla. #NoChanges, for real.
---
As a German... Yeah, the french have shown to be stubborn about their language in several games I've played. Be it League of Legends, warcraft 3, FFXIV, doesn't matter.
---
Lots of French players refuse to speak English, and if they do something wrong/want something will tell you in french. Mate, your language isn't really international, if you desperately wanna speak your native tongue that's cool, that's what french servers/connection settings are for.
---
I got banned from the forums because of a bunch of weenies right-clicking my post as trolling. I submitted a ticket and explained why I thought the post was not trolling.
---
The CM agreed completely, restored the post and removed the ban. The right-clickers' victory a post they didn't like lasted a total of about 9 hours.
---
I'm rolling a hunter and thinking of going skinning/enchanting (mainly for disenchanting), so I can still use track humanoids etc.  
---
True, but I think it’s safe to assume a large percentage of those warriors will be relatively bad. You can take two players with equivalent stats and gear, and one that knows how to play versus one who doesn’t is easily apparent. Pretty high skill cap. 
---
They are both quite challenging, but so damn worth it. The story telling is cool too :)
---
&gt; I know most people here on reddit are young and naive 
---
lol. ok. I have done software development for almost 30 years. You are the young and naive one.
---
Undead.
---
Casting animation is BiS
---
&gt; Griefing is fun.
---
Apparently not, or it wouldn't be called griefing
---
The high pop servers during Vanilla were the best experience, so I imagine they will strive to hit those numbers. The issue is sustain.
---
Enemy teams in wow PvP on later expansions in retail often had mild hacks/bots activated as well. Interrupt bots that kick you on the first frame you begin a cast were the norm, even in casual bgs. Was pretty annoying. I hate generalizing, but I noticed this the most with russian bg teams.
---
I've had issues with 1, but 2 works great. 
---
Wouldn't that be a Christmas miracle?
---
Sure buddy. You've very clearly never worked on a major product. You don't make multiple large sweeping changes like this in a fucking week or two lmao.
---
In BC at least, there were even a few such places that WEREN'T in the fatigue zone, where you could swim directly down for up to 5 minutes before reaching the sea floor. (Along the Northern coast of Kalimdor, near Moonglade.)
---
It could get real buggy down there too, the game didn't seem to know if your were in water or air, so you could breath safely but were still swimming and the underwater filter disappeared. If you got too close to the actual ocean floor you just died instantly with no message.
---
Depends whether you're going for just "super rare item" or something that shows you to be an elite player.
---
Super rare items like Thunderfury, Raggy Hammer, Baron's mount, etc all got you noticed.
---
The real Rolex was your guild name. Every server had those few top tier guilds that people respected.
---
&gt; We were killing guards and some dumbass had to go kill a quest giver or vendor every time
---
ok. You do realize that killing a vendor sets off the alarms too, right?
---
I still don't understand why the raid was "ruined" and everyone left. It seems like that more LocalDefense warnings is a good thing for a world pvp raid.
---
can't say anything about the voiceovers because i haven't heard them, but yeah what they did to a lot of the lore from wc3 is pretty garbage, so i doubt altering wc3 to fit what they did is gonna be good
---
Why would they offer transfers from a dead realm to another dead realm?? I'm saying they offer free transfers from dead realms to healthy realms. 
---
It's optional sure, but if you want to stay on a dead realm I think that should be well within your rights. Those that don't want to can transfer over to a healthy one instead.
---
&gt; Because it punished you heavily
---
How did it punish you? Was it not allowing you to kill players of the opposing faction? 
---
Well look at this badass over here, pumping more hours in a day than possible. You're making Kronus proud, son.
---
I second this. Even without any talent points in Feral you will have to use Bear/Cat frequently. Because you go oom pretty fast if you stay in caster form all the time.
---
Starfire &gt; Moonfire &gt; Insect Swarm &gt; Bear/Cat to finish the mob off.
---
1d difference is fking huge to be honest.
---
There was a private server that put all spells and talents into a pool and let you build your own character. Was really fun but as is tradition, most people went with the same handful of builds and shunned originality, even if it worked.
---
RP-PvP wasn't just about the RP or the PvP. The stricter rules of RP made for a more respectable environment and the PvP gave more of a risk vs reward balance.
---
It was and is the best of both.
---
It's very easy.
---
In vanilla they offered free transfers from full realms to low pop realms. This obviously didn't work because who wants to move to a dead realm.
---
They just have to use the same technique but instead of transfers from high&gt;low they offer free transfers from low&gt;medium which then causes the medium pop server to become a high one.
---
If you want to stay on the dead realm you can choose to do so, it's your loss.
---
Take tbc raiding, add 15 players, reduce the required skill by a bit mechanics wise and you're done.
---
It's really similar, resgear is required for many bosses or atleast makes life easier, and it's as straight forward as it gets. Mc and bwl need fire res, aq40 nature and naxx needs frost res as well.
---
okay comparing something to back at the barnyard is a really devastating insult, so i went to look up the cutscenes thinking ''there is no way that's true'' oh snap, i'm sorry i doubted you??? 
---
also trying to make the human faces hyperrealistic while trying to have the rest stay true to its cartoony roots looks fucking bad and surreal now (just imo) and will look even worse in a few years
---
Or will there?
---
Can someone explain this one? Me no understando.
---
Is there a source for xp values being correct? How do you know?
---
&gt;  and unlike transfers to DEAD REALMS
---
Why would they ever offer transfers to dead realms??? Offer transfers FROM dead realms to medium pop realms.
---
They don’t have 700 extra community managers to argue instead of working. 
---
There still is! Can’t say the name but It’s still alive and well. The meta is cancer as always tho :p
---
&gt;full time gamers weren't a thing
---
Yes they were, they didn't get paid though which is probably what you mean. I get this whole fear about streamers though, this might suck.
---
When I say that the game was meant to be balanced around 5 person groups, I'm talking about 5-player dungeons. Blizzard seemed to think that would carry over to arena (it didn't). The 5v5 bracket was the one that they were pushing during those first few seasons in TBC, not the 3v3 bracket.
---
As for Vanilla's PvP system: the best gear is supposed to be unobtainable. At the end of the day, it doesn't really matter because the better gear isn't *that* much better. The difference between the Rank 10 set (obtainable by anyone over a long enough period of time) and the Rank 13 set (only for the hardcore few) is not large and the sets are only made up of 6 pieces of gear. If you're wearing the Rank 10 set and you outplay someone in Rank 13 gear, then you will beat them.
---
&gt; You don't make multiple large sweeping changes like this in a fucking week or two lmao.
---
ok, "lmao". Dude, I'm 55. I've been a professional software developer since I graduated from college in 1989. 
---
I'm not some coder wannabe who started as a QA and nowsuddenly thinks he's an experienced software developer because he got promoted to script work a few years ago.
---
Because if you were experienced, you would have been around long enough to know that software organizations are culturally driven from the top and they vary everywhere.
---
Have you ever worked for Blizzard? For Activision? Do you personally know anyone who has? Have you ever seen the wow server source code? Have you ever seen the server source code for private servers?
---
Because if you had, you would not be so naive as to think that everything that seems complicated on paper is also complicated in code, and everything that seems easy on paper is easy in code.
---
Ha, you cant have a Shaman and Paladin in the same raid, Jokes on you!
---
The news has got me showing my oh face. https://youtu.be/QzIN3EgBIHg
---
Surprisingly, fury or arms warrior is exceptionally good, as the rage generation from being hit multiple times means you can spam cleave, hitting and killing multiple mobs at once. I made a fortune farming low level instances as a warrior in classic.
---
Ecks deh.
---
I played both mage and SPriest on vanilla retail, and honestly, the only thing that is slicker than mage, is SPriest. SPriest is basically a non boring to play mage, with great ability to farm, and who is  beast in wpvp.
---
You need 4% to reach the cap, even then there will always be a 1% base chance to resist. Not counting different buffs and talents other classes might have.
---
TLDR; spell hit cap is 4% at equal level for both pvp and pve. 
---
Man / Woman believes no one likes BFA, but are all reallllly interested in Classic.
---
I don't, but I used to grind rather than quest in the past so it's not a massive issue - i would like to have the reputation you get from questing this time around though :p
---
The weapon is key part of warrior speed, Id say yes
---
No classic lvling guide gives you unique tips. You do the best quests with the most optimal pathing to limit waste of time + mob grind. That's mostly basic stuff for someone who searched for speed leveling routes. Optimal pathing is usually the only thing that differs.
---
Current wow and classic are two completely different games. Wow classic is everquest lite, current wow is basically a mobile game on PC.
---
Playing on a PVE server, flying was actually good. I loved flying around in the scenery, Nagrand and Blade's Edge had some very nice areas. 
---
Can we please reduce the hate on flying? :3
---
The guy is a tool, I made a post on the forums and he responded as a blue CM that spell batching was never an issue and was nonexistent. Perhaps there was a bigger reason he was laid off.
---
private servers don't count for shit in speed runs.
---
20% faster? Yeah, that's pretty hard to believe
---
NO WAI!
---
In PvE?... Every (dps) spec in classic has a lower skillcap than BM hunters on live.
---
I always thought $15 was a bargain. But then again, I had a job
---
&gt; You still need to explain how the rest of the post (that you clipped away) isn't calamity by definition.
---
What exactly do I need to explain? His first point was completely wrong and needed to be corrected.
---
noob, I would play 48/7
---
People are making death threats over specific implementations of Warcraft systems? 
---
Lovely.
---
That's not how Blizzard will frame it.
---
Better to not have sharding at all, and no precedent, than risk them doing Blizzard things and fucking it up
---
Biggest one.
---
for the emprahhhhh
---
*dies instantly after leaving land raider*
---
https://youtu.be/4zwHCx54mIM
---
Take it all the way back to the original MaNGOS team. Nostalrius would not have existed without them
---
100% wait for Classic (since you're on the classic board, I imagine most people here will say the same). Current WoW is so bloated, confusing and boring for new players. It's ridiculously easy, dungeons groups as you level will probably not speak to you and just charge ahead destroying everything, less emphasis on being social etc. etc. etc.
---
Just explain that it's your first time when in groups in case you make some mistakes and listen to people's advice. Man, I wish I was in your shoes.
---
/tinfoil hat
---
They have only implemented spell batching because modern servers cant deal with large scale battles without sharding and 40 man raiding.
---
In BfA the game lags out with more than 20 people on the screen.
---
Im pretty sure it was 30% chance for Glancing blow not 20% ??!?
---
Notorious? Sure, 2 years ago. Doing research on a topic you wanna discuss is going to get you a long way.
---
&gt;I've been a professional software developer since I graduated from college in 1989. I'm not some coder wannabe who started as a QA and now suddenly thinks he's an experienced software developer because he got promoted to python scripting a few years ago.
---
Hahaha, well that would explain a lot actually if you think we do things the old way in fucking Kobol without a second thought about the future or probably even a versioning system. Python? Really? Is that what you think people use in large software projects these days?
---
&gt;Have you ever worked for Blizzard? For Activision? 
---
No. I have worked for companies that release AAA online games.
---
&gt;Do you personally know anyone who has? 
---
Of course. Anyone in the industry working for large companies will get contacts all over the place after a few years, which you'd know if you weren't so full of shit. Why is this relevant? Does your delusional self think that us software devs exchange source codes with each other? Ever even heard of a NDA?
---
&gt;Have you ever seen the wow server source code? 
---
No, and neither have you. What I have seen and worked on is the source code for similarly massive projects.
---
&gt;Have you ever seen the server source code for private servers?
---
Yes, of course, I've been in the private server scene since literally vanilla, it's what got me into programming in the first place.
---
You can trust them to release Classic, no worries on it being a hoax. They've put too much into it to not release it.
---
And you're looking at it the wrong way. It's not that Blizzard would implement sharding in order to save money. It's that they would implement sharding in order to broaden their target market for Classic. It's been over a decade that they've been targeting casual players specifically, and BFA is currently a clusterfuck even casuals don't want to touch. I can easily see some higher ups ordering the Classic team to implement sharding as a way to make a QoL change to Classic, making it easier for the casual player. Less ganking and less fighting for resources and mobs.
---
As I recall, what he said was that it was already being looked at in some capacity at the time the Nostalrius team met with Blizzard at their offices. There's little doubt that Nostalrius's success (combined with the community's petition) is what spurred Blizzard to take notice of the interest in vanilla servers.
---
It's a gamble.
---
* Let's assume that the original cap was 2500 concurrent players.
---
* They create 4 shards per server based on some estimated drop-off which makes it so that the server can handle 10k concurrent players.
---
* There is no guarantee that every server across the board will lose 75% of its population after any given time and land on a 2.5k after they turn off sharding.
---
Yeah me and my friends got stuck in this circlejerk "people pay the same price for a beer at pub, this actually cheaper!" 
---
Not that 15 would be a problem now but it's honestly a bad way to rationalize,  it's like those quit smoking apps that showed you how much you could've saved if you quit, when the truth is you'd most likely just spend the money somewhere else. Wow was and is and extra expense,  not something you 'save money on. 
---
Not that it's any different from Netflix and all that stuff we got these days, but back in the days I really had to pull out the arguments for my mom's credit card. 
---
&gt; While Blizzard's estimation of the number of tourists is better than any of us, i
---
I suspect this is going to be dynamically calculated along the lines of "if this account was active during Legion or WoD, count it as a tourist"
---
He does use rested.  
---
He plays on a local server and the run you're referencing was started before it was figured out how to disable rested exp on a server level.  
---
All he does is not to log out in an inn, which still generates rested exp. Further more he said he had some "irl stuff" to take care of after he hit 50 so his char just sat there getting extra rested exp.  
---
I do agree however, it can be done faster, considering how inefficient his "updated" guide is.
---
No problem! Healing is a lot of fun and I always enjoyed the priest. The only mistake I think you can make is rolling Paladin. Alliance scum.
---
There are 2 limits:
---
- You need to get exalted to the city you want the mount from, except for your own city (so a troll doesnt need rep for a raptor but an UD does)
---
- There are some other limitations as well, like taurens can't ride raptors due to their size. I think UD horse is also out of the question for them, only kodo and wolf are available.
---
You're telling Wow Classic fans to avoid a game because it's difficult?  Know your audience, man.. we like the challenge :D  
---
I grew up on WC 1 &amp; 2.. Honestly I hated 3, because it didn't feel like a Warcraft game at all.  To each their own! 
---
Ultima: "So is it true that the old server cap for retail vanilla was ~3k"
---
Grummz: "More or less. Cap was dynamic. We could raise and lower it."
---
He then goes on to say "Hardware could only handle 3500-4000 max". So the hardware could handle more than what the cap was. 4k was the most the servers could handle, ~3k was the actual cap for the most part.
---
I got to 60 in 2 days 23 hours with no rested, but I multibox boosted... Horde side is so ridiculous for the aoe boosting, I made it to level 33 in under 24 hours as a druid and wrote a personal guide for the best boost spots. Any questions about spots lmk 😋
---
Lol that definitely does happen, but given good comments and time to study it should be possible to understand pretty much anything. I have no doubt the classic team has a very good technical understanding of spell batching in classic.
---
So you're saying that they increase the cap for concurrent players for a few weeks and then lower it down to its authentic size? That's an okay solution, especially since sharding will be enabled during that period.
---
I stand corrected.
---
&gt;Which does not affect Joana's speedrun since he doesn't get rested.
---
That's not true. He only played for an average of 4 hours per day. He did state that he logged outside of inns  for most of the time, but there was a period where he wrote a Warlock summoning guide over 3 days where he was inside an inn.
---
It came back for a few months as Felmyst.  And he intentionally changed stuff to not be blizzlike.  Made encounters harder, etc.
---
Thanks for the info I had no idea. I thought that current WOW was just a collection of a bunch of expansion packs that progressively built off of classic wow. And that the new release was going to be WOW without all of the expansion packs. Can you elaborate a bit more on what classic wow will be to clarify anything else I misunderstand please. Thank you! 
---
They look awesome in raid gear though!
---
Nemesis shoulders looking like car bumpers from madmax!
---
I wouldn’t say it was a scenario where minds were changed, more like reminded that spell batching was a thing. Remember back when it was said that we needed the communities help. This was an example of the community helping make Classic. 
---
Before that there was no conversation to my knowledge at that point. They likely would’ve noticed it and replicated it on their own, but the post and conversation led to a discussion point to highlight that they’re being as authentic to Vanilla as they can be.
---
Solid clickbait 👌🏻
---
People make death threats over everything. I remember back in 2015 I saw two separate people threatening death on Wow devs for not letting them fly in Draenor. For some people this is all they have, and it shows.
---
He said that 3.5-4K was a *hardware limit*. Given that, there's exactly 0% chance that the server cap was set at 4K. 
---
WF procs from mortal strike and stormstrike aswell. So the weapon speed doesnt affect your dps even with WF unless you have a auto attack reset like MS and SS.
---
I was just thinking, what a lucky guy to be able to experience vanilla wow for the first time in 2019. 
---
Count every BFA account that's playing as a tourist?
---
Thanks for the input. I tried current WOW and felt the same. I felt as if it was all just a bunch of fetch quest. I was very disappointed , but now feel a bit better knowing that classic wow might be different. Do you think so? I am super excited for this. If you are an OG WOW player I can imagine that you would love to be in my shoes right about the time of classic WOW release lol. 
---
He created the best scripted TBC private server to date that was incredibly hyped, only to have it shut down by blizzard in less than an hour of being online because he hosted it in the US.
---
Can you just do other green quests or dungeons rather than orange quests? I get why you wouldn't do it, I'm asking if it's possible in general. In my current pserver I've never done any red or orange quests, apart from bosskills in dungeons.
---
Vanilla/TBC servers raided for years with 3K caps
---
Undead warrior.
---
I think they look awful. Tiny shoulder and half the armour missing so bones can stick out.
---
Nice. Buying when I get home. Have been waiting to replay wc2 for a while.
---
Declining server populations are a given, I don't think anyone will argue with that. The discussion is, what do you do when a server becomes "dead".
---
Assume you have three categories population-wise. Low, medium and high. Low in this case would be dead or dying. 
---
The best solution in my mind is to offer free transfers from low to medium.
---
3/10 for trolling. The last sentence was to forced.
---
This seems like the simplest approach. People who want higher numbers can play with people who like that environment. There's no changes to how the game works on a fundamental level, just more people playing together. A couple clearly marked high cap servers can keep those people happy without impacting anyone else.
---
Those wanting original vanilla caps can play on servers with those caps and get the experience they wanted with others wanting the same thing.
---
Haha this is hilarious, imagine  a bunch of devs sitting in  a room just yelling them out : aperape,bigfatasscow, cumbucket!
---
I remember my first run in with the profanity filter I think somewhere in STV when I was replaying my friend "kk" and accidentally added an extra "k". We could not for the life of us figure out why it was censored lol (we were like 11). 
---
Free transfers are the best way to handle that in my opinion. Open up free transfers from low pop servers to medium pop servers so that they become high pop servers.
---
Fixed it
---
[No, I don't think they should.](https://i.imgur.com/Dywhwc7.jpg)
---
They have never done that before (low to high), presumably because they don’t want to create dead servers for those that miss the boat.
---
I think they can add them till the 3rd Phase so Not all can get them and its a early gold burner to reduce the Inflation.
---
WoW 2 - Timeline taking place in the beginning of second war, modern wow graphics, class design somewhere in the between of wotlk/cata/mop with old school talent trees. Yes please
---
Man / Woman preaching to the choir, and I love it so I upvote
---
I think times have changed. I feel like I do this myself a lot on every aspect of life. When buying new products, building something, playing something, I constantly find myself Googleing for the ultimate best solution. I guess the overflowing information available has changed that. But I feel it really has a negative impact on the gaming experience on a personal level. As if one couldnt enjoy if there was a possibility that someone else had a teeny tiny edge on you. I will deff try to play from a more roleplaying perspective rather than focusing on micro min-maxing. Just my two cents.
---
So a few months pass and suddenly its "Gummy did nothing wrong" spamfest again? Are those guys serious in thinking that?
---
And yes, blizz did take a ton of notes from private servers when making decisions for classic, its obvious they did and smart (because atm some private servers have had classic up longer than blizz did themselves)
---
don't misunderstand:  there are still tons of fetch quests.  leveling can be a slog.  but if you can stick with it, the community is what makes it worthwhile for most people.  it's not for everyone, but if it's for you,  you win!
---
There's obviously a middle ground between lagfest and batching to the point that spell interactions become possible and I'm sure they will fine tune it until they find the sweet spot
---
I don’t think it’s disingenuous.  All the important addons will still be dictated by your raid/guild.  The idea is that I wouldn’t have to go to a 3rd party website to download a 3rd party addon to access functionality that already existed in the base UI they’re developing classic from.  
---
Why is releasing an older version of av different from the staggered pve releasing were getting, or staggered release of tier 0.5.
---
No one thinks of 1.12 AV when they think of Classic AV, if theyre going for an authentic classic experience (and it really seems like they are) literally any av patch before 1.12 would be better.
---
Thanks for the reply! Funny thing is, I actually knew the 27-28% for warriors, recorded the sound bit saying 27%, and then tried to look it up just to be sure and found multiple people saying it was 17%, which made me change it. The glancing blow bit was definitely off, but that's something I can change. I plan to edit this up a bit more, fix the issues and reupload so it's as accurate as possible. 
---
Thanks for the feedback!
---
Interestingly it's now on the list but Lucifer is also a prohibited name. I know first hand...... Don't ask 
---
Pretty close! I'm only an hour and change away from Philly. Bit of a coal miner accent.
---
holy shit these are funny
---
Dumb question: how do I hamstring kite?
---
For me Its because it means more counter-ability which means deeper gameplay, especially for instant casts.  Vanishing stuns, gouging blinks etc.
---
Also I wouldnt call it lag exactly. It means spells are delayed until the next batch yes but after a while you get a feel for the batch rhythm and can learn to utilize it.
---
They should bring back dwarf mages while they're at it!
---
Noted! I'll take that into consideration for the edits I'll be making. Thank you!
---
I’m not sure what you mean. Warlocks are the fourth best DPS class for PvE, behind Warrs, Rogues and Mages. And for a chunk of the content, they’re a distant fourth.
---
Thank you for gracing me with this.
---
Get your facts straight boy!
---
Shoutout to Silicone and Synapse for being a terrible name. 
---
I think it could be compressed as well, sometimes I tend to rant for a bit when talking about certain items. Thanks!
---
Cool?
---
No I'm saying they do it now. In vanilla they offered free transfers from **high to low** which obviously is a terrible idea. They just have to do the same thing but instead offer transfers from **low to medium**.
---
They can even leave the transfer open indefinitely, a dead server isn't really an issue if there's a way off it any time you wish. 
---
Server upkeep is irrelevant these days since all the servers are virtual, they could have thousands of dead servers and it wouldn't make a difference, just make sure to flag them as dead so that new players don't roll on them.
---
Sword spec &gt; mace spec for warriors. Ashkandi is much easier to get and a lot better.
---
Things like maps, textures, 3D objects, spell database, item database, mob locations and scripts, etc.
---
A shout-out to everyone who was involved in Classic Wow and it's continued life.
---
On Nost, we got to see what world PVP should be -- hundreds of Alliance trying to kill  Horde in battles over world bosses -- not because of the loot -- but because it was fuckin' FUN.
---
Being able to PVP without feeling like someone put weights on my ankles was a wonderful, wonderful experience -- and for ONCE, World of Warcraft felt like the damn commercials / movies / promotions that were done for the game.
---
To everyone who donated their time, talent and/or monies to keep the project alive -- you da real MVP.
---
And I can't WAIT to battle in SS / TM with hundreds and hundreds of players, and instead of being disconnected, slowed to one frame per minute -- actually battling.
---
World of Warcraft -- world PVP versus BG's -- world PVP is gonna be so much sweeter.
---
Thanks! I was planning on adding some timestamps but this week has been pretty busy as I'm at University right now with a load of papers on my back. I'll definitely make a list of the timestamps the next time around.
---
I'd probably respec once you're at Blackwing Lair
---
Tell your friends :P
---
Lol they can always close the empty servers and give a free transfer off them to the people who play on them. Personally, I’d rather them have too many and not need them than have not enough and need more.
---
i'm curious whether the nost guys that went to speak with blizz actually knew that classic WAS going to happen, but signed an NDA to keep it quiet until it was officially announced.  They were very excited about things immediately after the meeting, then obviously blizz said classic wasn't coming  
---
cut to now, they announced it and release date isn't that long after the announcement - its just better that way cos there's less waiting time
---
I mean, even if this is truly the reason, it still makes it more like Vanilla so I'm not sure what the problem is.
---
Though only time will tell how well Classic servers handle large scale world events. 
---
i love how even here in the small classic wow sub you get comments like this haha
---
So if I have 4% spell hit, do I need to put any points into Shadow Focus to reduce the chance that the target resits?
---
My husband and I met in WoW so I’m really looking forward to playing classic when it’s out. We did a BC server a couple years ago and had a blast. We don’t have time to play and raid like we used to, but I’ll be happy to log on and play for a couple hours here and there. 
---
there was a dwarf priest on every pserver i played on named proctologist
---
Hell yeah. By late TBC I basically counter-charged 80% of intercepts. It was pretty much required t8 beat the best warriors.  This is huge for PvP skillcap. Also jumping stuns!
---
&gt; Python? Really? Is that what you think people use in large software projects these days? 
---
Dude, it was an obvious dig at a QA who got promoted to do software work and now thinks he's an "experienced software developer"
---
You keep sitting on that 8 years, man. You still haven't addressed the idea that you honestly think that a spell batching fix is too complicated to do in a short period of time. I mean, that's the whole point of this discussion. 
---
&gt;Yes, of course, I've been in the private server scene since literally vanilla, it's what got me into programming in the first place.
---
wow, you really are young and inexperienced.
---
resilience was an awful decision, i hated it and i cant see why other people didn't.  they literally introduced a new stat as a lazy way of balancing the game and it was the beginning of the process that led to classes being homogenised
---
"damn... we can't seem to reconcile the damage people can do with the stunlocks and with the amount of cc-breakers and healing... how can we tweak this to make it work?  i know, we'll give everyone the same amount of the same stat which mitigates damage and cc so that fights last longer"
---
awful game design imo, it would be like taking CS and giving all the guns the same rate of fire, recoil and damage
---
They could do that yes, but should they? Should they offer different server types for different tastes when it comes to other aspects of the game too or should the goal be to recreate the classic experience as closely as possible?
---
You will always be CM in our hearts bb
---
that would be possible anyway. thing they made to sto9 that was making stunned targets in the air drop straight down.
---
&gt;You're still gonna be doing fetch quests, collection quests, and grinding. That's just the nature of the game. The difference is you will actually be likely to die in classic; 1 enemy at a time is ok, 2 is dangerous, 3 means death for some classes. In retail you can nuke 5 down at a time without breaking a sweat and it's *so boring*. 
---
Also competitor's tabard is a TBC thing (from 2008 olympic games promotion)
---
&gt;There are tons of threads in here claiming you need every buff under the sun to clear naxx and AQ which simply isn't true
---
I have never seen anyone that claimed you needed these to beat the raids. Got a link? It's just a lot more convenient using them so you can bypass some of the fight mechanics and generally make it much less risky.
---
For all MoPs faults, that was a really bad time to quit as a warlock. I mained it throughout the whole expansion and it was some of the best class design I’ve ever seen in WoW.
---
Was leaning Priest healer, but concerned with sustaining gold at end game. I’ve seen they can farm lashers in DM, but perhaps I’d be better off as a Pally healer?
---
Let's just see what happens at PAX. Good chance we'll get something this weekend.
---
Pretty simple, you hamstring the mob and strafe away from it until your swing timer is up again. It operates on the basic idea that most mobs attack at a higher frequency than you, since you're using a 2h weapon which often times can have over 3.0 sec swing timers. You don't want to let the mob hit you twice or even thrice before you can attack it again.   
---
If you want to be 100% accurate and consistent you will need an swing timer addon (there will definitely be some in the works when classic releases), you can also do it by heart once you get a good feel for your current weapon speed.
---
This is an interesting discussion for sure. Faction imbalance can snowball out of control really fast.
---
In an ideal scenario I'd want them to allocate 50% of the concurrency cap to each of the factions but that's a change to the game and I don't think we're ready for that discussion just yet. 
---
My mate was literally going to come back for specifically old AV and isnt gonna now.
---
It might he a niche thing for a lot of people, but if you want people to come "home", that's a big part of the feel for a lot of people.
---
I’m telling you all it’s going to happen on April Fools day. 
---
&gt;I think Rag, Vael, Huhu, Patch were the only fights where increasing your DPS by an extra 2% might make the difference for vanilla raids that I did
---
If you believe consumables only increase your DPS by 2% then I dont know what to say. For casters alone, consumables mean an increase in spellpower of about 30-40% in BWL/AQ gear.
---
Yeah it is, but it's not twice the speed as I sad in my post.
---
I'm just imagining some neo-Nazi rolling a gnome and losing his mind that he cannot name it lilhitler. 
---
&gt;current wow is basically a mobile game on PC.
---
Could you possibly be more disingenuous? I know this sub is a massive vanilla jerk but grow up.
---
I died the most while levelling. That counts, right?
---
SPriest or holy? What didn’t you like about priest? Am leaning a priest, but torn a bit with Warlock.
---
GOG specifically goes back to old games and gets them to work on newer systems.  It’s working well on w10 for me.
---
If no actual date yet, then maybe a time frame? Beginning summer/midsummer/latesummer That would already help people a lot.
---
Yeah that stuff just becomes natural for you once you play for a long time. My personal favorite is using skull of impending doom when I see the goblin rocket helm charge. Makes noobs confused on why the helm instantly broke :D
---
Ofcourse they do. Why wouldnt they? ND adjusted for blizzlike XP about a year ago, and it's not like the quests, number of mobs and locations of those is some big mystery.
---
So you used a high level char to assist. This is about not having another char to help you kill mobs faster.
---
It wont buy mount but its extra money that should add up
---
Ehh... Is there a video off anyone soloing that elite at 36? My memory is bad, but I vaguely remember not being able to do it back in classic even as 45+
---
Fresh meat
---
Man, can you imagine how much this'd annoy everyone waiting for a date? We're happy to announce classic is coming... sometime in the middle of summer! 
---
Kein Wunder das du die Wörter nicht kennst, du Achselhaarratte
---
Don't listen to most people here. There is a reason games like vanilla wow are extinct. 
---
If you want better gameplay, better end game content, more interesting zones, better balance, play BfA. Its more accessible and definitely worth seeing. Most people aren't that social so I would suggest finding a guild or some buddies to play with you.
---
If you want an old-school grind, a more immersive world, more of a social aspect, wait till Classic. The game will be massively unpolished but that's part of its charm.
---
No I'm pretty sure in classic you started on GM island 
---
I got it on abandonware in the battle chest 2 years ago, works great with windows 10
---
there was one patch for win 10 that made the quest text scroll super fast, but as I have been playing it this past week, it is going perfectly
---
I hadn't play wow for 10 years and dicided to try the return campaign last weekend, i decided since i didnt play for so long to start a new chatacter instead of my old ones.
---
I got to level 50 in 2 days and I didn't die once. Tell me how is not a mobile game feel?
---
We are almost at 400 signatures. Looking good people!
---
Going to do an orc ele sham, going to gurubashi arena at lvl 1 to grab the trinket then trying to befriend the speedrunner enchanter that will farm the timbermaw rep so I can accompany him and get the off-hand, next step is a sweet leveling run

And you? Where will you end up suspicious telephone?
---
Anything but a rogue. Rogues have like no AoE spells so it makes clearing instances very slow. 
---
You do realize Joana's original speedrun was recorded and we have 1-60 footage on youtube right? You can log on a private server, kill the same mobs at the same level and compare the XP. They should very closely match up.
---
Nothing honestly annoy me more than people who parrot what they read on some website without doing research to confirm if its actually true.
---
rofl as someone who loves vanilla and who loves owls (i even have a tattoo of one) this meme is very relevant to my interests
---
vintage memes!
---
Nice attempt at arguments, friend. Guess I hit a weak spot, what school do you work for? Maybe we met! Old timers like you with no concept for actual good code is why old projects have to spend more time cleaning up your spaghetti code than add new features.
---
Yeah sure you can flip a switch, change some numbers, say "yolo" (as us "kids" do these days), and hope it works. But that's not how it works, and hasn't for the past 20 years. There'd be a lot of design talks about it, then the actual implementation, and then these days we have this thing called testing during which we make sure our "simple change" didn't break a thousand other systems. There's significant manual work there when finding out how it worked originally and making sure the new implementation matches that. Loot tables for the loot change would also need a lot of manual work since as they themselves said, due to old fucks like yourself, they don't have the game database from earlier patches.
---
&gt;wow, you really are young and inexperienced.
---
That's actually the best you got after finding out you were and are completely out of your water? 
---
It's a new world, gramps. Maybe you need to look at your own knowledge gaps, or the world will just leave you behind.
---
First we Need to understand, that every weap has a swingtimer. Lets say you got a weapon with 4s Speed. This Translates into you attaking every 4 sec and recharging in between. 
---
Hamstring kiting describes the action of only attacking your opponent when your Swingtimer „recharged“.
---
To do so you hamstring and then get distance. After 4s (swingtime) reangage and Auto and so on. 
---
Power of hamstring kiting comes from the difference between your swingtimer and the one from your Opponent. Lets continue our Example with broken Tooth - a cat with a 1.0 swingtimer.
---
 Performing hamstring kiting will Delay the attacks to every 4.0 (your swingtimer) seconds -&gt;  in this case the real attack Speed from your Opponent is increased by 400% -&gt; you take 75% less dmg.
---
Conclusion 
---
Hamstring kiting is Most effektiv if you have a very Slow weapon and your Opponent attaks really fast. 
---
So if you had that experience surely this must be presented as fact to other people?
---
You used to be able to steal game time cards. They were activated just sitting on the shelf. Three of my friends proceeded to visit every Walmart within an hour every single week to clean out every game card, then sold them for $5 a piece at school.
---
Literally at least 30 kids were playing on stolen time from my school!! Our local Walmart’s stopped carrying them at all for months after that, then kept them behind the counter, before the modern tech came out that allows the card to be inactive until checkout
---
😚
---
Im taking bets on late June, or maybe mid July. They need that summer free time of all the kids to make this happen lol
---
This isn't vanilla. Tourists will kill those servers.
---
No, for pvp it won’t make a difference. The 1% chance to resist is base for all players and cannot be removed. 
---
Yeah, if I'm being honest the picture was just quickly thrown together, just wanted a "cool looking warrior" in the thumbnail so people would maybe be drawn to it more in the related video. Thanks for the reply!
---
Send your followers out on missions through a mission board, click the icon on the world map and see what world quest you can go to to get gear, press the queue dungeon button and get tp'd into an instance where you press the glowing buttons, click a button to get tp'd into an island expedition and press your glowing buttons as you follow a person who might aswell just be an NPC,  and the entire time no one will say a word! Sounds like any mobile game I've ever played. You dont even need to do well as a casual player as most likely one guy can solo carry. 
---
You can argue that M+ and guild raiding breaks this pattern of solo play but let's be honest a completely new guy isnt going to jump right into M+ or get an active guild. Let's face it, the core gameplay he will do IS basically a mobile game.
---
Spell batching remained the same throughout vanilla. 
---
It's not about having the biggest dick compared to the other players, it's about enjoying the game the most.
---
It sucks to see that your party is constantly wiping or takes 4h to clear a dungeon because the tank is full prot with not enough threat, the healer is  spamming regrowth constantly and has to drink after every pull, the dps doing half as much dps as they could, so on and so forth.
---
And in PvP every bit of bonus helps.
---
There is plenty of min/maxing hate on this sub, don't kid yourself.
---
No, shadow priests are not classic pvp servers
---
Thank you! seems a little complex and up to the guild.
---
Have your upvote, dammit
---
Telling people here to not dislike and express their discontent for retail WoW on r/classicwow is like asking a colorblind guy to solve a Rubik's Cube. The reason why we've been advocating for a game's older version that doesn't exist is because of the current game in the first place.
---
Thank you. It seems like Shaman 2.5 is actually good for healing which is awesome. It means they can use it in raids and PvP.
---
The answer is clearly an Undead Rogue with heavy metal playing in the background attacking groups of people already distracted by mobs and substantially undergeared compared to the Rogue.
---
Shoutout to matter which is a fundamental part of everything one can evne think off
---
Agreed, server caps change EVERYTHING about the game. Many people don't realise how much it can do, and advocate for as big of a server as possible.
---
There are so many issues that show up if they increase server caps. You don't need sharding and that kind of stuff on a 3k capped server.
---
I will go out of my way to find a reasonable server, I don't want to have hundreds of people to share quests with. If there's a few people to share quests with, you will be more ready to co operate with them and make friends.
---
I mean vanilla was the glory days of warriors for sure but I think around half of the people who roll warriors will give up on leveling. Especially early when there's good to be so much competition.
---
They are separate afaik, so you gain no benefit past the hit cap (4% in pvp). The only way to get through resistance is by increasing your resistance penetration. Resistance penetration is very rare,  though warlock curses are great for this
---
Yeah, I aoe grinded a mage to 60 on a separate account with the sole intention  of using that mage to boost the rest of my toons to 60. It worked out really well. 
---
Ohh yeah completely forgot cyclonean. Definetely not doable without a healer and a shield
---
If they went through to re-add spell batching, there is always a chance they add that back in too.
---
So you don't think family, children and work can be described as "obligations"?
---
Both paladin and warlock epic mount quests require DM to be released for them to be completed, so it's safe to assume that neither chain will be in-game until phase 2.  
---
As for the unarmored mounts, I think this is a nobrainer since they existed in 1.12 db therefore it should be a formality for blizzard to add them. I personally think ivory/mottled raptors and the unarmored frostsaber/nightsaber look way better than the armored versions. The last couple of the big private servers since "N-server" have implemented them in one way or another, basically having them available until the 1.4 patch rolled out and then if people want to trade in their old mounts for the new ones they would be able to.  
---
The only argument I've seen against this is from people who think that these mounts were only desirable due to the scarcity and that they are objectively worse looking than the new mounts, which I think is silly. Having the unarmored mounts available at the first phases gives a cool "reward" for people who will be tryharding during the early phases, and if people don't like the look they will still be able to trade them in for the newer versions once the appropriate content patch releases.
---
As mentioned in some of the other comments, glancing blow chance increases from equal level and above, so at level 60 fighting 60, I believe the chance I listed in the video, 20%, is correct. However, it increases up to 63, which is the standard for raid bosses in classic, which is 40% chance to give a glancing blow. 
---
The weapon skill bit was a learning process for me -- I tried to reference as many sources as I could, however with most of the information being private server based, I added in a disclaimer for that portion of the video. I wasn't sure if it was absolutely correct because it didn't seem right according to my memory. So you're probably right, I just couldn't find any sources to back me up on that one. Thanks for the reply!
---
35 is realistic as long as you have a group or atleast a healer helping you. I did it @ 35 with a shaman helping
---
I certainly hope so.
---
I agree with you that the pre-bis does look terrible -- I chose the picture because he's wearing flashier armor that would grab the attention of people who scroll through the recommended videos section, to be completely honest. 
---
Ye um , not sure about your reply. The dude I replied to was not talking about min maxing posts, but nice try though!
---
After 10 years of catering to people with jobs, Blizzard is finally catering to unemployed people. Rip planned vacation @ work.
---
&gt; he hosted it in the US.
---
Oof.
---
That's not a very sensible move. Trademark owners are *required by law* to defend their trademark. Even if Blizzard had wanted him to succeed they could not have let him.
---
If it was at least hosted abroad and kept a lower profile, Blizzard could have argued that they were unaware or that enforcement wasn't feasible.
---
Oh definately. This means no obligation towards the guild, like farming consumes, 100% bis gear required, 100% attendance required, stuff like all the harsh requirements most hardcore guilds will come up with.
---
Thanks for all the feedback everyone! I'll be making some edits to this video to up the quality and the accuracy of the information later this afternoon, and pinning a comment below the video to the newer updated version, as well as timestamps. Your feedback is much appreciated!
---
Modern WoW is a game
---
Classic WoW is a world
---
 "it's about enjoying the game the most." Exactly! Whats fun for you as a min maxer wont be fun for me as a casual :) If you dont want to play with non min/maxers then dont, ezpz! Perhaps play retail where there is [raider.io](https://raider.io), that might suit you better?
---
Thank you
---
&gt; If you think a private server speedrun dont give a close indication of how fast you will be leveling in Classic you are an idiot.
---
They never have in the past, but suddenly they do now and Joana knocks a full 20% of his speed run?
---
And you call me an "idiot" for saying private servers don't count. 
---
Why don't we just wait until Classic comes out and see if the record drops 20% before being so self-assured that private servers are suddenly accurate barometers of leveling.
---
Play on a private server, join a guild and get comfy with socialising with them, ask them questions, this is what I've done.
---
Our guild has a private server that we do instances and hopefully raids in the future, I'm learning a lot, I never played wow before it.
---
They probably don't have a set date yet. They'll probably want to beta test.
---
Me and three wife are about to renovate our basement and create a nice room to put two computers in just for Classic.
---
At the moment it looks like we are going for two druids. 😊
---
I expect that we'll get a release date 40-80 days prior to release. They're not going to spring it on ya but they don't want to drum up the hype machine too far before release. 
---
I named my Tauren Shaman 'Nightflame', and 35 levels in decided I hated the name. I reported my own name to a GM claiming it was offensive because it was the name of my Native American tribe. 
---
To be fifteen again!
---
Not to mention the swing animation with 2h, looks like they can barely lift it
---
&gt; nd yes, blizz did take a ton of notes from private servers when making decisions for classic
---
You do know that they have the actual 1.12 server and client up and running in their basement?
---
What would they learn from the Franken-Servers? How not to do it?
---
&gt; It's a new world, gramps. Maybe you need to look at your own knowledge gaps, or the world will just leave you behind.
---
Thanks, kid. I'll take that into account on the video game development work I'm currently involved in.
---
Versus a laughing horde player 30 levels above you jumping around and laughing at you before waiting for you to engage a mob to go poke you down to 10% health so the mob can finish you off and give you a repair bill?  Versus 5 laughing horde rolling around in a gank squad? 
---
Does batching apply to movement as well? 
---
If you want to play a warrior but choose not to because other people will be, you will be more sad than if you chose something else.
---
Play the class you want, and the race you want. The rest will work itself out. 
---
Especially when it also has that pink hair
---
Why don't you wait until classic comes out before being so self-assured that private servers are suddenly completely off.
---
Yes! Me and my boyfriend, i played TBC-MoP and he only played a bit in MoP, but we were only friends back then. Now we are going to play together: i'll be a Druid and he'll be a Shaman. We have more friends coming back to the game and we are very excited!
---
I disagree. Being a good enougth DPS to clean MC and BWL is easy, specially with caster, but being a melee top DPS in AQ40 and beyond really require to perfectly know the fight AND being able to milk every single bit of power from your char, which can be really hard.  
---
With any luck there will be something like tmorph for classic which will allow you to do all of that through the client. Old style model editing was a more of a hassle and you were able to do a lot of game breaking exploits with it. One such example was editing the ZA door so that it was passable, thereby eliminating the timer and allowing you to easily acquire the bear mount. People rightfully got banned for this. 
---
I doubt they will announce it before they're 100% sure they have everything in and steady. I'd personally like to see stress test how well the servers perform without sharding and realms being capped.
---
The current game just feels BAD to play when you see more than 20 players in same area, instantly gets laggy. Not sure when this started to happen, but this shit didnt happen on the earliest expansions, atleast to this extend.
---
Gates of AQ to be opened by highest pop server first.
---
Missed ALOT the first time. I went

Barrens

Stonetalon mountains
---
Thousand Needles
---
Arathi Highlands
---
Desolace 
---
Tanaris

Searing Gorge

That's it.  So I didn't see too much and it was mostly desert. This time I'm looking forward to ashenvale, STV, feralas &amp; ashara.
---
Soon
---
I believe it was ctrl+tab would make it go backwards trough your previous targets. so if you lost it, it’s just one tab to get the original target back, instead of scrolling trough everyone on your screen
---
How would you fix it? If there is something I really hate about vanilla it's how PvP becomes a race for the one-shot at better gear levels. Two people wearing AQ/Naxx gear will be so powerful offensively but so weak defensively that whoever attacks first just completely wrecks the other in one or two attacks. 
---
TBC reduced the item value of stamina by a third (or something like that) and implemented resilience to give players some defensive stat. I've never played TBC, but on paper it sounds like a good idea. Everyone seem to hate it though. What would be a better way to solve it?
---
That's great thanks, I'll try and remember to remove points in Shadow Focus once I get my Bloodvine set.
---
That's pretty interesting. Sorry, I didn't mean it as clickbait, to me it's just
---
It's an example of like you said, posts/threads actually making a difference, which is pretty awesome.
---
I like BfA. I mean its not perfect but it's not that bad.
---
Besides mounts, what are the advantages of repuatation for the main cities?
---
Lore-wise, Orcs are the first warlocks tho
---
The "without any obligations" means that you have no obligations towards the guild, not that family, children etc. aren't obligations.
---
&gt; Hey, sorry for the late reply. I think I obtained it from abandonware. I am looking for it there right now, but it appears to be both ToD and BtDP. Not the battle.net edition version. Let me keep looking
---
I saw this link today: https://www.gog.com/game/warcraft_bundle
---
I will check out if it's the correct stuff after work. 
---
CMON PPL ITS TIME TO BOOST THE PALADIN PARTY!
---
I had a macro in TBC to switch stance with shift + mouse wheel. It would switch to the "next" stance with wheel up, and go back to the previous stance with wheel down. Very useful, but require a little training.
---
Yeah, I don’t think there is much debate around classic dps rotations in PvE being simpler than retail rotations in general, same goes for difficulty and complexity of raid mechanics(up to Naxx at least). The complexity lies in the nuances and yeah, being able to get every bit of damage out as possible. 
---
I guess I was focusing more on PvP, because yeah, one frost mage to another in MC and BWL isn’t going to be that different from each other besides specific timings on abilities like evocation and spacing / movement. 
---
In WoD I was the first lvl 100 DK on my realm. They also removed feats of strengths for leveling in WoD.
---
I like getting attacked in the world, it makes the world feel dangerous and interactive. Some of my best memories are saving fellow players who were fighting an opponent in the open world. I have also made some friendships that way that are still present today. It's a huge part of the game to me, and being able to RP in the world while helping each other during times of war (battling factions) makes the game incredibly fun to me.
---
Brilliant, I also tried to get a GM to change the name of my hunter (Stuntkicks) because it was a 'highly offensive spoonerism'. I'm guessing the GM you spoke to had the same reply as the one I spoke to.
---
There is a "con" to hamstring kiting/earthbind kiting.  These all assume the main form of damage is "white" (auto) attacks.  In classes that have attack timer resets from skills (similar to Stormstrike for shaman, not sure a good example for warrior)  then your attack time goes down because you can AA-&gt;Stormstrike-&gt;Auto
---
In the instances where you can use attack resets to your advantage, it's better to just stay put for the reasons that are similar.  If you can stand still, use attack resets (resources like rage, mana, cooldowns) to shorten the fight, then you are also taking less damage in that regard.
---
The benefit to hamstring kiting is that it's less resource intensive, the con is that it generally increases the kill-time on an opponent/NPC and will use up resources faster.
---
And what complex and engaging systems did Vanilla have to offer? Grind mobs in the open world or go to a dungeon to press 1, or in extreme cases, 2 buttons. That's of course assuming you picked one of the few viable specs, if not, tough shit. No matter how simple you find the glowy button gamplay, class design is infinitely more engaging than Vanilla, as it has been at any point after Vanilla.
---
&gt;You dont even need to do well as a casual player as most likely one guy can solo carry. 
---
You mean kind of like BWL, MC, Onyxia, where you could bring 10-15 complete passengers? This gap will probably just increase with the amount of resources available to min-max today.
---
&gt;You can argue that M+ and guild raiding breaks this pattern of solo play but let's be honest a completely new guy isnt going to jump right into M+ or get an active guild.
---
Why are we assuming this? Its a big part of the game, and probably one of the few redeeming aspects of BfA.
---

It happened in Vanilla. Flying into Iron Forge on release week it would take 20 minutes to land.
---
Don't know what you're smoking but 50% of the server population isn't gonna be playing warriors.
---
You better get some glasses and go look on the survey results again.
---
There is no way you can kill the elementals in Arathi Highlands solo at level 30 bro..
---
It sounds like you are just a complete asshole who wants to flex a little bit on reddit. If I were your employer I’d probably fire you after seeing what a horrendous attitude you have towards random people on the internet. 
---
Personally I’ve no idea how long it might have taken for them to implement these changes, to me it could have been two week or two months, but ultimately it doesn’t matter at all because when it was communicated to the public is going to be your go live date. 
---
But seriously, stop being a huge asshat, you’re pretty much the exact type of person most of us don’t want to have to deal with on Classic servers. 
---
Man, Tirisfal Glades is low for how awesome it is.  It’s the one starting zone that actually takes the approach of “hey, this is what’s up with your new life” as NPCs around you respond to the horror of what they’ve become.  You dive straight in to your place in the world versus everyone else’s slow burn as their major plot gets revealed later (if the even got one).  Forsaken straight from the get go are “we’re fighting the scourge and the living who don’t differentiate between us and the scourge, now go find some nasty stuff to put in to our plague stew.”
---
Gotta remember that t3 includes more pieces of gear tho
---
The PvP gear in vanilla didn't scale very well though. The blue and epic sets were awesome when they first was made available, but come BWL and especially AQ it was made redundant. Hell the caster weapons were redundant at release. This will be a big problem on Classic because nowadays a lot more people will raid AQ and Naxx. The vast majority won't storm through it, but still a lot more than during vanilla. So the PvP gear is essentially useless after only a couple of months. Notable exception being the r14 weapons for melee.

Our raid team was:

😡🤪🤪🤪🤪

🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪
---
Lets remember that it was 2004, we have some much better hardware and better infrastructure, its unacceptable in modern day.
---
I remember having events, where we had easily over 100 players and this shit didnt happen. I hope they get it working in both classic and current wow.
---
Gotta say Ellwyn Forest. But greatest WOW reaction i experienced early game was running from Dun Morogh to Valley of Kings in Loch Modan. It was early morning when i decided to play before school and holy shit... Those Huge statues while running down path... I skipped whole day from school and slayed those damned troggs...
---
it depends on the situation but in most pvp its really not a one-shot scenario in the slightest.  why do you think iron grenades are such a big deal??  most classes have a couple of cc tools and yet more is needed - that goes completely counter to the idea of one-shotting or bursting people super fast
---
balance is not built around giving everybody 1000hp and 100dps.  Look at games like dota - that's not balanced at all in this respect.  sometimes you can literally 1-shot a person, sometimes you can do an instant-cast aoe that nukes most of an entire team from a safe distance.  sometimes the character that can do piss all damage but kill a tower is the most OP
---
having limitations is what makes multiplayer/pvp games exciting.  This is why dota, with it's turn rates, is better than LoL where you can turn instantly.  Yes it's annoying that sometimes you die because your character was turning to face the enemy before casting, but this feature enables a very detailed mini-game around harassment and skirmishing and prevents super easy kiting
---
and this is why vanilla (and tbc i guess) were the best.  you had a trinket and maybe 1 or 2 spells that might help you counter the enemy with a button but after that you had to make it work some other way
---
it is basically a mobile game on PC, nothing you do really matters and you can get anything in a few hours of playtime.
---
to say it isnt is to be disingenuous
---
Missed 
---
Stonetalon, tanaris, desolace, azshara, quite a few!! Missed others too just can't remember. Missed a lot of black rock area as well. 
---
I fully intend on going through zones I missed the first time around. 
---
Can't say I'm looking forward to silithus though if I'm honest!
---
This was TBC but on my server I was known as Dashammy a decent Shaman that had a good relationship with most guilds and contributed much to lower end, mid tier raiding and heroics. Never anything super but it was honest work.
---
My shaman was named Figgernaggot. I made it into my 40s before they made me change it. :( No ban though.
---
110 days until July 16th, so by this guys account we shouldn’t freak out until April 29th. At that time we start freaking out everyday that passes that we don’t have a release date. 
---
the satyr farm seems a bit unoptimal if u arent a mana user cuz u end up vendoring the bop runes
---
Anytime I have tried RP'ing on a none RP server I have been heavily abused for it. I find it's just not worth the hassle. Thats why RP-PVP was my favored server type.
---
The arctic wolf with its actual wolfish appearance are just so much nicer than the brutish mongrel wolves you see later in the content patches. Huge spiky collars, humongous teeth, glowy eyes, they are just ugh. 
---
I love me some unarmored wolf companion as mount!
---
He dropped 20% of his record in 13 years? Impossible! 
---
I always thought that was my shitty computer. 
---
I hope classic does so well they create legacy TBC or even WOTLK servers
---
Start a new account, and within a few hours down mythic jaina, put it on youtube and link it here please.
---
Damn... when you put it like that maybe I went a bit too hard.  
---
I'm sorry buddy.
---
a lot of people do SM clear to get bonebiter anyway and skip it. You can do SM at 38 and most people on a fresh can't get WW axe before like 37.
---
&gt; The initial cap (with sharding) at Classic launch will be 10k
---
When we talk about "pop cap" we mean the maximum number of simultaneous players, not of people who have a character on the server.
---
Isn’t bone biter alliance only?
---
you said if nost didn't happen there wouldn't be classic which just isn't the case.
---
Great response. Thank you.
---
As a warrior, I want to give my upfront apologies for always asking to roll on leather agi/crit gear in dungeons. Of course I wont straight up need on them, but I will always ask if it's fine as long as the others do not want the item.
---
Fully leathered up agi/crit warrior with double daggers = rogue in plate :c
---
No, because flying emptied the ground and got rid of any interaction in the open world. Was it convenient? -Absolutly. But it broke more things than it fixed. Even the developers admited to that in hindsight.
---
Vanilla cap was 2.5k at launch, maybe 3k later, nobody seems to be 100% sure.
---
I’d love to be able to obtain one of the original unarmored rams or one of the wolves. 
---
This is my rationalization now.
---
Going out is  expensive AF.
---
That hurts. I loved that game, I'm so sad it got shutdown. I hope someone will create some kind of private server for it.
---
Why do you need to share an account?
---
Oh god now they'll never shut up :)
---
&gt;Is there a source for xp values being correct? 
---
Yeah, open source. 
---
Idk about how you go by pressing one button, so I think you’re pretty shit. My level 16 warrior on classic is way more challenging than my level 120 paladin. 
---
Pretty sure the original Mounts will be in there for the first few month. Its really no big effort to change that and I don't see many people wanting the updated Mounts right from the start.
---
Can someone explain what this means? I don't know what spell batching is. I thought loot trading was a bad thing if I'm not mistaken? At least according to Nixxiom on Youtube.
---
&gt; I got banned from the forums because of a bunch of weenies right-clicking my post as trolling. I submitted a ticket and explained why I thought the post was not trolling.
---
strange
---
I got banned by some automat at the moment I made a post. I wrote a ticket, and never got a reply - had to wait like 24 hours. Plus, my computer was IPbanned for a week, and everything on the forums would throw either "404 not found" or "403 forbidden".
---
It might be a thing that will be different from private servers and not everyone will love it. If spell batching means visible server lag, people will complain. A lot of people know about vanilla only from private servers where that lag is not present. Given the choice, I would choose no server lag, because I don't really use those spell batching gimmicks and smooth gameplay is better for me. On the other hand, spell batching is likely to drastically improve performance of servers allowing more people at the same location. So may be it's worth it. Need to know all variables to decide
---
Shadow. Priest was my main in original wow vanilla. I absolutely love priest but wanted to change it up for Classic. I also mained Warlock in Wotlk so I'm not completely new to the class. But one of the best aspects of Warlock in Vanilla is how much utility the class comes with. Curses are highly sought after in raids. Summons make you a welcome sight in every group. Soul Stones make ganks much less annoying. Healthstones are awesome and people love you for them. All these things a Spriest does not have. Being able to dump your health for Mana makes questing and mob grinding a very interesting resource management game. Much different than mage and priest resource management. Warlock is just a great class in vanilla. And it's not a commonly picked class!
---
This talent works differently. It's not flat hit% it works kinda like spell pen but not really. For example if you fight warlock or another SP that has shit ton of shadow resistance maxed Shadow Focus will decrease change to resist even more than default 4%.
---
sorry ally player here :D yes on alliance you do it. Idk about horde.
---
Have an opinion or talk about something on the internet and you will receive death threats. Some people are ***angry*** about things.
---
As a warrior leveling the time saved because you gained a little extra rage wont come close to the 50% damage reduction.
---
Warriors with slow 2h weapons wont see any appreciable decrease in dps because as long as you time it right all your attacks will land as if you were always in contact with the enemy. 
---
I got autobanned the moment I made a post, and even appealed, but never get a response - didn't even get an email that the ticket was created. Had 24 hours to get my account unbanned, but could use it only on another computer - that one was IPbanned for a week
---
Weird, I was told blizzard devs don’t listen and purposefully make shit games. WHAT AM I MEANT TO BELIEVE?!?! I can’t possibly think for myself! 
---
/s BTW 
---
Mostly vendor prices I think. But epic mounts from another race is a pretty good status symbol.
---
So, she's a normal wife.  😀

Dun Morogh. Its where my WoW journey began so many years ago. My first character was a dwarf hunter and my real pet was an Ice Claw Bear I kept for a long time after. I love the snow capped mountains and the frozen lakes, and the music is wonderful there. It’s a shame it only ever plays in one other zone I believe, in Winterspring. 
---
&gt;Nothing honestly annoy me more than people who parrot what they read on some website without doing research to confirm if its actually true.
---
Just bookmarking this comment for future use.  Don't mind me.  
---
Just remember to cite every single piece of information that you make a [logical assumption](http://www.criticalthinking.org/pages/distinguishing-between-inferences-and-assumptions/484) for from now on ok?
---
10% discount and vanity.
---
I’ve just updated that Armor Sets chart he referenced to help players better see an apples-to-apples comparison of T3 vs. PVP gear. Having access to full T3 gear is not twice as good, but more like a 28% improvement (981AEP vs. 766AEP), which is still pretty significant. The PVP set provides a bit more stamina, but the T3 set makes up for it with increased offensive stats, especially AP and Crit.
---
With respect to the bracers and belt you were wondering about, the best items a non-raider could expect to get are actually the BoE Nightslayer pieces off the AH. Both are better than the PVP equivalents for those slots.
---
This poll went up on Mar 6th. It had 10,000 votes before I linked it to this sub.
---
Here is a mage rotation for raiding in Vanilla
---
-Frostbolt
---
Better hope it doesn't crit, because then you won't even be casting that for a while.
---
In going tailoring/skinning on my mage.  I think selling bags will make up for not having a 2nd gathering profession.  Ill drop skinning for engi at 60.
---
I just want it so i can take time off work so i can get fat and sweaty 
---
I guess they wanted to keep all names RP-friendly, and "black" is the most popular color of all electronics
---
Yes, I'm sure that's the reason.
---
They've got a pretty neutral stat line with a 5 % bonus to armor. They're great leveling pets ( and great tanks due to screech AoE threat) with decent damage output thanks to a spammable focus dump in the form of claw ( and bite,when you need that lil' bit of burst ) .
---
 Meat and fish is easy to come by so food shouldn't be an issue. The only thing that should worry you about carrion birds as a Horde hunter early-on is the fact that the only low level one that knows screech is located in Westfall.
---
If you're not up for a trip to Westfall,salt flats vultures,level 32-34 in Thousand Needles know screech rank two. Hope this helps !
---
You're a good dude, dude 
---
What's your point? That's not immersion breaking, that just makes me hate the enemy faction even more. 
---
Reddit survey isn't representative of real life servers
---
I play on a private server currently and I must say the number of warlocks is staggeringly high. I think people just want the free mount.
---
Because it's already been established that, with regards to leveling rate, private servers have been historically off -- using inflated TBC quest XP values for Vanilla quests.
---
It's not that I'm arguing that private servers are suddenly "off", but that they're probably not suddenly "on".
---
And yes, we should wait until Classic comes out before descending into name-calling over what is essentially an unknown. We agree on that.
---
Maybe on a dead server but I’ve been playing a very popular one and it’s always a fight for mob tags everywhere you go. Then every contested area has at least 2-3 douchenozzles on tap to yank every player they see for the 2hours they’re there. 
---
As people have stated, 100%.
---
As long as you know the mechanics of the fight and how to hold agro you should be fine. 
---
Keep a 1h and shield in your bags while leveling and make a weapon swapping macro for interrupts as you dont get pummel until late 30s. This will also help keep your weapon skill trained up.
---
Im curious how much do gravemoss and ghost mushrooms go for on ur server? the one with 3-5g felcloth
---
lucifer is on this list, under reserved names tab
---
&gt; Pservers are pretty fucking accurate dude.
---
hey "dude", I've contributed to open-source private server projects and if they were "pretty fucking accurate" then I guess I wouldn't have had to submit all of those change requests to fix mobs, mob behavior and pathing routes.
---
They are obviously accurate, but they are not correct. There's a difference.
---
I really liked your website, but can I make a suggestion?  It's been so long since I've played a rogue I forget what AEP and the other acronym stood for, so a key explaining what the acronyms meant would be helpful.  
---
My parents justified paying for 3 accounts because it was cheaper than going to the movies every weekend! Plus we got a hell of a lot of entertainment out of it. Still do haha
---
We are getting sharding to deal with tourists. The 3K caps will be fine once sharding is disabled.
---
I thought loot trading was bad
---
Okay, cool. What about Bats though? I just saw they can also learn screech and can ofc be found in Tirisfal. 
---
Got it. Yea, was leaning toward holy priest. But if I go DPS, I think it’ll be a Warlock. My main concern as a min-max player is their relatively lower DPS and their high threat issues.
---
24 hours of difference in-accurate because of mob pathing? OK 
---
&gt; Fully leathered up
---
&gt; in plate
---
This is a nice video
---
So what you're saying is that BFA is a winner?
---
It's soon April, and with each day my hopes for a July release slowly fades away. Blizzard pls :(
---
Thirty years from now I'll still have days when I just want to take it easy and play through Teldrassil. It's one of those things I keep coming back to and never get tired of. 
---
Boy, two links in one thread? I feel lucky!

---
Because assumptions (which is what imirak is doing) are based off of previous experiences. ( *An assumption is something we take for granted or presuppose. Usually it is something we previously learned and do not question. )*  
---
Generally speaking assumptions come from experiencing something from a position of authority, or receiving information from a position of authority.  (i.e.  if you're an apprentice woodworker, you take the word of a master woodworker as authority because he has experience.)  However, if you're a woodworker apprentice, under a master woodworker, but the woodworker union is in charge of you both, you take the work/experience of someone from the Union Leadership over your direct mentor. (In case it's not obvious, Joana is the "master woodworker" in this situation, but Blizzard is the "Union".  Private servers are the equivalent to a competing union.)
---
No-one is denying that Joana has experience speed running.  What they are criticizing is the veracity of the server(s) he/she is testing on.  Because PServers have been NOTORIOUS for missing something, and the simple fact of the matter is; the [Classic Demo at Blizzcon proved](https://classic.wowhead.com/news=290554/how-blizzard-verified-the-summoning-demon-behavior-for-classic-wow) that people explicitly [mis-remembered something from the past](https://www.facebook.com/trutvadamruinseverything/videos/the-memory-you-have-of-accidentally-letting-go-of-a-balloon-at-the-superhero-par/441891076013639/).

Laggerspine for me way back when playing from AUS

My wife never played any games whatsoever but seeing how I excited I am she said she's subbing with me to give it a try and spend time with me. Is this love?
---
I love this guy’s content. The Scooby Doo intro to the Shadowfang Keep Dungeon dive was gold. 
---
&gt; I mean PRIVATE SERVERS were the glory days of warriors 
---
FTFY
---
Before the rework (1.10 I think) it was definitely not the glory days. Without a heal bot it was not the glory days.  Without out gearing your enemies it wasn't the glory days.
---
If you look at any old videos, you'll see that rogues and mages are top in PvE. Yes warriors had the tanking niche but they were far from dominant elsewhere without massive gear and support.
---
Wow, I also missed stonetalon as well!
---
Wow, you skipped both STV and Ashenvale? Thats pretty big.
---
in 5mans with other casuals that also have green gear
---
probably before strat/scholo/brd
---
True true. 
---
appears to have wc1 and wc2, which should be cool. i never got to play wc1 even though I have the CD. my cousin scratched it too bad :(
---
It's the same deal with screech ,sadly no super low level bat knows it by default - so you'll have to make a Westfall or Thousand Needles trip. Speaking of bats overall they've got a pretty good offensive stat line ( the same as owls,give or take) + dive,though they can only learn bite. 
---
 I'd recommend them as leveling pets too if it wasn't for their slightly awkward diet of fruit and fungus ( when you're starting fresh,sometimes you'll have to spend a bit more silver at the vendor to feed your low - loyalty bat,unless you luck out with fruit drops).
---
Classic WoW is going to be an MMO like we had them 15-20 years ago, with more time investment needed, focusing on social interactions and grouping up with other players in the world. 
---
  The current iteration of WoW (BfA) represents how the game (and the genre) has changed over the past decade. It's more of a Sandbox game. It takes a lot less time to get to the max. level. It's a lot more focused on convenience. I'm not saying it's necessarily a bad game, it's just a completely different cup of tea. 
---
If you are familiar with the Elderscroll series, an good analogy would probably be a the changes in the game from Daggerfall/Morrowind to Skyrim. The game has become less about completly immersing yourself in the world and more about quick short term explorations/ gratification. 
---
Ofc I'm biased, but i know there is huge group of people (the majority probably) that prefers the current trends in gaming instead of what was the norm 15+ years ago.
---
&gt;Play on a private server, join a guild and get comfy with socialising with them, ask the
---
Do you play classic wow or do you play BFA on private server? 
---
Ahh god I might have to actually buy his guide a second time if it’s that much better. 
---
Do they have a table at PAX? I didn’t see one but I could have missed it.
---
&gt; Edit: mods might want to edit my flair to former or something. F 
---
\#NoChanges
---
Yep. Did not enjoy my leaving experience lol
---
&gt;Don't listen to most people here. There is a reason games like vanilla wow are extinct. 
---
You're god damn right, but the reason is not the one you are implying . 
---
It's because lobby based games with tons of microtransactions are making way more money, and are making this kind of money REALLY fast which is financially very appealing.
---
There is clearly a huge demand for games like Classic WoW, sure not as big as other popular tittles/genres, but the demand is there. 
---
Games like Vanilla WoW didn't go extinct because of demand, they went extinct because they were killed. They were killed to make room for more modern games that are much more capable on printing money.
---
The problem with retail is that there are so many negative changes that are now irreversible. For example, flying mounts, buying gold (tokens), LFG, too many new continents making Azeroth empty. If retail could address these problems, I genuinely think they could get back on track. Problem is.....they can't suddenly reverse these monumental design decisions, meaning the game is sort of stuck in it's current design state/philosophy. 
---
The point is I don’t buy your crocodile tears of “fair and immersion” when PvP has nothing to do with either.  
---
Shocked that Durotar is so low!
---
I know it sucks not having a release date, but look at it this way. In development, having a set release date almost always hurts the quality of the product. I have customers ask us all the time after we complete an enhancement for them, "When are we going to get this?" If you give them a set date, you're obligated to deliver on that time. This inevitably rushes the process for the rest of your product as well, which can (and almost always does) cause other things to go unnoticed. Bugs are rushed into release with insufficient testing and then you have to play catch up, patching everything you missed. For our own good, it's a blessing that we do not have a release date. Although I would very much like one...
---
Penisindabutt...... C'mon blizzard that one is funny
---
His experience is a fact. Your whataboutism and deflective arguments are disingenuous and you know it.
---
My beef with arenas was that they added the resilience stat to PVP-specific gear. I leveled on a PVP server. Whenever you encountered world PVP in Vanilla, it was usually a fair fight as far as gear was concerned.
---
With Resilience, you could be a pure PVE T4/T5 player and barely make a dent vs a starting PVPer. Personally, it made me resent PVP and turned me off to it altogether.
---
I ran the Wrath PVP zone only one single time...and got the Grand Black Mammoth.
---
Someone make a thread like that for AV !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! maybe someone already did but still can someone do it ?
---
Maybe 1.5 AV is in the works!
---
To be adequate on warrior just spam Bloodthirst.
---
To be exceptional, track bluffs, pool rage, dump at specific times. Level and use engineering items on CD between CDs. Monitor swing timer and dont clip auto attacks with HoJ procs, windfury etc. etc.
---
To be that warrior at the top is more complicated than you think. It isn't face roll on keyboard and profit like most people think, and I'll put money on Classic being more balanced in the DPS classes than private servers were. 
---
Downvote because I'm just presenting an opposing side to the situation?  LOL man redditors are such delicate snowflakes.  
---
You completely misread my post then.  (I actually don't know why I'm surprised, at this point I should be used to people skimming and just downvoting any post beyond a meme-shitpost, or another #nOcHaNgEs post)
---
But before I block you because of your idiocy/inability to read a post fully and your inevitable shitpost/spittle-fueled rage reply; let me educate/repeat what I said to you before, but simpler.
---
IF YOU AREN'T IN MELEE RANGE AS A WARRIOR, YOU AREN'T TAKING DAMAGE (GAINING RAGE), AND YOU AREN'T USING ANY INSTANT ATTACK RESETS (SPENDING RAGE), YOU ARE DOING ONLY WHITE (AUTO) DAMAGE.  YOUR KILL TIME WILL GO UP, BUT YOUR GRINDING EFFICACY WILL GO UP A LITTLE AS WELL.  OVER THE LONG TERM GRINDING SAMPLES THIS WILL EVEN OUT, BUT IF YOUR GOAL IS FOR A QUEST/SPECIFIC # OF KILLS TO COMPLETE A QUEST, THEN YOUR SHORT TERM SAMPLE KILL TIMES WILL GO DOWN.
---
TLDR: IF YOUR GOAL IS TO KILL AN ELITE THAT IS F\*\*KING HARD: HAMSTRING KITING IS A GOOD STRATEGY.  IF YOUR GOAL IS TO GRIND ALL DAY WHILE TAKING ZERO DAMAGE: YOU SHOULD PROBABLY CONSIDER RE-ROLLING A MAGE.
---
Super under appreciated. So much talent
---
Pretty lax is an understatement. I still play retail almost entirely for RP and PvP and I’ve had several instances of trolls coming to disrupt IC interactions by using huge, obnoxiously loud mounts, growth potions and toys. When I ticketed blizzard about it they said simply that they ‘were not breaking any rules’ even though RP realms are supposed to have those rules in place to prevent that kind of thing.
---
I still listen to the teldrassil enchanted forest soundtrack from time to time like a fucking nerd.
---
I actually agree with this. It's nice to set a single goal and work towards it. Then when you have it, you can be content in your accomplishment. Nothing wrong with adding new content such as instances, as long as it's done in the right way.
---
Private servers are unauthorized servers hosted by fans to emulate past versions of the game. I’d be very, very surprised if there are BFA private servers out there. Still, I’d suggest you avoid them. Blizzard doesn’t much care for them for obvious reasons, and they’ll be pretty useless once Classic goes live.
---
still the difference will be minimal
---
If you come across someone in WoW(or life) that you can tell feels this way. Help them out. Be nice above all else.
---
I am doubting that this is vanilla because the BQ que announcer didn't exist back then. 
---
Oh man I’m not. I’m actually surprised it received any votes at all hah. 
---
Yea I don’t understand how this meme expresses that.
---
🤷‍♂️
---
I probably was the orc male with the biggest dresses collection in Orgrimmar. Perhaps hordeside! Favorite was moon festival pink one. :)
---
Yes*
---
You will be killing everything required for other quests anyway. So it makes sense to pick it up.
---
If you are ahead of the curve dont expect to get it before 36-40 unless you get a full group to help. If you are in the pack I'd imagine that you will see 4-5 warriors there all trying to get it. So grouping wont be as necessary. You may also be able to get the charms of the AH, and trade threat between 3-4 people to being him down.
---
At the time, I had a quad core PC, with a decent graphics card and like 4 GB of RAM. I didn't lag much tbh, not even in IF 
---
Well you're more than welcome to post it as I'm sure they'll gladly tell you that there's nothing special about being a software developer in 2019. Except that, you know, we have some insight on the fact that you can't just flip a switch and implement a whole ton of shit in a major complex game in just two weeks.
---
If it helps at all, basically every class will seem overpopulated. Few games are as popular as WoW, and unless you're playing some incredibly obscure spec, it'll be hard to feel all that unique. 
---
And despite being the number 1 class, warriors will always be needed. Tanks are ALWAYS too scarce throughout the game, and for end-game raiding warrior DPS will be the biggest slot to fill, since they're OP AF. 
---
And I guess the cool thing about classic is that unanticipated nerfs are a non-factor, since the game is meant to be a preservation of an already "balanced" period, and any changes would defeat that purpose. 
---
Please don't.. that limits them to a date. I want it done right not done fast.
---
Me too. I played ed a bit but never got super into it and stopped at 48ish. Couple years later I found nostalrius when bored and no lifed it to level 30. Woke up the next morning and saw the shut down thing. I had no idea how big this all was. I’ve been playing regularly since switching to other priv servers with the highest pop n freshes ofc. 
---
so happy I graduated college right as I got back into it. I had all cs in middle school Bc of this game. 
---
&gt; There's no changes to how the game works on a fundamental level
---
It is a massive change to how the game works on a fundamental level.
---
I am not saying you are not allowed to like it, but it's a far bigger change than something like fixing enhance shamans.
---
Do you not understand that the entire game is essentially based around a conflict between two warring factions? Can you not comprehend how being unable to attack a member the opposing faction ruins the game for those of us who want to immerse ourselves in it? 
---
I'm merely responding in kind. People here on reddit get a bit too complacent with the circlejerking and thinking you know it all. Getting called out on that sucks for some.
---
If you want someone to be fired for a discussion on reddit which involved nothing but actual facts, you may be taking reddit a bit too serious. But that's kind of what I mean by most of you all being young and naive, and seeming to fail to understand how the world works.
---
The answer was always known. You just haven't paid attention. It will come to a full circle once it will be released.
---
Hint: it's in the first sentence of the cinematic.
---
&gt; Ofcourse they do. Why wouldnt they?
---
Respawn rate is the single most massively obvious thing. But depending on the server they can have things like 1.1 pet damage combined with 1.12 hunter damage for OP monstrosities never seen in retail.
---
I don't think the mats are really the problem. I believe the issue is it is hard to market them as they can't be sold on the AH as a sort of set it and forget it style sale. You have to advertise and sit around in main cities to sell enchants.
---
&gt; Yes, but it's hard as hell to find a 5man dungeon as a druid tank since people hate you.
---
That might have been the case 12 years ago but certainly isn't anymore. I personally never had anyting against druids.
---
Right now, Druids are all but "hated" regardless of the role. They get invited into groups as tanks all the time. I never heard any complaints about Druid tanks ever since playing vanilla again.
---
Thats true, but to be fair lot of those turks actually lived in countries like the netherlands, belgium and germany ive found out
---
i dont get it
---
By taking less damage you also decrease the time in between fights, which is then not used on first-aiding/eating. There is a reason people hamstring kite while leveling, it is the fastest way if you take regaining health into consideration. The only instant attack for warriors ti'll level 40 is hamstring and overpower ;) 
---
Also the downvotes are probably due to your attitude
---
One guy didn't change their mind. His post started a snowball effect on the forums which lead to open discussion. 
---
Thank you, the less thoughtless code in the world from people who can't adapt to new systems, the easier everyone else's jobs get!
---
Best of luck in your future.
---
"Listen here you lil shit"
---
There is a BFA PVP spot on the schedule for today.
---
Big mood
---
Poetic.
---
I understand your point. But waiting too long will limit alot of people from playing. And I think they have done a very good job already. Not saying I don't want it to be perfect, but I can't really enjoy the game if I can't play it. The smallest of tweeks now won't ruin my whole experience I think. But I want it to be a finished product of course. I don't want it right NOW! 
---
There isn't an open source resource for vanilla wow values.
---
I get the CC thing and CC breaker spells that every class has nowadays. That's bad. What I don't get is how resilience doesn't fix the high burst that is typical of late-game vanilla PvP. Iron grenades are only good because they allow you to setup the one-shot combo. Pretty much every class except priest can kill anyone in one or two GCDs. And that's regardless of the victim's gear. As an AQ geared warlock my trinketed soulfire will hit for 4-5k and even more in Naxx gear, but my health remains relatively unchanged from MC gear to Naxx gear. So when I meet a warrior I'll just blast him into the ground with an easy combo, unless of course he opens on me and smashes me into the ground before I can do anything. 
---
This imo is the biggest problem with vanilla PvP and is one of the reasons why most private servers drop significantly in population after AQ is out. On paper it seems like resilience fixes this. It makes the combat a bit longer, at least on paper. As I said before, I've never played it. But why do everyone hate resilience? 
---
I was noodling on this yesterday as I was playing BFA (mostly just to get a fix before classic). As I'm questing, I regularly pull 5-7 mobs by accident and then have no trouble downing all of them. Its absolutely bonkers. It's gotten to the point where I now pull 5-7 mobs intentionally, lol. All challenge is gone from the overworld.
---
No pservers had warrior population over 30% as far as i know and most was at around 20% warriors
---
I wouldn't worry about the DPS. Apparently they become God tier later in Naxx etc. Also if you want to heal then for sure go holy priest
---
The problem is they have grown Retail like a cancer. My Theory is Classic is in fact a reboot that if successful will consume retail in the future.
---
He had us in the first half not gonna lie 
---
I've said it a few times but,
---
They need to release the server's early and allow players to create 1 character per account that is unable to log into the world.
---
That way they can;
---
#1 get people to sub before the release, more $$ for them
---
#2 see what the population is looking like, and adjust server's accordingly
---
#3 allows players to reserve names
---
#4 allows friends and guilds to set themselves up
---
#5 gives us a choice on playing a maxed out server, or one that's a bit emptier without queue times
---
#6 give them data, data, data so they can iron out any issues that night come up
---
I'm sure there's more perks to this
---
Can someone ELI5 spell batching, please?
---
This guy is what's up.  As an OT that dps'd rarely on a private server, it isn't easy to match the DPS of a good fury warrior... hence why I think I'm gonna roll Mage for Classic (kind of want an easy raid experience coupled with easy gold farming).
---
That was an example of "fucking accurate" things that had to be fixed. There are obviously lots of other inaccuracies in pserver code.
---
I’m sitting on fat vacation days. Think I got like 4 days or so carried over from last year and another 20 still. My gf keeps asking why I haven’t taken time off and I can’t tell her why. 
---
Then you shouldn't want them to be limited to a date. Do you want to login and have constant disconnects and lag followed by broken spawn points and clipping mobs? I know I don't. 
---
You're right, I foolishly thought fear ward wasn't that important since horde don't get it and they raid just fine.. but they have tremor totems instead. 
---
Durotar is definitely cozy, but it’s kind of a mess layout wise, having this weird path of running to Sen’jin, then to Razor Hill, and then back to the Echo Isles because Zalazane is level 10-12-ish surrounded by more trolls, and if you do it first anyway, you still have to come back for raptor eggs.  
---
I had someone send me death threats for playing control warrior in hearthstone... albeit that's deserved 
---
Here is the attack table for PvP at even level before gear:
---
Miss : 5%
---
Dodge : 5%
---
Parry : 5%
---
Block : 0%*
---
Crit : 5%
---
Regular Hit : 80%
---
Results higher on the table will "push off" or override those lower on the table.
---
If you get another 1% crit think about it as changing a regular hit into a crit. In PvP you can see that there is plenty of room for more crit.
---
Crit cap is really more of a thing in PvE, where you have an additional 3-19% miss chance as well as 10-40% glancing. 
---
lol. You just can't get over the fact that your "8 years of experience" doesn't really mean a lot in the software development world.
---
I'm so glad someone else feels this way. I came to the comments looking for answers and I'm leaving even more disappointed than when I looked at the meme.
---
O rly?
---
You understand that is like winning a 100 meter race against a bunch of one legged retards right?  
---
Don't use words you don't know the meaning of. I know you are probably too deluded to accept any other reality, but people's experiences in a game can vary.
---
spellbatching isn't lag though. 
---
Even though I prefer Horde, it's always been very obvious to me that a lot more thought and attention went into the alliance starting zones.
---
Teldrassil is my favorite, but Elwynn and Dun Morogh are also well fleshed out.
---
I don't think anyone does. The bar is very low for classic posts I guess.
---
Too bad it's a horde guide... 
---
Cool. I was just looking at the map a couple weeks ago and didn't see anything. The map was hard to find anything in haha.
---
Oh well
---
A shithole only an orc could love
---
I think I spent a whole weekend playing all the time and only managed to get lvl 36-40 as a hunter. I was constantly trying to just find a quest hub and couldn’t. When I look back at it I missed a ton of spots. I’ve gotten leveling down pat for horde and have it almost all together for alliance now but damn I was so lost back then it kind of demotivated me every time I got to like level 20 or 30 
---
What, do you have to pay for his guide? 
---
Maybe I'm combining a bit of my love for the Barrens with it. Or maybe I'm just used to it, who knows.
---
You start off by calling someone disingenuous and then go on to commit the exact same offense yourself.
---
Calling BfA a mobile game is probably a bit too much, I agree. But your "summary" of Vanilla gameplay is just as extreme and untrue.
---
Can anyone explain to me what's spell batching
---
Yeah, I still don't get it.
---
Good to hear. Sorry for sounding like a douche. Good on ya taking it in a constructive manner. 
---
I just felty heart deflate and squish after I imagined them saying "psyche, we were never gonna do WoW classic suckers!"
---
Under the premise that a server is stuck at 8k concurrent players that's the logical step.
---
And it is what happened in 2005. At least in Europe.
---
I was thinking about mapping it to one of my keys. Like on one tap it would use a certain ability and on the second tap it would switch the stance.
---
Your solution also seems pretty nice.
---
I got my first summer job so that I could save up for a computer that could run WOW. Probably one of my better investments since I could afford my subscription all school-year long until summer rolled around next year. 
---
Good times.
---
I would say play BFA, get a feel for it and if you don't like it definetly try classic.
---
Shit. Well I guess Bigtittys is off the table then.
---
mulgore 2nd lowest? guys you are breaking my heart
---
I think there was also a comment that one of the original game designers actually wanted a SMALLER population cap to foster a greater sense of small community. This was probably before the game blew up like it did.
---
It's just a trade-off between access to resources (nodes, spawns) and the ease of grouping and community activity. On some very high-pop pservers, it's great that I can find a group for a lot of dungeons in a very reasonable amount of time. The trade-off that they came up with was dynamic respawns. If you don't want to manage dynamic respawns for balance reasons (or other reason) then it will be more important to stay in synch with other players to ensure you can actually find a group for many activities.
---
Ive seen a lot of records to 60 and average play times being posted.  I would be curious to know what the average play time to each of the 10s are... so average to 10, 20, 30, 40, 50.   For /played.. obviously Joana's going to be significantly faster.
---
Though I would be interested to seeing the alliance version and curious how well it would work for a rogue or other non-pet classes (probably works just fine for warlocks too)
---
Hello mate! For paladin, are you thinking about a 25/26 holy reckoning spec? In that case i guess the pally can be a nightfall bot or heal depending on the need/raid composition right?
---
Ahh I see I think, so I need 4% hit as well as this talent?
---
&gt;It's because lobby based games with tons of microtransactions are making way more money, and are making this kind of money REALLY fast which is financially very appealing.
---
They make more money because more people want to play them. Even if they disappeared the world has moved on, MMO's aren't what they were 15 years ago.
---
My wife enjoyed Tera and BDO but she hates WoW unfortunately. 
---
Most parses from Naxx still have them behind Warr, Rogue and Mage, but even so, while I’d love to clear Naxx, who knows how it all goes.
---
And yea, I’ve never raid healed before, so I thought it could be a fun change of pace. Most of my serious raiding has been done as a Mage.
---
Dun Morogh. The snowy mountain environment is just gorgeous and that *music*!
---
one person already has it, though
---
I saw someone on a private server named Toiletplumber. 
---
?????
---
I would have loved to have been there when someone shouted the n word.
---
Because it flattens things and is boring.  The whole point is that a warlock mage or rogue is a bit of a glass cannon but with some tricks for helping them do their thing, whereas a pala is the opposite.  With resilience it's like everyone does similar dps and it's dull.  In theory it's a good idea but its a lazy fix! You don't balance games by taking the flavour out, you do it by tweaking people's tools.  I think the warlock teleport portal thing was one of the best changes because that gives them an extra option against melee and possibly for LoS if you play it right - but it's not fundamentally changing the game
---
Yeah vanilla pvp isn't exactly balanced for duels but I'm happy with it and enjoy it, especially in the chaotic world pvp and ganking side
---
Again, if everyone can nuke inside of 2 globals then iron grenades would not be used because most classes can buy 2 globals worth of time without them - and yet all serious pvpers have them 
---
I can't wait to tank the fuck out of people using the guide a week or two after launch where it's gone from a huge surge to a steady stream.
---
I'm imagining we "might" have servers named like "The Underbog - Classic" or even just simply with the same names since the client is diff right?
---
If so stay off The Underbog if you plan on leveling Alliance using the Joanna guide and you don't like PvP.  😘
---
One day less than his previous record might seem unreal but its possible. Back then he didnt use some basic addons like aa timer , lazypig etc so only from that he could easily save a lot of time. I guess he optimized some mistakes from his previous route aswell , so thats definately possible.
---
Gummy died for his own sins.... and turned out to help us out in his dieing breath
---
Oh wow all I sudden I am hyped.
---
are you dumb? 
---
I gotta know - why is everything 'as fuck'?
---
BFA is an irritating N, classic (well vanilla)... is an Italian stallion :P
---
No, you get 4% if opponent has 0 shadow resistance so the more resistance oponnent has the more you need points in this talent         ( shadow priest, warlock and undead race has a lot of it )
---
I was actually talking about disenchanting and selling the mats.
---
Sorry, I wasnt being clear in my original comment :p
---
I downvoted you because it was off topic, you were talking about Shamans etc. and what you offered up didn't apply to the warrior discussion. This is how reddit is supposed to work.
---
On the other hand blowing up like this because of -1 internet points is very special...
---
I got a 7 day van and a name change for my undead mage “Lollocaust”. Being an edgy teen was fun. I was also genuinely(ish) surprised when my human warrior “Gaylórd” got name changed, since Gaylord is actually a name - my iPhone’s autocorrect even agrees with me on this one.
---
Could you point out which part is extreme and untrue?
---
They eyes on the left owl appear to be bored or disinterested in whatever it is seeing. The owl on the right is looking around the corner interested in something that it sees in the distance 
---
But what's wrong with Creed? I thought it was an awesome movie. Creed 2 was just as good imo
---
It’s really not that complicated 
---
I'm ok with that, the end result is the same, max level character without the struggle. Tbh I've only done it with shit leveling classes like druid priest warr due to frustration of dieing lmao 
---
The most important thing in classic/vanilla is to engage with other players, dont be afraid of interaction. Quests can still be boring and it takes a long time to level, but the actual dangers of the world(compared to the hack'n slay that is retail) and binding together with other players is what makes this version of the game so much more immersive and satisfying than current BfA.
---
Probably hunter seeing they are the quickest and almost twink it out with boe and enchants early on to speed up progress. If you dont mind investing some gold into items and consumables I'm sure you could get really strong gear early on through the AH and become a semi twink
---
Right mis-remembering how a specific summon mechanic proves that pservers are completely inaccurate.
---
Shat is also the ugliest zone ever made. Nobody's PC could handle two factions in one capital so they split the city in two and made it as bland as possible. 
---
Huge double d tits on night elves
---
Can someone explain to me what spell batching is
---
Historically off? So something was wrong, it was fixed, but yet it is still wrong?
---
That's like saying that classic is historically off because classic had errors... 
---
Rocky 1,2,3 are masterpieces, creed is just a wannabe.
---
You missed the issue. You could have done nothing, but if 3-4 people organized and reported you *without cause*, you can't do anything about it. A few trolls could effectively lock you out of dungeon groups until a GM reviews even if you did nothing.
---
Using engineering items is for the 0.1% tryhards. Good for them I guess.
---
The rest will be using the Bloodthirst - Whirlwind - Heroic Strike (and maybe swapping for Overpower) rotation, and monitor buffs like Crusader (just like most raiders have been monitoring trinkets using addons forever). 
---
Aside from a few scenarios, that don't really matter except for speed running, like sapper charges being big dmg on trash, the difference won't be significant, and anyone who thinks vanilla raiding involved difficult rotations is living in another world.
---
September 22nd, there you go
---
I'm level 48 so I do think I'll be able to lol
---
Opinions opinions..
---
I'm starting to think it might just not be funny.
---
What’s more interesting is if they decide to use the old mount system where you only learned the skill for one type of mount(tiger riding etc) and the actual mount itself was the expensive part. 
---
I agree with you 100% it is just that some people would argue that any population under 7k is dead. Just wanted to counter balance that point a bit.
---
Why would you even conjure this thought into reality you sick fuck?
---
Justice
---
I'm thinking about opening a Warrior purely for DPS and PvP at 60. I've been told that for DPS, I should for for Fury/arms with 2h for leveling (since there are not a lot of +hit items for dual wield before the endgame?) and at 60 go for dual wield and switch to Fury.  
---
As for DPS, i've been suggested to go Arms for MS and 2h ofc.
---
I'd like to know what you guys think. Suggestions for builds are more than welcomed. 
---
&gt;it just seems to be something over-idealized. People talk about how your character looks like a hobo during leveling, and finally reaching that endgame state where you have sleek, uniform looking gear that goes well together. 
---
This is made up in your head, I don't know where you are getting it from. And your entire post revolves around this made up thing.
---
I'd love for them to be in, and I'd like for us to have confirmation before launch, because unarmored epic mounts will literally decide what class I play (undead warlock if no mounts, troll mage if they are in).
---
When unarmored mounts were around in Vanilla, you could only get the Raptors as a troll since there weren't enough quests to hit Exalted with Darkspear and there were no cloth turn ins. If that is the case for classic as well, I'm going troll to get that Mottled Red Raptor
---
You do realize its a better scenario to not have a date than it is to say a release date and have unseen delays that move it back right? Everyone would have their vacation from work set for the wrong time and most people wouldn't be able to change it, there would be riots here.
---
Also, I don't understand how them not having a date limits anyone from playing. The game will be ready when its ready and people can play it whenever they want, you don't have to start playing the very second its released. 
---
any proof ?
---
Mine is Ellwyn but Durotar is a close second. My first toon in vanilla was an orc warrior. I cant remember how often I died to that witch doctor on the echo Islands.
---
It’d be cool if they scrambled the levels of zones so it’s not as quite a steamroll and there’s this be some aspect of learning. Everyone knows pretty much everything about the game now and it’s no secret it’s not going to be quite as intriguing and challenging as it used to be. I know a lot of players will do fine with zones scrambled up and steamroll anyway but for people who don’t know everything about the game it’d be pretty fun. What used to be an easy mob to kill would not require kitong at x level or what used to be hard might be easy. Just some aspect of nuance instead of a carbon copy of what I already experienced.
---
I don’t exactly want this in the game as I’m a no changes kinda guy but it’s all I could think of
---
The key to durotar is to grab the razor hill quests first, and grind while walking there. That way u grab the raptor egg quest for echo isles. Then u do the kirin tor quests with canvas scraps and from there go to echo isles/other senjin village quests Usually there’s always someone else doing Zalazane anyways, so I always lfg. When ur done u have a ton of quests to turn in. U kind of skip a level almost. 
---
Don’t forget to set ur hearth at razor hill as well. 
---
Facts, they are redoing vanilla. You will never see a creed remake, like noone will do a BFA remake man.
---
&gt;How is killing a quest NPC griefing? 
---
Once? No. Camping them? Yes. You're halting progress for other players. This has *always* been the position of Blizzard. That's one of the reason DHKs exist. 
---
&gt;So there shouldn't be any town/city attacks? What??
---
Sure, but there should be limits. Just like for corpse camping, some players need limits set on them or they'll just grief other players for the sake of it.
---
&gt;Just call for help in the local defense channel, that's how world PvP works.
---
In an ideal world, sure. Does it work on 1:2 servers? Sure. Does it work on 1:10? No. 1:20? definitely not.
---
DHKs exist to *discourage* bad behavior. Nothing *stops* you from killing quest NPCs, but you certainly shouldn't benefit from it or get by with killing civilians with no repercussions. The vanilla lore just doesn't support slaughtering civilians.
---
Can you sell items for more? Or is it just that items are cheaper for you to buy?
---
Where in my original post did I display ANY attitude what so ever?  (NOT my 2nd post with the allcaps).  
---
I'll make it easy for you, I didnt. All I did was present an opposing side to a debate for theorizing/analysis purposes.  My 2nd reply was due to the downvote/inability for the guy to fully read/comprehend a post which infuriates me beyond belief.  
---
Druid is a great leveling class.  Feral spec, really hits its stride around level 25-30 before then is tedious.  But the same can be said for many classes!
---
If you just look at his gameplay from the vods it's very clear that his speedrun while it had very efficient routing(which has now been improved a bit further), the actual gameplay is very lackluster and he could've done so much more to minmax speed, like kiting, doubleattacking(using both melee and bow at same time), autolooting etc. A lot of credit to the guy of course because he played very well for someone 14 years ago, and now it would seem he has improved.
---
But people are just gonna blame it on pservers undermining his achievement until actual classic comes out and joana does the same speed as he is doing now.
---
* Implying that Vanilla has no interesting features besides grinding mobs. **Untrue**
---
* Saying you don't need to use more than two abilties in a dungeon. **Untrue**
---
* Suggesting BfA has "by far" the more engaging class design. **Subjective**
---
I don't even know why you're in here arguing. It's like being at an Iron Maiden concert, trying to tell them why they should go see Britney Spears instead.
---
What is your favorite race for Warrior and why is it Gnome?
---
That user name checks out.
---
You seem to be completely deluded to the fact that you started the hostility. It was literally all your doing. I would absolutely fire an employee like you that seems to be incapable of seeing how detrimental their own actions are. 
---
You immediately interjected into the conversation with a superior attitude and came off as incredibly obnoxious. You are the quintessential pedant. 
---
I feel sorry for any company who ends up employing you with your terrible attitude. 
---
But after all and as you said this is the internet, I just feel like a cocky asshole should be called out on it when I see it. 
---
Best of luck to you, maybe one day you can get that massive chip off your shoulder 
---
I grinded elites in tyrs hand/hearthglen for my epic mount. Was actually one of the first on the server to get it.  Lots of runecloth and thorium mines.  Occasional rare/epic to sell.
---
I've watched 3 minutes so far and noticed the following desprepencies:
---
1. 30% of your attacks will be glancing blows.
---
2. hitcap is 27% for dualwield (not 17%).
---
I believe they are going to be like they were in classic and be server only. I haven't seen news otherwise at least.
---
The sense of rewardment is subjective my guy. It seems that you feel rewarded for aesthetics were as others feel rewarded by the progress of killing the boss or crafting a BiS item
---
Eat lots of desserts and get all fat and sassy.
---
Amazing post, I was going to do this myself before I realised how long it would take. You're doing Elune's work.
---
He is playing on a solo server which means the respawn rate is blizzlike.
---
Depending on server, what exact server? Are you talking about Lupos or  It is 1.12 everything the server he is playing on because the run he made was for 1.12
---
Classic, start on equal footing with everyone else
---
Some of these people don't really care if it doesn't fix their 'private servers bad' narrative.
---
"Most private servers have had their quest XP fixed for about a year now"
---
"LA LA LA LA LA LA LA I CAN'T HEAR YOU I CAN'T HEAR YOU"
---
Basically the game is applying spells and effects in batches of time. For instance (these numbers are being made up) every 1/4 it does a check of all the spells finishing their cast and applies it in one batch. So if you got your polymorph off slightly ahead of the other mage (such as you getting your polymorph off at 0.11 seconds and they get theirs off of .21 seconds) they will both still count as going off at the same time and you will both be polymorphed.
---
Retail wow has both higher rates of batches (so for instance, they might batch every .125 seconds instead of .25 seconds, so the game would register your .11 cast in the first batch and interrupts their .21 second cast because it would've been in the second batch) as well as something about batching priorities where some things will override other effects if they are in the same batch.
---
If you consider how inefficient the gameplay is on his vods compared to players nowadays and that he has made several improvements on his route, it's not really that huge.
---
Since you are asking for opinions I say play fury. 
---
Even if ret is fun, and even if it is somewhat viable I don't see you having a fun time always having to convince guilds and/or raid leaders to let you join as ret. Esvand can get into raids because he is a popular streamer, not because ret is good. Don't get me wrong, I like paladin, and I like ret. Thematically ret is awesome, in a practical sense it has a stigma though (whether it warranted or not).
---
I honestly think being able to get into raids and play through content without constantly having to justify your presence will be more fun in the long run. So fury warrior.
---
Ultimately, do what you want dude. 
---
If you want to be purely melee dps, go rogue. 
---
Guilds will require you to have a tank set and you won't make very many friends without one. Why would a tank warrior take a dps warrior to a dungeon when the dps warrior is just going to take the gear? You'll have an awful time gearing up. 
---
You might get lucky and find a raid spot. If you refuse to tank an add on domo/4hm/etc you will find yourself replaced by someone who will.
---
If they announce a date they can't change it because gamers would freak out, so they'd feel forced to release on time which could cause the product to be worse / missing something.   
---
Blizzards methodology with this sort of thing has always been to wait for any releases / announcements until it is ready. There's a reason "soonTM" became a meme. They've never wanted to give confirmation on a release unless it we 100% certain. 
---
Nano hasn't worked on pservers for like 2 years.
---
How can you make a source about something being correct. How about you find any sort of proof that it is wrong? You have a open source project and a full 1-60 vanilla gameplay vod to work with. 
---
Looks like warriors, that actually use tier sets (prot), wear their tier helmet.
---
It's easy to justify when the alternative is going out &amp; spending money on various food services, transportation, etc. WoW is a cheap alternative actually.
---
&gt;And what complex and engaging systems did Vanilla have to offer?
---
Community. People to grind mobs *with*
---
He's talking about the DHKs.  You know, the topic of this thread.
---
Of course, Joanna spends hours and hours planning and testing routes. 
---
Without enough return on the guides these pros will just stop making them.
---
People have this idea that the best ideas just rise to the top and we'll all know in a few weeks how to level as fast as Joanna. That's just not true. 
---
Think of this guide as paying for an education. The person offering that education can't live withoit a salary or hourly wage. If somebody was gonna teach you how to weld or paint you would expect them to want money.
---
Cheaper to buy.
---
Unfortunately, I cannot directly link to the post because of the subreddit's rules so you'll have to take my word I'm copy / pasting it from there and not just making this up:
---
We've looked through the Master Guide book and of the randomly selected quests we found and matched with Joanas levelling guide, every single one of them had the same experience listed. With tremendous help, we've been able to change every single quest in preperation for [redacted]. The new values have been applied to the PTR and should be ready for [redacted].
---
It means basically:
---
3154 quests have had their experience reward changed (most have been lowered)
---
1180 quests have had their minimum level requirement changed (most have been lowered)
---
181 quests have had their level changed (this only makes a difference if you are completing quests several levels below yourself, in that they won't reward the full experience)
---
A Mage trainer in Darnassus
---
There is no better feeling than having a bis piece of gear. Wich is something that is imposible to get in retail.
---
Looking like a clown in full bis gear is something people look up to. People care way less about the looks and more about the pieces itself. 
---
Transmog ruint part of the feeling of having a good piece of gear. Being a show-off is fun.
---
&gt; I'd personally like to see stress test how well the servers perform without sharding and realms being capped.
---
The sharding is more for playability than server load. Starting zones are not meant for the rush of people that will be crowded into them and a bad launch where you fight for hours to tag enough mobs to get out of valley of trials is not what they are looking to have. I don't know what you mean by server cap, but if you mean population I would assume the same as vanilla, 2.5k which the game was designed for.
---
Ok, well, enjoy your delusions that you'll be selling them for 200-300g.  You won't, but if it helps you calm down: You're right...there's absolutely no way whatsoever that pservs have even remotely correct info, they may as well not even be vanilla.  They definitely did not compaign for classic and aren't the reason we're here having this conversation today.  They know nothing....like Jon Snow.
---
Remove world buffs (at least the most annoying ones).  It would simultaneously made the content more challenging and less annoying to prep for.  Even some of the high-profile content creators have said they wouldn't mind if this happened.
---
Have to say Mulgore. Always loved those large green planes filled with wildlife. Might not be the best for questing, but it is beautiful. 
---
wait for classic and let it blow your mind, dont even prepare or research it just jump straight into it like we all did years ago
---
Which is crazy, because you can definitely smell them from a mile away. Not very stealthy. 
---
&gt;Implying that Vanilla has no interesting features besides grinding mobs
---
Tell me about some of these complex endgame features then. I like how you responded to every single point by just saying untrue and not providing a single example.
---
&gt;Saying you don't need to use more than two abilties in a dungeon.
---
Using mage as an example, you will Frostbolt to single target, and sometimes Blizzard for AoE. Sure there are exceptions and niche situations but I didn't claim otherwise. 95% of gameplay will be pressing Frostbolt
---
&gt;Suggesting BfA has "by far" the more engaging class design
---
Could you point out a single class/spec which has more complex gameplay in vanilla than it does currently? Just gonna ignore that some specs are completely unplayable.
---
Actually its more like somebody asking if they should see Iron Maiden or Britney Spears. Look at the title of the thread.
---
People focus on BiS too much without considering that there very likely could be 10 other guys that are the same role in the raid who also want that gear, one of you is going to end up wearing some tier even if it isn't bis because the chances of getting the same bis off piece shoulders 10 times in a reasonable time frame is extremely unlikely.
---
‘I put a lot of mindless effort into this. Admire me!’
---
truth
---
I've played healer for a long time and I also had a warrior on a pserver. You can tank as arms up until the latter half of BRD. At 60 when you're still in leveling greens you'll need to respec prot or at least 11 points in prot until you get maybe half of your pre-raid bis set. If you don't, you'll have a hard time in dungeons when a healer who is also in quest greens is trying to heal you. Agro won't be a problem but staying alive will be. Meet your healer half way, they spec resto/holy and you go prot.
---
Seriously! Definitely #2 to Elwynn. 
---
Is Blizzard holding a gun to your head telling you not to play with other people? 
---
And that's neither complex or engaging.
---
Just make gray cloth boots with run speed enchant. To be used on EVERY alt you ever play later on. +30 spellpower, is that even in the game early on ? I wouldnt do other enchants than the boots, unless you are going to run multiple of same type of alts (like loads of L20 warlocks for summoning). Remember you can share the enchanted levelup stuff with your friends and guildies. 
---
Another idea is to either pay someone or get a friend to help you levelup via instances, aoe grind. L30-35 sits pretty nicely about at the range 1 person actually can boost you... and for this to work you need low level engineering. If you do the powerleveling your own consumables dont mean anything, since you just attack once and then wait for the L60 to kill em all. MAYBE some increased stamina could help that mistakes wont happen and you die.
---
Something everyone but rogues hated up til wotlk but youtuber bitched about so it's being added back in.
---
Tone down world buffs
---
Check his discord for his times. There's also a thread on Barrens.chat dedicated for speedrunning classic with a few people posting their results. 
---
People loved getting good loot in Vanilla because it happened way less often, and it actually felt like an upgrade. For years in retail loot has been thrown at you left, right and center and most of the time it's teeny tiny incremental upgrades.
---
You don't HAVE to wear the BiS gear, within reason, if you want to look badass. Casual raiding guilds aren't gonna give a shit if you wanna have a full T1 Warlock. 
---
What, do you think it's literally impossible to go more than 4D 20H? And that the only reason he was able to go 22H faster was because of private server black magic? Also, Please give some examples of "notoriously incorrect". 
---
I get what you're saying.  After all, 400ms is 400ms, although that's only at the very *most* coincidental of timings.  That alone is technically not impossible for a human to play around, but, just like you said, people would have to be incredibly predictable, virtually like bots, and I just don't see that happening.
---
Then again, perhaps I give people too much credit in PVP, lol.  And besides, things like Intercept do have a min range, so I guess a couple things would have telegraphs like that.  It still seems silly to me to deliberately implement this, but oh well.
---
Btw, about Vanish: Although it may rarely be involved in the spell batching issue, that's a different thing most of the time, not counting when it worked on Blind, I think.  It working on Blind or anything that instantaneous likely was spell batching, yeah.  I assume you just walk around blinded while in vanish when that happens?
---
Anyway, there's a funny kind of built-in immunity for Vanish where it just ignores things at a certain timing, almost only "missile" spells such as Fireball, not even showing an Immune message.  You can actually see it in the spell data: http://classicdb.ch/?spell=1857 "(79) Sanctuary"  On Wowhead, https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=1857/vanish it's called, "Abort All Pending Attacks" Don't mind the -1 value.  Classic Wowhead is stupidly bugged where every single number value in the data is -1 of what it's supposed to be.
---
They removed it at some point after Wrath, either in Cataclysm or Mists of Pandaria, I forget which, and slightly extended Cloak of Shadow's effect of full magic immunity from 1ms to, I'm assuming, 500 ms.  Of course, this doesn't work against anything physical like Vanish used to, so as a Rogue throughout TBC, Wrath, and Cataclysm, it kind of made me a little sad because I had just gotten used to using Vanish on the boss AoEs in Vault of Archavon and other raids several months before Cataclysm, which allowed me to save Cloak of Shadows for other things.
---
Check back at 2pm. 
---
My favorite is the post that "BLIZZARD PROMISED SPELL BATCHING!!!".  You always hear about all these broken "promises" when in fact they never promised anything.. typically they say something like "We're going to be putting spell batching into classic wow" and then later "Spell batching it turns out is not feasible for x, y, and z reason."  People, nowhere did they promise anything.  They said they would do something and then informed you that they wouldn't be able to.. that's life.
---
for me owl on the left looks bored while owl on the right looks intrigued/intrested
---
yeah but the owl on the right side look already bored too lol
---
You people are worse than crack addicts.  Chill homies.
---
Can’t use private servers like that. I’m pretty sure there’s some stupid shit like the bloodsail imps giving same xp as a normal mob. 
---
You do realize they said that it's coming in the summer right? 
---
Hunter can solo most dungeons, but it takes a long time for the higher level ones. Famously, Dysphoria did a video series in vanilla titled 'Hunter vs World' where they soloed the bosses in Dire Maul: East, Dire Maul: North, Lower Blackrock Spire, and Scholomance.
---
That's pretty funny. 
---
the c&amp;d was supposedly faked, considering that the server was up and running for a small group of his friends for months before he decided to quietly "reopen" the server
---
Just broke my brian.
---
Quantization is probably more accurate than lag. Hmm..
---
Certainly Hunter, I would also level clothing for the Mooncloth CD. If you're Horde follow Joana's Guide.
---
yeah reck spec but mind u /sit abuse wont work
---
there is also the 20/0/31 https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxuoxZZtf0trcq for 2h pvp
---
There were so many idiots saying spell batching doesn’t matter and telling everyone to stop worrying about it
---
To add to this, you underestimate how hard it is to get some of the BiS items....so when it’s raid time and your set pieces drop you get them, now that 1 item isn’t BiS because you have a 3/5/7 pc bonus, and now it’s only BiS if you get the other 4 BiS pieces...but there’s no point because you already have lots of tier so you might as well keep getting that.
---
Gear isn’t like retail where you map out what you want then go get it, you legit need option A,B,C,D of items because it’s much harder to get gear in vanilla.
---
You’ll see :)
---
&gt;So a few months pass and suddenly its "Gummy did nothing wrong" spamfest again? Are those guys serious in thinking that?
---
I mean, he delivered the server he promised, even tho only for half a year, it was the best experience of any pservers for both vanilla and tbc content, so what's wrong?
---
Sometimes when it be like it is, it just do, is you understanding?
---
Thanks mate! Quick question here: why do the /sit macro wont work? I see that everywhere but cant find an explanation!
---
I didn't provide examples because I didn't feel like wasting more time on your trolling, not because there aren't any.
---
I might oblige later if I have time.
---
&gt;The difference between all of those games and Classic is that the Classic team is actually listening to its playerbase and actually adds what the community wants. 
---
You're right.  They aren't listening to all the playerbase.. people are saying things like "Keep everything the same but fix the broken specs!".  They are doing is listening to feedback on how to best keep the game an authentic "vanilla" experience.  Then they are weighing that feedback against the information they have and making decisions from that.
---
Spell batching won't make anything feel laggy unless two spells that both you and opponent use on each other land in those 200ms batches. That doesn't really happen that often, and when it does it's typically not a big deal. I remember that at most I would anticipate the double-charge, double-poly scenarios and work it into my strategy. Or I would try to anticipate interrupting at the start of their cast, instead of reacting to their cast and trying to interrupt it at the end. 
---
Hey you, I know you. Small internet. Beefstew/Ralphtauren/Brando TS' friend/shitty hunter guildie. 
---
Exactly, some people seem to be under the impression that they'll all get BiS and chances are you'll have to settle for whatever you can get.
---
this
---
Yeah, probably better to tell yourself that.
---
Specifically the Diremaul ones I would love to see fad off in other instances...
---
Ah didn't get that far. My bad then. 
---
&gt;And what complex and engaging systems did Vanilla have to offer? Grind mobs in the open world or go to a dungeon to press 1, or in extreme cases, 2 buttons. That's of course assuming you picked one of the few viable specs, if not, tough shit.

Whataboutism (also known as whataboutery) is a variant of the tu quoque logical fallacy that attempts to discredit an opponent's position by charging them with hypocrisy without directly refuting or disproving their argument, which in the United States is particularly associated with Soviet and Russian propaganda.

**Whataboutism**
---
Whataboutism (also known as whataboutery) is a variant of the tu quoque logical fallacy that attempts to discredit an opponent's position by charging them with hypocrisy without directly refuting or disproving their argument, which in the United States is particularly associated with Soviet and Russian propaganda. When criticisms were leveled at the Soviet Union during the Cold War, the Soviet response would often be "What about..." followed by an event in the Western world.The term "whataboutery" has been used in Britain and Ireland since the period of the Troubles (conflict) in Northern Ireland. Lexicographers date the first appearance of the variant whataboutism to the 1990s or 1970s, while other historians state that during the Cold War, Western officials referred to the Soviet propaganda strategy by that term. The tactic saw a resurgence in post-Soviet Russia, relating to human rights violations committed by, and criticisms of, the Russian government.

It DOES discourage people from killing civilians. You even said so! People that are ranking, though a smaller group than non-rankers, are not killing civilians because there's a consequence.
---
Without it, *both* groups would be killing the civilians without consequence. 
---
&gt;If Blizzard really doesn't want people to kill quest NPCs then they should make them unkillable or something.
---
No, that wouldn't fit with the lore. What *does* fit with the lore is your military leaders frowning on you killing civilians.
---
10% for the faction rep and another 10% for PVP rank 3, it stacks. 
---
If you don't PVP at all then getting rank 3 probably isn't worth it for the slow mount, but might be for the epic.
---
So here's the big big issue. The Unarmored mounts were live in a time when the mount's themselves were 1000g and riding was only 100g. If you don't revert to that pricing change, then everyone and their mom will have the unarmored mounts and they won't mean shit. If you Do revert to that pricing system, then you have what Wall Street and the Feds like to call insider information. You know now, because it happened 14 years ago, that the prices are going to change, so you could effectively get your epic mount for 200g instead of 1100 with a lot less patience required than grinding your 1100g. Also, that's a whole lot of surplus gold floating around in the economy, something that is actively pushed against.
---
lmao, his guide is free and has been for a while
---
Bear in mind, whilst not diminishing the time entirely, there’s been a lot of discrepancies between exp awarded for quests. Most notably in Tanaris.
---
I’m also levelling on a p server and the mob spawn count and respawn timers definitely ‘feel’ a little off. 
---
You get only 2 discounts.
---
One for being honored with any particulary city (-10%).
---
The second for being PvP rank 3 (-10%).
---
The second however is considered to be a PvP reward and will only be available when the PvP system is enabled.
---
I’m gonna break from tradition here and point out that playing from 1-20 in the current game is free, and for worgen, pandaren, and goblins, it’s actually quite a neat little experience.
---
Also, I recommend asking your question on /r/wow as well just so you can get a different opinion.
---
With all that said, I do overall agree that classic is the better experience. But I don’t think modern WoW is all bad.
---
Frankly it's a waste of time. I wish he'd devote his time and focus on things more important.
---
Just buy (or craft but don't level tailoring just for bags) the best bags you can afford.
---
Maybe not a modern servers issue, and more of a some sort of bug that introduced (based on what I've read on the support forums, and my own experiences). They implemented sharding in a big way with the Legion launch event. Those shards held enough people for multiple raids to run around killing a bunch of demon NPCs that were spawning into Westfall and the Barrens, and I don't recall that much lag (beyond the usual FPS drops when everyone was fighting the final bosses). 
---
But yes spell batching will certainly make it easier for servers to track large numbers of people in the same area. 
---
Hunter, easily. You'll be 35 in less than 24 hours played if you do it right, I think.
---
Also hunters. And, I bet, a bunch of other classes with different micromechanics.
---
Honored: 10% discount
---
Exalted: You can buy mounts of the specific race.
---
Rank 3 PvP: 10% discount
---
Don't know if the discounts are stacking. 
---
I played at release, and the starting zones where chaos.
---
Hundreds of people gathered to kill 10 boars. 
---
Everybody racing like mad using their instant spells to get that tag before the onslaught of spells incinerated the boar.
---
That quest took me 30minutes to complete.
---
The farming runs for black lotus or thorium veins, people from both factions racing to the node and fighting over it, having the winner get the node...only to have it stolen by a passerby rogue sapping and stealing as the gathering was almost complete.
---
I loved all of it, and would hate to see sharding ruin it by making resources abundant and the world "emptier".
---
I only went to high pop servers, but wouldnt mind an increase in population even further...as long as sharding is not added!
---

This is pretty much it. I remember seeing a Rogue in Bloodfang and thinking, holy shit, that's awesome. But then if you see any character in AQ40 gear, then you know they're the real deal....although the AQ40 gear wasn't quite as cool looking as some of the tier 2 sets, it didn't matter.
---
Rogue as CC matters in Classic dungeons and they are great solo questers. They have a number of builds that can operate with pretty garbage gear for soloing and pvp as well.
---
I voted for Durotar! It feels like home, very snug and safe

When your battle ground queue pops, you are unqueued from other battle grounds.

One faction abandoning ship for AB if the other is 2-0 in WSG isn't healthy.
---
    Mulgore for sure! Love the rolling green hills, the tribal themes, the wildlife and certainly Thunderbluff towering off in the distance.  
---
    Some of my best memories are from defending Thunderbluff and Bloodhoof village from the filthy alliance. Encountering a druid in Mulgore was never fun for them, especially when I could lure them to the lake... 😆
---
All the people saying hunter don’t realise that the real high IQ play is Warlock. You can kill two. It’s in one stone by having it as a summoning alt for raids

lmao, deleted his post because people didn't agree with him. What a little bitch.

I miss the days when products would be released out into the wild without matketing hype and the cattle would just graze through all the shit. And the products that were gold would be talked about for years. 
---
Those two discounts stack.
---
its a 3 hour video come on man throw me a bone
---
Yeah, 200 players fighting won't come up much. But I dunno, that seems low apart from essentially dead servers. There were probably 3-4 guilds on my faction doing AQ40/Naxx content and tons more doing MC/BWL, and my server wasn't full or anything.
---
Hell, I've seen people talking about how easy it is to get Dal'Rends swords for a Rogue, or the sword off Ony....I ended up with Perdition's Blade in vanilla before getting any of those, so I ended up combat daggers rather than swords..
---
If they are messing around with things like Spell Batching and deciding which version of AV to use, a content feature which won't even be available in the first content phase -- I'd assume they are quite close to being "done" with the the project.
---
honestly if you had a epic bind on a equip item, personally I think the best thing to do is sell it. You'll get so much gold for that epic mount you'll never replace, unless you get a drop, but you'll replace that epic weapon. Just my opinion.
---
Agreed. The lag you had on pservers was much worse than the spell batching thing, as well. You legit couldn't play certain specs on pservers due to the lag. Not really sure what this guys talking about with pservers not having server lag.

&gt;My fiancee wants us to go on holiday abroad this summer just after July. I started buying random shit for her just to convince her to stay. So far it's working...for now.
---
&gt; I think there was also a comment that one of the original game designers actually wanted a SMALLER population cap to foster a greater sense of small community.
---
Yes I linked that clip in my original post.
---
nvm at about 27min 
---
Maybe i should rephrase it: I've leveled up a DPS warrior (combined with fury and arms) up to level 40 and always kept a tanking set with me, and tanked when needed. I'll totally tank dungeons and I don't mind  tanking adds at the end game. I know that you don't have to roll prot for dungeons, what about end game raids though? Is it enough to just have a tanking set without going prot?
---
Ive heard of this strategy
---
as a very long term investment
---
so u level up a bunch of 35s for alchemy
---
and just sell transmute services with their mats or maybe u find cheap ones in AH
---
you can also do it with LWs salt shaker
---
it probably takes months to make up the time lost when u could make money in normal ways
---
haha like a wow nerd could get a  girl

Can u message me the link? I'm really interested in this.

It doesn't need to "mean a lot". In fact it could've been a year because that's all you need to figure out that these things that non-software devs think are "small changes, just flip a switch lol!", usually aren't. It'd also not take any number of years to figure out that there isn't just one person going about his own personal project making a ton of decisions all on his own. It's a team effort, and then there are teams of teams... none of this shit happens in a two week vacuum.

What happens if your 20k tourists decide they like it and don't want to leave ? Frankly I wouldn't want to be in Blizzard shoes : they have a lot of ways to fuck this up and no real path to victory here.
---
Blizzard had a meeting with devs from a certain private server I think. I think the big thing they asked them about what was their server architecture. We dont know exactly what they "learned" but it was a 5 hour meeting.

---
I had a Orc warrior named Donkeyballs. They changed it to Donkeyb. It was so upsetting. Oh To be 14 again. 
---
Hmm yeah but almost every class is a glass canon when properly geared. Even the paladin will do a lot of hurt with the CT axe or even worse the KT mace. I just find PvP more interesting when the fights take longer than 2 seconds. 
---
I'm not talking about a sense of rewardment in general though. I'm referring SPECIFICALLY to the rewardment of receiving an item. We could have a completely different discussion about the former. 
---
In regards to the current topic, I'm merely suggesting there is no sense of rewardment for receiving an item, when oftentimes it isn't even an item to be used.
---
So yes, of course I'm going to raid because I want to finish it and feel the accompanying sense of accomplishment that comes along with it. However, that doesn't mean I won't feel a slight sense of disappointment when I end up putting a perceived upgrade into my bank because it actually isn't an upgrade. 
---
😂
---
I'll reply later mate, try to cheer up in the meantime!
---
I think the batch is somewhere in the 0.3 seconds window. Adding ping with 0.2 you could start to walk with half a second left on your mount summon and after a couple steps you would mount up lol.

Just make a bank alt and level it to 5 and give them enchanting so that you can send shit to them to DE.  That's what I always do.
---
Getting enchanting "mostly to DE" is a waste.

I’m going on a 2-week vacation on July 15th, so i bet my ass that it’s going to be released on July 16th.

As long as I get a month notice, I can request a day or two on top of my “normal” 3 days off so I can go all nerd. Plus I’ll need to upgrade my desktop since my laptop can only run the 1.12 client. Battle.net freezes for some reason....
---
You could try a private server they are really good. I would not though, log in to Classic blind it will be the best. 
---
&gt; I should for for Fury/arms with 2h for leveling (since there are not a lot of +hit items for dual wield before the endgame?)
---
You want to level as Arms with a 2h for sure, yes. It is not just because of the damage but also you can greatly reduce damage by kiting mobs with a 2h when solo leveling.
---
&gt; 60 go for dual wield and switch to Fury.As for DPS, i've been suggested to go Arms for MS and 2h ofc.
---
As a Fury raid DPS you want to wear a 2h when raiding for quite a long time especially as Horde since we have Windfury. When you get better gear and good 1h weapons you make the switch to dual wielding.
---
&gt; Also, what are my chances to join a casual raiding guild as a DPS warrior? Are there any slots for those or they're all Tankers?
---
A typical guild setup for Warriors: 3-4 tanks, most of them will be Prot Warriors. Maybe you'll have 1 Feral Druid off-tank. Then the rest of the Warriors are Fury DPS, 4-8 depending on the guild. There is *alot* of space for Warriors in general.
---
Also if you roll Warrior you'll have to aquire tank gear and be ready to tank, regardless if you are mostly a DPS or not. At some point you'll want to be tanking something. There are raid encounters that require a lot of tanks even in early raids. Or your tanks simply don't show up for the raid and you will have to be ready to do it. Or even if its just 5mans which will be your main source of income (consumables, respeccing costs etc.) as a Warrior. You'll be tanking with defensive gear but you won't need to respec for it.
---
Yes, but by now, they could maybe make the time frame a bit smaller.

---
Not surprised to see such cockiness displayed over such a well-known topic. Your stance is literally Blizzard's "We don't need High Elves because they don't exist anymore, but we keep adding High Elf NPC's into the game, and here's Void Elves a population of 30!" routine. 
---
Even in lore it's recognized that High Elves are substantially different, they draw on different magics (which was the primary reason Night Elves and High Elves are different) and when the Sunwell is restored, Blood Elves' eyes change, but they do not go back to their pale hue or taller stature. 
---
There is a definitive racial difference, you'd have to be blind not to see. 
---
I wouldn’t lost hope until end of April. 
---
Even did it without using potions and other consumables, so if u bring pots its VERY doable at 30 except for the Thundering exiles and Cyclonean

Bank alts can't disenchant bind on pickup though, which is what you mostly want to disenchant.  A lot of boe stuff you can put on auction house anyway.
---
Feralas, Felwood. Not a fan of tree's.
---
I think removing is unnecessary, they do give you a nice kick when you're a lowbie in a city where a top dog guild turned in a head and even if you're max level it does help solo farming, especially if you're a broke healer.
---
I think simply disabling the buffs in the instanced zones would be the best option.
---
But that's the thing man...rogues are one of the few classes that actually use their full T2 set. 
---
Spell Batching is most important to PvPers, and after everything Blizzard has done with PvP systems and class design in WoD, Legion, and BFA, they do NOT deserve the benefit of the doubt from PvPers at this time.
---
But what about the sense of rewardment for crafting your BiS despite what raid content is out? IMO id feel very accomplished knowing I already have 1 of my BiS, but this is a very limited scenario. There will a lot more times where you actually upgrade your gear by doing later raids

If you are just looking for an MMORPG here are several:
---
Current WoW (high population...)
---
      
---
Tera Online (Good combat)
---
Black Desert Online (Good graphics)
---
     
---
Elder Scrolls Online (Good mix of everything dept maybe combat)
---
Personally I would wait for classic WoW then one of these will happen:
---
This game rocks it's like a while new world (so keep playing classic)
---
These graphics suck ass but I like that there are lots of buttons to press for Hunter! (Play Tera Online. More realistic style graphics and a bit more "action" combat but still with two rows of souls like WoW.)
---
These graphics suck ass and I don't like that there's so many skills to learn! I do like the gear system tho and prefer western fantasy themes. (Play Elder Scrolls Online.)
---
These graphics suck ass and I need the best graphics! (Black Desert Online.... It's very friendly tho? More than Classic I think?)
---
I want slightly better graphics that are a mix of fantasy and realistic but still western themed. Also to be able to play with controller easily if I wish it still have lots of skills (play Final Fantasy)
---
Basically the way the MMORPG market works is every game has one thing that's pretty different than the ready. Sometimes it's how they handle class's and skills, sometimes it's the art theme, other times it's difficulty in terms of buttons to press or the actual combat system.
---
Personally I think all the games I mentioned either have several great qualities or do something very well. 
---
Imo WoW was already dated gaphis wise within it's first few years but the gameplay was better than most of it's competition. What made it better wasn't the responsiveness or the controls. It was dozens upon dozens of really small things that they've since changed or removed from retail.
---
Think of it like this: For an amazing book every sentence, every line, is tailor made with live and affection. Writing a paragraph sloppily because you don't care about exposition is awful. It's jarring for the reader. Original WoW had some of this of course, but they really went above and beyond what other games are doing at the time or do to this day.
---
For instance in original WoW there was more stuff that only certain classes could do. That's like being able to have the reader understand the personalities of multiple characters Inna single book. Most **books** don't even do that now days.
---
I'm rolling warlock.  I plan to do Skinning/herb during leveling and then drop skinning for Tailoring and boost it up.  I'm going to keep herb for money making at 60 and tailoring because alot of the BIS stuff is made by tailoring, plus Bloodvine has a nice 3 piece set if you're max tailor.
---
Why not the other way: They provide a dl link and be like classic is out now have fun. And it directs to a rickroll or something.
---
Ah yes, the BfA exclusive boosting. Definately no leveling, profession, or fully geared characters for sale in Vanilla.
---
And you are the devil incarnate.
---
Looking forward for WoW Demon Souls Edition xD
---
I agree with this - assuming you and everyone in your group has shit gear, endgame dungeons will be technically possible, but very painful with a Spriest healing an Arms warrior tank. 
---
Isn't it the opposite though?  People wanted the conveniences of modern wow.  People complained on forums about all the little things that could be improved and make the game better and smoother.  People wanted battle groups, they wanted flying mounts, they wanted professions restarting each expansion, they wanted group finder and looking for raid, they wanted cross server grouping, they wanted sharding, ect..  
---
In this subreddit even I still read posts about how people want "no changes" except... Except, fix the broken specs, make mc harder, change talent trees, ect.. you see it here even among the people most adamant about wanting an authentic experience.  
---
What they are doing is agreeing with what you are saying and thinking for once.  They have a team of people working towards the same ends that you imagine now, so it feels like they are listening for once.  They have been taking feedback the whole time and the game has been changing to support the more populous casual caste of players.
---
Can't compute
---
Yeah, I'm the salty one. Not the guy complaining that all the stuff that the community said they wanted implement actually getting implemented. 
---
It was just a currency you "earned" by showing up to guild events and spent on loot.. some guilds would take points away when you weren't active or if you constantly screwed up. 
---
Building a good raid set (or really multiple raid sets for different situations) is non-linear in vanilla. You sometimes need one key item to hold together a special set. You can sometimes wait weeks, months, or years (bindings!) for your true BiS set to come together. In the meantime there are countless decisions and tradeoffs to make the best of what you have. Now if you extend this same idea across each class in your raid, and then to the entire raid, and you’re involved in allocating gear for your raid through loot council or whatever loot system you use, you can start to see the collaborative gear and resource management aspect of the game that some people really enjoyed. 
---
It doesn't really matter, the second they get AQ40 gear, it gets replaced with a less good looking set, but in Vanilla, it didn't really matter, you still knew it was badass, regardless of how it looked.
---
That same concept applies for all the other classes. Either way, I played classic for a good 3 years, and only had like 1 piece tier 1, two pieces tier 2, some AQ20 gear, some ZG gear...so you're going to look like a clown regardless.
---
On a priest?? :(

Year 2038 problem : [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year\_2038\_problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem)
---
&gt;Lastly, as a shaman you will (most likely) be put in the tank/melee group and the only one benefiting from mana tide will be you.
---
You can just rotate the shamans in healer group, giving them 4 mana tides. As well that you might need to rotate the shaman in the tank group because you got tremor totem AND tank berserker rage on CD. Seem to remember on example nefarious fight that the fear cd was so tight that it had to be done (or maybe it was needed after a missclick).
---
**Year 2038 problem**
---
The Year 2038 problem relates to representing time in many digital systems as the number of seconds passed since 1 January 1970 and storing it as a signed 32-bit binary integer. Such implementations cannot encode times after 03:14:07 UTC on 19 January 2038. Just like the Y2K problem, the Year 2038 problem is caused by insufficient capacity of the chosen storage unit.
---
In retail there's a bunch of "stats" about your char you can see, like number of times you died and money spent on FP. Would be cool to have something similar as an addon in classic.
---
yeah and mining takes forever, plus fail fail fail annoying, plus some other dude runs up and starts mining the same node stealing ore from you...fuck mining

I can still remember farming the Wintersaber Trainers rep to get an Unarmored Epic saber mount.

Never got the original Epic Mounts.

I got you an appropriate flair bruv.

Barbershop with only the original hairstyles available would be nice, but I can live without it.

I know I know.

No

All these plebeian votes for elwyn forest.
---
Be a man of class and vote for Mulgore or Tirisfal.
---
I think it might just be a change in the culture. We know more about what is going on these days. Back in 2004, the hype we got was from TV commercials. Now, we are in direct contact with developers, which honestly sucks from the developer standpoint... Oh well, times change. You have to roll with the changes.
---
Good analysis. A good Warrior will have to feel out how much kiting is beneficial.
---
There is also the mere fact that you don't have infinite space around you. Yes, kiting is usually the most efficient way to kill mobs but not when you body pull more.
---
Sidenote: Hamstring kiting isn't something new people discovered on pservers. I remember vividly how my brother kited on his first Warrior in retail vanilla. It was his second character he leveled to 60 so he already had more knowledge of how to approach the game. It was common knowledge that kiting in general is beneficial for any class, esepecially amongst people who did alot of PvP and raided into content that required better movement.
---
I tought about this ide aswell. But how many times should servers merge? Get to know everyone for 3 months and suddently the population get dubbelled. 
---
Being the Nr.1 Guild on the realm and suddendly your guild is Nr.4 .
---
Its one of the better idea's but I'm still not sure if its the best option. 
---
Damn internet, ruining everything. 
---
More like 'I walked the extra mile. Envy me!'
---
The Brood reputation thing was not the bottleneck of the process at all.
---
Private servers is the best place to practise lvling routes for Classic. Whoever says the opposite is delusional or has pretty low IQ tbh. Even if there is a difference at the xp ( there is not ) its still the best way to prepare for classic if you wanna level faster than most of people.
---
His guide is free available on his website.
---
He'll make an ingame guide, that, you'll have to pay for.
---
I have nothing against paying for content. I'll try his guide. If I like it and use it, I'll support him for sure. 
---
Classic wow
---
It was a hard time for me, but you're welcome guys. 
---
I thought it was a weird point too to say "90% isn't enough" because in the context of 1.12 it certainly is. 
---
Cat doesn't do anywhere near 90% of the dps of a rogue at a similar progression level. If they did, I would say they'd be raid viable for most groups. 
---
I don't think they give exactly the same, but definitely in the neighborhood. Certainly worth it for only a few swings. I abused them for a few quick grinded levels.
---
I want the toxicity though.
---
Your attendence/activity was rewarded with points.
---
These points could be used to bid for items. (Some had open bid, others closed bid).
---
The old dkp system has been replaced with the new EPGP(effort points/gear points).
---
EP’s gathered similar way to how you would in Dkp, However it’s not so much of a bidding-war, your ratio determines the likelyhood of you winning an item.
---
A more detailed ruleset of How to obtain EP’s and loot distributing will most likely be in place for each guild. Endless possibilities and different variations.
---
The other popular system is Loot-Council. A core of X amount determines who’ll receive an item, based on How much value the guild will gain.
---
I don’t have a lot of positive experiences with loot-council, as it’s so hard not to be biased, and you have very little data available to account for your decisions. (The player with highest item lvl upgrade?)
---
I think people are posing unreal standards for a 2004 game. We had 15 years of free time to discuss and min/max stuff.
---
In 2004-2006:
---
Most people didnt overkill stuff, they were happy to see their class tiers drops and equipped them. Being in full t1 or t2 was highly valued in 2004-2006 and this fact cannot be changed by some 2019 guide which urges you to equip pink robes instead of your class armor for +20 healing.
---
In 2019:
---
People can argue that the itemziation is bad in Classic and it is good in Retail. Again, if you enjoy comparing a 2004 and a 2019 game in one single aspect, then sure do it. Over-idealizing and saying 'itemization in vanilla is perfect' is plain wrong as well because the facts do not support this.
---
However, the point is, people want to play vanilla WoW without  changes. People (ideally) should not care whether the itemization is 'good' or 'bad' in vanilla by 2019 standards. If you dont like it, dont play it simple as that.
---
As a side note, 'bad' itemization creates diversity in the game. Hybrids will wait for the opening of AQ40 more than others. Some items are so game changing that they will refresh the dps meta (e.g. bloodvine). Some tiers sets are excellent for PvP (e.g. warlock tier1) which will be mainly taken by PvP oriented raiders. Legendaries are not ideal for everyone but each guild will distribute them differently. Blue and purple PvP items are good for some classes and not so good for other classes.
---
Everyone can look forward to different gear pieces to achieve different goals during different content phases. 
---
Sorry I am referring to outside the "major" ones.  Most people list A TON of necessary consumables.  Outside flask of power, 1 arcane? type potion, mongoose, and uh were sharpening stones a vanilla thing?  It has been a really long time I guess I don't remember how many gave anywhere near as much of a benefit as the primary few.
---
Fuck that guy
---
April Fools day? I am not ready yet
---
ok dude...waste a profession to DE some BOP items you don't need now and then.
---
Enchanting is a complete waste for a main character unless you have the in to be a guilds enchanter and are given all of the rare drop recipes to use....or you are just a casual that doesn't care...in that case go ahead.
---
No,  it's a legit download link to what looks to be classic but its actually an instanced version of Warlords of Dreanor 
---
TitanPanel have a ton of plug-ins. Same with CT_mod.
---
I know there’s one that shows How much gold you’ve spent on repair, flights etc
---
Absolutely. It’s a fantastic zone. Easily my favourite on the horde side. 
---
That 2v1 action in Menethil Harbor is next level. Awesome video.
---
Didn’t you play with a Spriest named Zzi? Do you know if he’s coming back for classic?
---
Why am I assuming he won't do M+? Because he has no reason to.
---
There is no nothing special to be had in M+ that you can't get from just doing world quest and heroic dungeons. What, you think a new player that has played til level 120 basically playing a single player game is all of a sudden going to try to find a M+ group because he wants one mount out of the hundreds that exist?
---
In Retail today there is no reason to socialise until you hit the wall that is Normal/Heroic raiding and M+. And as you aren't familiar with how to go about finding a group or finding a guild before you hit max, the odds of you actually going out of you way to do that because you want 40 more item level is very slim. 
---
Do you really think a new player will go out of their way for some flimsy ilvl numbers? Most people don't care, they want to look cool and transmog can do that for you. I don't think Ive ever been wow'd by an item level because truth is most people just really don't care. You get basically the full game from LFR and LFD, why push higher tier content when you've already done it once? 
---
Also this is a CLASSIC sub. People here are here because we don't like Retail. If we did we'd play it and not wait for years for the original version. If you love the game so much go play it. Don't know why you're shocked people here aren't fans of the new Wow's systems.
---
Sorry but you cannot do last boss in Uldaman if only two players are present since you need three to even be able to summon him.

I think owls always look disinterested and bored/annoyed.

Whoa that UI is epically bad

They gonna announce pandaren as playable race in classic on April 1st. Calling it now.
---
Damn, my bad, mixed those up in my head.
---
Fact Check...
---
...
---
Yup. It was horribly unfinished. They are STILL trying to finish it.
---
It's called vanilla flashback, as in a flashback to vanilla pvp. It's not meant to be interpreted as 14 year old footage.
---
If you have never seen Office Space yet, please do yourself a favor and watch it.
---
DKP has many systems and variations between guilds. It is my opinion that any DKP system should not be used if you’re trying to run a “world first” type progression guild, and the people determining who gets what gear and when know just wtf they are doing. 
---
When I was running my guild in TBC we were serious about raiding, but not competitive, so we adopted a DKP system. We still had all sorts of drama until we went to a Blind Bid DKP system. Zero drama, and people were actually happy for those that won the bid. It won’t work for every guild, so as long as you know your players you will know what works best for your raid team. DKP isn’t always the best option, so keep that in mind.
---
It gets a lot of hate here, but man stonetalon is BEAUTIFUL. One of my favourite zones as horde back in the day.
---
Mulgore all the way
---
Pservers were using the wrong quest xp rewards until recently. You definitely should not trust their values to be completely accurate.
---
That being said, even if they’re wrong they’re still the best we have access to for now
---
Gear IMO. Makes farming gold easier unless you’re farming nodes for gold and gives you priority in groups.
---
You can totally select.... 4 units at once. Ya WC1 takes a lot of patience to play, but I loved it as a kid. 
---
We might.
---
Its part of 1.12 "warts and all" and I honestly think it was a net benefit, even if Reddit cries and cries about how they don't see the same and only 19 other people every BG.
---
In my humble opinion, [Being able to play the game] &gt; [Waiting 3 hours to see the same people every time].
---
As of right now, we don't know.
---
Ive only ever played balance/resto I can't stand feral for some reason, but balance pvp is fucking awesome. all I did on him was pvp/raid but I used my mage to gear level and fund him 
---
Im annoyed by the "just play what you want" reply's if people want to know what works best. 
---
Those that will play what they want will not ask what is best. Because they dont care about that.
---
Great question. It's because it looks weird if I name my Tauren Warrior ''Toetickler''.
---
People don't make death threats over everything. Take that back or I'll make you wish you did! 
---
For PvP, the more warriors the better IMO because as casters we need as many free HKs as possible. Sorta tongue-in-cheek but the truth is most warriors are bad tanks and bad at PvP. For example, they charge into a pack of enemies and die after getting 1 swing or zero when the mage snares them. The good warriors sit back and wait for enemies to get out of position showing patience and then dropping the hammer. In PvE they wait for healers to have mana, mark targets, and don’t overpull.
---
Point is:  if you plan on being good at warrior, you don’t have much to worry about. Play the class you love and care about being good at.
---
And I honestly don't remember being able to drag select before (maybe I was ignorant back then), I used to shift + click each unit. Not that mattered much, you could only control 4 units at once. 
---
I think the biggest twist would be actually releasing it on 4/1. Everyone would be waiting for the kicker
---
It's an owl
---
Of course retail has more complicated rotations. It's not actually hard. But relative to other DPS specs in Vanilla raiding, Fury requires significantly more attention. Rage is an unpredictable resource, there's actually important cooldowns to manage, and Overpower is a precursor to all the random procs they later added for every class rotation. Plus they have to worry about threat more than any other class.
---
Of course it's a scam, if you're curious or stupid enough to get caught the joke is on you. But why they would ban a scammer and not a griefer is beyond me. You can corpse camp someone for 2 hours, but somehow it's OK but don't you dare steal 2G from him by ruse !
---
Are we talking current PVP o=rank or, "has achieved" PVP rank?
---
Thanks! 
---
The basic system was pretty universal: show up, kill stuff, get dkp. Some guilds had additional rules or other systems.
---
My guild used two separate systems, attendance points and DKP.
---
**DKP:**
---
For every boss you're there for (in raid or in reserve) you get 5 points.
---
For every full night you stay for (in raid or in reserve) you get 5 points.
---
If you don't show up without making an effort to at least tell *someone* you get docked 10 points. We had a lax attendance policy, but we had a three strike system for this. First time you lose 10 points, 2nd time 20, 3rd we just kick you.
---
I was hunter officer and I got away with implementing a hunter rule that unfortunately no other officers picked up for their own classes. If you show up to raid with no arrows, you lose 5 dkp. You can then buy arrows from me for another 5 dkp, or get kicked from the raid and try again next time. Eventually every hunter showed up prepared. Wish the other people in the raid did as well. So many people with no consumables.
---
You get an extra 10 bonus DKP for farming once a week. Send in some consumables, black lotus, thorium, whatever. If we use it, you can contribute and get credit. This system got heavily abused and I hated it. GM would give bonus DKP to people that didn't farm or that he was sleeping with.
---
Costs of items varied. Tier pieces cost X, necks cost X, trinkets X, weapons X, etc. I don't remember the exact cost.
---
**Attendance points:**
---
For every raid you are logged in for, you get 5 attendance points. Doesn't matter if you stay for the whole raid or get used. Attendance points were used exclusively for 'extra' drops like mounts. Unfortunately, because we were all stupid (our GM for implementing this, and us for not raising hell over it) back then, we also classified ony/nef/ossi/cthun body parts as 'extra' drops, despite the fact that they gave gear.
---
2 days in and everyone is still warily leveling waiting for the shutdown announcement in chat...
---
What I always do is macro the stance together with an ability that's only used in that stance - so if you're already in Battle, it'll use Overpower, if you're not in Battle, it'll switch to that stance. 
---
I wonder what Blizzard would say about hosting a raffle this way, with each person paying a small percentage of the value of the epic, with a real payoff (actual epic exchange).
---
Check my post, I have one for dwarf priest
---
Warlock
---
Correct me if im wrong, but arent shamans typically put in melee groups for windfury totem? 
---
This would make mana tide totem mostly for yourself. Its still good sure, but skipping it wont hurt anybody but yourself.
---
&gt;You could for example do PvP in your raiding spec. Why don't you do that instead? Deep resto
---
because he doesn't want to heal, he wants to blow shit up in PVP and get carried through raids to get free gears...duh!
---
There are dozens of systems from original WoW that have been gutted or changed. 
---
Major changes: 
---
- Talent system (Google "classic WoW talents")
---
- Stat system (Google "classic WoW stats and attributes" and compare to "WoW stats and attributes")
---
- Weapon Skill (it doesn't exist in retail)
---
- Race specific abilities were more meaningful/important in Classic WoW
---
- Classes were more race restricted 
---
- Paladins were Alliance only, Shan's were Horde only
---
- Classes weren't as "balanced" in terms of "every DPS is supposed to be within +/- X% of Y oint of DPS." 
---
Now on the one hand you're right that Retail/modern/current WoW has more zones, more levels, and more quests. 
---
On the other hand just imagine if they decided "you k owe what stats are complicated we're removing them entirely"
---
Cuz that's what they've done **every fucking expansion** since Cataclysm, the third expansion.
---
To put it another way imagine you go to the store and buy a book. It's so good you go to buy the 2nd. The store owner says "sure I can help you find that may I see your book?"
---
Then they take your book and go look for the 2md booking the series. You get your first book back, buy the 2nd, and head home proud and happy. 
---
Then when younger home you find out that they decided to rip pages out of the first book that you already paid for prior to even going in the shop that day. Just pages missing from every chapter. You'd be fixing pissed right?
---
That's my problem with modem WoW. 
---
If you don't mind your game changing in fundamental ways then it's a lot of fun. But frankly if Inbiy a Honda I want a fucking Honda not a Jeep, even though I love both cars.
---
   
---
Blizzard ALWAYS cared about account sharing. If you where in a guild where the officers demanded access to your account then you where a sucker.
---
To the OP. Officers would have a couple bank alts that they used as guild bank. They would need to flip to that toon to pull out items for people. It was not a great solution but we got by.
---
Lmao, why are you here if you hate Classic this much. You know what engaging systems they had? Slow progressing where you build a character level by level by making decisions where to put your talent points. Every few levels you go to a trainer to learn new spells/ranks. You dont magically get these new abilities, you earn them. You pick up every trash item you find and fill up your limited bag space while questing because you know that you want your mount at 40 so you need to make that money, but you also need to spend money on new abilities. There is no sharding. There are limited zones you can be in to quest in, if that Alliance crew is ganking you, well you have to deal with it somehow. Maybe you form a party with other Horde players to wipe them so you can quest there? Oh, you're struggling to level and you really want that blue item from a dungeon? Well YOU need to find a group. Which could prove difficult as you've decided to be an asshole to other members of your faction and now no one wants to group with you. Do I need to go on? What's engaging about Classic you ask? The RPG elements. Your actions have consquences. You will run into issues and it's up to you how you solve them. When was the last time you had trouble doing ANYTHING in Retail? When is the last time YOU had to solve anything? All you do in retail is click "queue up" and you get put in an instance. Sharding makes never see the same person ever again. There is no world left in World of Warcraft. Just an instanced solo mobilegame  with Multiplayer elements where everything is a button click away...
---
Pservers are wrong in a lot of ways when it comes to leveling speed. Inaccurate quest xp, minions giving about 500% if they xp they awarded in vanilla, and dynamic respawn all make it faster.
---
Pservers are closer to vanilla than retail, but they are miles away from being perfect recreation s
---
I remember \*slowly\* inching my units, 4 at a time, through all the dungeon levels because I didn't want a few of them to get caught by a fire elemental without the rest of the ranged units contributing damage. It was insanely slow, but for some reason I didn't mind it back then. 
---
Was that before they swapped prices of training vs. mounts?
---
They have the option for you to play on a PvE server. Corpse camping is 100% part of a PvP server
---
I'm already being told that a vacation in summer is probably out of the picture, because every co-worker set a date :/
---
Another way to look at it:  There will already be regular RP servers requiring those same changes and/or moderation.  This is just adding one or two more RP servers but flipping the pvp switch on.
---
I agree - it is VERY difficult to pick just one. I love Teldrassil, Mulgore, and Tirisfal.  
---
* Disable instance goldfarming (DM:W, tribute)
---
* XP gaining on/off
---
* Buff items from crafting professions in the 1-280 skillrange, make set-items actual sets worth collecting
---
* Make raid debuff limit class specific, eg. 5 debuffs per class, so that class-variation becomes beneficial, and hybrid DPS/TANK classes can utilize their full skill arsenal and be abit more competetive
---
* Change protection paladin talents that triggers on *chance-on-crit* with *chance-on-hit*   
---
(triggers on crit, while trying to be crit-immune tank? blizurd pls.)
---
When I raided we used a few different systems of DKP.  It’s really up to the group how they want to do it.  One system I really liked was a bidding system.  People got credit for bosses and attendance and then “bid” dkp on each item.  Some classes (tanks, main FPS, healers) got priority and could bid first, off spec usually had a higher bidding requirement.  Another guild I ran with used something hey called a GDKP system where they just sold everything with gold!  If you were poorly geared but had a lot of money the guild would run you through and you could just bid on what you wanted!  Items are bid using in game currency and the gold was split at the end of the raid.  Anything that didn’t sell for enough was shared or BoE’s were sold on the market and split amongst the raid. If I didn’t get anything I usually walked away with about 500 gold for a full MC clear!  Mind you we had it on farm and our goal was to make money to pay for mats for harder raids at the time.  Both systems were fine, but I found the GDKP system more helpful and fulfilling.  I would at least come out of a raid with money if I didn’t win anything 😊
---
Bunch of savages in this town.
---
I *think* it's current rank, but you'd have to fact check that. 
---
Good on Blizzard. Can’t wait to resub. Finish it up boys let’s get this party started!!!
---
&gt;Still, that one didn't take players directly into the dungeon, nor was it cross-server. So it didn't really impact community much. But you're right, it did exist.
---
Yeah, I quit in TBC (and came back briefly for cata/mop/wod/legion/bfa) and I don't really remember LFG working like it does now
---
PvP gear wasn't the best gear though, you couldn't raid efficiently and top meters in arena gear. On the flip side, a lot of DPS classes in the arena still mixed and matched PvE and PvP gear.  There was still an advantage to be had from PvEing.  Why should someone have to sit through hours of content that they feel so-so for just to be able to successfully play the content that they really want?
---
It's hard to cater to both sides here and I think that's where balancing started to homogenize...but they'd be alienating a large part of their player base if everything revolved around PvE.  
---
Yeah, the ***''Tight Pope''*** server gave you about **4-5 months** time before they retired the unarmored epic mounts, iirc.
---
Would be nice if Blizz does the same.
---
We were so hype for WoW in 2004. Hell, I was hype for War3 in like 2001 or 2002 or whenever, and Diablo 2 in 2000, that was probably the peak hype of my life at about 12 years old. When my mom picked me up from summer camp and she had the discs in the car, I tore into the manual on the ride back home. The hype level was off the charts.
---
We still knew about this stuff through the internet (IGN was around back then iirc) and also magazines like PC Gamer.
---
Omg, even with gear allowed, I don't think it could be done.  That would truly be legendary.
---
No can defense
---
Surprised Durotar is last. I really liked the Southwest feel with the red dirt. Voted Tirisfal though. Would have voted Tirisfal, DM, Durotat
---
This seems right along with what i want.
---
It's second now
---
Yeah, it is so damn slow and clunky. Every unit moves at about 1/3 the pace of WC3. Back in the day it was fun, I was easier to entertain, but it has not aged well.
---
As far as pvp gear for shadow priest, rank 10 and rank 13 is where it's at if you have the time to rank (as horde you will be very much in demand for premades as disc priest, and you can also heal raids with the same spec casters will love you).
---
Anathema should be easy to get and BWL has some nice pieces for shadow (gloves from Ebonroc, belt from Firemaw, ring from trash, dagger from Chromaggus/mace from Nefarian). Combine these pieces with rank 10 gear and faces will be melted.
---
AQ40 is very nice as well (gloves from trash, ring from rep, tier  2.5).
---
If you don't have PvP epic set make sure you get the robe from Naxx trash late game (400 armor on a cloth chest).
---
You should know that if you want the shadow spot in a raid group to get the +Damage PvE gear your guild will probably want you to have an optimal PvE spec which will make you less effective in PvP (wasting talent points in threat reduction talents for instance).
---
Hope it helps!
---
Disagree completely. Classic WoW is already changing a lot by basing it on 1.12, like flight point clicking, raid resets, talents, etc (meaning no changes fundamentalists are getting screwed either way).
---
&gt;5000 player vanilla private servers have been the most enjoyable form of WoW for a lot of us, and whilst I think a server with 10 000 people is overboard, I think something in the range of 2500 is not nearly enough. 
---
Technology has improved, and many things have changed throughout WoW, there's no reason why we should stick to an arbitrary player cap from 14 years ago just because "it would be more authentic", especially considering the fact that we know servers with twice or thrice that are much better gameplay wise.
---
damn son i woulda been watering at the mouth for that pc (at the time ofc)
---
Well, for leveling and maybe for DPS, but imagine if staves were used in a more extended fashion. They could add to parry chance, maybe some armor, and then have some talents that lend to using staves.
---
Kinda like how they make DKs tank with 2handed weapons.
---
\+ fucking amazin!
---
People play on RP servers that dont RP.
---
People play on RP-PvP servers and dont RP.
---
People RP on normal PvE servers.
---
People RP on PvP servers.
---
Has always been the case. Still no reason to give "true" PvP-RP'ers no home.
---
I haven't seen it. It doesn't play on pc and I have no phone.
---
I believe the unarmored epic mounts were actually **Bind on Equip** before the patch that adds the cloth turn-ins. Because of that, you could save up the gold, transfer it to a Troll character you own, buy the mount on that character and send it to your main. Or give the gold to a Troll buddy you trust so he can buy the mount for you. 
---
I know hunters end up bad and there’s a lot of crap like dead zone and no trap in combat...but I must try to get that epic bow quest from MC this time!
---
Elwynn Forest and Tirisfal Glades are both cool I'll give you that, but I'm surprised Teldrassil isn't higher on the list. It's so magical and mystical. I love the atmosphere of the entire place and the music there really complements the visuals. Love it!
---
Literally the dumbest possible thing to get excited about.
---
I laughed entirely too hard at this.
---
He was in full trolling mode. The RL equivalent of what he was typing would be chatting up people walking down the street with comments like "You tied your shoes today, doing great!" False praise for easy content is insincere at best and mean at worst. 
---
Yesterday I had a REAL interaction with a 'random' dungeon group (Mythic+10), and it was obvious several of the group members had not done the dungeon at that level of difficulty, including the tank. Instead of abandoning them, I took the time to walk them through how to correctly do the bosses. They were friendly, appreciative and even sent friend requests. THAT is real community, not some pseudo-RP bullshit from a 'personality' 
---
If you can bring a friend you can do it efficiently in your early 30's. And yes, your WW weapon will last you for a long time deep into your 50's even. In your early 30's it is basically OP and it is still a good weapon for your 50's but that is when you want to start looking for a replacement.
---
Here are some easy quest reward WW weapon replacements after you hit higher levels. Just by comparing to 50+ green weapons you can see how good WW weapons are:

As someone who is planning to Tank but also offspec dps (basically I want to mainly tank but also be able to flex to dps if irl happens) and HEAVILY enjoys PVP. What race? Part of me wants to min max and go gnome for escape artist but at the same time human wep skill is really good. Basically, I want to do it all in classic and I'm unsure what race overall would help me out. I'm pretty confused as to what race to play (I know a lot will say aesthetics which is a small part as well). 
---
To each their own. It took me a lot of time to get that raptor (there aren't a whole lot of darkspear quests), and I felt a sense of accomplishment when I finally got it.  
---
I did get some comments about it, but on the whole standing in orgrimmar with full T2 and Rhok'delar or Ashjrethul yielded a lot more geek cred.
---
Blizzard tend to announce release dates during events (such as Gamescom, PAX etc) as its PAX this weekend we might see them announcing the release date but I think they will release the date for Warcraft III Reforged first
---
&gt; rectangle-select units
---
hold control and drag/drop
---
It's a toss up between human / dwarf for me. I like dwarf's look and the just overall dwarf looks and animations but their racials other than treasure hunter suck :D.
---
I'll be going human just for the sword spec racial in classic. 
---
Apex Legends did that
---
This is absolutely gold. I got to say it struck a nerve with me as well. When I go and play retail I also get lost in all the things that are different. + that moment from one of the best movies ever made, gets me every time. Me being a complete emotionless asshole in day to day life. Still Crying.
---
As both a pvper and raider, I genuinely didn't care one way or the other.  It's just not one of those things that was even on my radar to care about, and that is partly because of exactly what you said:  An assumption that blizz wouldnt' do it because it wouldn't be worth the effort or even wouldn't be possible on the modern architecture.
---
If theyre only available for the first few months will it relaly be 'everyone' (and their moms) that has them?  More serious players will, sure...but people that are taking it slower probably wont.
---
I'd say they'd definitely have to establish the pricing they want from the start, and stick with it, otherwise someone will just train riding before that patch, and buy the mount after (like you said).
---
Let her ass go, more time for WoW when shes gone. Let some sweaty Moroccan bang her out for you too, more game time less cuddling. Its a win win.
---
I've replied to tons of these comments over the last few months: https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b5axxj/how_hardcore_must_a_guild_be_to_clear_naxx/ejc6yie/
---
and i mean some youtuber even did a video of it spouting the same stuff https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMEweKgWHro
---
I honestly don't believe you without seeing someone actually do it. You're gonna miss almost every attack on those elementals when they're 8-9 lvls above you.
---
Nah I mixed it up with 1k needles, that one I completely missed. Stonetalon I barely managed to get in at 26ish and did a few green quests. Only reason I went there though is because my guild called in for PvP and we had a glorious fight there. I would've skipped it without that, even if it is pretty.
---
There are just too many zones at 20-30. You are wrapping up darkshore and westfall, doing last part of DM, Stockades questchain, BFD AND questing in Ashenvale and Wetlands, 2 gigantic zones and NOW you should go to stonetalon as well?
---
But one thing I love about that zone is the faction-related lowbie NPCs. Horde gets quests to kill sons of cenarius and as alliance druid I felt compelled to PvP and defend my kin.
---
The Jonesing is unreal. I logged in to retail for the free weekend hoping to cop a fix but even the conventional leveling experience sucks. I groaned when I came to the shitty post-Cata Westfall. I wept openly as I killed NPCs four levels above me with neither of my bars moving. I pulled my own face off when I went into dungeons and nobody would talk to me.
---
Release a trailer or I throw myself off a building Blizzard not joking do it now.
---
Lol, same! Then I found out my friends all played Horde and I switched to a Tauren hunter... But I'll never forget my first footsteps in the game. They were in Dun Morogh, as a big-bearded Dwarf hunter. 
---
I'm Horde now, but something about Dun Morogh will always make me long to start there again. The music, the atmosphere, everything makes it so fun to level up to 10.
---
Silverpine is really good for levelling for a few levels, the quests are tightly bunched and there isn't too much running about. The Barrens are... barren. There's a lot of running time.
---
Nice to know it's usually resolved that quickly. Like I said, that was just my understanding, I haven't played WoW properly in a long time. If what you say is the usual, then right click reporting really is a non-issue.
---
Since everyone following the guide will be doing most quests in the game worthwile doing for the purpose of leveling, it won't help you much if they follow the same route. Actually, the opposite is more likely to be true, since they will be doing quests they would otherwise have missed.
---
Will you be playing Classic with us?
---
30 year old men: This is so deep.
---
Well that escalated quickly.
---
I'm playing gnome or orc womenz, just can't decide on faction
---
Yeah, another poster informed me that the squelch usually lasts for only 10-15 minutes if you contest it. In that case I agree, right click reporting is a non-issue.
---
I hope you're right about the community. We know what the community *used* to be like in Vanilla WoW, but we've yet to see if that can be recaptured. There are so many threads on this subreddit about people min/maxing and planning their speed runs that I can't help but be a bit pessimistic about the community aspect. It's not like we're all starting fresh and helping each other discover the game; we know exactly what we need to do if we want to "win". Here's hoping there is still a solid subset of casual interactions.
---
totally don't spoil it there
---
just dive in but do tell people ingame that u are new
---
"They make more money because more people want to play them. "
---
Not even remotely true. Only a minority of players in micro-transaction heavy games pay. They usually have smart populations for RPG and mmorpg.
---
What happens when servers cap at 5k and more players join than leave?
---
this is why I mock those preraid lists that don't include alternative items for the bis
---
*cries in Tauren*
---
So does this thread, and your comment. We have no details, whether you have them but chose not to gave them or just don't have them, so it's baseless gossip that's hard to make a judgement on. 
---
Yeah, that's why I wish there were some viable endgame melee staves.   Friar and Mauler in daoc could melee with staves and had weapon specs for them.  It was pretty cool.
---
Furrylover the druid approves this message
---
daggers is pretty good tho 
---
you will have daggers for cb/prep pvp 
---
and any raid can use a dagger rogue so lessen competition on swords so u gonna get ur weapons quicker than others
---
There could also be 5% tourists.
---
I understand what why the det date isn't optimal, but at the same time, some kind of time frame will make or break alot of stuff this summer, so.. I want more than "summer". Maybe early summer or even late summer. 
---
Many people at max level will never attain a decent looking set.  Most people will remain looking like hobos.  I think people are seriously over-estimating how much loot they will get.  Getting 3 or 4 pieces of one set is pretty good, and not easy.
---
Undead warriors with wotf and cannibalize are pretty nice for solo pvp. They are 2m cds but they are worth it. 
---
Maybe gnome for escape artist which aids in uptime on target. 
---
Stormform on a dwarf
---
Trolls get exerting with us a dps increase. 
---
I just really like undead. 
---
I will give a shout out to tauren. 2 sec stunncan be pretty nice when you're interior is down and you need to burst a healer
---
Basically every big title does it.  Marketing doesn't work extremely well other than launch day but we've been burned so many times it doesn't work anymore.
---
Fortnite wasn't huge until the battle royal, PUBG was basically an indy game, Apex legends came out of nowhere.  LoL didn't start huge it was pretty small starting out without tons of money to spend on marketing.  Warframe, PoE, rocket league, Stardew Valley, Slay the Spire are all games that as far I can remember didn't get tons of marketing especially initially but have done amazingly well.  While games like Anthem had all the money in the world for marketing and get torn apart at launch.
---
I think we're reaching a point where hopefully companies will learn having 20 million marketing budget doesn't help you if the game isn't fun anymore.  Reviews, streamers, and the like not being limited to a few sources makes it easy for the truth of shallow games to get out early.
---
owl on the right looks like it's checking out the one on the left, like the distracted boyfriend meme.
---
Have you seen Doraleous and Associates?
---
Friar..... and Mauler....... what a range, haha.
---
If you have a certain player you want to kill that shows up frequently you can make a macro "/target &lt;player name&gt;". Other than that you'll have to tab cycle or just manage a way to click on them. 
---
This is amazing 
---
If they were 100g then I believe so. If they were available for a 6 month window, which seems like a reasonable estimate, then people buying multiple isn't very far fetched in my mind, even slower players.
---
The thing with spell batching is it's not something that you really play around, it's more that it just randomly generates funny interactions like mages sheeping each other, I wouldn't consider that to have an impact.
---
So practically no, you won't be proving Spirit Tap and Imp DS on the same mob, but there's two of you and you'll be so efficient it doesn't really matter, since stacking that many dots on mobs is insanely efficient already, and renew on a warlock which they can then convert back into mana is already a massive engine of efficiency makes priest/lock still a solid duo. The only real downside between the combo is the degree to which your gearing overlaps.
---
higher debuff limits
---
it could make arms more valuable and some warriors need to roll for 2h so u don't have half the raid fighting over 1h swords
---
Don't bother with current wow, play classic, and most importantly, don't read any guides. Experience the magic for yourself. You occupy a position everyone on this subreddit envies, make the most of it
---
Hi, /u/Finally_Vanilla
---
a hunter trainer in elwynn
---
This is on a private test server. Inaccurate quest exp was fixed a year ago, dynamic respawns isn't on a private test server, and as for the minion quiest exp whatever that is about, few mobs in the game has a minion and the leveling was done with via primarily questing so I very much doubt it any kind of exp thing was abused especially since the speedrunner is fucking Joana the guy who set the record in vanilla.
---
Both can theoretically proc Spirit Tap and Improved Drain Soul with spell batching.
---
The issue is: you have to kill the monster at the same time (Dot / wand / AA / spell). You will lost so much time/mana trying to do this.
---
The best way is doting every mob and chose one of you finishing it.
---
recently being 1 year ago.
---
pretty sure it's current rank but R3 is very easy to get even by just killing enemy on sight while lvling
---
Hank and Jed used to be my go to channel to watch.
---
Not sure what has happened to them recently though
---
I’m gonna make a 39 Twink with alchemy (and engi) for the cds. That way he’s not only used for the cds.
---
Pretty much this, emphasis again on the mana, you OBLITTERATE people, by people i mean one guy, then you're oom and need to drink.

Uppside to spriest is that you, unlike alot of other classes, dont rely on any cds to be strong. You're pretty much never gonna feel like you lost a brawl because "all my shit was on cd from my other fight 2 min ago", you're always strong af with your massive shield and dmg, but you have to drink after every 1-2 kills, litteraly.
---
I am myself thinking of going spriest in vanilla, i rly dislike the mana issues, but i love the none existing cd dependencies. Vanilla cds are usualy looooong af. Like 5-60min with a few at 3min. 
---
If you're duoing your efficiency isn't going to be hurt as long as one of you gets the last hit. 
---
Hear, hear!
---
What movie is this?
---
Right because joana guide kills a lot of bloodsail imps does it?
---
There's a lot of descriptives between vanilla, pservers and actual classic, next thing you gonna say is that when he breaks the classic leveling record that it's flawed because of sharding or some shit.

My wife and 18 month old will be travelling to her home country to visit her parents. I'm staying home, because I can't use all of my vacation time to go. I am PRAYING that WoW gets released during the time she's gone. 
---
But wasnt the tradeoff that it resulted in needing to drink a lot more?
---
iirc they made it need to be casted more, but didnt reduce mana cost
---
You are either misreading that or being dishonest. In the very image you link, he says the cap was “more or less” 3k. He says the hardware could at maximum handle 3500-4000. Nowhere does he say the cap was 4k. You can at best claim the cap was “more or less 3k.”
---
It's not like they are rebuilding the game from scratch. I understand your point, with newly released games, but they're just re-working old content. I know it's still a huge task, but I fully expect them to be on schedule with this stuff, and I don't think releasing a date this close to summer is unreasonable. 
---
I agree when it comes to raid loot. But there are craftable sets, dungeon sets and the PvP sets.
---
Why is that? I loved this game because it was so social.
---
Druids are never tedious in the sense of the word. You get ranged dps and heals from lv 1 , and bear form may as well be cat form - it's so efficient once you get it, it feels wrong
---
Ok, this is great.
---
Nicely done. 
---
Probably the best idea so you dont feel like a waste of a character just for the CD, especially if you were gonna twink anyway 
---
I'd rather be a burden to the raid while looking awesome than being a first dps hobo 
---
Heya! long time no see :)

Shawshank Redemption.
---
Friars were a release class, Maulers were added very, very late in the game's lifecycle (Labyrinth of the Minotaur xpac).   DAoC had a *HUGE* range in classes and playstyles, because they had three realms(factions) instead of two, all of which had more classes than WoW, and NONE of which were mirrored classes until the Mauler (last class to be added that I'm aware of), which is the only class all three realms share.

you two are more or less agreeing 
---
tri-shotting comes down more to gear and stats than it does skill, after all
---
I read the whole thing in his voice
---
They pretty much are building it from scratch. Classic was lost a long time ago. The data we have from private servers was input by the creator of the original one. We don't actually know the values of monsters, drop rates, item procs, and skill values. Those were all lost.
---
It depends if it's your first char on a starting server or if it's an alt that is over geared.
---
Some servers had balanced factions, so in that respect it wouldn’t be a change. I mean, it is generally unlikely that you will be on a server in Classic that has the exact same faction balance as the server you played on back in Vanilla.
---
Going through the struggles of this at work right now, and it sucks to have to have something delivered by X date. You ultimately miss the mark, and don't get buy in once it is released, because you missed this or that.  You only get one first impression as they say.
---
All trainers in all majors.
---
Retail? More like BOREtail!
---
I also considered something similar. But when I actually started playing the I found a secret strategy: Joining a guild and making friends.
---
Now wouldn't it be nice if all AAA game companies would act this way.
---
Blizz, you have a nice thing going with classic... **Please take us out of this video game runt the industry is in.**
---
Really? Damn, that sucks. I would think a company like Blizzard would've archived that shit. Heck, I thought most companies would after SOE screwed up and lost all of their old Star Wars Galaxies data (when they turned it into the shit version it was before it died). 
---
I feel kinda similar. Whenever I played retail I saw WoW as the shadow of the giant it once was. I looked at all those naive players around me who didn't know any better and I felt kinda sad for them. I knew that this game once had some soul to offer.
---
4 slot Old Blanchy's Feed Pouch. Good chunch of XP, shit rewards.
---
How are they a given?
---
The legendary iron man.  Make that as the only change to vanilla.  The only way to achieve it, is to get a legendary without ever dying.
---
Im for both games, i like things from both and wish i could mix and match, but thats not happening.
---
So something like the name of the month. Seems reasonable. 
---
Their release was so awesome, zero marketing or hype (chance for people to get their hopes up -&gt; dissapointment). Announced it ONLY when it was polished and ready. And it was a HUGE success. I'm totally fine with Blizz doing the same thing. I want this experience to be great, I understand it won't be identical to 2004-5, but I'm willing to give them all the time they need in order to do it right.

Wtf, I guess I completely forgot the end of that movie.  Guess it's time to rewatch.
---
Two word : Power Leveling
---
Just got a paladin buddy helps tag mob in instance, someone posted a screenshot of his lvl 35 alchemists alts on the LH subreddit and he leveled them in +- 8h
---
You'll need one when that reality check hits you and you realize how braindead easy vanilla is. 
---
EP/GP didn't replace DKP, it was simply another option.
---
Good for them.
---
Yeah but when Activision bought out blizzard in what, mid tbc? I don't think they thought their hype for wotlk would end. If we saw what cataclysm would do to us.. eh. Maybe.
---
Earn currency by doing stuff for the guild.
---
Spend currency by getting stuff from the guild.
---
Ok, but if you have 3-4 fury warriors, and one picks up vis'kagg and another BRE on one of your first full raid weeks, it is 100% going to be better DPS for the warrior who got BRE to switch to 2h until he gets 2 1handers as good as brutality blade or better. A human warrior with BRE can shit out damage no problem in BWL. 
---
Several guilds will be inclined to give rogues the daggers first, if only to prevent them from whining. 
---
Not really, melee hits are much easier to land against high level targets than spells. Spellcasters would hit 10% of their spells at best while warriors/hunters would miss 10-15% of them at most. 
---
If you have a good enough 2hander, you just use that for fury raiding.
---
60% riding is 100 Gold though.
---
1k Gold is for 100% riding.
---
Seems like you got a little confused in either your post or the title.
---
You could use this argument for any change request, though.
---
I do believe when you hype up the game in terms of trailers etc people get their own expectations and if the game doesnt live up to the expectations you wont enjoy it as much. Releasing Apex Legends as they did people had no expectations what so ever so which is great I believe :)
---
Also, pre-release is prime development time for any project, when the pipeline is the smoothest, and when the most people are working on it. There's a lot that developers can do these days to patch and fix things after release, but it will never be as quick and efficient as if it had been solved prior to launch. The classic team has been getting a lot of good will recently, for listening to and implementing community suggestions. The last thing we want is for them to look at a good piece of community feedback and be forced to ask "this is great, but do we really have time to include it?"
---
Better to have a complete product, ready when it's ready. We've waited a long time for classic WoW, it's worth waiting a little longer to get it right.
---
&gt; What, do you think it's literally impossible to go more than 4D 20H? 
---
No, of course not. But considering the known leveling issues with private servers, I think it's pretty presumptuous to assume that a huge 20% drop in leveling time is not suspicious. And let's not pretend that a 20% drop in leveling time isn't huge.
---
Improved Drain Soul is already funny enough as it is.
---
I think you missed the point this isn't about making profession mats its about making gold.  It would be selfish to just ask my guild for gold.
---
At this point I can’t take off more than 1 day anyways.  I have to submit my vacation time in December for the entire year.   
---
Let her know that even thought it's a silly thing for an adult to be hyped about it means a lot to you and you are planning on taking your earned vacation days to play games. But if she means a lot to you, you should probably use some of those days to spend with her. Hopefully you can both be supportive of each other's needs and openly share your feelings. 
---
Or maybe don't listen to dating advice on a WoW forum, of all places lol.
---
That was good. Thanks for that. 
---
I completely agree on the 4-5k cap. I believe that has been a standard for games with standard server setups and it's worked well. Aion when it first came out had a cap of 5k and it felt perfect. 3k would be too small here. Hopefully Blizz realises this and increases it to 5k. Besides, it's a perfect middle ground between those that want 2-3k and those that want 8k.
---
Exactly I do believe trailers etc to hype up a gamer and give ppl expectations are really bad tbh because ppl will get their own expectations of the game before the release and if it doenst live up to that they wont enjoy it that much
---
To make a long story short, decent loot is much more rare than in retail.  It's an accomplishment at max level to retire your last green item, and a massive accomplishment to get full epic (which most people won't get).  The difference in satisfaction is unquantifiable partially because everyone is different, but mostly because players don't get issued full blues/epics like they do in retail.  Chances are great that you'll never run across an epic until you start raiding at max level.  Rare items are....rare while leveling too.  The levels are a much longer slog, so you're more acquainted with your gear too.
---
Can you name half of the items that your max level retail character has equipped now?  I sure as hell can't.  Soulspun casque....that's it.  But I can tell you that my level 60 warrior had the unstoppable force, wyrm pauldrons, sapphiron scale boots, stronghold gauntlets, bracers and belt of might, muth'thol helm, carrot on a stick, essence of eranikus.  Whatever it is that instilled that memory is the difference between retail loot and classic loot.  
---
You could use this argument to justify any change request, though.
---
Thats just a private server bug.  On retail you'll have to lvl them organically.
---
Its all the mages in that tower, with the quest mob at the top
---
Trolls are getting bored of the official forums it seems.
---
I have a spreadsheet with joanas original times for every 10 levels. I use it then add +50% as my time to beat. Although his 1-10 is really slow relatively speaking but I think that’s just hunters having a slow 1-10 more than anything. Anyway though if you want me to list out his times for each bracket I’d be happy to.
---
The world isn’t any more at war than you where can’t decide to be a murdering psycho and kill your own faction.  There are rules in place that reflect that.  That’s the difference between a PvP and a PvE realm.  PvP, the conflict is far more active and there is the understanding that the other faction is fair game.  PvE, the conflict is less pronounced to the point you have to agree to mutual combat. 
---
Going back to the original point made about there being plenty of PvP on RP realms, there is.  It’s all mutual combat engaged in by people actively choosing to do so.  Trying to play “b-b-b-but the blue wall” is silly, since no one is saying there shouldn’t be an RP-PvP server.  Those are the rules agreed to by everyone playing on the server, just like playing on a PvP realm means you have to put up with all the stuff that happens there because you chose to play there.
---
Someone tells you they’re tired of getting ganked in STVietnam, you tell them to go roll their carebear ass on a PvE server.  You want to complain about the “blue wall”, go roll on a PvP.   The only contention here is whether an RP-PvP server will be available, and if it’s not, well, pick your poison.  No rules say you can’t RP on a regular PvP server, or you can’t constantly invite people to mutual combat on an RP server.  
---
I feel bad for anyone who doesn't have SSD in 2019

Not sure what you're talking about.  You can already raid enemy faction cities and kill their leaders for honor.  Not sure what you're wanting exactly.

It was good, yes, but it didnt last half a year... More like under a month then he had a local up for him and his friends
---
Everyone keeps saying this and it's becoming a meme. Yes shadow priests have an advantage in 1v1, but they are not immortal. Their reputation goes back to vanilla when people had no idea how to play against them. A hunter, mage or warlock can beat a shadow priest in a 1v1
---
Well, Yes, but the concept of rewarding points for contributing is something they both share.
---
Orcs have the dope racial for natural stun resist. Makes a huge difference in PvP.
---
Agreed. It is especially relevant with disconnects/crashes. I've had fights where I as a tank or healer disconnected or crashed and get back to the fight quickly enough to prevent wiping.

You are not reading that right. In the image you posted, Mark literally confirms the caps where “3k, more or less” and not 4k.
---
Yeah for sure just my friend wants to play paladin so rip
---
I think they should add resilience.
---
Even what not to do is useful information
---
It's strange to me that Blizzard wasn't able to see the demand for it. Were they just too proud to admit there was demand for a legacy version of WoW?
---
Ive bought and subbed for every xpac, but since mop it was just... sub for a month, hit max level, then meh, unsub
---
I mean SSD's make basically everything better on your computer, including never having to listen to that chunking spin up sound.
---
no.
---
For real. I got a Headmaster's Charge on my priest during the TBC prepatch. I was the first in our guild of ~120 level 60 characters to get it. And it was certainly not for lack of running Scholo.
---
Cue my amusement when I see it in BiS lists.
---
A 2% chance means that you need to run the whole of Scholo 114 times just to get a 90% chance to see it drop. And then there's likely to be 2 or 3 other people who want it as well.
---
&gt; it's becoming a meme
---
This was one of the original memes in early vanilla. Probably *the* vanilla WoW meme.
---
Back then we didn't call it a "meme" but SPriests in vanilla were very strong in WPvP. So everytime someone asked this question people would answer "You will melt faces as a shadow priest in PVP" or something similar.
---
There were threads on the official forums that were basically just people rewording that sentence for hundreds of times.
---
Tirisfal is taking all the Horde vote.
---
This is why we need ranked voting for stuff like this.
---
Where is your evidence that the amount of players joining post launch minus the amount of players leaving amounts to 1-1.5k?
---
Right in the feels. Damn this was well done
---
&gt;Why am I assuming he won't do M+? Because he has no reason to. There is no nothing special to be had in M+ that you can't get from just doing world quest and heroic dungeons.
---
I think the Mythic+ Affixes do a decent job of making the end game dungeon content more varied, and when you get to higher keys, most roles have to play seriously.
---
The problem a new player who has only run through the "Single Player Content" would have with getting into Mythic+, is that without being in a friendly guild, no group would accept a player without a [Raider.IO](https://Raider.IO) score when they can choose someone with some experience. 
---
 Also this is a CLASSIC sub. People here are here because we don't like Retail. If we did we'd play it and not wait for years for the original version. If you love the game so much go play it. Don't know why you're shocked people here aren't fans of the new Wow's systems. 
---
Just because people are hyped for Classic doesn't have to mean they think everything about Retail is bad. Mythic+ is great content if you have a group you like to spend time with in game. It's horrible if you don't have a regular group.
---
Took around 20 minutes for me aswell. My daily routine was pretty much to wake up, turn computer on, go to the toilet and half sleep there for \~10 minutes, go back to the computer which has finally booted up, launch WoW, go make breakfast, come back and play while eating.
---
Nowadays I sit on a m.2 ssd and I'm spoiled like crazy. (For the people wondering, m.2 is not worth it if you plan on buying one to load games faster. You will gain roughly 1 second every loading screen).
---
Not an issue! I'm a teacher in training so these are a way of me to test the waters and see what I can do to make it as effective and accurate as I can. Some professors and mentors have worded things much more harshly to me before. 
---
These have also been mentioned in other comments and the numbers will be adjusted in the newer version! Thank you for the reply.
---
I agree this is most likely, but it may not be if everybody wanting an authentic experience stay quiet and the only voices they hear are from those wanting to change the game.

Should work on classic but we'll see :) otherwise I would recommend hunter, warlock are great but more reliant to their spell and does not have aspect of the cheetah. Hunter specced bm can level to 35 naked and don't need to stop as often to learn their spells since the pet does all the work. 
---
If you speed run to lvl 35 it should be feasible in +-20h /played
---
Since when was sulfuras weapon that went to ppl with ret offspec over warriors?
---
Such a powerful scene. High quality post!
---
A lot of people will try it out and then stop playing. It could people who were too young in 2004 who find out that they just don't like that version of the game or it could be returning players who find themselves not having time or whatever.
---
It's pretty accurate. Log in for a bit every day and wait for shit to cool down.
---
I really hope it stays expensive for the actual mount. That makes a lot more sense to me. Why would the training be super expensive, and this huge trained beast be cheap? Why should a driving class cost more than a car? Furthermore, if the mounts themselves are really expensive, then the mount you choose is pretty much the one you're stuck with. It makes it a big, weighty decision and really becomes an overall aspect of your character's style. If everyone can only reasonably get one mount, then this whole Retail idea of playing mix-and-match dress up with your character goes out the window, and the end result is that the world feels a lot more weighty and real. 
---
I would appeal to blizzard to keep the mounts more expensive as part of keeping a real-world feel within the gaming environment.
---
I've seen enough discussion here and on the official forums but none of that gives us a clear idea of what the majority opinion is. We can discuss the topic all day but it won't get us anywhere. Let's see what the numbers tell us!
---
they should also probably include mass teleport to mages because it is not fair to take away their best CLASSIC ability
---
Let's just hope it doesn't end up like poor old Brooks.
---
I would hate to be completely new to WoW and to start playing modern wow. There's just so much shit you have to know and do that I don't think it would be enjoyable. There's plenty to do and know in classic wow, but it's a game with a somewhat linear path to learning how to play it. I'd wait for classic, or play the current game so you can see how crap it is I guess
---
It's a small team working on a side project that is lead directly by the demand of the fans for it. That's the difference between Classic and Retail.
---
What cinematic? The classic launch? Why do you think this? Lol
---
But I dont comment on Naxx, because you're definitely right -- I have never set foot in it in Vanilla.  It was just too much rep grind for the attunement, if I remember correctly.  Very few people I knew personally ever managed it.
---
&gt; Some servers had balanced factions
---
Absolutely, they just didn't have forced balance. The imbalance started creeping in during later expansions, vanilla for the most part was pretty balanced.
---
I would rather them stick to the 'classics'
---
it's done when it's done.
---
preset release date are among the many reasons that have brought the doom of many butchered xpac releases.
---
Mate, you need to change jobs. That's ridiculous!

Paladin anything.  Most un-fun class to play; I got one to level 4 before I got sick of it.  
---
Hah, current wow is more accessible, I wasn't sure if this was a troll post until that sentences
---
Youre overststing the chanced of this happening. Esfand is "famous", op is not
---
What about "Moohamed"?
---
That's true. I don't expect Blizz to make the items Bind on Use if they bring them back, though.
---
The other thing is because they're basing Classic on 1.12, cloth turn ins could be a thing, and more importantly, faction wide quest rep is probably a thing, making exalted with Darkspear possible. 
---
So I know once you hit level 40 you switch to arms for mortal strike. But from 10-40 do you go 2h fury or dual wield fury. 2h seems to be pretty solid but looking for anyone who has leveled to offer some input
---
Armor looks decent all the way around 
---
What gave you the impression that I hate classic? I'm simply pointing out reasons why the game isn't as perfect as people here make it out to be. Although I do find it funny judging by the upvotes how insecure people are about Vanilla.
---
Ling Ling practices WoW 40 hours a day

I want to immerse myself in the world. I want to feel like it's a journey i'm making. I'm not am elf. I'm not an orc. I'm not a gnome. I'm a human. I connect best with that race.
---
I always get hit by frostbite when going against mages in PvP! It's incredible. Impact is not nearly as good imo.
---
Most builds want to push for maximum numbers and damage because its easier to sell online and when theorycrafting. In practice, stuns strong like you'd expect (though not as strong as Dota).
---
Even random stuns are good, like in Dota, with bash chance. Also like in Dota, they work best in group pvp. There's nothing stopping you from experimenting with pvp speccs at 60. You'll find that when you have allies helping you, a stun on an enemy will usually get them killed.
---
this is an interesting thought.  i think resilience would make the "meme" specs (like paladin, or unholy) be much better and balance the horde/alliance ratio as well.
---
its well known BC was the pinnacle of war craft pVp so resilience is a good idea IMO
---
Love this 
---
I'm not saying it wasn't, my point is that I think a lot of people are going to be surprised at how they aren't to get every single piece of gear they think they are. You often end up using whatever falls to you, in my case, daggers.
---
Yeah, this would be cool. But come on man. "Classic won't be classic to me unless" and "this matters much more to me than spell batching"
---
A bit dramatic, don't you think? Don't shit on a nice touch they added, especially when asking for another. You can give feedback without making it a hill to die on.
---
Yeah, I definitely cant argue there, but I remember this being the best way for me to manage removing debuffs via decursive on the right side while watching all of the warriors in the Warrior group + the groups I was responsible for healing in the raid (and I figured I might as well throw the rest of the groups up if Im watching that side and another healer needed help.
---
But it definitely was cluttered.
---
To be fair these scenes are near the middle.
---
Well, what are the stats on DPS vs Tank warrior pop? Suppose I'm a pure tank, could I easily carve out a niche for myself?
---
Ooo I like the mouse wheel idea, think im going to grab that so I can get used to it during leveling. What do you personally do to zoom in or out after that? 
---
Killing all the bullies in stv.
---
Sunken Cost Fallacy.
---
They spent so much time working on Retail not realizing it was a disaster. That is my humble opinion. Played whatever-the-fuck expansion a few summers ago and got to level 105 in less than a month. From the moment  I was re-learning all of my abilities and stuck in an endless sequence of action cutscenes fighting alongside the Horde and Alliance leaders, I knew the game was no longer salvageable.
---
Another idea, they should make classic exclusive on the Epic Game Store.
---
For a lot of people this is the answer. My friend played nothing but Human Paladin his entire WoW career.
---
Hah, one drink each at a club, that's a good one
---
Just the brewmaster?  Why not tbe other 2 monk specs?
---
Ive seen the video of Oaken and I'm a big fan of AoEing as a paladin as well.  The issue is gear also.  You need to be able to kill those elites quick or they will kill you by forcing you to heal yourself and you run out of mana.   Even if the instance tag strat is viable I don't think they will be able to get you to lvl 35 because of their gear.  However Dead Mines and Stockades should still be viable.  But Tier 1 just don't have much spell power.  You really are reliant on the Tier 2 gear and once you get that you can explode with AoEing.  Actually getting 5/5 Tier 2.5 lets you AoE even higher lvl dungeons pretty easily like SM cath making you an even stronger power lvler to something like lvl 45.

Man I completely can relate to this. Downloaded retail after a ten year break and everything’s so different. I just turned it off and will wait for classic.

Still makes me sad though.

Yeah, you just don't see them is all.  ^.^
---
Damn. I hope you feel some sort of bad.
---
Although I cannot tell you how many times we jacked bottles of Jack from grocery stores. One dude in a trench coat would steal handles.

Lol but loot trading is still going to ruin the game. Just because you think you explain yourself well and know what you’re talking about doesn’t mean anything, loot trading is still one of the worst decision for the quality of the game

Problem with that place is it's too linear, all areas come off from one main 'spine' until the harpy area at the top. Glad I missed it first time around as I didn't enjoy it too much the second time 
---
Emperor Runs in BRD. Loved that with my buddies back in the day. 
---
No. Those talents are equivalent to spell hit% that comes from gear, just restricted to a school. Shadow focus 5/5 = same as having 10% increased spell hit from the gear. It is not related to spell resistances or penetration.
---
I'm not sure it counts as one thing, but seeing my character (and others) slowly get better looking gear as I level up.
---
Not an heirloom to be seen!
---
jumping from the AH roof on the palmtree
---
w8 nvm Im going ally now. I need the SW music.
---
Shiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeeett
---
Agreed. Cata killed the game.
---
But you start from level 1 on private servers so I don't see the difference. Maybe you can pay for a boost to 58 in TBC or something. Whatever, I'm only concerned with Classic at this time.
---
I meant, if you keep your moss in the bank, waiting for better prices in the future, you can't use that capital to buy a mount now... 
---
Hell yea. I've been there.
---
bad time between jobs and family issues. $15 a month for nightly entertainment was great.
---
"Forcekin" isn't on it! Yes...
---
You’ll be fine.  Priests can farm DM east as well as pallies.  You’ll want herbalism though.
---
Ah, I see you are a man of culture as well ^.^
---
Brooks was here. 
---
Are you retarded? First this is a month old, second I am right in everything I said, and third loot trading has been fixed already. You should probably look before you post.
---
This made me laugh out loud at work. Thank you.
---
I think your poll could have used a lot more granularity - many obvious potential values are missing. A lot of people are throwing around 2.5k as a number, for example (it's not my preference, but a lot of people believe it's historical.) And there's a fairly significant gap between numbers in general. I would have suggested number ranges, possibly with a comment request for exceptionally low or high numbers.
---
Personally, I voted 5k, but I'd actually prefer a somewhat lower cap, somewhere nearer 4k, 4.5k at most.
---
That’s nice but some people have standards and realize it’s garbage who’ve played good games before... especially when said garbage used to be amazing.
---
This.
---
Yikes did my master troll wake you up from your baby nap? 
---
This sub alone has many players that choose race based on nothing other than racial bonuses.  Some don't even see WoW as a RPG, it's just a G.
---
A Warlock with a pocket healer will never run out of mana. The priest will max dps with a wand. You've got a pocket tank pet and more dots and fears than some 5-man groups. That duo cannot possibly have mana problems, so I wouldn't worry about it.
---
Gnome is the master race.
---
Sorry to hear that slugger, but don't be so hard on yourself
---
And don't worry, you may not have played vanilla but you'll get something close to the experience with classic
---
Interesting.. never heard of that.  So 20,000 gold would get spent on items in MC?  Would you just find a non guildie that was loaded and run them through? How did y’all determine the cost of items?
---
But it would be an April Fools. So they actually ARE working on it!
---
Well to be honest I think that sort of granularity wouldn't help. That's part of the problem with the discussion threads is that there's too many different ideas being thrown around to really come to any sort of consensus.
---
The way you can enjoy a lot more loot than you do currently is to branch out into other parts of the game. Yes, a lot of gear is not BiS for *raiding* like Helm of Endless Rage, Breastplate of the Chromatic Flight, Spinal Reaper, Death Grips, Eshkandars Collar etc. etc.
---
But if you actually do all parts of content including premade PvP, world PvP, hepling lowbies out in dungeons, AoE farming, duo farming with a mate and a huge plethora of other parts of how vanilla can be played items start to have value. 
---
Essence of the Pure Flame  [https://classicdb.ch/?item=18815](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18815)  is huge crap for 99% of raid content, but it's great for the over 9000th strat live run in which you carry yet another preRaid farming resto shaman that just got 60 and was invited into your guild.
---
In the same manner tier gear you eventually collect as every warrior for your sporadic tank duties in raids enables you to offtank AQ20 or ZG, or maybe you can start your own ZG runs as MT, so you can make your own decisions regarding ZG enchants.
---
Point is: change your vision from 100% focused on raiding and lots of items in raids and out in the world become valuable.
---
You’re kidding right? Just because you didn’t see a commercial didn’t mean they didn’t pay for marketing, they most certainly spent millions on marketing. They paid for twitch streamers to play there game and vital internet posts. This isn’t wild stipulation either, I know this for a fact.
---
Then your experience is pretty unique. I played a warrior on private servers and charge basically didn't work. What happens in classic is you charge and because of the way the spell works. The person on the recieving end can run out of hamstring range before you reach him. SO the ability doesn't work. When I spoke to other NA players they said this problem was common and thats why they all played casters.
---
I felt the same way since 3.3
---
lol
---
It would take giant chunks of your pvp points away and drop your rank 
---
Resub two months before the next expansion, see all the content. Level at launch. Log out until the end.
---
Rince and repeat, since panda for me.
---
So I know April fools is going to consist of SOMETHING classic.... And I know no matter what they say about classic its going to PISS me off... Especially knowing its fake. 
---
They could say "Just kidding you dont want classic wow"   
---
Or they could say "Classic wow is releasing next week"
---
Or they could say "Classic wow is releasing June 4th"
---
All of the above will piss me the fuck off just hearing those words on a fake day. 
---
Retail has been dead since Cata. Legion was just a muscle spasm.
---
They are present there, as far as I've heard. Let's just hope they'll drop something.
---
Yeah I think so. They are near that long river. Great grind spot.
---
Im talking about advertisement _BEFORE_ the game is out.
---
Once streamers got paid to advertise the game everyone could play it.
---
Yeah, I’d say the poll would at least need 2.5k and 4k included to be a useful gauge of interest.
---
As a pre-teen back in vanilla my allowance was $15 a month. Absolutely worth it.
---
Bring Illidan out of outlands and have him patrol Azshsra.
---
You can disagree, but people like me were told we are not welcome in classic.
---
That case is closed for me.
---
Bit of a strawman, ones a single variable, the other a complete set of developments. 
---
Gotcha
---
I'm the opposite. I am a human and I'm playing a video game. I always pick something I am not and attempt to see the world thru their eyes not my own eyes. It's my chance to be something I am not.
---
is that tonald drump?
---
This list doesn’t bring the mage to hitcap and doesn’t include Spellweaver’s Turban, unless that was added in a later patch 
---
Oooof!
---
Excellent work, well done. Have a candle.
---
Alright, I'll say it. Blizzard's communication isn't nearly as bad as everyone says it is. The backlash of BFA is a great example of Blizzard realizing that communication is a bad idea, and waiting it out is the best course of action. People shat all over the AMA that was done a few months after BFA launched. Every single comment by the dev team was downvoted to oblivion. 
---
OW, HotS, and the Classic team have been knocking it out of the park, but I have no sympathy for current WoW players who bitch about no communication. They ruin any dev who says anything about the game no matter what. I wouldn't want to communicate with those rabid fucks either. Just make changes to the game in silence and hope their tiny attention spans move onto something else. 
---
Forgetting to do daily quests hmmmmffff 
---
Also DA. An Elven god ruined the whole world.
---
The only elves I respect are the elves from the Witcher universe.
---
The Tauren shaman prophet who takes over Thrall's business. Nice one hehe 
---
Lol no I have the silkiest slippers of any player regardless of my class. My brothers favorite thing to do is farm gold and he always ends up playing a mage because of this. He then never needs the money because he hates leveling he only likes farming. So eventually he starts "lending" me gold. This man has "lent" me over 30k gold across many private servers lol.
---
My gf has only barely tried wow back in the day, not with me. Seeing my excitement for classic and her love for hearthstone has made her willing to try it on launch. :)
---
I am super excited to relive the experience and also seeing her live it for the first time. :)
---
At the beginning of Vanilla I had whisps from random people just because I had T1 leggings on my warrior ! Imagine my chock when I came back on the game in Legion after leaving at the beginning of TBC oO
---
I think so, otherwise it would be really painful to get a mount at 40 and 60.
---
I doubt Blizzard have an exact date ready, but I always imagined they're targeting early summer, as that allows the project to be delayed internally while still technically coming out in "summer".
---
Well done OP.
---
This whole movie is gold material for retail vs Classic.
---
Red’s probation scene:
---
*“Your files say you’ve played 15 years of World of Warcraft. Do you feel you’re having fun?”*
---
“‘Fun’? Well now let me see...no I don’t have any idea what that word means.”
---
*“Well it means you’re using LF—“*
---
“I know what it means, sonny. It’s just a made up word for young fellas like yourself so you can have a transmog, cross faction AH, keystones. What do you really wanna know? Do I think the game is better today?”
---
*“well, do you?”*
---
“There’s not a day goes by I don’t miss Vanilla. Not because I’m on retail or because you think I shouldn’t. I look back on who I was then: a young, stupid hunter who committed that terrible ninja looting. I wanna talk to him. I wanna give him a second chance to do it right. But I can’t. That game is long gone. BfA is all that’s left. ‘Fun’ is just a bullshit word...so you go ahead and give me another lvl110 boost and stop wasting my time.”
---
/stamps Classic logo on parole sheet 
---
It does because when ZG launches you get +1% Hit on both the head and leg slots, so you only need 8% on the gear.  
---
Spellweaver's Turban was introduced in patch 1.10 which Blizzard talked about a few days ago in a blue post, it's not gonna be there at launch.
---
Same.
---
I haven t played since vanilla, and all of a sudden a beastmaster hunter can run two simultaneous pets?
---
Bonkers stuff.
---
Great stuff :)
---
You should do a follow up about Andy telling Red about the things they'll do in Classic, like the way he told him about Zihuatanejo in the film.
---
Through the goalposts after being punted.
---
They have never done that.  They have always tried to correct the issue by moving people from high pop to low...and it didn’t work, generally.
---
They flipped at patch 1.12.....
---
Yeah everything seems so foreign now
---
Ah! Yeah. That will make a difference. 
---
Gnome Warriors are funny to me, BUT! Escape Artist is a damn good ability.
---
Humans get weapon specs which helps the chance on hit.
---
Night Elves have the Shadowmeld memes, but not sure how good that is for Warriors vs. something that can nuke from stealth I.e hunters.
---
Dwarves got the Stoneform, which will help fights against Rogues.
---
I think your hardest match up is vs ranged with roots, ie Frost Mages. With that in mind, Gnome.
---
Downside? You’re a god damned gnome. 
---
Ah, but the C’Thun cosmological argument...
---
I use shift + mouse wheel up and down, because I get severe tunnel vision in PvP and clutch my mouse very tight in engagements, therefore it happens that I fatfinger the scrollwheel sometimes. 
---
what you are hinting at is the athene exploit.  That's a bannable offense and included in the EULA ever since bliz found out about it.
---
Late June would be horrible. I wouldn't be prepared at all for my exams. 
---
He is as smart as Jon Snow now.
---
I leveled DW fury and switched to arms at 40 and imo DW 20-40 is way more fun than 2h since you don't have to wait 3.3s between each attack... It was an alt so he was pretty well geared (fiery weapon and shit) but I was doing more dps than a 2H arm/fury in dungeon
---
I played priest but never got T2 8/8. I want that rank 5 renew on my gheals!!!
---
the big question here is.
---
how is that crafting going for this character. sitting at azuregos' or kazzak's spawn with bags full of soul shards ? :/
---
So the raid leader did make it a requirement that 2k gold had to be shown in trade to raid.  You would flash your gold at first,  remember if you didn’t have the gold it wouldn’t let you show that in trade?  Well most items sold for about 400-1000.  Sometimes on a binding or something crazy the bids would go upwards of 10k!  With about 2-4 epics per boss it wasn’t very hard to get up to that price range.  Oh and all crafting materials like dark iron or core leather was also sold.  It got crazy from time to time.  We rarely sharded items, and usually we carried about 10-15 people through.  Once we got to GDKP for BWL we were much more selective, set pieces sold for about two-three times as much.  Progression was a guarantee for the buyers.  Sometimes you could pre buy an item if you had enough cash... 
---
0/10 - if everyone knows it's a troll post, it's not a good one
---
C’Thun.
---
Yes, this also creates a problem where people buy a bunch of unarmored mounts for a couple hundred gold and hold on to them to re-sell them later. A lot harder to do that when they cost $1000+
---
You're in the wrong neighborhood, friend. Retail WoW is a steaming pile of Kodo poo.
---
i went from quitting BFA and being disappointed because there was nothing to play, to having a ton of games. RoR 2, Sekiro, Apex, Division 2, Mutant Year Zero, DMC 5, etc 
---
it's a good problem
---
Yes but what you have to take into account is that back then the population was growing, they tried to move people from full servers to empty ones.
---
This time around it'll probably be different and the population will be shrinking so the logical solution then is to move people from empty servers to populated ones.
---
 [https://imgur.com/gallery/kpSbrAg](https://imgur.com/gallery/kpSbrAg) 
---
I think a foreseeable effect of this would be that the only mounts we see are frostwolves and stormpike rams. These bad boys were significantly cheaper (I think they were only like 600g). This is another issue we have with effectively being able to see the future. Of course we don't know when AV will be released, but I'm sure that lots of people will hold their gold until AV mounts, and put the 400g they save into something else like a lionheart helm.
---
dude it's so good...soooo good
---
They could release a buggy mess that they slowly fix for months and I'd be just as content to get started on my character ASAP haha... Even if questing was broken I'd still be able to find a guild, level professions, etc.
---
I'm probably the minority though that is so desperately waiting the release that I'll take just about anything, even an unfinished product.
---
What would you recommend for a spec when doing 2h dps while raiding? Horde if that's important.
---
I know what you mean but in a good guild or between friends you'll constantly be sending materials to eachother etc. I just don't see the benefit of doing this anymore.
---
To fully level up an alchemist alt you'll be spending 200-300 gold for materials, recipees, skills etc. OP even wants to buy enchants to level it faster (very inefficient).
---
Then you'll be leveling that toon as well and do all the crafting. Leveling 50% breakpoint is about level 40ish and fast levelers have about 6 days played. So we're talking about 3 days if you do it efficiently. 3 days of farming is like 2-4k gold if you are reasonably efficient and double that amount if you tryhard.
---
So in order to make up for all of that his alt needs to generate about 3.5k gold with arcanite transmutes. Let's say it gets about 20g/day then the breakeven starts at about 175 days if you are logging in every single day.
---
Redefining low effort.
---
&gt;  mind controlling people off the great life in thousand needles 
---
That is not evil enough. They ress 30y away from where they die. YOU CAN DO BETTER!
---
I don’t think Hawking ever claimed to know this for a fact.
---
Ya just came in here to say this, it seems a brigade of extremely low quality trolls are showing up today
---
&gt; yeah what they did to a lot of the lore from wc3 is pretty garbage, 
---
This sounds premature. We don't even know what they're doing, yet. 
---
Durotar last... I cry :(
---
&gt;. The animation is rough and is reminiscent of Back at the Barnyard or Jimmy Neutron.
---
I'm glad its staying true to the original. 
---
I can't stand the human animations and armor, but I've only every rolled Night Elf to a significant level because I think they look the best by far &lt;cower&gt;
---
Could you elaborate? In my experience anything that provides mana or health regen is a positive for grinding speed, but I'm open to learning different strategies.
---
the guy I was discussing this with told me you could do it with a mix of t1 and off-set gear, doing dead mine 10-24 then gnomergang 25-35, maybe there was a stockade in between, don't remember.
---
Once T2,5 is out sure you can do SM easily but I would want my transmut-alt as soon as possible and not near the end of the game
---
Still 10 times more rewarding than retail though
---
I am looking forward to World PvP without higher levels ruining everything all the time! Only on fresh will you get pure wpvp ;)
---
Well you can do it as long as they don't catch you
---
Why are you happy about loot trading? I wont be able to join PuGs.. (old vanilla players have wife and kids now.. we need PuGs..)
---
My run was 
---
10-40 fury 
---
40-50 2h mortal strike 
---
51-60 furry. Two weapons. Couldn’t stand long swing time any more.  
---
My biggest tip is to use two different 1h when levelling up and keep the 3/4 option on you bag as once you level up max all weapon types. (Subpar damages on 10 mobs is fine instead of grinding the weapon from 1-300 at lv60).  
---
I liked furry more. But arms is probably faster.  
---
They fought a good "war": [The Legend of Nostalrius, the fight continues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qVjFyVyizw).
---
I had at least 5/8, but I don’t remember if I ended with more.  I wanted that 8/8 so damn bad...
---
I’m returning with priest because it was so much fun, but definitely getting 8/8 even if I have to minder people.
---
It's worth mentioning that dual wield isn't obtained until level 20. From what I understand it's way more effective to use a 2h because of the damage, hamstring kiting, easier to get. 
---
Because this comment thread was about Classic potentially being more popular than retail, and retail shutting down. WoW2 will probably only happen if they decide it's not worth making expansions for retail any more, which could be the case when there aren't enough people interested in retail any more, but interest in Classic is high. At that point, the answer to your question is simply: that's where the market is.
---
Of course this entire thread is mainly just daydreaming and not likely to happen but we're just thinking of what-ifs
---
"I know this for a FACT" okay settle down there Jobe hah
---
World PvP, either marauding through STV or hillsbrad trying to start a war, or attacking an enemy town and ctrolling it for hours while the other faction tries to fight back
---
Barrens/trade chat would never be the same without it. A necessary evil if it doesn't go to extremes. I like all the banter.
---
Do you have a screenshot that illustrates your point?
---
https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/143/590x/secondary/Warcraft-3-news-1583078.png?r=1541246246848
---
Doesn't look bad to me at all. (Unitswise, i have complaitns about the UI)
---
But in a theorycrafted maximum-regen-possible, maximum-kills-possible scenario getting both would be good, no? 
---
RP and Avatar Relatability: Humans are relatable. People connect well with Humans in general - the Human Fighter is also the most common Race/Class combo in D&amp;D as well, fun fact.
---
Visuals: Humans just work well with the game's aesthetics. Most armour sets and such are seemingly designed with Humans first in mind, and both the male and female models are generally considered attractive/aesthetically appealing.
---
Mechanics/Power: Humans are pretty strong for all classes they can take, and are basically never considered the "wrong" choice of race for a given class. Diplomacy is good for casuals and completionists, weapon specialisation is good for melee hit cap optimisation, spirit is good for casters... they basically have at least one synergy with every playstyle that is always relevant, while other races have more niche abilities that are only useful to some classes or only in some circumstances.
---
Relevance: Humans are the most important Alliance race in the narrative. Are they the best/most powerful/most interesting? No, but they're clearly established as the "primary protagonist" race in that regard, and have beeb for some time. Warcraft basically started out as Humans vs. Orcs (with some allies) and it still carries that backbone. In the game, this also manifests because holy hell there are humans everywhere. I'd guess that Humans make up the greatest number of named NPCs in the world by a long way, but I have no idea how to fact check that.
---
So much this. I've got 2 SSDs but still keep an old 500 GB hard drive for pictures and music. When I've got my fans completely off, the PC is silent. But that goddamn drive gets out of park position every 5 minutes or so. It's gotten super annoying.
---
I guess it's a first world problem, but still.
---
Thank you for your response. I've been using an mmo mouse but taking up 3 of those 12 extra buttons feels a waste and more clunky than mouse wheel so I'm going to give it a shot. 
---
Man, I guess I’m not too surprised about Durotar being last.
---
Grouping up for the echo isles quest for the first time made a lasting impression on me about the power of group play. I added my entire party to my friends list and watched them level during their journey to 60.
---
Also, on my mage I looted a green 2handed axe from a random troll on the isles. Weeks later I went there as a warrior and grinded for like 5 hours looking for that damn axe. I hadn’t quite figured out world drops by that point...
---
Alliance 
---
Human - weapon skill
---
Gnome - escape artist
---
NE - shadowmeld and +Dodge + faster Corps run speed.  
---
NE or Human for pve 
---
Gnome for pvp 
---
I know your delusions won't let you think otherwise, but most of vanilla was a grind-gated chore. Compare how much you get to see in the first 50 hours of retail vs vanilla. 15 days /played just to hit cap if you want to raid with friends. Hours finding a group and clearing a dungeon. You can't make any meaningful progress if you have an hour or two. 
---
When EP/GP came out, DKP didn't go away.
---
I agree, faction balance is the most important.  Even a 10% difference can feel bad leading to more people quitting on the ‘losing’ side, creating more faction imbalance.
---
Where would you put him? He needs at least quick access to a mailbox.
---
It literally doesn't matter. Statistically two people will kill more and faster than one person typically regardless of how well they are built or play. 
---
Classic was a very basic game using the information we have now.
---
Lol this sub, funny stuff guys. But just in case your question is serious, all characters will be human and start in the barrens at lvl 15 on release 
---
This is classic, literally and figuratively 
---
It only procs if the target dies close enough to a drain soul tick.  So if your DoTs kill it between ticks, you don't get the mana regen.
---
I plan on doing both extiensively so that makes it a bit harder
---
Retail was made for people like you. I don't suggest you bother trying classic when it comes out, good luck.
---
I honestly have no idea why people don’t just bid using gold with the idea that whoever wins the bidding pays the lootmaster their bid, which then gets sent to the raid in equal shares.  The people bidding on higher demand items subsidize everyone else, while those who wait can buy their epics for cheaper and cheaper.  Everyone walks out with AT LEAST a little cash in their pocket.  Toss in a few rules as far as no-trolling for things like bidding on something that doesn’t benefit you or the MT gets priority on tank gear.  
---
What could go wrong with this?
---
WPvP declined when BGs came out - take off your rose-colored glasses.
---
I just saved my lunch money for a week and bought a game card.
---
I'm taking a harsh stand here because gaming right now is a cesspool. After all the bullshit games these AAA devs put out there's still going to be the idiot minority who push for things like "release dates." The game will release when it's done. Stop trying to push things being done quicker. You automatically take sides with publishers (EA, Activision, etc) when you do this shit. Get mad for calling this shit out, I don't care. I've been a gamer all my life, it's what I love. 
---
Exactly 
---
The gnome female battlecries were the most god damned adorable thing. 
---
As mentioned, DW only available at 20. Then, your miss rate is pretty significant. Also, in your 30s you get WW axe so that will be better than whatever DW combo you get.
---
But, for many people 2h is very boring with the long swing (a miss/dodge/parry can be very nerve wracking), so they like the consistency of DW. So even if it's not more powerful than 2h, people will prefer DW
---
well the most time saving thing you can do is to multi box at launch. If you are wiling to spend some doe on another account. Then you can also start leveling profession when you are leveling your main simultaneously. 
---
Thanks you very much
---
I hope they do this because this is a very divisive issue.  I personally want around 7.5k pop cap but would feel really bad being forced to play on a 2.5k server.
---
Dwarf stone form is useful in both and got axes bonuses.  Remove /immune poison is really good.  
---
It was released along side bgs, sure they where a part of it but dhks was a massive deterrent to city raids. Rose colored glasses doesn’t work here did you mean hindsight bias?
---
I'm just trying to theorycraft a maximum, and then play around with it. I'd expect maybe 3-5 mobs at a time with tank pet / face tank / fears. If there's an easy answer - say lock DS start and priest swp start at the same time (maybe a ping in voice chat or the like) - I'd feel dumb if I didn't at least ask!
---
[Y'all got any more of them classic updates?](https://i.imgur.com/QBo25RH.jpg)
---
On my server back then all the rank14/13/12/11/10 on the horde were all on the same 2 guild wich one of them being the élite club of the other
---
Wife wasn't interested at all in classic until a few weeks ago hearing our old time friends and I talking about old memories. Now she's hardcore meta gaming professions on alts....locations to sit warlocks for summoning...etc. She's pushing scary levels of planning. I couldn't be happier.
---
Take your upvote. This hit me in the feels, one of the greatest films ever with the greatest game ever.
---
Pretty sure axe bonus is orc
---
Back in Vanilla most Warriors were doing well with a 31/5/15 for raid and PVP.
---
Only MT1 was required to be deep prot.
---
prob more than 24 tbh, add a few hundred gold onto that
---
Feel bad for me
---
Doing that further dooms those left behind.  Not everyone is savvy enough to know to transfer.  They will just be left with a deserted game that they will then leave.
---
too much risk to have multiple accounts banned just because someone was to lazy to level a crafting slave
---
I stand corrected 
---
https://classic-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Dwarf_(playable)
---
Give me a 30 warrior on any server and ill prove it
---
Don't sell her the game, sell her the experience. At the end of the day the thoughts of some of the brain dead grinding in classic is a huge turn off to even me who's excited for the game. I'm not looking forward to naxx progression farming at all. Not even a little. The leveling time? Sounds gross. But the experience? The memories? The world being alive? Now that's that good stuff. That's the selling point.
---
This is a great point.  Just always using testing exp probably can save a ton of time.
---
What was the server cap in Vanilla? It seems that the very large pop Vanilla servers is a good target to shoot for. You may want to allow more than that at first to compensate for loss of population over the following 6 - 12 months.
---
I'm thinking that is in the 3-5k population range?
---
It's much better to have a few too many people than to have a dead server with not enough people to run dungeons, quests, PvP, etc..
---
I'm always rolling a new character to harvest some nostalgia, it works less and less.
---
Durotar is the big gay.
---
Troll Island and the crag quests are such cancer.
---
i think i repressed this memory, but im sure i had a similar problem

One owl is bored the other is interested it’s not that deep fam
---
This is actually legit advice, I am surprise. 
---
The difference in retail and vanilla loot itemization is the freedom of choice. In classic you can go to the next level and learn what the stats do and what is it that you need for your character. Sometimes blue and green items are better than your epics. In many cases the amount effort correlates directly to your characters power. 
---
In retail you have very little to choose from; Equip the highest item level you have and you are good to go. In retail you are flooded with loot, but only small amount of it is any good, because it needs titanforging procs and secondary procs. In retail you are buying lottery tickets and hoping that you hit even the consolation prize, but in vanilla you can just work extra to get the reward. Low drop rate items in vanilla can screw you over because random, but in retail you are fighting the RNG with every single drop. If you want a 15% drop chance item in vanilla you will get it, but hoping for good titanforging rolls with chances less than 0.1% is not very fun.
---
I like not having any data cables used really cleans your case up but yeh they aren’t some massive leap in speed. 
---
Some shamans are put into melee groups for windfury, yes but early in progression when no one has great mp5, mama tide is amazing for pve. I'm sure out of the 6-7 shamans a raid will take, there'll be a few without manatide but you'll be humping the raid to take anymore shamans without manatide.
---
There's also a thing where you get switched to a caster group, drop mana tide and then get switched back to the melee group for windfury. Repeat when manatide off cooldown. 
---
No you don't need Pugs. What you need is a guild of like minded players that can raid on a casual schedule. You can tell your wife to not disturb you for 2 hours and get way more things done in the game than pug group would assist you with
---
Like I said. Can’t use private servers like that. Did you even play vanilla back in the day? 
---
You would not make anywhere close to 40g an hour doing this as a priest. 
---
Name fits.
---
Haha great arguement, certainly proves you know what you are talking about.
---
I didn't even say it was a good or a bad thing. You are so insecure.
---
Found the wealthy kid!
---
Why would they exclude one server type all together? In my eyes this is like asking that they put rare items in to the game (=it is given). Of course I could be wrong and it would be sad, but by this logic, shouldn't we be just as worried for normal and pvp servers too since they are server types too?
---
I like to see how many people know the names of the actual starting zones without looking it up.  
---
My favorite is Northshire Valley.
---
From my experience in retail vanilla high pop = bad, no fun, horrible lag, too many people to do anything productive.  I would probably have the exact same view today if I never played on the extremely high pop pserver.  My view has completely changed, more people is better.  
---
Delete this nephew
---
Hope not.
---
WSG will pop with 6 people on each side. If you have to wait 3 hours for 6 people on the entire other faction to queue or your ratio is that fucked up somehow your server should be considered fundamentally broken and corrected. 
---
Should cross realm really be implemented for convenience sake? If we're going to do that, can't we just implement cross realm dungeons as well so people aren't waiting 3 hours to find a tank? Would people be on board adding in obviously negative features if they were snuck in in the final patch? If flying were 1.12 would we want that back? If LFR or LFD were 1.12 would we want that back? 
---
This guy is the first one to get released, and this whole sequence is about his struggle reintegrating with the world.  I believe the narration is Morgan Freeman reading his last letter out to everyone still in prison.

I have no idea what server cap vanilla had, but that would be my vote.

I just upgraded to a samsun evo 860 500gb for my OS and a 1tb m.2 for mass storage....my work computer makes me pull out my hairs on how slow it is now
---
I don't care about exclusivity. I want that white raptor for how it looks, damnit. I remember first seeing that thing in Sen'jin Village, and saying "I will ride you one day." And my slow leveling noob ass did the get to it in time. Come back to me, Vanilla.
---
Could someone point me in the direction of a horde 2h fury guide? Do they go imp slam? Do you spam hamstring for windfury procs? How does it compare to dual wield and when should you switch. I just can't find a good conclusive guide.

Their whole disgusting race is like a curse!

Savages!  Savages!  Cow people to the core!

They have 10% more HP, which means they must be evil!

We must sound the drums of war!

Boo at Durotar being last. I absolutely love that area
---
Can you imagine the response to an RP wedding where the bride is a gnome?
---
I’m kind of looking forward to using the AH. Buying low, selling high, farming things I know can make a decent profit etc.  That and twinking for BGs 
---
You’ll be home soon
---
It's so annoying how people consistently exaggerate gold farming rates on this sub. 25-30g is a more accurate rate of what you should expect to make as a non raid geared 60 before dm launches. 
---
There's two competing teams on two separate empty servers. Both teams are priest/lock duo. One team thinks about this strategy and if possible uses it. The other does not. Which one gets to 60 first? This is theorycrafting. I know it's already good - I want to know if it's possible to be better. I recognize that it's ridiculous, but if it saves a duo some time through the entirety of 1-60 I'm interested.
---
It’s actually pretty cool. BMs in legion got an Artifact weapon that gave them Hati. A magic titan dog. It would walk around and mirror your main pet in attacks and shit. People loved Hati so much that people demanded that we keep Hati and the play style. Wasn’t just Hati either the other Sentient weapons were requested to return; The old God Dagger “Knaifu”, Thal’Kiel a severed Eredar head flying around, and an Arcane staff obsessed with power. Those artifact weapons were my favorite things about legion.
---
Also they constantly glitch, Hati allowing you to get a 3 story tall dinosaur running around Dalaran. 
---
Climbing mountains. There are tons of spots in the game where you can climb atop the completely barren, poorly textured mountain ranges that separate the zones, and I always loved finding that obscure path up there, that only worked by jumping between various precarious "flat" spots in the world geometry, often requiring a mount.
---
Let's just say that lost its charm when Cataclysm made flying universal. The feeling of isolation and accomplishment is somewhat shallower when any dude with a griffon could trivially fly there.
---
5k is good. But 8k is just such a sight to see that I kind of want that. I love seeing org PACKED. 
---
Most of us wants a complete and perfect game, I included. But they have already said "Summer is coming", and I belive they can gives us an update that tells us if they are on schedule or a time frame even. I'm not saying we should push them to publish an unfinished product, but since they already said summer, how much could they change that would effect the game so much that a more spesific release date will hurt? I mean, a mini update for a change or a patch fixing something can't be the end of the world for us if they need a week or three to realise? That's a part of the vanilla feeling right there 
---
And after you get the tiger pelts and kill zalazane, just die and rez at the sen'jin GY. No rez sickness at level 8. Save 5 minutes of running/swimming.
---
You can’t both proc it, but VW could steal last hit too.
---
Same here, friend. Such a wonderful film.
---
Same for stardew Valley and undertale. Basically just word of mouth
---
If you’re fighting rag and master loot isn’t set, you deserve whatever happens to the loot.
---
Thank you for the detailed answer!
---
Yep, #1 Tirisfal, #2 Mulgore. I voted Mulgore because I knew it would be lower and need the help.
---
Not alone
---
Loot trading will only be in instances with a raid lock. If you're in any of them without master looter, that's on you.
---
I don't see much need for loot trading in classic, but you're being dramatic.
---
The team who wants to enjoy their experience vs the team that wants to enjoy their experience.
---
8K+ consistently is amazing. I honestly feel like anything less than 5k will be a dud.
---
Well there isn't really any alternative to practicing leveling routes besides private servers ... at best you can theory craft off the internet but it is not the same as seeing it in game even if values are off.
---
I've heard historically 2.5k or 3k with a Max of near 4k or something...
---
I think 5k would be a good balance though, always have a pretty healthy amount of people on at all times but still small enough to recognize people within cities. 
---
I played in Vanilla, but never really knew the pop cap at the time. I played on Bleeding Hollow which was a High Pop server and it always seemed pretty lively, not absurd though.
---
Nice thank you.
---
Group loot is almost never used in a raid setting. If it is, you're doing it wrong.
---
Had to boil water to take a warm bath a few times, multiple months of sleeping with no electricity. Was the exact opposite. Parents just put us kids first
---
I'm really looking for hints of sarcasm or trolling here but I can't seem to find them.
---
You won't pug and kill Ragnaros. At least it won't be the typical pug. More like 20 good players carrying other 20. And in that case there will be loot master and reservation for the best items.
---
I was not aware of this, thanks!
---
what?
---
Tips had a good video on it, there are real examples of people being autobanned maliciously
---
Yeah but that's a different issue. You need to keep the transfers up and communicate it in game that "hey, your realm is dead, wanna move over to this one?". Maybe people will stay anyway but if they at least know that they can move if they want to then that's all you need.
---
Don’t play

Ganking lowbies.

---
Heirlooms destroyed low level content.   
---
I was able to thrive playing as a 70 twink and reliving the old days just through the sense of community that bracket had.
---
That's all gone now, I have an active subscription going but I don't know why I even bother paying for it anymore. I log in for maybe a few hours every other week. Tried to get into PvP at endgame, but holy paladins just don't feel like I remember, and I don't have the heirlooms to level a new character through the slower parts of the game.
---
People used to ask me what there was to do in the game at end level, and I'd have answers for them. Now there's even more answers, but when I ask myself that same question, it all just feels so hollow.
---
Good call. This will help my shaman. 
---
Don't understand people like you. Come in and condescendingly share your completely useless and false opinion with 0 arguments. Then when you are called out instead of responding with an argument or admitting that maybe there is a chance that you are wrong, you respond with some tripe like "yikes". Pathetic.
---
Kingshit
---
This is one of the greatest things ever
---
No changes retail player cap of 2.5k-4k only
---
That would cause serious damage to the game, leaving servers half empty. It's not an okay solution, that's why they planned it in the first place
---
I'm pretty certain it was already pointed out under such discussions that PServers often have boosted XP rates, because nobody really knows for sure what these rates were at the time, as Thotbot/Wowhead/etc all give different values. The XP Joana gets from the same quests in his old Vanilla Vids was sometimes 25% lesser than what he got on PServers. Leveling from 58 to 60 in Vanilla was legit 90% grinding, because there simply weren't any quests.
---
Sure he might have improved his record by a sensible amount because of better pathing, addons, etc, but the World Records depend on many other factors, like rested time, issues with Questing because of overcrowded zones, or Ganking, so it's not a very precise and serious number anyway.
---
I hadn't thought about that, thanks!
---
Lvl 5 me did that in dun morough, fell, got sent to gy in searing gorge... and hearthstone was on full hour cooldown
---
I have a feeling Blizzard is going to tread very carefully on what's said on April 1st. It's been a rough year for them.

Most players don’t prefer human. 
---
They might be the most popular race, but you have to add all the other races together. Only a minority of players are playing human. 
---
The game has gone down hill Since TBC, Even wrath was terrible though id much prefer "An endless sequence of action cut scenes" than " Muhahaha i am Saturday Disney villain Arthas " with his I'll get you next time and if it wasn't for those meddling Adventurers.
---
That kind of system is really common in pugs these days and works well for that. 
---
It's Brooks until the end, where it picks up with Morgan reading the letter.

He even says he doesn’t know for sure in it.
---
Hawking has more credibility than this guy until he can prove it.
---
Outstanding
---
Currently in a pserver:
---
Blackrock depths, Blackrock mountains, UBRS, LBRS, Molten Core, BWL.
---
The whole aspect of having one big mountain with a long war going inside between top and bottom and having multiple instances each with its own lore and stuff is fascinating to me.
---
On classic:
---
Leveling up and gearing up together with a server.
---
In MMO's I always miss out on server releases and rarely get to experience forming a raid group or a guild. I'm mostly joining when people are already raiding, like currently in a pserver.
---
Look I just feel bad for you and didn't want to make it any worse by making you look even more silly. Anyway good luck with all that
---
You're talking about a few people who have ultimate BiS once AQ40 or naxx are out... That isn't the vast majority of game time
---
Should we change the game of football just cos if we happen to run into Ronaldo at McDonald's and he offers to destroy us in a kickabout?  Don't be silly 
---
It does my old heart good
---
I picked 5k just because it was closer to 4k and more than 3k but I suppose I should've picked "other" instead. I prefer a population range between 3-5k.
---
The common belief is that \~3k was the vanilla server cap before hardware issues appeared, maybe as high as 4k, and consequently the game was balanced and tweaked around such a level cap. You really can't overcome this without adding hard changes such as dynamic respawns.
---
Testing a few pservers out, the leveling rush on a \~5k server still felt reasonably authentic to the original experience, only grouping was more abundant than I remember from back in vanilla. This might be too inauthentic for some, especially because it had dynamic respawns to accommodate.
---
Going off some things they did in the past, it'll probably just be a blue post that lists "changes" being made to classic. Like some random funny shut they're doing to pallys and shamans to balance them. Stating how they will use the original troll female models. And changing the way pvp system works to make it more "fair." It'll send the #nochanges people into a blind furry while the rest of us just crack a beer and lawl.
---
Nothing says commuity like ignoring everyone and farming the one rapidly respawning mob
---
Bit of both. The loot was often very good on the spawned mobs, and the epic ness was high, so people didn’t just pvp spam. Certainly did happen tho, especially if you saw that guy from last week or an old STV enemy or that guild etc
---
Also People forget that drop rates for quests on some servers are vastly different than vanilla was. 
---
...we do know what they did. we found out several years ago. i am talking about what they did in TBC.
---
model just looks good. only model i think looks nice is b11
---
Beautiful

Why in the world would you choose to put your OS on your regular SSD instead of your m2?
---
Its takes so fucking long and with the slow looking Tauren walking animation that zone is just tilting me.
---
Exact same feeling I had when trying retail during legion after only having played vanilla. I didn't understand the world anymore. What is all this crap filling up my slots. Is it useful? Why is everyone flying around but nobody is talking to anyone?
---
Took a portal to some place from some a previous expansion where nobody goes anymore and just wandered around like an explorer in an abandoned amusement park. Thinking of what might have transpired there. Was a weird experience.
---
this is the best post i've seen in a while, if i had coins i would give you an award. seriously man well done
---
Assume both teams want to be as fast and efficient as humanly possible and finds their enjoyment through that. Assume the question posted was a mechanics one and not a "who would have the most fun based on your opinion of fun?"
---
15 years of WoW and you have never played it?  That's a feat in and of itself.  With that being said, if you tried WoW as it stands in its current form, and then made the transition to Classic at launch, I just feel like it would leave you utterly confused.  They're essentially two different games at this point.  Retail is a streamlined, simplified, on-rails themepark type of game, where you're funneled down very specific avenues in the story.  It's the old WoW spruced up with new textures and models, flashy spell effects and faster combat.
---
Vanilla WoW is a much more immersive experience, with a perfect mix of themepark and sandbox elements.  There's no main story arc they force you down, but there are several awesome and iconic questlines that you can pick and choose at your leisure.  Leveling is much more difficult and time-consuming in Classic WoW, which is something that a lot of veterans to the game really enjoy.  While slower-paced, creatures generally hit much harder, have more hit-points, and at the same time you receive more damage while doing less.  There's a lot more downtime in Vanilla, meaning when you die, you're forced to run back to your corpse as a ghost, starting from the graveyard.  In Vanilla, zones had far fewer graveyards, and you died more often, so the dreaded Vanilla "corpse run" can consume a lot of your time.  Quests and monsters also give less XP than retail, so leveling is much slower.  
---
Retail has QoL improvements to make things faster and more casual friendly.  You can click a button, and after a short time, be teleported to a dungeon with a full group.  In Vanilla you had to utilize the game's various chat channels, assemble your group via advertising and whispers, and physically walk your character to the dungeon.
---
Retail has items called "heirlooms" that you can equip to increase your XP gain, sometimes being able to accrue XP 50% faster.  With the inflated xp rates, you can level absurdly fast.
---
Vanilla has no such heirlooms, and no items to increase XP.
---
Retail has achievements, trophies, a battle pet system, a raid finder, more races, more classes, more quests, zones, and items.
---
Vanilla has comparatively much less content, but there's many people, Vanilla players and Retail players alike, that think Vanilla genuinely has more things to do.  It has a charm, character, and ambiance that retail can't even touch.  
---
In my personally opinion, I would advise you to wait for Classic.  If you play Retail now and like it, get used to its conveniences, and then try Classic, you're probably going to hate it.  On the other hand, if you play Classic first and consider it slow or boring, you can just try retail instead.
---
oh my bad, i totally misread what you said. i don't think they could cause too much damage with wc3 remaster though. they might turn akama to a broken.
---
He will talk about this as if he knew how this worked back in Vanilla when he didn't even played at the time.
---
Low pop cap = more servers = more upkeep costs = no-no from Blizzard
---
Anyone else see it this way?
---
I have to agree.
---
I played alliance for 15yrs but UD got the best classic starting zone.
---
Best starting zone overall though. Gotta be Deathknights. But that's not really fair.
---
Just raiding in general, I never raided in vanilla. In fact I never did Dire Maul, LBRS or UBRS either, so all of those.
---
Proctologist is a 12 letter word. You can still be an anal doctor :)
---
You're not a warrior, rogue, paladin, priest, mage or warlock either. Well, maybe you are a priest... 
---
Probably the team that sacrificed their want of playing a particular class in favor of speed, leaving them in a class they don't want to play.
---
Aff is definitely the go to for leveling. Then you hit 60 and swap.
---
You've got that setup backwards.
---
Get mental help kid, for your own sake.
---
This is what led to “ninjas” back in the day. Yes you could do this(though not in a raid setting as others have pointed out) but you will be labeled a ninja and ruin your reputation which will be important as there will be no cross realm dungeons/raids or LFR/LFD.
---
I would 100%, b/c I wasn't able to afford it then.  I can now though.  :P
---
Wow this is amazing
---
people dungeon boost from 1-35 in less than 6 hours. Your time is nothing to brag about.
---
8k is a fun novelty, I found it really enjoyable seeing other players even at far-flung quest hubs.
---
However, the leveling experience was outrageously inauthentic, and that's an important thing to preserve for a lot of us which is why some of us don't want to see huge server caps.
---
I enjoyed the highly populated world and ease of finding leveling partners. I did not so much enjoy being the third full 5-man group waiting in line for a 10+ minute respawn well after launch hype subsides. The latter detracted significantly from the experience in my opinion, even with dynamic spawns.
---
At some point during the trailer you see a battle between orcs and humans. There is a knight unit fairly close to an orc towerl
---
Dwarves don't give me any benefit as a paladin and I can't be a Gnomadin.
---
....it's almost like it's an RPG
---
What I’m saying is that the PvP playerbase should have been ignored. Anyone who felt raiding was hours of boring content was playing the wrong game. The devs tried to make WoW accessible to people that had no interest playing a MMORPG.
---
Sounds like it's time to find a new job...
---
Hmm, that's a good question. Buy a ticket, get a percentage chance, buy five tickets, get a higher percentage chance - with a massively expensive epic in the running. You'd eventually accrue more gold in total than the price of the epic, more than likely. But... is it illegal??
---
Was a pain in the ass convincing my dad every month
---
I saw teebu blazing longsword drop in UBRS, I didn't win the roll though :(
---
Dwarf stoneform helps a bit vs hunters
---
Riding at level 30.
---
I wouldn't want riding to come too early. Crawling through the world for dozens of hours makes finally getting a mount much more rewarding.
---
However, at level 40 I think it's a little to late. It's about the half-way point, /played-wise, and I think the rewarding effect could be had much earlier. At level 30, unlike level 20, you've already sunk quite a bit of time into a character, and more and more dungeons begin to pop up, so I think that would be a nice point.
---
Yes that would be a good first step for you
---
Things can get better, promise
---
Sounds like it has been a meme since before you know WoW existed.
---
my biggest worries are what they'll do with kael and illidan. i think everything else will probably be okay/i would be fine with turning akama into a broken
---
I will NEVER understand this answer. The 'humans' in this franchise, or most others for that matter, might aswell be a completely different race because you have about as much in common with them as you do a Tauren other than looks. 
---
Make world of Warcraft greAt again 
---
they are doing so many right things currently. i dont believe they fuck it up by implementing micro transactions
---
Amazing
---
What is the definition of a death threat though? Is someone saying ,"kys" counted the same as someone posting your address as a threat? Kys is definitely a thrashy thing to say but I would never lose sleep over it.
---
As one of these people who prefers humans to the other races (in a lot of games, not just wow), it usually boils down to thinking the armor looks best on them.
---
It's that simple.
---
I think they should, and I think they should also use bags for the slots same as personal banks to help the economy and it should be very expensive to get tabs.
---
It should be a guild effort to afford a bank and account sharing for banking and ranking should be cracked down on.
---
Yes I always calculate with about 25g/h conservatively. You increase it by factors of 2-3 the more gold and materials you can store to use the AH and if you farm the right stuff at the right time.
---
Tag Bg from anywhere in Azeroth (not in a instance). 
---
Auto leave queue when joining a bg. 
---
New raids and instances 20/40 without more powerful gears than t3. 
---
Nerf gold farming from instance. 
---
Yeah it could all be a non issue since the two systems were so spread out, but it's good to bring to light some of the issues that could come up if they chose to close that gap, or if they decided to run with the 1.12 pricing since that's the patch they chose as their foundation. I think they are starting to see some of the problems with choosing a later game state that had a lot of systems built in to prepare for the transition to their BC systems.
---
Me: Boy, another $15 bucks from my bank account for 30 more days of WoW!  
---
Friends: Ha, you idiot, what a waste of money.  
---
Also my friends: IT'S THE WEEKEND TIME TO SPEND $250 ON BAR TABS!  
---
Me: You spend $1,000 a month at bars?  
---
Friends: Shut up idiot, go play your computer game.  
---
Also my friends: Hey dude, can I borrow some money for rent this month? I'm a little short right now.  
---
It depends if they’re going to do cross-server PVP, which I hope they don’t. If they don’t then yea not only do we need a high population but also they need controls to dictate horde vs alliance balance. 
---
agreed but then you have to worry about 30% of the population being able to freely trinket your only real cc, and it hurts priests much more because of its cd and another 30% of the pop which can resist your blackout proccs about 1/3 of the time.
---
One of the main reasons people pick human really has nothing to do with the lore surrounding the races, but because they have the weapon skill racial bonuses to sword and mace. 
---
In terms of atmosphere I'd say teldrsssil but I didn't like many of the cave quests there that seemed endless.
---
In terms of layout and atmosphere I think dun morogh wins. It's beautiful and cozy and the quests are easy to blow through. 
---
#NoChanges
---
Definitely 2H as soon as possible, unless you happen to somehow get two significantly better 1hers than a 2her the 2h will have more damage output. Staying 2H arms the whole way through isn't bad at all, you get some nice talents for early on to help level like improved rend for kiting with some parry as well as tactical mastery for switching stances. Then you get sweeping strikes at 30 to pair with cleave. 
---
Did I say it isn't? He said Vanilla is more accessible, which is a blatant lie.
---
It's still a game though and you're supposed to get enjoyment out of it. OP would probably rather run through quests than mindlessly grind gold for hours. Bonus points if they convert to a 39 lvl twink. 
---
The Nostaliga, man.
---
Simple. Dwarves and gnomes are short, while night elves are skinny. If I’m gonna be a mighty character I’m going with the biggest size. 
---
Wow thanks for the plethora of info man! Appreciate it. 
---
I don't see the problem with that scenario. If you are somehow in a raid that kills Ragnaros with Group Loot enabled, and there are people around who have half an epic mount as spending money, have at it.
---
Good explanation and break down
---
Yea, I figured I’d go Herb, though I’ve also read I should go engineering to do solo tribute runs? So it makes things a bit awkward.
---
This is art. Take my silver, you’ve earned it! 
---
What are you thinking they might do?
---
I dont think they will do anything too dramatic, because of how much plothole gravel they had to put down for Legion + the Illidan novel. 
---
If you're going to mince words and get pedantic about it, then EVERY race is played by a minority of players.
---
Man I feel this super hard. I quit WoW and started playing tabletop DnD. I’d highly recommend it to anyone that can put a group of friends together to play that’s never tried it. The start set is like $20 and it’s extremely easy to get into. 
---
I’ve been playing a lot of Project 1999 waiting for WoW classic as well.
---
Here's my attempt:
---
Tirisfall Glades - Deathknell
---
Mulgore - Red Cloud Mesa
---
Durotar - Valley of Trials
---
Dun Morogh - Umm... Cold something Valley
---
Elwynn Forest - Umm... Generic Fantasy Land?

&gt; they need controls to dictate horde vs alliance balance.
---
I think they need this either way on the PvP servers at least to keep world PvP decently balanced. As long as it doesn't get super out of control and one faction massively outnumbers the rest, it should still be fun.
---
That's considering your MT is always showing up for the raid and you're doing T1-T2 content at a *slow* pace.
---
Tank spec + gear is the most limiting factor for raiding because you are both increasing your Healer's efficiency and your threat cap for DPS. If you are tanking stuff with 31/5/15 both of that will be low, meaning you are basically shifting the burden to your healers to buy more consumables and to the raid as a whole.
---
But yes you can get away with it. The question is if you want to put yourself first or the guild.
---
Remember, ur the starship enterprise.  Shields up, pew pew!
---
I’m thinking of it like this. Get my main to 30, make an alt and level to 12 in one session. Build rested do while continuing to level main. 12-20 is another 10 hours, but I’ll probably do it in short bursts while continuing to level my main, an hour or two here and there. One main is 60, it’s full speed ahead with my alt. Get the alt to level 35, then start another alt in a similar fashion. As soon as my first alt hits 35, I get alchemy high enough to make arcanite.

Go 2h fury. That miss rate when dual wielding is brutal. Also a big 2h paired with hamstring kiting is ideal.
---
I honestly don't think it will affect that many people, aside from a handful of hardcore rankers. When I was taking part in a raid inside an enemy's town, it just didn't matter if I got a few DKs along the way. 
---
A solution for those rankers might be to just wait for a couple months until after they have achieved their ranking goal to resume raids on enemy cities, if collecting a couple DKs is such an earth-shatteringly big deal.
---
God no. Just no. 
---
Also not sure what resilience has to do with horde alliance ratio. 
---
The problem is that you really never get to kill mobs in such high numbers without stopping. In theory if there were an unlimited supply of mobs lined up then the duo with the most efficient mana regen and zero downtime would gain more xp/hour. 
---
But in reality you will kill like 10 mobs and either have to leave to turn in a quest or wait for mobs to respawn. 
---
Fantastic captions, fantastic movie, fantastic scene!  Well done!
---
Same thing happened to me. Sad times lol
---
It has nothing to do with owl body language. OP is anthropomorphising the owls by giving them human-like traits that we can all relate to. 
---
Yeah, there’s not a mailbox in all of Azshara. 
---
idk, keep in mind buildings were never to scale in WC3. I think what you're talking about is more about the perspective when zoom in all the way. it looks good if its top down
---
In order of importance, first one being the most important to me
---
Magic resistance and hit chance calculations, particulally in PvP (currently a player few levels below has zero chance against higher one, biggest BS in pvp)
---
Removal of most world buffs and consumables in PvE raids. I want to raid, not farm for gold.
---
Warriors being the only tanks in raid (tiny-tiny buff to bears, major one for shamans and paladins)
---
Removal of DHKs (never hurt me personally, I'm just basing this on comments and posts and my own logic) Turn quest NPCs unattackable instead, or have fast respawn for them.
---
Creepy whispers are the only downside
---
give me classic or give me death
---
This is the best thing so far in Vanilla, made my day. Thank you
---
Hey, just wanted to ask you if armor is good in vanilla and why? Just the other day I heard someone say that armor isn't worth it
---
Id like to say 3k but the low end of it sucks too much
---
Because most people can connect with their avatar better if it looks like them or the very least if its something they want to look like. 
---
Not gonna argue that any of that is untrue. I recommended he not play one because that pay off takes a long time to get to. Not because the pay off isn't their. My only criticism of Ele is not that it's bad. It's that if you don't want to heal, you should not play one. The reason being that without the god gear. Ele is pretty unplayable. That being said once you do get that gear. I do agree it is a very scary class.
---
The opposite is true. I say that from experience of retail vanilla and current vanilla. Classic wont be much different. Also look for guild threads in these forums, the vast majority are casual friendly and individualistic (no restrictions on players).
---
I played a custom map of WC2 earlier as humans.
---
It works quite well. I didn't have any issues beyond a slight roughly 10 second sound stutter. But that might as well have been my audio drivers being crazy.
---
Can't say anything about WC1. Haven't tried yet. 
---
Reminded me of that hilarious shaman guide for some reason :
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukyR2uJgv\_A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukyR2uJgv_A)
---
I only like human and nightelf. I prefer nightelf. I connect with them. Im not into RP much though. I would also choose either orc or UD as horde. I do create a code for my characters based on their race and class but that’s about it. I like nightelf because of their aesthetics, their zone and that they connect to nature. I like humans for their versatility.
---
I do like horde for its aggressiveness and play way more aggressive as horde. I don’t know but it feels right.
---
What this guy said. 
---
How something be so hilarious and depressing at the same time, i'll never know.
---
I totally agree with the points you make, and they make sense. However, the point of making this post was more geared to the fact that after completing a given raid can be quite disappointing knowing that anybody can get a better item just buy farming gold and buying a BoE / crafted item for example. Yes, I understand there is a satisfaction in actually completing the raid, but that is separate from the idea of , complete difficult dungeon == reap reward of great loot, that only people who have completed the dungeon can ascend to that level of gear. Which is completely negated by people who may have less skill but spend hours grinding gold instead. 
---
The benefit is this, by increasing the serverwide arcanite/player, you make it easier to get things like Lionheart Helm, Thunderfury, Sulfuras, etc. Sure, other people could make it, but I want to help them and myself get gear by increasing the number of transmutes. 
---
I got a WD Green for that reason. Turns off when its not used.
---
I disagree. Every single time a game is given a release date, communities go into a rage if the product needs to be pushed back. Then YouTubers blow shit up, and Twitter becomes a warzone. Stocks fall, and shareholders demand a quicker release. Product is released with shit content or a broken mess. It's a chain we see again and again and again and we don't fucking learn.
---
Are you looking for leveling or level 60 guide? If you're looking for leveling, definitely check out the just pure arms build, a lot more consistent leveling.

Yes, it really makes my day when my leveling character gets a Dragonslayer or a ZG buff. 
---
It's also pretty fun to get to felwood with a dragonslayer, pop a songflower, drink a mongoose and crit away against questing mobs.
---
That doesn't change the fact that you can sell the loot and will get whisper from people who wanna buy in pugs.
---
We need more people to put out prot leveling guides. It can be a really good spec if your server is low on tanks. Being in demand for instance groups helps a ton.
---
People keep talking fury, but with arms you get the extra dmg from kiting things with rend / deep wounds / impale + Tact mastery and anger management
---
Low-level pvp shitshows and corpse camping
---
i dont think you understand the word "cap" xd
---
Ah, so you were only the wealthy kid at the lunch table!
---
I remember one time I had two Monster energy drinks sealed. Man, I felt rich. era 2005
---
I recommend you look for some DPS warrior guides to give you a good overview. You're going to spec as a typical fury, means you go deep into Fury and get Arms talents that improve your crit scaling. Alternatively you can also put talents into Prot if you want to off-tank a ton for the increased threat and some mitigation but that is quite niche.
---
Regarding to gearing and talents you will be the best to actually make these decisions. Guides and tips are just there to give you a direction but your experience will differ from others and you will adapt accordingly with your gear and your spec.
---
Nah 60 raiding 
---
I ranked to 11 and full exalted bgs in vanilla and the only thing like this i remember seeing is charging a mage and successfully charging but getting sheeted anyway, and maybe seeing an occasional double sheep.
---
Racials won't make or break you. Seriously, just pick whatever you like the looks of best. If you insist on min/maxing and playing alliance, gnome or dwarf would be best for pvp, human for fury pve, and NE for tanking. I'm in the same boat you are, and I'll be playing human because I like the looks of them best. I can't imagine playing a gnome warrior. 
---
This really hits home. I logged back into wow after a 5 year hiatus. It was such a shock at how much the game has changed and dumbed down. After 3 months of playing, I remembered why I left wow before and left again.
---
sharding doesnt solve this problem unless caps are well above 3k
---
Take all of my upvote. 
---
I dont know how its going to work in classic. Since the new engine has much smoother mechanics I'm really not sure if it will work the way it does on private servers. 
---
I know it was just the demo during blizzcon but while I was trying to do it, I felt like the mobs were a little faster or picked better paths to chase me which lead to them still hitting me while my swing timer recharged. Itll be interesting to see for sure. 
---
Might’ve been. We’ll have to wait and see. Mind you, WC3 was never my favorite (although the story is great). I’m more of a WC2 kind of guy.
---
1000x agree to this without a doubt. Just trying to discuss. 
---
lamest troll attempt ever
---
My question was sincere.
---
Although I was more thinking about Blackrock Mountain or maybe AQ. Probably showing my Horde bias.
---
Up until Molten Core you'll be fine. Even in MC if you have the gear to help with mitigation you should be fine as Arms tanking.

---
Most races are pretty firm in their general stance and depiction (kind of boring), humans are diverse. At least the War 3 and Vanilla Humans, not the retail *limitless potential goodie good*- Humans. 
---
Back then I also thought it was fascinating that the first enemies you face in your starting zone are other human factions. Azeroth is an extremely hostile world, but mankind still manages to turn on itself!
---
i will admit that i haven't played a ton of warcraft 3 (i want to be better at it tbh but i just suck at rts games) and mostly just know the bits i've played so far + summaries and such, so if i'm wrong on anything please correct me
---
for kael i kind of fear something like what they did to garrosh. the transition from tbc garrosh to pandaria garrosh was very hamfisted and awkward and in an attempt to make it make sense they just went back and retconned everything about his character that made him interesting (like the fact he was literally mentally ill) so that they could go ACTUALLY, he was a fantasy nazi all along
---
so tldr ''...surprise i was actually evil all along''
---
tbh my worries on illidan are more vague, i guess i don't have any concrete ideas on what they'd do to him but as you mentioned the things they had to do for legion and his novel to make tbc justified is just. awkward. in a way i feel like even though the writing in tbc was bad they should have just moved on from it, so bringing him back and saying all the bad stuff he did was fine because in the end we beat up the legion and harping on his crush on tyrande is just.... ehhh. i'm not a fan. so like i said i don't know what they'd do but if it's anything like the way he was written in legion i feel like it will be. embarrassing.
---
i do agree with you that it probably won't be anything super dramatic and i'm just getting worked up, i just got a little concerned because other people have also been concerned. also, i've got to keep playing warcraft 3 lol
---
I would like to see them integrated into the game. Another comment made a great point about mount/riding cost changes later down the road (in 1.12 I believe). Before that, epic mounts cost 1000g (before any faction discounts). I think there are valid concerns with people buying up the more popular choices at 1.12 mount prices (100g? 200? don't remember) and selling them for a lot more long after they're no longer available.
---
I, personally, would prefer the old mount/riding model where mounts are expensive. The mount cost change was not so people could "collect more mounts" in vanilla, it was an eye toward TBC, additional riding skill levels, and the many new factions and mounts coming in TBC. The old epic mounts would fit in this way, whether they are a time-limited thing or left in to be available forever.
---
I also think that if there will not be new or cycling servers available once in a while that keeping them exclusive is a little silly. I would like newcomers 5 years down the road to be able to experience the content buckets, leveling rush, world events, and yes, chance to buy an unarmored mount in the same reasonably authentic way other classic players did before them. I want the game to have lasting appeal to new players for years to come, and I think this is one of those things that can contribute to that. I've never been a fan of Blizzard cutting content and things-to-do out of the game.
---
A strawman is if I make up an argument for you and argue against that instead of your actual argument. I am just showing you that your argument could be used as justification for any number of changes. I am not claiming you want those changes. In fact, my point is better made the less you want those changes.
---
You are correct that some changes are easier to make than others. I agree with that. But I am sure you can think of many changes that you would not want despite them being easy to make.
---
The crowd that's absolutely holding on to no changes needs to take a look at OSRS and its history, I think.  
---
&gt;more like reminded that spell batching was a thing
---
This is what I'm talking about.  
---
If y'all hired people who care deeply about PvP, no reminder would be necessary.  
---
Ask any PvP Rogue who is old enough to remember about their opinion on changes to Vanish behavior going from WotLK into Cata. Ask them their opinion about the change to batching itself in WoD.
---
PvPers are just disappointed that things which are obvious, key issues to us are apparently not obvious to any of the developers.
---
When tho ML is on, i can say Need and then give to my friend after the raid?
---
I think, with community polls and approval, it's reasonable to add content after patch progression is done. 
---
What makes even more sense is just TBC servers where we have the option to copy our character over
---
Sounds like you will have an owl pet
---
I like that plan. Arcanite is a limiting factor in the early stages of a server.
---
am i going to have a really bad time as a warrior if i don't hamstring kite and get a swing timer and all that stuff? i thought it'd be nice to level one as an alt on the side, but everyone makes it seem like you have to do all of this preparation or it'll just be Heck
---
&gt;for kael i kind of fear something like what they did to garrosh. the transition from tbc garrosh to pandaria garrosh was very hamfisted 
---
I don't think I can agree with that. I thought his arc in WOTLK and Cata made his actions in MoP made sense, as opposed to Kael where it was just too fast. There was an actual arc there.
---
But regardless, I don't think they're going to rewrite the scenario. At the worst, they might add a few lines of dialogue to foreshadow TBC. 
---
everyone is saying if you're raiding on group loot is your problem...I haven't read anywhere that loot trading will only be for group loot and not master loot?? I thought 90% of the argument was when the master looter sent it to the wrong person and then they can trade...in that scenario any pug raid regardless of loot type will be susceptible to back door trading. am I off base here?
---
People named Adolf won't kill you for drawing a picture of Hitler. 
---
Classes don't have "attack reset from skills". Stormstrike doesn't even reset your AA in 1.12, the spell itself is just an extra swing. The only thing that resets your auto attack timer is additional attack procs: Winfury, Sword spec procs and Hand of Justice procs. None of these will be used while levelling by most people. 
---
You act like you'll be rage starved if you hamstring kite despite the fact that 90% of your rage generation comes from your basic attacks. You're acting as if it would be impossible to use abilities while hamstring kiting, and as if the fight would be much shorter if you sit there and take 2x the damage. That's completely false.
---
You trade off a negligible decrease in killspeed for a massive decrease in downtime.
---
You make a very good point about the trinket. I suppose I’m just trying to relate it more to the fact that, it has to feel kind of disappointing to be more or less required as a holy paladin to wear cloth robes, or a warrior wearing leather instead of plate, in order to reach maximum performance. 
---
Again, just to reiterate, I much prefer how the system in vanilla works and enjoy it, just thought it’s an interesting topic to talk about since most people seem to think vanilla is flawless. 
---
Upvoted because of good sense of humor! :D
---
Try both 
---
I'm telling you, man, this is why the troll women are vastly superior to other races!
---
Even though I knew that, now that I see the facts in front of me, I really question if alliance is the right choice here...
---
Add to that wotf will also work against mind control and rogue-specific insignia is kinda nice against priest too(since it removes fear and charm effects, at least it doesn't remove stuns)
---
And I expect a lot of orc/undead rogues.
---
I'm kinda bound to alliance cause of friends. I guess a good thing is that my pala friends can just bop me and allow me to cast right into the face of those melees. :-D
---
I played on Twisting Nether horde. The only memorable thing to this day what how quickly it died. That server was an absolute ghost town, even after the merges. There was like one raiding guild on horde... blitzkrieg iirc? 
---
this again?
---
I always tanked 5mans as holy/prot....  turn on righteous fury and blast heals. If no ones taunting, you will have all the aggro. Concentration aura and talents so you don’t suffer casting pushback. This is later in the game when you outgear everything tho. Pally tank is bad, more of a gimmicky fun thing to try. Once my guild was into Naxx and I had soaked up enough tankadin gear I’d offtank through MC BWL and ZG but again was vastly outgearing the content. Progression pally tank is a Hard NO
---
You could vendor it if you wanted, but the guild will get pissed if they’re giving you loot and then you show up with the same stuff you had last week.  
---
If you’re pugging I don’t give two hooves what you do with it.
---
Drop a like for this awesome Clip.
---
Nobody know for sure but roughly ~3k.
---
This is so easy...
---
Create your own guild.  Then you can play whatever you want and get whatever gear you want.
---
And if you think that's too selfish, think again, because I've seen it so many times in Retail that it's practically the norm.
---
It’s not pedantry when the claim is most players will pick human which OP considers the boring option. Only around 15% of the playerbase will roll human, and pointing that out is relevant to the thread. 
---
in a guild you will probably rub people the wrong way, in a pugged MC or ZG this will probably be a new way to make gold, pass on your upgrade for 300g?
---
i'm not sure i agree? because the most prominent example people have of WOTLK garrosh is when saurfang teaches him about HONOR and all that jazz, and it is apparently a lesson he's taken to heart as he quotes it later on. i won't get into the stonetalon stuff because apparently it was just the biggest miscommunication of all time. personally i saw it as working towards an orc leader who could be more brutal and do more for his people in a time of war/someone who took a lot of pride in the horde, but then suddenly it's just. i'm racist call 911. 
---
people seem pretty split down the middle on if it is or isn't a good build up though and i guess i could see it either way so your opinion is fair tbh
---
but yeah, that's probably what's going to happen/while i wouldn't be a fan it's not going to ruin my enjoyment of the game or anything
---
I think level 30-40 is more reasonable.  We don't want try hard 60s pushing all development towards the end game. 
---
Honestly there isn’t much of the actual blizzard left to save. It’s a sad truth but there it is - the people of talent and integrity have quit over these last many years.
---
https://youtu.be/IhSAJ8aA3PQ?t=615
---
He comments about how he learned about it about 7 months before the blizzcon announcement(Nov 4 2017) and that the team had been working on it for "around a year or so".
---
So it puts the date somewhere around April 2016 which was roughly the same time nost got shut down and the petition stuff was happening.
---
So its anyone's guess as to the real timeline... was nost shutdown because of classic? was classic started because of nost shutdown? who really knows.
---
I think the solution is to just make the re spawns on the civilians something like 30 seconds.  Then they are not immune, and it should limit the grief potential allowing for removal of dishonorable kills.
---
"Westfall makes my ass itch"
---
My problem wasn't the money I'd spend, but rather the time.
---
I'd see it as a waste of money if I wasn't playing as much as possible because not playing pretty much meant that I'm not getting the full value of that $15 dollars. It can be a dangerous system with this kind of mind set.
---
Westfall!
---
Mage is very good at farming which is what Chinese do and Chinese always roll undead if their class allows it
---
BFA and Classic/vanilla are, for all intents and purposes, entirely different games based in the same world. I liken them to Morrowind and Skyrim. They share a setting, but are so far divorced from one-another that  any mature adult can play one without developing expectations for and letting that alter their experience of the other.
---
Jump into BFA. Enjoy it for what it is. Take no expectations from BFA into Classic when it launches, as it's a different game from a different time with a different design philosophy and goal. They really are completely different. Enjoy both for what they are, not what one thinks either of them "should" be.
---
Then it wouldnt be Classic
---
And that's from a solo booster. Someone got boosted by their guildies and hit 60 in 1day21h.
---
me to mom: "TOILETTTT"
---
Well great now I'm crying 
---
gotta love the good ole double down technique when you are wrong! 
---
literally something as simple as a mage using frostbolt only, a good mage will still shine over a bad mage. Hard to invalidate that.
---
To say "I dont understand the logic" is shortsighted. 
---
Server merges are a lot more work for the team. Much harder to automate that sort of thing successfully without a lot of dev intervention. Even if they capped at 3k and didn't have sharding, imagine 800 players in Elwynn RIGHT AT LAUNCH.
---
My guess is that an experience like that is not acceptable for Blizzard. It's also not how the original launch was at all. The midnight launch of Vanilla was rocky, but players were spread out because the playerbase grew rapidly, but steadily over time for many months. This time around, 9AM on a Tuesday is going to be fucking mad.
---
I played all of the big p server launches and had tons of fun with the absurdity of that mass playerbase, barely tagging mobs, memes all over chat... but that is not an experience Blizzard will want to roll out because it is not an authentic experience for Classic.
---
It's not an easy decision. Either they shard the first few zones for the first few weeks and risk people not making friends, or they have to do all sorts of work migrating servers and manually babysitting the population health of all of their realms.
---
Sure, as long as you're fine giving up an epic. If it's a guild run, you're likely not going to be getting another epic for that slot on that raid, and if you're on a DKP system you wont be getting another epic for a while, so... the sacrifice is up to you!
---
tbh, this is why I prefer later expansions. The extremely low loot per person makes it feel unrewarding to me. I'll still enjoy Classic, but its endgame isnt my favorite. 
---
Your first post was downvoted because it was nonsense and false. Your second post was downvoted because of your shitty attitude.
---
Sidenote: I find it really funny how you block people that disagree with you. Gotta love the irony of this comment
---
&gt; LOL man redditors are such delicate snowflakes.
---
but we are on 1.12 so it WILL be the glory days still
---
If your only ever playing with pallies you know that's a great strat, in my experience most of the pug ones, are ret and don't bother trying to help anybody but themselves
---
People here are paranoid.  Retail players will not vote retarded shit into the game in spite of the classic fan base.  Maybe a very small minority would attempt that, but the vast majority of people are evil like that. 
---
You can check my above post for the clip i was referencing, but my point was more that it was entirely possible classic was already on the to-do list and that the nost drama just fast-tracked it rather than the petition being solely responsible for setting everything in motion.
---
Uhh why would Adolf be banned? Isnt it a common name?
---
THAT'S A FUCKING 50 DKP MINUS!!!
---
in a perfect world loot council is objectively the best loot system, however it's almost always corrupted in someway by [t-word]s, cringelords, and attention whores
---
women buying gear with nudes, class leader giving gear to his friends or his [t-word] crush, etc
---
Honestly it was my first character in fall of 06, maybe I just kept at it a long time or beat it with the power of noob lol.
---
The difference is new games feel like they are based on industry analytics and profit algorithms, while classic wows (design) at least wants to stay true to some of the old ways.
---
You get two full sets of t2.5 every AQ40 raid, so it will not take you much longer if you are not tanking :)
---
I really liked this. 
---
Way to ignore every other part of my response. You're significantly underestimating the room for improvement. Again, you reference "known leveling issues". Can you tell me what these are? Quest XP has been fixed on every major server for a while so that's a non-factor.
---
It's a psychological thing, if Martians showed up tomorrow and looked roughly like humans it would go over better than if they looked like C'thun.
---
Loot trading is only in raids. 5 man's won't have it. So if you pug a raid, you risk dealing with this through master looters anyway.
---
Soon™
---
Classic questing is mostly fetch/grind quests, just FYI.
---
However it's nothing but the original vanilla story (which was largely removed from the game in the Cataclysm expansion), without a lot of convoluted extra lore from many years of expansions on top of it. Story-wise, classic offers content, story, and lore players haven't been able to experience in the modern game in *years*, so there's that.
---
Classic is a slower paced, grindier game than BFA. It isn't "harder" like some people purport, but it plays differently, situational awareness is more relevant, you probably won't be mowing down packs of mobs at once while solo leveling, etc.
---
what happens when the server you are on gets merged into a "streamer" server? i know alot of people do not want to play with any streamers on their server at all
---
People would be absolutely furious if they did that. A lot of enthusiasts want to take off work to enjoy the hyped up launch. Apex legends doesnt have to worry about server community + player competition. 
---
My point was that you ask them to tank, regardless if they are ret or holy or prot they can tank everything baring endgame. But most are so locked up in the modern school of "only prot can tank" that they refuse to join unless they dps.
---
Either that or you end up with an uncanny valley effect.
---
Well generally you are talking about concurrent players. Each realm might have 20-25k active players, but only around 3k online at any one time.
---
Max around 4k is my preference. IME that's the tipping point where higher population doesn't feel like the same vanilla experience anymore, it turns into the pserver overcrowded clusterfuck.
---
Title. Sorry about that
---
rule 8 is probably for the best
---
Most of the locks will be on horde because wotf. 
---
haha are you serious? It was designed as a *server* event, the entire point of the gate opening was to have the whole server come to Silithus and experience this together. So no, there's 0 chance Blizzard will try and fame some sort of scenario where the AQ is better with less people, the fact that you think that is quite laughable
---
Won’t have the quest line when vanilla comes out

I bought the unarmored Green Raptor, but there was no way I could make 900G for the Epic Rainbow Raptor.
---
&gt;There were not TV commercials for games I don't think, for what that's worth.
---
There was for D2.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzBp9ECiodc
---
I'm not sure if if WoW got any tv commercials. The earlier commercial WoW got was in 2006/2007, which is kinda weird.
---
You can't understand wanting to play a character that is the closest to yourself? It's not what I do, but man, it's not even a slightly hard concept to grasp.
---
I once wiped us on Firemaw by pulling with Eye of Kilrogg. Forgot it puts everyone in combat...
---
That sinking feeling as you don't drop out of combat after the eye dies...
---
Followed by a dragon bursting through the door and one shotting half the raid. I was not popular that day!
---
The WoW forum community has always been a dumpster fire. People like to pretend otherwise, but they're deluding themselves.
---
In-game people are very different. Dabbling on pservers showed similar patterns--toxicity on forums and subs, and trolls in general chat in-game, but people were still perfectly willing to group, help with quests, give advice, make friends, etc just like in vanilla. And this was on those bloated megaservers without small tight-knit communities.
---
I also met a shaman while leveling who was testing out and min/maxing the class's tanking capabilities. So there are still people doing what they want for funsies and stuff.
---
ZG isn’t at launch. Mages should be hitcapped when entering raids. 
---
&lt;3
---
I did that too!  Much cred for slow walking around capitals on it.
---
&gt;They pretty much are building it from scratch. Classic was lost a long time ago. The data we have from private servers was input by the creator of the original one. We don't actually know the values of monsters, drop rates, item procs, and skill values. Those were all lost.
---
Err, thats not true. They have that information. They just have to port it to made it work on modern hardware.
---
[You forgot the final panel](https://gfycat.com/ringedsparklingfruitfly)
---
Ok, so this is an issue with the number of players then. Not with the accuracy of the server itself.
---
Also keep in mind that all the old guys coming back from 2006 won't be nearly as active as they used to be. That means in order to maintain an authentic level of player density you'll need more players in total on a server. That would require the ability to deal with bursts of high activity from this larger player base. I think the cap should be raised to at least 5k if not 10k.
---
I’s the cookiecutter middle way the does not stand out. Neither a tribal brutish troll/orc/tauren or a gimpish small gnome or dwarf. Also not a legolas stereotype night elf. 
---
My self I always play dwarf if possible.
---
Thanks Sbeve.
---
Honestly, I would prefer that the prices remain as they were.
---
Remember too, the 200g for a mount was coupled with 800G for the Epic Riding skill, so at least for your first mount it was still 1000G.
---
I understand Elwynn is first but Durotar is last? :O  
---
Well, it is a bit orange I suppose.
---
You seem to think Blizzard of today is the same people as they were 15 years ago when Vanilla launched. Vanilla Blizzard wouldn't do it. Current day Blizzard absolutely would.
---
He's completely wrong. But companies do lose shit all the time. Square Enix, who was bigger than Blizzard, lost the source code to multiple games, including the original Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy VIII. Blizzard lost the original renders for Starcraft.

Private Server values are so far off it doesn't count.
---
You could just not post if you want to ignore his questions because he isn't a perfect copy of you and appreciates the game for different reasons.
---
if you buff meme specs like paladin and DL (jaina) with resilience it will make more alliance players and balance ratio
---
pVp is from classic so adding pVp stat is NO CHANGES still and is good for long term success of Classic WoW
---
I just want the models as high quality as retail. 
---
It cant possibly hamper the game and I don't want to be looking at a game from 2004 for hours on end.
---
Hey! I don't think armor should be your main focus but these two particular items (gloves of the immortal from AQ40 and necro-knight's garb from Naxx) are really worth it in terms of PvP survivability (if you don't have the rank 13 set  which is pure facemelt material that is).
---
You should watch the behind the scenes when they talk about Tirisfal Glades. I think both Horde and Alliance are pretty much equal.
---
basically nonexistent
---
I like to play as a dead human. Still count?
---
Always go for rank 3, you also get lower rep cost and ingredients. 
---
Yea I feel the same way. I plan on going hard in the paint for Classic but it would help to have a date already just so I could plan out my Summer. While I know the Pax East rumor is total crap I'm hoping something comes out regardless. Another interesting fact... there has been 6 Classic Blue posts since March 1st which is the most communication we've ever had on the Classic topic.
---
I don't think expansions are ever ready for that reason. They're always released every 2 years. Even TBC, most of the raids didn't work properly. 
---
Diablo III was never going to be good, no matter how much time they spent on it. They didn't have the talent. Keep in mind, it was in development for like 7 years or something insane. 
---
I can see future wows changing much for the good if classic will be a big hit again
---
It just seems like such an immensely specific and rare situation that OP is presenting. Loot trading still applies even if Master Loot is enabled. So in this situation OP needs on Perdition's Blade (presumably he's a rogue), he wins it, doesn't equip it himself for some unknown reason even though the ML wouldn't give it to him if it wasn't an upgrade, then trades it to his friend who was also in the raid and is also a rogue. Such a rare hypothetical. 
---
This is the answer I expected.
---
Here's the thing. People who are collectors will simply buy them before they get riding.
---
You didn't need skills to buy, just to ride. So if the price is low but they say "only for a month" everyone will just buy them even if they can't ride them right now. They'll have months/years to earn enough gold for riding.
---
The only way to make like before would be to have the price flop like before (if only temporarily).
---
Because their racial are op
---
Close indication is not the same as the real thing.
---
Ofc private server records don't count, they are their own thing. The record to 60 has to be done on a legitimate server and will be soon enough! Private servers are great for getting the general gist and I imagine will be quite similar in the end 
---
u dont like the extra resilience of dwarfs? its only good for pvp
---
No, that's not what I said. I said that pretending to have more in common with Humans than for example Gnomes in world of warcraft doesn't make sense, therefore that argument makes no sense to me. 
---
Even pservers are only a hint of what Classic class distribution will be. It takes a certain type of person to go through the process of playing on a pserver. I bet Classic has way more hunters and rogues than the surveys show. They're very appealing at first glance, especially if you don't already know what the end game is like.
---
paid server transfers. be happy on a low or medium pop realm. re-roll on another server.  cross realm BGs. seems pretty simple.
---
It'd probably make more sense to make style the meme after that Drake one. 
---
People who don't want to be an elf, but still want to benpver 5 feet tall, I'm assuming.
---
There's literally no reason for them to do what you're describing...
---
I love how unspectacular they are. They are mortals in a world full of elves, orcs, dragons, and demons. The odds are stacked against them in almost every way, and yet they prevail on cunning, bravery, and willpower alone. The warcraft movie left a lot to be desired, but I always think back to [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0niE8EBjko) when this question comes up.
---
King's honor my guy
---
Lost to Mn in a 1v1, btw. 
---
it's not going to be locked to loot type, only instance type. ML or GL doesn't matter, whoever wins can still trade it. big problem for instances like zg and aq20 which are often pugged
---

Thanks! That explanation was actually fantastic.

The change to make loot trading only in raids (excluding UBRS) fixes the majority of concerns.

We will be.

lol? what the fuck are you on mate

A soup counts as a meal!

Hobbs videos are in TBC. If you aoe packs in a smaller scale it can work solo-wise. Otherwise, you won't be able to solo SM like hobbs does without a little backup.

With specific equipment, there is the vine mobs you can aoe in Diremaul. Like in this. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri6fGNBoVJY

It's better than being the #1 guild on a dead realm people are rerolling to get off of.
---
Yeah neither of those two statements are true. Both are opinions based on conjecture. 
---
It was hard enough killing soul link warlocks and prot specced flag carriers. The last thing we need is that god awful resilience stat that turned all pvp into snooze fest drain teams. 
---
Arguably the equivalent to this has always gone on: they paid for magazines they review their games presumably
---
Wow that’s so wild, thanks for sharing. I had no idea.

You’ll be fine just slower.

That guy is the CEO now
---
I have hear a lot of cool stories from Naxx so I hope they could bring that to Classic to.
---
I play horde for exactly your reasoning. Aside from Night Elves, the Alliance are humans, shorter humans, and even shorter humans. 
---
No reason except to pander to the casuals, like they have been doing for the past decade. Like I said, I don't trust Blizzard not to fuck it up.
---
&gt;I'm not an elf. I'm not an orc. I'm not a gnome.
---
Dude when I read that all the fucking gnome memes popped up in my head all over again
---
&gt;I don't see this demographic running around and being toxic
---
I see you are new here.
---
Denari?
---
That a server? I was on Kilrogg, wiping with its namesake!
---
Yea, meaning it was wrong for over a decade.
---
&gt; They could release a buggy mess that they slowly fix for months
---
It should take a couple years, TBH. \#nochanges

This is it boys, we have reached peak hype.

Never before has such a high effort level of memery graced our screens.
---
ONE OF US!!
---
I think it is because players identify with them more easily. In most fiction where there are other intelligent species, the main character is typically human for that reason.
---
And also because most players aren’t as cool as Trolls.
---
Starts off as full Classic starting zones and then phases you to a garrison after you turn in the first set of quests, and you can't leave. 
---
If they have any sense of humor, it will be legit Diablo Immortal news. 
---
Your saying that you don't have more in common with a race that is physiologically the same as you compared to a 3 foot tall pygmy person?
---
They would temporarily allow over the limit on the assumption people will quit, then after a while I assume server queues
---
From what I remember your assessments are about correct regarding to raid off-tanking. Keep in mind that your MT will simply not always show up, that is one of the main reasons to have more tanks or people who can tank in the early raids.
---
As for Naxx the majority of fights you'll be tanking since there are a whole bunch of encounters with adds. Especially the four Horsemen encounter is tank heavy.
---
Also consider this: As an offtank you'll be ready to taunt even on single tank fights while you DPS. Not ever fight goes smooth and your MT will not survive every time if the raid is not "on farm".
---
As in regards to Druid vs. Warrior off-tank: Both are useful when not tanking but they do different things. As a Warrior off-tank you'll be swinging utility weapons mostly and as a Druid you'll be DPSing and in very rare cases you might heal/decurse.
---
The benefit of choosing Druid is easier itemisation in general, especially in higher tier raids there is loot that is specifically made for Feral Druids or hybrid Druids that noone else will want. Another benefit is that you are in the middle ground of a Prot Warrior and a Fury Warrior in regards to tanking survivability, threat and DPS.
---
The benefit of choosing Warrior is that you can tank more bosses optimally if needed. You also generally have more tools for several things. You have more ways to pull threat / catch aggro. You have more defensive cooldowns, you can use consumables more reliably. You will also be lighter on your healers. Also it is probably a bit easier to find a guild. If a guild already has a tanking druid or two they will be reluctant to invite another even if it would benefit them. As a Warrior you will always find a place.

You can cast your whole screen with Chromecast I believe but from what I've seen it tends to be a little laggy, I'd do the long HDMI cable. Definitely wireless keyboard/mouse 
---
its very important that we realize warlocks are EVIL and should be the class that people seek to destroy in a player Versus player environment
---
CLASSIC world Of warcraft is about the ATMOSPHERE and LORE and if you watch the WoW movie you can see warlocks are supposed to be strong (gu'ldan uses his power to defeat many orcs)
---
NO CHANGES means we need to keep the spirit of war craft alive
---
I know it's possible for very high-end guilds, my point is that it's not anywhere near what an average or even above average guild will do. A lot of the responses in that thread are saying things like "most guilds" or "any decent guild".
---
The average guild will struggle to get MC + BWL on a single night clear. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if the average guild struggles to get through BWL at all before the AQ content release.
---
Reread my original post. It specifically says other than looks.

A community.

You'll just have more downtime, but you'll be fine. You'll find you naturally do a hamstring kite if you're low on health. Doing it for every mob gets old, so a mix is best imo.

So vanilla was response-impaired.  That's the definition of lag.

He clearly means replaced as the top method of points-based loot systems. You don't see many people doing DKP anymore.

i forgot how sad shawshank redemption is

This is beautiful.

I'd love the calender from retail to remain cause it's much easier to manage events and raids that way.
---
on a fresh server I always make two chars. one main and one NE druid. I run the druid to the nearest inn and logout and accrue rested xp until i decide its his time to shine. I usually will come back to him before my main is 60 but when i have some gold. 
---
a great early strat is to get the lowish level LW armor things and send them. free stam at low levels makes your downtime 9esp as a druid with the hots) insane. people really like hunter but since its an alt i recommend druid. travel form and heals + low gear dependance is great. 
---
For me it's because I have the exact human settings down I want in character creation. Best portrait. also I mained human for long time due to every man for himself when it was meta. I'm used to them and their animations. 
---
Right? 
---
The entire reason we even have Classic in re-development is because of stubborn, longstanding community interest in it. If "blizzlike" private servers feel closer to vanilla than Classic servers, then what was the point of this entire ordeal? If they didn't listen to what players want out of Classic (like the changes to content phases) then they may as well have not bothered doing it at all.
---
They're not listening out of generosity, but because they *have to* understand what's good/bad for the Classic servers or there's no point to any of it.
---
60% might be
---
&gt;What happens if your 20k tourists decide they like it and don't want to leave ?
---
Then blizzard would be extremely happy to have to figure out that problem at that time. But they aren't gonna worry about it too much because that won't ever happen. 
---
This is awesome. I'm upvoting this entire thread.
---
Yeah, this scene always destroys me.
---
I was in a guild with DKP back in BC. The first night we killed Gruul, a pair of DPS Warrior bracers dropped. We only had one DPS Warrior present and he needed them but didn't want to spend DKP on them because obviously he would rather spend them on cooler upgrades. Absolutely nobody else was interested in them but the guild and raid leaders refused to let him have the bracers without spending DKP. They ended up getting sharded.
---
 I left the guild not too long after that. It still ticks me off, the guy had been with us since early vanilla it's not like he was a pug or an alt even, he was a very dedicated core raid member.
---
Hopefully people will use more sensible loot systems this time around. 
---
Modern WoW feels like a mount and transmog collecting game. The MMO and the RPG aspect of the game is lacking very hard imo.
---
“I am 100% for the no change mentality of classic, because any change could have a huge effect on making the game less classic.”
---
But here’s some stuff I want changed.
---
You’re not 100% no change. 
---
Yea exactly. Although the best NR gear still came from the dragons (for tanks anyway  I think the ring also? ) and you had to balance between your raiding gear and 'of nature resistance' gear so that you had decent hp/NR/dmg.
---
As much as it sucked it's still cool to think resists are coming back in a way
---
tf do you mean accessible?  They're both easily accessible.  As long as you have a computer and an internet connection, you can pick either up and play it, for however long you want to.  "Meaningful progress" is entirely subjective.  Logging onto Classic for an hour and banging out a couple quests is easy.  Fuck I do it all the time.  The fact that you're comparing the /played time of Classic and Retail is pretty laughable.  The xp rates of Vanilla are *drastically* lower than retail.  Leveling wasn't an arbitrary chore that you had to faceroll through to get to the "real game", leveling was a journey, an adventure, and it made it up a huge chunk of your playtime.  When you have grossly inflated XP rates, every mob from 1 - 110 having nerfed damage and hitpoints, and then pile a whole set of heirlooms on top of it, no shit you're going to progress faster.  When you say "accessible", you mean "casual friendly".  Very important distinction.
---
So given your opinion of what constitutes accessible, then yeah, saying Vanilla is more accessible is a blatant lie.
---
I disagree with that, the action always happened on the ground, you still met people at point of interests, farming locations, quest hubs. I can't remember too much interaction happening while running on the road between these areas, especially on a PVE realm. Even that it was classified as Full.  
---
Even if there was a little PVP in TBC, you could still chase someone on flying, just like you could chase someone with a 100% mount in Vanilla.
---
i played on the venture co (eu) , it was amazing, lotf of active people , some rping, good guilds, and pretty balanced alliance/horde, also, guys from the yogscast played on the server and had this podcast waay before yogscast got big, server was pretty awesome
---
As a shadow priest, in pvp, faces will be melted
---
Yep. Wireless have come a long way, just as fast nowadays.
---
Modern wow has its improvements, that’s only natural. It’s negative tho is that it’s not an MMO nor an RPG. It’s a city q hub and action game.
---
I honestly feel like younger people that are used to a particular type of game just won't like the pace of classic, and I think that's just fine.  Even if they do, I think this type of game fosters a less toxic environment in general as compared to FPS or MOBA. Either way I think the community will largely be a bunch of rad dudes
---
I totally agree with you about Axl Rose. As for slash tho, yeah he looked a lot better in his younger years, but I don’t think he looks THAT bad now. He does looks a little rough, but he could definitely look a lot worse
---
and night elves are just humans with silly ears
---
No patching / updates = low cost
---
Well yes, but I've read that people just don't use it anymore due to the history it conjures up. I mean its not advisable as it could fck up your child's life in so many ways. 
---
Last time I got my rank then went on a killing spree. Think I held the server record but there were rumours of a gnome with more
---
It always feels so empty though. I love the atmosphere, but you feel so far away from anything interesting. That walk from Teldrassil to IF is such a bitch

"Incorrect xp rates"
---
My guild back in Vanilla/TBC was known on our server purely because of our names and the guild name. We weren't super famous or anything, but people would recognize our names.
---
Oh please, don't be pedantic. We all know what he's saying. We all wanted things back in Vanilla.
---
Just because you want something the nostalgia trip unaltered doesn't mean you can't admit some changes were for the best and/or didn't screw with general design philosophy.
---
I read somewhere that you can't cast games with Chromecast unless they are in windowed mode. Also I wonder what the lag would be like. But I'll definitely try of it works
---
I play mostly orcs and gnomes.   Never had a human main character, but for an alt I like them, for there +10% reputation bonus.   It is never fun to grind faction rep once you have done it before. 
---
Yea.. he pulled a lot of random unrelated numbers into a giant post, but it's all garbage and made up more than the person he's trying to correct...
---
sweet! tysm :D
---
i gotcha! thank you
---
You stole my idea I posted yesterday :P
---
Yeah, that strong SPriest rotation game, the pinnacle of DPS raiding in vanilla.
---
Yes it does because people quit world PvP if someone else in the raid tags a civilian
---
Here's how "notoriously" incorrect they really are:
---
I'm partially surprised Classic servers are even going to be a thing, since they can't shoehorn microtransactions into it like Activision did with the remastered COD:MW.
---
Similar boat here. Warlock or spriest? Leaning lock because it's easier for me to gear up for pvp, and that's really my main focus. 
---
I really hope phase 1 won't be 6 months, seeing that phase 2 is mostly Dire Maul. Should be around 2-3 months in my opinion.
---
You can count your swings yourself and not hamstring kite if you like. I wouldn't be surprised if most warriors did this while levelling back in the day. In areas very crowded with mobs, you won't be kiting very far anyway. You'll get to 60, but it will be slower and you'll spend more time eating after every mob. Probably less time corpserunning too.
---
I think looking at these things as laborious preparation is the wrong perspective to have. 
---
 Hamstring kiting has 0 complexity to it. You press hamstring and a strafe button, that's it. If you run across the mob instead of showing it your back you won't get dazed on the 1 hit it gets in, then you just wait til your swing is ready again and strafe back the other way. Repeat. It's intuitive when you're playing. You can learn it on the first mob you practice on. It's so useful because its easy to do. 
---
Installing a swing timer like Samuel won't take you more than 5 minutes even if you've never installed an addon before. More like 2 minutes if you have. 
---
If levelling to 60 takes you 250 hours (which is good for a first time warrior), 5-10 minutes to sort this out is a no brainer. You'll be spending most of your time either killing mobs or recovering from killing mobs, so anything that shortens your time spent on one of those will pay off big time. 
---
Not to mention access to sweeping strikes at level 30 which is huge imo. I think arms is a much smarter choice, esp considering you dont have to respec at 40.
---
Yo shut the hell up already you don’t know shit. Quest drops are vastly different on ur favorite lh core compared to vanilla. I actually played unlike ur young ass who was 5 years old when you play and since you play private servers now you thinknur some pro when ur actually such shit at the game. 
---
And I beat Joana to level 6 back in the day on a fresh launch and received all the praise. Ur some bitch boy living off welfare gtfo. 
---
Equally as brilliant as the OP.  Great job.  
---
Ingame guide as in an addon that tells you where to go and all that without having to read a pdf on a second monitor?
---
Link?
---
From my experience it did *not* work like that, as long as you made the final hit *and not your pet* you should get the proc. But hey, what do we know, it's 14 years ago.
---
Sadly, there will be a lot of kids playing this because their favorite streamer will milk Classic to get as much money as they can.
---
Aside from that, I think the community will be alright for the most part, just like Nost's was.
---
What?
---
MC pugs will happen.  Rag kills will happen definetly.  Have you never played on any Pserver?
---
What was the pathing they used? I also leveled professions from 1-300 at 35 as a break from leveling on all the toons I did it to
---
So what? What's your argument? People shouldn't be allowed to get what they want?
---
Not to mention, who cares? It's not like open world RP is really much of a thing in the first place, even on RP servers. Actual RP is usually guild run events, which are scheduled in advance with someone leading/directing them. Having a bunch of dudes who want to chill on a server where they aren't corpsecamped by xXpooplordXx literally has zero impact on the people who want to RP.
---
I'm not an RPer, I could see myself getting into it because I play DnD and other tabletop RPGs, but I'm just not huge on the WoW lore. I've always admitted that I want to play on RP-PvP because I like world PvP but griefers are just annoying and don't contribute to the game IMO. Why shouldn't I be allowed on an RP server?
---
There won't be many toxic people in classic because the way the game is played is way different from retail. In retail you have people talking shit in dungeons because they know they will most likely never see you again, in classic the sense of "anonymity" is gone because you can't hide behind sharding and other systems.
---
You will obviously run into someone that is angry, but remember there's a difference between valid criticism and toxicity.
---
In terms of demographics I remember reading back in 2013 that the largest portion of players were between 20-25 (roughly 40% of active players). But that was as I said 6 years ago now so.. who knows, considering also that Blizzard stopped reporting numbers all we can do is guess.
---
They are probably betting on crossplay and expect that enough players will play  Retail _and_ Classic that they will be able to finance Classic and make extra money from MTX off those players.
---
Same. And I even got a tear in my eye just thinking about that scene. So damn perfect. 
---
I would choose to have the priest take last hit and have the Lock spec for improved life tap. The priest throws a renew here and there and he gets the improved mana regen from talents.
---
Yea, also betting that warrior population will be &lt;20. People wont care as much about what is best dps compared to private servers
---
I'm not convinced bloodvine is a good choice for a pvp set.
---
60% mount will be there, the  NPC is in Ratchet.
---
Let me introduce you to Taurens
---
* Guild bank and expanded bank (at a cost): Bank didn't effect gameplay so much as it just limited collectors. All we did was make Bank alts which meant less playable slots and was functionally the same thing.
---
* Global LFG (hear me out): no cross server, no teleporting, just a better system to organize other than spamming trade chat. Trade chat is theoretically for trading but it always ended being for everything because it was the only global channel between cities.

If you like PvP then definitely horde. Not only has Orc arguably the best PvP racials (especially against Rogues which are a threat to WLs) but as horde you wont have to deal with with undeads and their wotf.
---
Spellpower is split into healing and damage in vanilla. With a support role you will collect healing spellpower that does nothing for your shadow spec. Might as well play shadow all the way. But there is only one slot per raid and even that is not certain. When there are not enough healer, you will be asked to spec heal and collect heal gear. 
---
That makes far more sense. I'd have noticed if it was the other one. 
---
That's not how servers work anymore.
---
Shadow cloud gaming - though I think by now there are other services. Last I checked it only worked in California  last year.

Supposed to be able to hook it up to any screen

2. Install this. http://keysticks.net/site/default.aspx

3. Spend forever mapping it.
---
4. Play wow on the PC connected to the TV
---
alternatively, get a battery powered bluetooth mouse and keyboard, like an actual civilized person, you dirty heathen.
---
Isn't it just Darnassus boat to Stormwind, then Deeprun Tram to IF? 
---
The comparison is not an apples-to-apples game-to-game comparison though. It's justifying $15 on this form of entertainment versus another form on entertainment. It's supposed to be an apples-to-oranges comparison.   
---
Ok, grinding bear butts for 1.5 hrs may not be worth the same $7.50 the movie was, but the 12 nights of raiding with your buddies for 3 hours each night was definitely worth more.
---
I use to lead these raids in Alliance Cities on Gul'dan Server almost every week in Classic-BC. Played a Shadow Priest named Poltergeist. Can't wait for classic so I can do this again
---
If you're feeling gnome go gnome. I know a great gnome MT.
---
Escape artist breaking frost nova will net you a LOT of mage kills. 
---
I used my wife's laptop to hook up to the tv and then used a wireless mouse and keyboard. The hard part was finding a comfortable surface for the keyboard and mouse. 
---
I made the mistake of playing an Alliance lock on Nostalrius.
---
It was a bad, bad time.
---
I was using casual numbers for the average person to compare :)
---
Beware that, when fighting bullies, you yourself do not become a bully... for when you gaze long into Stranglethorn Vale.  Stranglethorn Vale gazes also in to you.  
---
Do you have proof of what values are off and by how much? 
---
Thanks. I'm surprised at the number of folks on the subreddit who answer questions with a variation of "that's not how to have fun". How about we all have fun in our own way, and group up later for a combined-version-of-fun 5man? 😁
---
Unless I missed something huge, there was no Stormwind boat in vanilla.
---
I'm not necessarily feeling gnome but I can handle being one. My main concern is getting passed up on weps because I'm non-human especially if im an OT or DPS at the end of the day. 
---
Started in Wrath oh lordy. You were the guy that came late to a party that was just about done. 
---
My favorite comedy movie of all time. Timeless classic.
---
Not really.
---
#nochanges means you want the game as it was, so you can play it as it was.
---
Since server caps were not fix during classic, it would be good to be able to choose between servers of  small (1k), medium (3k) and and large (5k) population.
---
The game's state (e.g. crz, spell batching, patch progression) stays the same for all servers. 
---
this.
---
And they're correct now. that makes the previous values being wrong relevant because?
---
Hang in there Brooks!!!!
---
How can I help?
---
The simple answer: Do whatever you want the most. Unless you absolutely want to mix/max to the highest degree, then it doesn't really matter what your race/class combo is unless you plan to be in the top 1% doing content as hardcore as possible, whether that be PvE or PvP.
---
Otherwise: If you're going PvP, then yeah the Orc racial is really good. If you're going PvE, then yeah that Gnome Int. boost is really good. It honestly just depends on what you want to do most.
---
The only two I know from memory are cold ridge valley and Northshire Abbey.
---
Very good point, pvp could get stale if I am unable to fear 40% of my enemies effectively.
---
I think there's a good chance we get guild banks. They are a security feature as much as anything. Guilds used to just have someone make a bank alt and share their password which is obviously awful for security. Similar to why we got loot sharing, it's an expensive pain to deal with for blizzard.
---
So was Red
---
Specific information about a server no? But all server side values like drop rates, internal cool downs and spawn rates are guesses by private servers. They have the code but not the DB.
---
Some values will be high, some low. Some might even be mostly right. But when you're talking about fudging an hour or a day on world first Vanilla, you're not running on the same values. 
---
There  was at least one pull in MC that you could do using eye of the beast to avoid aggroing extra packs. (Geddon maybe? It's been a while.)
---
Sharding has nothing to do with server caps. Sharding is for overcrowded zones, so you're not all competing for the same mobs.
---
I think they may be adamant about them not being in at launch, but they are probably real open to adding them in later if they see the demand. Depends on how long it takes to actually get the servers up and running i think.
---
According to mark Kern, the maximum the hardware could handle was 3.5k-4k. And he confirmed the caps were "more or less 3k." So arguing for a cap higher than 3k could arguably be seen as a change, and anything higher than 4k would definitely be a change.
---
I have a feeling most of these end up on the list after someone makes them and gets reported. So, probably pretty accurate about 5th graders lol.
---
I played alliance WL back in vanilla and I remember really getting annoyed in PvP. Especially in the mirror match since UD warlocks will have a significant advantage over you. As an Orc though you are on an even playing field against alliance WLs but cover your weakness against rogues and stuns in general with hardiness.
---
We are /r/iamverysmart
---
Paragraph 1: More or less all correct, I would recommend a mostly arms build for levelling though, not much you'll need from fury except 5/5 cruelty, and you'll want to go into deep arms at 40 either way for mortal strike with your fat 2h. There's virtually no hit gear while levelling, until you're very close to 60, and even then you're unlikely to get enough to make dual wielding better than 2h for those last few levels. Respecc at 60. 
---
You will find a guild just fine as dw fury. Every raid group will have a few DPS warriors, but as others have said, and as you know, you'll want to carry a tanking set. You can get a lot of guild brownie points tanking 5/10 man guild runs too. If you're worried about being effective at both roles, I would recommend this build where you can tank and DPS effectively, mostly by sacrificing deep wounds  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LV0bZVVzVhxoVoebzoo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LV0bZVVzVhxoVoebzoo) 
---
Most people at least back in vanilla wanted to rank, it was a big part of the game. And for many classes a lot of the PvP gear is amazing pre bwl 
---
I understand that for sure, as it's a different situation. I just want them to take ample time to make sure they give us a polished product. 
---
Also a good point
---
holy shit a crt monitor
---
I do. You, however, did not get the point xd
---
But it is a looks thing. It's an anything to push your own emersion thing. There are two types of people that play lots of video games. There are those looking for escapism from their reality and those looking to escape their environment. 
---
People who main humans (I literally will always play a human in any game if my class is able. Going as far as to pick my second choice of gameplay to fit the options) are the ones looking for escape from environment. The world is what interests me, not being a dwarf/troll. Humans are the apex predator of our reality, so of course I want to represent. There is pride in being a human. There is versatility and strength. Yes, mechanically they will play nearly the same, but it boils down to what you are looking for.
---
I'd rather wake up and be myself, capable of wielding the light or shaping reality through the arcane, than say, have the exact same powers but be any non human. It's kind of like faction pride taken a step further and it carries over to all games that I play.
---
Take whatever definition you want and its still in favor of retail.
---
I meant it more along the lines of how much of the game do you get to access based on time invested, which yeah I guess could be "casual friendly". As in you won't get to do much unless you invest time.
---
In the first 20 hours of retail a new player is more likely to see more of the class, complete more quests, do more dungeons, see more zones, just generally get to play the game more. 
---
First 20 hours of vanilla a new player will see 2-3 zones and get some vague idea of the class, with huge part of that time spent running from place to place. The classes don't really get rolling until 35-40, at least in my experience.
---
Whether one is better than the other is not up to me and not what I'm talking about, but its just a general outline of how I view it.
---
It was about 1.5 Alliance to 1 Horde. Overall, unbalanced in the extreme.
---
Imagine getting to play vanilla for the first time, all these years later, I’m jealous 
---
Brooks ;_;
---
I don't want to see them. The only reason 90% of people like them is due to their eventual rarity, which this time round they wouldn't be anyway. People can deny this but the fact that the vast majority of players switched for a shiny epic one back in the day confirms this.    
---
I do think it's a shame to lose them forever so maybe they could integrate them some other way which maintained their rare status.
---
Playing on Saturday mornings.  I would just log in and run around herbing while I had something I was only half-paying attention to on TV.  Server was mostly logged off around that time and I'd have it seemed like entire zones to myself.  I'd make my rounds from Silithus =&gt; Winterspring =&gt; Burning Steppes =&gt; EPL harvesting all the Black Lotus.  I'd stop in Azshara, Felwood, and Blasted Lands for Dreamfoil and Gromsblood.  It was mindless and relaxing.  
---
So was Metzen
---
I wasn't speaking for all servers.
---
In France the hardcore community usually choose the first PVP server in alphabetical order to settle in (Archimonde back in Vanilla).
---
I already saw some old Vanilla guilds (War Legend) saying they would continue with this tradition.
---
This server will get a lot of attention, and the percentage of player retention will be far higher than random PVE server number 3 for example.
---
There won't be enough black lotus for everybody on these servers (not my problem, I will certainly roll on random PVE server number) but I still wonder how Blizz is going to handle it.
---
no
---
There will probably be people trying it out and then stopping. I don't disagree with that. But we have no way to know how many versus how many will not. We also don't know how many more players will join post launch and whether this makes up for any players lost during launch.
---
We know nothing about the numbers for any of those things. So instead of it being "a given" I would claim it is "unknown."
---
And there it is, this is a trust issue that people have with Blizzard, it's not an actual issue (like Blizzard announcing 4 content phases when more phases would be better).
---
Every single point of communication from Blizzard has indicated that they are painstakingly remaining authentic to Classic and that they are acutely aware of how incredibly important server communities are to the Vanilla experience. First of all, if you don’t realize that blanket sharding would effectively gut the classic community (which would also be counter-productive fiscally) then you don’t really know the classic community. Second of all, implementing something so antithetical to something so fundamental to Vanilla would be completely out of character for a team that’s been so meticulous about remaining true to Vanilla.
---
You’re obviously free to blindly mistrust Blizzard, but that doesn’t change the fact that the currently described usage of sharding is not something the vast majority of people have a problem with (most of them are actually in favor of it). The main point I was making was that sharding isn’t currently something the community wants addressed, they’re more looking for reassurances of it permanently being removed shortly after launch (in addition to specifically where and how long it will be used at launch).
---
Oh idk... if only you had an option to change your specc...
---
I fully agree, always wanted to play before but by the time I was actually able to get a PC that was where it was at. I still play retail (one night a week) but I think the community is all but gone. I want to feel weak and the progress and I strive for 60. I want to be able to look at others and say "wow, maybe one day I'll have that gear" I don't want to be "the almighty savior of the planet" I just want to be a guy making my way through the world, trying to make my mark. Everyone I talk to on retail is crying about how "oh you'll come straight back" or "you'll miss all the quality of life stuff" basically repeating the whole "you think you do but you don't"
---
I wanna fall in love with this world again. I want to take my time and enjoy it all, all that I was never able to experience all those years ago. I look forward to seeing you all there :) 
---
Hi, /u/deviousambition
---
Looks the best in gear, the end
---
Something having a history of being incorrect should at least leave a rational person in a position of doubting their current accuracy.
---
No dual spec. I haven't seen this confirmed, but its most unlikely that this will be in Classic.
---
That said, your best bet to reduce the amount of times you have to respec between PvE and PvP is to find a guild that raids the day before and day after raid resets. This gives you at least 5 days in your PvP spec, instead of having to swap back and forth 4+ times a week.
---
I imagine they will never add it, they already have a game with a cash shop in it in the form of retail wow. 
---
My Vanilla raiding experience stops at MC .I gquited because the guild was completely destroyed by some toxic players including the GM.
---
I should have mentioned that, sorry.
---
You can hit Pet Follow when the mob gets low HP though. Pulls the VW off so this doesn't happen. 
---
God damnit shawshank redemption is a good movie.
---
Had some fun applications at times too. A lot of the elite troll city in the hinterlands, Jintha'Alor, could be skipped through some fairly easy jumps that could be taught to your party quickly.
---
Similarly in Winterspring as part of the Onyxia attunement chain you need to go through a cave full of elite blue dragonkin but as an alternative a few precise jumps could get you to the quest NPC on the mountainside.
---
Hmmm, indeed. Works on 1.12 pservers too.
---
Love em
---
Vanilla used to run at ~2.5 'frames' per second on the servers.
---
BFA currently runs at ~12-50 'frames' per second on the servers.
---
The former feels like playing through molasses, the latter feels smooth. Molasses are an authentic classic experience.
---
&gt;Human are the most important Alliance race in the narrative
---
Maybe now, but in Vanilla I’d argue dwarves were more important.  Ironforge was where most people set their hearth, they had a big deal about finding the origins of their race, took in the Gnomes after Gnomergan went radioactive, and had a major conflict with the Dark Iron dwarfs and their missing princess.  
---
Humans, by comparison, were mostly stuck with the defias questline which, while epic, was mostly insulated relative to the rest of the happenings in the world.  And we STILL never found the king until he showed up 2 expansions later.
---
Varian returning was the point where Humans stepped in to the limelight, but even that was because he showed up and pouted about the horde while Magni mostly stayed at home, and then got stuck for a couple of expansions while the council of three hammers took over.
---
Dual Talent Spec was one of the things Blizzard got right post vanilla but it would still be wrong to include it at the 1.12 starting point.
---
I wouldn't object to them including it later though, as long as it costs the original 1000G and not the pittance it is now.
---
&gt; Most armour sets and such are seemingly designed with Humans first in mind
---
As far back as I can remember to even some sets of Heritage Armor made in Live today, the gear is modeled on Humans and then just meshed to the models and geosets of other races, which is why Worgen and Tauren helmets consistently look dumb as hell. It just really baffles me that in Live, the sets that are made for *one specific race and can be only worn by that one specific race* aren't even modeled on that race and are still modeled on Humans. I think only the Kul Tiran heritage armor's coat was modeled with the Kul Tiran thiccness in mind because of how unique the shape of the model is, and if it was modeled on a Human it would just clip through the Kul Tirans' lovehandles. 
---
&gt;lych king
---
If he’s practicing on a repack, he’s completely alone. Journey did 1-60 in 3 days 7 hours on a fresh launch with ridiculous population. It’s a bit of a stretch but we could potentially see sub 3 days /played 60s for Classic.
---
No, and the real (originally intended) option might come as a surprise if you're accustomed to hyper-optimisation: hybrid-PvE/PvP specs. Instead of being the best at PvP AND the best at PvE... you can be good at both simultaneously, just not the best.
---
It was then rehosted privately later the very same day, then when that private version got to big again, he closed it, again. I dont think he ever wanted his server to be as big as it got, many people believe the letter thing was just to kill the server so he could have his smaller server he wanted, but then it got too big again so he killed it again.
---
I have fond memories of exploring there as a Cow.
---
Sharding *is* the solution to server pop caps. Unless you want to play in dead servers, once the tourists leave, that is.
---
&gt; switching back and forth wasnt an option because of gold
---
It wasn't an option *for you* because you were *broke*.
---
The easiest answer is to give free transfers off a server that's too crowded. If there's a 30 minute queue to log in, people will take it. Dealing with low pop servers is harder because there's not much better than merges, but merges suck. 
---
I'll probably settle on this. Send pet onto new monster and let priest wand it dead. Dot up next, repeat. Fears during adds or pvp jump. Benefit of this is a little more of a gear split-  Spirit going to priest and stamina going to lock, inasmuch as that would split the cloth drops (still not much). 
---
&gt; This HAS to happen, because epic world pvp battles are a staple of Vanilla.
---
Are they actually a staple of Vanilla, or are they something that 99% of this sub pretends happens, but only 1% actually participated in?
---
they did KT so dirty honestly
---
Scarlet Monastery set! Deadmines set! Wailing Caverns set! Basically lowbie dungeon sets.
---
On a pserver, I got rank 3 around lvl35 while just casually killing a few ennemies that were contesting my grinding spots.
---
I didn't even go in STV. 
---
I can agree with you that it's not flawless.
---
What I do enjoy specifically as warrior is that you mostly start with preraid BiS leather gear getting one shotted by qiraji guards in AQ20 and by the time you are in AQ40 most of your leather gear is replaced with plate. It kinda feels nice to have a character progression not just in stats but also in armor classes.
---
However paladins stay in cloth up until T3 which is a shame to be sure. Shamans have it much better wearing 3pc T2 and 5/5 T2.5 for awesome chainhealing.
---
Sorry, rank 11. I did get the mounts, but I got the rank wrong.
---
Human female casting animation.
---
That's not something you can plan around, though.
---
IDK I'm one of the 1% but I certainly enjoyed all the guild vs guild battles I had
---
The human female models have the best aesthetics IMO.  Also, gonna be grinding for a wintersaber kitty, so 10% rep bonus YES PLEASE.
---
Y'all have fun in Eastern kingdoms. Stay outta Kalimdor!
---
-horde loyal 
---
Okay, fine it wasn't pure fuck around. It was still minimal usefulness and utility to the point where it definitely fits his definition of a ribbon ability.
---
I should have said *I* valued it 100% for screwing around and it was best known for cheesing things. I always preferred to set a trap and set up my pulls with my range over a pet. Less margin for error and that way my dwarf wouldn't be chilling, completely immobilized in a hostile area. I never saw people using it to cheese raids. Hell, I remember that the majority of the time all our hunters only summoned their pet for bosses because of how fucked pathing was.
---
Yeah it's really difficult to remember the minutia of game interactions, especially as some of us old hats might be playing something completely different than the first time around.
---
Just being your pc into your area you want it get an HDMI to dvi cable and use your tv like a monitor, wireless keyboard and mouse problem solved.
---
I’d like to see a quest that involves rescuing Varian, and maybe having BE and Draenei introduced prior to a BC launch, but that’s really antithetical to what most people want out of classic.  
---
I remember the term 'Blasen' was also banned in chat. Which was ridiculous, since I found out when questing under water, someone told me the quest item is near the '#*!@+?'
---
(In German 'Blasen' means 'bubbles', but can also mean 'to blow')
---
Boat goes to menethil
---
Yeah. Nobody max level does anything in the old places except to grind for transmog, mounts, or pets. I mean, *maybe* loremasters people will screw around with quests - but there's no legitimate reason for people to want to go there otherwise.
---
It's a terrible waste. There's all this art, all this work put into these old areas that are off the beaten path no one needs to visit anymore. You don't even *need* to level through the burning crusade anymore!
---
All in the name of expediency. Levelling got too hard, got too *long* for people to deal with.
---
I miss the era where levelling *itself* was part of the game. Back in wrath I was in a guild for a while where a good portion had been playing since vanilla but had never gotten max level since - they just enjoyed playing old quests and doing old dungeons.
---
Come cataclysm, shortly after the revamp went live they vanished.
---
I got loremasters late in cataclysm - what a waste. It was much too *easy* and I ruined the leveling experience for myself. Every alt I tried to create afterwards was a terrible unrewarding grind until I'd hit the current expansion's content.
---
I guess that's why they introduced boosts. They've papered over a problem they created for themselves by trying to emphasize max level content over everything else.
---
... Problem is, there's nothing for a solo player to *do* after you do that content. Maybe classic won't be any different - but I think it'll take an *incredibly long time* for me to get through all of the quests and get max level. Maybe I never will - and I think that'll be just fine.
---
At that point there isn't enough gear with the Hit stat, and even if you stack those items you'll be missing out on way too much SP and Crit, so it's **definitely** not worth rushing to Hit cap.  
---
Example:
---
&gt;Kayser's Boots of Precision has 1% Hit.   
---
&gt;Omnicast Boots has 22 SP.      
---
A 1% Hit will NEVER worth anywhere near 22 SP at 
---
any moment of the game no matter what patch (or stage) Classic is in, therefore the Omnicast Boots will grant 
---
you more DPS than the Kayser's Boots of Precision 
---
will even though it brings you one stop closer at 
---
being hit capped.
---
Please send me what your pre-raid BiS would look like, I'm really curious to take a look at it.
---
but somewhere they said they just have to decide about phase 2-6, as phase 1 release date is already decided.
---
something something Chuck Norris
---
 But when you're talking about fudging an hour or a day on world first Vanilla, you're not running on the same values.   
---
Not really. It has literally been 15 years. Look at any other game and how far speed runs come in 15 years. 1 day is not unbelievable at all.   
---
Rather than just saying "Must be private server nonsense", you should look at the differences between the two runs and decide if the time was saved by a legitimate change in the strategy of the run or by incorrect values.
---
Humans have a cool backstory and lore to them too.
---
Just because they look like us doesn't mean they can't be interesting :)
---
Were they 100v100, or 12vs20, or 30vs26?
---
I see people constantly saying play horde warlock because ally have to deal with Will of the forsaken. I will admit it is an advantage they have but it certainly dose not mean death. As long as the rogues gear is not ridiculously higher level than yours you should win, people who say otherwise have no idea how to play a lock.
---
So yes, horde racials are better pvp wise (although perception is nice) it is not as devastating as people make it seem
---
And I lead the alliance raids/guild to defend this stuff from happening lol. Keep it up, this is the stuff I play wow for! FTA!
---
Don't forget that Onyxia questline is fully storydriven by humans. They contribute the most to the war effort by sheer numbers.
---
Humans are most concerned with the blackrocks orcs, hence Nefarian due to their struggles with Onyxia, Redridge Mountains orcs etc.
---
40v40 or 40v60 at raid entrances or 100v100 at world bosses
---
My original character on WoW was poopstick, I got reported and they made me change it. I don't see it listed though so looks like ol' poopstick is making a comeback.
---
I think you misspelled 'Dwarves'. 
---
So much this... He was the face the of the blood elves and had so much going for him.
---
That fact that he had a crush on Jaina, and Arthas took that away from him, and everything else too, and now Arthas has defeated his new master (Illidan)... 
---
The only lore worse than Kael'Thas and Bloodelf lore is the complete lunacy of Draenai as they exist in WoW. 
---
&gt; If theyre only available for the first few months will it relaly be 'everyone' (and their moms) that has them?
---
Do not overestimate the time it will take to level and make gold. 
---
Vanilla is (without a doubt) infinitely longer than the 20 hours it takes me in retail, but it won't be months until we see a good chunk of players hit 60.
---
It's not far fetched to assume that a good amount of people would get them this way.
---
It's this. 
---
First i laughed at the post, then remember how incredibly sad that scene is, man that scene always messes me up.
---
Most loot systems in general went away, between the shrinking of raid sizes, increase in loot drops, homogenization of gear, and then later on with personal loot.
---
Personally, I was in several guilds that did DKP after EP/GP was released, and I was never in a guild that ran EP/GP.
---
You also don't need to deal with shamans as a horde lock. Between earth shock, purging vw shield, grounding/tremor totems or windfury totem on the enemy warriors/rogues.. it's rough as a lock. On the flip side, curse of tongues destroys paladins
---
This is the best post I've ever seen on here LOL
---
How do they work?
---
Same for me - since Cata anyways. I got so damned mad at the beginning of that xpac. There was so much good - so much opportunity, and the people caps-locking on the forums just robbed us of it. Challenging heroic dungeons were a blast, but those got ripped away and then grinding them for rep was just that - a grind. The PVP was pretty great, too! That is, aside from the arms warrior fiasco. I worked my ass off to get a half blue-and-purple set of gear on my enhance shaman. I got two shotted (literally - just colossal smash + mortal strike and I was dead) on a regular basis by them and the entire pvp side of *WAR*craft lost its appeal. It just felt like a downhill slope from there.
---
I believe it is 30/0/21. It lets you burst and support with totems and a few heals.
---
Are you sure they will work in Classic because they work on the Legion client based demo? 
---
It mostly gets it due to being a good spot to get ganked. But you're right it is quite linear too. Good point.
---
At this point it's highly unlikely.
---
Long term once people get over the whole no change mantra and just want to enjoy the game, maybe.
---
The humans in Warcraft universe share a lot of human traits in the real world.
---
They are very diverse with diplomats like Jaina, POS racists like Proudmoore. They breed like rabbits and are everywhere, they are quite powerful and from a lore standpoint would have no problem stomping tauren and trolls. 
---
Humans in WoW are very similar to real life humans.
---
That's a fair criticism. Good point.
---
Sometimes I feed the birds hoping Jake might just show up..... he never does :(
---
Not as I'm aware. Getting DHKs removed is probably a long shot, to be honest, especially at launch, but it's one worth making noise about. They really did have a substantial chilling effect on world PvP, even more than the introduction of BGs already would have.
---
I am 28.   
---
I played Vanilla back in the day when I was a teenager. In fact, I was in a hardcore raiding guild and a lot of our members were early - mid 20s.   
---
So I would say anyone in that range is likely to be playing. Late 20's to early 40s are probably the people that were playing back then.

Usually you have a single super powerful machine. Software now can split a single machine into a *ton* of "virtual machines".  The difference in price between 50 virtual machines and 100 is absolutely nothing to blizzard.
---
I may be on server 1 and you are on server 37, but it's very possible we are communicating with the exact same piece of hardware. 
---
&gt; The current iteration of WoW (BfA) represents how the game (and the genre) has changed over the past decade. It's more of a Sandbox game.
---
Good description but I think you messed up the order of those sentences. Vanilla (soon Classic) is more of a sandbox game than BFA, even if neither are really sandbox.
---
How is the opposite true, when a whole bunch of people were literally told, to never play Classic in this very sub, by the casual players.
---
Haven't heard anything on this, but having characters stay on the same server in early WoW was awesome because you ended up getting to know/see the same players one either faction throughout your whole levelling experience. Each realm ended up having its own 'culture' before cross-realm stuff happened. I'd hate to see that change.
---
They haven't announced anything to my knowledge. 
---
Back in vanilla, there were some server transfers from PvE to PvE, and I think maybe some option for PvP to PvE. The idea of PvE to PvP was absolute blasphemy in Vanilla though. Us PvP realm players were absolutely adamant about them not doing that, and at the time, Blizzard listened.   
---
\_\_\_\_
---
Plus man, honestly if you're friends are playing WoW and you're playing too, frankly I'd say you should play with them. Like, on the one hand do what you want, but I'm just saying that WoW is more fun with friends.   
---
You're also correct that it'll be easier levelling PvE than PvP, but that's kind of the the whole point. Plus, as we've learned time and again in WoW, easier doesn't usually lead to a better experience in the long run... Although yes, that is subjective. 
---
&gt; Maybe RPVP would take off better on Round 2 of Vanilla, where people can make their toons when the leveling process is relevant to the server.
---
Except it wouldn't, because most people interested in playing Classic will have already established themselves on other servers, same as they did the first time around.
---
The only way to avoid repeating this mistake and give the RPvP crowd a chance to really demonstrate their numbers is to have RPvP servers available at launch. Anything else is putting a bandage on an already amputated limb.

I actually have set this up in my house so that I can play/use my beefy gaming computer from multiple TV's in my house. Newer NVIDIA cards have a feature called "gamestream" so that you can stream games to their SHIELD product, but its kinda expensive \~$200 so I set up a couple raspberry pi's that run "moonlight" an open source appication that reverse engineers the gamestream protocol. So I can connect wireless keyboard, mouse, and controllers to any of my tv's with a raspberry pi connected and stream and use my gaming computer. For mouse's my recommendation is a mouse with the ball on the top if you are actually playing on the couch since it doesn't require a good surface to play on.
---
I expect to have 0 HKs and 0 Honor by the time I clear Naxx.
---
Unless I need Lei of the Lifegiver from AV as an offhand when AV comes out. Then farm just enough to get that.
---
And Tauren shamans do look badass! Sadly no Tauren if you wanna be alliance. 
---
Haha good one
---
But I wonder if they have everything ironed out for phase 1 already? Based on recent feedback, it seems that they are responding to community feedback and mulling over options internally. Maybe they have already made those decisions and are just hand picking things to respond to for good publicity. 
---
My worry is that they don’t have everything finished up before the phase 1 release and are actively working on it. If they give us a release date now, then realize there’s a major but that has to be fixed before release, that’s less development time right now for development of phase 2 and beyond. It can create a cycle that never ends. I say “my worry.” I’m not really “worried” but I could just see that being a potential issue for them. 
---
I don't RP so those things you listed doesn't really matter to me. I usually play human because I don't really like playing as "monsters"
---
lol, love it.
---
Yeah that does seem weird. I thought I remembered a commercial from before I played the game. Apparently not. We cannot be trusted with our memories!
---
Humans are straight from medieval fantasy though, which is pretty relatable. Everyone knows some medieval history.
---
Stormwind is a city with stone walls, a castle (complete with a drawbridge and moat), a harbor and a cathedral. They ride horses and tend to farms. Their soldiers are knights in plate armour.
---
The only other vaguely relatable race are the Dwarves, but their capital is in a mountain filled with lava and a giant anvil.
---
That's not mentioning the similar looks.
---
Yeah one of the reasons im not playing warlock, all my friends will be ally and the fear immunity skill is just a pain.
---
No matter how much evidence I could dig up, people would dispute it. Fastest levelling only counts in live Blizzard servers. 
---
The Classic Dev team has been good so far with their communication. Don't misunderstand. But they're competing against over a decade of bad faith from Blizzard as a whole. And while the Classic Dev team might know how bad sharding is, the higher ups who control what they do might not, or might not care, they only care about the bottom line, as evidenced by the decline of retail over years of casual friendly decisions. They don't care about the hardcore players, they care about casuals, since that's a bigger target market. And with BFA becoming unappealing even to casuals, it won't take much convincing for them to force their next WoW cash cow, Classic, to pander to that target market as well.
---
It's not blind mistrust. Its built up from over a decade of them destroying the game we all loved, where the only redeemable aspects over the years were actual raid mechanics and clothing design for transmog...basically everything else about the game has been garbage since the introduction of LFD. 
---
And yeah, I don't actually have an issue with sharding in the 1-12 zones for the first week or two at launch either. The issue I have with it is that because I can't trust blizzard, I would rather not have the precedent of having sharding be in the game to begin with. It's a lot harder for them to justify adding it in at a later date if it wasn't there from the start. Compound that with them still not having given us exact details regarding how and when they plan to use it and yeah, it's a serious problem.
---
The big pservers went to 25g max respec cost and that seems to have been a good middle ground.

Since we'll be getting CRBG they're all pretty equivalent.

---
There won’t be much game to play yet my friend
---
I’m going to start stockpiling mats shortly after reaching 60 for Lionheart Helm. You better believe when I finally pay to have it crafted I’m going to be over the moon. These items aren’t just something you can pickup in a day unless you buy gold. Everything in classic takes longer. It took a month for me to get pre bis gear for my warrior on actual classic I won’t even have a full pre bis before hopefully starting MC. But I’m still going to try and get drops while I can. In fact dungeons like I rs require people to make a key to access it so a fresh 60 at launch isn’t going to be done with their pbis before heavy raiding starts. 
---
You are mistaken, huge swathes of tourists would mean empty servers when they leave. They are not expected to get beyond the early zones hence why only those are likely to be sharded. I they didn't those tourists would tag the servers as full or high pop spreading the stable population too thin. Though I guess it depends on how many servers they open on total. They could all be full
---
I first started playing on a PVE server on my initial character because I had no interest in getting ganked while trying to level. While relaxing to play at my pace and log in if I had a few minutes here and there it was boring and solitary if my friends weren’t on. 
---
I started new on a PVP server and boy was I terrible. I was a keyboard turning clicker. But the PVP made me a better player and there’s nothing like teaming up with strangers to kill enemy players to bring you together. I still have people I keep in touch with on Facebook that I met in the game on that PvP server that we grinded through the ranks and quested together. 
---
My advice is play with your friends. PVP is awesome and you’ll have a lot more laughs despite the corpse runs.

Neck - Pendant of Celerity drops from t0.5 boss who will not be available at the beginning of the game. If you're going to mention this then you might as well mention Tarnished Elven Ring which is similarly poorly itemized and similarly unavailable at the start.
---
Chest - savage gladiator chain is BIS (assuming 1.10 version). It's also a hell of a lot easier to get than Breastplate of Bloodthirst.
---
weapon enchants, always use Crusader, it's a PPM enchant so the offhand weapon speed doesn't matter
---
You should have only mentioned 40% chance to glancing because level 63 bosses are the only thing anyone really cares about. Saying 20% just confuses people.
---
I consider Onyxia part of the whole Defias business, and Blackrock mountain is the midpoint between Stormwind and Ironforge, so I would put BWL as a good meeting point as a matter of the dwarves arriving via Dark Iron interests and the Humans from Onyxia follow up.  NO ONE likes the old horde camping out in that mountain, and the only reason they lasted as long as they did was their vassalage to Nefarion.  
---
This, except I want the Mottled Red Raptor instead, since there's still no good replacement for it on retail, unlike the Ivory, which has the Bone White Primal Raptor.
---
The decision between Classic and BFA comes down to a simple choice:
---
Get busy gaming... Or get busy paying microtransactions. 
---
They certainly did not confirm it then.
---
Did full progression as a Warrior offtank last year on a server so I think I can offer some insight. 
---
MC bosses actually utilize multiple tanks a lot due to most of them coming with secondary mobs, the only solo tank fights are Baron Geddon and Magmadar. Everything else either has "adds" or mechanics that require or work best with multiple tanks prior to overgearing. As far as trash packs go, there are quite a few single tank and quite a few multi tank packs, not sure on the distribution but I would say it leans more towards multi tank prior to overgearing.
---
BWL bosses utilize multiple tanks quite a bit but here they lean more towards two tanks where MC usually leaned towards 3 tanks or more. The first boss uses 4 tanks, the second boss varies depending on gear but early on will be 3 tanks most likely, just a dps race. Broodlord uses 2-3 tanks due to aggro wipes. The three drakes all use 2-3 tanks. Chrommagus is a 1 tank fight outside of timelapse weeks where it becomes a 2 tank fight with the offtank taking the boss during timelapses into the holding area. Neferian uses 4 tanks in phase 1 and only 1 tank in the rest of the fight except for when the adds killed in phase one a ressurected, then the other tanks will tank those until they're killed which isn't very long. All fights where I said 2-3 tanks, the 3rd tank is a safety net and should not be used except in cases of failure/tank death and are actually unneeded to complete the fight.
---
AQ40 is a really fun raid and also uses multiple tanks. This is also the first of the raids where the line between main tank and off tank becomes faded. The first boss, Skeram, will use 8 tanks for 2 on each of the 4 platforms. Fankriss will use 3-4 tanks depending on strat with 2 for boss and 1 for each add type. Bug tri will be 3-4 tanks depending on confidence. Visc will be one tank and a lot of engineering bombs. Sartura will use 5 tanks, 1 for each add and 2 for the boss. Huhuran will use 2 tanks due to aggro based tank swaps on poison stacks. Twin Emps uses 2 tanks for teleport separation. Ouro uses 3-4 tanks due to aggro wipes. This boss kinda sucks. C'thun will use 2 tanks for adds.
---
Naxx doesn't really have a main tank/offtank differentiator other than some bosses being solo tanked. There are too many bosses here for me to really want to type out how they're used in a basic sense so i'll just saw which only use one tank. Sapphiron, Loatheb, Heigan the unclean, Grobbulus, and Anub'rekhan. Interestingly, Naxx has the most solo tank bosses but also requires the most geared tanks.
---
The people saying 17% are wrong. Its 27-28% (The exact number being contested because of fractions of % being problematic in vanilla.
---
I always avoid playing a human if I can, but I don't have much of a choice for my main because I'm going to play a paladin, and I can't stand the dwarf animations.

I try this time to avoid Raids with DKP Systems.
---
I hate that system. DKP is just tedious. People with 1k DKP bidding on Items with 5 DKP steps... it takes forever and I just want to Raid.
---
Hopefully there will be a guild with a loot council on my server.
---
From skåne actually ^^
---
Keep telling yourself that, you can seek comfort with the people who still think they might get 1.5 AV.
---
These microtransactions are funny. First you hate 'em, then you get used to 'em. Enough time passes, gets so you depend on them. That's institutionalized. They send you here for the game, that's exactly what they take. The part that counts, anyways.
---
As Alliance clearly Teldrassil, even though it has that horrible Deathtrap-Cave. 
---
Cool your jets, turbo.
---
And it's not always as "easy" to fix an issue as it might be in a game. If you mess up something in history and it goes unnoticed, that could take a significant time to undo the damage, if you even can. I deal with this constantly. I'm still fixing issues caused by the current release and we are about to release the next version. It's hell.
---
Av is confirmed recently. Crbg has so wtf u talking about
---
Honestly they should just keep the old system with 1000g mount prices. It's better for the server long term as it helps combat inflation.
---
Yeah but what does the DKP system do to handle inflation for new guys that join a guild?  Not only will vets have more DKP to spend, but the amount they spend on any given item will creep up over time, screwing over the new guys.
---
And as guilds need to constant recruit, how does DKP inflation then work?
---
This gets a downvote for now.
---
A - for effort.
---
F - for execution.

I'm glad to find others with my same subscription pattern. I've stayed in BFA longer than I did Mop WoD or Legion, but its mostly because I found a good guild to hang out with. It helps
---
Well, it *had* to be him, considering his controversial statement.
---
With no RDF / raidfinder, no visible ilvl, no questfinder helper or whatever its called, and hard leveling (ie, an elite same lvl mob should push you hard, 3+ mobs should be a wipe or serious threat for most classes)... I would probably play this so much that I'd get divorced. 
---
Honestly all 3 shaman specs were powerful in PVP. Enhancement is very gear dependent though, so unless you’re decked out to the nines it’s unlikely anyone will seek you out proactively. 
---
But yes 30/0/21 will work just fine. 
---
You are supposed to die intentionally at certain points if you are speedrunning to 60
---
&gt;Do not overestimate the time it will take to level and make gold.
---
100g is the cost of regular 60%. You will earn around 300g from 1-60 by being careful with spending.
---
I'm 19, and I'm so excited to be a part of this. I've been playing on a pserver with my best friend and my girlfriend for about a month and a half, and it's been genuinely magical. It just feels like an *adventure*. So many fun moments have already happened (barrens chat had some real homies).
---
IDK if I'm really "young" I guess, but I don't know, I think I would've been just as into it a few years ago. Just gushing 'cause I'm excited.
---
My issue is that PvP servers dictate where you can play and when. For example, Stranglethorn Vale is one of my favorite areas and I love leveling there 30-40ish. However, when I played PvP servers, I had to avoid STV entirely, as I would get ganked every few minutes trying to run around. I don't want to have to log in in the middle of the night to play in a zone I love.
---
I understand the pros and cons of each, and I'm still considering just going to PvP, but I think there's a good chance I just stop playing when I have to deal with finding a place to hide and grind to level rather than playing in the most fun areas.
---
Theoretical Physics are Theoretical you corn cob.
---
Lol yeah it is. He was only sending worthless items. That is what separates a scam from a lottery ticket. You can actually win something.
---
It depends on cross realm battlegrounds which they have neither confirmed nor denied.  If CRBG is implemented I would expect the following:
---
1) Insta queue AV for horde and maybe a 25% win rate
---
2) Insta queue for alliance on AB and maybe 40% win rate
---
3) Queues varying for WSG with closer to 50-50 win rate
---
If CRBG is not implemented
---
PvE:
---
Horde insta queue everything because the pop will likely be 60-40 in favor of alliance 
---
PvP:
---
Even though alliance/horde pops are even queues will normally be on the horde side as they tend to have more PvP focused players.  I’d expect queues on horde side for everything but AV most of the time.
---
I remember playing Warcraft 1 on a laptop thicker than my head
---
I'm guessing they will all be high pop at launch.  I think its going to be a crap shoot which are healthy in the long run.  Blizzard will likely need to do some merging of servers.
---
And in doing so they'll be repeating the selfsame mistake that kneecapped the popularity of RPvP and led to the perception of it being such a niche community in the first place.
---
By the time RPvP realms were released the game had been out for nearly a year, meaning most of those who might have been interested in rolling on such a server had instead invested that time into leveling characters and establishing themselves among communities on other servers. Sure, some made the jump, but I guarantee at least as many decided it wasn't worth sacrificing all that.
---
I'm tired of being treated like a redheaded stepchild by Blizzard, especially when it's their own damn fault we look like such in the first place. Give us just *one* RPvP realm in each major region at launch. Let us prove, right out the gate, there's enough demand for it to justify adding more.
---
If they do this, I guaran-goddamn-tee you the folks at Blizzard will be blown the fuck away by how popular a choice it is. I'm not saying it will eclipse normal PvE or PvP servers, but it I'm certain it will be at least as popular as regular RP.
---
And if I'm wrong I'll link back to these posts, eat my crow and shut up about it for good and all.
---
So, 40 people zoning out/rolling up around a corner, mages spamming arcane explosion, to wipe the group that's summoning outside the raid?
---
IT's not that much server stress when the defenders aren't even meaningfully fighting back.
---
Thats kind of what i was assuming. Thanks for the info!!

Same, now I've got an urge to rewatch
---
I love how it looks and with the tier1 too
---
but then you realise you play a priest :(
---
I'm glad to know we'll never be harassed by grievously harmful names like &gt;!Tirdburglar.!&lt;
---
Im confused.  What got removed?
---
&gt; the actual gameplay is very lackluster and he could've done so much more to minmax speed, like kiting, doubleattacking(using both melee and bow at same time), autolooting etc. A lot of credit to the guy of course because he played very well for someone 14 years ago
---
There's a reason it was a meme among PvPers that people who raided and mainly did PvE were absolutely terrible at the game.
---
I followed Joana's guide in BC and was surprised at just how great it was. I was also really impressed with the 4 days 20 hours time given that he was the highest level on the server and didn't have access to anything that could have helped him level. But watching the gameplay of his speedrun was a huuuge yikes. Going to be a lot of fun to watch his next speedrun and see just how much the guy must have improved though.
---
i guess you don't play MMOs, much less vanilla WoW
---
Well other than blizzard using 1.12 which of course has CRBG's in it.
---
I'd probably go mad if I tried to hamstring kite everything. I plan on doing it close to 0 times. Only if i get near death or something.
---
Yes I hear you, I was the same way. PVP servers dictate that you never play alone. If you want to do STV find a friend or guildmates. If you try playing solo you’re gonna have a bad time. 
---
It’s been 15 years and I still remember the night myself (human priest) and my brother(night elf warrior) fought 2 troll rogues over and over for 3+ hours in STV. We got nothing done and kept our head on a swivel the entire night attempting to quest but we still joke about it to this day.  So naturally I’m a big advocate for PVP servers. 
---
July 28th, tag it and bag it sir 👌🏼
---
7 Phases.
---
Phase 1: Only up to level 20. Then the rest.
---
Just so we can start NOW!
---
This thread REALLY goes to show just how well Blizzard absolutely nailed each starting zone. Like, I'll be honest, the worst part about playing undead to me is the idea of running around a depressing as hell zone as Tirisfall glades, and yet some people love it! Meanwhile, I'm a huge fan of the verdant grasslands of Mulgore, the rolling plains and in the center of it all the beautiful city of Thunder Bluff... But some people apparently are hating on it, and you know what? That's cool too. 
---
did u have epic mount for that
---
Doesnt 1.12 have zg bwl etc...   They wont be in at launch
---
Your post because it is a Google-able question. Dual spec will not be in the game.
---
horde on a pve server
---
So what you're saying is that CRBG will just be time gated gotcha.
---
Most proper PvP items aren't good for PvE fury warriors either. There are a few exceptions, but for the most part you want plate with high stamina for PvP, and that's not what most BIS fury pieces are. But you also don't want defense skill which isn't that great for PVP.
---
However there are certain BIS PVP items that are also BIS PVE and should be assigned to their specific roles. T2.5 should be tank prio because yes, TPS. The exception in our guild was to give shoulders to fury first, however 2.5 tokens are very common and eventually every warrior got their full set. Other tank prio, but also good for PVP, items include: Bracers of Wrath, Archimtiros' Ring of Reckoning, Lifegiving Gem
---
Fury prio BIS PVP+PVE items: Onslaught Girdle, Chromatic Boots, Gauntlets of Annihilation
---
Two handers were considered off spec for everyone and assigned as a "reward" item based on attendance reliability, performance, or whatever
---
wait a bit to check what the main 4chan servers are
---
then play on any other 
---
hdmi - only way, sorry :(
---
You'll be fine, it's just less efficient and means you'll take more damage per mob. If anything, hamstring kiting won't be nearly as useful in Classic if the AI stays as [it was during the Demo.](https://clips.twitch.tv/PiliableHonestMoonCharlietheUnicorn)
---
Yeah, I changed guild for that attitude. The moment I sent them the dps chart at a respectable 4th place with my new guild has been a highlight of my vanilla time.
---
&gt;died 20 times
---
What in the fuck. His old wr had only one unintentional death.
---
I wonder if more of those deaths were intentional...
---
It doesn’t necessarily mean everything in the game in 1.12 will be at launch. Cross realms were for low pop servers, there shouldn’t be any long queue times on these new servers for a while. 
---
I predict a late June early July release to compete with Final Fantasy.
---
This is a c c c combo due to the feeling of the game dying, and this sad mother fucking scene 
---
That doesn't prevent you from engaging in world pvp. Anyone who is farming honor should be in instanced BGs where their HKs are suitably protected from the actions of other pvp'ers.
---
Probably not a coincidence that DKs and BGs were released in the same patch.
---
For warriors and rogues there's the juicy weapon skill bonuses. For every other class there's awesome rep bonuses.
---
For RP, I guess it's fun to be something closer to your real self for the sake of immersion.
---
If someone quits world pvp because a civilian got tagged, then they weren't there for the pvp

Call it whatever you want, but it just CAN'T look like this:

While I hope they keep it in, they have shown that they listen to the community and many people do not want it. There's no reason to be an ass about this. It literally is not confirmed. 
---
I agree that Tirisfal Glades is the best developed of the horde starting zones.

Easier to launch without marketing or release date when you're free to play tho
---
I'm totally fine if they want to try to prioritize same realm matches as long as it doesn't impact queue times.
---
That's lame.  For new folks, its a completely valid question and was a two part question about how to handle different specs if dual speccing isnt an option.  
---
1. Content must be related to WoW: Classic
---
2. Be Civil and Respectful
---
3. No witch hunts or brigading
---
4. Don't share how to cheat
---
5. No real world politics or religion.
---
6. Flag NSFW content
---
7. Avoid Reposts
---
8. Avoid Misinformation
---
9. Do not create posts with Google-able questions...............
---
I remember in bc or wotlk they had those "casinos" but I think blizzard started banning players who were doing that.
---
I'd roll Human for +Weapon Skill and the reputation bonus. My 2nd option would be Dwarf for Stoneform.
---
I just can't roll Gnome for warrior. The escape artist is a really good pvp racial. I just can't get over being some tiny fuck and also being some supreme melee warrior at the same time.
---
Why would I want to cure a zombie apocalypse? That's every nerd's time to shine.
---
Earning a piece of gear that means something. Being a hunter with Rhok is an instant way of saying "I'm good at my class", I froth that sort of stuff!
---
You can buy and drink any potion without being an Alchemist.
---
You can't use the best engineering items without being an Engineer.
---
Rogues vanishing death coil, or any other projectile, is not a better example because it's possible without spell batching and just has to do with the spell priority system. If you want to give a better example, take two instant spells like vanish and blind. But I explicit wrote that my example is aimed at casuals, something they can relate to and is prone to happen naturally. 
---
PVE exists.
---
find new friends man discord is the place to be 
---
Good content is what I like to see
---
I grinded to Rank 14 on alliance and all 3 warlocks we rolled with were humans. Sure wotf is annoying but geez perception just embarrasses rogues. 
---
Play whatever appeals to you most man, the race doesn’t matter nearly as much as people think. 
---
I don't have time to respond to every whine blustered by the horde of groupthink PS jockeys outraged at the mere suggestion that a world record time for leveling isn't official unless it occurs on official servers.
---
Because, you know, common sense.
---
Anyone know if this website gets updated?: [https://realmpop.com/us.html](https://realmpop.com/us.html)
---
Same here lol. I saw a twitch stream of it a while ago and was taken aback by it. 
---
Don't get me wrong, back in 2006 I was TERRIBLE at this game myself, and the skill ceiling on hunter rotations wasn't really understood back in Vanilla, so it makes sense, but the comparison to the average gamer today is jarring. 
---
Yeah if they nail faction balance it will be a thing of beauty. 
---
You are going to absolutely love this game. Been playing the last few weeks on a private server and it is just such a great game.
---
I actually bought a subwoofer to fully emerge into the sound/environment. Now I can feel every attack and spell :D
---
Of course.  I was also a mage, which allowed me to complete my Black Lotus rounds in about an hour, and right around their respawn timer.  
---
You just like being a pedantic asshole for no reason.
---
Everyone is getting downvoted in this thread and now I don't know who to believe. It sure looks free on his website...
---
What about ShaguPlates (it shows enemy cast bars underneath their nameplate over their heads in the world) ? I love this feature, very useful in battlegrounds.
---
Gnomes, man. Copperfield did nothing wrong.
---
I loved the effort that went into organizing a group, getting to the dungeon, and fighting our way to the end. Specifically Blackfathom Deeps and searching for Old Serrakis stands out. 
---
I try to ignore the unnumbered times that groups failed to organize, failed to get to the dungeon or failed to fight to the end. 
---
I do understand that it somehow converted hardcore pvp'ers into whiny little bitches who would cry and rage quit as soon as an enemy civilian was killed in world pvp.
---
it's both hilarious and pathetic. Their tears generate no sympathy from me.
---
Im.moving in june and wont have new pc setup till july.
---
Im fine with jy
---
I don't see how the OP saying they personally find pre 1.4 mounts more important than spell batching immediately means that the OP is shitting on spell batching or is "making it a hill to die on".
---
You're the only one being dramatic here, overreacting to the OP's post.
---
Is that the way it works in modern wow? This is bannable now?
---
On my server the big spot was on top of the building in Silithus
---
I was server first herbalist 3 times (lk/cata/mists) in a row.
---
I knew it’s was the only server first I was gonna get.
---
We are going to  need a higher cap if we want to recreate an authentic Vanilla experience. Most of the people who will be playing are old and have jobs and kids. They can only be on a few hours per week. So two things are true:
---
1. We will need more total people on the server.
---
2. We will need to be able to accommodate a larger peak in concurrent online players if they happen to want to log in at the same time. 
---
Honestly if the cap were set to 10k that would be just fine. Most people aren't going to be the super hardcore types that are on all day. They'll just want to be able to log on for a few hours without hitting a Queue.
---
once I did read about controllers that worked with face movements. I don't think they've succeeded. Too bad because you could bind every face muscle to a skill ..............
---
Tauren, 5% HP tank master race baby. Warstomp can be useful as well.
---
World pvp, without flying mounts and cross server characters I've never seen before and will probably never see again. Remember seeing someone in STV at 30 then again in tanaris at 40 then again in like WPL at 50ish.. it made the world feel real seeing the same people level up along side you whether on your own or opposing faction. Friendships and rivalries are born this way. 
---
Wasn't there a poll a few month ago about which kind of server ppl were looking to play in ?
---
You’ll actually get passed up on more wraps DUE to being a human. I haven’t been allowed to roll on any axes, fist weapons, daggers while raiding as human, (or when I do roll+win I get passed up anyway) meanwhile nelves and gnomes can roll on swords all they want.
---
Inb4 “gquit”
---
The question is if Tauren will actually get increased melee range on Classic
---
You can do whatever you want. Just not in my raid.
---
There's something about contrasting the normalcy of your character with the fantasy of their surroundings. It mirrors the feeling of immersing yourself as a normal human in a fantastic story. Like Harry Potter living a normal life before finding out he's a wizard. 
---
The good thing about classic is that it will have better chances making new friends. I have a similar issue but thinking back I made a lot of friends leveling. I’m sure I’ll do fine now.
---
The problem is, you’re taking what u/gauntz is trying to say and taking it to a different subject. We are talking about rotations. Nothing else. It is 100%, objectively confirmed, that vanilla rotations aren’t as complicated as retail. Purely looking at average keys pressed during a rotation. 
---
Now if you begin to factor in other things, such as positioning, mana/rage management and timings and other very nuanced subjects, you can begin to debate the difficulty of most vanilla rotations. So again, focus on what he is saying rather than adding extra things. 
---
You're right, it's not like wotf is on a 10 second cooldown, they wont have it up all the time. 
---
You can be Arms/Prot and can tank virtually anything short of AQ40/Naxx with the right gear.
---
Now I wanna know what "Keystones" are?
---
getting camped when u farm for PVE also exists
---
its a pain to make money with or solo mobs like if u need for rep
---
late but https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqdaJbHrWgI
---
Actually using CC in dungeons and communicating with your party so  these are the things that imo make classic more than just grinding mobs in the open world. There’s a magical feeling being a level 18 noob and learning oh shit polymorphous useful. As for mechanics I don’t find the affixes from M+ FUN. They felt tedious and also the rewards system with titan forging really trivializes loot and makes it all feel pointless. 
---
This is going to sound really far fetched, but I imagine a future maybe 20-25 years from now where virtual reality and procedural generation are good enough that I can visit places like Mulgore, maybe reimagined with textures and lighting, and just sit in the field and watch the world around me.
---
BfA and BoA are not the same thing
---
I was once farming fused wiring in STV on my 60 warrior (mt).  Had basically any piece of gear could want on that toon.  Anyways I’m farming and a raid (30 or so) of lowbies (25-45) comes runnin through and decide they can kill me.  Was such a fun fight.  Charging/intercepting back and forth.  Popping potions/reckoning. Anyways ended up killing them all multiple times till they decided to give up.    
---
Man I love vanilla.
---
Bear tanks:
---
Highly viable throughout any content in Vanilla, but falling off considerably during certain intervals.
---
Takes more damage than warrior tanks especially Tier 2 (BWL) and Tier 3 (Naxx), which are far superior.
---
Cannot produce more threat than Thunderfury (TF) or DW tanking, thus limited to an OT role moving forward.
---
Has little utility due to very poor dps in comparison to an OT fury, fury prot, or Impale spec Nightfall warrior.
---
Early MC you can shine. BWL fall off due to TF and Tier 2 released. Good feral gear in AQ but warrior OT's win out overall in raid efficiency moving forward. Naxxramas - don't have a raid spot for you because the gap is far too large.
---
Short Answer: If your raid group is smart, they will never let you dps. It's bad and warrior OT can outshine you easily.
---
In casual guilds, you can find a spot but in hardcore guilds - bear tanks aren't welcome.
---
I should be more specific. Rag kill won't happen before dm or pvp gear or other catch up system during pug raid. And when I say pug I mean 5-10 guildies building pug. Not 20+ guildies that needs some scrubs from /4
---
Apples and oranges.  Battlegrounds already use a queue system where you click on an NPC or walk into a portal and it puts you with 9-39 strangers, and when you’re done you have no obligation to them anymore.  Does it matter that much if people are on your server or not?  Is it going to stop that AFK honor farmer in the GY because you will see him in the world.  My memory is that it didn’t.
---
If you want a true experience so that BGs are similar to dungeons then shouldn’t everyone be obligated to spam general/trade/world to get a full group before going to the AB portal and playing?  They would also have to spam some cross faction “looking for opponents” to find another full group to play against because all queues are inherently bad.  Fundamentally the argument that CRBG = LFD falls apart.  Even when isolated to a single server there is a certain amount of anonymity due to the nature of queues.
---
Would you say human would be better for pvp than gnome? I was planning on rolling gnome for the int, engineering, and escape artist, is perception really that powerful for stealthies? 
---
I fell in love with the night elves in WC3 and Teldrassil was pure magic. It nailed the athmosphere perfectly.
---
That's definitely it! Thanks man!
---
Well to be fair if a raid did that you would just switch the shaman into the group of healers, drop the totem for 12 seconds or w.e, then switch them back. Better than losing healers.
---
I would be happy to have one field with one herb node in southern barrens where to run wild and pick up same silverleaf again &amp; again.
---
It's covered under rule 7. See the guidelines for more info. Your question has also been posted numerous times.
---
Either is fine, both can opt into the lashers farm. Prot paladin is a very efficient farm spec, but you need to either go for a hybrid holy/prot build for one size fits all at endgame, or you'll need to respec fairly frequently, which you need to take into account in your farms. You can easily make up the GPM for it by AoE farming, but it can be rough if you don't have the ability to 
---
I'd be looking at a 20/31/0 build for farming while keeping the capacity to heal. You can tank or heal 5 and 10 man dungeons, you can potentially PvP with this spec, and it's honestly not the worst spec in the world for raiding. You get most of the necessities from Holy, so you're a pretty effective healer, and you provide blessing of sanctuary, so it's honestly not bad, even in raid. Retribution Aura, Blessing of Sanctuary, Holy Shield, and Consecration make AoE farming a fucking breeze. In raid you have solid, but not optimized, healing, and can throw on a shield to offtank whenever your raid needs. 
---
I'm not an expert on priest. I can't really compare the two. Depends on the PvP specs you want to play. 
---
You have it backward. Multiboxing is allowed on live as long as you pay for all the accounts. It's banned on most private servers.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cocqJ45P0Uc
---
Not 100% sure if you're asking for a modern alternative that we can hope will get ported or if you're asking if Shagu plans to port ShaguPlates. 
---
As far as whether or not he plans to port it, you'd have to go look on his website or contact him.  I have no idea, but I was under the impression that he was not planning on porting anything.  I could be *wildly* mistaken about that.
---
As far as what are other alternatives on the modern client ElvUI's nameplates do that.  To be clear: As far as I'm aware, there is *no* functionality that pfUI has that ElvUI does not; however, there is a *huge* amount of functionality and customization that ElvUI has that pfUI does not.  Part of this is because of the addon API differences between versions.
---
Personally on live I use ElvUI, but swap in Shadowed Unit Frames instead of Elv's unit frames.  I'm hoping to do something similar on classic.
---
Bumping bass for wow sounds new meta 
---
Can you quote exactly where I said that it was a world record or that it was exactly comparable to retail? Way to avoid backing up your arguments, mate. You really convinced me that private servers give zero indication of the possibilities of classic.
---
oh god what the fuck are these 2-hander recommendations and enchants.
---
No in my dreams I am always the ganker lol.
---
I think horde as a faction is a lot more interesting to play, but humans are generic fantasy which a lot of players enjoy. Their casting animations are pretty good though. 
---
It's more likely they talked about whether how many people wanted vanilla servers and to what extend (would they be ready to pay for it i guess ?) than how to host the server...
---
I mean you can hardly teach people how to do what they created 
---
That login screen man...
---
It's a fresh launch, you will have hundreds of classic people around you 24/7 while leveling. Just group up with someone for a few quests and they might stick around, if they plan on playing for 6+ hours or whatever that day then ask the person if they want to team up for the rest of the day. It's so easy to find people to play with on a fresh launch.
---
I have only played solo on one launch before but during that launch I found a person to play with for 12 hours straight just by asking him if he wants to do some quests together for easier progression. We even picked up a few people along the way that sticked around for a few hours each before heading off to bed or a dungeon. Just talk to people while leveling (which you should) and you will enjoy your time even without close friends.
---
I kinda find it weird how blizzard isn't planning to add an RPPVP server in the first place, since they were already in vanilla. Seems odd, no?
---
So, please nobody attack me for this, but what's the reason that classic has taken years to be developed? I understand that there are certain, erm, underhanded ways of playing vanilla WoW where an old version of the game is running just fine. Obviously the scale would be huge in comparison, but couldn't they just release an old version of the game, and then work on these updated phases while we all happily level the days away?
---
Really just wondering if it's possible on the current API to detect enemy spellcast and attach the castbar to their overhead nameplate.
---
I honestly hope that there aren't a ton of servers.  
---
Nothing is more depressing than seeing a huge list of servers and having 75% of them showing low population.
---
Vanishing death coil is *much* easier with spell batching, because you have a much bigger window to do so in. Death coil is also an instant-cast spell, and you can generally predict it will be used when the warlock leaves stun/their shadow is unlocked.
---
Hammer of Justice is a terrible example, because you generally can't predict when a paladin will stun you. There's no particular play, or counterplay with it, that spell batching *enables*.
---
All it does is produce slightly different results (If the HOJ is late).
---
Agreed. Consistent 5k is a good balance. Maybe a 6.5k cap would be good. 
---
250 hours here. Might be pushing 300 by the time Classic's out.
---
My wife knows 100% why I'll be completely vacant for a week. I'll be around to help out an hour in the morning like normal to help out with the kiddo, but she's going to daycare like normal. I'll help out more 6-8 or so when they're back and prior to bed, but the other 21 hours of the day are mine that week.
---
Can we just kill boats to 60?
---
Hey Ythisens, do you know anything about the team's thoughts on RP-PvP servers? :(
---
That’s simply not true. If your spells are being resisted you’re not doing DPS. The same concept applies to weapon skill being so highly sought after by warriors and rogues. I’ll put together a list of what I look for, but I would definitely sacrifice a bit of spellpower for hit. In the case of boots, those two are a much tougher choice for me, but depending on how much spell power I have on other gear I might choose the hit. 
---
There was a patch where they changed the behavior, but I don't remember which way or what patch number.
---
I ain't ready dog, I still cant decide on a class. 
---
Perception is indeed very powerful. Combined with paranoia from your dog you’ll laugh at rogues. However, escape artist is also one of the best pvp racials. That’s why I said play whatever you like most because in the end it all balances out. 
---
Unless you’re a troll, they just look stupid and their racials are bad haha. 
---
Pick the pvp server with the best name lol. And hope for the best!
---
The simplest solution will be hdmi to the tv (wireless HDMI exists but a long cable would be much cheaper) and Bluetooth mouse and keyboard (long range Bluetooth receivers exist, but a short range receiver on a long cord is cheaper).
---
Alternatively, if you want to try making a controller work then the Steam Link and Steam Controller were designed for exactly that purpose. That setup will require a lot of tinkering but I have no doubt you can Google and find people that have done it for retail WoW.
---
The sound I miss the most are the rain drops. Vanilla had such an awesome weather system.
---
"Are you a girl IRL?"
---
Spoiler alert?
---
Cant wait for original sunken temple
---
Tldr
---
Those people sound like they're the type who just like to complain for the sake of complaining. Those types of people generally don't have anything worthwhile to contribute but they think by being contrarian they'll sound smart.
---
Don't let them bring you down. When Classic starts there will be plenty of people playing so tons of people to group with and play with as you level. Just don't be afraid to say hi to people when you see them around the world. It's going to be boat loads of fun.
---
no worries I was looking for it myself too haha
---
now my next look is another human female video this time it was a GM arms warrior with lots of in flames songs
---
If fear ward is so critical, how does the Horde ever make any progress?
---
I'm really hoping for optional BC servers after Classic, as someone who came at the start of Wrath I feel like I missed out on so much. 
---
I’ve met people in real life that I met only online in classic. Who cares if your friends don’t want to play with you, you’ll make new ones. 
---
Same. Loved ZF so much.
---
Assuming there's an RP-PvP server, and I assume there is, I will roll there. If there's more than one I'll roll a dice.
---
If Blizzard suddenly has a stroke and decides not to, RP, roll a dice.
---
I used to play on a medium populated server in Vanilla-TBC (Aggrammar EU), and I don't recall ever being starved for choices and opportunities. Economy was fairly ok as well.
---
Dude that’s the best part! You’re this super tiny gnome pummeling huge tauren’s faces in, it’s the best. 
---
You don't need to have all pre-BIS, but your gear needs to show that you are making an effort to get the right stuff, and that you understand your stat priorities.
---
Scrap the PvP ranking system and come up with something better. Not only is it an objectively terrible system, it implicitly incentivizes unhealthy behaviors and unethical styles of play.
---
And scrap dHKs while you're at it. They don't prevent or even deter griefing, the reason  for which they were ostensibly implemented in the first place, and they have a massive chilling effect on world PvP. One could well argue they actively punish city/faction leader raids.
---
Best post this forum has ever seen 
---
People tried to dox me and sent me death threats one time when I voiced the opinion that Woody Allen is a creep. 
---
8k+
---
you are right about the scaling up part but you need to take into account that bosses in MC have a different "hidden level" as bosses in NAXX for example i beleive mc bosses are 61 and naxx bosses 62 or 61 ... so as far as i was able to remember was the best weapon skill to have is around 310 after that it drastically falls off and before 310 no other stat gets closed to being as valuable as weapon skill
---
Keep the original numbers. That’s what I’d vote for.
---
I’ve always wondered why Tauren wasn’t picked as much. It seemed like warstomp would pair so nicely with a hunters toolkit. 
---
"skilled clicker" Pepega
---
WPvP in Black Rock mountain. Debating on going nelf priest just so I can shadowmeld there and throw the straggler of the raid group into the lava. 
---
Right, but at least once per fight wotf will be up, its only on a 2 minute cooldown.
---
JFC, this bang on. 
---
I know you started the thread so you are the exception but you can almost set your watch to couples being Ally. The horde had a distinct lack of women in vanilla. The only girls we get are the goth ladies. I guess our ugly ass character models didn't have the same appeal as elves.
---
It's the problem I am having right now in fact. I am horde through and through. Even the idea of being an ally makes my skin crawl. I learned to hate them. I can't go Ally. Yet my girl friend just keeps commenting on how cute those fucking night elves are... Blood elves where are you? Come and save me from this hell!
---
First player to have [Thekals Grasp](https://www.wowhead.com/item=19896/thekals-grasp) and [Arlokks Grasp](https://www.wowhead.com/item=19910/arlokks-grasp). I received many whispers about how I could turn into a tiger and whether I was cheating.
---
There was, and the results showed RPvP being nearly 4x as popular as regular RP servers, to the tune of something like 1800 responses.
---
Granted, an online poll of an enthusiast subreddit is hardly scientific data, but I think it's at least enough to demonstrate there is real interest in RPvP servers, and hopefully enough to convince Blizzard to give us a real chance this time 'round.
---
Wouldnt matter, i'd be hanging myself in the closet by my underwear before the punch line landed.
---
I hope so. There's a ton of planning revolving around that date, with deadlines approaching faster than the holy light.
---
Gummy is the truth, not some guy.
---
Who ever said classic would run on the same shards retail do ?
---
since they only plan to use sharding on launch then you don't need so many shards, which gives more ressources for the servers unless blizzard gives up on the cloud server they use and invest on hardware.
---
I don't think the cloud would be worse than the old hardware server, i mean most of the time you have a lag free experience on retail even in 15v15 bg. It does lag a lot on War Mode invasions (World PvP event on a zone) where hundreds of players rush to the same area.
---
Still managed to do a 40 vs 40  World PvP on retail without too much time (felt like less than 200 ping iir) so i don't think the servers are unable to deal with 80 players. 
---
Seems like something is messing up with the server which cause lags (too many people online or within the zone, which leaves less ressources avaible for each shard, or some gameplay system like dynamic respawn ect)
---
Vanilla use way less ressources too (iirc on retail each player can put about 25 debuff on a boss, so up to +500 debuffs max per boss.) so it should work.
---
Yeah warrior slow OH is only marginally better, but it's not enough to make a significant difference. It's far more important to pick an offhand that has good stats that buff your mainhand. Most of those offhands are unfortunately fast (Maladath, Anubisath Warhammer, Hungering Cold)
---
&gt; We haven’t yet determined exactly when phases 2-6 will occur, and PvP content is notably missing from the list above.
---
is the exact quote.  That doesn't say they've determined exactly when the game will release.  It just says that they haven't decided what the intervals will be.
---
me to my carpel tunnel: "We've felt pain before."
---
Should there be even 2000 fans per region then the server could work.
---
Never tried RP tho, how was it like compared to pve or PvP ?
---
You will have to wait until the server settles down on the ratio. But i guess choosing alliance is a good choice, because i think horde is always more pvp oriented so ally gets quicker queue.
---
Did that simulation include instant attacks (bloodthirst, overpower, and hamstring)?
---
I’m looking forward to farming herbs late at night or early in the morning and feeling like I’m out there while everyone else sleeps .
---
I answer that above:  ElvUI's nameplates do that already.  So, in short, yes at least for the current live game.
---
burning crusade videos posted in classicwow reddit? i think you are wrong here mate sorry \^\^ and the bad quality around tbc times is not really excusable :P there is tons of tbc videos out there with perfect quality
---
The key is to pick the server with the most reconizable name in the lore.
---
Just literally be the talkative guy and the introverts will say inv. 
---
Pvp: horde
---
Pve: alliance
---
Having your fear negated sucks in pvp but you can work around it, and in horde you aren't getting a raid spot so easily. Either way if you love being a warlock you'll be fine!
---
&gt;Your first post was downvoted because it was nonsense and false
---
Really? Where was it false?  Because I'm \*pretty\* sure I'm correct.  If you use more resources (i.e mana/rage/cooldowns/etc) and kill stuff faster; you take less damage.  I never said Hamstring kiting was bad, I just listed the cons (that many people often gloss over or overlook entirely).  
---
&gt; I find it really funny how you block people that disagree with you. Gotta love the irony of this comment 
---
I don't block people that disagree with me.  I block people that have a blatant disregard for using their fucking brains.  I'm not going to lower my IQ or attempt to explain simple things more than once, and if you can't grasp it beyond that, that's on you; not me.  No matter what kind of false logic or bullshit dissociation tactic you use to justify it.  
---
And as far as the downvotes (specifically) are concerned, I could give a shit.  You think I'm on here to make virtual friends? Only reason I even \*CARE\* about karma is just so I can post my opinion and not get flagged by the automoderator for having too low a karma score. Beyond that it's a bullshit number,  something that the only people who care about it are the same people who still care about their GamerScore on XBoxLive.
---
Considering you fall into the 2nd category I mentioned (people who can't be arsed to use your brain, and you've now made it known by vocalizing you can't use your brain.) you'll be joining that category in just a few seconds.  Enjoy!
---
Good post, thank you
---
Despite BFA not being the best expansion, playing wow as a complete newbie and jumping in is honestly one of the best experiences ever. Take your time, enjoy the world and just do what looks cool to you. Recognize that classic wow and modern wow is completely different, but as a new player you can enjoy both for different reasons and with having a subscription allowing you to play WoW up to level 110 and Classic for free when it comes out, it's a great experience.

Oh, when we’re talking Warlock alts, it’s usually for World Bosses.

I mean... Why ?
---
While it would be fun to have the gore quest items back, weren't the changes on AV well recieved even back in vanilla ?
---
See, as an adult now the problem is paying the monthly fee, as well as having $20 worth of booze for a raid night (I'm Canadian so $20 is like 10 decent beers)
---
There will likely be 0 functioning addons on release because it's not a version of WoW that has ever existed.
---
Well, they got added to vanilla a bit after launch. Best case scenario is that they implement them in launch of classic, good scenario would be them adding them a bit later. I would reroll instantly if there were no transfers. 
---
Male nelf priest would be ultimate cancer

---
They also get 60% mount for freeish
---
A fortune? Pray tell, which instances at what level? 
---
Yeah, I main a Prot Warrior, so I need several Force Reactive Disks for tanking. They need like 8 arcanite each so, it’ll take me a bit. 
---
I remember riding a mount in Felwood going to Winterspring stumbling on a horde character with a rival horde guild which had a name that was an obvious alt to one of their officers and biggest shit talkers on the servers (forums and IRC) well I ganked him and quickly he brought in reinforcements. I brought some in and we ended up doing a guild vs guild fight for 3-4 hours non stop which kept going on via the forums, via IRC and the world for months to come.
---
That's what I miss the most being able to trigger events which lead to drama and the same point creating a virtual story line which I/we control that is involving my/our gameplay. Modern WoW ain't got shit on this.
---
I played on Defias Brotherhood and remember it very fondly. Plenty of guildsx RPing and World PVP as well as battlegrounds PvP and raiding scene. if RP isn't really your thing then as long as you weren't OOC (out of character) in white chat (can't remember it's name) then no one really gave you a hard time. 
---
I don’t know, shoulders are a huge aesthetic piece for all armor sets, so it’d make sense to go with the massive shoulders of Tauren/Orc. Tauren head slot items on the other hand...
---
If Classic becomes a huge success Blizzard would be crazy not to capitalise on it somehow (possibly in all the wrong ways :P ).
---
That might be a big if though, Classic could be a bit niche now in the age of instant gratification. I hope it becomes big, and I myself will almost certainly enjoy it (I started halfway through TBC, so I also missed out on vanilla), but honestly I'm not holding my breath. 
---
Wherever the old PvP guilds from Archimonde are going. 
---
I wish I had friends. ESP friends like yours but I will eventually meet them in Azeroth lol. I for one can’t wait and the only friend I had that was interested past away in an accident. Ermic was his game name for everything and my character will be named in memory of my boy! 
---
See you soon
---
I play almost exclusively alliance and I voted Mulgore. No idea why it is so low.
---
It's more realistic too, training for something should be cheaper than buying the actual thing, like taking driving lessons vs buying multiple cars.. if immersion matters 
---
Ouch.
---
What does "female" have to do with these race/class combos?  Why are these "rare" or "obscure"?  Why would you run these if they are?
---
I was thinking this post would be more along the line of "would you roll a Night Elf Priest since dwarves are basically BIS and Humans at least get spirit."  
---
It was either very different or just like a normal server but with fewer obnoxious names, depending on how much you got into it. Being as I'm a huge nerd who plays and/or runs D&amp;D for a regular bi-weekly group, I had an absolute blast with it. It's a very different experience to tabletop, being as you have to work within the strictures of both the world and game mechanics, but that still leaves a lot of wiggle room if you're creative.
---
Also: found the [link] (https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9yt514/world_of_warcraft_classic_census_and_demographics/) to that survey post. Looks like I was mistaken about the numbers involved; it was 1200-something voting for RPvP. Still four times more than the votes for RP, though; and again, this is a fairly limited selection of those sufficiently interested in Classic to be frequenting a subreddit about it months before release.
---
Welcome to the club, I just hope you already know the differences.  
---
  Vanilla and wrath are already worlds apart in game design and if you're not ready for them you might be overwhelmed and/or bored, vanilla isn't for everyone.  
---
  And if you do, enjoy it because this goes far beyond playing a game, it's a full blown experience that can't be replicated.  
---
It did have an effect, I think one of the original wow devs that was a guest on Classicast said they walked into the office and set the petition that he had printed and bound on the desk of his old manager to convince him that this was something that had to be done 
---
Why tho ?
---
Retail community won't 100% welcome vanilla, and one could argue many things are better today than back in vanilla (class balance would be a good start). 
---
What could change tho (and i would gladly welcome it) would be to make the overall content harder rather than letting every 8yo win every encounter in open world. 
---
Some random mobs in bfa have more mecanics than some boss in vanilla, yet they are nerfed to the ground so that people don't sufer too much when they get hit.
---
Don't get me wrong : some vanilla concept would be awesome in retail, but i don't think classic being a success will lead devs to adopt them in retail.
---
I'm not spreading misinformation.  You weave skills (mostly ones off the GCD) in between auto-attacks.  If you're a warrior, generally speaking you can't do jack shit in between AA's since you'll be hamstring kiting and not in melee range.  If  you don't hamstring kite, you can auto, &lt;insert Off-GCD instant here&gt;, auto.  
---
I'm still fairly certain that there ARE attack reset skills in vanilla, but even if I'm 100% wrong in that regard, (again IF) that doesn't negate what I'm saying.  You're straw-manning a **singular part** of my argument in an attempt to refute the whole thing.  
---
The fact that I have to explicitly explain this to you, or that you couldn't f\*\*king discern it by using applied logic given the context of the conversation just further reinforces the fact that you don't know nearly as much as you \*think\* you know, and by talking to you my IQ has actually lowered.
---
Killing as many mages as I can on my warrior using an engineering net and bombs. 
---
Our premade classic 5 men group are 33-40 yo vanilla veterans :)
---
If you're picking up Mining, Herbalism or both, definitely go to Silverpine first for as long as you're able to squeeze XP out of the zone. There are infinitely more nodes of all types there. The Barrens is not friendly towards gathering professions other than Skinning.
---
I added female because have you ever seen a fully geared fem troll MT? Its just a funny image to me
---
Legion release date was announced in late April and came out late August, and BfA's release date was announced April 5th and it came out August 14th. We can all dream but I doubt very much Classic will come earlier than August.
---
August. There I said it. They consider August summer so they will do August. 
---
Doesn't grouping really drain your xp gains from mobs though? It's the only thought keeping me from doing this.
---
Same, I'm just going to pick which ever RP server has the coolest name and hope for the best. Even at worst case senario I pick a server that dies off fast within 3-4 months I'll just reroll, it would suck but it's not going to break me.
---
Eh you were always at the mercy of the raid leader in a pug anyways. You shouldn't join a pug without at least some reservation of what could happen.
---
Not disagreeing with you or anything, it's def gonna be a problem, but it seems like that's just gonna be how it is.
---
Warrior homer is thick as fuck.
---
Specifically because of how they have to sit in The middle of nowhere logged out, it's usually better that they're just lvl 20.
---
Hunters are faster to 35 so they're usually better crafting alts.
---
That place eats time. Honestly I’ll peobably run it for quest once. 
---
&gt;Fantastic advice at the end. I will wait for retail . THank you !
---
I played on one - Lightbringer, if I recall correctly.
---
It was completely indistinguishable from regular PvP servers.  RP was minimal.  Maybe a few more "themed" guilds, but they were always casual and they weren't common or big enough to affect the environment of the server at all.
---
If you took a guy and said "We're gonna let you play for an hour each on ten different servers.  After playing on all ten, tell us which ones were RP servers." -- he'd be completely guessing.  He would have no idea.
---
10% rep
---
I gotta admit, it would be pretty cool to run around as your hero in classic one day haha!
---
;)    i hang out at the great lift in thousand needles for that reason
---
No belfs in classic, sorry bruh.
---
A good post in a sea of udder crap. Well done OP!
---
Depends on whether or not we get a beta. If we do, which we likely will get *something* either open or closed, addon devs will have time to build some simple ones. We'll see swing timers, druid bars, autoshot timers, DoT timers, etc. almost immediately.
---
I didn't record this.
---
I lead these raids from classic-BC.

---
I use to lead these raids in Alliance Cities on Gul'dan Server almost every week in Classic-BC. I never recorded the raids but apparently an Alliance player did, this is part of one of my raids. I found this by chance on Reddit over a decade later and was floored when I saw that it was one of my raids!
---
Teldrassil due to how much experience you get from completing all the quests. You are easily level 12 completing the quests and killing mobs along the way, and you can hit 13 with only a moderate amount of grinding. Which is important as you want to avoid having to move away from Darkshore before you can start with Ashenvale and the Wetlands.  
---
Teldrassil has no mining nodes however. Only really an issue for night elf warriors.
---
Ive always loved that place
---
1. I started in vanilla, during the trial
---
2. I bought the game and TBC, and started playing seriously during TBC
---
3. As soon as I hit Outland, things I hated started to appear. That level 58 greens are way better than the level 60 blues waiting in my bags.
---
4. When progressing through Hellfire Peninsula, I hated the entire chain of depression in quests - "unfortunately, there are new orders for you" "I will reward you with new orders", etc
---
5. When progressing through Zangarmarsh, I hated the entire avatar-themed landscape and mushroom forests. It wasn't any close to the glory of Morrowind.
---
6. When progressing through Netherstorm, I hated all that weird purple everything, as well as ethereal landscapes.
---
7. At level cap, I SERIOUSLY HATED daily quests. I did them one day, another day, and then it became BORING with all that being forced to replay it everyday. Do you watch the same movie everyday?
---
8. I also hated how many items required ARENA RATING. I just hated arenas, and that blocked me from the better PVP items. Which made BGs unreliable for me, as I couldn't progress all the way in PVP anyway.
---
9. I loved the entire un'goro crystal pylon system, and it was a pity that it was only good at low levels. Then, sometime I was thinking about it, and "hey, vanilla had level cap of 60, so it was valid for endgame back then!" - that's when I started to think about how I'd prefer vanilla
---
10. Some time during WotLK, I've heard stories about how time-consuming and boring it was, how you had to farm several bosses in BRD many times to get some loot someone wanted, how you had to return to BRD so many times for so many quest chains. It has put me to doubt - "maybe it wasn't that good". But then, I've heard that Vanilla had no daily quests. "hell, that's just for me"
---
11. When Cataclysm came, I had to do that heroic farm everyday for emblems. I couldn't help, but think of what I've heard about vanilla and BRD progression - it was just about a few quets and items, and then you were done. And, every single quest was different. Really, it doesn't sound that bad?
---
12. Later on, I really wanted Blizzard to release Classic servers - but then "you think you do, but you don't". Maybe he was right? I haven't played Vanilla, so I can't be sure.
---
13. So, I decided to give a private server a try. And only there, I learned how really epic iT was. How it lacked the TBC's GearScore-based itemization, how it made even low-level content important, effectively making endgame start as early as level 45... I got to 60, progressed all that quests in BRD (except a few), progressed a bit through MC, and... I definitely wanted it. Even though the PVP was not completely balanced, it didn't matter for me, because I never really played that hardcore.
---
14. So, I joined during TBC, but in fact, I'd prefer vanilla. Even though I subbed during TBC, I preferred vanilla
---
15. And that's why WotLK had more subs than Vanilla. Not because it was better.
---
Should exist probably. I transferred from a PvP realm to a new PvP realm back in like 2006.
---
This. 
---
I mained a Human Warlock in Vanilla. Sure, WotF was a pain sometimes, but it wasn't a deal breaker. It's one fear removal per UD per two minutes. You'll be fine. And you'll appreciate BoP and Freedom from your Pally buddies.
---
In fact, there will be so many fewer Alliance Warlocks running around that you might even have a better time. If my crew somehow ends up as Alliance, I'll be rolling Warlock 100%.
---
Wasn't there a post saying they won't do RP servers? Or was that just RP-PvP?
---
Barely noticeable because you're killing mobs way faster and you don't have to maneuver through certain areas to avoid pulling more than 1-2 mobs(which usually means death. It's not as fast as a solo hunter for example but it's not as slow as people think when you take all the things into consideration.
---
It's looking like I'm gonna be a female dwarf rogue or female gnome rogue. I've had a female dwarf for as long as I could remember, since before it was cool.
---
I'd honestly say Male Nightelfs are going to be the rarest this go around. They're a pretty big meme. I instantly judge male Nightelfs either as a kid, or just a really bad player lol. I'm prejudiced against male Nightelfs. Who would choose that like wtf? I'll tell you who, my buddy sandyvag, who enjoyed ganking level 30s in hillsbrad, as a male nightelf Hunter in t2.
---
The world feeling big and having to run/ride everywhere. I'm excited to have 2 versions of the game. Oh, I've got 20 minutes to spare? I'll pop onto retail and bang out a few world quests. Oh, I have 2 hours to spare? Maybe a "quick" dungeon run in Classic.
---
In order for multiple officers to be able to access the bank, they needed to all have login info for the bank alt's acct
---
Warlocks need to be level 45 to summon max level characters if I remember correctly. Top guilds may require members to have them.
---
While this is true, Classic cant be as big of a project as a full expansion. I’d like to imagine we will get it a little sooner
---
retail bad classic good
---
My List:
---
1. Elwynn Forest
---
2. Teldrassil
---
3. Tirisfall Glades
---
4. Durotar
---
5. Dun Morogh
---
6. Mulgore
---
It's 2pm somewhere. Where is what I am waiting for? 
---
If we get a beta, they should release it quick, summer is coming !
---
&gt;Vanishing death coil is much easier with spell batching, because you have a much bigger window to do so in
---
Correct
---
&gt;Death coil is also an instant-cast spell
---
Yes, but it's also a projectile with a spell travel mechanic. Therefore it's treated differently to instant spells like blind, counterspell etc. that have no travel time.
---
&gt;Hammer of Justice is a terrible example, because you generally can't predict when a paladin will stun you. There's no particular play, or counterplay with it, that spell batching enables.
---
Wrong on so many levels. Examples like Vanish HoJ are literally only possible due spell batching. Without it, you either have the vanish go off or the HoJ. If a pally runs at you spamming HoJ, or a cc effect is ending on him, and you anticipate it with the max range in mind, you can pull it off with spell batching.
---

https://www.twitch.tv/traxelol/clip/WealthyHonorableWallabySmoocherZ
---
&gt;A lot of people in this thread are confusing an increase in latency (Which is closer to what spell batching is)
---
It really isn't and shows your lack of understanding the system.
---
&gt;Spell batching does not produce potential for 'mlg 420 high-skill play' (At least, until TBC, with its spell reflects and shadow word: death + poly.)
---
Again, false information. Shadow Word: Death primarily works because the delay in self inflicted damage is delayed by the spell itself. You can look at it like the travel time from a projectile, just like death coil.
---
Why Elwyn? Genuinely curious. It has a decent atmosphere sure, but I've always hated the quests. Also atmosphere-wise, Mulgore and Teldrassil blows it out of the water, imo.
---
Yeah my Classic guild is old as dirt. We're gonna need hearing aids and Depends to get through raid night.
---
Fortunately, Blizzard caters to dying servers. We could get merged into another server if things go south.
---
I was thinking of finding an RP server with the lamest name :P
---
The physical server they ran had nothing to do with how blizzard did it. 
---
&gt;the higher ups who control what they do
---
This is one very common misconception I keep hearing parroted and this is coming from someone who's been with a AAA game developer for the past 16 years. I'm not sure what people think but an executive is not going to go to a dev team and tell them to use sharding. Executives give direction to company teams, they direct teams to start investing in microtransactions or direct a team to focus on building or retaining their playerbase or telling a team to reduce spending or focus in X Y or Z area. Executives jobs are to traverse the industry landscape scouting out the optimal paths for their company to grow which results in them driving their teams in the direction they believe is in the best interest of their company.
---
So if a focus is microtransactions or fiscal responsibility an executive isn't going to come down to a team leader and say remove this part of the game or add this specific thing, they're going to leave the design work of implementing that direction to the game makers. This includes things like shading and spellbatching.
---
What's the company focus for Classic, is it to build goodwill with the community? Is it simply to build a playerbase from players who have left current wow? From the sounds of it (Since JAB said they'll keep it running even if they only have 10 active players), it sounds like it's a passion project that's been given a flat budget with no current long term plans (ie constant development, expansion, patching etc.). I mean sure they could be lying to us, but companies don't really outright lie to their playerbase, if they aren't sure or have other plans they simply say nothing so the fact that JAB has given those details is pretty telling of what direction they have for Classic.
---
If Classic becomes immensely popular (as in if it overtakes retail which some people suggest which I firmly believe is not within the realm of possibility) the executives at Acti-Blizzard may see an opportunity to grow the company through Classic which result in additional funding for future development (who knows what exactly that might mean). That's really not an issue for right now though.
---
My overall point is that something like sharding will be at the sole discretion of the game team, not executives, it's just too low level.
---
Furthermore my thing with sharding is that there's literally no reason to use it outside of launch. There's no gameplay reason and no fiscal reason, the only reason left is that people are simply afraid of blizzard adding something back into the game they don't like simply because they've done it before, not because there's an actual reason for them to add it in.
---
I know it's been beat to death but with all the info we have now versus 15 years ago, I think I'm having a harder time deciding on a class than I ever had originally.  Part of me wants to get big-ol' numbers on the meters, part of me wants to support my other players in bg's, but all-in-all I just can't figure it out what I want to play.  Re-watching all these old pvp vids makes it even harder.  I've been watching all the different classes and they all "work" on some level if your decent enough.  But most of all, I just want to hop on an official classic server.  Can't wait til release.  See you all there!
---
Didn't even think of shift clicking 😂
---
This isn't 2005 where all the 13 year olds are desperately trying to play as aragorn/legolas. There will be plenty of female trolls and dwarfs. We are living 15 years on post hipster movement where the definition of being cool is just being different and counter cultural.  
---
If you want to try hard being different go male nelf priest.
---
The ones I remember on my realm Thunderhorn:  
---
Hi You Buy My Stuff Yes  
---
The Lumberjack Society
---
I'll be playing a Tauren Warrior, which by no means is obscure, but I feel like I'm going to be standing there amidst a sea of Orc Warriors.
---
Yeah prob
---
Actually I think we *believe* energy is the  fundamental part.  Everything is made from that.
---
It's not even just the difficulty, but the amount of time and work involved. Older versions of WoW required a lot more time sync, and it makes everything feel like more of an accomplishment. Current players won't see it that way... They will just see it as needless grind.
---
I personally can't stand how much is just handed to you these days. Even little stuff like being given flight paths, or not needing ammo for a bow/gun. Most people just don't appreciate this stuff... But I do. The worst is when people call this rose colored glasses... The ten years I've played on private servers proves that wrong lol. 
---
I don't know why you're getting down-voted it's just a unique way of leveling. I'm definitely interested to hear your strategy.
---
Ultimately people will have to really go out of there way to pull this off.  You would literally need to wear fake gear during the whole run.  People will ask you to put the gear on, or notice you not wearing it then ask you to put it on.  This will be the new norm with loot trading. Once that happens, if I’m not mistaken, the gear isn’t tradable anymore.  That means you would have to also have that specific piece (unenchanted) in your bag.  Otherwise your a ninja.  Nothing new here, it will happen, but don’t see it being abused.
---
There will be a swing timer in the first few days, I have no doubt about it
---
My ui always sucks. I was just joking man. We all had horrid UIs back in the day 
---
Yes and they had to rebuild vanilla since blizzard server data were never leaked.
---
Does it make more sence that Blizzard wanted to know how a Pserver work when you can find it on Google (at least the wotlk ones irrc) than that Blizzard wished to know whether classic wow would be worth trying ?
---
I love how you're acting like you're so much smarter than everyone else in this comment chain while also being completely unable to understand basic gameplay mechanics.
---
* There is no need to weave your abilities between autoattacks, you can just do them as you come in for the autoattack and then get out of range again.
---
* There is no abilities "off-GCD instant" to use that requires you to be in melee range until level 36 for warriors and 40 for shamans. 
---
I love it. You are /r/iamverysmart material. Thanks for being entertaining at least, that was a very good troll.
---
Not getting ganked, but literally just last night I dreamed that my dog ([Badger the Greyhound](https://i.imgur.com/wxGI4pv.jpg)) got free and ran off into the Arathi Highlands.  I was so worried that a Raptor or something was going to get him that when I finally caught up to him, I picked him up and set out to carry him back to the Undercity, which I knew would be safe.  For some reason the route took us through from Arathi to Hillsbrad to Western Plaguelands before we made it.
---
Slam spec will have to be investigated on classic. At least I will.
---
Apparently they don't use it on pservers, however I used it back in Vanilla and I thought it was fine (I remember being scolded because I took agro from the MT on Onixya while slam spamming).
---
I never trust the theory-crafters completely, I go test by myself. Sometimes their calculations don't stand a good old reality check.
---
Nothing like an in game wedding 
---
You are right, Sandbox is not the right term and, in fact, Vanilla/Classic is probably closer to a sandbox nature than retail is. i'll try to rephrase.
---
Hamstring kiting makes leveling more fun to me.  I wasn’t using a timer, but I probably will this time (when one is available).
---
My friends and I always create our own guild named &lt;Oh Snap&gt;
---
RemindMe! 3 Months
---
Arh yeah, I see how that can add up, probably a bit to gimmicky for me. I will probably go find myself a pocket warrior, and just focus on keeping us alive.
---
imirak's argument is "If they were there to PvP, then it doesn't matter what dies, so long as it gets the opposing faction to show up." Whereas your argument is "They were there to farm honor, so getting DHKs ruined their day."  
---
Basically, honor gave non-PvPers a reason to PvP (grinding to get rewards), whereas the people whom only played to PvP would not have cared how many civvies died as, after all, "red is dead".  
---
Add a dash of elitism (I don't want those casual PvP folk in my neighborhood!) and you have this back-and-forth you two have going.
---
&lt;And Two Stealthed Rogues&gt;
---
I understand that rationale, but my one and only hope for classic is that it feels like a world, not a q-hub. I will wait as long as I need to in Q if that’s the case. Will spend said time out in the world, farming or what not.

TN - US?

Hellscream Marauders, later called Borrowed Time, was active from Vanilla through Cata. More or less. 
---
There was a raiding guild that transferred there at the end of Wrath to score server first achieves. They all left before the end of Cata. Their remnants started a guild that raided there in the first tier of MoP then fizzled.
---
Now it’s so dead that I legit saw a guy have an uninterrupted convo with himself for 10 minutes in trade. 
---
For everyone that shit on my batching posts, suck it!!!!  
---
WOOOOH
---
my first ever character was a dwarf and this is my oldest memory in wow, i was awestruck even though i was 10 at the time.
---
There is a fiscal reason. Those sweet sweet casual bucks. And you say it's too low level, but enough pressure to appeal to the casuals could force them into doing it. A more hands on exec, unsatisfied with Classic, could easily tell them to implement specific systems they've already done before to appeal to casuals on retail.
---
There's no way Classic is a passion project. Do I believe that the current dev team is passionate about it? Yes, but it was in no way conceived as a passion project after the whole "you think you do, but you don't" debacle. They're doing it to get subs back after years of decline in population.
---
I agree that Classic will likely never exceed Retail's population, if only because new players are likely to gravitate to Retail first, but it wouldn't surprise me to see the concurrent player numbers be close.
---
&lt; Big Ol' Critties &gt;
---
So if the hunter veterans have 187 days on average, it’s my hunter’s 30th day, and a bow drops...who gets it? 
---
Well done
---
Some guilds will publicly announce their server selections in their guild ads in various forums so that'll give you an idea of which will be more popular for each server type.
---
Beyond that, it's possible they'll only have select servers open on day 1 to funnel everyone into those, and open more servers only as population gets too high. I've seen a lot of game releases in recent years do stuff like that, so chances are if you make a character on day 1/2, you'll be on a high pop server.
---
Man, this entire thread is fucking gold. I can't even
---
My 3 favorites are the 3 least favorites overall according to the poll, interesting... Durotar, Mulgore, Teldrassil &gt; All!

He is being obnoxious about it, but he is not wrong. You won’t have enough mobs to both benefit from the regen. If you somehow did then yes it would be best if you could both get it, but you can’t. That is the full answer m8, no hidden secrets to it.
---
Dw is more fun but less effective I would say
---
I'm going to try to find out where the big streamers are rolling so I can go elsewhere. I'll watch the streams, but a group of big streamers could take over a server and I don't want to deal with that.
---
GDKP Hope that will be common for MC pugs
---
Yeah, I meant battle for azeroth. I'm very out of touch with retail though and though the title was battle of azeroth lol.

Sounds like a badass dream.
---
So were you realistic and human in a cartoonish Horde-controlled world? Was your dog realistic as well?
---
I can’t wait!
---
100% there with you. Elwynn was the cocaine... first time walking into Loch Modan was the meth. Never looked back
---
&lt;Naga stole my bike&gt;
---
I agree with this. Early on almost all guilds will want to keep the loot within the guild. There would be bad blood if the guild funnels all tank gear into the MT for a month straight and then MT turns around and starts building pugs with his lockout.
---
Just RP-PvP, they will have regular RP-PvE servers.
---
My list:
---
1. Tirisfal
---
2. Elwynn
---
3. Durotar
---
4. Teldrassil

I find I'm so excited that I can barely sit still or hold a thought in my head. I think it's the excitement only a Vanilla player can feel. A Vanilla player at a start of a long journey whose conclusion is grinding reputation and farming raid materials. I hope I can make it to Tarren Mill without getting ganked. I hope to see a healer and shake their hand. I hope my epic mount is as beautiful as it has been in my dreams. I hope.

You're free to have your own opinion, except that battle groups were still a far cry removed from full blown cross realm and sharding in retail.
---
If you want the world to feel less like a hub, then you should focus on not having battle masters in main cities, or removing Dishonorable kills from the PvP system which locked said honor grinders to never leave the city.
---
Make your own discord server. Just type in chat, anyone want to hop in discord and level together? You'll find a friend very quickly. Everybody wants friends, hardly anybody is comfortable taking the first step.

I didn't see this post when i learned about the meeting and it appears you were right about it being discussed, although they didn't spend all 5 hours talking about it &amp; "Community analysis through survey and Nostalrius data", seems like i wasn't wrong either.
---
28 here. I grew up watching my older sister's boyfriend (who lived with us) raid Onyxia for hours. Can't wait to relive the magic and finally be the one who gets to 60 and raids what used to be so unfathomably out of my reach!
---
Not really.  If the path is optimised for the servers conditions,  those conditions don't match Vanilla because they're guesses, then any variation could dramatically change the value.  Running the same path on Classic WoW could land them taking twice as long.
---
Imagine your ankles being gnawed off by a vicious cat.
---
Now reverse the roll and be the cat with a fascination for ankles.
---
That’s a gnome warrior/rogue. 
---
I rolled my first main on a RP-PVP server in about April of 06.
---
Honestly. It was pretty quiet. Leveling was usually a solo-ish experience. I’d run into a few people here and there but I rarely if ever was competing in quests with people of my own faction. 
---
PvP was fairly common at all times. Most of it was essentially predatory. E.g. that one T1 geared rogue that ganks lowbies in STV. Or full parties raiding lower level zones. 
---
I didn’t find a lot of actual RP going on. To be honest it seemed more like a background thing. Names that should have been flagged, rarely were.
---
A buddy that got me into the game explained RP-PvP servers essentially in this manner “Its still PvP, but players there are usually a  more mature and treat it a bit less like it’s just a game.”
---
Yes, I was literally just myself as usual, with my dog as usual.  Just for some reason we were in cartoonish Azeroth.  In the dream I wasn't worried about the cartoonishness not making sense as much as I was worried about Raptors and Bears though.
---
That’s the boat I’m in and I’m so hyped!
---
You still have +1 lootrule and MS &gt; OS in pugs. A mage won't be able toroll on Flameguard Gauntlets and when two warrior friends both roll on Flameguard and one wins it, hands it over to his friend and sacrifices his +1 roll for the lockout, then this really is just between the friends. 
---
For all I care he can disenchant or sell his won +1 item to the vendor. It is at his own discretion what he does with that item.
---
Well we are just a couple of strangers on the internet who are both more educated on the topic now. :) not trying to manipulate my source, lmao, just quoting a relevant part. 
---
I gambled with my vacation, let's hope it pays off... Release July 19th lets go please.
---
As far as I know, yes it does. And taking a quick glance it looks correct to me.
---
God this was a sad movie.
---
I wanted to say you should be worried about Horde players but races aren't bound to factions. Although the last place I'd want to be as a Horde human is amongst a bunch of undead. Always figure they might just set you ablaze as a prank (Since they can resurrect you) Would probably prefer to be amongst the Tauren and Troll women.
---
A night in with WoW was about $0.50, whereas a night out on town is like $400. Pretty easy justification. 
---
We have no news, but Battlegroups were very much so a part of vanilla as much as any other other part of patch 1.12 is.
---
They could go either way.
---
That would have made sense, but I've never played anything other than Horde.  It's 100% internalized that the Undercity is safe for me and I don't need to worry about my friendly neighborhood Forsaken and Orc bros.
---
I have no idea to this day what those two idiots in trade chat were arguing about. Truth is, I don't wanna know. Some things are best left unsaid. I like to think they were arguing about something so dumb it can't be expressed in words, and makes your head ache because of it.
---
Ironically, more players=less personal. Is it really more social seeing more people? Or is getting truly acquainted with a smaller community more social? I think the values of classic err towards the latter.
---
ok, not you, fair enough.
---
I am responding to people via the reddit mail system about a comment I made that private server records don't count for shit. Your response was to my incredulity that 20% faster is very suspicious. My apologies for confusing which thread this was part of.
---
Nevertheless a 20% reduction is super suspicious and I guess we'll have to wait until Classic to see how accurate PS are in this regard.
---
We had a DKP system with a silent bid, but 9 times out of 10, the class groups had decided among themselves ahead of time so there wasn't a DKP bid war screwing whoever won.  Sometimes the occasional ass would secretly bid, but it mostly wasn't an issue.
---
ZF was my jam. Ran it until both my cousin and I had the shitty 2h sword. 
---
Not including them on launch would be a huge mistake. I don’t have the time working a 9-5 job to reroll months in after they finally decide to add the RP - PvP option. If they have it at launch I’m rolling it and if not I’ll go to a regular PvP server, sadly. 
---
The first five talent points you get in the game give you 1% crit each in the Fury tree with Cruelty. This is a massive dps increase using any weapon directly increasing damage and indirectly rage generation since white crits produce higher rage fueling more abilities. Let's see how Arms can make up the ground it has already lost in the first five levels.
---
**Tier 1**
---
Imp Rend - +35% of nothing is still nothing, this is a filler talent and very minor dps increase.
---
Imp HS - Reduce HS rage by 2. No direct dps increase, but slightly more rage efficient. How many HS you throwing around while leveling? Not many.
---
Parry - Worthless.
---
**Tier 2**
---
Imp Charge - 6 more rage gen on charge, slightly more rage to use on the initiation.
---
Tactical Mastery - Stance dancing for zerker stance can't start until lvl 30 and that's assuming you do it perfectly every pull while leveling. Most won't utilize it to its actual potential.
---
Imp TC - Worthless.
---
**Tier 3**
---
Imp Overpower - 50% crit on OP, juicy but takes until level 26 to acquire. Level 30 Berserker stance will challenge you to stance dance it efficiently without rage loss in the small window it procs.
---
Anger Management - a strong talent
---
Deep Wounds - a nice DoT on crits, but your crit is so low while leveling and no fury talents so low proc rate.
---
**Tier 4**
---
2H Weapon Specialization - a very nice talent with a huge 5% damage bonus to 2H.
---
Impale - nice if you had crit chance to see the boost, 5/5 2H Weap Spec wins providing considerably higher dps.
---
It really can't for some time. The numbers have been run and Fury wins 1-39 in almost all iterations. In the end, play what you want to have fun but understand it's a fact not opinion that it is slower.
---
Keep in my mind the place most badly outnumbered will be the place with the quickest queues, but that also means you often won't have a full side in your bg - which just means it's even more likely people will leave from your side during the bg. So you just get crushed and lose 95% of the time or even the bg will close halfway through because there's not enough people on your team.  
---
This is the fun times awaiting people on imbalanced low pvp participation servers if there is no CRZ.
---
As if you'll get a chance to retaliate.
---
I was in my thirties when WOW came out, and then, like now I didn’t have a huge amount of spare time.  Even doing higher level dungeons took a big chunk of time.
---
I think there may be an older generation playing this time around, so there may be fewer players able to take the time needed for hardcore raiding.  Just an opinion.
---
i feel that. once i linked a classic wow announcement (i think it was the blizzcon demo?) in my old guild chat and the only person who responded to it was like ''WELL ACTUALLY, i played vanilla so i know for a fact it's a pile of trash that will never survive in this day and age, we only liked it because we were stupid and didn't know any better'' on and on...
---
don't let them get to you! this is true always, but ESPECIALLY when the game first launches, everybody is going to be so excited and eager to form new connections. i bet you'll make a lot of friends ingame really quickly, and if you want to do that before the game launches too discord is a good idea 
---
You will make friends in Classic.
---
If the game is good for nothing else, creating friendships is where it will shine. 
---
This shit I actually love. The game is so big and it takes so long to get places that I'm way into these time-saving/shaving methods
---
Lol even so, theres no arguing it was terrible, especially for healers.
---
I cannot take his guide seriously. It’s based on a private server. Stats are off.
---
When he did vanilla speed leveling it actually says on his website that he borrowed gold for mount at level 40. Do you count for that? Nobody seems to mention that.
---
Also most of his guides are around patch 1.9.X, which includes TBC quests and buffed XP from quests and mobs.
---
His latest guide says it is at 1.12 but if you look closely you will the same quests with the same XP.
---
Also he is a hunter, best leveling class.
---
Before you bash on me that it doesn’t matter that is a private server, well you are ignorant.
---
Don’t get me wrong, the guy is light years away from us in terms of leveling and he definitely knows what he is doing and puts a lot of work in to that. Respect for that.
---
Just don’t believe everything you are reading because chances are you are a different class, playing in a game that will have insane competition and nobody will give you gold are level 40 and TBC quests with buffed XP don’t exists.
---
Having a dude assault you from behind while you can't get away isn't a dream about a video game.
---
You may want to set up a camera while you sleep.
---
I guess people you’re talking about are people playing BfA currently? I think a lot of those players see classic as competition, or as something that undermines their retail achievements and account. It’s an emotional, defensive reaction.
---
At 30 rage, it ain't free buddy. It's not a smarter choice because the iterations have been run and the game is not new. Fury wins. Numbers haven't changed on this game. Don't get sucked into reading tooltips at face value in Vanilla - they are quite deceiving.
---
Billpaxton- ninja looted all the loot from 25 man naxx last boss, to me and my friends i think server drak tharon
---
Yeah, I tend to agree April will be the month when they announce the release date.
---

---
That 90-10 population imbalance
---
You can either choose to raid with 4/5 imp slam and sqeeze it into your normal fury rotation or just go regular 20/31 2h fury and skip slam alltogether, putting more emphasis on spamming hamstring to trigger WF procs between your normal abilities.
---
2h fury is pretty straight forward if you choose the latter.
---

[Hmmm....](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6nUYRovi3u4Id1Wo/giphy.gif)
---
Private servers implemented batching.  They are actually far closer to classic than many people care to admit, its not 2012 pservers anymore.
---
There are a lot of people who were in there 50's during vanilla that are now retired and ready to spend 16 hours a day playing classic.
---
1. Vanish HOJ is only possible with spell batching. I don't disagree.
---
HOJ Fear, on the other hand, is a terrible example. Fear has 0 cd, getting a double fear-stun doesn't actually help the warlock any (Unlike a double coil/vanish or hoj/vanish), and there is no reason for the paladin to delay his HOJ until the end of the fear cast, when spell batching is in play (Because he'd rather not get feared).
---
There's nothing that you do *differently* in that encounter based on the fact that spell batching exists. The warlock wants the fear to go off before the HoJ casts. The paladin wants to cast HoJ before the fear goes off. There's no elite counterplay either one is doing *because* there's 400 ms of batching. All it does is increase the window for *both* abilities to go off at the same time. You see fear -&gt; you HoJ.  That's the play. That's it. Whether or not one, or both go off, is, at that point, up to the gods of batching and RNG, not player skill.
---
2. With spell batching you have a +400ms window to pull off the SW:D trick. It goes from being very finicky to nearly 100% reliable.
---
There are kids in high school who will be able to experience that now though.
---
Even if they down the road ruin it, if it launches faithfully and gives me a couple few years of that gameplay back before that, I’ll have gotten the value out of it.  I just want to experience it again with the knowledge to appreciate it more than I did back then.
---
&lt;Gank Green Gang&gt;
---
I live in Minnesota, so I'm thinking my best bet is to pick a Chicago server, streamers are probably gonna play on coastal servers. 
---
1. Make a post spreading misinformation about skills that reset auto attack timers when they don’t, check
---
2. Make an argument in favor of efficient mob grinding by eating 20-30% of your hp sitting in melee range all in exchange for 5-10 extra rage, check
---
3. Try making terrible, opinionated counter arguments to a well known, tried and true farming method on an original post asking how to do said method, check
---
4. Get mad and call people snowflakes for not being able to handle a different “opinion” when yours is the one not founded in fact, check
---
5. Read through people’s post histories trying to devalue their opinions by mud slinging once you figured out your opinion held no factual basis whatsoever, check
---
Man what’s that famous quote about if it smells like shit everywhere you go you might be the asshole? Your posts are just dripping with irony; 1-5 seem like pretty textbook snowflake behavior if you ask me 
---
Picking a server at random, preferably one not being played by a popular streamer.
---
Might not work on the modern client
---
Got any examples? I would assume the private server devs have checked one of the most iconic leveling videos and adjust xp rates to be the same.
---
&gt;&gt;mfw healer doesnt have my roasted quail
---
Yes, it 100% is. Same if you plan to tank in raiding.
---
Only got 3 tips for you to get the ultimate experience:
---
1. Be social and find a guild that fits you. Its 50% of vanilla WoW.
---
2. Be patient. EVERYTHING takes time so learn to enjoy the process and progress, because when you do every single reward feels orgasmic.
---
3. Try to stick to a main. Mostly due to the above tip, the time. A lot of time goes into just getting 1 toon progressing well so unless youre unemployed, more than 2 chars is gonna be rough to manage :) But also dont stress something, enjoy the process as I said.
---
Have fun!
---
Maelstrom NA was great. We had plenty of "PvP Bros" (people who had no interest in RP, and would mock RPers), but the RP community was still strong for a significant amount of time. Lots of WPvP events popped up. I remember being level 10\~ and chasing Horde through Elwynn. The server had just launched, but players were more focused on goofing off and having fun then rushing to 60 (at least many players were). A similar event took place well into the server's life during Vanilla, and the battle spilled through Elwynn and ended at the mountain pass that lead into the Great Tree in Duskwood. There were at least 2-3 raids split between the Alliance and Horde. Things like that happened pretty frequently.
---
RP community as I said was strong (alliance side experience), but faded over the expansions. We had themed guilds, story-telling events, tavern events, and RP-PvP events. The dark side of RP of course existed, but for good or ill we more or less socially ostracized them. They retreated to dark corners of the world, like the middle of the Deeprun Tram, and eventually only did the dirty while in a small group in the Stockades. 
---
PvP community was relatively strong, we had a few top-tier guys for years. PvE community had ups and downs. In Vanilla we stayed strong, I believe &lt;The Thunder Legion&gt; was a very high ranked guild back then. TBC we took a step-back but were still strong. Then the Horde stepped up and hosted a top-tier raiding community in WotLK (with &lt;Roll Initiative&gt; in the lead). That faded after WotLK, and now we're a husk.
---
I'm curious to see if RP-PvP server long-term health will be more successful in a Vanilla environment. Hopefully we get at least 1. 
---
I'll probably play a male night elf because i want to try out alliance and i'm playing druid. So it's either that or the sin of playing a NE female. And we all know that if you're a dude who plays female night elf or human you have some things in your life you need to fix.
---
Didn't that guy abuse some pserver bugs though? Joana said he doubts sub 3 days would be possible with legit leveling ways.
---
Critcap against another lvl60 player if you're using a 2h weapon will be around 50-60%, which is virtually un-attainable.
---
I dont think these projects have the same pace of schedule as Classic has tbh. So I dont think the gap from announcement of date to release will be as big. Guesstimation from me tho.
---
Paladin and Warlock both get free 60% speed mounts
---
100% not a private server bug. This has always been possible in the original game, all the way through at least WotLK. Getting rid of it would be considered #Changes, in which case I want respecs at 5g and population cap at 10,000. 
---
Female gnome warrior with twin pink ponytails, helmet off. Being killed by that is insult of highest degree. Oh, biggest baddest 2 hander required (like ashkandi or draconic cleaver)
---
Disclaimer: I am a hunter.. :-P
---
Starshards!
---
I started in the 2 week Open Beta before Vanilla.
---
And I'm hesitant to read all these "I never played Vanilla but I'm sure I'll love it more" stories, because there hasn't been a mainstream successful game since WoW that had the same level of grindy and boredom that Vanilla did.  WoW became the dailies repetition thing, because they saw people going into a field and killing boars for hours on end, because it got something.
---
I literally spend 4 days on a hill behind, 18 hours a day, killing and skinning Raptors, in order to get the 100G required to buy my \*Level 40\* mount.  The first point you could get a mount in the game was 40 levels after you started, and no-one ever had enough gold to buy it straight away.  You had to grind for your \*first\* mount.
---
People say "That sounds great!" and while I know it felt rewarding at the end, it was a boring grind.  We did it because we enjoyed the game, not because we enjoyed the activity.  The biggest thing in WoW Vanilla was the people and the community, and that's what kept people coming back day after day.  You did crazy things with friends, you got your attunements with a guild group, everyone had a story about something crazy \*someone else\* had done.  None of this "I did this" stories.  But "Remember when Ral jumped off Thunder Bluff and Miyane dived after him to cast levitate, but forgot to hit herself, so he floated down to her cratered corpse to Rez".  
---
The biggest thing that Vanilla did for people is make friendships, teams, groups.  And as WoW has become less and less group focussed, less community relevant, that's why the magic has died for those early players.  Classic won't bring that magic back, unless people make the magic again.  And its got the setup to do it, but that's because of its limitations, not because it had some special mechanic or increased other thing. 
---
Life was hard, so we made friends to get us through it.  The reward wasn't the grinding, it was the friends grinding along beside you.
---
I have the urge to roll the most contrarian combos, gnome warrior nelf priest etc.
---
*I find I'm so excited, I can barely sit still or stop posting on reddit. I think it's the excitement only a Classic vet can feel, a Classic Vet at the start of a long journey whose conclusion is uncertain. I hope I can launch it at midnight. I hope to see my friends and /shake their hands. I hope the Alliance banners are as blue as they has been in my dreams. I hope.*
---
Side note: I'm only JUST NOW connecting the "Hope is a dangerous thing." line with the last line of the movie. I feel so dumb.
---
I never asserted there wouldn't be a solid difference between a 'good' (dedicated, hardcore) and 'bad' (casual, someone who does little research and preparation), just that it doesn't come down to a 'high skillcap' (because every rotation in classic, including hunter, is very simple). I don't consider spending tons of time getting consumables like engineering items or all possible buffs, nor knowing the ins and outs of every encounter, to be 'skillful' in any sense.
---
If anything, you are validating everything I'm saying. There's a difference between a good and a bad mage, but it doesn't come down to any sort of rotational skillcap but rather gearing, consumables, and encounter knowledge (preparation), because they are both just spamming frostbolt.
---
This is really dumb. They probably have an internal release date, but they gave us the vague one so they don't feel pressured. IF they give us a release date, that means that if anything isn't ready by the release date, then the launch experience will not be what they, or we want it to be. It will lower the quality of the product 95% of the time.
---
I assume we are going to get only one RP-PvE server, so the choice will be quite simple.
---
There are many things he didnt think of back then that can be used in classic aswell to cut off alot of time. 
---
don't forget, it not only breaks fear, but makes them immune for 5 seconds afterwards.
---
Brah, those guys are dead weight. We'll all either be your friend or your enemy, depending on faction.
---
If you *don't* know that Classic is THE game to be hyped for in 2019, you're just... well... stupid. I don't care for such a person's opinion on games.
---
Maybe it's just me, but I hate any sort of meme guild name. You don't have to go full RP, but naming your guild "Own the libs" or "Harambe's vengeance" is exceedingly cringy.
---
I really don't need to be reminded of politics or teenage memes when i'm trying to just play WoW.
---
&gt; Which made BGs unreliable for me, as I couldn't progress all the way in PVP anyway
---
a lot of your list is just nonsense but this particularly is where i stopped reading
---
BG's were just fine in regular non arena pvp gear you could still get 400+ resilience, i know as i had full sets of normal BG gear with no arena pieces and i was able to be competitive
---
For me, I’d like at least double than what Classic had originally. Idk what their plans are as far as total servers, so idk what they’re thinking. If I had to guess, they won’t be doing 2.5k-3k servers. 6k seems like a decent compromise between Vanilla and Nost. The world is a lot more fun with more people, imo. 
---
Good thought. I hadn't considered that. I really just want a decently populated PvP server. I feel like the community of players who sticks around in Classic will be pretty good.
---
They were following the data. The casuals made up the bulk of their subs. Hindsight is always 20/20. That and for a number of years the hardcore players were the only ones screaming for vanilla
---
shit like this is why I'm so glad I got to enjoy vanilla the first time around in a semi serious / semi casual guild. Still got to see most of AQ40 and a tidbit of Naxx, but didn't have to put up with this kind of shit lol
---
Unfortunately it’s very likely that Battlegroups will be a thing in Classic. Battlegroups will definitely have a huge impact on the whole horde vs alliance rivalry. 
---
Before Battlegroups you always fought the same enemies in BGs and you developed so much hate and vengeance for each other. And simultaneously developed a bond with your own faction players. The pvp community was beyond amazing. But all this instantly died when they introduced Battlegroups. Because now you never saw the same people again. All you did was join a BG with complete strangers, do the objective asap, and get out of there to requeue again.
---

i dont like nelves and never played them much but teldrassil is gorgeous and the music was the best
---
elwynn for sentimentality
---
tirisfal for atmosphere and lore
---
Why did OP have to remind us this scene... The feels man, I can't handle it
---
Well yeah I guess so. Getting ragnaros I'd drop mace spec and get 2 more points into 2h and then have an extra 3 points to spend. I think because of the proc they'd come out pretty close until you can get aq or nax 2hers.
---
Ah the classic post history search to try and gain any “high ground” in an argument rooted in factual gameplay mechanics. Like the comments above have stated, SS and other similar skills DO NOT reset your AA, only procs like WF / Sword spec / certain items can, but please continue spreading misinformation in an original post asking how to hamstring kite. If you can’t handle being unequivocally wrong in a post on a subreddit dedicated to FACTUAL gameplay mechanics that have been proven, that says a lot about you; or the fact that you need to block people because they’ve shown you the errors in your logic and you’d rather bury your head in the sand (snow maybe?).
---
Let people who actually know the game talk about it intelligently, while you can remain in your safe space farming super slowly on whatever class has the misfortune of you at the controls.
---
Because humans are obviously the superior race.
---
In that case, human is uniformly just good because the rep bonus helps with some early on PVP gearing too, and the sword bonus is across-the-table useful
---
I heard it for the first time in a final fantasy 11 video of a dark Knight using high level mobs to mass party kill groups of low level players in yhoator jungle. The guy was level 75, thr mob he was using was like level 50 and the people he was getting killed were level 28-30. So many dead low level players. And they all lose experience on death
---
&gt; Continuing with the last example, a combat rogue using Brutality Blade and a warrior using Obsidian Edged Blade will probably do more damage total than a warrior using Brutality Blade and a rogue using Dal'rends.
---
This right here is why my favorite loot system is DKP or EPGP with Loot Council oversight.

The fact that 90% of loot decisions are based in a point system means that worries surrounding favoritism or unfair loot practices are put to rest, and the LC Oversight means that in instances of significant upgrades there's always some sort of veto/override power preventing people from exploiting the DKP system to buy stupid loot.
---
It requires buy-in from the whole guild, but assuming it's adopted, your example I quoted would be a good time for a melee class lead of some sort to step in and point out to that Warrior how much bigger an upgrade the Brutality Blade would be for that rogue and how it would increase the raid's DPS as a whole.  Most reasonable people are capable of understanding the nuance here, so it's just a matter of the Loot Council using their override powers sparingly.  As long as the trust is there, I really think it's the best system.
---
&gt; The benefit of choosing Druid is easier itemisation in general, especially in higher tier raids there is loot that is specifically made for Feral Druids or hybrid Druids that noone else will want.
---
Fucking this. Stuff like [Dragon's Blood Cape](https://classicdb.ch/?item=17107) or [Taut Dragonhide Shoulderpads](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19389) is sort of just meant for bear tanks. A Warrior or DPS *could* use them, sure, but they'd be rolling on their chance of winning a suboptimal piece as their one get of the week. Meanwhile, I've seen druids get like 2-3 pieces per raid sometimes since the stuff that drops is almost exclusive to them.
---
Your friends sound douchey
---
lol ok
---
i hope you're not disappointed.  the higher your expectations, the higher the chance (and severity) of being let down
---
my advice is to interact with players and find your way into a fun guild ASAP because its just so much better.  chatting and doing dungeons together etc 
---
prepare for pressing 2 buttons for hours on end :P
---
Subway Eat Flesh
---
Ganksters Paradise
---
And my all time favorite is &lt;Cereal Killers&gt;  and we all had names like Capncrunch, Kornpops, etc...
---
Hey... you guys wanna chip in to get me a computer strong enough to play WoW?
---
Yeah, especially with the spell batching, ping isn't such a big factor like it is for a MOBA/FPS. Almost all big streamers are on the west coast. In my experience, midwesterners tend to be a bit more friendly, too (that may be my own bias, though, lol). 
---
Can not wait. My entire friends group (around 10 people) are gearing up for classic. Only 3 of us have ever even played the game, all 3 of us started in vanilla. I personally am on the edge of my seat and haven’t been this excited for WoW in a lonnnnnnnnnnng time. I don’t really play much anymore cause of current expansion but I seriously am so stoked to play vanilla again. T’was only a noob then. 
---
&gt;dont have any GBP left to buy raid gear 
---
I feel like people are just voting the one they leveled the most in.
---
I loved Durotar for a starting region, but I mainly played Alliance.  I hated Elwynn Forest because the quest setup was horrible and just made you run from one end to the other and back constantly.  Teldrassil for me is second, but the latter third of it (north of the road, western side) mostly got skipped every time.
---
It's such a cozy yet free feeling starter area, i love the tropical feel too once you get to sen'jin, i'm heavily biased though as that's where i first experienced WoW.
---
&gt; you have some things in your life you need to fix.
---
Please elaborate
---
MOM! More Hot Pockets!
---
Just think, when the achievements came out, people did this more lol. All for that Black War Bear lol
---
How many times will this be answered?
---
There's one that plays on private servers right now. 
---
\&gt;  no-one ever had enough gold to buy it straight away 
---
not true, even though he was a paladin my friend had over 100g at lvl 40 when we played vanilla.  bastard wouldn't loan me some for my mount tho :'(
---
but yeah i think you're right that people who never played it before are going to be quite jarred by the reality.  i recommend ppl get into fun guilds asap
---
You make it seem like fury is exponentially better, and it isn't. You can't prove it either. Factor in rolling on a pvp server and arms starts to make alot more sense. Yeah the raw dmg output of fury is higher, but the utility that arms brings has some significant benefits. And lol if you think ss isn't a net benefit. Like telling rogues not to take bf because it costs energy.
---
I never got a mount or any achievements for doing this, I was doing it simply for the World PvP!
---
That's exactly what I thought upon looking at the picture.
---
Too bad that wasn't the intended purpose. T__T
---
PvP gear is never useless. Just looking at Druids because that's the class I know best: the Rank 13 set has more armor (needed for Bear Form) and more efficient itemization compared to the Genesis set from AQ40. I'd say the PvP gear is better despite the lower item level. Meanwhile, Naxx doesn't have hybrid gear with every stat on it, which sucks for PvP.
---
Besides, small differences in gear don't really matter in PvP. In PvE you can't really overcome gear discrepancies: if someone has better gear than you, and if you both play at a reasonably high level, then you're always going to lose on the damage meters. Same thing with arenas from later expansions: gear is a lot more important when it's always a fair fight with the exact same number of players, no consumables, and death is permanent.
---
PvP in Vanilla is dynamic and every situation is completely different. You just need gear that's *good enough* to be competitive in Vanilla PvP. The blue PvP set is good enough to make you competitive at all levels of PvP.
---
Picking a PST timed Roleplay Server.  Just like I did for Vanilla.  Go Silver Hand!
---
It's a joke based on the somewhat true fact that a lot of dudes who play attractive looking girls in video games are creeps or misfits.
---
The twin ponytails is very common amongst gnome females.  
---
My gnome had the triple pigtails.  
---
And will have again.  
---
Well thought out.   
---
I agree with points 1-5. 6 I think is too meta and is only for very serious guilds.   
---
The loot system I used/will use "values each member in the raid kill and provides an opportunity for each person to get a shot at that loot.".    
---
Too often you bring new/pug people to the raid and they have 0% chance of getting loot.   
---
WTF? No. If you needed to bring them they deserve a shot.    
---
Suicide kings/rolls/simple point system for participation seems to be the best system.  
---
Loot council ignores the individual.    
---
Pure point system(DKP) ignores the guild needs.    
---
Finding a system that rewards the individual and makes sure no gear is lost due to no one wanting to spend points is the key.   
---
I think I found it.    
---
The real question is... Are you vanilla in real life?
---
Just roll on a pvp servers.  They will all be going pve.
---
this is one of the lesser reasons why im so hyped about classic. itll finally put these obscure things to rest
---
 \* almost no-one.
---
Ha! Definitely going PvP!
---
I think its the type of discussion thats needed as its a QoL change for improving server lifespan.
---
The biggest issue might be it stopping friends from easily getting on the same server at peak etc.
---
On a side note, gryphons are pretty fucking awesome.
---
&gt;what are my chances to join a casual raiding guild as a DPS warrior?
---
Are you willing to upkeep a sword &amp; board set, keep it enchanted and so on, and slap it on to offtank? If so, you are going to find a guild. If not, you'll probably still find a guild, but even casual guilds will want you to be capable of tanking. Remember, there is a huge shortage of tanks in vanilla because only 1 class can do it, and the other specs are pretty much chart-topping, PVP facesmashing specs that everyone wants to gear up for. There will be a huge demand for tanks.  
---
Yeah, maybe. But if OP wants to go for it, who are any of us to say he/she shouldn’t? Dismissing a goal outright because it’s harder/not optimal/less likely is kind of disingenuous. 
---
Yea I mean I played bfa and vanilla...but like what the hell does this meme even mean?
---
I’m playing a Druid as my main so I can level feral and tank heal or dps whatever dungeon I need. 
---
I’ll be duo leveling a Pally / lock combo with my bro when we can level together. 
---
Now i want an addon for whenever I enter STV, Axl Rose just starts screaming "D'YOU KNOW WHERE THE FUCK YOU ARE!? YOU IN THE JUNGLE BABY. WAKE UP, IT'S TIME TO DIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE"
---
Pre-Armor mounts.  I don't know if I'll aim to get one, but I hope the put them in.
---
Has zf changed much?
---
As someone who started when WoW first released... TBC was definitely my favorite. Wrath was great too, but I prefer Vanilla over Wrath. Then it's just all downhill from there for me :/
---
i like your answer
---
Sorry that I have to disagree. As a duo you will often have to grind out some levels because you are gaining less xp per mob. If you dont grind alot extra inbetween quests, you will fall behind on levels. As a duo it will remain fast but you will for example start to kill 1.5x faster than a solo with higher level, while only gaining 0.5x xp
---
Yeah, we went through Loot Points, EP, DKP, and on, eventually just settling on loot council, by the Wrath days.
---
Many will change their minds once they set their foot there and realise it's more fun to play an actual game than World of Barbiecraft. I guarantee it.
---
Yeah thats the only change I want. If we just had one cute race to play. My life would be a lot easier right now. I'm not used to winning arguments to be honest but, Ill say this. I will be single before I fucking play alliance!... please don't tell her I said that.
---
Or we just have them as other mount options throughout the whole life cycle allowing a greater range of roleplaying options to players.
---
This has got to be it.  Blizzard is known for this kind of stuff
---
Guilds are much better organized nowadays. Everybody and their mom who is in a semi hardcore guild will have progressed through BWL and have Nefarian on farm when the AQ questline becomes available.
---
I love orc warriors 
---
That system only worked when you had people with lots of money being injected into the raid though.  We used it for our Alt runs which usually had 10 or so noobs with cash, and the money would be spread among the guild members only.
---
What am I supposed to be seeing here? Neither of those mobs had hamstring on them.
---
Yes! Dynamic weather was amazing! I really wish they hadn't removed it...
---
I think classic is going to be a much bigger hit than people anticipate. A lot of my friends are skeptics about it but I can't wait to rub it in their faces when they finally hop on the bandwagon.
---
It will be enough for you to be an OT for most content through BWL. But, to be clear, this is not a simple ask. You will be needing to still pay for pricey enchants and gear, and you'll still need to invest a lot of time and gold in being an offtank -- and depending on your guild, you may be asked to respec. When the MT leaves or has to miss a few raids because of RL issues, another warrior has to be the MT -- there must always be a lich king and there must always be prot warriors. 
---
This is why the above dude's advice is good. If you really don't ever want to be prot, then don't roll warrior. (Just like if you never ever want to heal, don't roll priest). It is certainly possible you can dps the whole classic experience and never be asked to respec -- but there is just a very high probability that as you look at more serious guilds, you will have to be more flexible in your identity. If you don't want to be flexible in your identity in vanilla, play a mono-role class like Rogue. 
---
I didn't realize that every Prot Warrior in every guild is going to have a Thunderfury by the time BWL releases.
---
I think it's pretty simple: Druids put out more threat than a Prot Warrior + less than a Fury Warrior, while also taking more damage than a Prot Warrior + less than a Fury Warrior. Thunderfury is a notable exception to this and that takes Prot Warrior threat to another level. If you're ever in a raid with 2+ Prot Warriors wearing Thunderfury, then yeah, a Druid might not be so useful.
---
Holy duck, you made me cry
---
&lt;Naga Please&gt; and &lt;2 Gruuls 1 Cup&gt;
---
Can’t believe nobody said these yet
---
From my experience on pservers, slam spec wasnt recommended because with even a small amount of ping, its easy to mess up your auto attacks.
---
You should be using hamstring in between BT/WW to fish for windfury, frenzy, and HoJ procs but it depends on how much rage you have and how close you are to BT and WW being off cooldown (you dont want to delay those abilities because you wasted your rage on hamstring).
---
You can also throw in the occasional overpower, but only if BT and WW are on cooldown and you wont lose a ton of rage by switching stances.
---
Tagging on this to ask if anyone knows the record time (or the fastest they’ve heard) of a rogue solo leveling to 60? Can’t seem to find that anywhere. 
---
DKP usually doesn't.  However Discounted DKP often did.  Where if you didn't spend any points, you simply had a 5% or 10% deduction taken off your Pool.  That usually encouraged people to spend DKP, and new players weren't so far behind the 8-ball.
---
Slam is a DPS increase on pservers, it's just hard to use if you don't have good ping (I had 200 ping so it was kinda rough)
---
One RP-PVE Server to rule them all.
---
What a journey 
---
&gt; tell me - how do you play the Paladin vs Warlock duel differently, when spell batching exists, as opposed to when it doesn't.
---
I don't know. Told you twice why I brought up that example. 
---
&gt;But I explicit wrote that my example is aimed at casuals, something they can relate to and is prone to happen naturally. 
---
It's something that can casually happen and therefore easier to understand for the guy I originally responded to. It's true that it has absolutely nothing to do with skill. Why do you think did Blizzard decide to go with the Charge/Charge Poly/Poly example instead of Vanish Coil? Because these are casual scenarios that happen to casual players. So yeah, I don't disagree there, but I think the fear hoj example is just easier to understand for him.
---
Does he have serious competition when classic comes out? I'm not connected in the speed leveling community, but I've heard of Joana, is the title already his or are there other serious competitors?
---
I'd keep a farming character on a low pop server then give a character the materials and transfer to my main server to sell them.
---
Less. Competition for farming. 
---
I leveled up to 60 in vanilla without doing it a single time, while also being a clicker and keyboard turner and zoomed-in camera player. If I can do that and get to 60 without too much frustration, you're going to be fine. 
---
Camera cannot stop the Incubus.
---
alternatively ally on pvp realms
---
the thing is allies have salvation blessing which is great for pve
---
then horde have orcs for pvp
---
Damn straight. 
---
HORDE I MAGEN
---
Cant wait to have 4 slot bags and too much mats too carry.
---
It gets worse after the head, the 4k insect parts that you need from silithus elites takes a lifetime.
---
Thats funny, you should read the Chronicle. Humans don't even come up for quite a while and when they do, its exactly what you're saying. They aren't spectacular in any particular way, but they've got shitloads of willpower and can be pretty good at almost anything. Humans in lore are like Druids in WoW.
---
Good! Druid will be one of the least played classes because everyone wants to be the obvious favorites in warr/rogue/mage basically but you should also never pick a class that way. Pick the fantasy that interests you the most. Theyre all viable in their way in a guild that suits you. 
---
Duo leveling is super fun back then too :)
---
Cutest race
---
This is fantastic. Also, try out outward if you’re looking for a decent coop rpg, divinity original sin 2 was also fantastic if you like turn based.
---
I wish we had a release date to make the wait for classic a bit more bearable.
---
This example made it much easier to understand as I did this with mounts
---
&gt;Marketing doesn't work extremely well other than launch day but we've been burned so many times it doesn't work anymore.
---
And this is why all these companies are downsizing their bloated marketing departments. You have people who will give you better marketing than you can buy... if your game is good enough to merit it. 
---
Sure. Whatever works best for you.
---
Fair enough.
---
The dungeon hasn’t changed so much as character power level has risen to the point in live where it’s a joke.  Original ZF an uncoordinated group would die to the pyramid event or wipe at the cave boss because the tank couldn’t tank 3-5 things at once. It’s not nearly as neutered as what they did to ST
---
&gt;The only cool thing about Deathwing is his Hearthstone card.
---
I lost it here. I AM POWER INCARNATE
---
That the ai is so crappy you don't even need hamstring because they just chase you without really doing any damage. (Not sure, that's my guess)
---
&gt; I'll put money on Classic being more balanced in the DPS classes than private servers were
---
Classic will be LESS balanced in the DPS classes than private servers are. Most pservers have buffed armor (4600 for bosses), if classic goes with the blizzlike 3700 then melee will do even more damage.
---
I have never felt that escape artist is that impactful on a warlock. The thing it's best used for is dispeling frost nova, but your felhunter can do that most of the time anyway. Rogue is a locks biggest counter and if you can get him out of stealth, you're at a significant advantage. The Int bonus is very negligible especially for PvP. The engineering bonus is also negligible. It's useful almost exclusively for the arcanite dragonling level increase. Basically, humans have one useful racial against your biggest counter, gnomes have several racials that are useful all of the time. Also, gnomes are ugly. 
---
Is there a source for that "true fact" you're talking about?  
---
Perhaps a study?  
---
I wanted Druid because of the flexibility and because I plan to PvP a bunch and they look super fun. 
---
Maybe I'm just a bad warrior, but hamstring in pve for me is really just an oh shit button I use for getting out of something sticky.
---
Wrath babies unite! 
---
Yes. You might not do all the raids, but even with 10-12 hours you could probably do the easier raids. 
---
Their class quests are super immersive :D 
---
For that specific quest item, I think it would be worse if they changed it before the gates were opened. If everyone was able to loot the head, you'd still be faced with the silithid carapace req grind. if 40x the number of people are out there farming it will be way way more time consuming/expensive to start the scepter shard quests. Instead of one group camping a cave, it will be one group per insect spawn location. They changed his head to be lootable by the whole raid after the gates were already opened and there was another, instanced way to grind rep quickly in AQ. And if you changed the carapace drops to be available to everyone with the commission, then you've taken away the prestige and the uniqueness of one of the most famous quest lines in all of WoW. 
---
&gt;but I'm a firm believer that hard work should be the factor in progression, and not RNGesus for quests. Especially when you are competing with 39 other people.
---
I agree with that as well, but this quest isn't really about progression. it's a feather in your cap. It's like Baron mount or ZG tiger.  Most people in most guilds wont want to loot the head because they know they can't/wont do the grind needed to finish it. So it will be between you and a handful of people. If you put in hard work in your guild and talk to the officers about how you want to go for it, then it's likely they'll give you one of the first heads. 
---
1. figure out where the streamers are going
---
2. go somewhere else
---
Our guild name in wotlk was 
---
&lt;Get Lich or Die Tryin&gt;
---
I wasn't a gamer when I started playing.
---
I'll never forget: Me and my mates were having a house party and they had the South Park episode Make Love Not Warcraft playing.
---
Suddenly a bunch of drunk metal head stoners got curious and formed a guild.
---
We all sucked by the way. Great times.
---
4/1/2019 Blue Notes: After careful contemplation and the player's experience first in mind, we have decided to add RDF / LFR to Classic. 
---
As of now, Ion has said that here will be 16 slots from the beginning.
---
I think it should be 8 slots for MC and BWL.  
---
Lets hope Blizzard has the sense to do it.
---
I dunno. Every streamer I've heard mention wants to go pvp
---
That price fixing scheme is deliciously evil. 
---
Was that the dialogue from the South Shore Inn in Caverns of Time?
---
&gt;me to my wife: "This will test us."
---
Go ahead and start having an affair now. I am going to need you out of the house more. 
---
I killed a lvl 60 raid geared rogue on my lvl 45 hunter once. He killed me first, then I spotted him killing another lowbie as I resurrected, so I marked him... proceeded to kite him to death and he could do nothing about it.
---
It was hilarious. His anger and frustration must've been endless.
---
I don't think that's a sure thing. Devkits usually go out before launch.
---
I'd rather not. We're already going to be using 1.12 talents, which is far more impactful than 8 debuff slots.
---
Cows need room to graze.
---
Having excitement is okay, but don't go overboard.  The people bringing up potential problems have great points, and nostalgia blinding people is very very very very fucking real.  I intend to play Classic, but as someone who played Vanilla I won't deceive myself about what this game actually is.  
---
There's a reasonable chance that this sub is the next /r/NoMansSky
---
I believe the consensus is that 8 slots was a technical limitation at the time and Classic is launching with 16 slots because Blizzard is trying to minimize pointless changes in later content patches.
---
What impact this has on early raid balance has to be seen. Too little is known overall to judge it without testing.
---
Every streamer ive heard does not.  If they have any following at all they will have just as many haters that will gank on site turning everything outside of a major city into massive pvp and they cant get anything else done.
---
Although I like Durotar, I don't care for Valley of Trials and especially don't care for Sen'jin Village. Having to swim to those island keys just seems so tedious. It picks up at Razor Hill though.
---
Mulgore and Deathknell just feel so much easier.
---
Deathknell staight to Brill. Love Brill.
---
Spell batching was a technical limitation.  
---
Don't be a baby maybe?
---
I'm a Horde Player but I'll sometimes make a Night Elf just to experience Teldrassil. That place is straight up from my dreams. I love how the boundaries from the zone are just hills that grow steeper as you climb them. Straight up dreamscape.
---
He talks about the pathing of the mobs, which impacts how efficient kiting would be compared to pservers/vanilla. Not the best example since there is no hamstring but the AI is definitely different from Vanilla on top of hamstring kiting not working correctly in the demo. 
---
&gt; The hamstring method isn’t the same. It seems that every time that the mob melee range is too short or that hamstring slow is not applying the appropriate slow amount, or both. It feels like when you strafe the mob runs right onto your character instead of attacking from a little bit away, meaning when you try to string and walk away the mob is already too close and you never get out of range. If it's not slowed enough, you'll never be able to out range it
---
- From the [demo feedback megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9ubyr6/wow_classic_demo_feedback_bugs_and_legion/)
---
Im excited for skill to be more of a factor and gear to be less. On the private server i play on I can see how outdated gear gets (because you aren't getting gear from dungeon ques and whatnot) so i'll be level 31 but my gear is anywhere from 22 to 31.
---
That being said, you actually CAN kill people several levels above you if you're good at your class and if they're gear is out of date. This makes world pvp more unpredictable and makes it worth it to go all in on people (even if they gank you).
---
World PvP is really memorable because it isn't even. Ganking someone 5 levels above you as a rogue because they're fighting mobs and killing them feels dirty, but it also feels right, like you're sticking it to the other faction.
---
Blizzard, hear my thoughts! Consider inbetween the lines!
---
You know you can call Blizz greedy without being antisemitic right?
---
Different topic and influenced by player feedback.
---
"That depends. We roleplaying or...?"
---
Cuz they are lazy bastards that don't like farming rep.  Also swords
---
But this was also a case of them needing to meet a deadline that they never should have announced, and they should have pushed back. BFA had to be released in it's total shit unfinished state because once a release date is announced, the company takes a stock hit if they don't meet it. So it's basically forced crunch after a release date is announced. It's kind of a rock/hardplace issue, because people were dropping like flies after Legion just sort of dried up after a relatively promising start, and it was clear new content was needed. 
---
This is so true. Never forget that time Glowing Brightwood staff dropped for me from a random Yeti kill in Winterspring. Looking forward to vanilla so much. Still can't decide what to roll though.
---
Some solutions are simple, such as 8 debuff slots, and some solutions are not simple, such as pre1.12 talents.  
---
8 debuff slots is low hanging fruit.  
---
Maybe we can choose whichever pvp server comes first alphabetically. And pve players can do the same 
---
This is why zero sum DKP is my favorite.  Top DKP priest when Prophecy drops?  You get that piece, but you drop back down to zero.  It ensures rotation.  One person cant get all the gear through auction, and everyone slowly gets better.
---
The big issue is when all of a class is waiting on something and wants to pass on a piece of gear that would be good for any of them (ex priests passing on Proph. In MC in hopes for getting the benediction item).  Have to put rules in place as to whether this is allowed, or whether you force the gear on someone as its better for the group for people to get geared, and then do they go to zero or is there some other 'fee' taken.
---
It isnt perfect, but it worked the best when I was raiding.
---
murdered a large group of night elves that were having some weird sex cult ritual in darkwhisper gorge
---
logged in once and saw this random female tauren mooing a lot
---
then some level 1 logged in between her legs and she started screaming about her new baby
---
weird shit man
---
*Consciously 
---
&gt;GDKP
---
That is a horrible acronym, but good to see its been considered and documented before.  
---
A player is literally trying to start the conversational feedback about 8 debuff slots.  
---
Why is it a different topic if it's a concern regarding vanilla authenticity?  
---
I will for ever be a happy fella if I manage to acquire X'caliboar from RFD. 
---
Equipping Arcanite Reaper is a marvelous feeling.
---
Ironfoe always will be a dream weapon for me.

Winning Zin'Rokh in a ZG pug. Mhm :3
---
Using my +1 roll in an MC pug to win Bonereaver's Edge or Onslaught Girdle or Flameguard Gauntlets? 180 heartrate inc.
---
Loot tables switched around si noone knows what drops where.
---
Young? Debatable. By age 19, I felt like I had to have my shit together in order to survive. So I didn't feel so young.
---
But now I'm 30 and I feel younger and healthier. It's great.
---
Never
---
Just posted about how a similar situation could occur, and its definitely something that needs to be talked about and agreed upon prior to raiding.

I actually had to get my mom to make me a batch of tendies to help get over this. Feelsbadman

Stay on target dude.
---
Lol that's clever doesn't deserve a ban
---
They are probably done in the sense of the product works now -- but there are additional complications to be worked out I imagine like how the game handles a huge influx of players in one zone. Vanilla WoW shit the bed so hard during launch for reasons that were understandable and justifiable in 2004. But in 2019 if the whole game is broken for a week or two because there's just an absurd number of people returning to play, that could really do a lot of damage. I would hope that Blizzard has classic WoW pretty much done, and is mainly on the stress testing / optimization portion of the project
---
The hill to die one was referencing him saying classic won't be classic unless he gets unarmored mounts in the first content phase.  It's taking a relatively small thing and putting it on the devs to either do it, or he won't consider it authentic. 
---
Secondly, why does he bother mentioning spell batches in his post then? It's irrelevant to what he's talking about. He only used it to imply that blizzard didn't announce/put in something he considers more important.
---
I think it's 6 right? I may be mistaken, it's just what I saw somewhere else.
---
Definitely not. I never gank anyone 4+ levels below me, and I hated what flying did to world PvP.
---
And if you take issue with people attacking you when you're within three levels... Why choose a pvp server? 
---
Zero-Sum DKP.  Want a piece of gear?  It costs all of your DKP.  This ensures everyone gets gear (strong as the weakest link so on and so forth)
---
&gt; I'd rather not. We're already going to be using 1.12 talents, which is far more impactful than 8 debuff slots.
---
I agree with that, but at the same time we are phasing in the raids at various points. No one is going to be running a 1.12 raid in Phase 1, so why not add a bit to the authenticity with a simple change like 8 debuff slots?
---
Is it 8 so debilitating that too many classes would be impacted by it?
---
I'm not arguing for 8 or 16, but just trying to figure out what would be better for the game. With regards to talents, the level of effort to recreate 30 old talent trees is clearly far more difficult than lowering the debuff slots to 8. That's why I don't think they are comparable.
---
i still can't believe some started in cata and stuck with the game
---
You really have to work cut out for you if your going down the feral Druid tank route.   I had one as my alt and the battles your going to to have to get a raid slot.  (They are not bad but arms warrior is most of the time better for less investment).  
---
We should honestly start compiling a list so that we can react appropriately.
---
That sounds very convenient! Can you stream anything from your pc or only steam? Also do you notice much latency? I assume there would be some concidering it's streaming we are talking about but does it affect gameplay alot?
---
&gt; 8 debuff slots is low hanging fruit.
---
And far less impactful than 1.12 talents and spells.
---
When i last tried a private server the amount of damage rend does for the rage early levels is useless. Better off just doing another heroic strike, even with imp rend due to the limited rage you generate early on. 
---
Not really. Just load up with materials for a month worth of transmutes and move it back to town when you need to restock.
---
Nope. They learn summon at level 20, and Vanilla dont have any restrictions like that. If you have the spell you can use it.
---
Irony goes full-circle and people roll female night elves for double-irony points. Gotta love it. 
---
Found the guy who plays a female Night Elf.
---
Rather than make up hypothetical scenarios, I will stand by that you should look at the evidence and make a conclusion from that. 
---
Not simply make blanket statements and discuss possible scenarios that could lead to an invalid time.
---
So something that is easy to do but is impactful, just not *as* impactful, shouldn't be done?
---
Yes its a private server bug sorry to burst your bubble
---
Same with warlocks really. But 1-10 and the petquest is much less of a hassle than hunters. If you intend to level a bunch of alts you can enchant a skinning knife with 30 spellpower, some white gloves with 20 shadow damage, and some white boots with movement speed and just trade it around before eventually selling them on the AH.
---
But the limit of 8 debuffs has far less impact on the game. It's barely going to be an issue whatsoever. It's completely bizarre to me to champion for raid mechanics to change for a single phase of the game (and therefore confusing new comers) but yet be perfectly fine with the *much larger difference* of 1.12 spells and talents.
---
I want a Reddit server too
---
It's not a bannable exploit lmao.
---
True, however 1 drop per week will still cause a fuss lol
---
&gt; This isn't likely a discussion open to debate anymore.
---
You don't really get to make that choice.  
---
I posted this idea [2 months ago](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/adupkd/seamless_server_merges_a_way_to_merge_low/).
---
I wont argue it, the pandas just broke the spell WoW had on me. Thematically it made me angry, coupled with the shifted focus on cash shop shit.
---
Not true. World first level 70 got to maxlevel using mobtagging.
---
don't know how it will look like. 
---
here is his website : [https://www.joanasworld.com/](https://www.joanasworld.com/) if you want to have a look.
---
Not as common as Mohammed.
---
&gt;Dun Morogh to Valley of Kings in Loch Modan
---
Yeah I will always remember this. The huge dwarf king statues and the change from the snowy beauty to this green, sunny expanse was amazing. To this day the dwarven architecture and theming is my favorite, pretty much across all video games and representations. 
---
TBH I've yet to find a reliable private server that had same vanilla values for respawn and xp gain. I remember waiting for an hour for a quest mob in duskwood in 2005 and having to compete with everyone for it. 
---
But honestly is it really impactful at all? What's really going to change for a single phase of the game to limit to 8 debuffs?
---
I just don't understand why people want to fight for the 8 debuff slots in a *very* small part of the game, but yet are completely fine with the *massive* change it's going to be to have 1.12 talents.
---
So I've been told. Lol my buddy is so set on trying to do the impossible when classic comes out. Sad thing is, he never attempted it in vanilla.
---
yeah, that's what i thought too? but people here act like it's almost necessary and i wasn't sure if it was just a minmaxing thing or if they cracked the code and warrior leveling is miserable without it. thankfully going off of those replies it doesn't seem to be necessary
---
I'm the opposite. I feel like people that choose Male Nightelf... especially a druid are complete weirdos. Gotta be something mentally wrong with you to choose a male nightelf, unless you're a memer to the max. I group people that choose a male nightelf into the same group of people that stand up to wipe their ass.
---
But that's just me.
---
This needed an extra panel for the updated content release schedule.
---
female gnome warrior.  
---
I just want to see these facts he's talking about.  
---
It is IMO the best zone for pure experience and story and humor, it's really just very "in line" with the things I loved about WC3's mix of serious ponderous themes spliced with humor / comic relief. 
---
Every other zone is a little more "well the gnolls attacked our pumpkin patch, whatever shall we do!" Whereas the undead are like "fuck everyone, you're a piece of shit, go fight for your right to exist"
---
&gt;To fully level up an alchemist alt you'll be spending 200-300 gold for materials, recipees, skills etc.
---
How do you figure? The herbs you need to get to the level where you unlock transmutes are herbs you dont need for anything else at 60. On pservers it usually costs just shy of 60g to level alchemy high enough. Thats a week of transmutes and you start making gold.
---
Not to mention you need two Lionheart Helms (Fire res + 100HP)
---
So, besides Classic, I really think "Seasonal" realms could be cool. As each xpac has lasted about 24 months, to maintain a sense of urgency each xpac's seasonal realm could be compressed into a 12 month content release cycle running from summer to summer. Unique titles would be awarded to characters who completed milestones during these seasons--i.e. killing the Lich King on Heroic in this compressed cycle could award the "the Lich King" title to that character--and then, at the end of the season, Seasonal characters would be offered a free realm transfer to the main game.
---
Pros: Nostalgia; fast-paced and urgent gameplay for everyone, not just the world-first racers; unique titles that, while accessible to all, give meaning to individual characters once again rather than just different classes on an account
---
Cons: this is r/wowclassic not r/wowbadideas and nobody cares
---
If you could spend any extra time early on when you’re a somewhat recent 60 to farm gold and invest in things that will drastically increase price in future patches, it would go along towards accruing wealth and therefore reducing time spent farming for consumables in the future. 
---
Regardless it wont be the same in classic
---
My god I miss this so much.
---
It's like the in-game equivalent of the head-nod when passing a stranger in a hallway.
---
Wall walking/hopping and exploring using nogginfogger potions. Using "auto-unstuck" to get to the secret zone under deadmine as a horde hunter was really memorable, as well as swimming under iron forge and kitting dragons to orgrimar. 
---
Can't say the name?
---
It's never that simple and every fight is different. Please keep your generalizations to yourself. There is a reason hardcore guilds don't have a raid spot for feral. They are a overall inefficient raid spot after a certain point in Vanilla. I had a great friend that had DFT as a bear tank + near BiS feral gear through Naxx, and played alongside him for some time. This is not condemning bear tanks.
---
Don't get me wrong those feelings of getting those weapons that will last you 10 odd levels are GREAT! lol and then seeing the scale of your DPS or healing jump is magical... but that first time when you knew nothing about the game.. or what your next piece of gear is going to be is oof
---
Why is 10min the cutoff for $?
---
Engineering means you just wasted a profession cooldown though.
---
I appreciate your opinion. I never raided in Vanilla when the 8-debuff limit as in effect so I don't have strong opinions on this issue, just mostly questions.
---
 Well, after reading your post I just looked directly for some, but it's really time consuming to look for all the quest turning backs and compare anything with Joanna's 240p (144p sometimes I swear ...) quality. I just rapidly found a couple examples, far from the 25% difference I mentionned before though I admit.
---
Here there's a Sham leveling on Nost (can't write full name here) in Stonetalon : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5fsvcOcR2I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5fsvcOcR2I) ( 1 )
---
Here's Joanna doing the same : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUAbNkBmBHE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUAbNkBmBHE) ( 2 )
---
At 1 : 58 : 08 (1) and 18:54 (2) they give back Shredding machines : Joanna gets 1850XP and the Sham gets 1900.
---
At 2 : 03 : 09 (1) and 19:36 (2, put in 0.25 speed and spam space to get a good quality frame, look at the chat box eventually) they give back Arachnophobia : Sham gets 1700 and Joanna gets 1600.
---
I obviously checked wether they were in the level range of the quests to be certain Joanna didn't get a malus because she was a couple levels higher that the sham ( [https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Experience\_point](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Experience_point) ) : they don't, they're both right in the middle of the level range of these quests.
---
Now this difference might be small, but it already shows you that PServers values are approximated. Also keep in mind these were very popular and easy leveling quests on which there's probably more info that on many other less known ones, so these XP values inaccuracies might be magnified later on.
---
Then again, I won't watch the whole 1-60 leveling of two different guys just to answer there, but I remember there was a Dwarf Hunt on Ely si um (or was it L H already ?) who broke that 4 days bar about 1.5 years ago and who frapsed the whole gameplay, and people noted that he had Boosted XP rates compared to retail Joanna's videos. You'd have to dig that out for more info, can't help more.
---
I'm not fine with the 1.12 talents, but I also know when a fight is hopeless.  
---
Also I want 8 debuff slots for two phases, as my message said.  
---
There are 4chan servers? What a horrible thought.
---
That’s awesome how did you guys get caught?
---
Or in their 40s and now retired
---
/cough
---
What are you talking about. Mobtagging is a Blizzlike Vanilla feature.
---
A lot is said about the advantage of 16 slots over 8, but this change is really trivial compared to hundreds of other changes made by the time you get to 1.12. It's just one of the more visible changes. Every boss received some kind of nerf, gear was itemized much better, tons of quality of life compared to pre 1.4. I was going to make a detailed list but it's daunting when you start looking at it. And some things like bugs and exploits you won't want them to recreate, so there is a line in the sand that has to be drawn. 
---
The first people in mc this time around will have a much easier time than those from 2005. I'm kinda ok with that. It would be fun for sure to replay it and have it be an actual challenge, but it's the first raid and will make it more accessible for more people. And all those advantages go away by the time aq comes out because those were tuned with all those changes in mind. 
---
I was 32 when I started WoW back in Vanilla. I was already a gamer, mainly Diablo 2, Warcraft, and had about 1 year of a Korean MMO under my belly before 2005.
---
Once I for the Vanilla "virus"...it was over for all MMORPGs out there for me. With one exception : EvE Online.
---
I think that Classic have a massive potential in changing gaming industry. But it depends both on popularity (which will be yuuuge anyway) and Blizzard's approach to "what is after Classic".
---
Will see how thing will unfold...
---
no idea but now i’m curious
---
Actually, it looks like that would be 3 phases, as BWL seems to be in:
---
&gt; Phase 3
---
&gt; Blackwing Lair  
---
&gt; Darkmoon Faire  
---
&gt; Darkmoon deck drops begin
---
I get what you're saying though. I just feel that if we're going to be stuck with 1.12 talents, we might as well do the 1.12 debuff limits as well to keep consistency across the board.
---
Teldrassil. The barrow den . . . Night Elves grow up fast! Mulgore may be home, but Teldrassil is unbeatable as a starting experience.
---
This is the answer right here boys.  
---
I'll accept it when Joana does it on Classic.  Till then, only records pre Jan 2007 are ones I'll consider valid.  All that's happening now is practice.
---
The previous cm got fired and the new guy is way better
---
Well horses didnt go away when the car was invented, but we still say that cars replaced horses.
---
If you have more than one guy in your guild going for scarab lord, then chapeau. The rest who won't bang the gong at the AQ opening can finish the questline for the rewards later on without banging it.
---
Vanilla is a game of patience.
---
I agree.  Im just saying mobtagging is different in private servers.
---
I gotcha. My only thing is I don't want to scare of new players (which I guess would be you too! :D) so I'm concerned about consistency across raids. If we're going to be using the 1.12 talents, I feel like we should also use the 1.12 debuff slots.
---
Yea this is absolutely awesome
---
I haven't played private servers - what sort of server caps did/do they have?
---
No one knows yet. 
---
Not to mention that DKP rarely helps the guild. The guy who has been collecting DKP for months because he already had the best items before he joined the guild can use his DKP on a second Ancient Qiraji Ripper. Meanwhile the other warrior still dps with Dal'Rend weapons.
---
I think maybe you should examine your own biases. There's much more to a MMORPG than raiding. 
---
I do this currently, but I play Diablo 2 LoD through my TV. I just used a HDMI cable and plugged my old CPU to my TV. Works good but I've only play single player, haven't tried any high performance games.
---
People stream WoW?
---
Patience I know all to well. However wanting that title and that mount, patience is a luxury when there is a time limit.
---
Tell her you'll cover next months rent if she leaves you alone for the next few weeks
---
idk what the downvotes are for, just saying its a rare combo
---
We had the same situation on a private server I played on. The guild forced fury warriors to take tank pieces for minimum DKP bid, which meant that Rogues were free to collect all the shared DPS trinkets, rings, amulets and weapons.
---
Let's just say I didnt stay there long.
---
Sounds like we can do without those kinds of servers then
---
Honestly they should just put them in and leave them in. Less ridiculously armoured mounts running around the better. 
---
[It was a Disney dungeon quest dialogue.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oEWA7UglB4)
---
Not worrying about it till there’s a release date and server list?
---
You'll take one shadow priest for the locks.  Fury is strong dps, plus you need a lot of warriors for some fights to tank.
---
Better not to forget Classic wont see its first BG during phase 1. So all the PvP will happen in the open, same as the early days of Vanilla, were we did not had DHKs !
---
&gt;I honestly have no idea why people don’t just bid using gold with the idea that whoever wins the bidding pays the lootmaster their bid, which then gets sent to the raid in equal shares
---
Alright. Lets completely screw over anyone who plays alts or have twinks or goes the extra mile buying flasks for raid DPS, while the guy who only logs in every wednesday for the raid will have infinite gold.
---
In general, I doubt the memes will change in any real way so expect the usual difficulties for some classes. They are either tryhard and earn a spot, or go back to heal spec.
---
I am curious about early Shadow Priest due to 16 debuff slots right out of the door. At least for casual guilds. I'd love to see one in early raids if only for something different.
---
I cite my one man study of having played wow for 13 years and meeting thousands of players. I specifically remember the guys in high school who played night elf females. Not the most well adjusted people around.
---
It's just a joke though man, i'm sure there are normal people who play it too.
---
Yeah let's get everyone from this subreddit to join one realm, so I can make sure to join a different one.
---
Hi, /u/davidxela
---
I'll even take the casting animations at this point. After playing retail, I LOVE the changes to the casting animations 
---
I was going to ask in the questions thread the other day if this may happen. It seems like an official unofficial /r/classicwow server would be a great idea. I guess the only hazard is once it's disclosed which server it would be, it likely would be invaded by major streamers because it would be de facto the highest populated and most likely to prevail long term.
---
If the mods here are uncomfortable with endorsing a particular server maybe they could put up a sticky with an strawpoll listing all the servers once the list of names is announced, and then people can see which one gets the most votes to serve as the unofficial reddit home.
---
&gt;Which honestly bums me out, because from my experience with Classic so far it's a pretty solid solo experience if you like a challenge
---
...This is the biggest problem with my WoW friends. Anytime they hit a tiny difficulty spike, they just give up or complain endlessly. 
---
I'm not going to rag on modern WoW, but why should leveling/questing be considered a boring as shit grind? *Isn't that boring??* Why don't you want some difficulty or roadblocks to get past? Isn't that the point of video games?? To work out issues on your own (or with a group) and have the satisfaction of completing it? If everything is just given to you on a stick... what's the point? 
---
I can stream anything from my pc, I've set up specific games to open(convenient when using a controller) as well as just opening to the desktop .
---
The connection speed is important, when I first set it up I connected to my 2.4 ghz wifi band and was only getting \~10 mb/s connection which was really laggy, found out not all raspberry pi's have 5ghz wifi, grabbed a newer one I also had and set it up on 5ghz which gave me \~80 mb/s connection to my pc and I can't really tell and latency issues, but I haven't used it much. I use the older raspberry pi with only the 2.4 ghz wifi with a ethernet connection the most at 100 mb/s at 60fps and I haven't had latency or lag issues.
---
t word?
---
And it is obvious why it isn't like so in private servers and it's also a well documented change.
---
&gt;Obviously assuming equal footing which is a bad* assumption in classic
---
Hadn't played mage in 3 years, btw.
---
Hadn't ever played against a gnome warrior, btw.
---
Are we talking release or 6 months in?
---
Personally I'd like as large as possible, but its going to be insane without sharding for the first 3 months.
---
not a new player, just didn't hit 60 until late Vanilla. I did a ton of raiding in TBC.
---
PvE —&gt; PvP never existed in classic.
---
Everything is viable, but only fury is optimal.
---
Feral can be somewhat optimal if you're willing to farm gnomer for several hours before each raid, but I doubt many people will do that.
---
All I am saying is that just because the run is 1 day shorter on a private server, doesn't say definitively that it is caused by inaccuracies in the private server. I am not saying the run is valid or invalid. 
---
broadly, there are fewer stupid names.
---
Otherwise there's no difference than a non-RP server unless you join an RP guild that does events.
---
There is only one who can get the mount in any superhardcore guild. You will not have 5 people being forcefeed 4000 elite mobs each. 
---
The one going for scarab lord will get a head, the rest will stay in line and will farm their rep for the rewards later on in AQ40. The 2nd, 3rd... 20th guy acquiring the head prior to the gates opening will be in the tunnels grinding elite mobs to support the one aspiring scarab lord.
---
Edgy
---
My thought is that you're not all going to be able to grind out for the 16K silithid drops you need in time for the AQ gates opening.
---
If you're not trying to get the mount, then you'll eventually get the head as long as you are a good raider.
---
is it 4K? I thought it was a lot more. 
---
4K sounds like a piece of cake.
---
Where /vg/ server?
---
Nice. I was more of a Robocop/Total Recall kid so I wasn't sure where the over-the-top quote was from. Pocahontas. Good film.
---
No doubt, but I believe that's why he's saying blizzard server times shouldn't be held to the same standard as private server. Obviously it's a huge QOL adjustment for the better.
---
Exactly.  I'm just not going to worry or fuss about it.  It worked pretty well for me the first time around.
---
It's a very improbable feat to do yes. However don't forget the title is also sought after. In the long run it might be a pipe dream. But if a group is dedicated enough, you'll get it... If you don't want to sleep lol. It's unfortunate that the rep gridding isn't available before the event.
---
/r/IAm30AndThisIsDeep ? 
---
I'm going to loose my fucking mind when I see that blue post stickied on top the forums. 
---
Multiple level 60s on three different private servers, 15 years waiting and hoping for this to happen.  I will immediately call my boss and schedule an entire week off. I will do nothing that week besides gym, shower, eat and play world of warcraft.
---
This sounds gay as fuck, but this is a once in a lifetime opportunity and I plan to make the most of it.
---
Respawn rates are pretty off too. [Popular server that starts with an R that mods won't even allow to even be named lol] respawn rates for instance are quite fast. Presumably because people don't like waiting.
---
.....what?
---
Indeed, however the fighting starts on whom will have that privilege.
---
&lt;Consecration Camp&gt;
---
I second this.  I would love to be able to change my chars hairstyle every once in a while.  I’ve literally seen people argue that it breaks THEIR immersion. That’s just silly. 
---
Sure we can prove things - that is the fun part where numbers become involved. Please enlighten me on the vast PvP advantages and utility of arms leveling over fury 1-39. In the meantime, let's break it down from a PvP perspective then:
---
Fury Utility 1-39
---
Piercing Howl - 10 yard aoe slow, great for pvp
---
Blood Craze - Self heal on receiving crit
---
Enrage - 25% dmg boost on being crit, massive
---
Deathwish - Immunity to fear and 20% dmg increase for 30 secs, gg locks
---
Imp Intercept - if you so desire to sacrifice dmg talents for utility
---
Arms Utility 1-39
---
Imp Charge - +6 rage assuming you get the jump, but as a warrior that won't be the case most likely
---
Tactical Mastery - pre-30 limited use if you want to sit in defensive stance while you get killed or something, post-30 can swap zerker to battle for overpower procs
---
Imp Overpower - very nice against rogues
---
Anger Management - good but typically pvp fights are very brief so won't get much rage from it
---
Sweeping Strikes - ??? Deathwish at same level in fury tree blows this out of the water.
---
Imp Hamstring - can't access until lvl 35...
---
Please don't compare rage generation on a low level warrior to rogue energy with a BF and SS comparison. It makes you look really dumb. BF costs a penny to a SS dollar. Apple to Oranges much?
---
Alright mr moneybags
---
It makes perfect sense to me - get good at PvP, get the best PvP gear. Get good at PvE, get the best PvE gear. Nothing stopping you from doing both and acquiring 2 sets of gear, but you're not required to do one activity to succeed at the other.
---
As opposed to Vanilla where raid gear trumps everything. I still love Vanilla PvP, but for different reasons than TBC. Having a skill-based PvP mode was fantastic. The Vanilla PvP rank system was pretty objectively awful and did not serve as a reasonable alternative. 
---
What exactly are you saying? I'm probably just stupid but im finding it hard to follow this disagreement. From what I understand he is saying we should take this speed run time with a grain of salt because the variable differences are unknown because it's a private server. And you're upset because he doesn't know what the differences are so he shouldn't think that? 
---
What don’t you understand?
---
Or is this more of the blind hatred on anything that isn’t classic and mass downvote on anyone expressing any like of new stuff?
---
Yeah I think it would be cool ! Depending on what type of guild it would be I could see it working out
---
I know I won't, because I have a life next to WoW. :D
---
Are you an officer, preferably the raidlead/guild master? Can you play 18hours a day for weeks? No? You are not eligible.
---
I shed a tear. We are soon home brothers 
---
I think he’s referring to the fact that finding groups in modern WoW is frequently done using the “group finder” tool. Basically, you can just afk and wait until the game finds a group for your dungeon, then you teleport directly to the dungeon with your new group mates. In classic, you had to find group members in chat or your guild, and you had to actually travel together to the dungeon, sometimes over long distances. It’s hard to explain if you’ve never played wow or other MMOs, but the group finder is a huge part of why there is less community to the game now, as well as much less incentive to speak to others or actually go out into the game world. 
---
Ganking is as close to PvP as doing quests is PvE.
---
When it’s actually a fair fight it’s fun.
---
Basically all bad except for fury which is one of, if not the strongest dps spec throughout vanilla. Cat is ok just because extra off tanks can come in handy and they might as well do something when not tanking, and shadow is ok if you can't convince any holy priests to keep up shadow weaving. The rest are garbage.  
---
Elemental shamy would be pretty fun in dungeons if you didn't run out of mana instantly. You do pretty good dps for one pack but then the warriors/rogues will run ahead clearing the next two while you're drinking. Really for dungeons the optimal group for every 60 dungeon is a healer and the rest dps warriors. There's no heroics so there's nothing a warrior can't tank dps gear if they have some decent blues, and really no class comes close to the cleave dps of warriors.
---
He edited his post to remove the quote I was replying to where he basically said that since the speed run time wwnt down by 1 day it must be caused by private server inaccuracies. 
---
"From what I understand he is saying we should take this speed run time with a grain of salt because the variable differences are unknown because it's a private server."
---
I agree.
---
Right. And flying got rid of most of that fun. 
---
Course one thing some of my old guild mates agree on for the classic sever is this. Why not keep the title and mount available without a timer. Or have some sort of year to 2 year deadline?
---
Honestly keeping them should give players dedication to complete it. Ffs it's a huge feat on it's own. Without a time window the title and mount will still be rare to see.
---
What are you trying to ask me here?
---
Yeah, Classic will be the number one game on twitch when it launches. It won't stay there for long, but it will be there for a bit. 
---
Really no interest in PvP outside of random fun stuff. Will be focused on raiding.
---
All serious guilds will have a spot for one shadow priest. That's generally included in min-maxed builds.
---
The rest of those specs will just need to find a casual guild to play in. We get a warped perspective of the game here on Reddit but most people who played in vanilla never really raided hardcore.
---
I’m all-in on Druid. Got a core group of friends to do 5-man BiS runs with, and I’ll be feral tanking so get to decide who joins and gets what. The “hard” part of gearing will be getting 3 sets, but each individual piece comes at a quicker rate than the myriad of warriors and mage pieces, since there is almost zero competition for them outside of cat gear, which you’ll be sharing rolls with rogues on.
---
They absolutely rule at dueling.
---
And he healing/tanking aspect of raiding will be fine. No one doesn’t want MotW enough to say druids are suboptimal healers. You’re just more of a raid healer than a MT healer. And if you’re a full bear with Smoking Heart of the Mountain, who is *really* going to turn you down?
---
His hypocritical friends will be playing classic at launch when the initial boom happens.
---
It will not.
---
One of my favorites:
---
[Aegis of the Blood God](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/small/273545.jpg)
---
Horde RP. Well, if you manage to find 9 other player to go to bg.
---
The only reason I would ever make a Druid is because I could name him Bearzabub. Other then that, no thank you. Good luck though.
---
That doesn't affect anyone else except them. With what I'm suggesting, if those 2 people join a group of 40 and are the only 2 to tag the civilian then the other 38 are fine. Even if the healers kept those 2 alive it doesn't change anything except if the healer messes up and attacks the civilian. 
---
I might be reading it wrong, because that doesn't make any sense. Not trolling or flaming, but clarify it if I'm misunderstanding.
---
Anyone who kills my tiger will be made ded.
---
People stream any game. 
---
I'm glad to see people hyped about Classic that never played it but at the same time I just know in my heart of hearts that the majority of players such as yourself will most likely be the ones to stop playing before the 30 day mark never actually hitting 60. I hope that I'm wrong because the larger the player base is for Classic the better the communities will be and that's what made Vanilla great, the people.
---
Unfortunately they do. Which means if you don't want the most toxic shitlord server imaginable, you should avoid the server streamers play on.  
---
Ah okay, gotcha, thanks
---
Why, what’s wrong with streamers?
---
Balance is awful. Elemental will get a pass cause totems. One shadow per raid is pretty standard.
---
Many "serious" guilds have replaced the shadow priest with a holy weaver build where one of the healers is tasked with keeping the debuff up spamming R1 sw:pain, and that shadow priests slot can be taken by another warlock benefitting from the buff.
---
You have one person choose the server. An hour before release the name gets sent to everyone. You populate it quickly. 
---
Swampman good. Its all the same. 
---
Oh look an online asshole assuming that I'm 100% horrible at the game because I made a single mistake !  Wow, what a surprise.  I mean no one I  the history of the world has ever made a mistake right? But rather than any of you kindly correcting me, you decided to be self absorbed smug jackasses, and then you wonder why I'm hostile towards you???? 
---
And lastly (and I wish I could "talk slower" on the internet to get this across because it's always people like you who seem to skim over shit without reading it:
---
If. You. Are. Constantly.Kiting. As. A. Warrior. You. Are. Playing. The. Wrong. Class. 
---
Once again: it's a perfectly fine method of killing harder than normal mobs, but its ONLY saving grace is that it reduces downtime. BUT what the guides dont tell you is that increases kill time. 
---
This comes from someone who has played every role in nearly every major MMO since WoW came out. (Loremaster in a top raiding guild- Clan of Dereth for LOTRO, Main tank Sith Juggernaut in SWTOR, Paladin-Tank/OffTank in TBC, Shaman main in Vanilla and TBC running all 3 specs ar various points.)
---
I can undeniably tell you that while the warrior class CAN hamstring kite, it shouldn't.  The kill efficacy is sub par.  KITING can be done with nearly any class with a slow. But it's a better tool for classes that have ranged or DoT capabilities.  
---
I understand the swing timer. Unlike you I actually read the entire post.  But if you aren't in melee range you arent able to weave off-GCD skills.  Maybe this is less of a concern for WoW warriors. But I can tell you right now.  Your TTK for hamstring kiting is gonna be way longer than other classes.  And while it may save you downtime, that doesnt matter under specific circumstances.  
---
But back to my first point.  I almost got off base.  I'm not here to teach you the finer points of grinding.  I'll let you attempt to figure that out for yourself when you try to hamstring kite when classic launches...go right ahead bucko.
---
I'm here to tell you to fuck off.  Why? Cause you seem to think that because I made a singular mistake (I misunderstood a 15 year old games "cast skill" (stormstrike) for an AA reset, even though it in practice functions very similar to an AA reset) that makes me somehow horrible at all aspects of the game.
---
So next time you make a single mistake at ANYTHING I hope this post pops into your head and you tell yourself : "man I'm a piece of trash for even attempting whatever this is, I made a single mistake; I must quit this activity forever because god knows if I make a single mistake that must mean I'm bad at everything right?"
---
P.S.  Post History can tell you a lot about someone.  For example my post history will tell you IDGAF about the opinions of others.  I might be wrong, I might be right. But at the end of the day, I'm not here to be your friend. I'll be friendly toward you until you prove otherwise. Why? You're a self absorbed, smug, reddit jackass, who cant take the time of day to properly read a post and instead of correcting something in a friendly manner, you take the "You're an idiot" approach.
---
What my post history WON'T tell you is that I don't look at animated pictures of mostly/partially nude pre-pubescent females.  Why? Well for one I actually have a relationship with a real woman, not a pillow. And Two) if they weren't animated....and they were real humans it would be illegal.  But hey, keep defending the closet pedophiles over in the anime weeb subreddits.  I'm sure they need all the help they can get.
---
I played a priest for the first time in Wrath, leveled it as a late game alt just to better understand how they work so I could tank better. But really loved bubble-spamming Disc then. What changed between BC and Wrath that made them so fun? 
---
Juggling 5 sets of gear just to be unable to kill a pally in cloth and be unable to ress some rogue in ST and have them get lost trying to get back to the instance alone and then abandon the group yeah no thanks. Or how about dueling a warrior or rogue and your bash gets dodged and then your NG gets resisted. Yup fun times.   
---
Still got plenty of ptsd from vanilla druid, don't need any more.
---
Pservers have decided druids suck so you get downvoted for discussion on them
---
It's never "inefficient" to have a Feral tank if only because they don't need gear that other classes need. You can stack Warriors for max mitigation and DPS, but when you have 15 people who all want the same drops then they can play the lifetime of the game without seeing upgrades in certain slots. Aside from DFT, Druids want the trash drops that no one else wants - which helps your raid progress more quickly.
---
Oh my god is right.

Nothing's wrong with streamers. Their fans on the otherhand should be sterilized 
---
Lol someone is triggered holy fuck 
---
I think most people like Elwynn because It's feels so nostalgic. I've played many many characters over the years and never mained a human or any alliance race, but there's something magical about Elwynn Forest. I think a lot of it comes from the soundtrack, plus walking into the gates of Stormwind for the first time hearing that music kick in... It's enchanting. I wouldn't be surprised if that was the moment for many people that made them fall in love with Warcraft. Can't forget Hogger either, he's a legend.
---
There's a few ways to do it, and they'll all work in the end. There's even the spirit stacking staff welding warriors out there getting it done.
---
Been playing the past 11 years with only short breaks in between. When I go into something I go hard, to be honest my retail account may be forgotten for my Classic one. I never thought I could experience classic and now I can. I'm huge into RPGs, do tabletop each weekend and love the immersion. May take awhile but I will see you at level 60 
---
I guess I’ve never understood the allure of watching someone else play a game that I could instead play, you know instead of just watching. 
---
The important thing for classic is that if you can't be hard core when you play. Choose a class that doesn't need you to be to work. I would go with a mage or rogue. Both classes do a lot with a little bit. Even without raid gear you can pvp reasonably well on both classes
---
I've been really considering trying my hand at starting a small leveling/dungeon guild and am hoping to have people around my age (29) to just chill with and be able to laugh at our adventures.
---
Druidsong gulch! And being a quiet cat trying to steal AB flags. 
---
The title didn't exist in Vanilla. 
---
I have no idea what the window is supposed to be, was just using easy numbers for me to try to illustrate the idea.
---
Why can't they say when it WON'T be ready by?
---
In the panel he said it would be 16. 
---
He said the only reason that the game was ever even 8 to begin with was because the hardware back then wasn't powerful enough to handle having 16 debuffs on a target.  
---
Hey, not OP but I’d love to see his times if you want to post them or PM me! &lt;3
---
In 20 minutes.
---
You must of never did any PvP areas in TBC or been to IoD.
---
It's not a huge feat on its own after the gates are opened, because you can barrel roll through AQ and grind reputation in the raid itself. You dont need to endlessly farm bugs in the hives. Really, the single biggest achievement was guild cohesion. Did your guild have the perseverance to farm bugs for weeks in the tunnels or did some oter one outPvP/outfarmed you guys? 
---
The rest may be difficult but nowhere near the carapace part.
---
The mount is *supposed* to be rare. Have 5 people on each side get the scarab lord and this is more than enough.
---
The beauty of vanilla is that scrubs can pitch in (by farming carapaces and then selling them to a guild for example) but superhardcore nolifers still had their achievements like Scarab Lord, R14, server firsts etc. 
---
Dont take away from the neckbeards by casualising feats of strength.
---
Btw I'm a semi casual myself who don't want to see 150 people running around on the AQ mount.
---
I helped in parts of the questline and it's not that hard to farm some chimeras, raids, dragonkins, some open world bosses summoned for the event like Eranikus or Maws. The carapace make or break an aspiring scarab lord.
---
From what I've seen elsewhere it's 42k
---
So many things are were technical limitations. Stop using this fallacious logic over and over. Wether it was a technogical limitation or not is irrelevent. That is how the game was and the intent of this project is to replicate Vanilla as faithfully as possible.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Scarab_Lord
---
I think when the game launches there will be a lot of server/guild organization posts
---
...Warglaives? Icon of the Silver Crescent? Bloodlust Brooch? PvE gear is overpowered in TBC. That expansion tried to split up the gear paths, which 1) didn't work, and 2) made it so that your PvP gear is now nearly useless in every other aspect of the game. It's worse for PvP players in every way.
---
Classic should stay Classic and this suggested QoL goes against that. No thanks. Don't want it. Leave it as it was.
---
The real competition is your own faction. I would go gnome, because all my casters end up being gnome.
---
Classic succes -&gt; release tbc servers where you can transfer your character, so people wanting to stay in vanilla can stay, and people wanting tbc doesn't have their hard work vanished.
---
I'm all for leaving classic as it was, however like I said, some parts of vanilla was a shit show.
---
Each entitled to their opinion.
---
I’m in that boat I started in either late TBC or early Wrath can’t remember.
---
He didnt. Ion did when he confirmed it. 
---
Mind if I ask what your Vanilla raiding experience background is?
---
&gt;Im just saying mobtagging is different in private servers.
---
Different how? 
---
You will find plenty new in game don't worry ;D
---
Blizzard should name a Classic realm "Nostalrius" :D
---
Yeaaaah, except when Journey did that, there was extreme dynamic respawning and other exploits to abuse in order to level faster, not to mention that pserver to vanilla xp rates are not exactly accurate. 
---
Lol you've donated your money to streamers, haven't you? God that's really sad...
---
Haha the bash misses were tilting haha I feel ya. All good tho gl
---
I just want loot lag. 
---
If I’m tanking on two feet instead of kneeling, it just doesn’t feel like vanilla.
---
What did you expect though. Its a rerun. Take it for what its worth. 
---
I would have voted Tirisfal if it weren't for all the dang Forsaken. It and Silverpine are gorgeous otherwise.
---
I have a feeling the biggest demographic will be in their 20s.
---
Go back in your hole you sad fuck, god damn. What’s sad is your regard for a legit job and occupation. Nobody wants you here. 
---
If the game is built using modern client pruned back wouldn’t modern addons in theory work. 
---
I’m fairly certain the server-side changes to database structure are going to render all existing addons broken.
---
The reason I am asking about this is because I would play ranged damage dealer if I was to play WoW Classic. It looks like Shadow can be viable, in addition to the "pure" ranged classes, while Balance and Elemental are lacking.
---
The specs I am currently considering are Shadow and Marksmanship. I think I could feel good about doing dungeons and possibly raids with those.
---
Man, early-mid wrath was so f\*king fun... I miss that the most.
---
It had a huge community, I'll give you that
---
Or, you enable the other person to actually do more damage if its say with a caster that would otherwise suffer from a lot of pushback, or with a shaman granting windfury to a warrior- pushing your kill time to over twice as fast as a solo kill and ensuring your safety in the world if you're on a PvP server.
---
&gt; Even if the healers kept those 2 alive it doesn't change anything except if the healer messes up and attacks the civilian.
---
That's not really fair, and my point. If DKs are supposed to make it so that low level players etc can still play by having that deterrent, then allowing heals (not healers in my op) not rend DKs defeats that. Like the example, 2 Dkers being kept alive by a bunch of healers who recieve no negative repercussions is silly. Buut on the other hand, if I do an AOE heal or whatever, then someone gets a DK, why am I punished?
---
Thus just removing DKs and just not allowing the people Blizz don't want dying to die is better from virtually every angle. DKs were a terrible fix to a small problem.
---
It was the biggest.
---
Lol so you didn't deny that you give away your money to streamers. I can't imagine how sad it is to be in a parasocial relationship and not realize it. 
---
Finding my go-to farm spot and running in circles for hours. Not kidding. I love herbing/mining/farming rare pets. 
---
the gatekeeping is strong with this one
---
It's been modified a shit ton so who knows.
---
Anyone know of a route this fast and easy to follow for the horde? Preferably a video 
---
I haven't got any friends to go into Classic with either but I'm not really bothered, I naturally made friends pretty fast on the big N. That might just be an advantage of playing a healer though lmao. If nothing else, if you're Horde I'll be your friend 👍
---
Yea I’d imagine he spent the majority of his run firmly ahead of the pack. IIRC dynamic respawn is only in effect when there are X number (usually a good bit) of people in a given area. Xp rates are accurate, they fixed the TBC quest values being used before that launch.. 
---
Agreed
---
I had the good fortune of being corrected a while back. The "Scarab Lord" title was not part of Vanilla. It did not enter the game until 2.0.3
---
This meme sucks worse than retail
---
How do they handle server merging when it comes to duplicate character names? Offer players some incentive to change their name, like in the case of giving up your seat on an overbooked flight?
---
* [Patch 2.0.3](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_2.0.3) (2007-01-09) added.
---
there was scarab lord title until TBC. The mount was the title.
---
I had 50 to 60ms ping on Blizz servers back in Vanilla, something like 30ms in Legion.

&gt;PvP areas
---
We're talking about world PvP.
---
I don't engage in that. People only stoop to that level when they know they're wrong.
---
Which RP server would we choose? :-p
---
I remember in Vanilla, choosing an RP server because we expected the playerbase to be more sensible and less skript kiddie because Blizzard was semi-enforcing RP.
---
Patch changes - 2.0.3 added
---
I looked at the quest chain and came up with 16.2K to get Neutral with Brood of Nozdormu. I could have miscalculated!
---
Haha! I like the way you took this one. Touche. 
---
I’ve subscribed to a pair of streamers in the past, yes, but how are you going to judge another person behind your keyboard based on how they spend their money to support another person that gives them entertainment? I know I’m talking to someone with no hope of having a legit conversation, so I guess I’ll end it here but seriously dude, if you need some help there are phone numbers out there and social services to help people with mental disabilities as well as any types of depression. I know people like you that have hurt themselves before and while you’re obviously in a deeply troubled state, there is a way out. There is help for people like you. Don’t give up! 
---
don't worry, I give back to the community
---
You don't need these people in your life. You're one of us now
---
The new generation is fucked... 
---
Although I spent 20 bucks to make a Russian cam girl do what I wanted her too and I can’t lie, it’s definitely worth more than paying a streamer to say your user name out loud, fake a reaction,
---
“OMG THANK YOUUUU THANK U SO MUCH STUPID 14 YEAR OLD #3 THOUSAND”, and then continue on ignoring you. 
---
Both specs sit in the back in a dress and throw downranked healing spells, so it comes down to what you want to do and what your guild's comp wants to be. I'm pretty sure Paladin has better farming with the 20/31/0 build, but you may need to respec frequently if your guild already has a Sanctuary paladin. If your guild already has a Sanctuary paladin, I'd say priest is the best bet because Paladin respec costs get prohibitive. If you CAN be the Sanctuary paladin, you are in such a good spot for overall level 60 content that it's hardly funny, it's one of the most versatile builds in the game, if not the single most versatile build. I highly suggest trying to be the Sanc paladin for your guild, it comes with so many benefits and very few drawbacks. 
---
Priest has the option to play Shadow in raid, so if you want to be the one shadow player, that might be a reason to play Priest. 
---
&lt;You Didnt Even Cap Farm&gt;
---
&lt;At Least We Took Stables&gt;
---
Both were on my server.
---
leveling as balance and having to work really hard at not dying
---
Skarm had a video called "tanking one fight and healing the next" on YouTube. Used a mix of feral and resto talents.
---
If i look at the playerbase i played vanilla with most of the time then they all will be in their late 20s or early 30s. They either stopped playing all together or just play casual retail and i don't think many will come back for classic. I also don't have much time and I'm 28. But i definitely want to chill out with some leveling and dungeon/pvp. But i don't think I'll have the time for raiding this time around. 
---
I wrote this one a couple weeks ago you might like: [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b2ongg/i\_envy\_those\_rolling\_druid\_for\_the\_first\_time/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b2ongg/i_envy_those_rolling_druid_for_the_first_time/)
---
Did my best to bring the hype, since I agree the "life at 60" druid thread was just god-awful. 
---
I think the guide I saw mentioned Exalted rep, if you ran the numbers I'd trust that more tbh. Most of the guides I've come across seem to have become corrupted with non-vanilla knowledge and have had their accuracy slip.
---
Hamstring kiting is the most efficient way to level, but you'll be okay without it as long as you pull intelligently.
---
Really, without Hamstring method you're just going to take 20-25% more damage, it's not going to be the end of the world. I don't plan to use it when I eventually level a warrior alt.
---
You are being downvoted because that 'solution' doesnt fix the problem. In business you don't aim for a solution that still leaves you with stragglers left behind that you are constantly trying to convince to transfer.... You want to solve the issue of the dead realm, not exacerbate it by transferring even more people off of it. Thats why they only allow transfers TO dead realms, or full on mergers.
---
Like Valgar said, you would end up with some people left behind who wouldnt want to xfer or wouldnt know how, and they are just stranded forever. Thats horrible business man.
---
That’s very true, I remember reading about the dynamic respawns only being in effect with a certain amount of people in the area. The thing is, we have no idea knowing how big that “area” is, nor the number of people exactly. Just gonna have to wait for classic I guess 🤷🏼‍♂️😂
---
I could likely be whatever I want at outset as I’m part of a core of a few guys running the guild. Though you never know where things will lead and I also want to make sure I’m enjoying it. I appreciate the feedback!
---
Archimonde represent
---
Seems like it with all of the downvoted and other comments you’ve received. Sorry you’re ignorant and arrogant. It’s not like there’s video proof it existing in classic versions of the game or anything. 
---
If I start a guild, this is system I’d like to try.
---
We’d probably have to mix it with SK for tier pieces, but I like the idea overall.
---
Do you think it would work if there was a point system added for raiders who got nothing? So you get one point for every raid you get no loot, up to 10 points. 
---
Once you have 10 points, you can spend all of it to “hard reserve” a piece of gear.
---
Eh, if you don't bring it up it won't happen. People enjoyed moonwalking, even without the moonstrafing benefits adds to the feel which they have said is a goal.
---
People will actually miss moonwalking while playing. But I do agree they are in the same realm of wants rather than need. 
---
Now the times when you get stuck while looting and can't loot anything else, I am fine with that being fixed. 
---
I just started leveling an alliance toon for the first time ever so this could come in handy :) Thanks 
---
Interesting, I didn't know Heroic Leap was there since the beginning, I thought it was added for the first time during WotLK Beta (and scrapped again until Cata).
---
Im not tho, an equal geared equal buffed equal consumed frost mage, good player vs bad player will have a difference in dps. The only explanation if skill
---
6-8 Servers: NA PvP, NA PvE, NA RP, EU PvP, EU PvE, EU RP (2 more if RPvP happens).
---
I disagree that community isn't fostered in larger servers.  One of the biggest issues in small servers was that you were forced to work with people you hated, because there was no-one else.  You can't ignore the rogue in spirit gear because otherwise you can't fill your raid etc.
---
Many of Blizzard's design decisions were not well grounded, or complete guesses... like the number of people playing at launch.  
---
They're going to have to allow massive caps at launch in order to not have the player base spread thinly 3 months onwards.  Better a short burst of overcrowded 10k servers, than a dozen 500 player servers 3 months later.
---
&gt; paid server transfers. be happy on a low or medium pop realm. re-roll on another server.
---
Is the playerbase really going to be happy paying blizzard $$ to transfer to another server because they lost the realm lottery and now have to move? Or lose their character and 2 months of leveling to reroll? And 50% of people dont even want cross realm BG's....
---
I feel like this is a disaster waiting to happen. You nonchalantly say they should just charge money for xfers, when we all know this community would go CRAZY if they had to pay for something thats not really their fault.
---
PvP areas that were in the world.
---
WPvP happened a lot in Ogri’la/Netherwing and any other daily hub.
---
Glad to see someone got lucky.  I've been in 5 guilds (maybe 6?) since Wrath, even one that I was invited to by irl friends during MoP.  Not one of them had anyone talk more than the occasional request for a group to dungeon.
---
Even the guilds with a raid group had no chat.  Mumble/discord/teamspeak were all silent unless there was raid planning.  And even when there was talking it was all business.  It's like people forgot to be friends.
---
Not bannable.
---
With the ramping up of information releases recently... I feel like an announcement is close.
---
It's like 90% the same as a general PvP server. Every now and again you see a group sitting in a corner or marching around.
---
It's not. You been told 5x now
---
If anyone wants to see some SERIOUS amount of salt, read the rest of the comments in this thread.
---
I agree I hope TSM takes a bit to update for classic because that add on is almost OP in terms of controlling the AH. 
---
same here, only minus shower and gym. i also fullquit my job
---
Do you have to always stay In character / rp mode?
---
...and no where else. Which is the point.
---
That was just the start too. Flying mounts continued to ruin world PvP for expansions to come. 
---
I’ve seen some really dumb shit where humans are bottom prio and can’t roll on weapons with a 10-20dps upgrade just because it’s not a sword. 
---
I recognise that the the following is just whining:
---
With loot as desirable and scarce as it is in vanilla, I don’t think I’ll be the only one who experiences a bad side of these loot shenanigans in Classic. They are completely different from those that existed in vanilla, but they’re a nuisance all the same.
---
It’s not going to ruin the experience, but I’m going to go prot tank instead of fury for classic in part to avoid these human fury warrior memes, I can just collect my tier gear and a nice tanking weapon, with minimal competition, and chill.
---
If I was so late to bc that I only experienced the last few weeks of it... am i a wrath baby ? 
---
WoW Classic and Pantheon will shape the MMO industry if they're both successful.
---
I think leveling kind of died after cata's launch. Before that it felt like they built a world and dropped in quests that made sense for that world.  Instead now it's s story-driven quest chain with a pretty background built around it.
---
It might make for a better first experience, but the replay value went down the drain.
---
You will be shocked to find there are players like me and the OP. 
---
I started very late BC and didn’t get to experience raids until wrath. I still find original wow more fun, I have a level 45 shammy on a classic p server that I enjoy more than I ever have retail. World PvP in the older game is wildest as fuck
---
Remember that time when you told me I'm triggered and then a couple replies later you were super triggered and wrote a paragraph to me because I made judgments about you?  
---
Yeah, fun times.  
---
AFAIK not many people know about his route but the mods did confirm he did it legit so take that as you will.
---
Dude if you can even reach that bridge with the 2 molten giants in front of it you're seriously OP ;-)
---
Pretty much this.  
---
well thanks man I HAD NOOOO IDEA :) 
---
I play feral on pserver and i love it. I'm basically able to tank/dps and heal in raid and can switch on the fly depending of what the raid need.
---
There are also gear pieces that literally only druids can use as well.
---
24 and feel this post got 3 even younger friends into it
---
I’m aching for a release date so I can apply for summer leave immediately! Vanilla will only re-release once...
---
The demographics will be younger kids who were born out of their time and are disgusted with the absolutely shitty state of the video game industry right now and people who played Vanilla when it was retail and haven't found another game to scratch that same itch.
---
So it'll be more of the same demographics, but with an overall better developed knowledge on how to play the game.
---
I will crush you!
---
Which will also be the server with the highest pop. Same as always.
---
I raided as SPriest and there is really not much to the rotation. Just a joke my friend. Congratz on the 4th place in the DPS chart.
---
what core is this even
---
Well they did it once, PlayerName - ServerName but I really didnt like that system. Free transfers might be a better solution? This is an issue I havent heard a good fix for yet.
---
Sorry for that.
---
Yeah, if you can take your pick, I'd go Paladin and play 20/31/0, you won't be disappointed, it's absolutely fantastic. You still get the crit refund on your healing. You're missing a bit of healing crit, but you provide other utility to make up for it, and you've still taken everything that makes H Pal great. 
---
Here's a quick mockup build for a PvE focus. https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/AzzUwAT_UwHpAA 
---
Take improved Devo aura if you want to be in the Tank group in raid, otherwise those 5 points are flexible and go wherever you want in the prot tree. 
---
&gt; there is a fiscal reason. Those sweet sweet casual bucks.
---
I can’t tell if you’re trolling or not. You know sharding isn’t going to make the game appealing to the casual players right? Easy loot, leveling, LFG and LFR tools will. That aside Classic isn’t really targeted at casual players and if for some insane reason they do try and make Classic appealing to the casual crowd they’ll lose way more than members of the classic community they’ll gain in casual players making those “sweet sweet casual bucks” a net loss.
---
&gt; And you say it's too low level, but enough pressure to appeal to 
---
the casuals could force them into doing it. 
---
A more hands on exec, unsatisfied with Classic, could easily tell 
---
them to implement specific systems they've already done before to appeal to casuals on retail.
---
Again, that’s not an executive’s Job or what they’d do. (And it’s an idiotic solution to that problem in the first place). 
---
&gt; There's no way Classic is a passion project. Do I believe that the current dev team is passionate about it? Yes, but it was in no way conceived as a passion project after the whole "you think you do, but you don't" debacle. They're doing it to get subs back after years of decline in population.
---
I’d love to know how you know this
---
Warrior shaman is more fun- you have a ton more offensive potential.  
---
Paladin / warrior is fine too but really, on the journey from 1-60, you will have more fun with a sham/warr than a pal/warr.  WF totem is just so damn good and synergizes perfectly.   And the shaman's DPS is much better with an elite 2h weap + windfury.  Ret paladin with elite 2h is nothing to sneeze at of course, but you will be killing mobs stupidly fast with warrior/shaman and you gain the ability to kite (frost shock) to help a lot in WPVP.   
---
The only thing you'll REALLY miss not having a paladin is the bubbles.  Ankh is a similar ability to save you a corpse run once in awhile but bubbles can consistently be used in tricky ways or straightforward ways to do things you otherwise wouldn't be able to do. 
---
Plus you won't be competing over gear =P
---
Ok even when you completely substract the material, recpiee and skill learning costs you break even after a very, very long time.
---
That is not even considering the opportunity cost of having a bank alt with alchemy vs a main with 3-4k gold or more, who could be flipping materials on the AH for months.
---
Not triggered just legit worried. I have friends that have committed suicide and even though I don’t know you, I see the same signs in you as I saw in them. Take it however you like. 
---
Aren’t they BOP? 
---
It's not true to the extent you believe it will, I felt that everything was exciting again when playing "somewhere that remains unmentioned" recently. The feeling is more based on your character, the time and effort invested; And in classic almost everything demands some kind of notable effort.
---
And all the 4chan try hards etc will be going PvP. You cant really dodge assholes. They are everywhere. You would have to be watching the internet to manage to get the "right" server choice.
---
Who do you think they are? What do you think they are actually doing and in what kind of guilds? They are just a loud minority.
---
I can't really make much of this kind of feedback. I would appreciate it if you elaborated so I can take into account your thoughts rather than a baseless and vague statement. Thanks for the reply!
---
Can't say I ever listened to the music soundtrack, I may have to, but Teldrassil is amazing.
---
That shit show is what made it though. You right though.. to each his own.
---
They need to add cliff walking back in, I know it was nerfed pre-1.12, but my god that shit was so much fun
---
The reality of the matter is that there is absolutely nothing you can do about it. Other than finding a crystal ball it is impossible to know what servers are gonna die. All we can do is hope blizzard realizes the majority of servers will die and that they plan for that accordingly.
---
running it 114 times doesnt give you a 90% chance for it to drop, it stays 2%
---
guzzling chum
---
Alright I'm done here.
---
&gt; Not triggered
---
Ehhhhhhh I dunno about that pal hahah.  
---
Can someone please explain what spell batching is in simple terms? Thank you
---
They were trash in vanilla as well
---
It's the opposite actually. It's harder to kite the modern AI than it is to kite the older AI (especially in regards to weaving in melee to apply a slow and then moving out of range), which affects how useful hamstring kiting is.
---
Paladin is a much better pocket healer, for bubble and BoF
---
That fucking cave that you do in Valley of Trials at level 4-5 is awful.
---
As someone who wasn’t able to play classic at the time it released and having to start in legion, I’m excited to play classic 
---
Yikes you certainly blew up fast.
---
It's actually done pretty well on netherwing, but that's tbc not vanilla. It took them a while to get it corrected in their beta, but it feels great.
---
Honestly an amazing post. Great job. Take some karma from me :) well deserved 
---
This is great! Are you in the [WoW Speedleveling Discord](https://discord.gg/w8ttZZF)? If not, you need to be. Would love to see more Classic leveling content for when it comes out.
---
&gt; BG's were just fine in regular non arena pvp gear you could still get 400+ resilience, i know as i had full sets of normal BG gear with no arena pieces and i was able to be competitive
---
yet others, who played arenas, were still capable of getting better gear.
---
I use a chrome extension called Hover Zoom that lets me see images in links without having to click them.  
---
Needless to say I was pretty confused when I hovered over the image on this post lol.  
---
Do I click?
---
I played on TVC too but not in vanilla, i started in TBC. I remember that the ye old goon squade was so hated on the horde side because everyone said they were a gank guild. the day i moved away from that server my enjoyment of the game increased a lot.
---
This is really helpful.
---
I wonder how I’d like being a hybrid type. My interest in WoW has always revolves around min-maxing and competing on DPS meters, so healing will already be a change up.
---
Classic didn't have a bunch of Wpvp in every zone either.
---
It was only prominent in Un'goro, Hillsbrad, STV, Tanaris, BS/Blackrock Mountain, and maybe the Plaguelands.
---
90% of which was one-sided ganks.
---
&gt; You're a self absorbed, smug, reddit jackass, who cant take the time of day to properly read a post and instead of correcting something in a friendly manner, you take the "You're an idiot" approach.
---
This projection, LOL
---
&gt;That being said doing the fastest /played is different from getting server first.
---
That's also a good point, this record he just set apparently was over a decent amount of time(he had measures to prevent rested), meaning he could play optimally through-out the whole thing.
---
Hey Blizzard,
---
Do NOT give us the release date!
---
Just make WoW Classic appear in [B.Net](https://B.Net) one day and watch ppl scramble!
---
That would be some nice trolling ;)
---
If it's completely voluntary to remain on the dead server I don't see a problem with it. It's a lot better than making massive changes to the game by altering a core design philosophy.
---
You also are limited by mob respawn times and the time it takes to travel to more spawns because you're clearing faster. If you just had infinite mobs to run through without those 2 things as a problem then you could level with however many people you want but that's not the case.  
---
Regardless slowing down your leveling speed so you can enjoy it is more then worth it to a lot of people who play the game.
---
Hey! Don’t forget us poor OCE players, we need servers too :)
---
Rookie numbers! 
---
1 week off? Pfft
---
The gym? Pfft 
---
Shower?!! HA
---
This is going to be my alt! Never played a druid before, only clothie and war, so I'm excited for hots and wpvp
---
Not yet, never heard of it before. This has just been a solo venture so far. I couldn't find an alliance guide I liked so decided to roll my own! I joined the disc though thanks for the link.
---
I remember one Warsong for alittle while I was selling trips to the IF airfield. I remember losing my shit as a 13-14 year old losing my shit when a GM messaged me about it.
---
Trust me, there's plenty. The number of people in the druid discord is 3-6 times more than most of the other discords. 
---
Nice! I love that mountain in the north barrens that’s all cloudy or smokey. Can’t remember, just tall and  awesome 
---
Jesus you just made me hate my future main's race. Thanks a lot for ruining my plan, asshole.
---
&gt; am i going to have a really bad time as a warrior if i don't hamstring kite
---
Well let's think about this.  You can be hit once by a mob with a 1.25s swing timer for every one of your 3.6 second swings or...you can be hit three times for every one of your swings.
---
You have to use your brain.  If you're +5 levels and can rape your way through some mobs without trying then no you don't have to HS kite.  If you're leveling with a healer you don't need to hamstring kite.  If you're solo and the mob's throwing up sunders or a stacking poison debuff on you, yeah you should be hamstring kiting.  
---
And another thing I see some bad/clueless warriors doing while hamstring kiting.  Some mobs (cats) have an extremely fast swing timer that will hit you at least twice if you practice running through the mobs.  To avoid this, make and arch or triangle around them where your swing is at max distance of their hit box.
---
twice\* in a life time opportunity.
---
How could it possibly be a passion project from the company that told us to our faces that "you think you want Classic, but you don't". That's the exact opposite of a passion project. That's a company going "you'll have to twist our arms to get this cause we really don't want to give it to you".
---
As for the others, it is true that sharding alone isnt enough, but it's a step in that direction. And if it was true that hardcore would bring more money than casual, Retail wouldn't be in the spot it is now. Do I think sharding alone would be all they do? No, I think if they were going to go that route they would do a lot more than just that. But the other QoL changes that they would implement aren't there from the start in the way Sharding will be. Making Sharding the first, and the start.
---
Warrior plus shaman combination is a trap for leveling and PvP. Shaman does not nearly enable you as much as paladin does with blessing of freedom and dispels.
---
&gt; We haven’t yet determined exactly when phases 2-6 will occur
---
The term "exactly" is a clear indication that they're referring to exact date/time, not interval. And the term "phases 2-6" is a clear indication that they're not talking about phase 1.
---
Which would suggest that it's different for phase 1.........
---
There are many Tauren tanks. Make no mistake there 
---
What even is this?
---
Hi, /u/OldSchoolHardcoreG
---
New friends to be made in classic. It's the same for me the only person that shows genuine interest is my wife so we're going to make a guild and try to foster a community.
---
Panel 6 and 7 would’ve been enough.
---
&gt; without Hamstring method you're just going to take 20-25% more damage
---
It's literally 100-200% more damage based on the mob.  
---
None of this makes sense. 
---
I just shared my spreadsheet on reddit after reading this comment, feel free to look up my post!:)
---
Bind on equip, or more like bind when first used.
---
If someone wants to spend all their time and money on alts and twinks and mounts, that's their choice.  Similarly, if someone shows up to all the raids and never gets any gear, that's their choice to pocket that money and not get any shiny new purps.  The only time it becomes an issue is progression, and even then, you're equalizing the costs of consumables across the raid.  That flask you popped pays for itself, or at least comes cheaper.  
---
LARGELY disagree with that! There was tons of world PvP all over the place.
---
I don't know if our server experiences match much...
---
Soloing specific content. I played a Troll Rogue in 2005 and I remember farming Maraudon to kill Mesh’lok the rare swamp creature for the leather chest Fungal Shroud, I think.
---
Soloing BRD Bose for Barmans Shanker.
---
I’ll be a hunter this time around but I think using all available tools and figuring out how to solo stuff is awesome.
---
You should try and bring this up with the ClassiCast team.   
---
I've been trying to get StaySafe to talk about this on his stream and while we did discuss it quite a bit, he can't notice any difference thus asks for a good comparison video, but im not able to find any good demo AoE videos since that would be the best way to do so.  
---
If you guys could band together and get a video / topic  going, this would be ideal as you reach more people.  
---
I've also noticed that the demo numbers aren't exactly the same as in retail WoW, so they did actually change something but it's not quite there yet.
---
MAYBE this would make sense in a higher quality resolution but as it stands. 
---
I’m a lil brain damaged 
---
I'm asking what's preventing you from saying the name

Basically the servers only process information in a certain amount of time. The time to gather information is the serving "batching time" then after that the things actions are executed that happened during that time.
---
Lets say we are both warriors. You charge me right when you get in range and I charge you right when I get in range. Both of us charge during the batching time, then both are executed by the server simultaneously. Resulting in us traveling to each others location and being stunned by each other.
---
So both of our actions were process at the same time, some both had 100% effectiveness. 
---
I was looking at wowwiki. It was 16.2K to get Neutral which then opens up the scepter quest chains.
---
putting time into a single character  again
---
I’m unlikely to play Human again because I’m so bored from it back when I first started.  However, Elwynn is still my favorite starting zone.
---
3 days 9 hours isn't nearly enough time to sit down and enjoy some RP in every Inn...
---
Haha. Hey man some people like the aesthetic, /shrug. It's like some people like feet (weird af to me), but fuck it, you like what you like you know?
---
I don't think there is an incentive.  I believe they port one server on to the other and the incoming character has to change their name.
---
DPS'ers go Orc usually, but tanks go Tauren. 
---
Solution: go troll.
---
For pvp paladin is way way better, for dungeons and raids having a sick shaman behind you is amazing.
---
I would honestly let the healer pick what he prefers. Paladin is very defensive and utility. Shaman is a mix between offense and support. 
---
Yes, every server will have assholes.  Servers with a large streamer following will have more.  
---
Rule 4 states no sharing of private servers.Check your DM’s though.
---
Well, wow races aren't fetishes. Or at least for MOST people
---
If I sensed I had a group that was new-ish to the game. I loved tanking dungeon tours for them.
---
Running every. Last boss. In BRD (about 4.5 hours)
---
Or doing Orange to Purple to Princess in Maraudon. Minds are blown when they realize everything’s connected.
---
1) EP/GP was not that big of a leap.  This is more like "I still drive my 2014 Impala even though there's a 2019 Impala"
---
2) Even when cars were first invented, horses were still very common
---
3) Most people today have transitioned to cars.  That is not my experience with EP/GP.  
---
people used spell batching to counter other people's spells. Someone shoots a vipersting at the same time as your vanish, well the vanish technically didn't happen first but since spells are "resolved" at the same time you were not hit.
---
Something like that, it is the reason 2 mages will cast polymorph and sometimes they both turn into sheep.
---
&gt; Its important to note that this new run was on a private server with dynamice spawn rates and stuff, so take it with a grain of salt.  
---
People making claims based on assumptions really fucking grinds my gears. You might wanna check what server he played on and update your post.  
---
Otherwise, gj.
---
Dude I'm right with you. When I hit 60 (or 70, as I did on a recent "place") I get incredibly bored. I don't want to raid; I don't want to gear-grind 0.X sets. I don't want to grind rep just for the hell of it.
---
I end up getting bored and rolling an alt. An alt far away from the previous one, and level him in completely different zones. 
---
And most importantly (this took some serious discipline): I turn **OFF** questie/quest helper. I'm sorry but this isn't a race, and those addons ruin it. They make the game skyrim, and take away the magic. I know in classic a lot of people will be old guard returning, and won't really know those addons exist. This makes me happy because I know I can find people to jump in with and *explore*.
---
Clearly not because I remember there being more than enough WPvP I’m TBC, especially at meeting stones for heroics and raiding.
---
Psychology at work here. It hurts people more when we don’t meet expectations than it does to not know when something is going to happening. 
---
Plus hope is like a high. Just ride the anticipation train of checking the internets every day to see the next wow classic announcement. 
---
BFA?
---
Dungeon Finder was in WotLK.
---
hey it's me your neighbor
---
I won't say if you're right or wrong, but I will say that after Classic vanilla and Classic TBC (if), I will be done with MMOs barring any super *amazing* releases.  
---
I've never seen another MMO besides WoW that I wanted to play.  
---
After this I'll be playing single player RPGs and sim games.  
---
As someone who didn't get to 60 till a few months pre tbc I will be ecstatic getting and seeing geared people again. Seeing people in full tier sets will spark the nostalgia hard again 
---
The problem I have with that is that Classic really is once in a lifetime. If they botch the launch and people quit and forget about it, it's over. 
---
Um no. You are trying to read way too far into it. The term "exactly" can certainly be an interval. 
---
"We have decided to release phase 2 *exactly* six months after the release of phase 1" is an example of this. They simply do not know when they are releasing each phase.
---
THIS. I am that player lol
---
And the resist... so true hahaha
---
Don't let your dreams be dreams, just make that male nightelf.
---
It's just dumb not to when you're not in a tight area. So much more efficient.
---
Going druid 100% in classic. Never played one in vanilla :-) 
---
&gt;Varrak is a god
---
Varrak also played his speedrun on a server with incorrect quest XP using older Mangos values.
---
- Varrak turning in Wastewander Justice: 5,000xp
---
- Wastewander Justice official: 3,600
---
Quests 30-60 grant something like 40% more xp. Normalized, I doubt his time would be much of an improvement over Joana's original time (and Joana just did a new 3 day 22 hour using legit OG XP values)
---
People just forgot what niche gaming is. Some games simply were not made to please everyone. They were made with a vision and passion, and who was drawn to them, belonged in them.
---
People will learn to adapt to Classic Wow, because it demands it. If a player thinks the game adapts to them like modern, rotating door, cash shop games ... they can go off an play those games and leave Classic to the rest of us. It's a lesson that needs to be learned again or else we'll continue to see watered down, mass appeal games created for the single reason of collecting the most money from the most people.
---
I agree that classic has more grinding than is really fun even for the older wow vets, but it's important because of the effect it has. If you could just pay to have a free 60 it strips some of the meaning out of it. Things moving too fast is what ruins a lot of MMOS, leveling teaches you your class and sometimes forces you into fun moments.
---
So I'm pretty sure Varrak's run is actually the speed run that caused people to figure out that the exp values after level 40 or so were the wrong values.  
---
I'd like to see if this guide remains accurate after level 40.  
---
Definitely a valid point. We need as large of a foothold as we can get with regards to playerbase for this to be a viable product for Blizzard to continue developing for. I'd definitely rather wait then this be the last shot we get.... We need at least TBC Classic too haha..
---
Viability depends entirely on what your guild will accept. Plenty of guilds will be delighted if you just show up regularly for raids. They won't care what spec you are. If on the other hand you want to be in a hardcore progression guild, then most off-specs won't be viable. 
---
Exceptions are Feral Druid tanks, which some guilds will accept as off-tanks, Shadow Priests for buffing Warlocks, and of course Fury Warriors are optimal for dps (and possibly tanking at later stages of progression).
---
There will be a working version of abar before you can learn hamstring at level 8.

Seal Cub Clubbers Club.
---
Been playing the OST on Spotify for 2 days straight. Bad times at work...
---
The majority of the data is from retail classic wow back in 2006. Just this one column on the very right is from a p-server run. I thought I could include the new data with a warning in the post.
---
I find it hard to believe that you read the big post from days ago without understanding it.  The most upvoted comments in it are both explaining what it is AND why they like it.
---
Did they say why?
---
&gt; Games go micro-transaction when they don't have the population for a traditional subscription model.
---
This guy gets it. 
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Most games nowadays are like falling stars, they glow a lot, but they don't last long. They generate a large amount of money over a short period and they go down fast. Games that last longer are 
---
Well, that's gay. At least I don't have to worry about playing at launch, then.
---
&gt; mobtagging is different in private servers
---
[citation needed]
---
Definitely a hard sell. 
---
Being wrong is fine, defending it to the death like you have on this post however... certainly warrants all the downvotes you’ve gotten, again something you were apparently baffled by and must be because of all these stupid lib snowflakes right?
---
The original post was someone asking how to hamstring kite, not the efficacy of it, and you brought nothing to the table including a bunch of misinformation which you got correctly, and nicely, called out on. You then proceed to go all caps bitch fest about “why am I getting downvoted” and “must be snowflakes”; doesn’t take a genius to realize it probably had something to do with you being wrong about information on a “how to” post.  Additionally, even if my TTK is 2 sec slower HS kiting, you’ll have to eat food every 4-5 mobs, while I won’t, once again proving the tried and true method of HS kiting mobs. Who cares about TTK efficiency if your downtime makes you do everything I do at a much slower rate?
---
You brought up swing timer addons but don’t seem to understand how they work despite your massive, non snowflake IQ so allow me. If you swing every 4s you can weave your non GCD attacks in between, giving a very similar TTK to regular fighting minus the minute rage you pick up from getting hit; which gets HEAVILY outweighed by the amount of HP you lose man fighting.  But we both know I’m wasting time responding to you, you’re clearly a seasoned professional that would never be open to mechanics speed runners use right?
---
Lastly, for lauding your extensive video game library and massive IQ over us Reddit plebs, you sure write a lot to get a pretty simple, albeit proven incorrect, argument across. Quit moving the goal posts to “you shouldn’t play warriors then” or “it’s not fitting with class fantasy” and keep to the point; which was why you got heavily downvoted for failing to add anything to the question of how hamstring kiting works! Stay safe in that bubble my dude, don’t let the snowflakes get you, and remember always double down in the face of facts!!!
---
I am not maining druid again. If you want to dps and pvp it’s just too frustrating.
---
Yeah, a well geared feral can be a serious opponent in wpvp; but any well geared class can do that. And the meat of pvp will still be in BGs where your survivability won’t mean squat when you take 2 minutes to kill a guy and his buddies spawn in 10 seconds.
---
I might level an alt though, once AQ is out and is more common. It is a fun class, but also very annoying at times.
---
Lol. Yup, this is pretty vile.
---
Underrated comment.
---
How much does ganking slow down speed levels? Ideally to be done on pve realms?
---
Every step of this guide is personally tested. As I mentioned before this guide will be updated when classic launches for just those kind of issues you mention. What's your evidence that Joana is using legit OG XP values?
---
Well clearly I dont remember. If you think I'm trying to get a front page post or something I'm not you could downvote the post idc. 
---
As someone that played a pally in a warrior pally combo. Then 13 years later played a warrior with a shaman both sets of toons 100% leveled together. Choose the shaman/warrior combo for two reasons. Less gear overlap your not both aiming for the same gear during leveling aside from weapons sometimes. Also with a shaman you will offer more utility to the warrior with WF totem than blessing of might ever will. The only small con is shamans are squishier than paladins in wpvp. If my shaman buddy was jumped he might die but I’d usually kill the offender. Paladin is just a really easy class to play but unfortunately that also makes it boring. 
---
I mean if we're talking about speed with actual fast levelers the concern for # of mobs available is less pertinent because it's typically in a fresh scenario being ahead of the pack.
---
But without those assumptions yea.
---
Ohh okay. Thank ya.

Elwynn gives the most nostalgia feels because it’s the very first place I explored in my wow journey. Durotar has the best memories because it’s the first place I met my rl friend in game on his lvl 60 warr and I was in awe of his epic undead horse. 
---
I voted for tirisfal because UD is my favorite race to play and I love the feel of the zone.
---
I guess it makes sense. My vanilla char was a nelf, but I ran to Ironforge after Teldrassil, that journey climaxing in running up the snowy hill and seeing Ironforge for the first time is definitely one of the fonder memories I have from the game.   
---
I suppose it's the same when you discover Stormwind for the first time, though I must say I'm glad my first journey was 'the long one'.
---
I've spent about 6 months watching every step of the video and personally testing the steps myself on current voldemort servers. That's really the best anyone can do right now.  As I mentioned before this guide will be updated when classic launches. Definitely interested to see how everything turns out!
---
Imo:
---
Balance: 1.5-2 - I've seen a couple in raiding enviroment, but we had to kick them for progression. 
---
Feral(dps): 3 if you are very good, most likely 2.
---
Ret: 1.5? I've seen some guilds use it and it does do some dps just not nearly enough and it provides no unique utility. 
---
Shadow: 2.5, it's very useful for most guilds but an absolutely tryhard guild will not use one.
---
Elemental: 1 - Unfortunately curse of elementals/shadows doesn't work with nature which really makes elemental super bad, without even considering mana issues.
---
Enhancement: 1.5  some use it in raids with nightfall but honestly they have some of the worst nightfall uptime and totemtwisting as enhancement doesn't add much (and you can spec enh/resto for twisting).
---
Arms: 1, honestly mortal strike debuff just to have a arms warrior isn't worth it. You can do it in 20mans though it should be fine as people don't usually have optimal debuffs and the cleave dps is good.
---
Fury ? 5 it's the best dps spec in the game.
---
unfortunately for you my neighbors are as annoying as hell
---
On established servers expect large differences. On a fresh server it depends if you are ahead of the curve or not.
---
&gt; Without it, both groups would be killing the civilians without consequence.
---
Right, but the effect is negligible.  The amount of people on any server who are serious rankers is very small and all it takes is one guy to camp a quest giver.  There's really no difference in the amount of time that quest givers are dead, there's just a small group of people who don't participate.
---
Blizzard's intention was probably to reduce the amount of time that quest givers are killed, not to reduce the pool of people who are killing quest givers by an extremely small negligible amount, right?  So that would make this system a failure, since it doesn't really do what they wanted it to do.
---
&gt; No, that wouldn't fit with the lore. What does fit with the lore is your military leaders frowning on you killing civilians.
---
Who cares about the lore?  None of this fits in with the lore.  A magical rank system where you automatically get points from killing enemy soldiers and these points are magically kept track of even if you kill someone in the middle of nowhere with no witnesses doesn't make any lore sense.
---
You know what *really* doesn't make lore sense?  Being able to kill important quest NPCs over and over again.  Is farmer Saldean in Westfall some kind of immortal god or something?  Why does he keep coming back from the dead if he gets killed over and over again?
---
It's a video game, the systems of the game don't have to fit in with the lore.  And regardless, unkillable quest NPCs arguably fit into the lore better than zombie NPCs that can be killed a million times and always respawn after a set amount of time.  What's the lore explanation for that?
---
Mah Naga.
---
&gt;  What's your evidence that Joana recent testing is using legit OG XP values?
---
Joana's stream where he said he was using a private server with the updated XP values. Most updated their databases once Varrak's run showed they had wrong info.
---
Nice, I expect people ahead of the curve not to murder each other because it slows them both down.
---
Basically it’s for pvp’ers and will make it feel more vanilla. We usually only get updates and changes for pve, and the last pvp update was 1.12AV which wasn’t really loved or hated. Spell batching will let high end pvpers do some crazy plays.
---
Without getting to technical, the game processes actions at a slower rate....so you can dodge attacks and do some fun counter abilities. Your computer inputs don’t get sent to the server instantly, so people can quickly hit abilities to counter yours and the server resolved them at the same time. 
---
Also it will greatly reduce server lag with multiple people because less data packets are being sent to the server. If it sends 100packets of data every 10 seconds to the server in retail, spell batching will only send 10 packets every 10 seconds...so less lag with more people!
---
For more in-depth explaining the input packets and how they are resolved together just google :)
---
People are trying to get way too cute with leveling a warrior.  Just go arms the entire way and respec one time, after you've farmed your pre-bis.  Keeping your weapon relevant is the most important aspect of leveling a warrior, the best way to do so is running dungeons, the easiest way for you as a warrior to run dungeons is as a tank.  You're going to want tactical mastery and anger management asap, then sweeping strikes which is when the entire kit takes off.
---
TBC added new PvP stuff, flying was cool and most people enjoyed it at the time as zones were designed around it partially, semi-new profession stuff, overall just a lot of fun new things. 
---
Wrath added more new stuff like Winterspring being an entire new PvP zone, more arthas lore for Warcraft nerds seeking closure, more mechanics like the Oculus which was cool until you had to run it the 10th+ time, PvP was more balanced and probably at it's pinnacle during wrath.
---
WoW hadn't really started to go downhill until halfway through wotlk when they added group finder and LFR which ruined the community aspect. The homogenization got significantly worse too.
---
Today sure everyone says flying bad, etc, but at the time it was revolutionary and awesome.
---
&gt; How could it possibly be a passion project from the company that told us to our faces that "you think you want Classic, but you don't".
---
There were always people inside Blizzard who wanted to make Classic.
---
&gt; And if it was true that hardcore would bring more money than casual
---
Hardcore is a smaller market than casual, retail is for casual, classic is for the more hardcore/old school audience they didn't have. Two who groups don't really cross over very much. Making Retail more hardcore would have the same affect with the casual community.
---
Nice nipple can we talk?
---
This is cute af, and I hope people meme this for all eternity in the best of ways.
---
Current wow doesn’t have accomplishment it just has Ilvl the ever moving measuring stick that doesn’t tell a complete story about a character. However in classic someone with thunderfuy stands out as a bad ass. I’ve never envied someone with a dramatic Ilvl difference the way I have envied some of those MTs from vanilla. 
---
I've subbed to streamers, and donated to youtubers. Mostly to pay for their service to keep the entertainment going, or to support a political or philosophical channel on YT. Doesn't mean every donor is trying to get noticed.
---
&gt; Better off just doing another heroic strike, even with imp rend due to the limited rage you generate early on. 
---
Found a bad warrior. So you don't want to use rend because of limited rage but you do want to heroic strike which is the least efficient warrior ability.
---
There are plenty of others, he doesnt even hold the current record. There are hunters that on private servers have leveled fasted than this. Will be interesting to see who gets world first.
---
That's how I looked when I bought the game, except I was 20 years old.
---
That's where I'm testing as well then, I hope as a community we can get even better!
---
You are right. We do have lots of mindless grinding to do. The thing about vanilla is that you will be doing mindless grinding with friends. You wont be able to pull 5 at once. You will have to manage mana and health. It's so much more then that. The grind has a soul. Retail is an empty clone of something that was once great.
---
Speedrunned on like 3 fresh vanilla servers in 2005-2006 and can confirm. If you are fast, the people you meet of the other faction are also fast and dont want to mess around usually. It's a bit different when there already is pvp ranking implemented, but i doubt this will be the case on classic wow.
---
Looking forward to seeing you there also, brother!
---
Sigh. I played a druid for 600+ days played during Vanilla. I want the nostalgia of the druid but I also want to slay everyone in PvP lol. D: (I'd rather heal on my druid then play feral because its only okay in 1.12, mangle made it so much better going into TBC)
---
Even if it is like you say. It's still somehow more fun and rewarding then retail. I dont know why exactly, but the game just works.
---
I was under the impression that you were against the implementation of RP-PVP servers. What's the point of all this? I'm just that you shouldn't have to choose between RP and the active conflict of a PVP server. Yes, if it's not I will have to 'pick my poison', but I'm just trying to make the case for those of us who don't want to have to choose one or the other. 
---
I'm not going to diss someone for wanting to spend an extra 120+ hours on an alt to be silly and have a carbon copy of another character if that's what they wanna do.
---
but even if I can only farm 15-20g an hour that's still ridiculous amount of gold and respecs before gear farming time is included lol so my brain just can't imagine it, unless they choose a different race for racials that's one thing I guess.

This is fantastic information to me. Thank you
---
I'll be shitting in a cup and sleeping in situ. None of this nonsense you're thinking of doing.
---
My favorites page is getting so huge with all these useful classic resources. Good work!
---
If you are horde and going alchemy/tailoring, I'd make a really strong case for druid.  The moonwell is a little inconvenient to get to as a non druid horde side, so having a free teleport to moonglade seems like a very efficient way of getting your mooncloth craft done.  
---
Redo itemization. Current system devalues gear in the past you needed to do content to get gear to do more content. Current system get behind wait till the next raid tier or season and you can see all the content. And while some people may enjoy current wow it feels empty and pointless to me. Yes it’s mechanically harder but that’s not what drew me to wow. It was the social aspect and team work that rewarded effort equally. 
---
Oh, found another bad warrior.
---
Go level to 21 on tightsrope with your meme fury spec, I'll show you how wrong you are.
---
A Druid life is a complicated one if you want to play more roles than just heal.
---
If healing and being a priest is your thing, it may be wise to research efficient leveling so you get to 60 easier as priest. 
---
Druids level far more easily if feral. You can tank, dps or even heal dungeons if you carry a heal set (even 60 dungeons due to how Hotw works). Druid heals can actually top meters if done right in raids but then you're faced with changing specs often if you want to use on of the MANY other popular Druid specs for pvp, grinding, etc.
---
To me, it's the end game consideration. Druid means a lot of spec changing, many different gear set and learning to play a very complex class. This is frustrating to many and priest is just the better support option overall.
---
If you know how to gear a feral though, they are in the top 3 for speed leveling.
---
It is though because a single player can get 1k xp through 10 mobs and then the first be re-spawning by the time they've killed the last mob at solo pace. Two players will get slightly more then half of that xp each but since they're killing at twice the rate the first mob won't be respawning so they will have to travel to another location to find more mobs.  
---
This gets even worse when you factor in rare drop quests and item on the ground quests that have respawn times. Leveling solo is almost always faster, but speed doesn't equate to fun for a lot of people.
---
If you want some data for 2-15, I have some 'rough estimates' for his XPH (just by checking Youtube player times for XP needed / time per level.

they're rounded to a near minute and not to the second, so it's a bit fudged, but close.

Yes, for each individual run.
---
If you run 114 times, the chance that you see at least one drop is 90%. You'll see an average of about 2 of course.
---
And yes, if you've run 113 times without seeing it drop, the 114th try will have a 2% chance. But if you go another 114 times, the chance to see at least one drop is about 90%.
---
I'm in exactly the same boat as you, made a few trails as a kid in late tbc.. still consider myself a wrath baby though

---
Assuming that is true, that information was nowhere in this thread that I could see up until now.
---
But once again we are playing the game where pirate server players pretend their servers are 100% Blizzlike until proven otherwise, and the burden of proof is on anyone but them.
---
Yet, they made a clear indication "phases 2-6"? So, they know *when* are they releasing phase 1? Would it make sense to "release phase 1 0 days after release"?
---
Those were fixed about a year ago on all top / popular servers.
---
Yep. I plan on avoiding the sub-Reddit and avoiding the streamers.
---
Nothing like walking into a cleared area, then 20 mobs spawn and gank you :D
---
I adored my druid I'm Vanilla, so that's what I'm gonna be in Classic. I don't care about being the best.
---
he said not too long ago that simply using auto loot would have saved him 5 hours.
---
They always do August. 
---
I checked again because of this thread and it seems I was actually wrong, the main warlock in Ratchet is not a trainer, neither are his acolytes, though one was added in BC (Babayaga Shadowcleft), hence why I remembered that from long ago. You were right, there's no Alliance lock trainer in Kalimdor at all in Vanilla, which is crap indeed :/
---
Druid is fun levelling no doubt. It's not strong in the Lock/Hunter sense of killing power, but it's fun using cat and bear and healing and thorns/motw are good useful buffs so you always feel engaged.    
---
I kind of like priest levelling too but I understand why some people don't. You rely a lot on sw:p, wanding, scream and spirit tap to be a slow but constant force. You feel very strong after you get new swp/mindblast ranks and a new wand and then pretty weak in the gaps between but it's not too bad. It's nice that spirit is such a strong and abundant stat making gearing up fun and meaningful, whereas other classes don't really make use of spirit. One annoying thing is when playing with other people they will take your killing blows which can be a bit sad.  
---
I would probably go priest just because getting to 60 and then deciding you do want to play a lot sucks a lot when you're not on the class you actually want to play.
---
Huh. I think that’s a good point. All the guilds and streamers would scramble to pile into a couple and make those the “in” servers. You’d probably see a hierarchy with elitism and all before launch, lol.
---
Ikr oce still have player lol
---
How come you're avoiding the streamers?
---
Anyone have the knowledge of how much more damage an orc does compared to the other races? And it is my understanding that for every non-orc warrior (or human if filthy alliance) Edgemaster's Handguards become BiS for quite some time making dps warrior need yet another expensive BoE.
---
My first ever character in vanilla was an undead warrior that I got to level 16 before finding out that somebody i wanted to play with in high school (but never did) was alliance on another server. Id like to have an idea of how much id be gimping myself though.
---
Ah don't worry about that. It was a long time ago.
---
I quit the game a few weeks after that, I came back but never raided again seriously (casual guilds were unable to get any serious raiding done, it was a wipe fest :D ).
---
This is why I want classic so badly, I want to go to Naxx to beat" the game.
---
Yah he was probabaly playing on classic live that hasnt been released yet. Fuckin twat
---
Fury is marginally better at best, especially if you can't sit crit proc. Technically best to go Fury til 30 and then swap arms. 
---
Even if fury is a little better, it's not fun being a dead fish in pvp because you can't stance dance.
---
I just took a peak at your guide, but it's very cool you have a video to go along with each section.
---
The lead up to the opening of AQ. I didn't really get to take part much the first time around, real life got in the way.  
---
Also, FISHING CONTEST.
---
Because most of them are toxic idiots and so are their fans.
---
Oh look at that, another donut who has no idea what he's talking about.
---
Spawning infernals in goldshire and defending the xroads.  That is all 
---
&gt;Leveling solo is almost always faster
---
Maybe on a PvE server bud. But that protection and synergy between classes when you're at the front of the pack makes up for it. There's a reason people can rush 60 in groups of 2, 3, or even 5.
---
3. Reasonable, gear shouldn't have had such a power spike.
---
4-6. That's just like, your opinion man. The scenery was more interesting and engaging in zangarmarsh than most other zones tbh.
---
7. Dailies are indeed boring, but so is grinding 1000 timbermaw mobs. It's literally the same thing but with a new spin.
---
8. Arenas were good because you actually had to use skill. BGs could end up just being death balls of whoever focus down the right people first.
---
10. This one is basically just running dailies to get loot instead of rep, but in dungeon form.
---
11. Are you kidding me? Cata heroics were actually fun and challenging and they had to nerf them to the ground because people didn't know what an interrupt ability was or how to use them, among other things.
---
You've not even played vanilla besides Pservers and you're saying everything about the other expansions is basically trash I mean what? Come on dude seriously.
---
Classic wow didn't just kill MMO's for me. I quit video games after wow. Nothing was ever good enough after. Nothing was ever rewarding or social enough. Classic wow is a master piece. It will kill a lot. Also no there are not better mmo's out today. This crop of MMO's are the biggest pile of shit in mmo history. We have spent the last decade going backward.
---
dayum, thanks! A minute off here or there, but seems alright to me. Could've saved a lot of boring clicking and trying to read low resolution yellow text on desert backround;P
---
If you're at the front of the pack pvp is a very small issue there's barely anyone to pvp if you are going hard. People utilized dynamic respawning to level in large groups on private servers. They aren't going to utilize that.
---
Yo, I used to go downstairs in the inn at Dun Morough and /lay before logging off. That might be corny as hell, but it felt right.
---
Understandable but you answered my question regardless. It started to unravel with some of your sentences so I lost interest in responding.
---
that's a 100% increase in the amount of opportunities to be had!
---
Don't worry. They already have a script that will force forward walking animation. They just need to decide about how exactly it will trigger - in the original vanilla, it was quite unpredictable, and changed over the course.
---
Do a horde one please.
---
You're complaining about people getting better arena gear which they only got if they were actually good at PvP. I don't see how mindlessly grinding HKs for gear is a better system for loot than arena. People who are more skilled and able to do arenas better SHOULD in fact be rewarded for it. 
---
The resilience gear stat is pretty meh, a questionable design for most players, but some liked it, most probably didn't. But resilience or no res, people should be able to get gear for being skilled and not just farming WSG graveyard or AV death balls.
---
It is their fault. They decided to roll on a non-max pop realm in the first place.  They also decided to play classic.  They also decided to be unhappy about something.  Server is there. Game is there. Play and have fun or don't. Stop asking for hand outs and contingency plans to avoid even the slightest amount of discomfort. 
---
Tell the world I'm coming home
---
You keep doing you. I expect to see this in classic. 
---
&gt;loot lag
---
You mean that you had to wait like 1 second after right-clicking, before the loot window would appear?
---
You are right. No day was done for me, without clicking help -&gt; report lag -&gt; loot
---
It isn't 4k but that is the wrong way to think of it. The correct way to think of it is 72 straight hours of farming the pieces, in shifts so your guild is literally there 24/7. 
---
Teldrassil, because I think I still remember the way in Ban'Ethil Barrow Dens. By heart, without using the "mist".
---
my highly scientific random thoughts say it will be Aug 9th
---
This is incorrect. Rend damage does suck but it’s more damage and more rage efficient than heroic strike. Rend loses value once you get MS until then use it.
---
I'm generally the same. I was a CE raider in retail for a while. Classic is so much more complex, and I prefer hybrid classes just because I can cover more bases with a single build. Often the pure dps or healing builds are too limited within the scope of Classic's endgame as a whole, I've found. While in raid ability is huge, I've found it's usually better overall to take a small hit in raw throughput in order to have a build that has more options. You have the opportunity to apply your kit to encounters in creative ways, and solve problems in a way that conventional builds can't.

Moonwalking is client side only, you look normal to everyone else.
---
&gt; You're complaining about people getting better arena gear which they only got if they were actually good at PvP. I don't see how mindlessly grinding HKs for gear is a better system for loot than arena. People who are more skilled and able to do arenas better SHOULD in fact be rewarded for it.
---
&gt; 
---
WOW was a progress-based, not skill-based game. Before TBC, you couldn't lose anything you already have accomplished. Skill only reduced the grind, or increased your chances.
---
In Vanilla, maybe there was some gear reserved for the top players, but you could always work towards it - and the only way to lose your progress, would be by working not enough.
---
In arenas, the more you worked, the more you would get down in the ranking.
---
They will add one for launch, mark my words. They're manufacturing another thing to "listen to the community" on. I guarantee it.
---
Nice! 
---
That's strictly bear druids though, iirc some of their high rank gear is BiS even in Naxx because of its excellent tanking stats. It's not really any good for healing or dpsing now is it? Excellent for flag running sure, but not much else. We also have to look at the two different versions of the blue and epic sets. If they implement the original version then that is just completely useless for nearly every class. If they implement the second version then it will have its uses. As a warlock I will go for the rank 10 set, specifically head + shoulder is a pretty good set, only really replacable by Mish'undare and Mantle of the Black Cabal, however if they implement the first version then those items are hardly even better than the pre-bis, which is a real shame because rank 10 is definitely not easy. Even the rank 13 items are not much better than even T2 and of course the rank 14 weapons are garbage for casters being on the same level as MC/ZG items. 
---
Blade runner reference = take my upvotes 
---
Been fixed since wotlk iirc
---
Who hurt you
---
I can try to explain, it’s simply the fact that the world is alive thanks to lack of flying mounts. Limited flight points and the fact no ones even mounted until 40, tie that in with some VERY aggressive PvP ganking and you have the perfect scientific formula to create unique player interactions. Every. Single. Time. You. Play. 
---
I don’t think any other main stream mmo ever had that going for it 
---
&lt;Hold my Beer&gt;
---
This whole hamstring method is hilarious to me. It may work in the starting zone, where mobs are neutral, but as soon as you leave it there will be warriors dying left and right from aggroing hostile mobs. 
---
If a priest of shadows you play, melted the faces will be.
---
For being the least played class, you guys sure fill a lot.
---
I think July is a fair guess. 2nd or 3rd week after the holiday is my guess. 
---
I am going to roll druid + rogue multibox.
---
I just changed my mind from priest warrior, because I cant wait to stealth all the way through STV being the one doing the ganking.
---
Lol OK good. That makes me feel better since now I wasn't flying all over to train skills on EK for nothing ; )
---
When's pax?
---
I'm not sure you understand where I'm coming from, but ok. I'm just not interested in being on the same server as a bunch of whiny, screeching streamers and their followers.
---
You're not speaking of tier pieces? What kind of stuff?
---
There's a fresh vanilla server (kinda a joke of a server but whatever) coming up here tomorrow at 5pm GMT+1, perhaps you some speedy leveler will stream there. I will be my self, but I'm gonna be slow ass warrior :D
---
I used to have one recurring where I'd be getting attacked by a high level and would try to /camp but it wouldn't work. It was p stressful 
---
For picking a server, I feel it will be a crapshoot.  Picking a server with a Horde name or Alliance name would probably be proportional to the popularity of the name.  (A server named Thrall having tons of Horde)
---
For later on, I’d love to see on the server select screen with the following info:
---
-Total current population (playing in game now)
---
-Total active population (daily/weekly/monthly, whichever is most sensible and easiest)
---
-Total current population per faction (playing in game now)
---
-Total active population per faction (daily/weekly/monthly)
---
(This needs to show active account population, not character population due to alt rolling)
---
I’m open to being wrong or being told what’s wrong with this type of data being shown.  At this present time, I can only see a problem being that Blizzard ends up with servers that are underutilized by player decisions with this info.  In the long run, I feel this information would actually benefit the servers.
---
That is very true. I love the feeling of seeing red, wondering he they are going to dismount or /wave lol.
---
And in my farm spots I actually have  tendancy to look at where they may be coming from. Or if they suddenly pop up on my screen I have to make a desicion based on how they are reacting to me. There is so much more to it then just killing nameless npc.
---
Even the thrill, and yes its definitely a thrill of defending yourself from an attack/gank I dont get anywhere else in life. Fuck even spotting a black lotus ar lvl 60 is more hype to me each time then anything else. 
---
/say
---
Uh wtf 
---
&gt; 4-6 That's just like, your opinion man. The scenery was more interesting and engaging in zangarmarsh than most other zones tbh.
---
I agree. I am not trying to say that "TBC was worse", I am trying to say "I liked TBC less".
---
&gt; Dailies are indeed boring, but so is grinding 1000 timbermaw mobs.
---
But with 1000 timbermaw mobs, there is nobody forcing you. You can grind all of them now, or tomorrow or maybe never... unless at some day you feel hardworking.
---
The daily system is basically enforcing your playtime schedule - you have to play that one hour today, and one tomorrow. Not two tomorrow. World quests.
---
I hope you're right, but I'm not convinced Blizzard is smart enough for that kind of ruse.
---
This 100%. Add fucking invisible walls in BGs or whatever to keep people from abusing it competitively. I had so much fun exploring an instanced version of Azeroth with a buddy after we climbed out of ZG. Taking trips to the top of Org and the bottom of Stormwind. The little fishing shack in Elwynn. The hole. Hyjal. Fuck exploration was fun back then. 
---
&gt; I assume you just walk around Blinded while in Vanish when that happens?
---
No it's actually like when you vanish a death coil, sometimes you'll stay in stealth and sometimes you get knocked out of it but you will be unaffected by the spell that was cast on you.  I'm not sure what causes the sometimes being knocked out of vanish and sometimes staying in it though but if you can do it then it's basically like having another pvp trinket.
---
&gt; it kind of made me a little sad because just several months before Cataclysm, I had learned how to use Vanish on some obvious boss AoEs in Vault of Archavon and other raids, which allowed me to save Cloak of Shadows.
---
Yeah it was little things like this that were really cool about the game in its early stages.  Idiosyncrasies that took a lot of figuring out, but were really cool to see when it happened.
---
Another great point, we all love pally bluffs and blessings. 
---
Hi, /u/HowaitoHasugami
---
Hey it's me, your not neighbor. 
---
It's most likely the fact that RP servers require more customer support. That's probably the initial reasoning for having less RP servers. but enough people are upset about it they'll add 1 or 2. 
---
:(
---
Yeah I had a feeling that a competent developer wouldn't really have an issue implementing such a system if they wanted to.
---
&gt; meaning 
---
This is the key word. It's all about meaning. 
---
When I played Vanilla I cleaned this desk once a week because it felt good to have a clean space. Effort expended led to a reward. If, 14 years later, I had a child who liked to take things out of the garbage and recycling and put them back on my desk then I would not clean it often because the effort would be meaningless. 
---
Basically. World of Warcraft forgot the world and the war to become- craft (your ideal dress up avatar ) 
---
It doesn't change difficulty much but it does change gameplay and it's fun to change things up.
---
It's just a technique to take way less damage while fighting mobs, so you can increase your kills per hour
---
Never really did Maraudon before. Going to have to check it out this time around. Didn't do all of SM either. I played on dialup....my instance experience was limited to when I went to my friends house to play on real internet.
---
I mean, do you watch sports? Cooking shows? Sometimes you just wanna chill out instead of putting effort into something. Streams are another good way to see a game played that you'd never buy. 
---
EU? You mean 2 each for German, French, English, Spanish, Russian,...?
---
Exact number is still unknown of course but it's a safe bet that there will be at least 5 or 6 languages.
---
Joana’s original run is slow af. Varrak is a far better speedrunner than Joana. 
---
I think the highest I've seen was almost 40%, I know you can hit 30% relatively easy, on warriors at least
---
I can get behind the idea of watching someone play who's really good at a game. I don't see the appeal for WoW however, unless it's maybe a literal speedrun to 60.
---
Warrior + Paladin of course. It gives you so much mobility it’s the most fun you can have as a Warrior in vanilla pvp. 
---
I think we would be very surprised at how far along they really are. There has never really been a launch like this for them. Acting like they are only so far along when really they are using it as a hype building tool.
---
Its not just a new game its something that has already been established and released before. Personally i think them surprise launching it would explode the popularity even more and more so to new people who have not played it. 
---
I have confidence that they would have 90% of the game perfect. That final 10% will be fixed in a short period after launch no biggie. If anything it makes it even more like vanilla was for the actual launch.
---
While i do not share this opinion of "Gear is worthless" (most probably because i only ever reached max lvl during legion on retail and didn't play back in vanilla) i'm having a hard time understanding where it comes from.
---
The current system issues have allways been there to some degree right ? RNG, catchup, non upgrade drop ect.
---
According to the classic fans the balance was even worse back in vanilla where raid drops were sometimes worse than blue. 
---
I understand social aspect but were the rewards really on point ? Having only read posts about vanilla and not playing myself i may be wrong about that but it feels like classic is more about rewarding time spent than actual challenge. 
---
It does not mean there was no challenges, just that the best way to clear them was to spend as much time as possible. Some class quests differs from this idea but overall that's the idea (rep per mob, farm for gold/mats, PvP ranks, attunements, resist gear &amp; conso ect)
---
Everything comes down to a grind, and spending more time than overs makes you a more successful player.
---
I do not mean that grinding is bad design (although some were, like the PvP ranks) but it feels that unless you played X hours doing some specific task or action, you can't join the content you're looking for or do not perform well enough.
---
Time spend was more valuable than it is today and i think that's why blizzard changed it's philosophy. 
---
You can't expect your oldest players to have as much time as they once did before they worked or had a family. 
---
Anyway, am i on point about this time spend feeling ? No judgement here, just trying to understand how it was or felt.
---
Getting ganked by rogues in Stranglethorn Vale while trying to hunt those stealth panthers for a quest is not just a dream I have had before, but weirdly also a memory that frequently reenters my head out of the blue year after year like some sort of weird WoW PTSD.
---
FBI this man right here
---
When I was raiding on my first main in early vanilla we had the auction dkp system. I hated it cause I got tricked into wasting a lot of dkp on an item I really didn't need to waste dkp on, it was embarassing (I was young and gullible). On my second main I mainly focused on pvp and had a semi-premade/half-pug raid group for ZG and AQ20. Then we only had a loot council, I think? Regulars sometimes got priority on items but it wasn't set in stone.
---
My favourite DKP system was in BC. We had what wikipedia calls "simple dkp": The simplest DKP variation is one where every item has a set price list and each player earns some specified number of DKP each time they participate in a guild raid.[13] Like zero-sum systems, the player with the most points recorded actually received the item, paying the specified price. Unlike zero-sum, a simple DKP system does not compensate the rest of the raid based in the value of the items received.
---
Druid pvp mostly consists of running the flag, which they are the kings of. They can also be very handy to support rogues and capture flags. A skilled Druid in PvP is a nightmare to deal with. 
---
But if you don’t want to heal sadly your PvE options are very limited. There’s no reason to bring a Druid to a raid when a rogue can dps better and a warrior can tank better. So you’re stuck healing or maybe off tanking, but the dps is bad. 
---
There will most definitely be a blue post April fools joke on Monday. Lets just hope that its “RELEASE DATE CONFIRMED AUGUST 2019!!..APRIL FOOLS THE SERVERS ARE LIVE TODAY!”
---
Dude Vanilla was 14 years ago and I was older than you are now !
---
So yes you're really young :D
---
&gt;In arenas, the more you worked, the more you would get down in the ranking
---
If you're bad I guess. The rankings worked the way they did for reason.
---
It's hard when you're old. I don't know where to find any :(
---
Ah... the legendary Journey.  
---
Joanna said on his last stream that it was confirmed that Journey had indeed used an exploit to get his 3 day and 7 hour time to 60, which is something that pretty much everyone suspected. I'm personally inclined to believe him, since I've come across the same kind of exploit during my time on private servers. 
---
People can't really stream private servers reliably out of fear of being banned so I don't think you'll see anyone serious streaming before Classic.  
---
As far as videos go... there are some that are decent, and there are some that are trying to mislead people. Like the videos advising people to explore in the early levels, for example. Just search youtube and be mindful that not everything you see is going to be legit.  
---
As far as routes go... Joanna's updated horde route is inefficient. Maybe that's because he's too busy dealing with class specific guides and an alliance guide, who knows...  
---
The fact is that if you want an optimal route, you're going to have to make one yourself and at this point you're a bit too late to the party, so Joanna's might be your best bet.  
---
If you're looking for speedrunning communities you can try the thread over at barrens.chat and Joanna's discord. Please keep in mind that creating a route and working on refining it can take a long ass time, so don't expect people to just let you in on their strategies.
---
I made a character of private server and there was one thing that immediately caught me by surprise. I made a tauren druid and casted wrath at a mob....once. I didn't have the mana to cast wrath back to back at level 1 lol. You have to buy water from an inn/mage, and that is something foreign to retail. Resource management is largely a thing of the past, but in Vanilla it is very real.
---
I don't disagree.
---
But they're playing 2 different games. Varrak was playing a version where quests gave significantly better XP after a certain point.
---
I don't think Varrak's run would have beaten 3 days 22 hours without the incorrect XP rates of the server he played on tho.
---
It's comparing apples to apple flavored oranges.
---
Actually druid is the reverse, you need to pvp in order to play feral in pve, since the druid pvp gear is very strong and there's huge gaps in the eve gear available for the spec.
---
As for feral dps, feral dps is just not a thing in vanilla. There's a place in guilds for a dedicated bear OT who can dps when not tanking, since a cat dosing is better than a prot warrior trying to dps. In this role you'll also need to be open to filling a utility role, for example during a fight where cursing is a thing, you're more likely to be decursing to let the mages focus on dps than going cat form. 
---
For most streamers, it’s a cult of personality. They have personas and a sense of humor that makes people want to see more. Ninja is, apparently, playing Uno in protest of some new Fortnite update. His followers are still watching, so it’s not always about the gameplay.
---
Then there’s the wild loyalty that gets shown. When Asmongold played the Classic demo, there were other people who rolled the same faction as him JUST so they could follow him around. My favorite example of loyalty is PewDeePie. In the MIDST of cancel culture, he made anti-Semitic comments and dropped the n-word mid-stream, but his followers are so fiercely loyal that he got a pass.
---
I don’t want to play with people like that. People who are going to guild with Esfand JUST to make sure he sets Sulfras or Ashkandi, harming their own progression just so they can boost their favorite streamer.
---
I find it weird. AF. I have no issue with it - y’all do your thing and live your best life, I just don’t want to play with people like that.
---
Various reputations could be grinded without needing to do Dailies. The netherguard ray faction and netherwing factions could both be done without dailies for example (at least after the initial quests). The bird men dropped feathers and some kind of shadow elixir which could be used to summon Terokk's spirit or whatever who gave rep and the netherwing eggs could be farmed. 
---
I did both on an alt in maybe 10-20 hrs of grinding each across a couple days.
---
Perhaps “bank char” woulda been a better description. But also you missed that part where I said don’t spend?
---
This would rage people out wayyyyyy too much it would have to be the OTHER way. Them saying the release is official but super far away then APRIL FOOLS its actually coming out way sooner.
---
 It HAS to end a positive note there is no way their PR is so dumb to just troll the fan base and piss them off.  
---
vanilla wow is best experienced solo anyways, even if you do play with friends its hard to sync up your schedules and playtimes.  and eventually even if you all reach level 60, some of the friends will be casual, some hardcore, its a pain in the ass to play with people who are not on the same "level" so to speak.
---
&gt; but I think that’s just hunters having a slow 1-10 more than anything
---
Hunter 1-10 blows especially 7 to 10 but after that it speeds up dramatically. 
---
Yiew!!! Spell Batching made it in! I can't believe it.
---
The shawshank redemption post inspired me.  There's a lot of potential for solid memes.
---
absolute chad
---
Yea i second this there's no way in hell there PR could be that stupid as to do a April fools joke that doesn't end with a SUPER positive punch line
---
I just remember back when we were all new and starting MC that Guilds (and one on our server had a dev playing ((supposedly)) in it) -- and they were adamant about FR gear, especially for Rag.  I remember farming Scholo for the blue FR pants, and farming the Corner in EPL or WPL with the dark casters for the green pattern of FR gear.
---
And then came the runs to Strath for the NR drop (reset, kill boss, reset, kill boss, etc.) and the decimation of Maradon in the same way.  
---
But then, we were Horde, had great healers in AQ40, NR from our hunters and shammies.  :)  You know, easy mode!
---
Did you even stop to think of the consequences of this? Every single bwl raider getting the head week one out trying to farm the same mobs for carapases? You think 1 head per week was a shit show but you don’t think that would be?
---
The scarab lord mount is so cool because of the exclusivity. If you want it then put in the work. If you don’t have the social skills to get a raid team to help you then your only other option is to farm enough gold to pay for the help. 1-2k gold per raider might be enough lol. 
---
I went nelf... depends on your circumstance. If you are playing with a regular group you only need two dwarves MAX, at that point it would be better for the rest of the priests to be human for the extra spirit. It’s just in casual guilds that have a forever changing roster you really want to be dwarf, so you have ward just in case. A guild will take a great healer of any race, and there tends to be 5-6 priests in a 40 man.
---
I agree! But Tyrande is so cool looking... 😍
---
Wish I could say I was getting paid for these ads but it’s just Wordpress. If I get enough traffic come classic I’ll upgrade :)
---
With Trolls basking in the glory as well. 
---
&gt;People utilized dynamic respawning to level in large groups on private servers.
---
On non-kronos servers dynamic didn't work with localized increases, only large population increases in the zone.
---
People have done it to great effect. It isn't easy but you actually don't know what you're talking about if you think solo is always best.
---
Danish too hard to understand? lol
---
lol who the hell still plays retail?
---
That's what you tell the haters.
---
Appreciate your comment! I think now that the timeline is released I can easily update the BiS list per patch when I have time. I reckon they’ll keep itemisation pretty close.
---
In Vanilla the grinding feels meaningful and that's fun. On retail nothing feels meaningful. Gold have no value and gear have no value after the next patch...
---
Balance - I’ve seen a few Druids raiding as Balance. Their dps is mediocre and they go oom fast, but the crit buff is very nice. Stick a Balance Druid in a group with 4 Fire Mages and they’ll love him. 
---
Feral is decent. If you’re good enough you can do competitive raid dps. But the rogues will hate you for taking their gear. Feral tanks are also good. You can tank 4 horseman as feral. 
---
Ret - Again I’ve seen them raid but their dps is bottom tier. No serious guild will ever take a Ret. 
---
Shadow - Most guilds will bring 1 or 0 shadow priests. So not really viable.
---
Elemental - Not viable at all. Do mediocre dps and go oom stupidly fast. 
---
Enhance - Casual guilds might bring 1 enhance for the totems and nightfall. But any serious guild will never bring one. 
---
Arms - Mid tier dps. But very few Warriors raid as Arms when Fury is so strong. 
---
Fury- God tier spec. Strongest dps throughout all of vanilla and nothing comes close. Does not belong in this list. 
---
Mulgore, TG -- awesome zones -- Mulgore for it's beauty, TG for it's darkness and sinister feeling.
---
But I gotta say...  After FINALLY leveling an Alliance (never have completed EPL or WPL quests) -- Horde leveling is much harder.  Mulgore -- go into that 'den' -- kill X amount of mobs, then go back in and kill the boss and his 2 minions.  TG -- go down into the crypts and kill that boss and his minions.
---
Alliance -- here, take these shoes and this note to another city.
---
And ya wonder why they cry for fear ward!  :)
---
thats not right, you should be able to cast a bunch of wraths at lvl 1 - and your natural mana regen (after 5 seconds not casting) is really high
---
but yeah water is pretty important for mana users after a couple of levels.  it only gets worse from there!  its very expensive too
---
i like these things, even though it is a pain in the ass, because thats what life is like.  its not convenient!
---
Same. I could never focus on any other game again afterwards. Everything felt like a waste of time compared to Vanilla WoW.
---
Yea, dude. One of our friends had other friends playing WoW so we were all introduced. I actually hit it off really well with this one girl but it didn't help that my gf was in our guild and so was her bf.
---
You forgot the best thing about Mulgore.
---
Those filthy, hairy bull women.  And she's horny, too.  :)
---
No no no no... that’s even a big point of Classic. That would kill Darnassus entirely. It’s cool to have some places where Classes meet / you are forced to travel. 
---
On top of that, everything just felt much more rewarding back then, now in BFA where the game just lacks heart, doing all the things you would do in vanilla just feels like a chore with no reward. 
---
&gt;Varrak is a far better speedrunner than Joana. 
---
you cant compare the skill of two speedrunners by looking at two runs that are over 10 years apart.
---
There will likely be a ton of working addons as long as they have a beta
---
hahaha what a snowflake
---
You realise these "raid finders" you're trying to make fun of aren't some sort of Plague that should be eradicated right ?
---
Also sorry to pop your bubble but these things won't work out the way they did. People already know how and when the content will be released and World PvP / ankiraj won't ever be the same. (Some already plan to stockpile the supplies items at launch)
---
Hope you'll have fun at southshore while it last tho. It died during vanilla, it might in classic.
---
if you arent raiding with a guild in classic wow you arent really important enough to give a fuck about
---
Funny enough I'm in the opposite boat and hoping it won't bite me in the butt. 4 or 5 if my IRL friends and myself are going to be playing together and even starting our own guild for ourselves. That of course means we will hypothetically rarely do content with people outside of ourselves (with the exception of questing, perhaps) which means we are sort of putting ourselves on our own island so to speak. My experience back in the day was that all my best friends in-game I made via dungeons. I look forward to making to friends while playing, so I'm hoping I don't shoot myself in the foot in that respect for having a turn-key group all the time. 
---
I dont want all you min maxers harassing me playing my undead warrior, with my buddy playing a resto druid and another on a enh shaman.
---
Plz pick a server so i can go elsewhere. 
---
Frost your undead characters use the exact same hair and face that mine did when I played for ~5 years so watching your videos with the Mage or Rogue are just extra neat to me.

If they give us an estimated release date too early and before they know what it will be, if they postpone it you'll just get mad at Blizzard for "lying to you."
---
This is not meant to be a Varrak vs Joana competition. I was more impressed by Varrak's route and gameplay from what is recorded and available on youtube. Joana is great to and I hope as a community we can get better and better at leveling. The wiki format hopefully will help keep things updated and relevant.

Their list of porn stars is so outdated.

I will play a shaman in Classic but if I was you I would make a paladin. Nothing feels more rewarding than casting Blessing of freedom on a warrior who is ganking a mage ;)
---
I disagree, I want them to announce it so I can stay the fuck away.
---
Sounding like an angry entitled nerd isn’t a good way to make an argument 😋
---
will do! Thanks!
---
What do you consider old? And why do I have the feeling that you're like 25 and already having a mid-life crisis
---
&gt;With loot as desirable and scarce as it is in vanilla, I don’t think I’ll be the only one who experiences a bad side of these loot shenanigans in Classic
---
For sure - with so many players used to free floods of loot, and rapid improvements to class performance happening so quickly and from so many progression systems, there will be people who are completely not used to wanting an scarce / highly sought after item so damn badly. There will be loot shenanigans for sure, because people are not used to the concept of 5% of the raid getting loot after 3 hours of content. And not only that, in order to traverse the world and feel capable of taking on a couple mobs, and basically feel like a badass at all, you need to have your purples, so every gear-up really feels so impactful and important. 
---
I do not envy people planning on fury or rogue, or people wanting to do 2h shammy or ret "memespecs" that need the already rare and highly sought after 2hers. 
---
Just as you may have your feelings, which seem set on having this feature. 
---
Imo being able to recognise the people you face from time to time is part of the vanilla experience. I want to fight people, not names. 
---
To be sure, It alone will not make the difference between a world and a hub, but it is one step in the direction. Eventually we’ll have taken to many steps and there will be no way back.
---
Is changing druid forms necessary to be good at pvp? Are using hunter traps necessary to be good at pvp? Is using stealth necessary to be good at pvp?   
---
There's nothing special about 'stance dancing', it's just using core class abilities. Yes not using them for some strange reason will severely limit you in pvp (and pve).

We rudely bullied the only quality content(that guy doing zone art) off the sub that wasn't class guides.
---
most everything else is complaining.
---
I'm just here for the bluepost links.

Pretty much. It’s a single player q hub. It might claim to put you with other real players, but they might as well just be names.
---
Alliance warrior or horde warrior?
---
Is windfury a no brainer?
---
can't you figure it out through armory pretty quick?  All the people that are intent on helping or hindering that streamer aren't going to be deterred so easily.
---
I wholeheartedly agree
---
Dude yea i agree this shit would not only rage us out everyone would be fcking pissed.  
---
The joke better fcking start with a believable bad thing (like an August release date etc.) and end on a happy note of something like a much sooner real release date.

Their PR has to be MORONS if they do an April fools joke trolling the Classic community in a bad way. It HAS to be a positive punch line ending on some really good news other wise it will have a strongly negative impact on the community.

Did you ever consider some of us weren't lucky the first time around due to rng? I had a power house raid guild. I hate the rng of it
---
Why would you want a mob of goon ballwashers following a streamer around at all times?
---
Was 15 when I bought it, and I assume we had approx the same thoughts in mind. Oh if only I could go back! Totally picked the right mmo to kickstart the gamingcareer!
---
Vs footage from 2006?
---
Besides, the demo numbers where not dialed in yet. So they are not finale. 
---
Came here for this.  
---
Tasty tasty RP.  Love it.
---
&gt;How about Twitch streamers hmm idk, how about you just dont.
---
their (usually rabid / 30iq, hi asmongold chat!) fans would find out in 5 minutes and it'd no longer be a secret. Then congrats, you've got to deal with that chat for the next 4,000 hours.
---
I understand why you would want the helm, but why 2 ?
---
Yeah, I mean Joana himself said he could probably take a day of /played off his run. 
---
It blows my mind that people think this is an appropriate response. 
---
how is Joanas updated guide inefficient? He just ran through it with a time of 3 hours and 22 hours.
---
Sfk for sf or assassin's blade would net some scrilla
