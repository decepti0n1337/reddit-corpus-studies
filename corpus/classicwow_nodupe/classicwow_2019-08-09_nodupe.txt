If I were there I would wisp someone else in that line and say something like "this quest its going to take forever, do you want party and kill higher level mobs?" or something like that. Waiting for +20 respawns can't be faster or more engaging that doing that

What does stress test mean ?

Try a library, often times if they don't have a book they'll even order it if people make the request.

Yeah joking apart I prefer no changes.

Bank space is also at a premium (especially with no alts guild guild bank) Yes I'm a hoarder :p But to store all the vanity pets really would use a lot of space.

You're right, it's overpriced.

I should offer $2500 and see if they'll take it....
---
I'd just leave and go grind out the equivilent XP elsewhere. not worth the headache.
---
Sodapoppin, venruki, cdew, are all better than probably 99.9% of players on this sub.

Haha, good luck

Wow it looks amazing. So glad for the graphic improvements

https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons Click version and scroll down to classic. Make sure you click the file tab for the addon you want and get the game version 1.13.2

I get mine from Twitch

here's [my screenshot](https://imgur.com/3MlaswY) of us doing the same thing, Horde Daggerspine.

It was good times :)

Especially the non-named ones. I.e. sarkoth was taking a bit longer to respawn than normal scorpids
---
It's a little different if a few people read from one copy than for tens of thousands to read from one copy.
---
Quite often as a hunter you want to kill something without marking and get full mana regen for the whole fight, or mark early when you're out of range - with your macro you be would cast it twice for no reason.

Wait until you're stuck on a server with a major streamer

Why would they? Lmao.
---
Found someone in the pic.

Sadly, that's the most likely scenario.

it does, unfortunately.

I suppose I should have clarified I meant 20k people in the login queue. I can provide source on request.

Some people actually think that steamers can be good for server communities...
---
Only add-ons I have successfully got to work are Questie and monkey quest. Any other add-ons working?
---
Kind of getting sick of people asking this. Theyve said it so many times, no. For god's sake, launch is August 27. Not August 8 or 9, or 12 or 13 or whatever. FFS
---
A classic wow post hating on streamers??? COlor me suprised
---
You can use BfA graphics if you want, but the default setting is on 'classic'.
---
Retail wow has a Refresh rate separate from the Foreground FPS. Classic does not but can be set via OPs trick

Viability comes down to which People You Meet, which Guild you join, and if they are alright with you raiding as the spec you want to go as
---
no addon, its just darker blizzard textures and couple custom fonts in Fonts folder
---
lol he's probably a retail player who just posts nonsense on this sub.
---
Did anyone get CastBars to work?
---
If private servers were indicative, absolutely.  We always had a couple enh dps shams in our 40- man's and they were midpack in DPS while providing buffs to their melee groups. Elemental had a much harder time. Resto were superb.
---
AtlasLoot worked perfectly
---
is there an exact time when its over instead of a date .... i assume midnight?&gt;
---
When there's no pay wall its just a big "assholes welcome here" sign.
---
Because it slides into a chassis which feeds it power and connectivity. It's not a full standalone computer, and a blade is a term used to describe this functionality...also used in networks. It's a way to pack a lot of processing power into a small space
---
This is the chassis the server blade would have slotted into

I place him in the ‚Äúwatchable‚Äù pool of streamers where genuine opinion is present from time to time. I like him from time to time, but would never play on the same server if it‚Äôs PVP.
---
Why howl + aimed shot? Howl adds to any damage ability you do as, multi shot,... If you'd choose to bind it to a spell it's better to do multi shot.
---
Have you considered fasting? It will reduce the frequency and volume of the larger loads during this critical time.

I prefer the original graphics and to be completely honest it will probably ruin my enjoyment not having them

I hope it does. The fact that people have no idea how to pronounce it will discourage non-RPers.

"What server are you on?"

"Blue-moo!"

We don't.. only want to play with Norwegians..? Re-read the post please. Also, each to their own, right?
---
Good, so how would one set them apart from warriors aside from using what sets them apart from warriors?
---
lol i just set up my pc desk over the toilet
---
Do you lose your characters after the stress test ends
---
If you go into the karazan area you could get into a spoopy crypt through dying or wall walking or something I forget.
---
Much like with religion the followers are the real problem :P
---
On the other hand, only play on a PVP server if you want the danger of getting killed to be a part of your leveling experience
---
Everyone would/should be happy with a toggle

I had to raise the gamma when I went inside a keep and I couldn't see anything.

holy shit that was the server I played on!

Have you considered changing the mouse look sensitivity instead of the mouse sensitivity?
---
Does anyone know which addon puts an exclamation mark on top of enemy name plates? (Enemies that are involved in a quest ie. kill 5 bears, and the bears will have exclamation marks over their name plates).
---
Super annoying, i want to get rid of it. 
---
I initially thought it was AAP, but i asked on their Discord and they didn‚Äôt believe it was AAP doing it.
---
I also choose this guy's dead wife.

---
The face of that idiot is so damn punchable
---
If you disagree with a toggle, then you are just selfish
---
dick.
---
Oh sure, I bet there will, but de-incentivizing it goes a long way to combat how much of an effect it has on the game experience by both potential exploiters as well as the rest of the players. Layers as a whole go against #nochanges so it's bound to come with all kinds of hangs that'll drive discussions for years to come.
---
As a lvl 1 I got whacked by a lvl 5 I couldn‚Äôt kill from over 10yards away. Got away but was really surprised by the range.
---
Based on the stress test, do you think it would be better to take time off work at launch or a few days later?
---
I'm sure there will be plenty of reenactors.
---
Pitbulls are shit though, I've have (had) 3 friends with Pitbulls. 1 bit a kid, 1 bit a grown, the last one is relative young and already gets too aggressive and bites everything. Won't be too long till it's put down too. No, it's not the owners, it's the breed. You're just mad it doesn't align with your politics.
---
They're supposed to be that "bad boy" that the girlfriend or teacher shows everyone that they actually have a heart of gold and were good all along. Nah, life's not a movie. Sure outliers exist, but ignoring them for the average is when you live in the fantasy world.
---
Don't get me wrong, original Blizzard was a fantastic team. I miss them dearly - but there's a reason why I make so many references to Activision. Blizzard as a company is long gone.
---
This has to be a bad troll post....
---
Its ok friend, not trying to argue
---
u got a point there
---
what a weird thing to trip out on. It's a cup, pretty sure its made to be drank from lol. HEY WATCH OUT! THAT CUP WAS MADE IN CHINA YOU'RE GONNA DIIIIIIE
---
Blau -&gt; Blow
---
Meux-&gt; https://youtu.be/jHCMN7RRWMo with an "m" at the beginning.
---
I mean it does increase the odds of being able to play with IRL friends, a thing that's defined several chapters of my history with the game.
---
Idk exactly it was in a blue post some time ago
---
I'm in a similar boat with working weird hours, I'm just keeping an eye out for a Guild with raid times I can actually show up to.
---
As a former LoL and Dota2 player I declare that statement to be true =(
---
They do, this guy on Runescape sat in his own shit for hours only to lose to a normal guy
---
Pets start casting before mobs appear so more often than not the imps 2.0 cast  can grab the mob if people get slack on their tab target
---
Probably bottom three of all specs when it comes to raiding.
---
do people think this is what happened in classic
---
Many interface options are saved on the character though, so some will have to be redone. For example, frame placement and action bars come to mind.
---
I am super encouraged to hear that.
---
there's a way to automatic track a quest without press L + shift click?
---
I have TBC and WotlK intros on my car audio memory pen
---
Not many things are more trashy than Asmongold but pitbulls sure are one of them.
---
But how did people manage to join his specific layer? 
---
You can choose the server but the layer is random surely????
---
Yes officer this guy
---
I feel like this is some internal marketing scheme to set us up for when they inevitably add the option for updated graphics. 
---
Surely there is nobody that genuinely wants this enough to slander the original graphics.
---
Well you need tongues on the pally.  We will have to 2v2 in classic.
---
I see, thank you. That would make a lot of these macros useless.
---
Worked just fine for me. Amazon delivered instantly after order, redeemed the code on Blizzard's site with no trouble.
---
the laptop guy is using arrow keys to move in gameeee
---
Most of his stream is spent watching other videos.  I have no idea how hes so popular.
---
Hey I am on the stress test but I don't see things like recount on here, where exactly do you "choose" 1.13.2
---
Do you have questie installed? I know theres a option in that.
---
I would argue that it sounds exactly like tool would sound at the current era!
---
Alex = Furor Planedefiler from Fires of Heaven, I believe.

The game is perfectly playable on a modern widescreen monitor (they fixed widescreen issues in one of the more recent patches so it's actually got native widescreen support) and for me it's not about the graphics anyway. With that said, I'm sure Reforged will look more polished so it might be worth the waiting.
---
I'm quite surprised they didn't take advantage of the opportunity to launch Reforged earlier, before Classic gets released. I can imagine many hyped Classic players would have been eager to play it.
---
Weewoo fanboy alarm activated
---
Working fine for me.
---
Ok fine, *autoloot was in vanilla*. However, the way autoloot works in Classic is not how it works in Vanilla. You had to hold down shift, the interface checkbox removing the hotkey requirement (so just right clicking looted everything) was added in TBC.  
---
  
---
Correct, aoe looting was added much later, like Cata or Mop or something.
---
Yeah, nearly all of them.  You might look [at these](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c6mt68/followup_to_10_button_or_less_a_casestudy_with_my/) to see if there's anything you like.
---
If theres a HDD in there I'd guess around 10 pounds or 4.5KG, 8 pounds / 3.6KG without

Me and my close friend that will 100% be playing together have recruited 5 other friends that will no doubt quit within the 1st month/ week.
---
We hope they stay but they will most likely be a good source of linen cloth
---
Oh, duh! I'm just not used to seeing them like that! I like it!
---
It let me cast spells but it felt laggy.
---
They didn‚Äôt ‚Äúadd‚Äù it, Classic uses the Legion/BFA engine.
---
Hah yeah, I joined about an hour after the stress test started and it was still highly competitive for mobs.
---
If this was the China server it would be mayhem. Ever see a Chinese airport?
---
Hey me and my brother is in the picture. My younger brother who is 14 is just seeing classic for the first time after I‚Äôve been telling him a ton of stories about it. 
---
You guys were neat. I wish you good fortune!
---
This is fantastic, thank you.
---
Any shaman ones?
---
eg:
---
TotemTimers
---
Lol.
---
So true.
---
Just invite everyone around you. Easy.
---
This must be a private server thing, I never saw this in vanilla or TBC
---
Also looking for a solution for this !
---
Its a good song imo but not mind blowing, cant wait till they release Invincible on spotify though that song is the nutz
---
Actually it's the same 14 year old game, it's not a new game.
---
Dude... I seriously almost downloaded a app that is just a countdown timer for launch.
---
I miss the dedication I used to put into games and I'm looking forward to that feeling on the 26th and beyond.
---
Sir Ketchup_Sniper,
---
Please come write for us at /r/wowcirclejerk, we could use more material like this!
---
The books are generally fucking incredible. Would recommend reading Arthas and buying as many of the early books as you can find/have time to read. Wat of the Ancients is great, gosh all of them are great.
---
Not a gm. It‚Äôs somebody who hasnt logged in since the blizzcon demo hence the timer debuff
---
Sigh. Everyone knows WoW is about teamwork. The only way to level is during a drug fueled orgy, where the most exhausted is forced to play. You can hit 60 in four short days with about 5.2 people.
---
I think you're putting race/faction choice up on a pedestal
---
You've clearly never met a true competitor
---
sounds about incel
---
You forgot to rate your actual life : 0
---
This made me wanna play wow again.
---
If i set all keybinds now it will be there on launch ? Same question for setting other options like graphics.
---
So integral. Stealing blizzards ip.

Do we know what that is? I mean, I know theres no list yet, but have they made some kind of announcement that they all plan to pick something together? PVP? PVE?

They forgot to remove the minimap clock

I'm fairly certain the answer to this is yes.
---
You are a coward
---
I thought Swamp of Sorrows had been taken already but I was thinking of Sea of Sorrows in GW2 (which, funnily enough, is the unofficial Oceanic server).
---
hahaha ok cool, definitely adds to the appeal of the nelf possibility
---
Let‚Äôs not forget that the linkedin millenials you‚Äôre talking about here have serious loose cash
---
He looks happy
---
Saved for later
---
Most likely that pretty much every guild that isn't actively recruiting pre-launch and is mostly casual will be absolutely fine with whatever spec.  There's going to be a bigger demand to fill spots than to hit optimal class representation I think.
---
Yo a guy can do whatever the fuck he wants in his own home
---
Oceania server time is completely borked and thinks it's 3AM.  God I missed old wow.
---
To kill horde is to do mother nature a favor.
---
I made lots of enemies on 4chan and they tend to follow me around the internet.
---
Same here
---
PvP. And yes it‚Äôs as confirmed as it could be without them making their characters. It‚Äôs not all but the list was pretty inclusive of everyone I recognize as a ‚Äústreamer‚Äù type streamer
---
1800 Player q on the Normal Realm! Helll yeah B)
---
one of a reasons why people hate on him I guess, they are just jelly he is living the gamer dream...
---
If a quest requires collecting or killing things (checklist quests) it should pop up when you get your first kill/collection toward the quest.
---
Just google the questions.  Or check the frequently asked questions. Your probably reasking questions that have been answered.
---
Quartz, Flyplatebuffs/ Tidy plates plssssssss
---
If the thread is deleted by a moderator or automoderator they typically include the reason.
---
Winterspring to Silithus
---
No not really, in case anyone was worried, the XP install is on a VM.
---
The monitor is a bit newer (~2007 1600x1200 20" Dell UltraSharp), but I couldn't find a VGA to DVI adapter to hook up my older 17" 1280x1024 display. The keyboard is a bit old (1986) but it's actually my everyday keyboard, the mouse is actually period correct being a ~2003 Microsoft Wheel Mouse 1.0.
---
I might run Classic WoW on a 4:3 display with that shitty mechanical mouse for the first few levels as a joke.
---
Where is the 1 million number coming from?
---
On private servers a LOT of quest items had 2-5 minute spawn timers and no dynamic timer.  You queued or everything turned to hell.  I've seen it many times in starting zones even with relatively few players.
---
It was deleted for being 'low effort'.
---
I know its surprising, but yes there are more than 3 languages spoken by humans.
---
I like him. He can calmly explain shit and talk about his opinions and also nerd rage like a boss.
---
Yeah probably jelly people. Or people who got indirectly affected by the shit people say he is responsible about.
---
Paint your hands blue and sort of hold them DBZ style for 2.5 seconds and push them forward. Your officially seeing everything leveling a mage has to offer.
---
Maybe include more information then.
---
When you retire, that keyboard will still be working.
---
I honestly can‚Äôt imagine consciously sitting in my own shit
---
I logged for Undead and some quests were really tough to get done with so many people. But then I just grouped with one other and that was enough to allow me to get passed that pretty easily. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
As long as you group launch day should be fine
---
What's the ping like? I'm in Melbourne and kinda hoping for under 100ms
---
MOOOM, BATHROOM!!!
---
-tries to include Norwegian flag motif in image
---
- ends up with flag of Thailand instead
---
&gt; fun is feeling in danger all the time while leveling up
---
So DO play on a PVP server... got it!
---
And both of them were at a disadvantage in AV.
---
^(This is torture)
---
Just take 4mg of loperamide (just over the counter anti-diarrhea pills) every 12 hours. You won't need to shit at all. Then you can rig a funnel or something to your junk to piss in. Much better than sitting in filth for a while.
---
I wouldn't bother personally, but there are better ways.

Interesting. Do you have any numbers to back this up with?

I ended up falling through the map that way one time. If I recall correctly I fell for a long time and then ended up being able to walk/swim around in the void. I can't remember if I was able to resurrect only for it to just happen again or if I couldn't resurrect at all. Logging out didn't fix it either.
---
Had to contact the mods to get them to fix me. Took ages for them to reply, missed the raid and just spent hours walking around under the continent. Could see my position on the map but nothing else. My memory on it is fuzzy but I think I was able to swim out to the whirlpool but then couldn't go any further.
---
You got phised bruh lmao
---
Time your basic question threads when the mods are sleeping so it get answers before it gets locked. ;)
---
this. casuals WILL ruin classic, mark my words. It already happened once.
---
We have to keep the classic way of thinking about this too. So I assume you‚Äôre not a child.. so you probably should go horde since children play alliance right. Who wants to play the good guys in a fantasy world
---
It's an oceanic server... unless you're on satellite you're going to be under 50ms.
---
Had ~20ms in Brisbane
---
plot twist, it‚Äôs you
---
You didn't say English.
---
Im too lazy to cook so I only eat once a day. It frees up a lot of time when you dont have to think about 3 times a day and fasting as many other benefits aswell.
---
All streamers should be on one server, like a containment zone for the mentally unstable. The server is one giant clusterfuck like a forsen pubg server. Its a beautiful chaotic shitstorm that would be fun to visit once in a while
---
You do realize there are PvE servers right?
---
its certainly better than seeing a group of people completely vanish just so you have your own special snowflake instance that nobody can bother. MMOs have lots of people, this isn't news. If you don't want to be around other people, go play a singleplayer game
---
You are the essence of this echo chamber. All your impressions of the game is a fine concentrate of the collective opinions you have read in this subs. Try to think for yourself instead of recycling what‚Äôs been said a thousand times.
---
Mine is working but it‚Äôs buggy. All the frames seem to be anchoring/sticking to the Player frames. It‚Äôs really annoying trying to move the frames around so you have to resort to manually inputting XY coordinates. I‚Äôm probably gonna disable it and try Shadowed Unit instead.
---

As the other commenter said, the owl is an overrated pet. The cat's DPS boost is superior since your pet shouldn't usually be tanking multiple mobs. Joana and other speed levelers have said as much.

He sent out a kickstarter update in June:
---
We are finally inside the Amazon machine. I've been busy with their customer service and parsing their Sellers Marketplace Interface. 
---
The short story: We are waiting for amazon to fully "receive" the inventory that arrived in May. When it becomes available, then I can upload the list of addresses for replacement Kickstarter rewards.
---
I can't upload a bulk order of replacement books until all my inventory is "received." This happens when the items in the Reserved column move to the Available column. Every day, a few more shift over. It's maddening slow exercise, like melting chocolate on a stove without burning it.
---
The long story:  I suspect one of the factors in delaying availability is because Kickstarter rewards aren't sold on Amazon, that I'm using a service called multi-channel fulfillment. Of course, none of Amazon's operators know for sure if this is true, they all say it's usually supposed to take 5 days (I've spent as many as 6 hours a day on the phone, trying figure this out). 
---
Amazon is so vast, there's just no simple way to understand how the seller marketplace works. Some of the functionality isn't apparent until you're actually using it, and only then do limitations and persnickety particulars surface. Several pages aren't even reachable through their normal UI! For instance, the only link to the webpage for uploading bulk orders is embedded in Amazon's help manual. Unreal, right? 
---
By fulfilling orders for my post-campaign store thewowdiary.com, Amazon automatically listed for sale The WoW Diary without my knowledge. My book appeared last week without any fanfare. Talk about a soft-launch, I didn't even know about it! De-listing it didn't work, it just appeared again.  
---
Oddly enough, I need to activate a Kindle seller account to sell the eBook or PDF. I'm waiting for them to approve of my new account before figuring out if I can sell a PDF on Amazon. For some reason they're fussy about PDFs. 
---
And wouldn't you just know it, Amazon will not deliver a bulk order of books to Canada. It's the darnedest thing. I don't even know if Canadians pay extra for import fees. If you see extra delivery charges (or unavailability) to the Amazon listing of The WoW Diary, please let me know in the comments below. I'll see what I can do to reduce the price by creating other Amazon accounts and shipping books to their overseas fulfillment centers.

But i attack people for no reason (for fun i like pvp) on alliance and have done since 2004.

Maybe you should play pve servers you can pretend its warmode off content and /pvp yourself to turn it on.

&gt;Alliance is going to suck so much because of PVP.
---
Literally everyone playing on PVE gives 0 shits.
---
Hey all. I'm going to play on the WoW: Classic server, and this will be my first time playing WoW. Yes, ever. I also have three friends who are joining as well and we plan to play together a lot, doing dungeon grouping and whatever else you can do. All four of us are new to the game. Also, we will not be doing any PvP. Joining a guild and/or raiding is a possibility but not on our early radar.
---
So, we're looking for some guidance on which classes/specs to pick. Should we just pick whatever sounds fun to us? Is pretty much any combo of characters viable for dungeon grouping in WoW? I don't think any of us care about how fast we get to max level or anything like that, but we don't want to have a group that's too weak to get anything done either. Our main experience with MMOs is EverQuest, where not every group combo is viable even for casual play. Is classic WoW like old-school EQ where every dungeon group absolutely must have specific roles filled, like tank and healer?
---
Any advice is appreciated, whether it's general info or specific recommendations on a four-person class/spec configuration. Thanks!

Better?  Sure.  The best?  Far from it.  You could increase spawn density or spawn times for the first few hours after launch for example.

I feel like this sub has some kind of kneejerk reaction to layering that makes everything else seem okay when it's really just a different kind of bad.  They look at anything anti-layering and go "oooh, player interaction".

All classic wow private servers are obviously toxic little thieves and Blizzard only released classic out of the goodness of their hearts.

Oh please, vanilla had rppvp servers along with multi language servers for our euro bros. Why wouldn't they be in classic? Blizzard was never going to make these changes without public outcry. That should never happen, if they truly want people to pay for the classic experience, it should be exactly the way it was or otherwise noted If not.The reason why Blizzard got to this point is this senseless dick riding with people worshipping this company like Apple and Steve jobs
---
20-30 male makes a lot of sense given thats the largest demographic of WoW players.

I'd be ok with saping him so much that the fan bois would have to keep him covered in aoe so he could do his stream

It worked out of the box for me, but quite a few quests seem to be missing/ not tracked (in Teldrassil). Would doing what you mentioned did that?

I wouldn't play if we got those shitty Retail graphics and animations.

Warrior leveling was very easy compared to pservers. Health regeneration was quick and I didn't lose rage that quickly.
---
However the warrior health regen is working correctly as mentioned in the not a bug list (idk about rage)
---
You might be used to the difficulty of pservers but maybe the higher level we get it will become more difficult
---
It's technically a different game so there is a different client.  Don't worry the file size is far smaller then retail WoW.
---
Even after all these years we still can‚Äôt look like that dwarf pally set.
---
Yes, use it on a good farming class, then make a new character and actually play the game as my main, a warrior. Nice to have to farming alt at level 60 I guess. Wouldn't feel to great about it at some point but fuck it.
---
Go into bnet, click the WoW drop down near the Play button and you'll have an option for Classic.
---
I think you're overstating the difficulty of those old dungeons, when I played way way way back then Dungeons hardly ever went bad unless none of us as been in there, picking groups and forming them was about knowing what each class is capable of and meeting the people playing the class.   
---
 I was there when gearscore came around and thought it was stupid then it's STILL stupid, you miss out on a lot of what truly made running dungeons and raids back then great. Even if the runs went "bad" it was still a mostly fun experience because when you clear it finally everyone is better for having been through it.
---
&gt; If you have any other memories of our realm I would love to hear them.
---
Man, if there's one thing I have, it's memories.  I have one of those weird memories that can't forget things, even if I try.
---
I was on Bloodhoof from the day WoW launched up until early 2006, when they allowed free server transfers to Eitrigg.  My time there, the #1 guild on the server was &lt;Fury of War&gt; on the Alliance side, but &lt;E Pluribus Unum&gt; was #2 overall, #1 on the Horde.  &lt;Dark Pact&gt; was another Horde raiding guild, and I spent a little time in that guild, but they were kinda fucked up with their loot distribution (which explained why they were the only guild actively recruiting Rogues).  I spent most of my time there in &lt;Phoenix Guards&gt; which while the guild was mostly trash that never got anything accomplished, I made a few good friends and a lot of good memories.  &lt;PG&gt; would get good players and they would get geared out and be ready to raid, but at any gives time we had like 20-25 people ready for raiding, and another 80 players just dicking around not making any progress.  In the time it took to get another half dozen players ready, we'd loose just as many players who got sick of waiting and upgraded to &lt;EPU&gt;.  
---
I left to Eitrigg once I got bored of never getting anything accomplished on Bloodhoof, but a lot of people stayed and eventually ended up moving to Area 52 when the second round of server transfers were announced.
---
Questie addon
---
I had zero issues commanding my imp to follow, stay, attack, and cast fireball during today's stress test. I was testing it a lot just to get a feel for the new key-binds I set, seemed very responsive.
---
Good luck matey! I hope it works out for you! :)
---
Are common first names fair game usually? I want to just use my first name but it wasn‚Äôt letting me on stress test. I assumed it was taken but just making sure
---
Yours sets should match your spec. If you're going mostly resto you can't be pre-raid bis with a HoJ and some hit gear.
---
It would seem to me a lot of this gear pulls in opposite directions. For example, HOJ (you're not going to get this for a LONG time most likely) is a melee dps trinket but you also have briarwood Reed.
---
You need to have multiple sets of gear for different activity. If you have one set that has a bit of everything, the end result is you're mediocre at everything.
---
 I would certainly advise you to pursue resto gear first. It's not that you can't get into groups but many will be reticent to accept enhancement or elemental, as they do not perform as well as primary DPS classes. Healer classes typically gear for their other specs either not at all or as off-specs when nobody else needs the item for their main spec.
---
And this is why guilds absolutely should bar all women.
---
No diggity.
---
Ah the feeling of getting a random buff from someone will never get old. Thank you to all the friendly people that do it, it makes it a hell of a lot better for us Warriors
---
I believe they are thinking about the 5 seconds from last cast mechanic. As in, mana won't regen until 5 seconds after your last cast. 
---
I think, anyway.
---
Must be the British server, never seen such an immaculate display of proper queueing
---
This comes off as a virtual tough guy comment mans
---
I wonder if it's an EU thing. I've definitely seen pandas tonight on NA.
---
Just don't save macros to character specific.
---
Quest Helper or something like it.  Cant recall what I used then. 
---
Joanas guide was pretty damn good for speed leveling at the time.
---
Mana regen in lower levels is pretty fast but as you level Up and get more mam√° it'll regen slower unless you get Spirit from gear.
---
Thats the biggest difference from pr√≠vate servers so far. The first levels are waaaay easier for both melees and casters, which makes sense as tutorial levels.
---
Yes, I would use it, but not at first, otherwise everyone would know.
---
I'd level my own character until the first raid team started forming and then I'd pop the boost to join them. 
---
This is assuming the boost works like Retail where it comes with bags, mount training, and a level-appropriate set of gear. If the boost was a naked level 60, I'd probably wait until my own level 60 had collected some BoE gear, extra bags, gold, etc to trade.
---
Since everyone is goofing, it sounds like bluh-mew
---
NAXX OUT
---
That's a fucking superior name. I'm gonna pitch that to my gang
---
IIRC the vanilla client did not show an addon button on login.  
---
I could be wrong though.
---
Someone mentioned [this](www.classicwowbuilds.com/bis) yesterday, so you might want to play around with it.
---
Forzkin
---
Because whenever you got mana regen items before they showed as "x amount of mana per 5 seconds"
---
I plan to roll opposite faction, not neccesarily to kill the streamer, but just because you get a ton of targets from the followers.
---
I've met some of the most disgusting and vile human beings from playing private servers for a few years.

This isn't good. Wth

Yeah it's working for me. Just removing everything but "Clique" from the top folder made it work perfectly
---

---
Ok, so I think I'm doing exactly what you're saying because [this](https://imgur.com/a/siZbdqT) is what my folder says for the "bettervendorprice" addon. But it still doesn't come up when I get to character select screen. The .toc file is there.
---
I even give warriors int since it will help with skill ups :3
---
They don't work. 50% of the time your urine will push them off. Trust me.
---
This issue about pservers being harder than actual classic is going to be an interesting one.  Can't wait to see how it plays out.
---
The argument can always be made that this is not REAL vanilla, it's still a frankenstein recreation like pservers.
---
But it is undoubtable that pservers likely overtuned content because the other errors they made in recreating the content made it too easy without buffing it a bit.
---
But then you've got the fact that armour and resistance values were wrong, and the boss parry chance was way too low on pservers, which will balance things totally differently than they were on pservers.
---
Gonna be a great debate to watch.
---
Texas calls it the DPS.
---
I was excited until I learned that meant Department of Public Safety and they couldn't join our Wailing Caverns group.
---
The game goes to some detail to include you in its world if you read quest text and some of the books that are lying around in various parts of the game.  You could fly through a Warcraft 3 campaign if you were really worried about it (and it would be worth it, I think, because it was a great game).
---
Yes. Unless the name shows up on one of the filter lists I linked above or the name is already taken by another character, you can use it.
---
http://theengineeringmanager.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/20111228.gif
---
Private servers should not be your reference point for how correct classic is.
---
I've played both sides, I usually switch each expansion.  No matter which banner I fly, PvP tends to favor my opponent.  I've come to learn that its has way more to do on organized groups that simply the faction.  If you want to succeed in PvP, especially world PvP, get a group together and communicate with them.
---
The reason you're getting steamrolled by the opposing faction in BfA is because on you are on a shard with a group of organized world PvPers that are causing their defeated opponents to either turn off war mode, or shard-hop to avoid them.  The sharding system isn't 100% to blame, but it definitely makes it easier for these situations to arise.
---
That can most definitely kill you, even on stimulants.
---
Over the years of playing on private servers, I've come into contact with some of the worst people I could've imagined. I play on the Icecrown server now, and there are assholes aplenty.
---
snaxx was wotlk
---
Depends. 
---
If you gonna go hardcore and try to get ahead of the mob then the first hours are crucial. Once you are ahead, its easy to keep It that way since you shouldn't have much competition.
---
But for the majority its probably more time efficient to wait a few Days for the players to spread around the world instead of bottleneck at starting zones.
---
Removed them completely, yes. There's no data, sadly.
---
Just go straight to the IV for hydration.

He's correctly thinking of mp5, but from memory it's actually replenished every 2.2 seconds or something like that.
---
I'm getting random aggro from mobs other players hit once and ran away type thing and I never touched. Saw someone else mention it on stream, anyone else notice that? It's easy to see in the mines
---
Someone never actually played vanilla.

This isn't a retail private server it's a recreation of what vanilla was actually like.

It's how it's supposed to be.

Some people eat their own shit. That doesn't mean anything.

It‚Äôs not the breed; it‚Äôs the breedERS. A well-bred pitbull is the goofiest derp you ever saw, and also very protective. And inbred pitbull, like any other dog, is a loaded gun. It‚Äôs just it‚Äôs ‚Äúcute‚Äù when it‚Äôs a chihuahua and it‚Äôs the end of humanity when it‚Äôs a pit.

The same reputation used to be stuck on Rottweilers and Doberman. When a dog gets a reputation as a killer, it attracts the assholes in droves which reinforces it, and the  it starts getting bred by the worst sort of breeder catering to those assholes and it becomes a vicious cycle.

Trying this when I get home. Will report back.

Oh the irony of calling modern day WoW too much of a themepark lol

Good news! It was announced recently.

Let the dude have his name lol

If we're doing items I'm 100% rolling on Wirt's Third Leg - PvP
---
There are like 2 servers to play on. It won't be this nuts at launch lol
---
Do stretches. Do exercise daily, preferably twice a day. Whenever you have downtime in game (flight path, zeppelin, etc) do something physical; solve a rubik's cube, doodle something, play an instrument, whatever, make something to eat.
---
And most importantly: When you do not feel like grinding, don't. Do something else and avoid the burnout!
---
If they're the correct size, they shouldn't come off easily.  You can also use extra adhesives to keep them on.  Something as simple as a StatLock adhesive wipe should do the trick to keep on a condom cath.

why choose to be shit at everything? just focus on being exceptional at one thing.

I think current best price for a 1-60 in less than 10 days is around 500-600, so with an instant 60, I could sell it for $700 easy.

Yaaayyyyy! Thank you!
---
As someone who wanted to start reading the lore a couple of months ago, hopefully I can give some sage advice: 
---
The chronicle books are good. I personally read volumes 1 &amp; 2 and I feel like I have a good understanding of the lore up to warcraft 3. (Volume 3 covers Warcraft 3 and on from what I‚Äôve gathered). There were 2 things I didn‚Äôt like about them though. 1. The was a lot of information pertaining to mists of pandaria, wotlk, burning crusade, etc. I didn‚Äôt mind some of it, since I like tbc and wotlk, but I definitely skipped over MoP stuff. 2. The retcons. 
---
A lot of the lore has ‚Äúchanged‚Äù over the years, and that makes it difficult to figure out what the lore was when world of Warcraft was first coming out. Since reading chronicles I‚Äôve read a few of the novels, started listening to some on audiobook, and playing through the Warcraft 1 &amp; 2 campaigns (they‚Äôre on GOG). If you‚Äôre interested in getting going chronologically I‚Äôd start with:
---
War of the ancients Trilogy 
---
Read the Warcraft 1 manual (pretty easy to find on google)
---
Then either read 
---
Rise of the horde (horde focused)
---
The last guardian (Alliance focused)
---
Or watch the cutscenes for or play Warcraft I 
---
read the manual for Warcraft II 
---
Then either play Warcraft II or read
---
Tides of darkness 
---
Beyond the dark portal 
---
Then there‚Äôs a few more novels between Warcraft 2 &amp; 3
---
Day of the dragon 
---
Lord of the clans
---
Of blood and honour 
---
Then after those everyone pretty much recommends playing Warcraft 3 for the story leading up to WoW. 
---
I hope this helps and I hope I‚Äôm not wrong on the timeline at all. As a Warcraft lore noob myself I did the best I could piecing together what happened and when in each novel.
---
Go find a booze, it will look even better.
---
Did they wipe the data from it?
---
Yeah, definitely. Boost a farming alt/profession mule and then level my main organically for the experience.
---
I was one of the youngest persons in my guild back in vanilla, I was 15. Now I'm 30.
---
Havn't matured a bit tho.
---
Just roll on an RP/RP-PVP server.
---
That's the branch for Private Servers, you want: https://github.com/Aviana/LunaUnitFrames
---
This question gets brought up a lot and the answer is the same everytime. It's just common sense man. 
---
* There is no way to reliably pick which servers will be "high pop" or "sucessful" before they're given a chance. 
---
* There is no way to know what the balance is going to be before anyone actually starts playing.
---
* There is no way of knowing which server streamers are going to pick unless they announce it.  
---
Just pick one and play like the rest of us. May the odds be ever in your favor.
---
Each capital has its highlights. I always thought thunderbluff was mesmerizing. Lately I've been enjoying Aerie Peak in Hinterlands
---
It sucks. We women are left out. I played the fuck out of classic WoW. Was in a hardcore raiding guild, and my only solution is sitting in a diaper full of my own urine.
---
PvP will get annoying after you get ganked 3 times in a row by multiple people on the other faction and can‚Äôt level where you wanna level.
---
Fuck that the most fun part of the game is leveling.
---
It is known.
---
Classic isn't even out yet and we already have alliance crying, nice!
---
So thunderfury was just a plate someone fuck up so bad it turn up like this and they just added particle effects?
---
Sorry not native english.
---
I really with the city council would have elected a better city planner/ architect regaurding logistics
---
For Atlasloot for example, where do you download it from? How do you install the addon?
---
I haven't played WoW since retail Vanilla and Vanilla pservers some months ago. Is there a guide for how to use addons in Classic?
---
Lazy Peon?  More like Tiny Peon!
---
Pretty much this, Alliance has such a COLOSSAL advantage for PvE that your average Alliance raider will likely have better gear and higher clear.
---
Gotta be fire spec for a burn like that
---
Imagine being in a BG with a streamer, WSG, and just holding the flag until the timer runs out lol, his viewers get cut in half, people log on just to /w rage lol.
---
Yeah, collective blacklisting will be somewhat effective but a true geiefer isn't really doing it to make friends.
---
it's not the size of your peon - it's how you use it

The Keyring was added in patch 1.11. It doesn't show up until you obtain your first key. The number of slots in the Keyring depends on your level:
---
* 4 slots - level 1 to 40
---
* 8 slots - level 41 to 50
---
* 12 slots - level 51 to 60
---
I remember being so happy when we got the keyring.

wtf lol

---
Yeah, Unfortunately the great London fire hasn't happened yet so fire codes arnt really a thing
---
That is an unpopular opinion, because I had to race change every UD character I had on retail because the new model and animations look fucking atrocious.  
---
In fact, literally every one of the new animations besides fringe examples like orc female are hot fucking garbage and way too cartoony even for WoW.
---
Very neat thank you
---
Asmon on stream is just an exaggerated version of himself, just like anyone who's hosting a show. He's not a fucking character like Dr. Disrespect or some shit.

Lol, it's people like you that make me smile :)

give helpful feedback or just don't respond...comments like this are making this subreddit miserable
---
Within a few months there will only be about 50k players in NA and another 50k in EU.
---
Any NYC guild based on PvE server?
---
His community are desperate for his attention.  
---
I do find his reaction to community pick videos to be funny. Keeps making fun of him being bald, or showing nuclear explosions.
---
nope.  I could prob do the math, but then I'd lose the excitement of trying it out.
---
Uh, ever heard of sharding?
---
I second this question. I noticed a few twitch addons now say BFA and Classic. Not sure how to tell if this will work until release though...
---
I wish that Twitch would make a standalone Vanilla tab.
---
Commenting to find later
---
Is this copypasta worthy?
---
confirm not working
---
Group phases to group leader's layer. Been like that since it was a thing.
---
Alright I'm taking notes....
---
rename to what?
---
Delet this
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLyOj_QD4a4
---
Damn wonder who got Dragonmaw
---
For me, the people make the game so I'd  go with your PvE guild but that's just me. Maybe if possible continue the guild search to find a better match on PvP?
---
not sure if serious.
---
Ok, next step is delete your character, roll the other faction, and pwn them!
---
I'd use it, farm up gold buy selling grays, buy out all the extremely cheap mats that will get posted in the first few weeks, hold them for awhile, then sell at a super inflated amount. 
---
Never have to farm again for the duration.
---
Was in Vanilla too if I remember. If they died or ran and you are in aggro range.
---
Yeah, people who want the server community to be their streamer community.
---
I actually like some of these streamers but they are so fucking obtuse and in their own bubble about the streamer server thing that it really just makes me lose interest in them.
---
downloaded the 2.1 and unselecting nameplate health option doesn't save when restart client
---
Did you link multiple logins to the same bnet account?
---
That whole line was made of groups. People just like standing in a line in a game because it's funny.

Don't waste a pedal on hearth.  I know this is kind of a joke, but for real...this is awesome.
---
Lmao in the valley of trials it was a shit show, everyone bulked up around the names mobs
---
I doubt their massive egos will allow them to share a server since they'll want to be *the* streamer on the server. And perhaps have a second server for playing with other streamers.
---
Yup, it's like the people crying the most in general about getting ganked and pleading for help are inevitably in some spam guild called &lt;RED IS DEAD&gt;.
---
Because of 5 sec casting window.

What option is it in Questie that does this? I cant seem to find it.

This was common in FFXI.

This was on the RPPVP server lol not sure what else to tell ya also again its all jokes and for fun.

Hey Murk, looks like "WoW2 US" is a "Starter account."
---
I never remember using that or such a thing. So you were right I guess.
---
I'll just ignore it and stick to WoW1 US.
---
Can't i switch between shadow priest and healer priest pre-fight ? Or once i choose one im stuck with it ?
---
Space for my ice block, last stand ...

I quit watching him when i realized how hypocritical he can be. He was ranting for so long about blizzard not listening to their playerbase, then turned around and locked his own subreddit because they were making fun of him for dying to a darksouls boss repeatedly.

For those who don‚Äôt want to have their debit card info on their account you can use game time. Game time is also sold at Walmart so there‚Äôs an option for those under 18 because the games rated T after all lol so you just have to be 13 to play and accept the terms and conditions, parental consent of course.
---
No, the one linked was from 2007, and wasn't actually that loaded even for its time.
---
Yeah that's rough. I do think a lot more guilds will pop up after release so more options could open up, but definitely a bit of a gamble with your schedule limitations.
---
You‚Äôre stuck with one. There‚Äôs no on the fly switching specs in classic. Shadow priests heal just fine though just leave shadow form. In general when I leveled my shadownpriest in vanilla they needed to outnumber me to kill me.
---
Help me smile or look back in utter disappointment?
---
No argument here, have got 3 of my own.
---
Still going strong after 30 years
---
Here's something to keep in mind about getting Ganked:
---
It almost doesn't matter what class you are. Because you will only get ganked by someone who knows then can kill you.
---
It will never be a fair fight. You're either getting ganked by someone 5 levels above you, or you're afk, or you have 2 mobs on you, or he have 3 people with him ... etc.
---
Being a Priest or not won't change much.
---
------------------------------------------------------
---
IM NOT SAYING you will die regardless of your class.
---
Im saying you will only get ganked by someone who can 100% kill you.
---
That's why no one tries to gank a Druid for example, no one can catch the cat.
---
Game time is to ad time without using your debit card for a subscription.
---
This is amazing
---
If you have a sub, you'll have access up to Legion and Classic is included.
---
Honestly becoming popular as a streamer seems to be 98% luck.
---
You download an addon.
---
Hah, next thing you know valve announces HL3 on index.
---
SWToR trailers called , said lul.
---
Those trailers are better than some SW movies.
---
Just sub. I don't have any of the expansions past WoTLK and I'm able to download and play beta.
---
Will i still be wanted as a healer on dungeons being a shadow priest or nah ?
---
For classic, its basically voice chat for you and you bnet buddies. That's about it really.
---
Lol, I hope others get this
---
Forgot to take your autism pills?
---
**Looking For:** late night raiding guild - available Sun-Thu 10 PM-2 AM EST/7-11 PST (Not reliably available for raids outside of these times) 
---
**Server:** Very strong preference for PvE
---
**Faction:** Strong preference for Horde, will consider Alliance if no Horde guilds meet my time slot needs
---
**Class:** Shaman, Priest, or Mage
---
**Experience: ** started playing 2016, started raiding casually in Kara, hardcore raiding late BC/most of WotLK, semi-hardcore raiding off and on since (most recently at launch of BfA). Majority of my raid experience is as healer but I have done tank and DPS as well.
---
just commercialism, not correctness
---
Well it existed in TBC and then on and off throughout WoW never really getting much traction. People just prefer 3rd party solutions (fotm is Discord).
---
So if I go to Battle.net right now and just buy a subscription, it should let me download Classic WoW, correct? (I do not have a current subscription.)
---
Play on both and gradually gravitate to the one that you find more fun
---
man, there is literally 0 chance he gets that name now.
---
why do you have the users that reported on the addons and not links to the actual addons?   
---
Seems pretty useless
---
Yep.
---
Do what makes the experience feel rewarding
---
Stand up and walk every hour or so.  Even if it's just a couple minutes.  Too many people die of blood clots from sitting for extremely extended durations.
---
It's like finding recipes. No, I don't need a short story about how your hubby was wrangling wild boars while you made this salsa you basic bitch
---
if you're unable to get it to work, message them. Also I like to credit them as well.
---
Good
---
I love this mod. Will be using it for my entire leveling.
---
Fun times. My friends and i pooled gold and created the first guild on the BlowMeiux server. Claimed server first Hogger and had over 300 people join
---
So ready for classic
---
Thanks so much!!
---
im just here for the upvotes.
---
Honestly is why my fav you tube channel is primitive technology.  He never talks just does the work. I wish all youtube would cut all the crap out like they do in their videos.
---
Thanks god I am an EU player so I can avoid all those big streamers easilyüòÉüòé
---
because for me leveling is the least enjoyable part of the game, I'm all about the end game and I wanna get there ASAP.

Uhh.. this is flat wrong. I‚Äôve not seen anyone on /r/toolband compare it to APC

I've only ever played rogue in wotlk and legion so a warrior is very new to me.

Glad it's straightforward to spec. Thanks a bunch!

No problem! Enjoy!
---
Confirmed no separate section in the launcher. :(

no

Chuck Norris was once strolling through the mountains on what humans would call a "gruelling, nigh impossible hike" when he came across a convent of nuns starving from the winter cold. Chuck let out a masculine roar, and the wildlife in the surrounding area approached the convent and lay down, all scared to death by Chuck's booming voice. The nuns had plenty of food, but were so turned on they all had an orgy with Chuck.
---
The resulting pregnancies would later grow into men (all men of course, it's Chuck) of astounding calibre, we know them as the members of the 1972 Miami Dolphins, who went 14-0 in the regular season and then won their way to Super Bowl rings finishing 17-0.
---
You should see my velociraptor.  Seriously, he reads bed time stories to my kids and fetches me beer.  I don't understand the stigma, it's all in how you raise them.
---
Mine is more thorough so that any class could complete it. The detailed level estimation represents the average level I was at that point during my runs which tells you whether skipping specific content that's crowded/time consuming might potentially backfire. The routes also assumes you play on a PVP server and staggers contested zones until you're at a significantly higher level than most other players there.
---
What route you think is best is entirely subjective, but what I can say for certain is that I haven't "marketed" my service even remotely outside of the few feedback threads. The efficiency of Joana's guides are somewhat irrelevant because of name recognition alone, and guides like Zygors tend to market their existence everywhere. Who knows, being less known might be a net positive for users.
---
Small discrepancies in efficiency between guides end up being completely insignificant during the week long marathon of leveling. You should use the guide with the best format for your needs.
---
What the actual fuck
---
I used this for the stress test today as NE Hunter (completed it 1-12). It was extremely useful as I've hardly touched the NE starting zone in the past. I noticed a couple of minor things like some map markers being in the wrong spot or some small steps that were missing (but obvious enough to figure it out anyway), but the format makes it so much nicer than any other guide I've tried.
---
I will definitely be using this for launch; very excited for the rest of the guide (darkshore to 60) to be added. Thanks for the hard work.
---
Look at all those sheep out for slaughter. Howmany times will we die before we make it to "end game"? Cant wait to play.
---
Anyone typing Mankrik instead of Mankirk in this thread is a faker.
---
Don‚Äôt know man, it awoke the same feelings for me.
---
5 second rule is 100% working, this is incorrect
---
What goes into making a keycap like this?
---
And what if streamers actually want that and motivate their fans to do it?
---
When I fired up the stress test a couple hours ago, I got the strongest hit of nostalgia I've felt in my history of gaming. 
---
You won't get that, since you'll be new to the vanilla version of the game, but what you will get is the best version of the game. If you think you'll enjoy a slow, steady climb, watching your character improve and making some online friends along the way, then I think you've every reason to take a chance on Classic and then decide for yourself.
---
I think it probably appeals to you on dome level, or you wouldn't have found your way here.
---
Let me reccomend a PvP server, if you want the full experience. Yes, ganking will happen, but more importantly you'll have the chance to develop rivalries. Some of my fondest memories from WoW are of run ins with Horde who wanted to take my scalp. Sometimes they get it, and sometimes they "get it."
---
In any case, I hope to see you in there. Light be with you.
---
The instrumentals are classic Tool, and sounded similar to existing tracks. The vocals were all over the place, but definitely reminded me of the latest APC and weren't what I've come to expect from Tool.
---
I didn't hate it but I'm not sold on it either. But I have a bit of a history of not liking singles - maybe I'll love the rest of the album.
---
Questie seems to work.
---
That's Soda.  He is a top shelf shitbird these days with a gambling problem.
---
yeah i couldnt even get questie to work at all
---
me and a friend joined a raid of level 1-10 alliance players to invade durotar, it was so funny going through duskwood and the dread STV until we got to the boat, then we finally walked around durotar killing hordies and camped the valley of trials , but since they were weak we decided to move to the gates of ogrimmar. It was late so no one was there, we finished our journy at the crossroads after killing some warlocks and getting slaughtered by guards.

Interesting. Do you have a link for any such info? My guild is going PVP but trying to avoid the big streamers. If they are all going one PVP server, we just gotta discover what one that is so we can avoid it.
---
Back in vanilla I made a paladin on an RP server named Davis. Leveled him to 9, then decided he was foolhardy and impatient to get to fighting more serious enemies. So Davis ran north into Redridge and then on up into the burning steppes, where he was promptly killed by a giant tarantula. I did whatever it was you did in those days where you logged out and your corpse would stay there with your name. Davis is still standing there as a ghost on the character screen and I've never logged in on him again. I have no idea how long his level 9 corpse lay somewhere in the burning steppes but I hope it stayed for a bit anyways.
---
Worked for me...
---
You're a monster and I love it
---
The best resource right now specifically for Classic is https://willitclassic.com/ go to their Addon List and use the search bar or just browse. When you find one you want, go to one of the websites it is hosted on (Curse Forge, WOWi, "website", or github), and download the zip file. 
---
You'll have to use something like WinRAR (free program, find it through google) to open the zip file, and Extract To your addons folder. That folder is found at C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft\_classic_\Interface\AddOns
---
And what if the streamer encourage the community to do what they do? Good publicity, good money.
---
This is just sad.
---
I was wondering about this too. I have my named account and then WoW1 (US) right under it and don't understand the difference.
---
This literally caused a small amount of drama at Blizzard when the suits refused to call the new caf Snaxxramas.
---
Snaxxramas still best.
---
If they do I'll be fucking pissed.
---
Saved for the 27th
---
PvE in your own timezone.

No streamer will actually enjoy the game unless they play off stream like sodapoppin.
---
Hey! Fellow Warsong player! WotLK though.
---
Toss me one as well, sounds like a great resource.
---
We have two dogs here, one is tiny and adorable but loves biting, and the other one is a big fluffy "scary" husky mix (I dont personally know much about dog breeds, its some kind of mix) that is scared of everything and very well behaved.
---
It's cute when the tiny dog yaps and bites you because it doesn't hurt.
---
But when big dog so much as looks at you with a pant its "dont let that thing near me"
---
We are of course teaching little miss bitey to stop that, but a neighbor literally threatened to shoot our big dog with a shotgun if he got near her house. I call bluff but I've seen the shotgun so 0 risks will be taken
---
At least tiny dog can do no evil, right? &gt;.&gt;
---
I ain't much of a dog lover personally, but I hate seeing pitbull discrimination, they ARE lovely pets, and are extremely protective. It sucks that the perception of them has gone down so much thanks to dog fighters
---
Idiots, a true racer sets his rig in the tub and just waffle stomps shit down the drain and pisses in the tub with 0 clean up required except running the water. Git gud
---
So that's around 14 full sized NA realms and 14 full sized EU realms.
---
Seems like a win to me?
---
Can confirm. Ex wife was trash af and she loves pits.
---
i would def rather grind then wait in that line
---
I remember the very first time someone buffed me with fort.  I thought they had attacked me because my health bar appeared to go down.  For the first few hours of the game I thought it was friendly fire pvp but i didn't know how to attack other people.
---
Shame because I'd love to be a serial killer of gnomes and night elf strippers
---
Yes, but unless your guild uses DKP and you show up to every raid you'll probably not be a high priority for loot. As long as you are okay with that I promise you'll have no problems finding a guild. Shaman are always in demand.
---
I'll definitely recommend this to all my friends. Cheers mate.

QuestXP isn't working for me (both with and without QuestLogEx)

Not entirely true pvp in this game doesn't really penalize dying so people will get bored and take fights they might lose.  Though best to wait for them to pull some mobs.
---
doing the lords work. send them back to retail where they belong
---
I tried to buy Bleeding Hollow on eBay when they were listed but I didn't have enough money
---
Orcs got that passive axe skill but 1h swords can come from quests, wingblade to the bfd one, to sword of omen from sm, and finnally thrash blade. Swords easier to find honestly
---
I was able to install classic with no sub
---
I don't think he's talking about that skill. I think he means the extra mana regeneration when you kill a mob.
---
Niccccccce
---
Yeah go for the PVE server, PVP isn't so great when you can't play as much, it gets pretty frustrating instead.
---
It's a pretty good book and a very interesting look into the development of WoW.  Most surprising thing to me was how close they were always close (or thinking they were close) to just tanking.  When WoW was released (and I was there on launch day) it seemed super polished.  But from the dev side (as I read it, in the book) there was a lot of nervousness.
---
Yes, you can.
---
autocuck
---
I 100% agree. My brother has autism and he is the same. Not trying to be mean, its great all that he has done for himself :)
---
&gt; they ARE lovely pets, and are extremely protective
---
Extremely protective becomes a problem with children having friends over.  All it takes is one wrong move by a the non-family member and the pitty is going to tear them to shreds to protect the pack.
---
I am probably going to get downvoted for this opinion, but as someone who's gonna play casual I wish I could play on a streamer realm (I'm from EU, can't really do so). I am not going for min/maxing and I'm not going for world first 60. Their followers are not really the problem for me. 
---
I want to be on their server because they do an excellent job at massive community events. Different tournaments, massive pvp battles and other activities. Am I really the only one who finds this cool ? Even yesterday's event of Asmon where he brought hundreds of alliance to durotar. This was fucking cool for both alliance and the horde. Objectively speaking this is a great deal of fun outside of your normal wow classic activities.
---
Not planning to streamsnipe or anything, but participation in such events sounds exciting to me.

A cutlass is a type of sword.

They were told to just re-use an existing item and add a new texture to make it look unique. Instead they went above &amp; beyond to make it something special.

I saw Dendrax yelling around ironforge earlier lol man I love this game

Messed around with it a bit and couldn't get the nameplates to load. Are you doing anything special?
---
Yeah it seemed really dark to me too! I wonder why
---
I just downloaded the one from Twitch. I dont remeber the version, sorry
---
You guys know how to get me emotional.
---
The ingredients for the things you make to level up more or less keep pace with your profession. 
---
For example, to make a high level engineering item you would need resources that can only be found in high level arena. 
---
You can‚Äôt make a low level alt and run around beginner zones collecting resources to progress your higher level professions if that makes sense.
---
I heard Peter Jackson is gonna shoot a movie trilogy based on this story...

Oh, okay. That's good to know.

Unfortunately no, one-time-use or otherwise temporary keys don't fit the Keyring in Classic, only permanent ones will.

I saw a player in-game with a mini-Diablo pet and another with a little panda so it's working at least for some. This was on the NA / Normal stress realm.
---
I cant get enemy cast bar addons to work.. tried ecastbar and classic cast bar.  Options for both work but dont actually show when target casts.  Anyone had same issue or resloved?
---
This route json broke for me today 8/8/2019 on the stress test. I ran it through a linter and still had the same issues. 
---
I quite enjoyed using this format through vanilla-questing.me
---
If you are still around here I'd love to work with you to figure out what broke this!
---
Thanks again for this! Real life saver!
---
Are you on the alpha build? That is the one combatable with classic. the default dl option is for the beta build.
---
Starting your meth binge on launch day is a rookie move, you should be at least 24 hours deep when the servers go live

Today is a one day stress test only.

It's playable up to level 15, but it's running as smooth as butter right now, apart from a couple of server outages to stress test the login system.

Are you going to imply that all streamers are professional actors now? Off yer meds bud?
---
Shadow people
---
Can confirm.  Running well in Mint 19 via Lutris and DXVK.  You can add Gamemode to it as well for more performance.  See guide below.  It yielded about 15 frames per second for me average in classic from my early tests today.

Yep, leveling process is just a bump in the road for what I want so I'd skip it. 
---
Or I'd sell the account and level myself since leveling isn't that bad.
---
Just min/maxing that night elf racial.
---
Make no mistake, there's nothing involuntary about perceiving a girlfriend as a nonexistent obstacle.
---
If it's any consolation I don't look down on people as 'bus wankers' when I'm driving my car.  I actually miss those days when I could tune out while commuting to college/work on the bus.
---
Ahh gotcha, I was confused as do if it meant just by himself lol. TY
---
There's a classic channel on https://discord.gg/aXzXcs
---
The number of people naked dancing in Pornshire is disappointing. It's weird that people are actually playing during the stress test, because progress.

Thank you for resolving this!! I can‚Äôt sleep easy tonight knowing that asmon is legitimately retarded :)

Or you could just google it for him and earn that sweet karma instead of being a douche.

I heard Friday 3 PM or late night Friday, not sure though.
---
Lol alliance had lines? Us savages on horde just huddled around the spawn 60 deep.
---
im pretty sure if your last message was a whisper to someone, and  you then go to type something again it'll default to your last whisper, if the last messaged you typed was a /p message it should default to /p?
---
I don't think this is right. I distinctly remember padding meters with a prayer of healing after buffing fort.
---
Aesthetics are importanter
---
Absolutely nothing. It only works if the item in particular is either wholly owned by the player or it‚Äôs a rare item.
---
You need to update your battle.net app
---
soni said last night that all the horde pvp streamers intend to roll on the same server
---
Nice info. I was personally getting 60 frames no prob tho
---
Considering those races are on opposite factions you should first ask yourself what faction do you want to play.
---
On the official forums they stated that they would post the rules soon. I would hope they have this before the name reservations.
---
Sounds like a hoot, but only if you guys were joining the RP-PVP server.
---
No they are still the Forsaken, there's just more Undead factions now than the Scourge and Forsaken. Like the Knights of the Ebon Blade, the Death Knight faction.
---
thanks.....  :(
---
Thanks :)
---
Well my favorite looking race is night elf so alliance
---
Yeah it does. When you install classic with lutris, it installs the bnet launcher and then you just install classic from the launcher
---

What about ModUI?

I'm not here to farm karma and I told him exactly where that information is available. Its much more beneficial to him because then he can find that information anytime.

Even worse

Ty. I hated the box on the bottom right taking up space for nothing
---
Racism isnt cool
---
That‚Äôs my thought - I can justify a lot when it comes to books... but I just sounds cost prohibitive to even pickup because I‚Äôm in Canada.
---
No problemo I hate reddit trolls.
---
Looks like you answered your own question
---
Only custom stuff I approve
---
Yeah, that's what it's doing, but other servers were not like that. It's very annoying to have to type /p after whispering someone, especially in raids, rather than just have it to default to party or raid chat and having to hit "r" to respond to a whisper.
---
This guy healthcares
---
You are given them too much credit. Adults can be whiny and immature as well.
---
Guess so just wanted to know if races were a major factor or not
---
I loved the pvp game mode with the ball that you had to hold for longer than the other team. That game did a lot right but overall it flopped. It missed the bigger picture. Spot on review John Stamos‚Äôs Swedish cousin Yohn.
---
You guys are probably sick of hearing me but I played a twink orc shaman at lvl 29. Ive personally have been weighing these 3 for classic. The more I watch and learn and think about it I kind of feel like berserker is more powerful, ive also read that it takes mana but no GCD, where orc is no mana but a GCD. A huge portion of shaman spells and utilities are instacasts so GCDs matter, and i sure dont want an extra one.
---
Think, would you rather have a stat you can count on like getting quick heal off or being able to get your burst off quicker to end a fight? After all you have to do damage to win a fight, if you are elemental you'll be casting so faster = more damage. Melderon or caperfin tested berserking to be at 43% haste at 40% hp. Thats damn near 50% faster for 10 sec, seems like a lot of spells/dam could go out in that time to heal up or swing a fight.
---
 All the good videos ive watched the shamans will cast a heal or two between 75%-50% hp, so they actually stay fairly well topped off before getting back after the damage. If you're always topped off a stun wont mean death. Sure you'll have to reset and heal up a bit if youre stunned and take some damage. Sounds like a good time post-stun to pop berserker to get 2 LHWs off followed up by ES( interrupting their crap) followed by a LB then a CL all within 10 sec. 
---
Bloodfury does 25% increase but reduces healing by 50%, if you pop that its probably not worth healing yourself. Sure if you're ahead in a fight it wont matter and you'll stomp em out. But if you're behind and you pop that you better bring the damage cause youre not healing up and resetting the fight, I watch countless good pvp shaman reset like that if they take a little damage. Wish I knew the numbers but lets say your LB hits for 1000, with BF up it hits for 1250 how many 1250 LBs with BF including GCDs can you get off in 15sec vs how many 1000 Berserking LBs you can get off with GCDs in 10sec @43% haste?
---
Now the stun resist, 25% is awesome. I watch people get the resist and wreck face, if your main stun misses you're most likely gonna get wrecked. I feel like people save stuns when they are either finishing someone off ftw, resetting a bad fight or opening on someone. If they're finishing you off with a stun you're probably behind and dead anyway. If they're resetting they are behind and will probably lose anyway. If they open on you and you resist you surprise the hell outta them and whoop their ass. To me fate is partially sealed based on the circumstances of the fight, not based on the 25% chance to miss a stun. Remember it is also a 75% chance to not resist the stun as one redditor put it.
---
In all fairness I want to roll a troll in classic mainly for their uniqueness but I also want it to be for an unknown advantage.
---
I've played in guilds with large streamers and the most noticeable it's ever been was when they wanted help doing world quests because they were getting sniped by a group of rogues or when someone whispers you asking how to play your spec because they saw you on a dps meter. If you go out of your way to be around them then you'll notice them of course, but you'd be surprised how little impact most of them have when they aren't actively trying to have an impact.
---
Analthex woulda been way funnier anyways
---
Great, now they can remove layering.
---
Hey hell I hope your not all doing this, but this seems very extreme like a marathon and I just wanted to show apprection for his passion.

There is a difference between pirating a movie from a multi billion dollar movie studio and then a book self-published by this guy.

People like you who are so fucking entitled and just want everything for free are just the fucking worst.

Yeah I'm noticing that certain aggressive mobs like wolves will randomly start running around in an area, instead of walking.

You definitely don‚Äôt need it.   It may help, but your time might be more valuable. I assume many many many people will be leveling with mining and skinning and herbalism to make some extra cash.  I expect a huge amount of these items to be on the AH and probably sell only a little over vendor price.   So if you have a good source of gold it may be better to just buy your way.   Really just depends how you use/value your time.
---
I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs not nearly as laggy as some would suggest, but it contributes a measurable amount and is an easy optimisation. I don‚Äôt see them bringing it back but it would be nice. I used to love seeing skeletons littering the ground near difficult quest mob spawns.
---
Nah they are simply a rank 10 thinking they are good.
---
A rank 14 has friends that will take over their account and grind while they sleep.
---
Well human is best on alliance for pve due to the higher sword skill really play the race you want racials are a small part of a much bigger picture. In the end you have to look at the character nobody else.
---
No they are not available yet
---
Then add in a life-saver straw so you can drink it when it gets filled so you don't have to get up when you need a drink.

Ok thanks üëç

My gf gave me a high five cause she is my hand.

Who has Jaedenar? That was the launch server I played on. It was definitely the black sheep of the launch servers though lol
---
did you try taking out the -master in the name of the file? or extracting the correct file?
---
Yup, it works. I would use the same thing myself.
---
Actually it's it. Leeroy is a battle cry not a person.
---
The only way to win is if the guild masters girlfriend starts streaming then. Jokes aside, I for one can‚Äôt even imagine how someone figured it how to do this quest chain in the first place. I just watched a video on it and some of the things you have to figure out without quest markers is insane.

This is definitely not correct.
---
The people that win might be streamers but probably not. You'll probably need to be an officer or guild leader for a successful guild to grab it. It's mostly about having people willing to put in ours towards your cause.
---
Joke....
---
Invite please
---
I believe griefing is against TOS. Just imagine having thousands of people report you for it rather than just one.
---
It's probably because it was a stress test. Hoping that 100ms or less will be normal post launch craze
---
Thank you for the research:)
---
May I ask what the name is like? (doesn't have to be the actual exact name if you don't want to share)
---
As in, is it a server name, your bnet username, some random name, or a name you chose?
---
I don't want to "commit" to a jank account by buying a subscription just to find out that I could have had a nicer account...
---
I would have killed for a 233ms latency back in 06

Thanks for making me realize the way you have fun in a video game is way superior to the way those guys have fun in the video game. Without looking at Reddit I was almost convinced that people have fun in different ways...
---
Lol yeah it‚Äôs quite insane! I‚Äôll be satisfied to clear content up to Naxx at least. I lived out in the country so AOL dial up was what I worked with in vanilla.. gonna be amazing being back there. Save travels friend!

From what I've heard dynamic spawn rates were created for large private server launches post vanilla.

At least that's what they claim on the classicast

PLEASE INV ME ASMON LAYER

Thanks for the genuine answer and not biting my head off :)

Appreciate it.
---
As long as you can make money you can buy mats. So probably making bags and stuff with tailoring sell them and get mats for engineering.
---
I always thought it was for vanilla/tbc, I definitely remember doing it around that time - I wouldn't bet my house you can in 1.12 though.
---
Thanks, for a second there I thought I was going crazy.
---
I can only play 10min on the weekend because of wife and kids will I be able to clear naxx and get rank 14
---
Not as far as I know. I think they'd still have to complete the full quest line.
---
any ideas for a name? Can you plug yourself yet?
---
I don't get this idol worshiping obsession people have with streamers....
---
r/forbiddensnacks
---
I do know about this addon but it only shows the healing done and target name next to my character, was really hoping to find a fix that shows the healing number on the character I heal....   
---
Might end up just resorting to it though if there's no fix.
---
No time, must get to 60 and pre-bis
---
Well yeah that‚Äôs what I mean, get as many people the head at first then go through the quest together. I guess the problem would come with getting enough rep for everyone though.
---
what?
---
Honestly, this is good for everyone and has zero impact on end game mobs and nodes (minerals and herbs). Let‚Äôs not kid ourselves no one wants to be sitting there for 2 hours trying to finish your first 3 quests.
---
I looted 3 bags before level 10. I might as well not play after that
---
Nah, the selfish people are tourists who wants to ruin classic.

---
i only tried questie, but it seemed to work perfectly as well. was a little weird to install if you've never used wine before, but once you locate the folder, just unzip it there like you would on windows
---
Yep, turns out I have to do that. If anyone can write me a custom Addon that auto-runs these two scripts, I will pay you $50.00 lol
---
The best part is that it's blizzlike!
---
Chuck Norris doesn't do push-ups, he pushes the world down.
---
If anyone can turn these two scripts into a macro, I will legit pay you to make it. Should be very easy by my research:
---
/script ChatTypeInfo.WHISPER.sticky = 0;
---
/script ChatTypeInfo.BN_WHISPER.sticky = 0;
---
I had 35-38ms the whole night..
---
It's been great. I'm almost at 15, gonna try to do RFC and WC.
---
Oh yes, great, take the minimum wage from one of the richest countries in the world because all the gold farmers live there.
---
It‚Äôs a stress test, they‚Äôre testing the system. What do you expect?
---
People asking this question truly are special.
---
Oh please, no one‚Äôs ever looking for DPS
---
how did you get it to work? all i get is errors
---
Imagine assuming we need wide mouth bottles.
---
That‚Äôs not layering...
---
Hi all, I finish work in 2 hours (aussie) - how much stress test time am I likely to get? I'm an addict looking for a hit, wondering if it's worth subbing for a few hours. Thanks.
---
Commenting to come back on launch day
---
Not working but desired:
---
- Healbot (continued)
---
- Bartender
---
I expect with ques and layering to not be seeing people layered in front of my face at all moments of the test that will be the final test
---
Best I got is it's a unique id I was able to attach back in the day similar to my handle here. Not sure if it was because it's my original account before some sort of conversion with b.net Accounts. Hope that helps
---
It‚Äôs possible! After the first person bangs the gong, anyone who is at he end of the quest chain has 10 hours to hit it too
---
Stress test is for 48 hours, so it‚Äôll finish Sunday morning for you.
---
OMG.  That cost you ... nothing.  That‚Äôs right, it‚Äôs a stress test.
---
As everyone else was saying, it's solid, I was getting 23 from Melbourne on my crap ADSL.
---
Could be he d/c or alt F4'd out 30 seconds ago and you just came across him at the point his character got disappeared. Can't be bg/summon obviously.   
---
That's not a zone border so unlikely it's layering unless they got accepted an invite to another layer at that second I guess.
---
any working rogue energy tick addons?
---
Happy cakeday!
---
anyone else not getting the "addon" button at the character screen?  Ive restarted the game several times, checked to make sure the Interface/AddOns folders are there (they are) and have my addons in there, yet still no button showing up
---
And I would have gotten away with it too if it hadn‚Äôt been for the blasted line!
---
Where did you find SUF??
---
Most people probably don't but you can be god damn sure I want to waste 4 hours of my life on getting 10 mobs
---
No /s like a real man
---
Where can I find this?
---
Oh and my wow 1 -4 keys came from the Warcraft movie promo. I don't recall being able to name the "licenses" when I redeemed them. RaF benefits were too good.

---
This sounds very much like they're not implementing dynamic respawns or making any changes.
---
It seems like spawns were bugged and they simply brought it back to the original 1.12 data.
---
If this it the case, then the OP is extremely misleading.
---
This is no changes. They're using 1.12 data, no "dynamic respawns."
---
The spawn timers were bugged and incorrect in the stress test and they now have fixed it.
---
Mad cow disease is back!
---
Horde are dicks on pvp servers. Got ganked on landing from flight paths when I made an alliance alt. As far as battlegrounds go horde tended to win in pug matches but would get stomped by alliance premades. I think pre mades are much more popular on the alliance side for battlegrounds
---
Is this confirmed to work in Classic? I know macros are different because it's back ported from BfA
---
It would be nice if there were a BfA/Classic filter based on the selected profile, but there is not :(
---
Also could not find AtlasLootClassic (it exists here [https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/atlaslootclassic](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/atlaslootclassic) and here [https://github.com/Hoizame/AtlasLootClassic](https://github.com/Hoizame/AtlasLootClassic)).
---
This is the best post I‚Äôve ever seen lol
---
Besides this quest and the named scorpion, it wasn't really that terrible. I got to lvl 6 in a little under 1.5 hrs
---
No absolutely not. It's a big bait to go mining for engineering. Engi is really cheap to skill up, and mining is slow as hell. Only level mining if you actually want to use it at 60.
---
What are you saying 10MB of minified JavaScript doesn't count as "one line of code"! That's ridiculous.
---
Based on the 1000000000 posts regarding character races, that are easily searchable, one would assume they are paramount in making a great character. In reality, they can impact certain classes more than others.
---
Pathetic. Shame I get associated with this kind of behaviour when I tell people that I play wow.

Give this a try:

https://drive.google.com/open?id=12c-9okC1zY0SxvnJsz0xvr8mGInU9UAT

It's just 4 lines of LUA:

    local script2 = "ChatTypeInfo.BN_WHISPER.sticky = 0;"
---
    RunScript(script1)
---
    RunScript(script2)
---
go here - https://addon.bool.no/
---
paste the scripts into body, download and test, might have to edit the .toc file within the addon folder to reflect Classic version, else "load out of date addons" should force it to run
---
actually interested to know if this works cos if it does it solves a few issues for me too lol

What is with that obnoxious noise youre making?
---
Im so confused how this made you so emotional that it pitched your voice up and down. "LayeherING-Geh... Fuck-KING BleizsAREDeh"
---
I‚Äôll give a slight pro tip.
---
If you have literally nothing at the moment, choose a old world spot (1-60, outlands, I wouldn‚Äôt suggest northrend usually, or anything past it except maybe Pandaria)
---
Look for transmog drop locations / farm spots.  
---
You can make a few hundred thousand gold with less then 6 hours farming, the slow part is selling it (depending on your server, it could take a day, it could take two weeks for specific ones) 
---
I did this at one point to open five accounts to have fun multiboxing, it ended up making me millions a day (though this is because I know WoW‚Äôs market still very well) so now classic is free for me.
---
If you just have ‚Äútime to kill‚Äù might be worth doing some of the above - or other methods - just to find your future fun. :)

Polymer clay and quality paint

Install addons manually. The Twitch client will discover them afterwards

---
Yes
---
You forgot the people complaint about 3rd party gear score and lfg add-ons that will be in the game within a week. The salty goodness of those tears will nourish me for awhile.
---
It does. You just have to select classic in the drop down then press update. Not many addon makers have used the right game version for their Classic addons though so not many of them shows up.
---
You did!  Any idea how to get combo points to show up?
---
Has health regeneration ouf of combat bin extremely increased since last test?!
---
I found that more than a few that say "classic ready" are in fact, not. Curseforge is bad about that. They throw the 1.12.1 addons in and call em all "Classic" I've tried quite a few today, what are you looking for?
---
that means the version for private servers, so you can ignore that part
---
Is it obsession or just maybe they enjoy a community where they can goof around with other people around a person, i agree that streamers cause situations on servers I personally wouldn‚Äôt want to play around.
---
But for other people it‚Äôs something extra in the game. Which doesn‚Äôt seem like a bad thing to me.
---
That‚Äôs so cool! I would love if he would do an AMA here
---
Are there any working Buff/Debuff Timers, specifically ones that show a clock or sweep of time remaining on your dots on an enemy? I can't find any that work, though I swear I saw them being used by Beta streamers.
---
Thanks for the help!
---
For some reason I can't get the client to identify any addons in my classic directory. any idea why this is?
---
Okay ill rephrase, Replace "you" with "your friend".
---
Also its a 26second clip that you linked i didnt really go out of my way to find it.
---
I'd do this myself but at work atm sorry bud
---
heh was gonna say, you were gonna be in for a rude awakening when you found out 32bit isnt supported so XP doesn't work
---
i figured mine out... i left my addons double foldered from the extract... make sure you take them out of the first folder they come in

Did you know which of the 4 you were getting?

I‚Äôm EU and the real Thex is I‚Äôm North America. I‚Äôd definitely try to save the name for the real Thex if I was over there.

He's correctly thinking of mp5 at the stress test lvl range?
---
So if I just collect cloth and then kept it on an alt and then I just  send it back after I got to 60?

Ratchet&gt;Booty Bay
---
Thanks deleting post then if it‚Äôs working.  I just didn‚Äôt see any.  Wasn‚Äôt sure
---
i dont know if i am emotional or sonething right now,but i almost cried xd
---
Its all fun and game until someone is frozen solid.
---
I skip those quests. Those are the people who will make it easier for me to get ahead.
---
No. As the dev's said it's closer than any pserver and pservers made things harder on purpose
---
yep that's what i usually do. Mail lasts on the alt char for 1 month, and another alt in your own mail, and you don't even have to log in just make the character and send it all.
---
Bgs arnt out for release either....
---
Nope. Catering to babies who want everything handed to them on a silver platter is what has ruined modern WoW and gaming in general. Good riddance.
---
So like I would get mining while leveling to help engi, then at 60 drop it and get tailoring?
---
Lul why tf woud u post your name ? Some asshole gonna take your name just for fun and u gonna pissd off af
---
I thought tuk and elv weren't being released until after launch?
---
Modern wow has always ran pretty well for me using Lutris and DXVK, but as soon as I joined a 10 or 25 man raid or any highly populated area the fps would take a BIG hit. So don't expect to raid 40 man on Linux unless you're looking for that legit vanilla 8fps experience.
---
Do you use Plays.tv? It's a bit buggy with Classic.

I'm enjoying this shitpost, but there is no way this is a diaperpost.
---
Yea I know but they were out the previous stress test so thats why I'm asking...
---
ye indeed.
---
If you want to level engineering as you level up, then yes.  If you want to level it at 60, then don't bother with mining, it's relatively cheap to level up on its own with AH mats.
---
I use Arch btw.
---
So vanilla actually had dynamic respawn!? Nice!
---
No just buy it. Leveling mining takes so many hours out of leveling it's not worth it when you can just farm a bit of gold to afford engi at 60. Go with skinning if anything.
---
Damn, had that exact same keyboard, and possibly mouse. Keyboard was acquired with a Data General green screen computer, don't recall specs. Mouse i think when we got a Packard Bell Pentium 75 with windows 95'   space cadet 3D pinball and that downhill skiing game, watch out for the yeti! 
---
Thanks for the memories.
---
Have a video on how you made? Have some for sale?
---
Please don't play with my feelings.
---
Ho my god! This guide is awesome!
---
I think i have everything here to help me in game.
---
I will definitely use it :D
---
And I will make the wallpaper so that I will not need to browse each tab.
---
You could also setup your pc at your toilet :)
---
Never been on a pserver, i just lost feeling of how slow it originally was after the massive increase in retail. But if it‚Äôs accurate then I‚Äôm not complaining :P
---
done
---
I was at 600-800 for all of classic and tbc.
---
The joys of playing from Aus.
---
233ms is fine
---
Well I‚Äôm planning on leveling engineering while I level, so should I just get mining then?
---
Nah it wasn't that bad back in vanilla. In vanilla, first zones were well populated, but the release test was a real mess, pop wise.
---
Yeah, thats one thing i wanted to test myself. With the fixed spawn rates, doing a quest like the named scorpion is fucking pointless if you cannot get it fast. If you sit there, lets say 5-10 minutes (and it could easily be 15m), you would get a 1-2 levels just by killing L1-L2 pigs that ppl RUN PAST because they dont need the piggy quest anymore.
---
How much time would it take out of leveling? Like I‚Äôm really just wanting to take my time leveling and not just rush to 60 too much.
---
I had the exact same experience as you. I was specifically testing it in preparation for the name reserve. My friends all got in first as I sat waiting for the servers to turn green.
---
Cartri the undead rogue. It was a pleasure boys. They would never have stopped us without the help of those pesky guards.

That's fucking hilarious

You‚Äôre thinking of Highlord Kruul. Kruul invaded cities during the Dark portal opening event. However it‚Äôs Kazzak shown in the screenshot, so it wasn‚Äôt part of the event.

Is that 1986 keyboard a PS/2 connector? Do computers even have those any more lol
---
&gt;shitpost

I see what you did there.

I had the same problem and tried it on all EU Servers. I asked in general a few times but got no response. Looks like an isolated EU thing.
---
It was a good question!
---
I used to park my troll on the bed at the top floor of the inn, it was safe from guards and so many newbies would come up there and get startled.

Is the stress test still open for NA?

Today's stress test was a very good surprise to me.
---
Not only the actual client runs a little better than classic 1.12 on private server in Bootcamp.
---
But the actual experience is better in MacOs than on Bootcamp.
---
Maybe it is due to MacOs having slightly different effect, I am not sure, but I will play in MacOs instead of Bootcamp after today. I went through the trouble to install Bootcamp specifically for wow classic.
---
I have the same spec (MBA 2017) with the HD6000.
---
My current configuration is the following in game: [https://imgur.com/tigyA1T](https://imgur.com/tigyA1T)
---
In the starting UD Area I am at: Macos  48-60 fps. / Bootcamp 30-45 fps.
---
In the starting Orc Area I am at: Macos 60fps constant so far. / Boot camp 30-40 fps.
---
This with 20-30 players + npc.
---
I don't know what is the reason for this, if there was a process maybe hindering wow or not in Windows, but my experience is definitely better in native MacOs.
---
It is nothing Fancy, but it will do the job at the beginning while fishing for a better pc down the road.
---
Got 26 paid days off at work each year. Did not book any vacation since we're saving up for our wedding/honeymoon next year. We still wanted a few weeks off during summer. So when Classic release date got announced, we took 2 weeks off around that time. Not gonna play 12+ hours each day, but we have 14 days to level at our leasure. Still selected "lvl 60 within 1 month" though, not planning on rushing anything in those 2 weeks.
---
Hyperbole confirmed!
---
Double-check the file directory matches your Battlenet settings. I found that my Battlenet directory changes didn't save until I logged out properly, so it kept loading the game from my hd instead of ssd.
---
Dynamic respawn was in vanilla.
---
Then in past stress test it was not enabled
---

Now we have a blue confirmation that its back in - and as it should be.

Not sure how title is misleading
---
This made me laugh
---
Any way to get the microbar to show up with it?
---
Vanilla is classic
---
There is gonna be a lot of people doing similar thing so should be able to get one from the AH for a few silvers
---
Why not a portable toilet? Like a chemical one, for real, you can just sit on the toilet behind your desk.......
---
Fair enough!
---
Going engineer for pvp, and tailoring by the time ZG rolls around.
---
Do you have a discord? I‚Äôd be interested!
---
Yeah, true. By that I meant old classic.
---
That‚Äôs my server!
---
Thank you!
---
NA? Would love to learn more
---
On a side note, the client performs really well. I logged in and there were easily 500(maybe even way more) players in the starter zone, I was running at 300-400fps. Sure people were teleporting a bit but you could still interact and kill mobs with less than half a sec delay.
---
Meanwhile ALL Nazjatar shards get a 10sec delay if the PvP event is active on just  one of the shards.
---
No, they don't have to make a mistake. If both play perfectly, the paladin wins. But both can punish mistakes of the other very hard, turning the fight into a very one-sided affair. The paladin does have more leeway though, as it's easier for the hunter to make a mistake, a mistake makes the fight much easier for the paladin and the paladin has enough leeway in the fight to wait for a mistake and gauge the oppossing players skill before engaging.
---
Dude, this is the exact definition of dynamic spawning and they're saying it WAS in vanilla.
---
Couldn't even install Battle.Net, and I had to dig around for a copy of Firefox that would work.
---
Yeah, been thinking the same. Thank you!
---
Your post has been automatically removed because you used a keyword which is reserved for the subreddit moderators.
---
Worked fine for me last night, so I suspect it‚Äôs somethings to do with your set-up.
---
Yeah my motherboard has a PS/2 port, it's not that old a Z170 board with an updated BIOS to run an i7-7700k.
---
AAP and questie don't work at all on stress test, even using the willitwork website. EZJunk shows vendor values, will see if it works for selling here in a sec.
---
Everyone was lazy as fuck on my server back in the day. I remember a single mage farming silithids for months. She rocked the fuck out of the black tank mount though.
---
2 by level 6! In a party of 3! I guarantee that won‚Äôt happen again lol
---
If it's anything like the wowservers sub for private servers it should in theory be more active post-launch.
---
Just use a rubber band, that won‚Äôt damage anything right?
---
My guess is there still will be a few around for people scuffed enough not to pay for the monthly fee. 
---
But a thing i know is the most popular classic one will shut down when classic hits.
---
They're gonna host TBC
---
The point of classic is to experience the old game design philosophy and not to suffer through technical limitations from more than a decade ago.
---
I get mine to work except for an error that makes me not see party or raid frames...
---
Ok I'll bite his does the paladin gain enough movespeed to overtake the hunter with aspect of the pack on?
---
Have a similar addon list. Going with Details! instead of recount though, can't stand the look of recount.
---
I‚Äôve made more friends on this stress test than I did in the last three expansions.
---
They are saying dynamic respawns were indeed part of vanilla, and it also seems like a better system than what private servers offered.
---
With luck blizzard will be able to assert their IP rights and have them closed down. At that point they aren't good for anything anymore.
---
The nostalgia.
---
Play the WC3 campaign you're good to go
---
No mention of location, server, ping or anything. How do you expect us to be able to help you?
---
Cool! I've played on Bloodscalp as well! Kinda jelly of you
---
Most of the people who run them have learned to host them in countries that don‚Äôt honor IP rights, like Eastern Europe.
---
Just checked it against my auto-sell macro and it's the same code. Been using it since BC and it still works in retail.
---
New tool in 2019. didn‚Äòt expect that at all
---
Disagreed, vanilla (2004) and classic (2019), while based on the same content, have some clear differences
---
WEEE WOOOO GRAMMAR POLICE COME OUT WITH YOUR HANDS UP!!
---
It‚Äôs not old Classic. Vanilla was Vanilla, Classic is a faithful attempt at a recreation of Vanilla.
---
But Retail is full of QoL changes, and just weird additions that strayed from what the game used to be. Some people don‚Äôt enjoy that. Some do.
---
biggest active private server: "server shutdown in 15days"
---
dont worry all those bad criminal privat server people have a spark of honor
---
True as fuck. Doesn‚Äôt matter how many times in guild chat I‚Äôll ask if anyone wants to bg, run dungeons, anything. No response most of the time. Unless you‚Äôre in the guild ‚Äúclique‚Äù it‚Äôs pointless and sucks.
---
Posting to save
---
Can't find any either man, I've tried almost all of them. I'm gonna say wait it out, you'll find some soon after launch. Same with enemy cast bars, gonna have to wait until after launch for those ones
---
There is no escape for the Horde.
---
People and mobs vanishing is not the best route to reproduce classic realm atmosphere, but alas this is what we have now. The "name clashes" would be solved easily by having many servers in the same pool for possible future merge.
---
No, mine opinions are mine alone, just that they coincide with the majority here means absolutely nothing. Before Classic was announced I never had intention to play any Blizzard game, or pay for Retail WoW. There were Vanilla Private servers. Now I can play the "official" Vanilla. Of course I'm going to play it on [Battle.net](https://Battle.net).  
---
If Blizzard mess it up, I'm out, it's simple as that, I don't care if it seems like my opinion is affected by everyone else. I felt that way the moment I learned about Classic WoW and never read any other opinions.
---
I take it you missed the line earlier with the dwarves and gnomes then?
---
I have tried a few. None of them working.
---
Herbalism doesn‚Äôt appear to show in your general skills tab. Seems like you either didn‚Äôt learn it, one of your addons is blocking it, or a big bug that not many others are being affected by.
---
There are lots of people "looking" for people. I know I've seen a discord dropped for it. I'm fairly skeptical about 5 strangers guaranteeing the same attendance for a week or 2 to level only with dungeons but there are definitely people looking.
---
Come visit our Classic Warlock discord: https://discord.gg/Ykz42G
---
For me, the biggest detractor from using Wow's ingame voicechat is how, if the game acts up on you or you need to restart for some reason, or you leave and join groups throughout your playsession you'd lose voice comm as well.
---
Had same problem in Destiny 1 on PS3, your game crashes, you switch fireteam, no voice comm. Then when we all upgraded to PS4 we could use the more independent party chat and no more problems (unless your entire PS4 crashes, which hardly ever happens).
---
Pops on pservers are already going down the toilet, NA pops in particular. The international playerbase will still have hundreds to thousands of players scattered across a few projects, though.
---
afaik they open up classic servers on the 12'th or 13'th for char. creation to reserve names. However i fail to see the fun in stealing any others name just to be a troll
---
I don't know about the font, but in comparison, the first screenshot has the font misaligned. That's all I can say.
---
Yea homie, our numbers are small, we haven't been recruiting but we are taking people of all walks of life  and availability.   Yea we are NA 
---
https://discord.gg/htpCGP is our discord
---
Only played a little bit on pservers but no, switching between 2 static states isn't dynamic. In vanilla / classic you had the respawn rate and a trigger to spawn faster at a very specific rate.
---
This was explained well during vanilla and TBC.
---
Dynamic spawn rates adjust to the current situation in more than 2 static ways. It changes dynamicly depending on how many players, how fast the mobs die.
---
In the 90s, the current system in vanilla could be concidered dynamic but even then it'd be a stretch.
---
EZJunk sold perfectly last night in the stress test.
---
Some of them have a legit cult of personality.
---
There were "private" servers in 2005 when Vanilla was live.  Give it 6 months and there will be "private" servers running on the 1.13 client.
---
I think most are OK with being on a server with 20 tiny streamers as opposed to 1 streamer with 10k viewers.
---
I'm using all my names to hold thex on as many servers as possible.
---
Every pvper is equipped with such stuff. So what's your point? 
---
And if you talk about a conuter, you don't jsut assume best initial position for one class. Such situations are not the norm.
---
If the hunter can engage you from max distance with pack up and you unmounted, they are already in the advantagous position of ambushing you. so, wouldn't really call that a fair fight. Ambush gives hunter a big advantage, especially if they can get down trap without using feign death. When I can ride up and attack the hunter before they notice me, I'm in a very advantagous position as well, where the hunter is almost guaranteed to lose. So, I guess paladin is a pretty hard counter?
---
Yeah, I'm looking for something like this too.
---
Love, your dearest friend Mutted.
---
the quest itself isn't even that big of a deal.
---
it's the rep grind beforehand what kill's dream's and hope's.
---
those fucking bugs are elite and hit hard. you can solo them as hunter or mage but the rest needs at least 2 people and only one gets the rep. and since they drop nothing besides the rep stuff its a complete waist of time for everyone not getting the rep.
---
you need a solid friend/guild to accept it and help nonetheless. or an army of braindead teens on twitch

---
Thinking that this sub will become less active post launch when literally hundreds of thousands of players who don't visit this subreddit right now will start playing the game seems really delusional.
---
I like they did that. We all knew how to stop flight by relogging so this makes sence. Also, they added a OmniCC like feature in UI - it's actually good addition
---
&gt;So, I guess paladin is a pretty hard counter?
---
From everything you've said in your posts and my personal experience it's the exact opposite. Hunter just kites and the paladin just feels bad.
---
But where tho
---
Buddy, I said pass it not pontificate. Get outta here with these crazy ramblings.
---
Because vanilla did not have this much of a player base at launch or anytime soon after. That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt understand the hate for sharding. Several million logging in on day 1 was not the vanilla experience. Waiting for quest mobs surely was, but not in a line of 60 others at any given time
---
Are you a guidemaker?
---
If that is the gameplan then it lines up nicely, because by the time you craft the Greater Magic Wand, enchanting has served its purpose. If you picked up mining right then, you should be at a level in a zone where copper nodes are still plentiful.
---
According to my friend who played the stress test yesterday it was part of the base game. Maybe someone else can verify, as I won't pay for a subscription until classic launches.
---
People will come here to ask questions about the game, because it's faster than the official forums and you have a bit more freedom of speech.
---
You need to reread it, it *is* Dynamic Respawns, just like vanilla had.
---

---
Was this ever a question? Starting areas were always dynamically spawned on vanilla, it's hard to forget a pile of people running in circles killing the last mob and immediately moving onto the freshly spawned one ad infinum
---
I tried relaunching several times, but I never had a button at character creation to turn on the addons. Idk what I did wrong

Name checks out
---
Download them from any of the addon sites listed in the AddOn mega thread (on the front page of this sub).  Then configure them how you'd like, and make a backup of the interface/WTF folders in case a patch wipes your folders.
---
the problem would be that 1 guild that does not follow the "wait for others to catch up" and ruins it for everyone. Its a race, and i doubt there will be honesty enough for it to be treated like anything else but that.
---
Can you get different names for your imp by deleting and remaking your warlock?
---
You can but only people who are in the instance. I don‚Äôt think it would work in this case but a warlock could summon himself outside of an instance.
---
That's one misleading topic. Have a downvote.
---
Oh that's good to know, thanks. Pretty sure this summon  &gt; hearth trick won't woe though
---
You can always post links as a Performatted Text on Blizzard forums.

Tbc servers always die.
---
Hardly anyone will play them and most will shut down.

Repair bill for dying to another player, was that a thing in vanilla?
---
Warsong player here through BC. Which faction?
---
The idea of playing on a streamer server with all of the zergling followers acting like idiots 24/7 is the worst thing I could imagine so I will never roll a streamer server fuck that.
---
If you play NA, there are more streamers than there will be realms.
---
Enjoy.
---
Anyone find an addon like oPie? I've seen some Pserver footage with an addon like it, but idk if it's working in Classic. 
---
Also any good shaman addons working? Something to keep track of totems would be nice.

---
In regards to the bag addon and the threat meter, I found 2 addons that worked so far, OneBag3 and ClassicThreatMeter!

Used to have an add on for this years ago and loved it but have just played off and on since and haven‚Äôt felt like searching one out so I‚Äôve just been doing it manually, this is a fucking game changer thanks mate
---
Since there haven't been any TBC server comparable to the best Vanilla/Wotlk servers yet.
---
Will be interesting to see if Blizzard decides to proceed if Classic is succesful :)
---
when I hop on a private server hosted in the EU when I'm Central US and only get 100ms while getting 233ms on the Classic Stress Test Central US Server when I'm Central US.. that's not fine.. something is most definitely wrong
---
What Orexfs said, it's just one of the more complicated things to pick as a first timer, but you could be totally fine, depends how well you pick things up.
---
You don't really need to know too much about the lore but again like Orexfs said, play Warcraft 3 or watch the cutscenes on youtube.
---
Are there enough high profile EU streamers to crowd all EU servers?
---
The love the imp's name, I'm worried about playing a Warlock because my demons usually get lame names and i feel like rerolling :&lt; Too bad we can't rename them.

This just fucking sad.

Those servers were jokes though.   Decent private servers popped up when real vanilla wasnt an option nut any that stick around when the legit option is available will be trash.
---
Tidy Plates is working, you need both Tidy Plates and Tidy Plates: Classic. I got mine from Curse Forge.

It can definitely be an emotional thing, so no shame

Same, it was a bit laggy in the starting area but I think that's perfectly fine. BTW are the servers already down or do we have the rest of today to grind a bit?
---

after leveling in the starting zone today, I thought it was reasonable. If launch is similar I will be trilled.
---
&gt; I've never met someone in real life who also plays WoW
---
I have, several times. It doesn't matter if you haven't.
---
It's actually -classic instead of -master but yeah I tried to remove it but it still didn't show. What do you mean with extracting the correct file though? I extracted the .zip and put the whole dominos-classic folder in my addons folder, then removed the -classic.
---
I had to use the blizz key bind menu but got it working, just a bit more fiddly
---
I just invited a bunch of people who were also waiting for a quest mob so all 5 of is got the credit. Let people know in /say and others started creating groups too
---
I'm not surprised... WoW has taken too many lives, and half of them are permanently scarred man babies now.  The rest are just twitch kids.
---
2004 vanilla mainly had real adults and teens that knew how to read good enough to play a game like this, with no questionmarks on the map...
---
Now days it's just a monkey see monkey do internet culture... I use to be surprised how low iq some people could be... Not anymore... It's become far more common place.
---
It's been awesome to watch this sub slowly shut the fuck up about layering and leeway.

There is an option for every frame type to anchor it to another. You just have to turn it to "None".

I dont understand what you mean. on my twitch screen when i hit mods it brings up 14 diff games like rift and stardew including wow, but NOT wow classic. When i select wow it shows i have no addons and pressing get more addons puts up all the retail wow addons that it wants to install to my classic folder.  If i browse instead of all categories down for class or pvp etc, I still get retail add ons.
---
 Where do you get the classic addons? can you give a step by step idiot guide please?
---
If I remember rightly it was the version before the most recent one on Curse

I didnt get questie to work during the stress test.

Can you imagine, getting a raid together that runs in and throws 40 sappers on that pack. You would see damage numbers popping up next week.

Indeed.

Take that back, latest WoW Classic installer script works perfectly, I was trying a couple days ago with the retail WoW installation.

"Just a quick 30 minutes" turned into 6.5 hours. I'm lucky I have such an understanding wife.

---
Did you get keybinds to work? I couldn't click okay while setting then, and keybind menu was very limited.
---
And that‚Äôs why we want to avoid/kill (in-game) streamers.
---
Thumbstick wise, which did you prefer between the V2 and the Orbweaver?
---
I also used a n52te and really liked the d-pad but I heard the V2 has an issue with the switch breaking a lot and while the Orbweaver has its glue issue the thumbstick looks more reliable but appears to be different.
---
I think they will go down tonight at 20:00 CEST
---
1. Pretty sure apes are going EU and the streamers are going NA. 2. Pretty sure apes are themselves just some more aspiring streamers now. 3. Pretty sure apes didn't manage to run the beta by any means. Let's see what they can do in a Warden environment.
---
Don't listen to these soyboys, keep eating those crisps.
---
there is an option where you can deactivate the clock on the map
---
Yes, there are. A lot of hardcore groups are being made within guilds, but three are also pub groups posted on Hakurais discord.
---
Do you guys not have laptops?
---
And just for those naysayers who were against all forms of launch control mechanics and wanted Classic to launch "au naturel": without layering, this line would have been five times longer and this one quest would have taken 2+ hours to complete. Most quests would. Stop campaigning against the thing that's going to make Classic playable.
---
Yeah, this is not the classic experience at all. Bring on the mob-tagging frustration!
---
Amazing. Putting a comment to save this for later
---
Except Freezing Trap is useful for taming pets, especially if you try for the ghost saber at a lower level. I remember taming it on a private server a few months ago and Freezing Trap meant I almost didn't die instead of actually dying.

Yes, but 15 years ago loading screens were to long for most people to do this.

WoW wasn't around in the 90s, and pservers shouldn't even really be mentioned. I'm not sure where you are getting just 2 static spawn rates, since their post doesn't say that. Are you just assuming that's how it is?
---
You can do it at level 1, just rush it as soon as you log in

Man I leveled a warrior in vanilla and I feel like they might be one of the only classes where it gets easier. You get some abilities that give you a little bit of sustain and can get some decent gear and your rage generation is much better. 
---
I don‚Äôt remember perfectly obviously but I remember unlocking bloodthirst was an absolute godsend. 
---
The low levels as a warrior were awful until level 20 or so.
---
All you did was ignore what I said and pretend it's everyone elses fault those dogs started biting people and kids.
---
I've watched the guy on and off for a few years - I feel that ever since he got subs and his streams got packed with kids, he's exaggerating his manner of speaking etc more than usual.   
---
I can't stand that kind of stuff since it's obviously fake/forced to me. Used to love the guy's attitude and stories but these days I don't really watch anymore.
---
Hello,
---
very tough decision. I played MT Tank back in the days as Warrior. And switched to OT in BWL. My main focus is chill leveling with friends (3 man stack which level together &amp; 2 others for level 60 stuff) and later farming gear and raiding.
---
The 3 man stack is kinda flexible what classes go. One could play a shaman and heal. The other one wanted to DPS but would also play druid for tanking. The other 2 for lvl 60 stuff are both DPS (rogue &amp; mage/shadowpriest).
---
I am the third guy of the 3 man stack and i can't decide what to play.
---
First I thought about doing Tank as Druid (can't and won't play another Warrior). Leveling Druid is fine and tanking in 5 Man Groups are nice. But I have concerns playing druid to level 60 and getting a raid spot as "the worst healer in vanilla". You can't Main Tank as Druid, so Tank is out. Moonkin is instantly OoM so it's out. Cat DPS is very, very irretating with shapeshifting all the time for energy. So Leveling &amp; 5Man Group (gearing for raid) is fine, but the raiding itself is big time bad.
---
So Druid &amp; Warrior is out, because we play horde that's it with tanking in classic (i am cool with that).
---
I thought about player Healer myself, but my wife is set on Shaman and she don't mind to heal. So she will be Healer for 5-Man Groups and Leveling.
---
So DPS is an option. Which I kinda like to have this option. 
---
I lean towards Warlock &amp; Hunter:
---
both have Pets, but it's not my focus here. It's just I played Mage a long time in Retail. Warlock was always my hidden favorite. I leveled a Warlock on every expansion, but never get to raid with him, because I kinda got forced to play Tank or Heal. I loved Warlock back in the day (End of WoTLK) and leveled one in Classic as Twink. Leveling was chill. But dunno about Raiding and 5-Mans. Is the DPS decent? Do you have problems finding a Raidspot? Do you have to farm soulshards before raiding? (Soulsharding is a bummer).
---
And Hunter, I never played a Hunter in any game and would give it a go. But I am concerned about not getting Raidspots as a Hunter. Is hunter good? I actually don't know.
---
Right now I would pick a hunter. But there is still constant switching going on in my Head. Druid and be able to Tank? Warlock? Or the Hunter, something new which I never played ?
---
Man I wish I could find Malfurion's old server blade. I'd love to have that.
---
So, I installed chatter and it's working, but I can't for the life of me figure out how to access the options. I would assume /chatter but it doesn't seem to do anything ?
---
w00t
---
Greetings to Mcconnelret you actually will read all of this.
---
it‚Äôs not. you good bro, the problem is that you know what you‚Äôre talking about, and not everyone else does.
---
Fantastic, enjoy!
---
Tried few times more - no chest.
---
&gt;We're not playing vanilla for because we give a shit what happened to dunkirk's wife or whatever the fuck. We're playing for the world experience.
---
Who are "we"? There are probably a tons of RPers out there that give significant fucks about dunkirks wife.
---
happy cake day !
---
Ty for tip, none of my friends will play classic unfortunately so I went ahead and bought a sub on another account which I will only use for this purpose lol
---
They've ready lost tho. They can fuck off and cry about layering.
---
hotel: trivago
---
I spend like 40 hours in the beta easily, even though I just wanted to play a couple of hours and help find some bugs. I only stopped because I know progress gets wiped. Classic is still an amazing game with a unique atmosphere that you can't find in modern wow anymore. Of course I now know what the game is all about. But just doing quests, seeing the old areas, grouping up and talking with other players and getting first greens, blues, shoulderpads, bags, etc feels so good
---
Details! appears to be fully functional, but throws out a *lot* of LUA errors right now. I wouldn't use it until that gets resolved, personally.
---
Some people like jaggies I guess.
---
Man I don't know where u live in Swe but where I live people don't feel safe unless they are in a group. Blue line subway Stockholm btw. Fuck yourself for acting like people can't feel unsafe in Sweden. You must live on a farm or something. Totally blind to the problems. 50+ nogo zones btw, what a GREAT country.
---
nice to hear :)
---
You can skip all the quests in the starting zone if you want to. Just kill any mob that you can tag until level 5.
---
·∫ûssz
---
This is great. Give this man gold. Hero we don't deserve is a mere understatement
---
Amusingly it‚Äôs going well because they ARE using dynamic respawns.
---
But the main point I was discussing was the number of people in the pic - when I loaded in, there were easily 10x more
---
look at them normies standing in that line
---
It's also much easier to hold a conversation on voice hvem you can speak your own nativ languish, and with others who easier picks up your refrences. It also brings more people to the voice channels, this if we where force to speak english.
---
Did you reply to the wrong comment?
---
At the moment it's a complete crapshoot. Lots of misinformation or lack of information about what is and isn't updated, what is and isn't planned to be updated or ported to Classic. Lots of retail versions being reported as Classic versions. There's also just a lack of functional addons in general, though obviously there's quite a few out there already.
---
Give it another month, once Classic launches and people can properly test and develop addons it should settle down to a "normal" state like retail.
---
So, that is going to be the NA Rp-PvP server, right? XD
---
When will the stress test expire? Will I be able to play in about 6 hours?
---
People used to do same in Lineage 2 , when quest mob spawn was long
---
People need to stop mixing these terms. This is *not* dynamic respawning. This is a threshold which, once you go below it, mobs are instantly respawned. This means that the number of people in an area does not matter, only whether the amount falls below the threshold.
---
The dynamic spawning that people know of nowadays is one where the spawn rate is dynamically adjusted based on population. This means that the number of people in an area does matter.
---
In particular, as they said, these thresholds are not that aggressive at higher levels, which makes it so that farming with 10+ people in a high level area is *not* effective with these thresholds, but *would* be effective with dynamic respawns as this does not have any sort of "diminishing returns" based on level, amount or anything.
---
I'm having the same issue, if someone has any tip.
---
Go up mountain behind their last bunker
---
Is this stesstest if so how the hell he got that money??
---
Kevin Jordan confirmed dynamic respawns for early zones months ago in a twitch stream.
---
My brother ran an Opteron on a 940 in his gaming rig for years.
---
What are you talking about? I said in the beginning, this is a strategic matchup decided by players making mistakes. If both are equal average skill, it's an even matchup. The higher the skill gets, the more favored paladin becomes. That's been my stance since the beginning.
---
And my personal experience is, that hunters weren't a hard matchup for me 13-14 years ago in wow vanilla. That's a personal anecdote and I likely outgeared most of the hunters there, but it shows, that I didn't have trouble closing the gap despite not even having engineering in vanilla.
---
And your position is to constantly argue from a hunter with pack engaging an unmounted paladin from max range permakiting the paladin, who stupidly runs after them without any tools to close the gap, because those tools aren't class abilities and base hunter countering paladin off that. This is an incredibly favorable position for the hunter to start off with and is not the norm. You cannot assess a matchup based on the optimal engages for either class.
---
When I say, that a hunter getting such a favorable engage is a big advantage, you call me inconsistent for saying that, but continue to assume that this is the standard engage. When I say, that if the paladin gets the optimal engage, the hunter has no chance at all, you don't even respond to that.
---
And as I said, if the hunter gets the optimal engage, you constantly refer to, the paladin would be stupid to try to close the gap if they don't have a charge ability ready. Any paladin not completely stupid would in that case run away and los the hunter to reset the fight, as I've said twice before. So, you think I have no idea of the matchup while your assessment of the matchup is based on a very favourable position for the hunter vs a bad paladin player.
---
I also linked an in-depth video guide to the matchup in my first post today, which it seems you haven't bothered to check out. Here it is again: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjY3vSQWh54
---
Blizz confirmed that for this scenario names will be available immediately if deleted.  I don‚Äôt have source on me. Was in a recent blue post
---
Ok I guess ill just have to take your own made-up "knowledge" on this then as a reliable source instead of literally every other site or articles written by historians (not just wikipedia).
---
The respawns scale with population, that's dynamic respawn.
---
Brutal.
---
Sounds like you are in a situation similar to mine. I picked PvE, then you can PvP when you feel like it but won't risk getting your PvE too disrupted by bored grievers.
---
I am pretty sure this is not the case for level 1 characters
---
No it's not? What they're describing in the post is dynsmic respawn.
---
Does the base asking price show up as a bid (even though no-one has placed a bid)?
---
Luna Unit Frames is partially working. Many issues from moderate to minor. Two major issues that I‚Äôve seen are no Party Targets and no Target Cast Bar showing. 
---
Anyone know how/if/when we can get this up to date?
---
Could you elaborate more the last sentence? I've also considered priest, but like lilomag44 I'm concerned that I'll just end up like a bot outside group content.  
---
Can a healer priest really do that much in 1v1 against other classes same level?
---
The post confirms that there **will** be dynamic respawn, as it was in Vanilla. It existed in 1.12, but wasn't enabled in previous stress tests. They've enabled it this stress test so that spawns work how they did in 1.12.
---
Ermmmm... what?
---
These fast aoe dungeon groups trying to pull bigger packs and going through dungeons as fast as possible remind me of diablo 3 greater rift runs.
---
5 people leveling to 60 together this way seems almost an impossibility with unexpected real life surprises. Seems more logical to form a guild with 100+ people with a decent class mix ready to mix and match groups as needed. With this many people, there should be enough players and classes at every level/dungeon bracket. Maybe only half of the guild would actually be able to hit 60 with this method unless everyone is very dedicated. Could even recruit outside to fill certain rolls for a few hours if needed.
---
Doing it in groups is in everybody's interest since it shortens time spent in queue by 5 times.
---
Top incel comment of the day
---
Its somewhere around 47% Alliance and 53% horde.
---
That's 3 globals, if you need 3 seconds to react to an attack better roll PvE.
---
Woo hoo!
---
Barely got any addons to work ;/
---
Server 4,  Layer 7, Shard 11, ashmongold group 4... home.
---
World feels empty as soon as you leave Elwynn Forest.
---
I usually buy game time on sites such as cdkeys or similar. Its cheaper than subscription.
---
amazing imp name btw
---
Pft might as well see 500 people in the same zone at once and get camped by 1 second respawning mobs lol.
---
Nowadays the servers are run using the farm architecture, with a single cluster providing instances for whatever they need (zone, shard, instance, etc).
---
Back when World of Warcraft was released that wasn't an option, so the realms were physically tied to one set of hardware. In the early days after release they had to physically stop shipping CD jewel cases to retailers because they had to acquire and setup more hardware to handle the extra layers.
---
1.13 is the wowclassic. 1.13 never existed in the normal patchcycle.
---
The whole point is we eat shit and take a supplement. If we were eating good in the first place this conversation wouldn't be happening. We will not eat right for w.e. reasons, time, taste, etc. So this is a good conversation to have because psyllium husks are great for people in this situation.
---
very helpful, thanks
---
Didn‚Äôt know classic had addons.
---
I feel the same way. Maybe when I get to 60 I'll install some heal/DPS tracking add-on and some other for improved UI if I ever get into raiding, but until then I'm going full immersion.
---
It was so lonely after a few hours...
---
Blizzard has said spawn's were correct before finding this bug. So many thought dynamic spawns weren't blizzlike.
---
Regarding point 3 - I thought that was what layering was suppose to counter, what am I missing ?
---
Yeah this is pretty accurate - there will be times where you won't have quests to get to ding. I generally kill anything in my path, that seems to help :P
---
I think theres an 50% chance people roll alliance or horde
---
The name tags have become solid green in the middle. never seen before.
---
https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1107316-dynamic-respawns/
---
If you go out of your way there are enough hidden quests to get you to the next level but most people just grind mobs for that final push to the next zone.
---
I‚Äôll tell you how are not businesses run: off of the na√Øvet√© and good will of fanboys. Despite that though you are adamant to excuse everything they do all the same like it‚Äôs your day job.
---
How many shades of grey would you say there are? 50?
---
Not so much a question just something that's come to light this last stress test as perhaps not working.
---
Why not just recycle your own urine?
---
I rolled gnome and walked the first 20 minutes in circles before i got to kill one mob. There were literally hundreds of people
---
When servers went online about 15 minutes afters the start, I got into the queue at position 8620, with estimated time 20 minutes. I was playing in less than 5, seems to be working fine to me.
---
Yes this happens at certain points and you can either grind mobs or switch zones.
---
Westfall to Loch Modan 
---
Or
---
Barrens to Silverpine
---
Yup, both on curse forge
---

---
You shouldn't need to grind, especially in the starter zones. You just missed some quests.  Sounds like you went west to the gnoll area before going east to the logging camp.
---
I keep trying OneBag3 and it won't work for me. Nothing pops up when I hit "B" or "Shift+B". :,(
---
Yh likewise dude
---
I would use it the way you have it becauae i usually don't read flavor text anyway, but I think a checkbook option  somewhere to turn off the auto turn-in would be appreciated by a lot of users.
---
Hmm.  
---
It's a crazy idea. 
---
But it just might work
---
Do you have any videos of what it looks like?
---
I can't get combo points to show either
---
Yea I hope you get it so you can see how fast I'm kickin your ass in that BG,
---
mmmm.. combine that wih noggenfogger and we have a winner!
---
You were able to use the /dom menu and keybind by hovering, then hitting the keys you want? I can do that, but am unable to click on anything other than cancel on the confirm window.
---
Out of curiosity, where did you get your Dominos from, and/or which version is it?
---
&gt; A good castbar that includes enemy and focus castbars  
---
There is no focus target in classic.
---
Particularly from 56 to 60. There's ample chance you will experience a serious quest gap and have to grind mobs A LOT.
---
But back in Our Day, we used to walk uphill both ways in the snow.
---
You and your newfangled Pirate server experience has it way too easy!
---
So a friend of mine did the same thing (learn herbalism at level 1)  and had the same problem, I guess it's a bug!
---
Lol more like his guild is top level and he gets carried
---
In retail I think so, but in Classic you can learn gathering professions at lvl 1 :) seems to be bugged right now though if you get it at that level.
---
This is what you choose to argue against...
---
XD hellyeah
---
Why not just buy a laptop and login there when you need to use the bathroom
---
Shanker- core hound tooth - perdition blade !
---
Fun fact, your name means "Open the door" in Chinese!
---
Should have posted a comparison?
---
&gt; I never experienced ANY issue with layering 
---
We've had a lot of problems. It has required multiple relogs and creating party again to get all people to same layer. I hope this gets fixed at launch.
---
I can do that, but only for I think 5 or 6 specific bars. Can only use about half of the bars that way :(
---
Did you really need to make this generic post mate?
---
Why don‚Äôt you just move your desk to your toilet? I mean... put some pillows around, make it comfortable, and there you go?
---
I doubt this is true, but if so you may be one of the saddest people I know.
---
I dont think you have any idea how many people are going to act all hardcore and look like they did everything they can to be prepared.. And people will get pre raid bis left right and center anyway and they will enchant those.
---
Certain types of AA make the screen very blurry. So in response we could say a similar Reddit comvo killer "some people like blurries I guess".
---
It's a bold move cotton
---
There are going to be tons of people wanting to raid MC instantly. You do not have the time to level, farm all you pots and enchants, farm your pre raid gear and raid.. They will buy stuff and the herbs on AH will be sold out constantly.
---
I feel bad for the casual players that will accidentally roll on Asmongold's server. Not only will it be harder for them to do things, but if he changes game or just changes gear that server is going to be a ghost town.
---
&gt; NA is gonna be fucked with 8 servers
---
I thought that was China that had only 8 servers ...?
---
Hey alright oui oui
---
The streamer avoid server post will actually be useful tbf cause I intend on avoiding those servers aswell .
---
So you prefer speed or meth? What stimulant should I use
---
If you want world pvp but with less corpsecamping then RPPVP is the way to go, otherwise i would suggest going pve.
---
Blizzard's trailers have always been nothing short of amazing. They always have, and still are, leaps and bounds ahead of the entire industry in terms of artistic direction.
---
Questie. What a guy!
---
Theres actually a 100% chance that players will roll either alliance or horde
---
Shut up ya muppet, guilds just need to not pick favourites for rare shit
---
F to pay respects to this guy for speedrunning Mankrik's wife.
---
As far as I know, they are grey because they have no uses in the entire game.
---
So no reason for anyone to buy them.
---
White items are the ones that may have AH value
---
My brother started playing Alliance so I played there until about level 30. Then I roll like four different alts on The Horde and then we stuck with horde for years. Later on I switch to Alliance for a few years and then back to the horde and then back to Alliance. I just can't stick with one faction forever
---
Wait is the game actually out in Europe right now what????
---
the classic client can only be windowed full screen or windowed mode. Both modes rely off the desktops refresh rate which is why there isn't a refresh rate setting in the options. You don't need the OPs config edit you simply need to set the slider to the correct amount of fps because your refresh rate for classic is always going to be your desktops.
---
The IBM Model M122 commonly referred to as the "battlecruiser", you'll need a "Soarer's Converter" to get one of those to work on a modern PC.
---
Old Tauren models looked way better than the new ones.
---
If I recall correctly, yes there is. Pretty sure the earliest available shoulder armor pieces with lowest lvl requirement are grey quality.
---
&gt; do we have to bring back 2004 internet lingo too
---
Yes!
---
Thanks, how do I know if I made it character specific or not?
---
As an adult with limited free time, aka 1-2 hours to play games every day if Im lucky, I am gonna cut in line. I am not ashamed.

---
Millennials don‚Äôt have friends, they‚Äôve grown up playing games rather than going outside. But they still feel the need to be part of a group.
---
So they supplement it with streams and RLM on YouTube as a friend simulator.
---
I have to say I am a bit jealous to, would love to experience it all over again..   
---
An extra thing to point out is take your time don't rush it.. Even if you want to raid in the end don't rush it, you will get there in time and if you cannot go with a raid guilds in time there will be PUG raids..
---
Also never be afraid to ask for help in the game if the community is just a tiny bit of what it was back in the days there will always be people around willing to help no matter if it is with a question, dungeon, quests or something else this was on of the games were even newcomers was threated fairly.. and don't be afraid in dungeons to say you have never done this before as people would be willing to tell you what to do without the "hate factor".  
---
I hope you will enjoy this experience even though graphics and feature wise it might be outdated :) and it is nice to see that newcomers are willing to give this a try even though there is newer and more fancy games out there.
---
i have playlist for classic full of linkin park, nightwish, dragon force, offspring, pendulum, prodigy, slipknot, mushroomhead and skindred because thats what i listened to in vanilla. But only from albums that were out during classic
---
tbf i still listen to some if these artists nowadays so its not that big of a change.

---
is it going to be this crowded in the first days of release?  Its basically impossible to level up
---
I've been looking at that monitor, as well, but I've been hesitant to upgrade to an ultrawide because I already have three monitors. Would you say a single ultrawide is a good replacement for triple monitors or should I get the ultra wide and keep two side monitors?
---
some do 1 and 1 and so forth. I agree with you though. Regardless, wand and tap are basic no-brainers.
---
I don't know exactly about the stress test, but when it comes to how realms/servers evolve over time  
---
PVE slowly trends towards a higher amount of Alliance  
---
PVP stays roughly even
---
Thank you for this info! I thought I was retarded and the rest of the people here weren't ... I had blue labels, that explains it.

pls inv :)

YUSS! THE LINE WILL BE OUR SALVATION!! :D :D
---
No you can't - you need to go to XR to continue to Orgrimmar. Tested on the stress test last night.
---
 YUSS! THE LINE WILL BE OUR SALVATION!! :D :D
---
You were lucky, but yeah, you can get greens from regular mobs.
---
Its only common if you dont know what you are doing.
---
same here, It's crazy to think I was still in middle school last time!
---
Also helps to use a good chair and not sitting like a reclining monkey :D
---
It would be extremely wasteful, and honestly very stupid of someone, to try to gather that type of data from the stress test.
---
Simply put, look how many people in the megathread were saying they were rolling opposite faction just to have some fun before the real thing, or their most hated race / class.
---
Not to mention, this test doesn‚Äôt have many ‚Äúcasuals‚Äù - the real casual player won‚Äôt even know its a thing.
---
So no, while I‚Äôm certain blizzard is tracking that data, they would be fools to attempt anything with it, especially this early in.
---
Just a heads up - I confirmed in the stress test that you can use the above macro to swap from Defensive into Battle, and use Charge, in one single key press.
---
Ah, good point.   
---
Did not think about that.
---
Only 2KRO? that's mildly disappointing. Still it's such a cool piece of hardware.

Any opinion on the modern unicomp boards? They looks like a more accessible option for a daily keyboard but I never really looked that deep into them.
---
All Orc/Troll have the FP in Orgrimmar by default, just need to get to XR for the connection(and you pick up Ratchet FP on the way).
---
Taurens have Thunder Bluff by default, so you can run to CT and fly to TB(if you have the silver).
---
Me too! I'm Mcguinness :) This was amazing!
---
You need 42.000 silithid carapaces for the reputation.
---
You won't have more than one person normally in any one guild who gets that many quest items before another guild with one dedicated scarab lord will have gotten them all and banged the gong.
---
I'm too old and busy to be corpse camped all day by zoomers. There are still big world pvp fights on RP servers (Taren Mill v South Shore). You can just choose when to participate.
---
Ah yes server issues, thank you.  
---
Im in no rush to hit 60, but im in a rush to start playing :D
---
Went to Ironforge the moment I created my character and immediatly noticed that the lava texture was the orange high res one used in retail and not the old red lava texture from vanilla.
---
i mean he needs that karma dose
---
Not a single green drop, but one 6 slot bag
---
This is classic, not tbc or any further expansion with stupid pvp gear. The ones dominating bg's (noone gives a f about world pvp) will be the ones that get fully t3 geared first, which will be 90% alliance just like back during retail as they are the ones with the easy-mode raids.
---
Being on the less populated side is also only beneficial, shorter bg queues &amp; more chance to queue against random pugs -&gt; faster ranking up.
---
You need to set your keybind to main backpack, not open all.
---
Only time I've ever had to grind mobs because I ran out of quests was close to level 60, never in the starting zones.
---
No problem man, it can also mean "Open for business" as in the sign outside a shop.
---
They should at least keep your skeleton until you die again.
---
they don't have to
---
You either get a group/camp a spawn or move to a higher zone it's basically more than possible to level up
---
!remind me 18days
---
Nope, you can but definitely don't have to. You unlock them free at a pretty good rate, definitely quicker than it used to be and they made all the runes free too, given I bought my runes I'm a bit salty about that one.
---
Lvl 19 shoulders, more specifically. And that‚Äôs if you can put naxx enchants on them.
---
Still took me a good 30 minutes in northshire to do the first 3 quests yesterday lol
---
As a Brit I'm glad this part of our culture spreads.
---
Thanks, got an invite yesterday for this Discord, pretty amazing all the info you have there.
---
Is there a way you can see what layer you're in? I invited 2 of my friends to my group, but one of them can't see us.
---
It conflicts with Omen threat meter for me on the stress test. Odd.
---
bro how are you gonna be playing if you got shit in your pants lol i dont think a diaper is a very good solution, maybe go to the bathroom before the leveling, evacuate as much as u can and try to eat and drink the least possible while you level
---
&gt;they are grey because they have no uses in the entire game.
---
Close, but that definition is a little broad. Grey shoulders and helms absolutely have value considering how highly sought after they are when you hit the level range that they start appearing. It‚Äôs always better to have something than nothing.
---
I'm away on holiday for the first week of lunch so I'll be join on week 2. I'm viewing it as a positive as any initial hiccups with the servers will have been sorted by then.
---
Yeah looks like they have a filter by default, but it doesnt seem to work :(
---
There are a couple up on ebay right now in fact. Both asking for $2500+
---
It ain't workin
---
I will miss having you lot on my realm if our group decides on the Nordic realm. Always enjoyed playing with the Dutch ever since 2005.

Would totally roll SL, but I want to raid so that's not really an option. ;/

I believe both John Staats and Mark Kern said Dynamic respawns were a thing in Vanilla, so it's good to see they weren't wrong :)
---
This is false. Streamer guilds wont be in any way shape or form the top guilds.
---
I mean, it showee up. But I didnt get the arrow and it didnt show all quests on the minimap, felt a bit buggy.
---
&gt;t a single green d
---
Yeah i know you can but just not at the frequency i got them my friend who played warrior is almost full green. sadly i'm a priest and didn't get any only leather and mail.
---
I tried getting Clique and Grid working but none of these seem to function in Classic.
---
Amateurs don‚Äôt shit in a bowl or have mom cook hot pockets...
---
And when the guy who‚Äôll replace you retires the keyboard will still be working. 
---
And when the universe enters in the bing crunch the keyboard will still be working.
---
Cool we don't need layering now right? Lol
---
It‚Äôs working for me. Make sure it‚Äôs the version for classic and not the version for original vanilla. I‚Äôll try to look for the link where I got it. Be back fellas.
---
Here we go again... no its not. And you cant use that clip for anything. They are showing leeway on a stationary target. Leeway activates when both are running. Ask yourself: does the guy running into the tree, actually run??
---
Basing your knowledge off of private servers is a mistake.
---
Can't wait to create my warrior, Leeway Jenkins.
---
Oh I wasn‚Äôt even thinking of grey wearable items, I was thinking of like ‚Äúpiece of wolf tail‚Äù or some other grey shit that drops lol.
---
I‚Äôve not played WoW in forever im just trying to hop into the convo lol thanks :)
---
Consuming copious amounts of potato starch is also an excellent way to plug UP your asshole for some 4-5 days. Long enough to reach 60 probably.
---
&gt;Particularly from 56 to 60.
---
Just leveled to 60 on a pserver... 56 to 60 was not an issue.. there are so many max level zones with good quests and you aslo want to start running some dungeons like brd and lbrs, it's not really grindigy at all.. I had undone quests when I hit 60... And even if you want to grind you can grind mobs in that levelrange they drop/give endgame rep, maths or just profitable for grinding your epic mount.
---
The worst grind was level 45-49 as Alliance.... Very few quests and a lot of them just suck.. Once I was done with  Feralas and Tenaris there was nothing to do at appropriate level than to grind for 4 levels. Technichally Hinterlands as well, but that zone is complete garbage as you do 3 quests and done with the whole thing.. also mobs vary A LOT in level there. One second you are fighting a lvl.41 moonkin, right next to him is a 52 elite troll that you accidently aggro... soooo bad.
---
I'd like to add that I am currently logged onto the stress test and have installed aux. I get a game error about an addon causes lots of errors. The first time I chose to ignore the errors, I opened the Auction House and it doesn't load. It's just the default interface. I changed the toc file to match Questie's, just in case, and that actually prevents the addon from showing up at all in the addon list.
---
Thanks so much man &lt;3!
---
So that's why I couldn't skin every mob! I was ensure what was causing it, but I was running into the same issue. Did you make an ingame bug report?
---
&gt;  They're already packed to the point where you just don't progress anymore. 
---
Man people on this subreddit are ridiculous. Layering made the game feel like a ghost town last night. I did 1-6 in about 30 minutes. I'm sorry that other people are playing your single player game.
---
Mulgore was a ghost town
---
Sadly I was in a 2 hour queue yesterday to get in. That's the only thing I hope to try and avoid on launch day.
---
monkaS, play country road
---
Yes I found out that tuk UI is a pathetic shade of pfui so I've changed my ui plans :(
---

---
Yeah there is a "classic" setting.
---
Dont know about tim but didnt towelie say that he doesnt want to play classic. Even tho he got classic beta and suddenly jumped the ship on it? Dont think you need to count him in if he plays to lvl 20 and realises that pally cant tank anything other than dungeons

"If you delete a character during the name reservation period, the name of the deleted character will be available for others to use right away. This is how it works in the live game as well.

Looool, talk about a macro selling "Grey" items, because this is **literally** what this does:
---
`string.find(n,"9d9d9d")` is checking the part of the item info, that represents **what color the descriptive text is in** :D "9d9d9d" is hexadecimal for a light shade of grey:
---

Well done sir =)
---
If you install WeakAuras there is currently a weakaura for rogues and other melee with energy/swing timer build into it
---
Who knows, might very well end up on the same server if you're going PvP. ^^^^dutchspeakers ^^^^can ^^^^into ^^^^nordic
---
Commenting so I can be in the post
---
yes
---
Sounds very interesting, I will take a look later this day on the discord channel.

I'm just putting a waterproof sheet on the floor and power washing it away when the smell starts to overwhelm me
---
Grab Tailoring/Ench early for the Lesser Magic Wand for sure, getting ~60 Linen isn't a chore, especially since you'll get the bulk of it passively just questing in your intro zones.
---
If you fancy the Greater Magic Wand I wouldn't recommend leveling there yourself if you don't plan on continuing enchanting. It'd work out cheaper to just buy one off AH.
---
Great wand though, will be worth buying if it's reasonably priced!
---
If you really never played vanilla wow, you're up for quite an adventure! I played it 14 years ago and never experienced anything close to it regarding overall gaming enjoyment before and after. 
---
Don't rush your leveling! This game is called *World* of Warcraft for a reason, and the world is actually the main attraction of the game, not raids and battlegrounds. They were added just to engage players already reached 60 so they had something to do, and over the years endgame content somehow became main thing about wow, not the world itself, which is just plain sad. But Classic is much better balanced in that regard, and leveling a character feels like an actual adventure, not some annoying obstacle on the way to max level, like in retail. Enjoy! 
---
One more thing - choose a side, race and class that you like, don't make these choices based on someone else's understanding. All classes in classic are viable and each of them have both strengths and weaknesses, though sometimes they might not be obvious.
---
No need to be sorry. We can understand fine
---
Given how old this hardware is, it's a testament to how optimised Blizzard's server client must've been back then to support even a few thousand players, Nost-core wouldn't have a chance on hardware like this.
---
I‚Äôll gladly be on the ‚Äúabsolute asshole‚Äù list so I don‚Äôt have to play with delusional children such as yourself. Your life must be very stressful if you take this so seriously, how do you cope with the real world? I‚Äôm genuinely curious.
---
Why would there be only 2 pvp servers
---
Asmongold said classic will fail so why play on his server?
---
Haaaaaaaaa you think I have a sleeping oattern in the opening weeks ?!
---
Haha. I think is true to an extent. Especially after seeing that study that suggested that millennials aren't having as much sex as previous generations. 
---
We are victims of technology, I guess. Previous generations never had to contend with entertainment so good that you never want to leave your house.
---
Damn, I missed it. Thought it was today. I was hoping to get my addons and UI frames in order a bit, so I wouldn't have to do that at launch.
---
I noticed classic-ready addons like zPerl fail on retail and on pservers.
---
Why not just get a fucking porta potty you animal
---
That's enough to bring a tear to a grown mans eye right there.
---
I camped Sarkoth for a good 45 minutes before I managed to tag it with my 5 man group. There were like 60 people waiting around for him. Completely gave up on the medallion after like half an hour. I was barely level 4 after 2 hours, then I logged out. And that was with like 80% of the people in the Valley just jumping around the quest hub or dueling, because nobody really cared about progressing. It was fun for a bit, but if every questing area up to like level 20-30 (when it finally spreads out over the continent and into dungeons) is like this then I won't enjoy the game at all, and without layering it would probably be worse. 
---
I played on a ghost server on retail for way too long, I definitely don't want back to that. But if every questing area is full of players desperately trying to tag the respawning quest mob, it also leaves nothing of the Classic leveling experience. 
---
You were either online very late when most people left again already, or you ended up in a layer with reduced size (I kinda remember a statement from Blizzard saying they were intentionally messing with that to test it out).
---
Watface.
---
FOR THE HERD
---
It's not hate, it's simply stating that Classic will, once again, be quite different from pservers. It's just interesting to find all these little differences.

google is your friend. I ain't doing that. tis lot of work as is.
---
That seems to be a very convenient implementation for the starter zones. Especially it's dynamic so that they can have that respawn trigger when there's still *n* mobs around instead of after the last.
---
This is fucking gross. Never go that far in a FUCKING VIDEO GAME.
---
What amazed me was the frame rate and the ping. Hundreds of players and the game runs smoothly. I mean, I know hardware and internet connection are better now, but it made the game feel so good.

And I'm happy I found a guild a few days ago. Running around together, doing silly stuff and talking shit on TS .... Sooooo good!

Yea i was certain that respawns were insanely fast which made questing doable.

China got confirmed 8 servers. RP-PvP, RP, PvE and PvP among them (I guess once RP, one Rp-PvP and 3 of each PvE and PVP? Who knows).
---
If EU gets 8 servers it'll look like this:
---
ENG: 1 RP-PvP, 1 RP, 1 PvE 1 PvP
---
German: 1 PvE 1 PvP
---
French: 1 PvE 1 PvP
---
I guess if they decide to add more servers before launch it'll be 1 or 2 more PvP servers for ENG.
---
But again, it's all speculations and they could add 16 EU servers.. Who knows? All we got is the Chinese confirmations and China have always had as many players as every other region combined.

I think the theory is 5pm in America

How good are druids for level 60 gold grinding? Besides mara and DM farming
---
This subreddit is already devolving.
---
If your feel more at home with horde you will obviously prefer it there and if you roll ally anyway you might get to the mid 30s - 40s then realize you'd rather be a hordie and then end up switching after spending so much time on your first toon.
---
You can play a game with enough dignity to show respect to others tho. Makes the difference between ppl mining ores asap in a dungeon and the group rolling for it. Not saying I think Qs are necessary, but the point stands.
---
What are you expecting the difference between any of the four to be?
---
Amazing! Thanks so much
---
Nothing's changed really. Going to level super casually. Work on fishing at level 5, maybe try to quest late at night when players go to bed

I only know of Lights hope thats actually closing and that could have changed but I imagine they will still host a few vanilla for the people who are too poor to actually pay for a sub and probably move the majority on to TBC and Wrath.

Make sure you're not in my server if you're planning on stealing names
---
Too bad this example is a gross exaggeration
---
Play druid healer if you want to be geared as fast as possible in raids. T1 and T2 drops a lot for them and there are always like 1-2 druid per whole raid. Druid tank is awesome in dungeons. Balance and feral dps are pretty much meme in raid environment, but usable dor dungeon and pvp environments. Also leveling druid is most interesting and also most fun I would say.
---
It won't work in classicwow, different macro architecture entirely to vanilla.
---
Totally srs
---
Is this what peaking looks like?
---
no shit, cuz most ppl aren't that far. It's a stress test. People stop playing at a certain point because progress doesn't get saved
---
Duh ! We are not even supposed to meet girl to begin with. Dude ! Come on, don't betray us like that. The only thing she should be allowed to do is playing healer or support in league of legends but that's only because we are respectful of women and know what's best for them.

Brilliant !

I've always wanted to script/macro something that sells BOP items that I cant equip (i.e. clothie gets a plate shoulder or gun as a quest reward) , not sure if theres' anything that could be adapted from your macro to do it though

So I'm super stuck on whether or not to play warrior or rogue. I didn't play either class until MoP so I don't have any experience with their rotation in classic. I want to DPS, and I would enjoy being able to tank 5 mans, but I don't really have any interest in tanking in raids. Could someone give me any insight into what class they prefer at 60 in terms of fun? I enjoy a challenge at leveling so I don't mind the stigma attached to warrior leveling. I also get a lot of fun out of being at the top of dmg meters so what class would be superior in that department? One of the turn offs for rogue for me is also the idea that they are extremely cd dependent, something I'm not too fond off. 
---
Any insight would be greatly appreciated!
---
This is extremely plausible. Activion Blizzards moto lately has been all about cutting costs lately.
---
why is it weird? I think it's better for trasperancy
---
And I give mages Blessing of Might, because you never know
---
I think its like in lazypig, that it accepts it BEFORE it times out, not straight away. Obviously havent tested it yet (and its just one checkmark to disable that part).
---
God uses adult diapers, is "averagely obese" and plays Classic World of Warcraft. Ahh... What a time to be alive!
---
Make sure you download the TukUI classic and not Tukui. There was a link to the classic version a bit "hidden" in their forums on the general thread.
---
That's the one that worked for me. The folder itself was named classic so you recognize it from that.
---
I've been using this one for 15 years
---

---
It's implemented to counter character position desync yes, but it's not triggered by anything related to character position.
---
The only requirement is that both you and your target are strafing or running. You don't need to actually change position.
---
This has been confirmed countless times, and running into a wall in Ratchet has become the standard metric for testing leeway hitboxes. 
---
Besides, the video above literally demonstrates it for you - why would his melee leeway activate on moving if his target wasn't counted as moving?
---
I remember you! :) I played a paladin I‚Äôm fractured named Megumi!

---
&lt;Hero Association&gt;**
---
Good afternoon fellow raiders. 
---
&lt;HA&gt; plans to be both a social hub as well as an active raiding guild. We like to maintain a laid back attitude outside of raiding, but take progressing seriously both in terms of preparation and during raids themselves. We do not aim for server firsts etc, but we do want to steadily progress through and clear all the content.
---
We aim to maintain a good community of friends without sacrificing endgame progression. We're looking for solid players who want to properly apply themselves to the challenges Classic brings, while also being reliable and social. To us, quality is more important than quantity - but we are welcoming of new people, and will be happy to show and teach you, to help you progress with us. All we ask is that you put effort into it, and have a similar passion for the game as we do.
---
We will have 3 days per week dedicated to raiding, with times of 21:00-00:00 Server time / 20:00-23:00 UK time Monday, Tuesday and Thursday. We require consistent raid attendance, however we will also be understanding if some events make you unable to participate at a given date, as long as you let us know in advance.
---
Looting will be done via loot council system for 40man raiding, and rolling for 20man raiding (barring a few exceptional items).
---
We are currently recruiting most classes and roles, and we are always open to non-raiding socials (so you are welcome to bring your friends or family with you!). 
---
Feel free to jump in and get in touch with me (Ethan) or any of the GMs (Krabby, Sheeny or dark) to get yourself an application form. 
---
ALL CLASSES AND SPECS ARE OPEN.

See you in there.

So I'm super stuck on whether or not to play warrior or rogue. I didn't play either class until MoP so I don't have any experience with their rotation in classic. 
---
Here's what I'm looking for: 
---
- Overall best DPS class in PVE. (A lot of the fun I get out of the game is hitting those high numbers)
---
- Being able to tank 5 mans but not tanking in raiding - is this realistic?
---
- What has the easiest rotation? I enjoy simple rotations
---
- Fun. What would you consider to be more fun at 60?
---
- Side note I also don't mind if leveling is a slog, I really enjoy a challenge when it comes to leveling. 
---
Any insight into these points would be greatly appreciated!
---
Congrats on the job, mate
---
Probably not.
---
I only want them to put it up so I can stop fucking hearing about it and you people bitching
---
Just an FYI,
---
I tried to get this printed and they threw it back to me saying they can't print copyrighted material. (This was @Copyguru  in Hungary, gonna try some other places)

They have a point, but I don't know how valid a copyright claim is if the print is no longer available anywhere officially.

Dude, there's girls and then there's... Girls.. With a capital G. When I met her we talked a bit about WoW. I thought she was one of those girls (not capital G) that "played" games.
---
She got me into playing retail a bit, I went over to her with my laptop and we played together. Showed her my (yes, frikkin legit) Baron Rivendares mount. Thought she'd be impressed.
---
No. She had one. She had all of them. She's the nerdiest nerd ever. She fights for her shit. She doesn't even fucking suck at the game. I was like is diz a trap? IT WASN'T. And if it was, I would honestly not care. No one has died from a bit of poking.
---
Now we've just moved in together hyping the shit out of Classic. Unfortunetly she's also the  cog in the wheel that made my friends choose Alliance instead of Horde so I might have to get rid of her =/
---
I got kicked on retail for typing in BG chat. Guess they didn't want people socializing.
---
Don‚Äôt be an idiot, he‚Äôs not gonna get blacklisted for tagging mobs faster.

Oh really? Is there an easy browse list that states what does drop in phase 1?

---
Speaking about cities from other factions: how you guys think raids on them will work out? Back in the time servers crashed all the time and I remember blizzard even stating servers were not meant to hold this raids. I might remember the last point wrong
---
Yup ALSO this is just launch day/week and not every day for the whole classic experience
---
Might be the case, but this is the only reliable test that can really show the full potential of the mechanic.
---
My main problem with leeway is how it makes combat feel sluggish and delayed. Without leeway, you have a good feel for when a mob/player is in range of you - with leeway, it feels like an inconsistent half-ranged distance that you can't really gauge.
---
Cope.
---
Alot of min/max PvP rogues are going orc. Should be a bit easier this time around.
---
Best part was how much server community involvement there was for a 24hr server and temporary characters!
---
Most rocks and pebbles
---
Also it isn't that different. Regardless of what little differences are ultimately found, 1x blizzlike private servers are a far more faithful recreation of the original game than I thought was possible before I actually tried one.
---
Cheers, panicked then

Fear inculum is the new single and the new album is called 10000 days if anyone searches for them.

It was rebuilt after it got Sacked and occupied by the Horde in The First War, it was never fully destroyed, and was already a large thriving nation before then. Its size, park, districts and Outer Wall perimeters were already in place before VanCleef showed up, they just needed to be fixed, the only change to size SW had after The First War was that a lot of people died.

jokes beside, i think it will stay like in retail few tanks... a lot dps
---
I like to make a character on both sides.  But Im casual so I dont know if you can split the effort between both factions and go really far.  I play on non pvp servers so I could have a character in each faction on the same server.  Sometimes I would switch back and forth between them during the same world pvp fight depending on which side was winning haha.  Id join the losing side becuase I wanted to help keep the fight balanced and keep it going as long as possible.
---
Anyone know if Sexymap is coming to classic? Or another addon that lets me change the scale of the minimap?
---
Male or female tauren?
---
Male has better healing cast animations but looks ridiculous in cloth/leather.
---
Almost. He holds some of the processors and volatile storage across which this world would have been interpreted, but certainly none of the world‚Äôs data.
---
Tram to ironforge, run to run morogh mountains, drop down into west fall, die, Res, boat, darnassus, teldrassil starting zone.
---
Ain't paying 1000g for a fucking horse at 60.
---
Oh man you won't be able to get off your pc. Do it. It's that awesome.
---
I played back in vanilla and I have so much good memories from back then, I can't wait to dive into it again!
---
Oh yeah that matters. I mean for real, this isn't sarcastic.
---
I'm one of those people
---
Gray/white shoulders tended to sell regardless because people were always excited to finally be able to wear the things. That slot is easily empty for 20-30+ levels unless you go out of your way to fill it.
---
Mine is covered in 1-10's
---
On every private server I have ever played on you need an add on to show healing text. I don't remember if that is the way it was in vanilla, but I imagine that it is intentional. Additionally when you go into the settings there is no option to see your heals, only heals that you receive
---
Well there won't be any good vanilla servers up n running once N closes down. Have fun running around on trash servers like K and NH.
---
Those guys will switch eventually.
---
Only 4 fps? I remember it being more like 20.
---
I've been convinced that I'm rolling Paladin since classic was announced.
---
But recently look interest in the Druid due to the ability of ranged spellcasting. Question is there a viable balance with a feral/resto mix spec? And how good is that for PVP and DPS?
---
Also, what is the best DPS spec for druids?
---
Cheers - total druid noob
---
Nah m8, I got a pressure washer
---
This really significant, you might not realize it. Getting ahead of the zerg can easily save you 2 day of /played on 1-60
---
There is only two servers for all of the EU during the stress test. You are not currently on an English sever, you are on a European one.
---
When it comes to retail there will be language specific servers for French and German but you will still see people speaking other languages.
---
Energy drinks ready to go
---
People not understanding what dynamic respawn is.
---
Good point, i'm saving the excitement for the first day
---
Mike Kern is my favorite wow dev
---
No, it is not illegal to talk other languages than english on a EU server :P The simplest thing to do is just ignore it or if you really can't stand it just ignore the player and his chat wont show up.
---
It's called comquestive disorder.
---
How do i know (when addon searching) if an addon is for classic wow or private servers? I followed a link from willitclassic but it was for version 8.2
---
It sure worked yesterday!
---
conquestive disorder ;-)
---
can i right click and report all of them when on a english server? or will blizzard ban me for racisim (rolleyes)
---
[Here's what it does on Classic Stress Test](https://i.imgur.com/8eHtHdh.png) Works great, thanks!
---
Nobody buffs each other once they get their mounts :(
---
I will play on german servers and forsen certainly on english ones. There aren‚Äòt many big german Classic streamers so I am pretty relaxed üòé
---
this is my point tho Naspac. all of what you said may be true but its not different then what I said. the issue here is the truth is 4
---
&gt;if you want to play it then have fun just know you will not be elite at anything end game.
---
this is the truth. but the arguments the clueless majority of people state is that Enhance Shamans are UNPLAYABLE and that you should not roll them. that is not the case. 
---
was very surprised though at the amount of shamans on the stress test tho was hoping I would be one of a few. 
---
I think the interests of the wow classic community as a whole are quite different to what is portrayed on the reddit.
---
Clean the bucket? I see where the math went wrong.
---
Yeah, this will not happen on live, it will be spam feast to try and tag it first :D
---
Launch is all about getting ahead of the pact, you will not do that by lining up for some SUPREME shirt.
---
Hey there! Thanks for this amazing guide. I have just one question so far. I tried adding the charge/intercept macro during the stress test and while the mod for charge works perfectly, if I do not press a modifier there is only the red question mark shown. Is there a way to let the game display the normal charge icon while not pressing anything? I don't want my bars full of those question marks until I press a mod. Any help would be appreciated!
---
At least in a fresh private server I played recently I could easily buy linen cloth from players to craft green robes that I disenchanted for materials to craft a wand that sold to other players for more than what I paid for the linen cloths. 
---
It's easier to do in a zone like Brill that has a lot of humanoids and undead that drop cloth. The only reason I didnt stay there selling wands to make some gold is because I didn't want to stay behind the zerg of players, so as soon as I had level 70 enchanting I crafted a greater magic wand and left.
---
The body is still warm!
---
Yes I reported it. Hope they fix it before launch.
---
https://i.imgur.com/aRsDJEa.png
---
Curious, my laptop can't run classic wow. My pc can. Is there a way I can still play on my laptop via alternative method?
---
Let's hope Blizzard will fix this for the game release! *Fingers crossed*
---
Should have been the Eastern Plaquelands!
---
You should just start grinding whatever you can find, then move on.
---
You could very quickly make a macro and when you wanna spam it just change the text in the macro
---
Don't remind me :-( I had forgotten, after years and years of playing Tauren druid..
---
What I have gathered is that there exists a modern system called dynamic respawns in BFA and newer expansion. Also there exists/existed a system back in vanilla WoW that was not called dynamic respawns but which regulated respawn rates based on amounts of living NPCs of a given type.   
---
The title of this post is misleading because it calls the Classic/vanilla system by the modern systems name (maybe to deliberately ride the wave of arguments and controversy?).
---
Guy
---
&gt; does it not depend where you download the addon? How do I know I download the latest version?
---
There may be addon management programs. I'm not sure, I'm coming over from private servers so I'm used to doing things manually. But I'd try to download from the creator's github if possible, or their website if available.
---
Copy the folder over to _classic_/Interface/Addons and make sure you get rid of any special characters (including -master which will be appended to github downloads).
---
&gt;Is there "The" download portal for classic addons?
---
willitclassic.com seems best atm.
---
Lawful evil.
---
No but if they let the mob finish you, yes.
---
Was her name Asmon
---
Tryhard
---
Bartender4 is being done for classic.
---
No the language tag is basically just to designate the language support is provided in. It does not stipulate any particular language must be spoken.
---
5 hours at the toilet during 1-60 powerleveling, why 5 hours. Do you need to read a magazine every time wtf.
---
If it bugs you Id say pick a different race.  Different game but I had initially, in GW2, made a human rogue (been a couple years i forget what they are called) but for some reason later made an Asuran (gnome equivelent) rogue instead.  He was named after my account and was my main but I never loved him like I would have if I'd stuck with human.  Just because the human rogue animations were so good imo.  By the time id realized it I already had some human characters as other classes and wanted at least one of each.
---
TLDR.  ya animations can bug you a long time
---
yeah, it's an inconceivable loss that Shabu couldn't find the time to patch pfUI for classic. He was really clear about it when I talked to him about it. He has a life now haha.
---
Just do /luna menu (or was it /luna config), go to the options and press LOCK FRAMES. Then it will turn off the config mode and show the actual bars.
---
Something I noticed was right as you let go of a movement key and cast a spell it would not start the spell, yet this works on 1.12 pservers. Maybe it‚Äôs latency, maybe its something to get used to idk.
---
I really liked the interface and graphic options, ran much smoother on 144 hz than the old client.
---
Just wait for that Hpal/War combo to roll all over you in Wpvp
---
You just roll 2k10 instead like in WFRP
---
To me setting up my addons is worth 3 beers.
---
IKR and the album releases just a few days after launch as well, going to be a great time!
---
Rogues can beat a warrior with nothing but a dagger, but if your lack of skill makes you feel like you need gear to be able to PvP, then sure: Keep spouting the same nonsense.
---
Great, you're stupid and illiterate.
---
The targeted vs. un-targeted strafing has been reported (and fixed?) before, but I am not sure if that is what you mean here. Can you show a clip?
---
I thought that this was why they took it out
---
&gt; pulmonary embolism
---
everybody talks about that.  When I had major surgery and was in a hospital bed for a week, they gave me daily shots.  When I broke my ankle, they perscribed me shots to self inject (because I was off work for four weeks).
---
Maybe I should tell doctors how I can spend all weekend in bed playing games ...
---
Original launch was the most insane shit ever.
---
Hopefully this will be close, the private servers I tried on launch was intense but nothing like original wow launch day.
---
The chaos is what makes it fun af because it drives you mentally insane.
---
I got to 5 got no greens no bags nada, best thing I got was a grey shield but I gave it to a shammy. drop rates seem fine to me.
---
But it's hard to stay ahead of Zerg without constant harassing and denying bases. Sure, scouting is important, but it won't win you games unless you're using it to deny economy to the Zerg.
---
In case you are asking a serious question and don't know the meme [link to the original](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cjrmyv/character_creation_in_2_weeks/)
---
I'm pretty close to recreating my UI from when I played Vanilla, and it's about 10 addons. That's just UI, no boss mods or auctioneer or decursive or anything like that. Now, I wouldn't skip classic if I couldn't make my own UI, but it sure as hell would suck being stuck with the default UI.
---
Me too. Auto-accept and auto-turnis are better if the feature is optional. I want to read quest text too
---
Yeah but that doesn't work with my silly joke =(
---
I'm almost certain I read they were announcing them following the stress test. So like; sometime today.
---
Don't quote me on that though.
---
Well i havent yet complained about political talk in trade chat but it sure doesnt belong there... theres always a way to create another channel for it. ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
I dont remember how to create chat channels but my server used to have a /retro channel for all those who wanted to do legacy-raids... this started during TBC and continued well into wotlk and cata... then it died out. Fun times!
---
Any idea if it will be ready by launch?
---
I have booked off launch day and was very concerned about mob respawn rates as everyone said it would be impossible and take ages.
---
everyone was wrong as per and now I have no concerns and am buzzing for my first evr launch day (played since Vanilla)
---
TukUI has a basic version working but it's a very stripped down version. ElvUI will be available post launch.
---
BEST YEAR EVER
---
I'm a fan of the macro I lovingly label as "YEET" which automatically throws away a Soul Shard in your bag one at a time when you press it. Great for cleaning up bag space while leveling 
---
/run i="Soul Shard"d=1 for x=0,4 do for y=1,GetContainerNumSlots(x) do  if (d&gt;0) then l=GetContainerItemLink(x,y)  if l and GetItemInfo(l)==i then PickupContainerItem(x,y) DeleteCursorItem() d=d-1 end end end end

Right on. Mostly just want the action bars and nameplates.

dude I cannot wait to go back to the shimmering flats!!!
---
I miss the glory days of Twisting Netherlands
---
Literally no one said that.
---
That's definitely not one of the reasons. The most user friendly rading loot system is master looter. You put all your trust in one person who will be held accountable by the threat of exclusion and ostracization. In your case, your guild(s) was not filled with good people, which led to people getting away with shitty actions.
---
But that's okay. Shitty people deserve getting shit on. That's why a major part of MMOs is *finding the right people*, not just being good. If you let people get away with stealing your loot, you don't punish them for it, or you willingly stay in a guild where people behave like shit. Well, you deserved it. It is very, very seldom that someone you trust deeply betrays you.
---
For the record. The only type of loot system that takes away all power from the guild is personal loot. Personal loot is in the game now. It sucks.
---
But dynamic respawn was in vanilla, the experience you are describing is not authentic to vanilla wow.
---
I think the idea of layering is actually worse than it is in practice because for the first 2 hours in the starter zones was craaaazy busy so you wouldn't know about layering unless we were told about it. So im not worried in the slightest after playing ST for release.
---
Yeah old UI is quite difficult to accept again you are right ahahahah
---
Happy to have german and french servers in EU. Imagine the chaos that would‚Äòve happened on EU non language specific servers...
---
exactly ;)
---
Personally, I can't even get the config options to open.
---
I've tried all the command, LUF Luna Menu, Luna Config etc, and I know these commands are correct because isntead of getting the "Type /help for a listing of a few commands" it just doesn't let me submit the text bar.
---
No point reporting for a stress test. Seems a little petty considering this isn't going to be a problem in two weeks time.
---
Leveled a character on ND unofficial vanilla server. At like lvl 56 in searing gorge where there are thos red dinosaurs in the cave, i believe called incendosaurs, i went in to do the quest, i saw a mage killing them so i invited them to get it done quicker. The very first dino after we formed the group dropped an Edgemaster's Handguards. We both greedrolled and the mage won. I was just laughing cos this is the perfect example of my luck. But i wasn't mad since it didn't matter at this stage fo the server and with classic coming. Shit happens
---
Willitclassic but it doesn‚Äôt work right so don‚Äôt bother.
---
I had the same issue...vendors had a noticeable lag when buying or selling anything.
---
However, I was mostly talking about the experience of playing Classic WoW at modern FPS rates...it felt almost weird to have such a smooth experience for the old game after years of private servers and the old real servers....it almost felt too fluid.
---
Yeah. I decided it will be better to wait 16 hours and then log in and play. Will be a lot less stresfull.
---
...also that happens to be when i get home from work, launch time is 1am for me and work in the morning..
---
in that case, disregard my previous statement.
---
You can turn these tips off in the Interface menu.
---
Do you have to have an active subscription to download the client? Still got nothing.
---
Or have a friend suck on it with their mouth!
---
Imagine not having the ability to create a unique personality online that you need to reserve the name before people take it before you.
---
What settings did you play on for the stars to display?
---
It's because a ton of layers were created in the starting zones for the popular areas but most people didn't progress far into questing for this stress test. So those layers had most of their players in the starting zone but the few % that ventured out saw an empty server.
---
It was the same in Brill.
---
Gentleman is club?
---
There is a hyper-niche balance resto talent build where you go something like 23/7/21.  You play mostly as a resto druid, hotting and running, but you pick up damage and crit talents for moonfire as well as nature's grace to get out some hasted damage whenever you proc crits.  
---
It is only valid for wpvp, flag carring, and dueling.  Even then I suspect a full or almost full resto druid build would work as well or better.
---
literally said it everywhere...
---
So how is it 10 mins before the end.
---
People didn't progress past the starting zone that's why it was a ghost town on top of the layering.
---
95+% of your layer was just chilling in the starting area so as soon as you moved out you became alone (since we have layering and not sharding). It will feel different at launch when people actually progress.
---
I hear the orc female animations are pretty good. Have you considered playing horde?
---
!remindme 19 days
---
Glad to see more hordees in the flurry of alliance
---
There'll probably be more
---
Im still holding out hope for bartender.

Hi, /u/Forderva

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/co0uk3/will_the_thorium_brotherhood_reputation_recipes/). 
---
Uhm but PrivetVanillaRUSx50XP server didn't have dynamic spawns...
---
Shouldn't it be 256 if you count white and black as shades of grey?
---
You need the same color code for all three colors and you can go from 00 to FF. Considering FF is 255 that should give you 256 different shades or am I missing something?
---
It will be packed. But that's why they are using the layering for the first few weeks. Hopefully nothing will break but yes questing will.be a challenge alone. But try and group up for any kill quests
---
It isn't population based. He is right. It's based on the number of mobs alive. That's it. You can have 1 million players in the starter zone if the 999,990 of them don't kill the mobs they are not gonna respawn any faster for the remaining 10 farming.
---
My brother and I grouped up and it took about a minute for him to come to my later. I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs because of the internal timer they‚Äôve put in to stop people from layer hopping for resource nodes. It really wasn‚Äôt a big deal and we didn‚Äôt have to relog to get it to work, just wait. As a temporary measure it seems to be working pretty well for what it is.
---
The only viable PvE DPS spec for Druids is Feral. It's a pretty complex spec but can achieve great DPS if you put in the effort.
---
It looks like this:
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLVhoZE0MsfbdtV
---
There isn't really a hybrid spec that is viable for Resto and Feral PvE. 
---
There is a good spec that is a Tank/Healer hybrid and also works really well for PvP. It looks something like this:
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zZxxhscMdLVxsoGo
---
There are also more spellcaster focused builds for PvP, and can work as a resto spec in PvE. Sadly spell casting in PvE is not viable. There is some theory crafting about a melee-moonkin build (spamming moonfire in-between auto-attacks) but it's still low DPS.
---
Please check out the Druid Gods on YouTube for more:
---
Shedothedruid (Feral DPS PvE)
---
SkarmTank(Feral Tank PvE)
---
Stormx (PvP)
---
Druid is really fun and engaging, definitely a change of pace from Paladin lol. 
---
Hope that helps!
---
Hell I was still raiding aq40 with it. Good old days of pallypowers + decursive.

I'm not sure if you're trolling but I'll take the bait anyway; The new album hasn't released yet, and it's called Fear Inoculum like the single just released.
---
10000 days is the most recent release back from 2006.
---
No more flyng bananas. They ruined the immersion of the game too much. You never bumped into other players. Plus, flying banana's were pretty much a god mode button.
---
I'm not going to do that.
---
Look at that mama! People are having fun without me! I HATE THEM!
---
Sure ok.
---
You know you want to!
---
&gt; Pitbulls are picked by bad people

Yep.

Congratulations, you just played yourself. It is indeed a breed that is designed for dog-fighting and "self defense". No amount of propaganda is going to change that fact.
---
G-G-G-G-G-UNIT
---
Well it doesn't come out until the 30th of this month, so there's probably only about 10-20 people in the world that could answer your question
---
Asmon bad, RP good
---
On 1.12.1, abilities activate when you release the key, but on classic they activate when you press the key down. This is probably what caused the difference for you.
---
They downvoted me for my Street Fighter joke. Some of you users are alright. Don't go to the dojo tomorrow.
---
I was wrong, not 65k. It would only be 255, As 8 digits in binary can make 255. Maybe 256 since you'd be counting 0000 0000 as well?
---
But yeah, 65k was completely wrong answer
---
What about the tried and true bottle pee?
---
Must have missed this, it's great news
---
Damn, I can almost hear the wind wisping past my ears in the barren 
---
Thank you for the memories
---
What about building an user interface which has fewer elements and stays out of your way? The vanilla UI is quite lacking by modern standards.
---
Spawn rates only seemed tweaked in the starter zone from my experience which I'm okay with.  Get people on and through the proverbial gate and into the start of the game.
---
The game is lightly threaded, it's mostly single core bound, but at least in Legion, there is some performance scaling up to 4 cores/threads.
---
Ouai "book" en am√©ricain pourrait √™tre un meilleur exemple. Et oui c'est bien pour √ßa que j'avais choisi le mot "murder", c'est que dans le context avec le r il sonnait comme √ßa.
---
With 3. Do you really want a macro that ONLY attacks mouseover, aka not target if no mouseover exists?
---
On 2. I believe you need to write a specific macro for each pet, which takes about 10 seconds to do.
---
Or you can join an elitest guild and not have to worry about random people. Create your own groups and recruit people.  If your a solo player with little vanilla experience and you got attitude it might not play out as well though haha.  
---
That said i do agree karma is very real in classic.
---
It is possible to AOE farm as a caster :)
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j74ReCCCr4k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j74ReCCCr4k)
---
I agree, this does seem possible.
---
Does it have the new bfa character models?
---
I did not know you could use bfa graphics
---
The Inv asmon layer phenomen will happen to you maybe a total of 1 hour out of 1000 that you play. The rest of the 999 you won't see that in your chat. It's only gonna happen during big events that they organize and esp. at the beginning of launches and such when a lot of new people want to join the event. If you are not literally during the event or its after launch and people have friends in the right layers you won't ever notice it.
---
The hate is so overblown and makes the community more toxic than it needs to be.
---
And here I thought it was going to be because "you don't know who the person is behind the screen" lol. Yes, be nice to people only for your own gains!
---
Thanks! Really appreciated
---
Yes that's why there's a crit cap for white hits.
---
But it shouldn't really matter.
---
Addons are NOT required. But QoL says I will be using a few. One I am really hoping to see is Arkinventory. I loved the ability to auto-sort my bags.
---
You're right, I haven't studied computer science in like 3 years so I've become hella rusty at it
---
That is interesting indeed and unexpected. Thanks for testing it.
---
If you make it to lvl 12 (where you get overpower afaik?) can you test if something like 
---
    /use Battle Stance
---
    /use Overpower
---
only requires 1 press? Just to confirm that Charge isn't handled differently in some way
---
There's not enough passed out drunk dwarves on the ground

I can't believe this is upvoted. People are literally this delusional. Yes all those people there paid $100,000 to Asmongold just to be noticed. He is secretly Jeff Bezos. Not that &lt;1% of them paid like $3-10 in thanks for the otherwise free entertainment.
---
Sorry if this is a stupid question. But where it says  
---
 "You‚Äôll also be restricted to one faction (Horde or Alliance) on PvP realms. "
---
Has this always been the case? I feel like I used to have a horde and an alliance character on the same realm.

Tried it,, works perfect! Thank you

I don't think that mouse is gonna charge much on that mouse pad.. You can just send it to me, I have a mouse that will charge just fine one it.
---
WHAT
---
I feel like modern animations and detail have actually made the client behave much worse in Wpvp than ever before.
---
The slideshow begins after a 20 v 20 for me in retail. I don't think that the same will happen as badly in Classic.
---
I certainly agree with your last sentence!
---
I used addons that would automatically sell greys when I opened a vendor tab. (Not in vanilla though). Macros need a manual activation, right?
---
I hate this idea tbh. I want Classic to be Vanilla, not something else. "Hey lets preserve this master piece painting, but lets paint in some more details first" smh
---
I watched them tumble down... (Retail)
---
Feral DPS is the most complex rotation in the game imo. There is so much going on and it's very engaging!
---
Bk in vanilla I played a Feral Druid, just to be like the Druids of the claw from WC3, anyway, as I was dueling ppl i discovered that going Bear &amp;/or cat is not working, i loose,  that is when i learned to powershift, i didnt even know it was called powershifting i just did it on my own &amp; used all my forms utilities &amp; won most of my duels.  yea, no wonder the 1st Talent tree is called "Balance"
---
I was using questie today,  deff is working in classic.
---
I hope u are not horde so i can camp ur low level quest targets with my highlvl char. No mercy. Its war not fun and friendly arena gaudi
---
No kungentv listed? Shame!
---
Nah, first you kill them honorably and only then you do stuff like these.
---
There‚Äôs thousands of these threads. If you take a few minutes to look all of this has been done.
---
Please read again.
---
In 1.12 the cap for almost all player dungeons was 10. The exceptions were Scholomance, BRD, Stratholme and BRS.  
---
You could 10 man most Vanilla dungeons even in TBC.
---
For me it seemed like client lag as the mob would then re-aggro back to them if I didn't engage it.
---
So are you saying I should get some? Do I need to ask my fiance√© to clean me up while I play? Just trying to work out the logistics.

Also could you please DM me the list of stimulants you used and where I'm likely to find them?
---
Are you more of a PvP or a PvE player?
---
Glad I am not the only one.
---
It's only the stress test so it's no big deal, but I hope they don't forget it for live release. I want my old zergling!
---
I have submitted a bug report and a ticket anyway.
---
downloading 1.10 on dialup was horrible, having to sit there and watch the little blood orb fill up for ages.
---
&gt;a threshold which, once you go below it, mobs are instantly respawned
---
So you could almost say that based on a certain dynamic conditions the mobs respawn.
---
The game was always like this at lower levels. As you get higher lvl the regen starts to be lower and lower (unless you stack spirit, which no one did in vanilla).
---
That's also the point that most old players said the game was ruined.
---
"run to a place all three of you" what?
---
He had just joined the server and wanted to level with us, not sure how we do that? In the end relogging worked but there should be a better way
---
i refused to buy gametime for it :D ill buy gametime an hour before the actual release :D hope you guys had fun!
---
This is actually good advice. While a lot of people were stuck on the first kobold quest in Northshire, I killed whatever I could reasonably target and destroy (mostly the worker kobolds, which were just hanging around 'cause the amount of people on that quest was much smaller). As the vermin respawned, I grabbed them up, too. And I killed the wolves that were hanging around if nobody else was actively trying to kill them.
---
This is more or less the foundation of the ABCs of leveling (Always Be Killing) and ensures you're not just wasting time. Obviously if the starting area is insanely packed, I would also recommend finding a group (because God knows you could wipe those kobold kill-10 quests out in a minute or two if you've got help), but if the live release is anything like last night, I had no trouble AT ALL getting my quests done, and I logged in more than an hour after the stress test started. Northshire was packed with people! 
---
But there were enough spawns of /something/ around for me to stay busy and engaged, which is not only a huge step up from the last stress test, but I actually found it fun. :)
---
Then play smarter.  Don't ask blizz to dumb down the game to make up for a group's lack of skill because they can't distinguish between valid PVP targets and civilians.
---
I missed the original auction. Still searching on Ebay for the EU Tyrande server...
---
this was a post cata change if I remember correctly. I remember walking through TB one day with probably near a thousand skeletons from the horde camp to the raid portal... It was incredibly laggy even after fighting had stopped. I suspect the game sees skeletons as client object rather than simply ground clutter like foliage but im not server/coder/lag expert enough to say.
---
You do, I reupped my sub yesterday and played  right away after downloading
---
Yea Retail SW is much prettier especially area around cathedral IMO.
---
Lol all I'm saying is his comment wasn't cringe, I'm  not part of the argument.
---
But that's an hour lost? Better buy the 1 second before release so Blizz don't scam you /s
---
Same here buddy. But fear not release will be so much better
---
1.12 the cap was 5 for all dungeons but BRS. That is the only one that allowed 10 in 1.12. It is authentic and not a bug. The content phase has nothing to do with this.
---
Your good man, I reupped yesterday and got in and played
---
I am forced to read german, they have done horrible things in the history of mankind and now ruins Classic, great

Despite the bottleneck at the quillboar cave in Mulgore, it was smooth sailing for the most part on my end. Got to lvl 11 before 9pm cdt, even with the servers down for an hour.
---
Cool. Maybe you have a more stereotypical gamer look.
---
Yeah, I tried that too. But in the orc starting zone EVERYTHING was getting killed.
---
Doesn‚Äôt seems so funny to me.. Just some random clips with music on it
---
Were you Horde or Alliance? I was Sleepwithme the human mage. =p
---
Yeah, that's why People in TBC were still able to raid most old dungeons with 10 people.
---
Who hurt you buddy ?
---
Even pservers which are generally a conglomeration of tryhards have not enough warriors.
---
You'd think they'd have figured it out that tanking lets you get away with so much stuff, but nope. Never enough 5men dungeon tanks.
---
It's too immersion breaking for me. The dialogue skips etc.
---
So many of those warriors will quit during leveling, its not even funny.
---
Set it to 1fps higher to avoid stutter and tear from it being just below.
---
Any higher and your GPU is just going to get hotter than it needs to for no benefit.
---
So aggressive. Zug Zug.
---

---
Me too friend!
---
I've never used this before. What are your favorite parts of it?
---
Thats too risky. Nice that im getting downvoted for not beeing willing to pay to test a game.  Blizzard could had made this an open stress test but yea, im the bad guy :D
---
Originally i made it for one of my videos, but tought others might want it as well. Here's the Download link:
---
https://www.mediafire.com/file/c43kcfvamobsg6o/WOWClassicBG.mp4/file
---
Same here, however I still have a slight suspicion that these respawn rates were put there for the stress test and they might not be the same for launch, but I am hopeful that's not the case.
---
He is wrong though. You can't lump them all together. Millennial's start in 1981. We still spent plenty of time outside. Had to physically be hanging out with someone to play a game with them. Games online wasn't really a thing I discovered until college.
---
It will be interesting. When I first played Vanilla I was Horde. But this guild I joined for Classic is a alliance guild so it‚Äôs going to be weird for me.

READ the patch notes. The cap change only applied to 4 dungeons and the 2007 video I linked proves it
---
Thanks for the input friend!
---
That you can basically adjust erything to your liking and still keep it minimalistic.
---
Why the fuck do people do this?  Just skip the quest lol.
---
in shooters etc sure, in wow your latency to the server will overwhelm vsync lag and make it basically un-noticeable.
---
Perhaps not, but there is more important issues than a level 15-20 dungeon. My guess, it has to do with the client that the game is being rebuilt on.
---
For  Blizzard to be kind and understand that no one will renew their subscription just for a couple of hours of classic
---
Yea im buying a game that is released and im allowed to play, i dont pay to test the game before its released..
---
My mistake, misread...
---
*50 players all crowding mobs/nodes/NPCs that you need, depriving you of the ability to play* "wow I can't believe people hate on us for having fun!!" 
---
Moron lol
---
Even if there are people who put people who cut lines on ignore, they'll realize in a couple of days that they don't care about that level 3 quest and remove them. 
---
Also, you don't seem to understand that alot of the people doing this are the same people who will be guild masters/officers/raiders in the faster guilds on the server, meaning the people who wants to join their guild won't care if they cut the line at level 3. 
---
Standing in line isn't my classic experience. Sure, in 2005 I did some RP things while leveling, but I also did shitty things to people like take chests when someone had cleared to it. It didn't affect my server reputation ... and it won't in 2019.
---
blizzard broke it(and similar addons) by removing spell id's from the combat log
---
Yes.. there are more important issues. But that still doesn't mean that a bug shouldn't be made known. I'm not sure what your point is here.
---
On the old 0.8 alpha client most of the spells have this great picture
---
Dude it wasn't an attack. Just an observation. And, look below, I have accepted it. I still think its a tiny thing to worry about in the long run of classic.
---
Here's a question and concern I have; how is progression on a Druid? I am tempted to go Warrior because getting near gear, weapon etc makes you feel stronger whereas on a Druid you don't really get that, unless I'm wrong.
---
Yeah but classic is easy and it's not like being a streamer means you're bad at the game either.
---
the subfolders are created on first login. but you can also manually create the same folders as on retail (interface/addons) and put the addons there.
---
You are seriously overestimating what Addons can do if you think that it's like playing BFA just without heirlooms.
---
A stupid player won't suddenly get better just because he has a few addons installed.
---
And where exactly is the difference between having a marker on the map or just knowing the location from memory because this is a 15-year-old game that you played for most of its time?
---
Quite frankly you should back off a little bit and just focus on your own gameplay if you don't want to use addons that's cool. But don't try to make it seem like it's Anti-Classic to use them.
---
I am capable of exploring and interacting with other people even with addons (which is what I did during the Stress Test.)
---
I played in a horde raiding guild in vanilla, we would have happily traded all our Shamans for Paladins and the progression advantage they gave alliance guilds.
---
In short, if you really, really want to raid, and be on the edge of raiding, go Alliance. 
---
If you want to raid, but are happy to be like 95% of the majority of guilds well behind the curve, then it really doesn‚Äôt matter.
---
If  40 man raiding isn‚Äôt of interest and you want to PvP, probably go Horde.
---
If you like RP, and like both genuine gender balance and diversity in your guild (both usually positives to good story based RP guilds), definitely go Alliance.
---
If your a tourist, it doesn‚Äôt matter what you choose, just enjoy yourself and have fun.

---
It has been made known ,after I have done some research I see it was brought up in this subreddit and in the official forums.
---
&gt;Classic will be a mix of mean people and awesome people, just like always.
---
Just this time there's no air of anonymity as you join a dungeon/raid, never to see those people again. Now we must deal with the reputations we ourselves build.
---
ModUI was a masterpiece but I think he stopped developing it about a year ago.
---
Back in Vanilla, if you wanted to stay in the same area, you might have to grind out a few levels between places. However, if you don't mind travelling, you can go somewhere new to do quests or bang out a few instances in between to get you leveled.
---
Please make this a toggle as I will not use an addon that makes me press a button everytime just to experience the game in the way I want. 
---
You can either reverse the control (so it only auto accepts while pressing) or make it a toggle. Otherwise I don't want it.. :P
---
This is basically the reason why I don't have autopilot either..
---
Is something that's worth a handful of silver really worth keeping for months? Even if you can double it?
---
In the early game, gold matters so much and is hard to get. But by late game, where gold is still valuable and matters, you can make 20,30,40 or more gold in just a single hour. As compared to a few silver in an hour in early game.
---
So, holding onto something for months to make a little more silver seems silly. 
---
Am I missing something or are wrong here?
---
Okay, this is really cute. I like how it looks like it's opening up to some magical awesome treasure (but we both know the only thing inside is a lonely little watermelon).

---
No. As long as you've made it attack rather than just cast a single firebolt (ctrl-1 instead of ctrl-4) it should keep casting, and did for me on the stress test.
---
Imp specifically seems to be working fine, other than defensive mode defending others who are in target, too. That's broken, but very minor.
---

Most exciting part for me is the reset in economy. Having copper and silver actually be relevant again. Being low on money and deciding what spells to train/upgrade and which to pass on. AH completely empty, ahhhhhh I can‚Äôt wait!

Hi, /u/Twitch_Yine
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/co1d5u/na_alliance_guild_recruiting_for_over_a_year_now/).
---
Make sure the addon folders are named correctly, that's what was keeping most of mine from working.
---
For whatever reason some of the ones I downloaded came with additional stuff in the names when I unzipped then (like "-master" at the end).
---
The actual answer if playing casually is yes.
---
There will be many times where you run out of quests in your immediate vicinity for your level. It mostly means that you missed some in another area, or you should be moving to a new zone.
---
For example later in Silverpine forest as an undead, you will straight up run into a wall after like lvl 14-17 (not sure exactly), if you try to only stay in silverpine. You should either grind or move to the Barrens (latter being the option most players take).
---
But if you are playing casually and didn't know about this, you might just end up having to grind. 
---
In general though, look up a list of level appropriate zones for your level and faction, and if you run into this issue, simply go to one of the other zones if you want to quest and not grind.
---
So in the Silverpine example you can go to barrens. In your example, you could take the Zepplin to org and go south (normally I wouldn't do that but it's up to you).
---
You could of course also look at some leveling guide such as Joannas, scroll to your race and level, and see where he recommends questing. But i have found that once you start using a leveling guide it's hard to stop... so that's at your own peril.
---
I had mine, but the "walking" noises they made were constant and LOUD.
---
I wonder what asshole has my shitty server.
---

---
I think you need to look up what spam means.
---
Level in a feral build whilst collecting int/spirit gear from quests when there aren't agility/strength ones for feral available. You can still heal dungeons regardless of spec whilst you are levelling, it's more the gear that counts. In fact, feral gets heart of the wild later on which will boost your intellect in caster form which also helps!
---

"haha it's a thing i don't like/understand why people like so im gonna type cringe as a comment"
---
Tier 1 and 2 are more suited for PVP and odd grinding than raiding. We did use 8/8 T1 paladin gear in one NAXX boss that prevents you from normally healing more than once every minute. T1 heals your group when you hit a mob (and it doesnt count as a heal).
---
So as a holy pally you will be using dresses until NAXX and Tier 3.
---
I was about to ask how big your five year old is but then I remembered we are the ones who have to live next to gnomes.
---
Touche sir.
---
I had a ton more fun in this last stress test than stress test 2. Small changes like this don‚Äôt bother me. 
---
Stress test 2 I stopped leveling and ran around because I couldn‚Äôt kill anything. This time I got o level 6 after about 1-2 hours playing in the undead zone.
---
Real men do it without a guide to spoon-feed you
---
is this 1920x1080?  needs to be a wallpaper..  and possibly animated

Seconding this. If you make more, I'm in the market.
---
!remindme 20 days
---
I assume you're talking about Feral Tanking.
---
Yeah, you won't get the same gear progression. You don't use tier, you use mostly off-pieces, a lot of odd pre-60 items etc. So it's not as cool as a warrior rolling around with full tier gear.
---
But Druid items are really "powerful", so while you'll get new gear less often, they will offer massive buffs when you do get them.
---
Oh you‚Äôll be wearing cloth alright - just wait and see how many healing plate pieces you actually find
---
What is the reason? Just curious.
---
True!
---
Hard to define a strict limit to where it stops being grey if we to down that slope though. üòÅ
---
Unfortunately, the initial goal for this addon was to use it with a good guide and get to 60 asap so i didnt think a toggle would be necessary.
---
Toggling it on or off would be easy, but building the UI to do it takes time and im not sure itll be ready before stress test ends :S
---
A ton of people started there subscription yesterday to play. A lot more then no one lol.
---
Its the same folder structure as retail, its interface/addons... Classic will make that folder when you first launch it.
---
WHY!!!!! WHO CREATED SUCH AN ABOMINATION
---
You might have say 10-20% less dps as long as you have good gear but not BiS.
---
But if you know the fight or you don't clip dots or you stand in the right place you might already make up some of that difference.
---
I would take 2 out of imp sw:p and put it into imp mind blast
---
But they fixed it for this test.
---
Ya took my bag luck! I got zero bags to almost level 11.
---
This is so sick, need this with wallpaper engine.
---
Not gonna lie, I just stood there in the Fargodeep Mine and watched a Lvl 6 Rogue die to two Kobold last night, because I needed the dust and candles.
---
...about 5 minutes later I had one extra respawn show up on me after a tough fight. I frantically ran around trying to get one of the 20 nearby players to help. They were all preoccupied.
---
After running half way through the mine with about 10hp  I assumed the kobold bastard was leashing back to his spawn. I was dead wrong.

Nothing in bags and i dont think i had any incoming mail either. But they DID say previously that you will not get those in stress tests (in test 1 &amp; 2 at least).
---
Hmm a good and fitting name.
---
In SWG people would line up for buffs.
---
This is the truth! I started getting sucked into the game and then realized that the character wasn‚Äôt permanent, so fuck it. Next time around nothing will be keeping me back from getting sucked in....
---
I seriously thought nostalgia would carry me probably to level 20, but I was legit having a blast with my friends fighting over mobs with others.

Back in the day I had a Dwarf Hunter named Bloodnokk and I had already made my mind up that I wanted a Turtle pet.
---
Well, the only turtles I knew about where in the Barrens, so as soon as I completed my level 10 class quest I started to run over to Ironforge, tram to Stormwind, and began the already-pretty-difficult run to Duskwood... ready to run through STV, boat to bootie bay... You get the picture.  Relatively fresh server so there were no 60 guildies to escort me, but it wasn't first week so there were plenty of Horde in STV.  
---
Me &amp; a RL friend grouped up at Darkshire, both about level 12.  Must've taken about 4 hours to get through STV, it was ridiculous.  Oh my god the corpse runs - but it was SO MUCH FUN.  
---
We ended up a group of about 10 strangers, some to scare away horde gankers, others to take aggro from the creeps I was pulling from a mile away.  I think we might've done the final third in one shot, as we finally got our little group organized enough to keep me safe.  
---
I didn't even level that damn hunter past about 30, but it's one of my fondest non-60 memories of the game.
---
Arguably the sci-fi elements were beginning to be established as early as Warcraft 3, which first characterized Warcraft‚Äôs demons as an army that traveled between worlds. For that matter, the orcs themselves were originally established as coming from another world.

WoW wound up treading deeper into sci-fi territory as it started fleshing out more details of the cosmos and how different factions were navigating it.

Like the other guy said; all you gotta do to heal dungeons while leveling is collect +int and if you can +spelldmg/healing gear. Obviously you‚Äôll have to understand how downranking spells works and how to heal but besides that you really don‚Äôt need to be resto to heal leveling dungeons.
---
Lol that guy that asked him how he levels so fast and his answer, 
---
"I'm good."
---
Typical 12yo edgy kid comment.
---
Druids are fun but it depends on your play style.  Druids and Shaman can be similar the main difference i noticed between the two the way I play is the druid has less downtime.  Maybe if you only used mana to heal and drop totems on the shaman I could have minimized downtime but its fun to burst stuff down with shocks and crits.
---
All dungeons as of 1.3 had a player cap of 10
---
Dire Maul was added with a player cap of 5
---
Patch 1.10 reduced the player cap of BRD, Strat and Scholo to 5

Hope that clears it up

Alt rigth viewpoints are in no way isolated to German gamers. In my personal experience they are very much a minority in German communities and usually shunned. Speaking as a German here. 
---
On the other hand, speaking German online usually brings people calling you a Nazi out of the woodwork ;)
---
Well, I know for me, when I was playing originally, that my parents‚Äô computer couldn‚Äôt handle addons since it could barely handle wow. Part of me wants to replicate that original experience
---
For solo levelling I think you want bestial wrath first, but I only played a hunter starting in WotLK.
---
I think you should choose whichever faction you prefer. If you're heavily into PvP and looking to go premades and aim for some serious PvP ranks you might want to go ally. Otherwise just causual, general open world PvP i'd go horde all the way.

- skip any named mob until you get to Thousand Needles pretty much. :)
---
Classic wow is a finished, available product when and only when it launches. Not wanting to pay for a beta, which is none of that, is entirely reasonable.
---
I switched to Luna Unit Frames
---
Thank you for the breakdown, I appreciate this a lot.
---
I think realistically my playstyle will likely be heavily PvP focused with some 5 mans and possibly a bit of raiding but nothing too serious.
---
Honestly I reckon it's going to come down to the very last minute and go one way or the other. I just want to enjoy the experience regardless!
---
Most streamers have less than 20 viewers. Its the ones that have an entire stadium of people watching that effect if the most.
---
Source?
---
I will be in the 2nd week... and I am ok with it... everything you wrote about is true. While yes you will be behind; your first week of progress will be faster than theirs.
---
Hakurai's 1-60 guide is excellent and very basic, I highly recommend using it.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akqzzAA7F08&amp;list=PLiIDj0gsjp3Ci8YDgs12T83TWYvzQymHn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akqzzAA7F08&amp;list=PLiIDj0gsjp3Ci8YDgs12T83TWYvzQymHn)
---
Is wallpaper engine good or does it just hammer your resources? Like do you use this while gaming or is it something you just run while idling/doing other stuff?
---
For reference I have an Ryzen 7 2700X and a MSI 1070
---
Nope, I will be plodding along like a sloth with ADHD. Ohhhh look over there!
---
You are not sensible
---
Exactly, it's a European server, ergo English should be the only language allowed in public channels.
---
Which is entirely fair m8. The industry has gone to such shit and the community is thus uses to bullshit, to the extend that they will actually defend this shit. It‚Äôs abhorrent that they‚Äôve charged for now just one but two betas now, as well as stress tests and name reservations. Fanbois will make up all sorts of idiotic excuses, but it could (and should) all be done without charging us for beta products.
---
I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree, since we both feel strongly that we're both right, I didn't bother spending ¬£9.99 to get into this stress test, so I can't really continue this debate further.
---
One last point I will make, is ignoring everything else I said, health bar update can only take place every 400ms (up to 3 times per second) since that's the frequency of batch cycles, so it's going to be delayed regardless.
---
No, it's not an offense and you are not entitled to only seeing English in a European server.
---
People hated my Model M - every time I push-to-talked on Vent they heard a very loud clicketty click clack in the background of me mashing heroic strike.
---
Loved that keyboard, silver logo from sept 1991. Two keys stopped working last year aft many years of service. Incidentally I broke the spring on the F5 key too so it was working but depressed. 
---
Replaced by das keyboard ultimate, great keyboard
---
/u/Beardharmonica
---
You were SO sure that I was wrong and "just wanted to argue".
---
:)
---
If you were running away then the leeway mechanic extended their range out. It‚Äôs very hard to run away without a root/slow or using some environment piece to hang the mob up.
---
It's significant, but not the end of the world.
---
&gt;Nothing matters unless you're wiping :tm:
---
You can run south from the valley of trials, through the gap in the wall for the shaman class quest. Jump in the water and die, Rez at spirit healer. Run to X-roads and get FP and a skinning knife, then run south to golden road, die and Rez at camp taurajo. Can get skinning there. (May need to test the death zones for spirit healers), then hearth back to valley of trials. 
---
It‚Äôs as quick as going to Org, but you get some FP‚Äôs and some early exploration XP.
---
Just type /luna
---
They only published the end date (Friday, so today)  but no end time. Its most likely ending around 4pm pst to match the last test.
---
So they fix this bug, will they fix Hunter Scatter Shot + Ice Trap bug? This bug wasn't there originally in Vanilla but was introduced in later patches and then fixed again in pre-TBC patch.
---
There is a save option.
---
Whats your name going to be?
---
August 13th is name reservation day.
---
/chatter worked for me. I downloaded almost everything from willitclassic.com so for Chatter that meant [wow interface](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info24969-ChatterClassicquickfix.html)
---
On the stress test, the respawns were cranked up pretty high.
---
That stress test made me get a boner for Classic. So glad it was everything I hoped it would be!
---
Kind of strange that some are reporting they have them, and others aren't.
---
Coincidentally, looking at posting history, it seems US players have them but EU don't. Could be a regional thing. Can any EU players confirm they got their CE pets?
---
Hope they have this sorted by release!
---
I think by powershifting he means quickly changing between cat/bear/humanoid form to make the most of all your abilities. Druids were pretty useless as bear or cat alone.
---
PvE in classic was resto or nothing basically.
---
Druids scale pretty well with gear imo because the different forms multiply your stats so a few points of stam and armor will be more noticeable.  Also healing makes it easier to level.  One thing I like about druid is you can decide if you want to pull 3 mobs and grind them down in bear form or you can stealth past them in cat form and kill the one quest mob or get the quest item and move on.
---
That monitor is pretty high end
---
What UI are you using here? I very much like it.
---
Does it work???
---
If you're PvPing, just roll Horde imo. Warstomps value can't be put in words, it's that good. Fighting Pallies is much easier than fighting Shamans. The R10 set looks fantastic.
---
Type /ar or /allyroute in chat...
---
This will show the [-] and [+] button that allow you to resize the window and the font size.
---
This is explained in the download page and the addon itself.
---
I had zero issues during the stress test, granted I have a pretty highend rig and great internet. But even with more players than I could count, I didn‚Äôt experience a single instance of lag or stuttering. Very impressed, can‚Äôt wait for the 27th!
---
thanks god for this, you have to be an absolute retard to play on a streamer server. like really a retard.
---
One thing to keep in mind going aimed shot over bestial wrath is you‚Äôll have to worry much more about weapon speed while leveling. Options are already limited for good ranged weapons without being too incentivized to find a slow one.
---
Thex, Thux, Thix, Thos, Thax 
---
The multibox gang.
---
All my addons (when I had to update them) said they were compatable with classic. Can‚Äôt say for sure they work since I haven‚Äôt played classic yet
---
Damn, guess I'm a retard for wanting to be around as many other players as possible and being part of my favorite streamer's world then...
---
He at least bans racists and bigoted remarks now
---
17 for Americans ;)
---
Man I want to play right now but I'm stuck at work and I have to go out for dinner tonight... le sigh.
---
This is correct. I keep the list pretty short on the site, because the truth is there will be streamers on every realm. It's about avoiding the most potentially impactful streamers on your experience.
---
I'm hesitant to add every streamer to the list because it may push away new players by making them discouraged thinking that every realm will be ruined. I want to give people knowledge to make a decision based on what streamers will be most potentially impactful on their  gameplay experience and not scare them away.
---
Ye True !
---
Noice
---
You are totally right, I can do that. I was hoping to squeeze it into one key for efficiency.
---
no melee will interupt that spell, its a spell you use when people are running or moving los. like tunnel in WSG for example.
---
Looks like ElvUi
---
You can show \# in a comment by typing
---
    \ followed by an \#
---
Okay, figured.
---
Powershifting is a very different thing, basically shifting in and out of cat form during boss fights in order to increase your energy regen - and thus DPS.
---
If you're going to level super casually you don't care if you're losing 15 minutes to setting up addons...
---
I wish we Europoors had unemployment checks that one can survive on...
---
Not really (I downvoted) üëø
---
And the all caps of your comment made me downvote you as well üôÑ
---
Has that worked for you on the stress test? I tried shorter reset times it just makes the macro freeze. You are totally right the 30 is just an arbitrary number I picked.
---
The scifi stuff is imho just emulation of wh40k lore where the "warhammer fantasy battle planet" was originally just one planet in the wh40k galactic map. Similarly I guess they wanted to unite star craft universe with warcraft, as there originally was a concept of space orcs.
---
https://starcraft.fandom.com/wiki/Orc
---
You are not alone. Blizzard is just ignoring this fact. They put in some low-effort recreations of the color schemes and the lighting of the original 1.12 client. It looks good enough for the normies.
---
We aren't talking about any one specific server here...
---
On the PvE side you get more of that "jack-of-all-trades" vibe from Druid. The 0/30/21 HoTW/NS druid build can tank or heal dungeons (with the caveat that you can't resurrect). It's more realistic that you would hot-swap roles as a druid mid-dungeon by popping barkskin/tranquility if the healer is disabled or shifting to bear if the tank dies, whereas shamans are mostly dedicated healers. They run out of mana far too fast to really switch roles between damage and healing, whereas the druid changes resources entirely. This is also mostly true in PvP.
---
If we're talking about more long-term role throttling ‚Äî being a dedicated support one day and a dedicated nuker the next, Shaman has Druid beat. Shaman can put out some really scary burst damage when properly tuned whereas Boomkin is a meme and Feral is more of an attrition fighter. Shamans are also far more desirable pocket healers because of their extremely powerful totem buffs (windfury) and spam-able group heal, although because of innervate Druid can be a better match with something like a mage.
---
So tl;dr if you want more mid-fight role swapping go Druid, if you want more high-end potential and burst go Shaman.
---
&gt; After Stress Test 2 
---
So no, they fixed it after the test.
---
I‚Äôm not lol do you lack so much human interaction that this comes off as worked up? I‚Äôm laughing at the thought of people waiting in lines, I‚Äôm far from worked up üòÇ
---
SP brings much more good than ret, 2/10
---
Fair enough. ^^
---
I had it running perfectly on a super old computer with a GT 1030, easily the best ¬£2.99 I've ever spent. You can keep it running in the background if you want but I have it pause whenever I play games. Now that I've got an actual PC I can keep it running while playing games. It's incredibly lightweight.
---
Now do a horde one please
---
"large"... Large would be something like raiding zg with 40 players. That's about as small as it can get.
---
You may be right, it likely is much better for a 1v1 than a group situation but I'm sure I can fuck up some healers day by spamming it. I wont really know how effective it is until I play Classic :/
---
Love that, but unfortunately when I was doing that quest  yesterday, it looked nothing like that :(
---
You can change quite a few settings to reduce load. But it's not a lot anyways. About 30% of gpu load but at very clocks not much above idle clock speed for me with a vega 64.
---
That‚Äôs what you think. Luckily you are not an authority in any matter
---
which version of ace3 do you use?
---
It's super smooth now. And bookmarked, thank you!
---
So from Elwyn forest to StV - boat to Aberdeen. Walk there not too epic, right?

u guys can add me if u want c: loksins#2197

---
yes! It was supposed to last exactly 24 hours. So that'll be 8pm Warsaw Time for me.
---
&gt; Jesus you are actually hopeless.. It does not say that no, it only says that if you are straight up stupid and try to find reasons to support your own stupididy. 
---
This violates rule 2 of this sub reddit.  You should learn how to converse with people without resorting to insults.
---
&gt; There is no dot, there is no line change, it is not a new sentence "And" literally means it is a follow up to the sentence before, saying that "As soon as they hit 60" 
---
There is a comma which separates the two from one another.  You have listed multiple "reasons" why someone would want enchants, not one reason as separated by the comma.  It is basic English.  Here is an example:   I like wine and cheese.  Which means I like wine and cheese together.  I like wine, and cheese.  Which means I like both wine and cheese which may be separate from one another not exclusively combined with one another.  Welcome to English, have a good time!
---
I was referring to the queues times that probably doesnt matter be horde or alliance because the shared bg servers, but ya my mistake replying to you :)
---
Yeah I think I bamboozled myself a bit with all the different sources. I used a google doc with links, and several different sites, and in the end lost the overview of where I got which AddOn from.
---
This is what I did
---
    #showtooltip Judgement
---
    /cast [harm] Judgement
---
    /cast Seal of Righteousness(Rank 1)
---
It will judge and cast the seal in the same GCD.  If you don't have the seal up, it will still cast it.  I made the icon look like the seal, but put judgement as the showtooltip so you can see the cooldown and tell when you are in range.
---
Do you know how many arguments I got into on private servers with people who insisted that dynamic spawns weren't "blizzlike"? Take that, jerks!
---
This looks fantastic!
---
Are there any good working threat meter addons? I remember that i used to have omen in vanilla.
---
I have a guide for you.
---
Step 1: Take quest
---
Step 2: Complete quest
---
When in doubt: Kill mob
---
Repeat until you get level 60. If you are in need of more in-depth guides what to do after level 60, don't be afraid to contact me.
---
Best regards: Me
---
&gt;but there should be a better way
---
why
---
&gt; It‚Äôs thanks to private servers that you‚Äôre able to play Classic.
---
No, it's thanks to a few Blizzard employees doing a large amount of work that we're able to play real Classic. Private servers may very well be driven by "passion for the game", but they're still breaking international copyright law and should be treated as such.
---
You'll need the `/run` at the start.  Also not sure if I might've broken other things -- just rewriting to explain.
---
Shut up incel
---
&gt;Dominos
---
Thank god for that
---
But it's not? It doesn't classify as a dynamic feature and Blizzard them selves didn't want to call it dynamic.
---
Either your apm is off the charts, or youre running in circles lul
---
I didn't test it in the stress test... because paladins only press 3 buttons on every mobs so I don't really need to macro it.
---
Seal of the Crusader, then Judgement, then Seal of Righteousness (or Seal of Command at level 20), and you auto attack the mob till it dies.
---
But I do know that's how the macro should look like in retail. And classic is using the same macro system as retail.
---
Haha. That post wording 
---
Want to tank? You can heal 
---
Want to DPS? You can heal 
---
Hahaha
---
I just got traded some cloth bracers after buffing someone with fort.
---
Mark Kern also reported the missing dynamic respawn as a bug in the first stress test.
---
This. Level separately until crossroads and then go together then. It will save alot of time in the long run
---
Brevity is the soul of wit.
---
You notice that usually the long-winded, ranty posts often get the most downvotes?
---
KUI works pretty well, i also found this sweet one called Nugrunning on Warcraft tavern. It tracks your buffs in a nice bar and then debuffs on enemys with a bar over theirs. Give it a whirl.
---
You won't wear cloth during leveling. There are nearly no healing pieces while leveling and clothies will be very irate, when you roll on non healing items.
---
You will wear cloth during most of your raiding times as there are very few plate healing pieces in the game with the exception of the T3 set and the T1 set (the T1 isn't optimal for healing though.
---
There are 18 other plate pieces with +healing in the game. 6-8 of those are also not very good, due to spending a lot of stat budget on strength and agility.
---
There will be this much traffic.  Layering was in fact functioning and I watched groups move in and out of my layer in the Tauren area.  The quantity of people you actually seen on screen was far less than what was actually there.
---
Warfronts?
---
[https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1754107903](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1754107903)
---
Whoahoho, that's super interesting. So for those "batch exploit" builds where you equip 2 of the same item to trick the server into thinking you're attacking more than you actually are, there's gonna need to be some kind of "batch tracker" addon that times everything with a 400ms repeating clock!
---
They haven't "just implemented a system". They fixed a bug that was preventing the existing 1.12 and previous dynamic spawns from activating in Classic.
---
Yeah, that's true, if you play often, but my friends and i don't have much time to really play so some of us don't even use up the 30 hours, and none of us use more than 60 lol
---
This is good info but you probably should've taken the high road vs. being petty.
---
Just make a macro and key bind it to shit up key
---
talking ?
---
You mean screaming.
---
It's literally Vanilla.
---
Is forsen actually going to play? Like is he really going to get past wailing caverns
---
This is what I‚Äôm happy to see! Sometimes I ask myself if people that haven‚Äôt played older versions of WoW will appreciate them like those who have.
---
AIM lol

I know its probably not a huge deal, but this may need a NSFW tag.

If you aren‚Äôt on the desktop screen it‚Äôll pause animation to reduce load

Welcome to the real World (of Warcraft)
---
Yeah I noticed this too on a mage I was trying. Felt really weird after 1.12 servers
---
I imagine the worst will be doing the first harpy quest since there are so few of them. Might be worth skipping.
---
Wow remember mice used to have the tracking balls? Have to take them out and clean the lint dirt and hair off. Oh the days
---
11pm on the 26th
---
How do you **revert camera back to normal** though?
---
Its global so Google  WoW launch and then find your time zone.
---
and we always thought he was the war chief. What a twist! and that despite #nochanges
---
They wouldn't ban you for racisim but they might ban you for idiocy.
---
We're all brothers and sisters in Classic now, retail player.
---
By then it will be over :(
---
Of course, but it happens way less with DHKs in.
---
How is PVE in classic resto or nothing? Leveling as resto is significantly harder than feral. Healing dungeons can be done as any spec as long as you have the gear for it, so being a druid makes you extremely flexible when looking for dungeon groups regardless of spec. I've never played balance so I can't speak to it, but I assume you can level with it as well, but even I have to admit it probably won't be efficient... but neither is the entirety of warrior leveling.
---
Not trying to be hostile or anything, but PVE is not just raiding and I'd rather not have some new person reading this thread and thinking they can't play balance or feral at all unless they are running a flag. Plus for a casual person that wants to get in a casual guild that runs MC and Ony every week, they'll be fine with almost any spec.
---
I always did them with 5 anyways. Also what does GM stand for gaming minotaur?
---
Those of us who actually played and remember Vanilla know this, but for some reason private server players mistakenly believe that Vanilla didn't have dynamic spawns. I have no idea why they thought this but they treated it as gospel.
---
I have no problem with people trying to find engaging and quick things to do in classic wow. 
---
Just know that people will be jumping onto classic wow to seek social systems that pop up organically like this.
---
 RemindMe! 1 day
---
Three days is more than enough time.
---
I voted Barrens chat for the lulz
---
[Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of The Windseeker]
---
If you don't know that there's a bug, you're going to assume the system is working correctly.
---
I'm sure this is a dumb question, and Google didn't help me out.  How do I set this as my desktop wallpaper?
---
Played for like 16m ! Totally fun and can‚Äôt wait for release !!!
---
I got a half o lined up just for launch week
---
That Tuesday in work is gonna be dogshit
---
If you can totem twist you will be welcome in any group.
---
Fight multiple mobs at a time to feed you rage.
---
There's times I'll leave a 10% HP mob on me attacking me while I fight others JUST to feed me rage.
---
Damn I can't imagine never playing WoW until BFA and then switching to Classic. That must be such a trip. Literally going from the absolute worst version of the game to the best
---
I know :( 
---
Good thing is we get full release in 16 days so I got that going for me which is nice. ;)
---
I would at most do 2 points into Imp MB. Unless you‚Äôre running premades, Imp SW:P will be much easier to use and net you a lot more impact by multidotting the other team. You really really don‚Äôt want to hardcast MB and get locked out of shadow by an interrupt. Mana burn will be your best friend in pvp.
---
Thought T1 pally was Banana Man?
---
Because Discord is spyware run by furries. Everyone using discord for "free" is a fool.
---
Maybe I can do some convincing!
---
It has all the awesome functions of a bunch of addons, sell junk, easy quest accept, easy dismount, auto need for ZG, quick auto follow and other things that it can do.
---
I completely agree, I also don't find it unreasonable to put the stress test behind a sub. It would make it much more suspectible to DDOS and inaccuracy of numbers. Im on the fence, just don't like people feeling entitled to a free beta
---
Nah
---
No thank you.
---
Skinning is defenitely a good choice for leveling.
---
LW you probably won't Level while leveling - also you can get most (I think all actually) good items from other Leatherworkers. They are not soulbound nor do you Need LW Skill in order to wear it.
---
I would go skinning and some other collecting Profession (mining or herb) for the extra Money. Engi you won't be skilling while leveling either so you might as well get some extra Gold in for later when things actually sell on the AH...
---
Leather is great raw Gold for leveling so no AH needed with that really which is a big + for getting a mount
---
It's actually kind of beneficial in vanilla. Quests are plentiful but there's definitely not as many as there are now. You can sustain a healthy xp/hr on some groups of mobs, especially if they're unrelated to popular questlines. Of course don't feel obligated to grind on mobs in every zone.
---
Troll really isnt a popular race. Its the least popular on Horde. That said, Orc is most popular, with Forsaken slightly behind
---
I use a wireless mouse and keyboard.
---
Sk/LW works great for a fresh start.
---
Engi needs alot of gold to level, even more gold of a fresh realm because of the lack of mats on the AH. And you need to save the gold to get your mount at 40.
---
And yes Skinning while leveling and vendoring is the go to way of making money early on.
---
This is the keyboard that roaches will use to rebuild the world after a nuclear holocaust.
---
This literally took you longer to write than it would have to quickly google it for him :D
---
I understand that the pallypower isn't coming back. Does anyone know of an addon alternative that allows a raid leader or raid assist with the addon to assign blessings. Paladin 1 do blessing A. Paladin 2 do blessing B. Paladin 3 do blessing D. and everyone with the addon can see everyone's assignment. I know that weak auras can show whether the buff is up or not. I just need something to make raid blessing assignment easier to manage. Name ideas.
---
That is still possible because people haven't learned the consequences yet. Things become different when you have to find groups and people just remember you from the shitty things you did while leveling.
---
I want to help but you seem to be a sadistic twat,
---
Streamers are crap
---
i made a female on stress test last night that i think is the look im going for
---
it trully looks like a male tauren just skinnier. i love it
---
I have to ask, why is this three minutes long?
---
U dont need to üòäüëç
---
Do you want to blow people up in BGs or run the flag? Do you want to heal and drop totems or heal and innervate and constantly buff everyone?
---
Okay that was a kinda bad comparison both classes have plenty of fun stuff in them.
---
Yeah the skip to Ratchet works, you can even die about 2 meters outside of ratchet to get to crossroads. If there is definitely a skinner and trade goods vendor at Crossroads this would easily be the fastest way to get skinning sorted, it'll take you about 2 mins to get there and you can hearth back to Durotar.  
---
If you would like i've got a video on how to do the skip so just use that up to the crossroads part.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dr64cXZ4stI&amp;t=1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dr64cXZ4stI&amp;t=1s)
---
Leveling is a mix. As a paladin you will probably have gear from all armor types in your healing set. Just take whatevers got the most +healing and +int. You will look kinda clownsuity but so does everyone else in the leveling process.
---
The problem with the questions you are asking is "do fine" is subjective. Will your raid wipe and die because you aren't wearing optimal gear? Probably not. But will you be carrying your weight? Also no. Other healers will be forced to work harder to cover for you, and if the guild does have problems progressing it may wind up being (at least in part) because you aren't matching up.
---
Imo, if youve never played WoW then below is my advice.
---
-don't play the first 3 days. Youll get the same experience without the giant amount of players in the starting areas.
---
-enjoy leveling up, you'll see a bunch of threads about racing to 60 but leveling in Vanilla is amazing.
---
-Vagash is a better villian then Hogger. He doesnt have an army protecting him. Fight me on it
---
Went around buffing people with Power Word :Fortitude , was buffed by random strangers as well.
---
Also killed some things , but mostly buffs.
---
10/10 will play again.
---
It's literally dynamic spawns. The rare of spawning changes based on player population and players killing mobs and looting items. Just because the implementation is different from what private servers called dynamic spawns doesn't mean they're not dynamic.
---
I don't want to make the french language bad... but seriously... CHEF DE GUERRE?!
---
Sylvanas' title on the other hand sounds like german. I think I have to play in french this time, it sounds like fun!
---
Where did you download it from? The version I have doesn't work even with that.
---
Well it would be - but Blizzard would want you to buy another subscription for that .D
---
the fact we're not seeing any pictures of this setup tells me all I need to know
---
1. I wouldn't say it's a grind in the same was to RS/OSRS because it's 90% questing, rather than repeatedly killing the same thing. Quests are great though. It's grind-ish but without the repetitiveness 
---
2. Play what appeals to you, because ultimately, a lot of players will never hit 60 because they get bored. Play a class you personally feel resonates with you rather than a 'meta' class. All classes have their place in the game, it should be what you think is coolest.
---
Guilds won't be a problem, you'll find one. So generally speaking, yes, you should play classic :D
---
1. Sure, your progress will just be extra slow compared to others
---
2. Yes, not as bad as previous older MMORPGs though.
---
3. They're all great, but be weary of Shaman/Druid/Paladin. You'll likely be requested to Heal in raids, but outside of that you can do whatever you want.
---
4. Thousands to choose from.
---
Wireless internet I heard.
---
No one is needing to join but have been fun if someone came tho üòäüëç
---
I probably will never have time to raid unless by accident or in super casual PUG mode long after the early rush. But I like small group leveling and dungeon grinding and just open world solo stuff and at very low levels Druid feels really nice for this. Does the value of the class last into higher levels for random solo play and small groups? I‚Äôve never played Vanilla or Druid at all and was sort of fixed on Pally for my first character but now after playing Tauren Druid a bit in the stress test I‚Äôm really tempted to make that my first character for launch.
---
I am pretty sure there are spells which don't reset auto attack timer, like paladin judgement and shaman shocks
---
This is amazing but I can't help but feel bad for the 3 fellows up front waving their weapons around at what.... smoke and fire clouds?
---
This is insane :D great job
---
The servers seem dead, no?   What time does it end?
---
I didn‚Äôt read any of that 
---
Yes, you should
---
Since that‚Äôs literally what he said and you still seem unsure I would like to confirm again that is indeed the case
---
If you just play through the entire night, you should be able to call your boss about 4:30-5:00am to call in sick at a time that is convincing.
---
It really depends on your definition for what grey is. The definition for achromatic greys is all colors in which the RGB (red, green, and blue) values are exactly equal. Others may define grey as everything on the color-axis between black and white. Both are not wrong. It quickly gets philosophic, just like the question if grey (or black or white) are colors.
---
I made a video for PvE that answers this question which should be fine for PvP but I can give you my list of pre-bis for PVP at 60 that I'll be using real quick. Stuff that's easy to get and not too rng / time sink'ish.

I figured I wouldn't make a video on this as "starter pvp" gear is quite niche since there won't even be a point to PvP in phase 1 really, but here you go!
---
If you want the PvE version of this list just google my name and I have a video on the subject on youtube. Should be the first result.
---
This seems far less readable than the person who posted it originally.
---
I‚Äôd totally be down for a Starcraft/Warcraft crossover. Warcraft 40k when?
---
Raided as a Druid on a private server.  There is definitely a high skill cap.  You can spec regrowth (more performant) or healing touch.  Most will choose healing touch because it‚Äôs easier and less expensive (consumable wise).  Choosing ranks and trying to do your best heals per second is not boring in raid situations as a Druid.  That being said I‚Äôd imagine it‚Äôs very similar as a Shaman as well.
---
[enemy cast bar](https://lmgtfy.com/?q=wow+classic+enemy+cast+bar)
---
I don't see why you would use cloth while leveling. A mail/plate helmet of the owl is exactly the same as a cloth hood of the owl. There is no reason to use cloth unless it's an upgrade or you and nobody else wants it.
---
Well, if you want to go for a full plate healing set, you'd be looking at this before t3 in naxxramas:
---
Head: T2 helm, this is very good in phase 1, but is eclipsed by mc mail drop in phase 2 already (-10 +heal) and a cloth drop off azuregos (-60 +heal)
---
Shoulders: You'll go with the Dawnbringer Shoulders, which you can upgrade to desert crusade in phase 5. But leather shoulders from molten core are better than both of these.
---
Chest: That's where it's worst. Your only options are T1 and T2 chest. Both of which get completely destroyed by a cloth robe from Stratholme. (-40 +heal). 
---
Wrist: doesn't really matter, because you don't see them anyway. But funnily enough, that's a spot, where you can use palte without much trouble. green bracers from Dire Maul are really good and are outclassed by cloth bracers in AQ40.
---
Hands: Once you reach phase 4, this is primetime for plate, as the peacekeeper gauntlets from ZG are really good. Before that you have to use T1 or T2, which are quite weak compared to cloth options.
---
Waist: This is ok, you can get a good palte belt from scholo in phase 2, which isn't that mcuh worse than the cloth optinos and a really good one in aq40.
---
Legs: Also pretty good. T2 legs, peacekeeper legs and blazing light in aq40 is a nice progression curve. Though some cloth leggings from BWL outclass T2 quite hard.
---
Feet: Difficult, you have some good options, but a pair of cloth boots from bwl outclass those plate pieces hard.
---
So in total, you have serious downgrades in 4 of the 8 slots, moderate downgrades in 2-3 slots, 1-2 slots with no or minor downgrade. Unfortunately the msot visible slots (helm, chest, shoulders) are ones with major downgrades. You can do it absolutely, many holy paladins in vanilla refused to wear cloth. But you must be clear about, that it will hurt your healing ability noticeably.
---
This is so wholesome.
---
Hahaha never heard that term but pretty much.
---
Anub is up for 2500 right now on ebay. Anvilmar was also not one of the original in 2004. Goes for less, it was a low pop.
---
More like Brits queues master race. Hate to say this but compared to us, filthy Frenchmen, those Rosbeef know how to queue.
---
üï¥üèª
---
I thought that was a druid feature?  
---
Or my old timer memory remembers something like this that screwed druids over.
---
None of the run animations are satisfying in vanilla, except for NE. Tauren aren't horrible. Everything else feels real jerky and jumpy, but what are you gonna do? 
---
I do love the human animations though. I raided BC as horde and always took Deviant Delight with me for the human casting animations. Made up for the stick-up-ass running animations.
---
The album is around 85 minutes. The tracks on the album all have placeholder times
---
Ah yeah, but where does it say they fixed it for test 3. I mean they do state they verified it works now but I find their wording a bit vague.  
---
&gt; We have verified that we‚Äôve correctly reproduced the 1.12 spawn rates  and thresholds **throughout the game now,** and while the respawn rates you  see in Northshire aren‚Äôt the same as they are in Un‚ÄôGoro, they will both  be accurate to patch 1.12. 
---
I mean you can probably assume they did but why didn't they just state "in test 3 we have verified the fix" or somesuch.
---
"Being petty" ? The other guy was repeatedly saying I'm wrong and even accusing me of "just being there to argue".
---
Ye ive seen that and read that it is complicated but i just want something that from BFA interested me and i think it would be fun
---
I don‚Äôt think anyone‚Äôs downvoting you
---
no u
---
I saw that too! RETLOVE!
---
because everyone needs it and some people may prefer not be an asshole like you
---
Yeah personally I thought Troll would rank marginally above Undead as Troll can play 6 classes and Undead is only 5. That pvp utility does go a long way I guess.
---
!RemindMe 1 day
---
Far less? Really?
---
Don't catch you loggin though
---
These guards they be trippin' though
---
same issue, can't send the message it just stays in my chatbox when I press enter. I don't think I have the config options part of the addon, perhaps?
---
Just because Blizzard's implementation of dynamic respawn is a smarter one than some random private server implemented doesn't mean it's not dynamic respawn. Dynamic just means that it changes is response to some variable. It doesn't mean one specific implementation.
---
setting up UI for release is "tryharding" ?
---
I was at -4 when I made that edit
---
I'm relatively young and was when I was playing Diablo 2. I loved runewords however Engima itself ruined the economy and really changed party dynamics. It was much harder to find a group as sorc now that everyone do a quick tp to chaos or keep.
---
Were you wearing a diaper during the act?
---
Actually reine could mean pure or clean in german. ü§îand Dame could mean Lady.
---
&gt;It's a different type of spawn rate increase than retail.
---
Except it's really not!
---
I think it'll make a comeback. I hope so anyways.
---
I know one way is Wallpaper Engine.
---
They're still up btw, so if anyone want to try out the game before launch now is the time.
---
Pain. Fire. Brimstone. 
---
Naw, you'll have fun.
---
&gt; I have a pantheon please consider donating if you like the videos I make

*\*sacrifices goat to Zeus\**
---
I'll just leave it here but no, having a trigger between 2 static states is not a dynamic event.
---
A dynamic event is when something adjusts it self to different scenarios depending on what is happeing. Yes, if a lot of mobs die the respawn rate is highered.
---
But in this case it's just 2 static specific version of the respawn it toggles between. If you'd want to call this Dynamic Respawn it would also take in variables as time between kills, how many players and adjust the respawn rate to suit the needs, which it doesn't.
---
If you want to decide that you're wrong and don't want to learn, it's ok. That's up to you. I've tried to be somewhat educational, but that's all for me.
---
how big of a deal is not having a resurrect actually? i cant tell if people are exaggerating how annoying that is or if it‚Äôs actually a large hinderance in healing 5 mans
---
Maynard's voice has aged like a fine wine
---
Well the polls are already lying. I've been planning an undead horde priest for months on end and my friends just up and decided to go alliance in a 12 hour period without telling me, so I guess I'm rolling a human priest. I can't stand Dwarven animations. I mailed a dwarf warrior in vanilla and always wished I had gone human.
---
Well you shouldn't be fighting anything over your level anyways, there's no reason this is terrible advice. You pick your battles as a Warrior while leveling and go for low armor mobs and obviously you aren't doing this with two caster mobs. 
---
I routinely fight two mobs my level as I level on my Warriors. You generate so much rage this way that you end up dispatching of the multiple mobs together than you would have separately. 
---
More than two mobs can be done without issue or risk depending on their mob type. Murlocs vs Humanoids etc.
---
You need a program like [Wallpaper engine](https://store.steampowered.com/app/431960/Wallpaper_Engine/) or [RainWallpaper](https://rainysoft.cc/rainwallpaper.html)
---
You are wrong. This bug was introduced in patch 1.10 and then fixed in pre-TBC patch 2.0.1.
---
So we had  ~18 months in Vanilla where Scatter didn't trigger Freezing Trap DR, then few months where it did (BUG) and then from the pre-TBC patch forwards it didn't trigger the DR again, it was fixed.
---
And now, as a filthy neckbeard, I am going to lobby agianst this *modern* feature.
---
&gt;there is a lot of information about the respawn system from vanilla from 2004 and forward.
---
Considering that exactly zero private servers correctly implemented the Vanilla mob spawn behavior, I'd argue that actually there is not "a lot of information about it", at least, not accurate information.
---
I think Druid is a perfect choice for you! Druid heals are always great. Druid tanking is easier early and manageable for higher levels. Druid DPS is a tad lackluster but if you‚Äôre willing to tank or heal most dungeons then you don‚Äôt really have to worry about that. 
---
As for questing, druids can chain pull mobs and really make questing fly by. Everyone loves MotW as well so if you have the mana be sure to buff fellow adventurers!
---
Thank you, that's super helpful! Follow-up question: which classes can heal well enough to serve as a dungeon group's primary healer, and which classes can tank well enough to serve as a group's main tank?
---
golden
---
I was playing on max settings, why wouldn't they show on max?
---
This is dynamic spawns
---
&gt;different spawn regions have different thresholds at which automatic respawning is triggered
---
So, it kind of is
---
ty will try both now !
---
No offense but I prefer the Ironforge one, with subtle heat ripples.
---
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1769257637
---
The conditions are static, not dynamic. So no.
---
Could be pretty cool if you do it like Gadgetzan and other goblin towns. Once you are exalted, the guards do not intervene anymore if you engage other players in that city.
---
So you have a reason to grind to exalted to engage in wPvP in the neutral city any time you like.
---
Oh, I see.
---
I was handing out water to casters when I would see them on my mage.
---
No, the first person to ring the gong got the title...
---
Look at the words "Male", "Warrior" and you'll clearly see it.
---
Because a bunch of private server people have spent like 6 years insisting they knew better and that Vanilla didn't have dynamic spawns, and they'd rather make fools of themselves than admit they were wrong.
---
/u/vredditdownloader
---
Exactly what the spawnrates were, no one knows but Blizzard. But how the respawn rate functioned has been explained plenty of times.
---
1 state of respawn rate
---
2nd state of higher respawn rate
---
It toggles between them, mostly in earlier zones.

Why would people line up? Just skip that quest. Seems like a massive waste of time.
---
&gt;there‚Äôs no reason this is terrible advice.
---
Actually yeah there‚Äôs a great reason it is terrible advice and it‚Äôs that you‚Äôll die a fuckton if you regularly pull multiples as a warrior
---
Community events, and some naming rules
---
If only one person is dying every 30 minutes or if it's a complete wipe you're good. If 2-4 people die you have a serious problem unless you brought a real rezzer or at least a Warlock for porting. I mean, it depends on you mostly. A well trained group might not die at all. A PUG? Good luck. Especially when the enemies respawned and you can only rezz one person.
---
This is amazing!
---
Not sure what that has to do with my post!
---
Play what you want to play. I think there will be enough room for hybrids in Classic, given what we know now about the fights.
---
I mean, you can clearly check my post history and see that's not the case, but yeah this pretty much proves my point...
---
You can always go a gathering profession
---
I saved like 30 newbies from dying to starting zone mobs. Old guys gotta step in sometimes.
---
Because the 1.12 client is 5% of the game. 95% is the server back-end and how it communicates with the client. That part has to be reverse engineered.
---
My now ex told me she felt like something was missing so I said yeah me and we broke up.... I can now play classic without any distractions. üòÇ
---
It's one of the view classes that I as tank actually interview, because a good 50% (or more) do not understand their class and I have to decline their wish for group invite.
---
As enhancer you will: 
---
1. put down windfury totem
---
2. strength of earth totem
---
3. mana totem
---
4. not use lightning shield
---
5. drink like all other mana users when you are oom
---
I always try not to sound all high and mighty, but when an enhancer spams earth shock, is notoriously OOM and does not drink (even if we have a mage in group), I get really irritated. Asking every single fight for windfury and he gets annoyed, I kick him.
---
One of the few classes that don't understand their role in the group. :(
---
Oh right the last update made it kinda work. Still not working for a few spells (like Summon Imp) but I guess that will be updated as time goes. Thanks!
---
Dominos worked for me last night, bartender did not.
---
I don't think they do. The iFixit teardown didn't mention onboard storage. Flash storage was not mainstream when these servers were in operation, and the two spinning hard drives it had have been removed.
---
The servers are HP ProLiant BL25p. The specs for it say it has gigabit LAN built in, so you don't need external networking equipment. Just plug it into your router so it can get online. If you wanted to house it "properly" you'd buy a rack mount, yeah.
---
None of that information will exist until characters start being created, and even then likely only through a third party website
---
Depends on if that‚Äôs how you wanna do it. Not everyone makes enough gold, from lack of ability-lack of time, to pay for their sub. Or they‚Äôd rather pay with money. Still stands that you‚Äôll have to pay for two subs, no matter how you pay.
---
After some testing, I'm not sure Clique works fully. It seems to be using the "/cast @mouseover spellname" and ignoring rank, which could be troublesome for some healers.
---
You can bypass this by using the "bind other" option for downranking spells.
---
nah with all the different servers and layering i think 30 will be it
---
How viable is a Feral Druid (bear-form) as a:
---
* tank in 5-man dungeons?
---
* off-tank in raids?
---
* main tank in raids?
---
Gotcha. Thanks for the reply!
---
Low level resto talents are quite strong for leveling while giving you a bit of an edge healing dungeons. Furor and enrage are great since you'll be shifting forms frequently, Imp Healing Touch is very helpful particularly once you hit your 3.5sec cast Healing Touch, reflection speeds up leveling quite a bit when you're jumping between forms, and Insect Swarm is a great way to open fights.
---
You don't NEED resto talents to heal dungeons, and HotW will also be a big boon to dungeon healing, but it's not like resto is going to totally gimp your leveling.
---
This is incorrect. I played Druid at 60, and people not bringing Druids to dungeons as a healer is real, was real, and will continue to be real in remade classic. 
---
Either make your own groups, play horde side with an ele/enh/spriest, or get used to it.
---
Omg this actually cheap joke cracked me up so hard. This is brilliant omg
---
Ill get a brief survey going for this. Just asking realm and faction.
---
Not even gonna bother with the stress test, I feel as if it would only stress ME out lol. Launch is going to be a shit show no matter which way you cut the cake but damn am I excited!!!
---
Considering you have to look at your character model do things all throughout the game, seems like as good a metric as any.
---
Why is that so hard to understand?
---
Vanilla von February is my favorite vampire
---
Everyone says orc but its troll
---
I was getting ready to delete some of my kobold shovels when a rogue traded me one, so I traded her two to be cheeky. Then I was like... wait, that‚Äôs an actual weapon,  but there‚Äôs noooo way it does mor dam.... *it does more damage!*
---
Then I smacked a couple pigs with my new shovel and logged off. Sugarlumps will be missed.
---
pretty salty location =)
---
That‚Äôs my auto run key
---
but throughout the game suggests high level content etc, too. I agree with you but I still think their wording is a bit unspecific.
---
I have no idea what you are trying to remind us of.
---
There are also many of us, who have purposely been playing stress tests and/or beta with the opposite faction from their go live plans, because they wanted to save something for release.
---
Sorry, auto correction on my phone xD
---
Org still has those harsh shadows I see
---
Enjoying those 60 fps? Lol

TOO SOON. TOO SOON.

Pretty disappointing, especially as they were so adamant that it would be ready for classic like 3 whole months ago.

Doesn't work like that. You need to download the ram.

Everyone says things they don't mean, but that shouldn't be the majority of your encounters. You shouldn't have to be a selfless hero to treat others with respect. It's not hard to think about how your words may affect the person behind the screen. 
---
Maybe they just went through a nasty divorce, maybe they had a close family member or even child/SO die, maybe they are younger kids and get bullied to hell in school, maybe they are younger kids and get abused at home and try to escape online, etc. 
---
There's SO many possibilities that are more common than you think, and sure maybe the majority of you wouldn't lose sleep if something you said caused one of these people to commit suicide, but I would.
---
SteamLink is free to use as well.
---
I fish and pick flowers when I cant find helpers 
---
but find a warrior and he can just go berserk with a healer priest at his side
---
Im gonna play Ret for sure. Ppl just need to understand its more a support dps rather then pure dps.

Hi, /u/trushbeard
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/co2ptj/herioc_orc_posing_in_front_of_stormwind/).

People is being a bit too kind. You mean children, literal children. It's not an insult, it's a part of them growing up. It's the only reason he's as big as he is. 
---
They're not all kids, some watch for his discussions but the vast majority ARE kids.
---
That‚Äôs a good sign, because personally, I think the first 2-4 hours are the worst part of the game. I still like it, but I‚Äôm always so excited to get to level 18-ish and start doing dungeons and adding people to my friends list.
---
They were actually being more specific with that part, explaining that the dynamic spawn system is a global system and not exclusive to starting zones. Just that it's tuned less aggressively as you go into higher level areas.
---
It'll certainly be *better* with dynamic respawning, but it's the 1-5 zones that are mostly affected by it and you can't skin anything in those zones. 
---
Still, yes, it will definitely help in getting that early silver.
---
He's just faking it, you can see how he's spamming the (1) ability to fake it
---
Starfire could crit big, maybe like ~3k? But for world pvp that‚Äôs not really what you are focused about. It‚Äôs gonna be a lot of dot, kite, and run...which that spec is reallyyyyyy good at.
---
Never assume...  
---
And so what... server names dont affect anything.
---
Does anyone know if move anything works, or if there is an equivalent? 
---
Also curious if there is an addon to display the hp/resource under the player permanently that will work in classic.
---
There's your bug, have you tried without?
---
I was #1 in honor on my level 40 twink shaman (31-40 bracket) and gained like 10% towards rank 10, wasnt hardcapped but felt really annoying so sent ticket about it.
---
Perhaps got a hardcap later on, but i gave up the plan of getting my pvp epic mount at 40 :(
---
He might not have a computer science background? CS people's brains are wired a bit differently imo
---
Playing my rogue and passed out frayed robes and chain vests like Santa Clause.
---
They already got the info they needed during the peak hours
---
I played 15 years ago and leveled multiple Vanilla characters and it was like the first time playing all over again. I forgot all the quests and had to google a few answers to figure out where I was going.
---
This stress test made me so much more pumped for WoW!
---
Tank in 5 man no problem.
---
Tank in raids? your guild will have to rally around you and be prepared to put some heavy ground work in eg farm gnomer for crowd pummelers for early threat gen but it is certainly doable more viable than paladin
---
Thanks for this Seguren. I used your warlock field guide as part of my leveling build guide (with credits -- I hope you don't mind). Looking forward to updating it to the new version.
---
That makes a lot of sense actually, thank you
---
You're pretty rich eh?
---
I don't play retail anymore, but how does one farm 130k in 5 hours?
---
Wrong move taking day of off. Its almost certain that the servers will be absolute ass
---
I'm having fun playing the boring ass starter zones.  Can't imagine how it's going to feel getting out of barrens for the first time.
---
&gt;Max Rank Achievable By Bracket
---
&gt;The maximum Rank you can achieve is capped by your character‚Äôs level. These are the max ranks that can be achieved in each level bracket:
---
&gt;60: 14
---
&gt;50-59: 13
---
If I recall correctly you can hit rank 14 at 59. It says so on the wiki:

Was trying very hard to find lightning in the pictures. Very confused for awhile.
---
Right, even when I played a warlock and a priest yesterday, I would melee tag mobs because waiting to cast a spell just doesn't work.
---
At first it can be frustrating but it soon becomes a game in itself and mob tagging is an art form :)
---
Do you read?
---
He said Live Chat.
---
I think I have discovered your problem.
---
You get a connection with your character as you progress through all of Azeroth. Dont get the same feeling when you just insta lvl and raid finder while never leaving the city.
---
This all seems pretty cheap actully.
---
Talking beta experience here, I've never been rejected because of no rez. I did ask the party to play it save.
---
Sup everyone, I myself am a druid main and plan on rolling druid again in classic. I have played druid during vanilla a little and heavily on private servers. I'll tell you what you can do and cannot do in a brief summary below. A lot of people will tell you druids are not viable and that youre better off rolling with a different class. I am here to hopefully guide you in the right direction and convince you to play one of the most versatile and dominating classes. 
---
TLDR; Can do: everything, Cannot do: boomkin 
---
Druids are easily one of the hardest classes to play. This is especially true in pvp. 
---
1. Leveling: Leveling is extremely fast on druid. Not many people are going to have a mount by 40 and you will be the fastest class until then. Feral levels incredibly fast with minimal downtime. You regain mana while in cat/bear/travel and can easily pop out for heals. Around mid 30s might be a little challenging for you, but once you hit 40 you pick up a bit more speed. 
---
2. Pre 60 dungeons: You are the best tank available pre 60. You WILLLLL be asked to come tank every dungeon multiple times a day. People will add you and be more friendly towards you because only a certain % of the population plays druid. Hell, people will go out of their way to get a warlock to summon you for the dungeon. You are catered to... after all you are a bear king ;). 
---
3. Pre 60 pvp: Many times you will be crossing paths with alliance during questing. Pre 60 pvp with a druid is absolutely insane. You tear through every cloth wearing class. Fighting a rogue or warrior is reliant on starting with applying dots/abolishing and tanking them the rest of the fight, only to come out after a bash to heal. You will win way more than 50% of your 1v1s if youre using your toolkit efficently. Most people do not know how to fight a druid. This will be the same at lvl 60. 
---
4. PVE at 60: Two specs you can go. Well - actually more than that BUT. Hybrid HOTW which can be 1/29/21 or 0/30/21. The first one can be a little bit more pvp specced as youd take natures grasp for another escape tool. Youd want to spec more into cat damage with this one. With 0/30/21 you get more stam and int overall. BOTH of these specs CAN be used in raiding. If you are getting geared up and know how to hold agro on a single target you shouldnt have issue with talents oriented for pvp. Another amazing this about both HOTW specs is that youre specced into resto and at any point can hop over to your resto gear and heal the next boss if a warrior wants to tank/ot the next boss. IMO you should do both during your first few raids. You want to figure out what workd for you. You gear FAST. If theres no resto druid in your raid and youre tanking, the gear is going to end up in your hands. Same thing with tanking. Many tank pieces that drop are given to tanks over other classes since theyre far more important. And many leather pieces are oriented more for tanks. 
---
   1. Also another spec is deep resto. This focuses on healing touches being your primary healing spell. With the ability to apply regrowth and rejuvinates on a tank and swiftmend them for an instant heal at any point things go bad. Not to mention, a 15 second cooldown. You are extrmeely valuable to a raid given your ability to innervate one of the primary healers and provide 2 strong instant cast heals (Natures swiftness and swiftmend). 
---
5. PvP HOTW at 60: My favorite. Your spec in heart of the wild 1/29/21 is optimal in the first few phases of wow classic. You deal decent damage and have a large pool of mana to work with for shifting. Which gives you a huge advantage in negating movement imparing effects. timing is everything when learning to shift in and out. I strongly suggest getting an addon such as luna frames or druid bar so you may monitor your mana in a shapeshift form. HOTW will also allow you to have strong heals out of form, regenerate mana while casting, and best of all, an instant cast Max rank Healing Touch. Furor is such a wonderful talent considering youll be shifting in and out during many fights, and furor gives you rage or energy immediately upon shifting into bear or cat. 
---
\- PVP resto at 60. The flag running champion. In phase 3, for WSG, this is the best flag running spec in the game.  If you decide to run resto early on in phases 1 and 2 youll have a hard time killing people, but people should really never kill you. You have the hots to survive, and the mana to shift and run away. You will be able to kill most classes, however, it requires a bit of work lol. Running a resto build for world pvp is exceptionally fun when you have a warrior friend. A warrior running around with heals provides the biggest damage in the game. Not to mention your ability to root their victims, stun the enemy, and pop out for strong hots. 
---
Most importantly, you have to realize that your class is NOT the damage dealer warrior or rogue. Your class requires far more effort than most classes (no offense to my warrior/rogue/mage friends!) in both raiding and pvping. You are a jack of all trades and master of none. But with a lot of dedication and grade A playing, you will dominate many many people. You will make a name for yourself EVEN AS A CASUAL if you can play the class decently.
---
This, ultimately.
---
No one is going to run any of the lower level dungeons with the intent to gear or for exp, as raids nerf exp gains. Outside of a few niche instances of people doing silly shit, the cap not matching exactly doesn‚Äôt matter at all and is not worth Blizzard even looking into.
---
Bad decision! Why the fuck do you need Layering+Dynamic Spawns. It should be one and the other. In some Areas the Enemies spawn quicker than you can kill them. Especially in Caves and mines this becomes a deathtrap, when there are too many people there.
---
That would be amazing. Thanks!
---
What did I do to you man, lol
---
OneBag3 works.  
---
WoW client complains that addon is outdated, but it works.
---
This should be top comment.  Enh can be a very effective offtank for casters though, or at least use rank 1 shocks for interrupts like a rogue would kick, or warrior would pummel/shield bash. 
---
But yeah WF totem is first priority. 
---
Stoneskin is sometimes a smarter option.  The hp it saves adds up quick on some of those 4 nonelite, 2 elite mob pulls you see in places like BRD a lot.  Or just straight AOE pulls, either way it can easily save the healer some mana.
---

---
Sorry for hurting you
---
seriously i get that you have nothing better to do then harass people with a problem that you dont have but live chat doesnt open until 10:00am PST, seems like you can't read
---
This is the real answer. This is why resto druids should make friends with as many spriests, ret pallies, and dps shamen as possible. 
---
I can remember numerous times in BRD where a less experienced player would die repeatedly and then have to find his way back through respawned pats. No bueno.
---
I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm just saying I don't care.
---
I play UD priest, but may switch to troll priest. I like healing so I am going to stick with that!
---
1. Classic is a journey on its own explore the world and the quests in it, trust me you'll enjoy it more! If you aren't planning on server first then you got nothing to worry about classic is a marathon not a race. In my opinion i think classic wow is better for casuals since you got less to worry about since you don't have to keep farming for ilv which a casual player would struggle with getting since they have to raid and farm pearls a lot and in classic you can actually work towards an end goal which, is your Pre/bis sets. Farming consumes would be kinda hard i suppose until you're at that end game point where you don't need to level or grind for more pre bis gear and you can focus on raids.  You'll should be fine. :)
---
2. Leveling is a bitch with some classes like warrior so yeah kinda. Not has bad as bdo tho. But still, leveling is fun for most people since you get to explore and experience the new zones and if you actually read the quests you  learn a little about the lore. So it doesn't really feel like a grind. Consumables are grindy since you'll need a lot for raiding but when you're at that end point it's all you'll do really for raiding.
---
3. Druids are good but people see them as only healers, dps and tanks are kind of looked down upon. But they are fun to play. If youre looking for a fun class casters are always good and i enjoy them. Especially since i leveled a warrior to 60 but i was bad back then and went prot all the way through leveling so idk
---
4. You'll see some spam in chat advertising them XD. But i recommend finding a guild through playing with people but whatever works for you. I'm gonna be making my own with some of my friends and try make it a raiding guild. 
---
5. You won't worry about grinding a week into it you'll be addicted XD. Like to hear others peoples thoughts on what i had to say
---
lol, imagine avoiding a class just cause they don't have a standard rez. Maybe you could brez the shaman in your group to get the rest of the group up? Or the priest? Not having a standard rez should never be the reason why you decide against the class.
---
Alliance, Dalapin. Gosh we probably played BGs together it seems like forever ago. The Kirin Tor were always running around
---
that waa honestly very interesting to read, thank you for linking that
---
Strange, I tested 10 addons and they all worked. Perhaps the ‚Äúload unsupported Addons‚Äù box got unchecked?
---
Nice to hear that the assist macro worked :)
---
Because as I've told the idiots on this reddit, layering was never there to address starting zone mob competition. They always pulled the "hrr drr I'd rather have layering than dynamic respawns" card which never made sense, clearly shows pro-layering people don't have a clue why it's there for in the first place but will defend Blizzard regardless.
---
Anyway, layering is there to address the influx of tourists and significantly reduce queue times.
---
PVP is decently fun.  You have big weaknesses (being kited, stuns mostly) but if you pick your spots wisely you can literally 1-shot people which really only reck paladins and 3-minute mages can say.  
---
That being said it's rare to 1 shot but it is fun when it happens.  
---
When you first attack someone, make sure that the autoattack lands and THEN cast stormstrike right after.  You don't want to stormstrike first cuz then your swing timer starts and you miss out on an entire attack.
---
Alliance, Dalapin. Gosh we probably played BGs together it seems like forever ago. The Kirin Tor were always running around.
---
Joke's on you OP, you can't escape from Classic :D
---
Everyone can act an angel here knowing full well they don't care about some random line for a skippable level 3 quest, like for real, nobody would ever remember that
---
What sort of person complains about pet battles? They could literally be in classic and you would never know if you didn't play them.
---
Aww, you have to wait and not bug an entire subreddit about a isolated technical support issue your having? 
---
Shucks.
---
Yeah that doesn't sound like the client's fault, I think there's just something wrong with your machine, could be anything. I'd check your temps first and see if something needs cleaning.
---
or just use &gt;== 0

What are your graphics settings? Are you playing on Classic settings or maxed out? Orgrimmar is totally different with shadows, there's no way that picture is on Classic graphics.

You are absolutely right, can't believe you're getting so much flack. Having said that, I will miss 10 man Strath/Scholo runs as well as 15 man UBRS. Felt really cool to be able to be in those larger groups in the high end dungeons.
---
ty so much :O
---
My stress test was great and it had three key moments:
---
1: hitting level 2 and getting MOTW. When I logged into my account on retail about half a year ago I wandered around Mulgore seeing newbies leveling and I wanted to buff them only to realize MOTW didn‚Äôt exist. Yesterday, hit level 2 and immediately slammed a buff on myself and the biggest grin came across my face, that feeling was something I‚Äôve missed for a long time.
---
2: my wife seemed vaguely interested in playing. I showed her the character selection screen and she said ‚Äúew‚Äù when she saw the undead and troll female characters. Then I showed her a female Tauren and she said ‚Äúnow that‚Äôs cute‚Äù. So I jumped on my Druid and said ‚Äúlook how easy this is you should try it‚Äù to which she said ‚Äúok maybe later‚Äù. I‚Äôm counting that as a win.
---
3: all of my shit was in German for some reason! On my desktop everything was great, so I logged in to test the game on my laptop. For some reason everything was in German and it certainly made the leveling experience interesting for half an hour before I switched back. I enjoyed casting ‚Äúzorn‚Äù and will probably always call wrath Zorn now lol.

You just removed it from your bar
---
Towellie is a whore and will suckle that classic teet till it‚Äôs raw LOL
---
But you're assuming that you already have a shaman or priest in the group.
---
All I am saying is that people in this sub LOVE to downplay the issues that the druid class has. For me personally, the lack of a rez is enough to play a different healer in classic this time around.
---
I teared up a little when I saw how packed Stormwind and Ironforge were. It felt like going home.
---
I mean it's possible to do but generally that's not something top levelers seeem to have ever resorted to. You can tell by how they log off for a few hours each day. Maybe we'll see people try to do that in classic though, who knows.
---
Gave away my greens to randos. Leveled up alchemy and gave away most of the pots. Good times.
---
Good post. I was in a 50-59 guild called the 59-ers on Silvermoon and we racked up huge amounts of CP‚Äôs I made it all the way to 11. It was great fun, but those at 60 really hated us :-) as the amount we as a guild was racking up really screwed them up and made them have to get even more against far harder opponents. 
---
And it was easy tbh, a 59-er‚Äôs guild group would simply destroy random alliance in WSG, with a number of 5-7 minute 3-0 wins (I suspect many Alliance players gave up when they saw us to be fair, which always helps)
---
Based on what was announced for the Chinese region (8 total servers, 2 each of pve pvp rp and rppvp), avoiding streamer servers isn't likely to happen.
---
When I roll horde, I will more than likely roll troll hunter that was my first ever horde toon :D
---
For sure it's good, I was originally gonna run from the orc to tauren zone and get skinning en route for the few mobs on the way, but honestly with dynamic respawns it's actually gonna work out better to just run to Org at 5/6 then hearth back to Razor Hill.
---
But, yes, skinning's great for that early money, I snagged a few corpses en route to the Tauren camp.
---
Man 2004-2009 was where it was at.
---
...yes, so there's no possible way that I could have been "spamming 1" like you accuse me of.
---
I literally just right click the mob to start autoattacking and then do nothing else other than cast Rejuv.
---
Actually I was looking for others who remember this. I did most dungeons at 60 in 10 mans. The only time we dropped down to 5 was when someone wanted to complete the quests. Being in a raid wouldn‚Äôt allow quest completion.
---
I care, I have fond memories of running DM with a bunch of lowbies like the OP, it was actually a challenge, unlike level-appropriate 5-man DM. Not everyone cares about min/maxing efficiency. 
---
It's not game breaking in anyway, but a lot of people are playing classic to relive some of the fun and silly activities that were once possible.

First off, stop responding to the trolls on here. They're assholes and you'll get nowhere with them. It's not rediculous that you came to a subreddit for a specific game to see if anyone else playing the exact same game had a similar if not same problem as you. So just ignore them. 
---
Also, blizzard isn't especially timely with they're tech support, so maybe he did contact them and while waiting for a response reached out to the community for some help/advice as well....
---
Ok so what are your PC specs? Let's start there. Everything from OS to SSD/HDD.
---
Heresy!
---
HOTW druid geared more for pvp can actually be a strong class if you know how to sift in and out of slows when being kited. With gear, you will rarely die in 1v1s considering you have so many tools to out play your opponent.
---
Granted I work in tech, but I'm self-trained and have no formal training. I don't see how properly indented code is less readable than a long string of code.
---
At the human zone I saw a lot of mages and priest mostly.

Not sure when it drops, but waiting for azuregos or just farming gold to buy it should be easier.
---
And fyi you don't need the quiver for Rhok.
---
&gt; heavy ground work in eg farm gnomer for crowd pummelers for early threat gen but it is certainly doable more viable than paladin
---
Yeah no, that will only be needed in the most dedicated guilds. If he wants to off-tank as a druid it is no problem at all.
---
As if horde players don't watch his stream and try to form a group to kill him.
---
It would also be great to know which countries people are from who votes for each realm. But i don't know how that could be done :)
---
The post left little doubt as to how it‚Äôd be handled. Quests and patterns will be made available in the phase that matches the patch they was originally released.

? I wasn't even referencing you specifically, don't act like I'm over reacting. It was a simple post. You said there are truly no selfless actions, and I thought that was an inaccurate way to think. Nothing personal, no argument, nothing else.

Yea, that looks absolutely awful to try to play like that. Not sure how anyone could stand it.

Being mad? About what?

Ah good to know cheers!

Dwarf Priest for sure
---
1.	don‚Äôt keep any information about the skeleton other than coordinates, orientation, and a timestamp of when to remove it
---
2.	they could develop some ‚Äúgroup‚Äù skeleton geometry/textures to replace individual skeletons that are densely packed. However this would change the position of the skeletons slightly and would prevent people from drawing things with skeletons, which is fun - but also gold farmers do it mostly so maybe it‚Äôs fine.
---
3.	Batch remove skeletons by putting them into an event loop rather than keeping track of an exact timestamp for each one.

I prefer to keep my add-on usage low for two reasons. One is the wonderful bugs that crop up where you enter combat and using an item doesn't work ("Interface add-on performed an illegal action" or some such). Two is the need to constantly update things, or go major patch release days without add-ons you're used to. I've gotten used to the default UI where possible so I don't have to deal with orphaned or slow updates.
---
Great addition, thanks for that. Though, I don‚Äôt believe there is a skinning trainer in X-roads, only a vendor for the skinning knife.

Eh, I could see problems with handling support and bug reports from a ton of non-paying tourists. It's not like access to the stress tests has been all that big a deal anyway. Getting to play for a few hours out of two months is nice and all but it's a pale shade on the actual game.
---
Blizzard are very much like heroine dealers where the first fix is free and by god do you ever keep coming back.
---
Lighting + Shadows is maxed out, this was not on classic preset :)
---
Do you mind elaborating on how much of a detriment this is?
---
I've loved hearing about how much everyone loves priests, all the whispers, etc. But my guild asked me to play druid and I like the idea of a more "black sheep" healer if you will.
---
Will I have a generally worse grouping experience compared to other healers because of rez?
---
Damn, Classic looks so much better!!
---
Very similar experience! I was playing with my friends and I just was ecstatic to be playing classic. I had more fun playing WoW then I had ever had!
---
I was also unable to get Onebag working. It looks like it depends on Onecore, which in turn depends on Ace3 and I haven‚Äôt been able to find a working ace3 for classic
---
I am.  Male Dwarf paladin Alfougin, though I will be playing holy/ret while levelling, and holy endgame.  Was prot. the whole way before.
---
Gonna roll ud priest, never played wow before but i like undead in wc3.
---
Females have standard sized hit box, males is slightly larger.  
---
The larger hitbox can be both an advantage and a disadvantage depending on whats happening.
---
aye. This is what I do, I have 3/4 items or so that are stam+intellect heavy. That coupled with HOTW should give you a mana pool to allow two more shifts or another shift out-&gt;heal-&gt; shift in combo. 
---
You def want to stack agility for this tho. Replace strength stam gear with int stam gear instead of replacing agil stam gear with int stam.
---
This one already exists for a long time on Wallpaper Engine (Steam). I know because it's my wallpaper...

You mean specifically for languages on EU realms?

Don't even worry about Azu. As another peraon said already, you don't need it for Rhok. For Rhok you  need the black dragon sinew from Onyxia (~40% drop chance) and the ancient petrified leaf from Majordomo's chest in MC (50% chance). Once you have the leaf you can start killing the 4 demons, and good luck with that part: it's satisfying because it requires a lot of preparation and skill!

Im pretty sure there's a trainer at camp tarujo but at that point you're probably better off running to Org. If you die in the north-east part of the cave at the top of valley of trials itll send you to razer hill and the run to org isnt much further.

The title of this post makes it sound like the same dynamic spawn system that has been added to modern WoW was also present in vanilla which it was not. That is confusing and it is almost certainly on purpose :P It has nothing to do with private server players...

Coders are amazing. I'm in awe of their ability to make my life easier!

Good to know!
---
Yea 100% agree with you. Druids have a tough time against hunters lock and shamans. Hunters become easier at 60 but locks and shamans are always a tough challenge. Good thing theres no shamans on alliance and not many people roll warlock cause of undead racial. You will be hard pressed to find a class that easily counters you fight after fight.

Hi, quick question. I am planning to roll a tauren druid come launch. My gf, who is new to the game will probably roll some othe race. We would like to level together from the getgo, with me going to her starting zone. I've read though that the druid bear quest is a chain in mulgore village which I won't be able to start if I go to e.g. orc starting zone. Is there a way to circumvent that? Thank you
---
I think healing priests going tri-spec are better off mana-burning than a dedicated shadow priest would be.
---
Best part is the warlock duel in silithus
---
In early raids, bears are usually more viable than warriors. With pre-raid BIS (not counting rank 14 stuff) a druid is going to have much more health and armor. And they'll be able to generate more threat (a lot more threat with the crowd pummelers). I'd rather have a tank with more threat than be able to block and parry. Warriors do get better as they get more gear, but you still have trouble with threat. This is why you're seeing top end warriors having to spec fury. They simply don't deal as much damage/threat as prot to keep up with dps.
---
You go down the Disc tree until the 31 point talent Power Infusion (PI), and then 20 points in Shadow to get Shadow Weaving.
---
How do you know there isn't a problem with the game? Are you saying that a game can't cause your OS to crash? Just because the client/Blizz app loads up doesn't mean there isn't an issue with the game. 
---
Or are you saying that unless you're complaining about blizzard doing irrelevant things with Classic then you have no place in posting in this subreddit?
---
Either way, you're not a mod I'm guessing, or based off YOUR OPINION you would have already deleted/closed out this thread... So move on man....
---
One wasnt even a Troll, just an Orc..
---
Is Balance as bad as everyone says?  Can it at least perform alright in 5-mans while levelling, or will it really just hold every group back?
---
I wouldn't recommend it unless you're going for devilsaur tbh. Bag space is limited and it'll take up something like 3-4 hours of your time which barely makes up for the slightly faster L40 mount at best.
---
If you get lucky and get good bags early then maybe it's more justifiable.
---

You both have indentations at the same places except yours are wider and your comments are all mushed together with the code. The above is much easier to read.

It's even older than that. I'm old so I played the shit out of Warcraft 2 back in the day, and I was well aware of the Daemons, the twisting nether, the Great Dark (is it called the Great Beyond now? or Great dark Beyond) back in those days. I don't think they were very well explained, but they certainly existed.
---
Is Necrosis working or am I doing it wrong?
---
And yet it's not complete. It works for all the simply stuff but several options still error out. Good enough for now though :)
---
I can't find the patch notes, it may have been an undocumented change, but I vividly recall Blizzard talking about how they added the latter behaviour which always scales. They were quite proud of it at the time as it was a clear improvement over the fixed thresholds prior. A lot of classic fans, however, agree that this behaviour makes it too easy to get contested resources, because it well.. removes the contest, since there's enough for everyone anyway.

[This](http://tobolds.blogspot.com/2007/01/dynamic-spawn-system.html) is the best I can find in terms of source, although it doesn't include a direct source from Blizzard either.

I honestly can‚Äôt take credit for this script, my high school programming teacher is the real MVP. I thought I got it from Reddit when I first thought back on it, but that was a different macro for rotating through abilities that doesn‚Äôt work anymore. (No more one button Hunter rotation.)
---
This should be a legit tactic on launch day lol. Just run to the later zones and loot chests.
---
Remindme! 15 days

just rt &amp; commentz on them Twitter,  [https://twitter.com/Warcraft\_FR](https://twitter.com/Warcraft_FR)  share them as well :)

Everyone needs it, and everyone can get it - the line does one thing, and that's making sure that anyone who spends more than a couple of minutes in it has wasted their time.
---
How impossibly soft are you to be mad about natural competition in video games? Should we also make lines for herb spawns and rare mobs?
---
Although there are benefits for choosing some races over others, i‚Äôd rather stick with what looks good! So, probably human warlock for me this time!
---
Neat

Throw me a downvote if you're reading this and fluent in French

What‚Äôs wholesome family friendly post
---
HERESY
---
Are you saying to not skin in general? Skinning is fantastic extra gold in Vanilla, especially At server start. Devilsaur isn‚Äôt too plausible as they are mostly camped by guilds. It‚Äôs just the best profession on fresh for leveling. It hardly takes time to skin mobs
---
The Trump part made me giggle.
---
What are some of these meme specs?
---
I was going to but the names I'm going to play with won't fly on that server :(
---
I'm saying this clearly isn't a widespread issue as the game has been live for more than 12+ hours with noone reporting this kind of issue.
---
Its not an opinion buddy, its against the rules and not a problem with the game. He has an isolated issue, clearly. If you worked in tech support you would know that. 
---
His whole thread is a slap in the face to people who work in tech. Super minimal information, just to blame the client; just to go and post on a subreddit that is not about tech support. What a laugh. 
---
It is against Rule 7 though, its clearly not an issue with the game.
---
I'm not the person who posted the code, but here's what I see:
---

---
yep, im using the same wallpaper engine animated
---
it has been there for months.
---
So I may have to test this out on the stress test server because it's possible that some sort of global cooldown will prevent this from working correctly. It may leave you standing there like an idiot in human form getting pummeled.
---
This is the simplest implementation of what I'm talking about (if it's possible):
---
/use Master Healthstone  
---
/use Super healing pot  
---
/cast Dire Bear Form 
---
That should pop you out of form when you use the consumables and put you right back in to dire bear form. It may be, however, that powershifting works quickly because you're actually "recasting" your form rather than canceling and casting again, but I'm honestly not sure.
---
I can't remember. I can probably check when I get home from work today. If I can't find the link I'll set up a Google drive folder so you can download it.
---
I mean, if it's worth anything, playing a druid healer will make you stand out more. Theres less of you. You gear faster than priests/shamans/paladins. 
---
Youre right, people downplay the druids way too much (but let them, cause ya boi tryna get gear ASAP out here)
---
Just dont die and you wont need a rez! haha
---
I feel like the cap should be 5 regardless of how classic actually was.  It's the standard dungeon group size.
---
Ok so you meet the min/rec specs for the game as set forth by Blizzard. 16gb of RAM I'm guessing?
---
You might have a corrupt game file, so you could try checking that.
---
What all have you tried already?
---
Oh and btw, if it does turn out to not be the game then just try and go to another subreddit/forum for tech support.
---
Yea to know which realms who are the like "unofficial" italy, sweden and so on realms. The problem would be that people maybe will change realms after they voted because of this so the survey would become invalid pretty much :(
---
this is worse by a significant margin
---
I mean technically possible but who nolifes it hard enough to hit rank 14, but can't be assed to grind lvl 60?
---
I was having issues with this specific add on as well. I couldn‚Äôt get any spells to pop up
---
Either go back for it, or don't meet up with her until after level 10.
---
Druid is a hybrid class that brings more than just heals to the group. Of course priest is the better healer, but Druids are able to do basically everything. You can‚Äôt expect them to be the best at everything. Hybrid tax is real. 
---
Besides, I don‚Äôt know what kind of people you grouped with but Rez wasn‚Äôt a big deal when I played in Vanilla. Yes, it‚Äôs useful if you‚Äôre in group with terrible players, but not essential. There‚Äôs always going to be mediocre players that automatically assume priest is the only viable healer, which is far from the truth. BR (and Druids really) had the ability to save their groups from wipes. Stealth runs were also a thing with rogues and Druids.

Not org.
---
Secretly the best class in vanilla. There are so many different fun things to do at every level of difficulty/focus. 
---
Raid/instance healing, dps‚Äôing, tanking. Flag running, ganking. Instance stealth runs, solo runs, herbalism runs. Building/using obscure gear sets. Trying different talent specs. including the 3 broadly different healing specs. You can get away with being a casual as long as you brez properly, or you can go way down the rabbithole without ever getting bored.
---
Yea, this just makes a clickable button that does it. I prefer it because sometimes there are grey items with Lore elements I don‚Äôt want to sell so I want to be able to bank those first and not accidentally sell them.
---
This is why I said 95% of the time ;)
---
LITERALLY UNPLAYABLE. NO CHANGES!
---
You would need a LOT of alts and doing splits to get a bunch of people into the chain in time to allow the maximum number people to get the mount.
---
If your server was a piece of shit, and only one guild could clear BWL for the chain, you‚Äôd have much more time. But then you‚Äôd run into the issue of being the assholes basically holding up content availability for vanity items.
---
this one is perfect, altho idk how he feels about the herbalism alchemy now

Currently none of them work. Blizz removed spell rank from combat logs which is what all these ran off of. Every addon in the link regarding dot timers will not work until a workaround is found.
---
A fucking mage. And let me tell you, the realization when I woke up...I was not happy with my subconscious.

Been doing so for since the countdown timer was on 100+ days...

I'm living in New for a while now :D

is it 26th/27th already ? O\_O

Haha
---
That's not what that means. He's saying the respawn rates in starting areas are permanently higher than say, ungoro. It's not based on player count.

Patch 3.0.2 (2008-10-14): A lot of new emotes have been added:  /pet

P.S. Roll Horde

RT to win reddit haters :)
---
So... have you gone through this obsessive process with all your cutlery?
---
It gets very noticeable in later dungeons, especially those in blackrock spire as the corpse run is extremely long. In vanilla I did get rejected from a few groups because of this.
---
If you get the flight point in thunder bluff before meeting up in the Orc start zone, then get the orgrimmar flight point too. When you ding 10, goto TB for the quest and do that and go back again. Flying isn't cheap at that level, but it gives you what you want with very little impact. I remember doing that before to meet up with groups at the Undead start zone on a Tauren.
---
guess you're a mage.... Harry
---
Wtf give me classic back! #notmygame

It did that to me when I first installed it. I downloaded the master version from github and it worked properly

My Aunt and Uncle's pitbull ripped out the throat of their 15 year old beagle for no reason. I will never let children be around a pitbull.
---
We're playing with 1.12 talents, you know. This isn't a "catch", it's a design choice. 
---
I don't even understand the point of running dungeons in groups more than 5 because even back in 1.0 you couldn't complete quests in raid-sized parties and experience was severely diminished.
---
Yes, but Blizzard restricted their API in the latest WoW build so the cast timers are not that accurate anymore.

Lol it would be bad if you didn't! 
---
I would love to make a chrome extension that just automatically links the descriptions from wowhead classic
---
I posted on the ClassicCastBar addon last night and the owner has updated it. However, blizz removed some functionality the addon relied on. So it no longer can detect which rank of a spell is being cast. So by default it shows the highest rank cast time.
---
Less xp per mob kill probably, and maybe some quests couldn't get completed, and more loot competition
---
I went and bought some sub and went onto the stress test, and I've come to one conclusion.
---
I hate to admit it, but I think you could be right. There could be a secondary cause of lag, because the health bar updates are well within the 500-900ms delay area, I recorded a video and counted the frames. You can see the results here: 
---
1: 763ms  2: 850ms  3: 717ms  
---
4: 833ms  5: 533ms  6: 750ms  
---
That was the time between clicking the spell and the health bar going down. Additionally, the delay between "you cast x" and "X does Y damage" was within one batch cycle.
---
Finally, the delay between me clicking the button and getting the "you cast X" message was between 50-133ms delayed, so I think the stress test was causing a bit of server delay as well, considering I had just 15ms ping.
---
Yeah I mean.. They are server blades right. Thats just how they work.
---
My explanation was more geared towards people with no clue how the hardware in a server actually work or what the blades even are.
---
Better than nothing I guess. Thanks for the info.
---
Well if people have the choice they will take an other healer class (unless they have an hybrid dps like a ret pally already in the dungeon group). But since healer are somewhat scarce you shouldn't have issue.
---
What you can also do tho is to get a tank set and tank 5man. It's even easier to find a group as a tank. And if you have both tank and heal set, you can do both and then you can find any group whenever you want.
---
WoD was really cool for a big part. Just raids and half timeline of expansion sucked :p But I personally really liked leveling part, start of endgame and garrison had some really cool sides. So it didn't sucked completely. I would say it's still definitely better than BfA, which has some good sides but not as much.
---
Get out of here! Boomkin is no real spec... You can put Points into it - but you will always be a healer :3 :D
---
You could just use /pat. It's essentially the same :p
---
The only issue there is respecc costs are very high... so you cant realistically do that unless you're either going weeks at a time between respeccs OR super super efficient and devoting many many hours to grinding per day.
---
I mained an undead warlock back in the day, got in the mindset of trying out a mage perhaps.  
---
Joined a guild a few days ago where I could paly either, decided to go undead warlock again.  
---
I just fucking love warlocks.
---
Oddly enough it dropped off of like a lvl 7
---
In regards to ClassicCastBar, I commented on the addon last night and the owner has updated it. However, blizz removed some functionality the addon relied on. So it no longer can detect which rank of a spell is being cast. So by default it shows the highest rank cast time.
---
It's more akin to taking many, many clips from a TV series than a single movie. Which seems a lot more reasonable. If you repeatedly see clips from a TV show that come across as off putting your'e not going to give that TV show a chance.
---
Legend.
---
Warrior
---
Auto attack
---
I've always felt like female NE had the best rogue animations on alliance side.
---
A lot of people realised that lol, tourists discussions was huge when layering/sharding was first discussed, you aren't bringing fire down from Olympus
---
Honestly, I think most people think BFA is worse than WoD, even though it might seem impossible.
---
&gt; players that would do 10-man BRD.
---
have you considered that you can go in under level then and zerg it down? It would be pretty fun, Maybe even efficient. Not BRD per se but something like ZF you can go in with 10 players at level 40 and zerg it down till eventually you can split it into groups of 5
---
Wowowowowow - Warriors can also die
---
You can talk to people, trade, ask for gameplay advice, look for dungeon and raid groups, and even guilds, all the same as non-RP servers, and that is the standard.
---
Think of RP like you think of dueling. People may do it anywhere in the world (in the case of duels, not inside cities, but RP can be anywhere) and it can happen based on two (or more) people pre arranging it or simply by bumping into each other and making it known that the interest is there (setting down the flag for dueling, and for RP, it could be a slow walk or an in-character emote or message in /say). Both exist in the world at large, but they are explicitly opt-in. Outside of RP or RPPvP servers, there is no opt-in option for RP, but it is extremely rare for an RP server to be RP by default (opt-out).
---
I've seen people on this subreddit exaggerate the scale at which RP happens and pretending as if it's all opt-out in RP servers, even some people saying you can get in trouble with GMs or even banned if you have a name that's too real-worldy or out of character, or if you are unwilling to play along with the RP environment in some other way. Those people don't know what they're talking about, and unless you're consistently getting reported for going far out of your way to disrupt other people's experience, you won't get in trouble with server staff.
---
There's nothing entertaining about streamers. They just use the same dopamine feedback loops that social media uses to drive engagement with followers. 
---
If you donate or sub, you get a flashy popup and a brief moment of recognition. He even says your name. It's like combining social media feedback loops with a strip club. 
---
Everyone in the crowd of people following them is basically screaming "notice me sempai" at full volume with their words and actions. It's upsetting.
---
I have to disagree mate, as a vanilla Druid nobody wants you to tank or do dps when other classes significantly outperform those roles. Druid‚Äôs are fun to play, difficult to master and potentially powerful at outlasting other classes in pvp. At the end of the day though they‚Äôre a jack of all trades, master of none.

/startattack.

On EU in the human zone I saw a ton of priests warlocks and warriors and a few paladins and mages
---
Any good map addon that works? Specifically that works with Atlas? I always get an error from Atlas, saying it can't detect any map module.
---
I am using Mapster, which works (I hate having a fullscreen map, so it's better than nothing), but obviously Atlas integration doesn't work, and Fog Of War Replacement also doesn't work.
---
Which would mean you're going back for it.
---
I decided last night during the beta that will be rolling Male troll warrior. 100%
---
Someones mad.
---
Did it launch in 2005 i europe instead of 2004? im confused lol
---
So you're saying the majority didn't claim "I need layering because I wanna get out of starting zones asap" or "dynamic respawns are bad, layering is better!"
---
lol yeah no get lost.
---
Part of the rotation
---
I use the G502
---
I wasn't even in his layer but I had to deal with everyone spam yelling "invite to asmon layer plz!!!" It got old fast
---
Saving this, thanks!
---
It's interesting to see the difference between classes, warlocks have a million spells then you go to warriors and theres nothing in comparison. The classes with less spells have to pay more per skill though.
---
Thanks for this! If you don't mind me picking your brain a bit more...
---
Would it be hard for someone with no wow experience to keep track of having two different leveling sets? Or is it relatively straightforward?
---
Also don't compare BFA classes to vanilla classes, they're completely different.
---
I just use a Razor Taipan, but that's also cause I don't macro to the mouse due to old wrist/hand injuries.

---
I joked with my wife last night that I won't truly get to relive my classic experience because I have a computer that can actually handle it now. No more 5 mans at 20 FPS. :)
---
Level ranges may be wider than my comment but it‚Äôs a massive range and so even with a low drop rate, across that many mobs and players it shows up often :)
---
I considered that one too. But the thumb button is just slightly too far away from where my thumb rests.
---
Because it's a stress test and it doesn't count anyway. 
---
If it was live, a lot more people would skip it.
---
The new ultra settigns for foliage, shadows and water make a huge difference in appearance, I think they're pretty great personally.
---
I keep saying it. Classic WoW is gonna steal the thunder from retail. That will be real interesting to see.
---
I'm glad you had fun. The game is unforgettable. I hope you make some great memories playing it here with us in 2019.
---
Do you understand the difference between dynamic respawns and threshold respawns?
---
Just to inform the NA players, thete will be an unofficial spanish server there is colussion of over 20 guilds that will be rolling on the same PvP server plus alot of addicionals single players and we will be making a big marketing campain to have every spanish player on here.
---
Its going to be center time server.
---
Hosted on Chicago.
---
PvP server.
---
Once we have the list of the servers and some testing is donde i am going to make a post about it.
---
Best regards.
---
Likewise
---
That's what I thought, but in the stress test I tried using UnitIsTapDenied with the GUID of the mob I damage and UnitIsTapDenied always returns false no matter if I have the tag or not.
---
Yeah you would, because people running past your pet battle can see whats happening in your pet battle.
---
Thanks for compiling this list. Since I have seen a lot of people asking and nowhere that it's really explained, this is how you install a classic addon manually:
---
1. Download it from wherever. If you're getting it from Git, use the download as zip option.
---
2. Extract it (assuming it is in .zip or some other archive format) into a folder.
---
3. Look inside the folder. There should be a .toc file. If not, check the subfolders.
---
4. Rename the folder containing this .toc file to have the same name as the .toc file (minus the extension). For example, the "TomTom.toc" file must be in a folder called "TomTom".
---
5. Copy the folder into your World of Warcraft/\_classic\_/Interface/AddOns folder. If the Interface/AddOns folders don't exist yet, create them.
---
6. Close your WoW client (don't need to close the BNet launcher) and open it again. The new addon should be on the list now.
---
Notes:
---
* If the folder you downloaded has a version number or "-master" after it. You probably need to remove that part so the folder name matches the .toc file name.
---
* Some larger addons include multiple addons in the download. Copy each of the folders which contain .toc files into the AddOns folder following the above steps. It should be fairly obvious which ones are addon folders. For example the WeakAuras download comes with 4 addons: WeakAuras, WeakAurasOptions, etc. Each of those should have 1 folder in your AddOns directory and at least 1 .toc file inside it.
---
* Addon settings are stored in your WTF folder, not the Interface folder. You can delete/reinstall things in your Interface/AddOns folder as much as you want, and it won't mess with your config. Of course if you delete them they won't show up in the addon list until you put them back.
---
Depends on what you're facing.  
---
A skilled frost mage will make you cry out of frustration.
---
Defensive mode pet won't attack until you've been hit. If you want your pet to start attacking when you do macro it to your spells.
---
An ambidextrous mouse. Interesting!
---
I use the G602... I used a Naga before, and 12 was too many damn buttons.  The G602 has 6 buttons, and I like their placement much better.
---
It should be stated though that in my case the Naga fell flat because all of the buttons felt the same.  The G600 has a tactile build out that would be better to use IMHO compared to the Naga directly.   I still however prefer the G602.
---
Druids and warriors don't really share gear all that much so most guilds will gear both a druid and a warrior tank. Druids generate more threat thanks to pummeler abuse, but have less mitigation. Druids also don't have anything to remove fear with, so horde guilds won't usually use druids for bosses that use fear (e.g. Nefarion, Onyxia)
---
Hence, druids are optimal for farm bosses or otherwise when the damage on the boss isn't dangerously high. Healer mana isn't that great of an issue in vanilla, so if the tank isn't getting instantly splatted you're usually fine.
---
I cannot describe the chub I got when I discovered the album and classic wow are launching the same week.
---
My buddy's response: "I don't even know what the point of living any more after waiting for this moment"
---
You are so right. And I'll love it
---
They were specific about what the system entailed, yes. a bit less about how/when they tested and/or implemented it in the public client, is what I meant :P
---
Release feels like it's 10,000 days away.
---
Shaman tank or warlock tank
---
Druid heals
---
boomkin dps
---
Warrior arms DPS
---
40 seems a big deal for every class except warrior and rogue lol
---
I even think /e worked in classic. Which can make you emote whatever.
---
Waiting for server names to drop at work. I have a 3-4 minute process time during the tasks I'm doing right now, so it's about ever 3-4 minutes.
---
There is no sign up for RP pvp, you just make a character and play
---
This is so wholesome
---
Alliance &gt; Horde for tanking.
---
10% all stats from king = 10% more health &gt; 5% tauren health. On top of that you have extra dodge from the nelf racial and the extra agility and extra threat. Shaman won't give you that much as a bear because windfury is usually used.
---
Warriors are usually more competitive threat wise horde side so the benefit of a druid tank is less.
---
I like my G600 Its more than enough for me as a casual hunter on retail. Haven't got to play classic yet but I'm sure ill be happy with it for a long time.
---
Exactly. I‚Äôm saying the pet doesn‚Äôt attack yellow mobs even if they‚Äôre wacking me. I have the macro but I‚Äôm more interested in if this is a bug which will affect those who go non pet combat macros.
---

We picked up bfa for 2 months and had some fun, but it got dull so fast it was disappointing.
---
Can't wait for that classic grind!
---
As far as I know, auto loot doesnt work for pickpocket in vanilla, not sure about classic
---
No signup process for RPPVP realms. Just a different "rule set"
---
Realistic RP names (no "luvstospooge" or anything like that), no interrupting people RPing with non-RP, ect.
---
It's mostly a theoretical question, since I'll likely go resto anyway, but it's fun to play dungeons as a DPS caster and I was wondering if oomkin can ever be a viable alternative to Mage or Warlock.
---
Took his massive group of completely ungeared level 4s and tried to make a roadblock between Valley of Trials and Senjin.
---
yeah I noted on the OP
---
Pick Pocket is two words
---
If you want action bars use domino's and for name player Kuinameplates are very nice. Both work on classic.
---
I still use a Razer Naga til it breaks then I‚Äôll probably move over to a Logitech or something.

This is what excites me the most!
---
I think you need to reread the rules man...
---
Especially rule #2... Just saying....
---
Also, I see nothing about his post violating rule #7. Except you could make an argument for the "Google question" portion... Every question is googleable though... So.... Also a lot of times when I Google stuff it sends me right to Reddit üôÉ.
---
Maybe that's what happened and they couldn't find anything useful so they made a post. You wouldn't know that though because you instant went to shit on the OP...

I used to be a Male tauren prot warrior but this time I will be a male troll warrior because the passive is just to strong for leveling and threat generation in raids/dungeons.
---
I really like what they did with Orgrimmar, I don't like the old style with the stagnant aura of red dust. It's like Fallout: NV with and without the orange filter.

Sick. Did you take these just now? I'll test again when I'm home.
---
Support the mom and pop streamers

Probably still gonna do less damage than the other classes too LUL

Can you argument the last sentence a bit, what does that implies, I‚Äôm not too keen on those terms; and don‚Äôt want to be penalized. Also, doesn‚Äôt the Realms have a population cap?

Agree

devildanger - I will love you long time if you can figure out a very small simple addon that isn't working. It is called SimpleMiniMap - any chance you can look at it and see if it can be translated to classic?
---
Ahh ok, your post read like you expected your pet to attack as soon as you entered combat. If your pet doesn't attack once you've been hit by the mob and you're on defensive that is probably worth reporting to have blizzard check out.
---
Strat live 2-man farm with a war is the way to go
---
I'd like to know what the horde RPers do too. Or is there even any?
---
What's the point in having the possibility to play in the bus / train from everywhere if you start to carry complicated hardware everywhere... better use a laptop...
---
So, can I use steam link with **just my phone** ?!
---
It's a very common drop.
---
you got party and raid frame working?
---
Honestly BFA with the new patch is much more fun and challenging. Maybe play classic for a week and get max level and stuff for the experience but I don‚Äôt see why anyone would play it full time over BFA which is a superfood MMO in almost every way.
---
Just checked, same stars show in Durotar no matter what graphics.
---
Yeah, just checked and Durotar had the same stars too.
---
Scholo was 10 man, go look at old videos
---
Scrolling Combat Battletext or whats the addon for healing and the -/+combat ?
---
It absolutely terrified me how fast I was completely hooked by this game! First time I've played it since vanilla, and I expected to have some fun, but oh boy I couldn't stop playing.
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the lack of rez that lost you those groups; generally, if anyone in the party dies, it‚Äôs the tank followed by everyone else.
---
In Scholo and Strat, you wanted a Priest for Chain Undead, not resurrection. Lack of undead CC can be problematic in both dungeons; Druids are great for Spire with their ability to Hibernate Dragonkin.
---
cool story, don't use it then, kthxbai
---
Played both alot, would definetly say that WoD was WAYY worse.
---
Back in high school I once struggled to choose between going to school on my rogue or on my paladin in my dream. Then I realized how ridiculous that was and woke up. The love for WoW runs deep
---
Yeah I just got it working myself, had to redownload and mess with files a bit but its working. Gonna deleted the main.
---
Dunk wife has been there in every expansion, anyone that is concerned with RP has arguably a lot more to work with in current WoW.
---
And by "we," I'm referring to people that crave the game and world design philosophies of what separated vanilla's tone from every other expansion in the last decade. The reason countless "what made vanilla special" posts and videos beat the same concepts and ideas into the ground for the last several years.  RPers are a valid demographic, but they're not the majority's driving motivation for why there is so much demand for classic.
---
Wallpaper engine?
---
Can‚Äôt fucking wait
---
g600 here, It's the 3rd time i had to replace it tho. Very shotty buildman ship.
---
9:50 AM - get absolutely obliterated on reddit...or is that encompassed under the "etc" umbrella?
---
You can train gathering professions (and most weapons) at level 1. I picked up Skinning and Herbalism before level 5 numerous times on the Beta and Stress Tests.
---
Healer: Priest, Druid, Shaman, Paladin
---
Tank: Warrior, Druid. Paladin and Shaman can also work as dungeon tanks but I wouldn't recommend them for a new player.
---
Its against rule 1, because its an isolated issue. Nothing to do with the game.
---
Its against rule 7, because its a googleable question, because its an isolated issue.
---
Keep babying him mama!
---
Nice! That is what we all love about classic! No need to be OP or high end geared - you can alwa/ have fun :)
---
Fellow Druid here üôà
---
I was using it in Teldrassil yesterday and it seemed to work fine. Almost all of the quest givers + objectives were showing up on the map properly. I just downloaded it like 2-3 days ago. Maybe we have a slightly different version.
---
The technology? Yes. The rates its been on private realms &amp; retail? God no. 
---
:P
---
I'm late here but they mentioned that there was a bug with dynamic spawning they fixed so it should be a lot better than that shitstorm of the first beta test.
---
Where is Anvilmar??
---
none are working atm :(
---
atm I am using elvUI to mimick Simpleminimap but it's alot of config...
---
Ok I'm so going resto because I love topping overheals
---
Arm chair dev shit like this is so annoying. You know literally nothing so shut the fuck up lol.
---
That doesn‚Äôt exactly fill me with confidence, lol. :-/
---
This. Take Friday that week off, play over a long weekend.
---
This is what it's all about
---
/u/NovercaIls I'm going away this weekend, but I can take a look when I come back. However, I have my own addon [ClassicCodex](https://willitclassic.com/view/FetfyBR3BGtqmA7vPhQw) that I have to manage since I released it yesterday so that will take priority until classic release.
---
remember to divide the gold gain by 2 since the private server drop values are overtuned for lasher farms.
---
i think they were referencing the moonkin form
---
Yes, EU launch was Feb 11th 2005 :-)
---
Thanks, really needed a replacement for Cartographer. Going to try this later.
---
Will we be able to change race i.e dwarf &gt; human or is that not an option in classic?
---
This got me hungry for chili tbh
---
Why do you post this on every thread, it's driving me insane.
---
You're absolutely correct. This is the core of why we wanted classic wow. There were a ton of silly things that i enjoyed back then, no reason to change what already was.
---
Oh good! So my dream isn't dead to be the speediest guy in WoW : )
---
Well about the names I have heard of several people having their names forcefully changed do to not following the naming rules.
---
I would say the name is the only real thing you should consider if rolling on an RP server. If you have a tauren named something with beef you have a real risk of getting reported by other players.
---
I went from Orgrimmar to SW keep with a friend last night, on our two orcs
---
It took 3 hours, we gained 2 levels in the process and I have to say it was the most fun I've had in any game in years
---
No cutting into someone‚Äôs in character conversation with out of character business. Regarding population cap don‚Äôt stress it too much RP-PvP is a minority of the population, you shouldn‚Äôt have issues with an overly full server.
---
Meanwhile, after I cleared the path to this guy, I had someone snag him as I was casting, declined my group invite, and tell me to fuck off.
---
8.0-8.2 is the BFA version of WoW that classic is built upon. So those should theoretically work.
---
avoid any 1.12. those are for private servers
---
Mommy makes great chili
---
Thanks for this. I've updated to make this clearer.
---
You just can't have names that aren't like a Character name. 
---
If you see people RPing, you need to let them RP, you could walk up and RP with them sure, but you need to make sure you are "In Character". 
---
Honestly though, In my experience with Warcraft, they are pretty lax on the rules and won't ban or you anything unless its extremely OOC and offensive or something.
---
Imagine all the time you save with portals + free money from food/water.
---
So just YOU downvoted me and you think "we'll just let the downvoted speak for themselves" is somehow a valid retort?
---
Have you actually leveled a Warrior? Or are you just basing your understanding off Reddit telling you they're the slowest leveler?
---
They're slow but their rage mechanic is unique in the sense that both taking and giving damage gets you resources to use your skills. More DMG taken = More Rage = More damage dealt.
---
It's really not that hard to understand and any Warrior guide will tell you the same thing.
---
Roccat Nyth &gt;
---
That's an interesting consideration, one which I'll definitely take into account.
---
The downside to that is being surrounded by Undead Rogues and not having the option of attacking them.
---
I've been planning a rogue for months now and today I started doubting my decision and thinking I wouldn't be good enough to enjoy it.. And I got really sad because I've been looking forward to the launch for so long and now suddenly I'm doubting myself. I'll probably stick to it but I'm scared I'd find out I don't like it after all and "waste" my time.
---
Also my guild plans are not working out too good at the moment either so I'm not sure what to do. 
---
Sounds lame maybe, but classic has been a big deal for me for so long I'm scared to be disappointed
---
As a rogue who starts with stealth, instant melees, and the fastest attack speed, I enjoy watching these fools line up as I walk to the front with a 90% chance to claim the mob.
---
Nor should it lol. It's hard to find a quality mouse for hard usage these days :(. At least parts are usually pretty easy and cheap to replace. I've had to take this particular one apart multiple times in the last year or so. Replaced the middle wheel button, had to tighten the springs on the right mouse wheel push down as well at some point. Had to replace the entire internal bored once as well. Luckily i never throw anything out so always parts around somewhere.
---
Awesome. Looks like they've fixed them then? Will test again and edit OP. Thanks mate.
---
You use totems during leveling?
---
Lmaoooooooooo
---
Without RP-PvP, I would definitely select PvP. PvE servers are for ninnies. It's **WAR**craft.
---
Not really, I don't buy cutlery that I'm actually going to be putting in my mouth from unknown third-world sources ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
The incessant middle-school humor had the same effect on me. This got old fast and people don't seem to know when to let it die.
---
He is to Alliance players.
---
Raids were always 40 cap, it wasn‚Äôt till like 1.11 that all dungeons got a 5 man cap and BRS got a 10 man cap.
---
You can't actually play classic and be a big streamer.
---
In a way I feel bad, but that's just the nature of things. Classic wasn't meant to be streamed.
---
So when a big streamer tries to play it, they are fed so much loot it makes BfA loot seem scarce
---
It was actually common to run scholomance as a 10 man and UBRS as a 20 man before that patch
---
You could have just commented on said post rather than making a new post
---
Get [OmniCC](https://willitclassic.com/view/Xc5wPRJ7J6FT5hKQBC2L) paired with [Classic Aura Durations](https://willitclassic.com/view/SFMbZS2ioc4AtS1dEDm9), this will show Buff/Debuff Timers :=)
---
For future reference, you should be able to shift-click skills/items into macros so you won't have to care about spelling them correctly.       
---
Unless it was changed in the classic client ofc.
---
Any info about eu servers ?
---
Did you need to respond to it?
---
not that I know of
---
Your attempt to improve it made the comments less readable to me. When I read this as a block it is difficult to separate the code from the comments which is what I want to do. The left justified alignment of the original comments gave me a clear degree of separation while increasing readability. This isn't worth getting into a heated discussion over, I just find the original to be far more clear.
---
Ah, yes. Another report that is completely ignored because it doesn't actually break any rules.
---
Try turning off 1) Windows game DVR 2) Nvidia geforce experience streaming/recording /shadowplay 3) Discord overlay
---
Are the servers offline again?
---
Do you guys think there's value in picking up Leatherworking to pair with Skinning for the armor packs, or is it negligible in the scheme of things? (Feral/Resto spec if it matters) I'll be leveling an alt as well, class TBD so I don't necessarily need to put it on my main. I've never properly done professions in WoW, first aid is the only thing I've gone past 175 in.
---
I'm so ready. I've been playing other classes to not spoil the launch. Luckily I'm on a trip for a week before launch, which should speed up this painful wait. It's basically just deciding alt pairing and debating professions at this point.
---
Ill play with it and see if i cant figure it out!
---
Gave some orc a ton of flimsy chain mail i had found. they equipped it and started jumping around spasticly.
---
classic is easy but i doubt a streamer will be able to complete the timed BWL run if they arent already part of a decent raiding guild. otherwise theyd have to field their own raid and fill it with followers or form some sort of arrangement to have the run done (not happening). any attempts at organizing a raid for the timed run is going to result in griefing
---
A chef is the leader of the kitchen, no?
---
Glad I could help you commit suicide repeatedly, my friend. =)
---
I thought all the private servers repeatedly nerfed lasher gold because it was too easy.
---
Probably. Can I give you $5 so you can get the rest of the RAM?
---
I'm a programmer. Left justifying the comments makes it more readable to me. The attempt at improving them just made it more difficult to separate the comments from the code, therefore making it harder to read both the comments and the code.

It‚Äôs not missing. It‚Äôs under advanced settings
---
I meant people who insisted that Vanilla had no form of dynamic spawning *at all*.
---
Question for beta players on horde: is the tauren hitbox the same in bear and cat as it is for melee?
---
How much was it ??
---
Had something to do with latency or server lag too from memory.
---
Imgur mirror: https://imgur.com/a/vspLXHX
---
Spell batching. Google it. Not s bug
---
You got time for both! Congrats on the job!,
---
When you factor in the 3 seconds per mob, going to trainers, loss of bag space, and the grind of skinning from 1-50, in my opinion it barely pays for itself at best.
---
Yes wallpaper engine would be great!!
---
Are you running a duo monitor set up?
---
Ikr? Uninspired.
---
 RemindMe! 26 days
---
You can even kitty charge! https://youtu.be/pBc3kX_aJ70
---
negligible. I would not waste the time/money on armor kits.
---
Actually just like shadow priest, you nuke to open, then wand to finish.
---
No down time,
---
I almost logged in the stress test, but honestly I'm just waiting for launch day instead. Can't wait!
---
kui is what i use on retail its my favorite are u guys using the download from curse or a different source
---
for the ten thousandth time, no you cannot frontstab in classic. 
---
Can't believe this has to be repeated so much.
---
Yeah wow these names are the suckiest of the suck
---
So I got into the stress test, and just being a part of all the excitement was worth it to me. So many people, everyone excited. Region chat exploding with silly shit.
---
Be warned, some fonts can be problematic.  Usually it's quite easy though and doesn't effect anything.  I recommend making a sticky note and reminding yourself you did this in case it conflicts with something down the road.  It might save you headache troubleshooting when the cause is something you forgot you have done.
---
Mostly though, it shouldn't generate any issues.
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Samwise_Didier
---
But why did his face show up here?
---
God I hope so, if not then I need to download another wallpaper app lol.
---
Yes you do, it ends today so unless you wanted to dick around in bfa for 2 weeks I would suggest waiting for classic 
---
Nothing matters in the test anyway, it's just bug and stress testing, you dont get to keep toons or save names this way so yoire not missing anything but a nostalgia rush

Naaah... That would be silly

Yeah, the code and comments bleed together. I like to see comments cleanly left justified to the right of code.
---
Welcome to the life of the British
---
But no, it's fun chatting to others as you all desperately click to get the head. Grouping up etc.
---
You need /cancelform first. The consumable doesn't knock you out of form but instead gives you an error of "can't use that"
---
10-man originally, yes.  But was then switched to 5-man once the tier .5 quests came out.
---
Yeah it's lame as fuck but there's actually addons that combat it. 
---
The one I have is called Speedy AutoLoot, if I shift rightclick a mob and then start moving it will have looted it all.
---
&gt; master of none
---
Druids actually are the master of two things: 5 man dungeon tanking and flag running.
---
They do more DPS and TPS than warriors and are absolutely ideal for 5 mans, especially if speed is a concern.
---
FasterLooting is the name of an add-on you might be interested in.
---
Shield blast dot wand repeat
---
As a small streamer I'm even avoiding the big streamer servers because I don't want to deal with the bullshit that comes with them. I just want to do my thing and have fun with friends not meme the entire server
---
it shows in addons and as enabled but the nameplates just wont show
---
Grind mobs :)
---
Commenting to find easier later. I too would like to know if there's a solution
---
Hitbox is bigger for bear if I‚Äôm not mistaken
---
I didn‚Äôt mess with raid frames since I won‚Äôt need it for a awhile. But I setup player, target, party, party pet and maintank frames and they were all working correctly as far as I could test them at level 5
---
Some people got to the stress test level cap.
---
I got to level 6, purchased some abilities for testing, then set up all my keybinds, 10 macros, 19 addons, and 12 weakauras. WTF folder copied to a backup so I on launch day I can just paste it into my release character and roll out with my optimized UI.
---
you know how some hardcore guilds req people to have lv 20 warlock alts for summoning?
---
new requirement: every raiding member must have multiple accounts for multiboxing in order to be an autonomous carapace farmer. 40 members each with 4 mage accounts, killing those elites while multiboxing.
---
I was gonna say inb4 sells all your gear
---
Semi-related: be careful with defensive mode. The imp is currently defending other nearby players for some strange reason. This tends to happen when you body pull a mob and the other player taps it and takes aggro. As the other player takes hits, the imp will keep trying to defend the other player even if you tell it to follow.
---
Was the book for the imp quest on dynamic spawn?
---
Guy posting about all the fun variety in a druid-dedicated thread, listing some amazingly fun examples:
---
&gt; There are so many different fun things to do at every level of difficulty/focus 
---
You:
---
&gt; they‚Äôre a jack of all trades, master of none. 
---
Low-effort, mate. We literally know this, it's written on the hecking masthead of the class.
---
Press each ability until the target is dead.
---
Rinse and repeat.
---
Yeah, unless you also played mage, I think that your fun was just you playing classic lol
---
Yea, if I were Blizzard Kern's account would have some sort of flag on it to evaluate whatever he may report instantly.
---
On the stress test I was lvl 3 and I ran out and attacked a lvl 6 mob. It was an epic battle and right when I thought I got him, he dodged, no biggie heroic strike is up, parry, oh no....
---
Yeah, the fact that the toons will be wiped today so there was no possibility of repercussion was what bothered me the most.
---
And this wasn't at peak time. I was pretty much the only person in the cave, or so I thought.
---
I see this too. I think the problem is the original formatting uses the new code block formatting that only works on the reddit redesign, but Old Reddit puts it all on one line. Try viewing the original formatting attempt in incognito mode, it should look right then.
---
Just like that Private Server Theif over there.
---
At least there is an option!
---
I just timed this on stress test took almost exactly 10 minutes from valley of tauraje and trained up, but I was cautious with how far I ran before dying in purpose. Could cut a minute off if you know where exactly the cutoff is for each GY
---
I hate it mainly because I stopped pc gaming when I stopped playing wow mid BC. I tried to play the stress test yesterday and the client says [This](https://i.imgur.com/TtlJpgp.jpg) when I try to open it. Sorry for the quality I took it on my phone last night just to whatsapp to a friend.
---
Guess I need a new card even though it ran fine on vanilla and runs fine on pservers.
---
Discovering that a boat could take you to kalimdor from the Eastern Kingdoms. My mind was blown, I had thought that place was only for the horde.
---
I was so damn excited, it was a whole new world to explore
---
Compared to the 30-60 second fight, 5-10% extra time for stackable vendorables is extremely good, especially early on. Have you leveled with-without it? It was life changing for me. Plethora of gold for abilities
---
I always saw people talking in global/trade chat saying "respec" and I thought they were using an abbreviation of "respect" and not "re-specialize." took me like a year to figure that out.
---
I got to play for 3 minutes. Killed some plainstriders in the fields of Mulgore, was nice.
---
no different than any other monday
---
Warriors at least get plate at 40. I remember it being awesome dinging 40 in vanilla to get plate armor.
---
Grinded the starting zone to scratch my itch. I don't want to invest a bunch of time since the toons will just be deleted anyway.
---
Oh I didn't know Korn will have a new album on 13th of September. I never really liked Korn much when I was younger but the last album was pretty good. 
---
Slipknot on the other hand... Let's just say that their recent music and my taste doesn't have much in common.
---
You‚Äôd be wrong üòÅ
---
Buffs should generate threat (warriors use battle shout to do so).  This is only if either of you are in combat when you give the buff.  If combat was instigated afterwards, no threat should be given to you.
---
Also mob pathing and overall AI is better due to the legion client, so that's probably the biggest thing preventing front-stabbing/shredding from working.
---
I'm look at this at work so I can't react out loud, but I found myself muttering to myself "whaaaaat. This is fucking aaaaaawesome."
---
This has already been posted
---
My first death as a human warrior was in Westfall in Vanilla. When I released however my spirit was taken to a graveyard in Duskwood...a place I haven't been to. Obviously, I wanted to find my body so I started walking and got lost. Then I figured I would just spirit Rez at the graveyard however I was LOST.  I looked for my body or the graveyard for hours (including logging out for breaks). 
---
All of this could have been prevented if I just knew that ‚ÄòM‚Äò opened up the map. And that right clicking the map zoomed out.
---
Well, not even last night's storm could wake you. I heard them say we've reached Morrowind, I'm sure they'll let us go.
---
A demon raid on Stormwind and Grom'gol would be a great way to announce that Kazzak was up. Missed opportunity, that one.
---
Glorious!!
---
How do I use a wallpaper like this on windows 10? Damn that is cool
---
It's been a while since we've had one of those.  Guess you can say...
---
Boys are back in town!
---
Very minor but the first Shaman totem quest in Valley of Trials is still bugged; when you complete it the quest window doesn't go away on its own.
---
Oh okay, for a second I though you know what you are talking about
---
What does Grobbulus look like
---
I just really hope to find out what server he is on before launch so I can roll on a different one. I don‚Äôt mind asmon at all but the last thing I want in classic is being on a server with that community.
---
I wouldn't say it's that clear, but we'll see. I think Searing Gorge and Silithus should be areas that one can level in - for 1.12-"complete experience".
---
Holy shit I was just hoping I'd get to see these today, my hands are shaking from wanting more news lol... if these are real, I'm gonna be hella disappointed I can't have a main on Makrik, I'm locked into PVP
---
You are obviously clueless, rend buffs wont have any CD on classic. the nef/ony head will. Reguarding WF vs nothing thats also practically what it is when it comes to dmg output (alliance have 100 AP from pally buff) which is nwhere CLOSE to wf proccs if you know how to play and bait them properly (which us clearly dont). Don't comment on stuff you have no fucking idea about haha. "lul"

If you want to rain on a semi-serious level then ya, you'll probably need to heal. Casually, here and there, or as a part of PuG groups? You'll probably be fine though, again, Healing will get you a spot muuuuuch faster.
---
Dungeons? No one cares what spec you are. Knock yourself out, boo.
---
Presuming there's two of every server type for NA....hope to god there are Alliance streamers that feel the same way otherwise they're fucked. No one sane will roll Alliance on that shit once word gets out. Gonna be a cho'gal situation. (At one point in its history it had a 1:34 imbalance, for anyone wondering.)
---
Yeah my first main ever was a Druid. Had no idea about "min/max" or any of that shit.
---
I just wanted to be able to pinch do anything. Had loads of fun
---
With that being said I'll be going Rogue first this time around ha

Can anyone get BigDebuffs to work?

yeah I dont know why they deleted mine...

Also me:

&gt;potentially powerful at outlasting other classes in pvp
---
No need to take it personally mate.
---
Don‚Äôt worry about catching people, frost shock is king.
---
You will have a harder time finding groups as enhance than you would as resto.
---
Yeah I mean I know people is excited, for some is worth it, but others dont see it that way, glad you enjoyed it mate
---
I wouldn‚Äôt base anything around raiding at all, haven‚Äôt even mentioned radioing here as i want to do some quests and some dungeons and generally have a good time.
---
For warriors you're going to run back and forth and hit the resurrect button too
---
no function keys?
---
what
---
I never found an addon, but in playing the stress test last night, spells were being cast on key press by default. Not sure if that was intended or not, but I had a few people test it and get the same thing.
---
Just farm the defias wizards near that stone place in Elwynn. You can just make a circle around and never have to wait for respawns. Get tailoring to 30 and just pump all cloth into Brown Linen Robes. DE all of them and hopefully you get some lesser magic essence. Keep doing that and you can pump out a lot of wands.

Absolutely agree about flag running, was easily my favourite thing to do in vanilla!
---
They should've made a dueling tournament over who gets to kill the mob.
---
Still wish we could have 10 man Strat back, but I get it.

So people think Enhance Windfury is hilarious but to me it‚Äôs pretty unrealistic to get off frequently. Ele is consistently a powerhouse, often brought to premades. They‚Äôre fun as hell.
---
In raids you pretty much have to heal. Ele is of the highest burst in the game but your mana game is horrid so it‚Äôs not viable. You can raid as a Resto/Ele build though that‚Äôs still good in PvP 
---
Enhance in pve is just auto attack and dropping totems. Raids might take one. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it

Really hoping they release what timezone each server is set it as well.

 **Dire Maul** .  That was the only one I remember trying to do over 5 man after having full 60s and remembered that was not possible.  I had a 7 player friend clique that rolled together.  So, I can't commented on shitty, scummy alliance dungeons like deadmines, but if you are right you are right.
---
Blew my mind that dynamic respawn was actually blizzlike all along
---
hell yeah brothers. all of my answers are what the majority of ppl chose too.
---
This was the case for the Oceanic server during stress test since it was named Swamp of Sorrow.
---
***ahhh they took my kidney***
---
He's saying that the dynamic spawn rate on private servers weren't blizzlike, so the people arguing that they weren't blizzlike were partially correct.  Yes them existing in some fashion is clearly blizzlike, but the private server version was not.  Which literally could not be more relevant to what you posted.
---
Yeah so it's a bunch of retail babies that have to just guess at what community means and then make posts like these that have nothing to do with community.

Oh, up by the Stone Cairn Lake. Thanks! I didn't even think of those. I know the bandits that hang out near Stormwind don't really drop any linen, so I wondered how people could be getting any reasonable amount of it. :') Questing and killing everything in sight only netted me 21 linen by level 10 (nearly 11) so I knew I was doin' something wrong!

I'm guessing so.

There is probably a difference between Realm List Leaked and 'Potential' Realm List for US. The latter isn't confirmed.

Raid were widely regarded as the best part of WoD, lol. Pretty much the only content besides garrisons in the xpac, and they were well designed.

Ok thanks, some people say that i must get a spirit armor set in my inventory just in case, but i have trouble understanding how can i get both my enchancement set and my spirit set while leveling, shoud i buy it ? Is it only for high level ?

He spends more of the time going "yep" or "nope" to every point brought up, or just sitting there with a (obviously played up) dumb look on his face.

You're right, people can like him all they want.  I just really can't fathom why.

Thanks, did you play shaman? Which spec do you prefer?
---
It must feel great to have won that internet fight!
---
Thanks, it was a lot more readable for me. The other one showed up on a single line, and it turns out its something to do with old.reddit and the new code. If you load it in the new format it works just fine. I'm not sure if that's why you made the changes but it worked out nicely for old.reddit users.

I only played a bit of TBC on retail. Undead Rogue.

Im not saying you're wrong not to care, im just saying you should fuck off if you have nothing meaningful to add in a comment.

`local c,i,n,v=0;`

`i = {GetContainerItemInfo(b,s)}`

"Nobody quits WoW. They just take extended breaks."
---
Coming off a decade-long break myself...
---
I was early into EU, made my warr, got to 5 quick and avoided a lot of mob queues. Then my friends I was going to play alongisde had trouble getting in and logged a different server. Logged in with them, killed some things, went to bed... Spent all day today talking about everything and how much fun it was and remembering the bits we missed, and also making the others who missed the stress test super jealous.
---
Looking at that list I'm gonna say Herod and Atiesh are gonna be the big ones.
---
Oh what‚Äôs your name going to be?
---
Elemental is really strong and fun in pvp, unfortunately the sustained mana makes raiding almost impossible. Personally I‚Äôve always thought resto shaman is a blast. They are good at leveling too
---
I would just buy a white piece of gear and enchant it/overwrite the enchant. I tried going the route of doing enchants for people, but its not efficient at all.
---
Lolnub , gotta stand behind the mob so he can't parry /s
---
It means the exact amount is different per class.
---
100% will never get a server first lol and im more than fine with that. I just want to enjoy the game/chill out do some quests and dungeons with my bro and guildys. On this note i got nothing to lose and will play on 27th :) thanks!
---
The cat form is bigger than the bear form, both are smaller than tauren hitbox but bigger than every other race.
---
Grobbulus? Yuck. It's like blizzard wants to prove themself right and make the only RPPVP server flop. Who the heck wants to be play on a server called Grobbulus?
---
Ideally 7, so I'm one short like that
---
What does Marsellus Wallace look like?
---
RemindMe! 20 days
---
Sure, if you want to go full prot that's fine. It just isnt really necessary is all. You can do a great job tanking without going all the way to shield slam, even in MC. MS is a good rage dump ability and does good damage. I just think the arms build is more versatile and fun than going prot. If you search around, you start to see many warriors agreeing that the prot tree past the Defiance tier is lack luster, at least in the initial phases. I dont have any experience in anything more than MC and pvp.
---
This and that are two completely separate things.  You're trying to appeal to an extreme when it's not that simple.
---
Capitalism is king I got what you want you got what I need
---
New to the classic wow sub? Someones gonna snag your name! xD lol. Nice! I'm going with My warrior because I only got him to about level 20 (in vanilla I'd say that aint so bad especially not being my account). But id like to get the whole vanilla experience with him that I never did. See you in azeroth!
---
Good answer i liked this. If in interested in druid then yeah i will play druid!
---
I didn't play with it much, but nameplates are extremely limited for classic, intentionally. I don't think they're able to handle debuffs, timers, etc.
---
Classic looks better in my opinion.
---
I only started WoW in legion and I figured I'd just give Classic the old college try and go back to retail. But digging into guides and playing the stress test has made me hyped beyond belief for Classic and I couldn't care less about retail now. Launch can't come soon enough!
---
Looks great!
---
Thanks so much. Yes I have them for sale at Clackeys.com. Cheers!

I fucking love this.
---
Warcraft lore literally *started* with other worlds. Orcs came from Draenor.
---
Isn't there supposed to be a column where they say if it's an east/west coast server?  Or are they not going to have that?
---
[deleted]
---
This isn't really true when it comes to Feral. There are definitely issues with the specs (Cat &amp; Bear) when compared to Rogue/Warrior but you aren't really telling the whole picture.
---
1) Bears go into MC way stronger than Warrior as their Pre-BiS is better and far easier to acquire
---
Bear Pre-raid BiS is a joke to acquire compared to warrior, very few people want it so no competition, and chances are you will be 60 before most warriors if you play consistently. Going into MC you might not be the most optimal MT on every fight, but there's 3-4 tanks you don't need to be MT (Although you would be optimal on quite a bit if talking just TPS, bosses like Shazz, Luci, Gehennas) while still being extremely useful (Can decurse on Shazz/Gehennas if not needed as MT) (Can OT for Garr, tons of trash, Gehennas, Luci, Golemagg, Sulfuron, Majordomo). BWL isn't your strongest, but still useful on Vael. From AQ40 onwards you are extremely useful for you ability to switch between OT and Heal without needing to change the raid group.
---
2) Cats go into MC pretty strong
---
MCP is your BiS weapon and Wolfshead is your BiS helm and you are getting them right at the start. Early gear also heavily favors you and the fights work out pretty well. Going into BWL onwards it starts to be a bit rough, and it does require time investment for consumes, but you will do just fine (Hours in MCP is a bit of an exaggeration. It's 15 minutes for 5 runs, you can probably spend 3 hours over the course of a week and be fine, assuming you have none stockpiled from early P1). 
---
3) You should never run HotW spec during leveling. 
---
0/30/21 is useless pre 60 as you don't need any of the resto tree to heal dungeons and you end up missing out on a lot of good DPS talents. Respeccing to HotW at 60 is doable, but it's not a great spec early game for PvE raids, you'll just be way too gimped. It doesn't help you get into dungeons easier, as you could just heal in deep feral and no one would notice. It's doable for sure in early raids, but honestly should just stick to Feral or Resto until AQ imo.
---
4) Cat consumes are annoying, but they aren't going to destroy your sanity
---
Cats bring the exact same consumes as any melee, except that they need mana pots/demonic runes/MCPs. That's the only difference. Mana pots will be really useful, aren't terribly pricey, and can be reduced to very little if you just drink between pulls. Demonic runes are annoying to farm for sure, but can be knocked out in one day and you'll have enough for a few weeks. MCPs are nowhere near as bad as people think, it's 15 minutes for 5 runs. At 60 just log off in IF or SW, when you log on do a couple runs, when you are about to get off do a couple runs. It adds up quickly and you can also stockpile them in your bank for most of P1/2. Locks have to get on and soul shard farm, MCPs are basically just that for us.
---
Just bank them before you click!
---
Why not? You don‚Äôt have to run them. No one is forcin you. So why remove something that used to be there just because YOU don‚Äôt want to do something totally optional?
---
For sure, we got the two hardest spots filled.
---
Could you adjust the Classic settings to the Classic preconfig and post comparaisons? Thanks
---
It's literally the best name on the list.
---
Druids get a lot of overrated love for flag carrying. Yes, it's one of the most fun things you can do as a Druid. I love it - one of my most favorite parts. Against 1-2 chases, yes, Druids are the best. But for organized Warsong? Take the prot war, let him hold it, and I can peel 3-4 people off of him while keeping the both of us alive.
---
Most people enjoy running the flag. If you can root one person, charge/immobilize another, bash a 3rd, while tossing rejuvs + NS HT + Abolish/decurse on the carrier, you'll get as much love as you would running the flag (and likely dying, as alliance, you can't pop a FAP because a sham just purges it instantly).
---
I wish those locked servers were for the streamers and then unlocked for their communities a few days after just so the rest of us could be rid of this shit.
---
Tons of addons autosell greys and output summary to chat though.  I think leatrix does, for starters.
---
&gt;[https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/leatrix-plus-classic](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/leatrix-plus-classic)  
---
&gt;I sent them an email about adding auto-dismount though there is an auto-dismount addon already.   But it has the sell junk, auto repair, auto quest accept / turnin, and more.
---
You mean the stress test, where there was one server?
---
Thanks! I don't worry too much about pve. It's pvp i'm looking forward to the most. And I've tried a bit on private servers and i keep messing up rotations and keybinds etc. I guess i just need more practice :) 
---
Yeah, I had this great plan on creating a guild for our group of friends and their friends but now that we're getting closer several are joining other guilds and some are just not that interested in classic anymore, so it is looking like my plan won't go through. 8 players aren't enough for a guild, but maybe I'll take up your advice and find new friends on the server and get them to join. I mean, that's what it's all about, right? :)
---
Seemed like many of that addons had even more problems than the previous stress test.  A bunch of them messed up my UI in major ways such as making the chat window not work or hiding the player frame.  Doesn't matter too much until higher end content but would be nice if more of these worked.
---
When I hit 20 on my 1st character I got bored questing and thought I‚Äôd go find all the fp‚Äôs.  I made it all the way to UC and thought it looked amazing, well until I went in and was flattened by the guardsüò≥.  That was my first experience w the horde.
---
Yeah and when it enables it acts like nameplates are there, the mob names go away but it's invisible I'll just wait for a updated version built for classic later nbd as I'm lvlin pally first

1/6 chance you end up on a streamer server, I don't like those odds. Here's hoping Asmon, Soda, Venruki &amp; the rest coordinate and all play on the same server and tell us.

I'd really like to know which one is gonna be the Brazilian server. That's more important to avoid than Asmongold.

who knows if its even legit

‚Äú10 man deadmines is the core of why we wanted classic wow‚Äù

Oh fuck off
---
That Frayed Robe was BiS on my very first char for at LEAST lvls 2&amp;3 :)
---
probably smells better than his room does &gt;&lt;
---
It‚Äôs actually been amazingly smooth and zero lag. There were only three servers and the PvP one had a short queue time. I‚Äôm thinking the launch will be smooth thanks to their modern infrastructure and layering. At least I hope it will be.
---
Mankirk for PVE
---
You wouldn't, but you'd expect them to in your VC run.
---
How long is the stress test going today? I logged on this morning and played and I‚Äôm hoping I can play more tonight.
---
&gt;I‚Äôm saying the pet doesn‚Äôt attack yellow mobs even if they‚Äôre wacking me.  
---
That looks like a pet not consistently behaving as it should.
---
I'm sure there was a Penny Arcade comic about this once.
---
They do. Try it out :)
---
It's a bit of a grind, took us 40 minutes to farm 60 linen off gnolls and undead in tirisfal glades.
---
Busted!
---
I can confirm doing 10 man deadmines in 2005.
---
Quiet. Here comes the guard.
---
please play the whole warcraft 3 campaign before classic!!!
---
I distinctly remember the second stress test respawn rates feeling waaaaay lower than what I remember from vanilla.  And there are old devs on twitch who said it existed properly in vanilla.
---
Damn skippy! It's gonna be too easy to find groups for dungeons at first lol but we got that pre made! You playing with friends? Going solo?

/aap wasn't working for me but /aap skip and /aap reset did work. I had TukUI installed though so I'm not sure that messes with it.
---
&gt; Why?

Because it's a game.

At the moment, yes.
---
Some of the best shamans are still debating what is better, so go with the heart I'd say. Tauren is pretty underrated.
---
I uploaded a screen of me getting 90-100 frames. I don't think it matters for my monitors, but it was flying

Sounds like you had a pally pet.

For NA it matters, in EU not as much.

Pancakes

2 pvp realms damn
---
Oh boyz... only 5 (normal) PVP Servers in total for the EU? (Devided by Language)
---
U gotta be kidding me...
---
92c and no level requirement to get the knife and skill. Keep in mind if you plan to do this. Be a shame to get all the way there and not have the copper.
---
I'd like to say I have hope in blizzard but it's always in my mind they'll find a way to fuck it up.
---
Where does one find this map... was it included in a strat guide?
---
Yup which isn‚Äôt intended
---
don't bring logic into this request! how dare you!
---
Hmm okay I think you've got me going druid over shaman... I've historically played NE but think I'll go Tauren this time (I feel that warstop will help, and no shaman purging)
---
You go engineering? Take blacksmithing for fear trinket? Enchanting for the trinket? :)
---
Sorry for all the questions haha
---
No German and French RP servers, after the RP communities on both of those language forums were amongst the loudest calls for language specific servers. I *so* hope that this isn't final and they add at least RP PvE servers.

Dev plague or shadow orbs just seem to be to good to turn down, as I love shadow be pvp haha

If I go horde I'm rolling troll hunter so I'll feel your pain! Lol
---
Nice man, feel free to DM if you have issues. ( not sure what your technical skill is, but im happy to help )
---
Addons require updates, this macro never will :)
---
I knew they were going to woefully underestimate how many servers they'd need.
---
This particular bug wasn‚Äôt a thing in vanilla , as a warlock then
---
You'd better do what they say.
---
Yeah they are both pretty close run times. I think if anyone wants a head start on funds they should make the corpse run to Camp Taurajo, but those that want to make good time leveling should wait til they naturally make their way into Orgrimmar.

Grobbulus
---
Immortal was a bigger one
---
So I'm considering going Druid or Paladin for my main. I'm leaning towards Druid due to faster/easier/funner leveling, but I've got concerns about endgame desirability/viability. Specifically the lack of out of combat res for dungeons, and lack of healing throughput for raids. I'm not so concerned with PvP as I won't be doing too much of that. Are my concerns well founded, or will I have no problems getting groups?
---
Grobby life

cant wait to 40man ubrs in my 1.12 gear

The names aren't what everyone would have wanted, but at least we have servers.

I was planning solo, couldn‚Äôt find any of my old guildies.  How fast are you planning on levelling?
---
This is not enough lmao.
---
I had to turn on the colorblind option to 20% and lower the brightness on my monitor. Something about the brightness and the contrast and hues of color used gave me a headache and hurt my eyes. It‚Äôs pretty much perfect now, colors remind me much more of vanilla now.
---
I play rogue off tank, it‚Äôs a meme, but effective. After some BWL gear I can tank 5 man dungeons.
---
Pitbull not working for me either, variety of errors. I just want a unit frame addon that works and doesnt look like shit (Zperl)
---
Sorry I'm not cool or whatever but can anyone explain the joke for me?
---
For the horde!
---
It has always worked. Maybe try it before you say otherwise.
---
i think you are right... i was using /pat not pet :D
---
Always have your pet on passive and use the attack command
---
Either way its gonna be a blast! Have fun!
---
 Indeed defensive pet stance isn't working like it used to back in vanilla. I haven't played retail since WotLK but after googling it seems like pet aggressive stance was removed at some point in retail and changed into assist stance instead. Defensive was changed when this happened into pet attacking only after you took damage, not when you damaged a mob like it used to be in vanilla.
---
 Since classic is based on retail client this affected the way it worked in classic too. So we have defensive stance acting like retail as a result. When messing around with macros I noticed as well that there is no command for /petaggressive like it should. Only /petpassive and /petdefensive works. A result of retail client.
---
 It's an annoying change since personally I don't want to macro in /petattack into my abilities. Screws up things when you are engaging several mobs at once. You don't always want the pet attacking the mob you are casting a spell on.
---
 I will probably just end up using passive all the time. Even when mindlessly grinding.
---
I remember freaking out when I got 100 copper and it converted to 1 silver.  I don't know why, but that level of detail was really cool to me as most games I had played up until then had flat gold, gil, credits etc.
---
I used to be a Night Elf Rogue, and now I am going to play an undead mage
---
FOR THE HORDE! trolls unite.
---
blame caverns of time for that, since most of the WoD stuff was basically a giant CoT dungeon
---
i made a mistake it was prolly /pat
---
Nice
---
Only two English PvP relams? Well at least I don't have to worry about playing with my old friends.
---
Am I the only one who thinks the EU server names suck!? Compared to the US ones.
---
Yes Dire Maul was unique in that it was only ever a 5 man dungeon
---
thank you!

WoD had better class design and the mythic raids were really good.
---
Way less BS around titanforging etc.
---
Some of the names sound a little... lackluster? 
---
Like who wants to say they‚Äôre on ‚ÄúFairbanks‚Äù, a name that sounds like a corporate thinktank, based on a minor lore character in a hidden room?
---
"You're opinion that you enjoy this game is wrong."
---
Lol. Get over yourself dude.
---
Imagine having 5 realms and ignoring cst
---
Not only the name reservation will be a disaster...
---
The leaks are wrong.
---
Yea sadly i might not actually even bother with rpvp now.  Really should have been CST to be fair
---
I remember for bc lk and cata we planned a big lan ordeal just to sit around and stare at a que screen till 2am.
---
It was so damn fun last night. After all these years seeing so many people start fresh
---
Can't wait
---
Do ppl actually care about their server name?
---
Yes it was 10 man originally and turned to 5 man in patch 1.10 with the release of the dungeon set quests
---
bfa is not a mmo.
---
Pretty awful names NGL.
---
Druid was my very first [character](http://www.warcraftrealms.com/charsheet/13272281) in vanilla and was my main through Molten Core &amp; BWL. I plan on recreating him and doing it all again.
---
The official bluepost was already linked
---
Im so glad for it to be announced. But whats up with the names? US gets awesome names, seems like EU got screwed on naming.
---
UBRS quests could always be completed in a raid so they were fine. LBRS quests, like the first bit of Horde Ony attunement, were not and had to be completed in a 5 man group. Same went for Strath, Scholo, etc. The ‚Äúmeta‚Äù was to run those in 10 man groups and then run them in a 5 man group if you wanted to do quests like the Barov quests. And because everyone was used to running them as a 10 man group, it was pretty dang hard to run them as a 5 man group.
---
Good luck avoiding streamers.  I knew it would be that few.  Layering is here to stay.

This is beyond epic. Thank you for this!
---
MANKIRK MASTER REALM, FALL IN FOR ACCOUNT.
---
This was already posted
---
To be honest, that RP PvP realm likely cost EU a normal PvP realm.
---
I can kind of understand why they were sceptical now.
---
For real. The arrows/play functions on the keys are sweet
---
They don't have Dallas servers anymore so no CST most likely.
---
A design choice with no mention of it being so elsewhere, unlike talents, mount costs etc
---
Unless stated as intentional, it‚Äôs a big
---
Yes. Although it matter less now with cable internet being so prevalent, it still helps.
---
r/holdmyfeedingtube
---
Or if it's gray or grey
---
nah
---
because after 18 months of classic and classic design philosophy, a large portion of the playerbase will be tired of it. or burned out. and ready for something different. something we call 'TBC'
---
and those who want more, they'll follow in the footsteps of a large portion of the private server community, and continually replay the same content for fun
---
Eu has better names. Na blows their best name on pve
---
already posted
---
Anyone know which server is going to be the Brazilian server?
---
Its Thanos
---
My main worry with this few servers is it won‚Äôt be possible to avoid streamers :/
---
A true warrior never back down !
---
You can also make about 8-10g/h in desolace aoe farming the low health hyenas. Decent XP too, so what i do, is start at 37-38 and grind to 40 with plenty of money at 40 for mount and any skills i may still lack. Ofc you need an AoE spec for it, but its definitely worth respeccing.
---
The best part is, 80% of the gold comes from vendors, so no need to rely on AH or good drops doing it.
---
Link for the mobs: [https://classicdb.ch/?npc=4688#drop](https://classicdb.ch/?npc=4688#drop)
---
You sir are a genius
---
I'm pretty happy they only have 1 RP-PVP realm, because then it makes my choice easy!
---
LMFAO FUCK BLIZZARD
---
no central time servers :(
---
It's not about the launch, it's about when phase 2 hits and they remove layering the servers are gonna have 4k queues
---
Herod will be the most pop US Realm. Calling it.
---
https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1107332-wow-classic-realm-names-and-types/
---
This is already being spammed.
---
Also wow horrible formatting
---
All I did was run \`nvidia-settings\` and change the image quality. I could have changed frame limitation, but I was just experimenting. I'm sure turning off those limits would get you up to 150 ez. For actual gameplay, I'll have my frames limited to 60fps, since I have some butt monitors. So yeah like you said the extra frames beyond that wont matter for me.
---
I personally really like Manjaro for my everyday PC - gaming / browsing / light development at home. For an arch flavor it is really user friendly, but some people don't like xfce as a desktop environment. If you wanted to put i3 or some other WM on it, I would start from bare bones arch (architect or something).
---
Yes, we already know
---
Makes sense but unless I‚Äôm mistaken shadowmeld is more than just a way to eat, it‚Äôs like an additional vanish, to be able to reset on your opponent is pretty important and it can also be used defensively to avoid that huge pyro spell being casted on you. 
---
War stomp can be resisted too which sucks.
---
Some people like to do quests, aint nothing wrong with it.  I prefer to grind myself.
---
Shit, only Pacific or Eastern? We have people on both sides, were hoping for mountain or at least central
---
Was the wh40k verse really the same as the wh fantasy verse? I liked to think so but never saw any proof. (excited to be proven wrong!)
---
that's the point. if you do it earlier, it's supposed to be harder, and the payoff is you keep it for awhile and get that powerspike earlier
---
Blue post with realm list:
---
Alright
---
Don't want to imagine the queues if they don't add any more servers when they go to remove layering.
---
1.14 content confirmed
---
This probably comes down to personal preference, I know, but this has been bugging me since the Classic announcement. After trying the Stress Test yesterday I still have no idea if I should play Tauren or Orc shaman.
---
I played a Tauren Shaman in Vanilla, I like their racials and for nostalgia reasons it feels like the obvious choice to relive the old Vanilla days. However, back in the days I remembered always glancing at my Orc friend envying his nimble and more "responsive" character compared to my giant and clunky Tauren. Especially in PvP. I often wondered to myself "Why didn't I just roll an orc?"
---
**tl;dr:** My heart says Tauren but my head says Orc. Anyone care to share some wisdom on this matter?
---
Yes and most other people will be on the same time zone as you which makes it easier to organize
---
Holy, shit this is an absolute disaster for a lot of people.
---
Not only will these servers be absolutely unplayable, or Blizzard will never remove layering.
---
But they completely didn't consider CST at all.
---

Planning on joining the RP-PVP realm, but wow  Grobbulus is a weird name.
---
Such a shame that their voices went from 'two packs a day' in Morrowind to 'bubbly and British' in Skyrim.
---
Faerlina for me
---
Herod will be the most populated. Bet.
---
A lot of things are in that don‚Äôt make any sense at all.
---
That's such a dumb comment. Anybody with a quarter of a brain can understand the point being made.
---
Same. I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs just an uncreative troll trying to get their 3 hours of jollies before the list releases.
---
No where did I say that but please feel free to quote it if you find it. The fact that you got this defensive from my opinion of the story and game design goes to show that you‚Äôve heard the same criticism countless times. Probably because it‚Äôs pretty universally known at this point just how awesome the class design is or the Azerite system is or the warfronts and island expeditions and so on ;)
---
13 servers
---
Mirage Raceway sounds like a knockoff pay2win private.
---
I'm not sure why it did that.  Replaced with an image
---
Yeah ManKRIK sounds real legit.
---
2 realms rip
---
Because nobody's actually going to do it even if Blizz increases the cap.
---
Some people are tired of pointless nitpicking and would prefer if Blizz focused on things that matter.
---
Yeah I honestly do believe that the server name has influence on player numbers.
---

To those that cant get luna to run. Got to addons folder and delete the "-master" at the end of luna folder
---
Why are you here posting if you can‚Äôt answer the question ? Bnet is clunky and annoying to open and sometimes even update
---
Actually, I'm pretty sure they're designed to be completed by 10 people in vanilla, as that is the actual way they were...in vanilla...
---
What skills do paladins really have to train during lvling except for the seal?
---
If that's the case, what's stopping them keeping layering?
---
hey! I do what I want, okay?
---
what the fuck man use your brain for a second
---
In retail they only have servers in LA and Chicago right now.
---
You have to realize that its way easier to add servers if need be then to take servers away and transfer people off.
---
So layering will be around forever with this little servers.
---
LMFAO 5 NA pvp realms, I'm in tears of laughter
---
Why are you here posting to not answer the question?
---
One can dream
---
What do you mean?  Name reservation lasts until launch, you have weeks.
---
He went all that way for that joke? That's commitment.
---
an add on that literally runs the same lua code your macro does, automatically when you open a vendor will never require an update either.
---
Well its been up for 29 minutes so I would say negative 28 minutes.
---
FeelsEUman.
---
Vanilla realms population was between 10-12k. Classic will have Vanilla-like population (maybe slightly higher), as stated by Ion, Omar, and others.
---
Hence, 10 realms = 100k-120k, or a bit higher, up to 150k.
---
These are the numbers Blizzard expects for EU today.
---
I'm honestly wondering how Blizzard thinks that this amount of realms is even close to being enough.
---
2 English PvP realms? Uhm.... That shit is either gonna explode or they're gonna need 100 layers. And good luck ever getting rid of layering with that amount of players.
---
Like it's just stupid. No shit they needed layering if they planned this amount of servers. Come on man.
---
Only 2 classified as English
---
That website just led me down a rabbit hole of nostalgia. Thank you so much!
---
Lol what do you suggest? 50 servers? There‚Äôs layering and people will be more spread out once you exit the first few starter zones. It was packed in the stress test but it wasn‚Äôt like the quests were not doable.
---
Mirage Raceway is where I'll probably end up on. Though I much prefer the US names like Pagle and Atiesh.
---
omg I hope the brazilians are on fairbanks. 
---
i love big dicks and feijoada
---
Grobbulus is looking *really* good to me. I think it's going to be very popular.
---
It‚Äôs not a ‚Äúthis is important and I demand they fix it‚Äù kind of complaining. It‚Äôs a ‚Äúwell... that‚Äôs kind of lame and underwhelming, but whatever‚Äù kind of complaining. Meanwhile, I think a more legitimate complaint is the number of servers; two weeks of layering is a thing of the past with a number that small.
---
Yeah i am going to try this one today.
---
They never said only 3 layers per server. If the population drops less than they expect they‚Äôll just open up more servers and have free transfers.
---
There are plenty of trash pulls in plenty of dungeons that require at least 3 CCs. If you have to manage that with only 3, that narrows the viable classes in vanilla.  Not everyone has a CC like that.
---
As strictly a role player that makes my choice real easy.
---
Every horde PvE player is going there.  Horde pop there might break 40% total population!
---
Im sure they have more servers capable of being spun up in the event that there is a demand for it.
---
That's a great idea!
---
I enjoy his videos as well. He seems to want to enjoy the game the way it is, as opposed to some youtubers who always end up nagging and complaining over random things.
---
Love it
---
Any German or French players here? How large a portion of the German or French playerbase are actually gonna roll on their language specific servers? In my experience most gamers from all European countries want to roll in English anyway
---
Ill test it out today and get back to you!
---
I always thought balance was the least bad druid spec for raids. What's better?
---
&gt; also something about 10-15man raids essentially allowing players to abuse instances by not having to actually play, just rolling through for loot.
---
Like 40-manning Onyxia
---
Okay, then make that distinction. They have 5 total. Not everyone speaks english, or wants to speak english in their game
---
I'm sorry you wont be able to be boosted through deadmines by 9 other people as if it were LFR.
---
But Thalnos looks like Thanos if you squint. That's a big pro.
---
Ping will not be great but probably doable. I'm more concerned about missing prime time because I'll be going to bed when everyone on the West Coast is in the middle of their gaming sessions.
---
Blizz needs to just put it in Chicago and call it a Central server since it's going to have people from all over the country playing on it.
---
lok'tar ogar, motherfuckers!
---
find out and tell us
---
it is tho
---
You're so right, who wouldn't want to spent weeks leveling on a max queued realm just to redo it all five weeks later when they figured out there was too few servers. :lul:
---
Do you think Blizzard would give out free server transfer if it does happen?
---
Ignore the old delusional man. He thinks he knows the metrics better than Blizzard.
---
Probably
---
This idea is really the only way classic can survive long term.
---
You can call Blizz out if they use layering past phase 1.
---
I really don‚Äôt see any difference my man
---
Thalnos will be balanced as all thing should be
---
They certainly seem to be giving it the absolute bare minimum of resources until its too late
---
Now all i need to know is what server the streams are going to so i can avoid that one.
---
no central time pvp server 
---
D:&lt;
---
The two English PvP servers will have like 20-30k+ population EASILY. 
---
I'm not sure how Blizzard will even get rid of layering on those servers.
---
What will be the server?
---
Name alone I am leaning towards Herod
---
Not necessarily. Blizzard has historically not matched time zone with datacenter location. That said, any NA server should have reasonable ping if you‚Äôre in NA
---
&gt; Where are you getting these numbers from, do you have a source?
---
???
---
The source is the realm list linked above at the top of this very thread.
---
You sir are an idiot
---
[Discord Server](https://discord.gg/ahJ8j3) for `Whitemane` PVP Pacific Time.
---
Make sure to let everyone know where you and the others are going because most people wanna avoid the big streamer's community. Stream snipers that wanna ruin your experience will figure out your server on launch anyways. Some of us wanna get going when server launch and dont wanna wait an extra 10-15 minutes for people to figure it out and let everyone know.
---
Absolutely not too late, it just cant be enough. Well know how many more well get at 13th
---
2 pvp servers for english speakers? Seems like enough
---
it‚Äôs happening!
---
But lol at these side chick server names Blizz is giving us. Reserving the cool ones for retail I guess.
---
Makes no sense, so Germany+France = Uk+Benulux + Scandinavia and the Baltics, Balkans, Spain + Portugal and Italy top kek. Well at least we won't have to worry about finding a guild or filling a guild. but those queue times are going to be pain.
---
 Don‚Äôt want to sound like a pessimist or a d*ck, but 5 pvp servers? No chance. Blizz has more servers at the press of a button , guaranteed.  
---
From Aug 12th to launch I expect more servers to be revealed
---
EU PvE server names are dreadful. Not that it matters, but.. you know.
---
So, this made it easy for me.  
---
Two criteria:
---
NA - PVP - Pacific 
---
and
---
Not Asmongolds server . . .
---
Doubt they go there. If they're smart they go to one with a shitty name.
---
There have been like 300 more comments after I left mine. At the time of writing it was 80% about Asmon specifically and 20% about streamers in general.
---
I just made an observation, I'm a random nobody. Not "shilling" for anyone so please calm your tatas and don't let this ruin your evening.
---
Do they literally think that ~20K people are gonna play WoW Classic at launch?
---
It‚Äôs almost as if Blizzard have gone ‚Äúlet‚Äôs shut them up and give them classic, but we‚Äôre not expecting anyone to play it so just stick 10 servers on it and give them the language specialised ones as they‚Äôve been asking‚Äù
---
I‚Äôm not joking when I say this, MORE PEOPLE WILL PLAY CLASSIC THAN RETAIL 
---
And they‚Äôre all shit names too, what an absolute joke this is. Disgraceful behaviour by Blizzard this
---
They're in Austin, TX mostly I believe, which is CST. I didn't hear that, but that makes sense. Streamers can pass viewers back and forth and keep the loop closed/sell your hosts (theoretically of course) more optimally that way, I would think.
---
Cool I did BT 25 times in TBC and never saw a warglaive drop, doesn't mean they don't exist
---
Disney taking over all universes
---
The game is basically 1.12 from the day it launches.  There is no ‚Äúin phase one it should be...‚Äù because we have the talents and balances of 1.12 so we also have things like the caps.
---
Playing on a PvP server automatically makes you a better gamer, apparently.
---
remember 2 things
---
getting a profession and a skinning knife costs money
---
AND it requires level 5
---
so he cannot just do that at level 1
---
EU server names &gt; NA server names
---
THANK YOU!
---
Eastern servers are placed in the city most often used to reference central time? Sure
---
Most streamers will hide their realm as long as possible
---
Imagine having one RP-PvP server and not making it the middleground timezone
---
MISTAKES WERE MADE
---
Interesting that everyone complains about only 2 PvP servers, while there are also only 2 PvE servers. Oh well.
---
Personally, I'm going to trust blizzard on this one and in case the servers blow up (which they probably will) they will just open new ones, no problem. Better to play it safe.
---
No.
---
With only 5 realms they will all be full. Too early to tell where the most hardcore will go, but I‚Äôll get there are top end guilds and big name streamers on each server.
---
They should be, yes.
---
Yes I do suggest that, servers that can handle that many people are not that expensive nowadays.
---
Sure but if you read the post then you‚Äôll know that the player cap is wrong even by 1.12 standards
---
I feel they would be very slow to respond to the situation, making people be stuck on a 'dead realm'. But they could.
---
blizzard lies all the time dude
---
TLDR: Undecided
---
Oh, I will. But the fanboys will still defend them. And the excuses will be plenty.
---
Holy shit I remember this ancient meme.
---
I'm mainly going because its Eastern time zone, and the meme gods blessed me with the server.
---
Lol i went to bed as you posted this and now im logging in again, not a good sign for when classic actually hits
---
ur dissatisfaction is ur problem lol
---
Yes but it's a very popular location for gaming datacenters. Ping is good as well so I wouldn't worry about that.
---
Those fools. Until they‚Äôre right.
---
I'm guessing they're anticipating a population drop off in the few months post launch. Easier to add a new server and offer free transfers from high pop realms of that isn't the case.
---
Ahh ok so Ion the lawyer Lied then, Layering will be in forever with such little servers.
---
streamers arente announcing there servers. this list might only really be helpful in like 2 months
---
My first thought is "Absolutely not", but then again... who knows.
---
Wasn‚Äôt expecting to get great advice out of this shit thread (pun intended) but now I‚Äôve added this to my shopping cart for my fianc√©. Thanks!
---
On my warrior in deadmines I needed the ember stone staff.. to give to my mage. Turns out bind on pickup is a thing lol
---
He means in English.
---
its happening!
---
!remindme 2 months
---
You like dead servers?
---
god the chats in the stress test were absolutely awful. i think it‚Äôll just be a matter of filling up the ignore list. RPPvP won‚Äôt save it.
---
See I was getting all of that on a PVP server. Tried the RP-PVP and the interactions were night and day.  Much nicer community that I found.  Although it being a stress test, you are going to have a bunch of trolls.
---
So what? Layering is fucking garbage, they shouldn't rely even heavier on it.
---
TWO PVP REALMS FOR EU? That's gonna take dozens of layers, that's taking phasing to a whole other level.
---
Thank you for replying. I actually figured it out with some help from people in the discord. I had to make sure that the file flow went like this; World of warcraft/classic/interface/addons/Mychoosenaddonfolder/mychoosenAddon.toc file. I was creating too many folders when extracting and the .toc files were buried too deep. The game didn't register even an addon button for me.
---
Play on Emerald dream (Grob) :!
---
a lot of this doesnt help someone who plans to get on right away
---
pops wont be determined, streamers wont be decided
---
it‚Äôs always been mankrik not mankirk you just read it wrong.
---
&gt; I am glad there's only two English PvP servers -more likely to meet old friends 
---
Not if you are on 50 different layers.
---
Rename Pyrewood Village to Pyrewood!
---
Did you look at the NA server names?  EU names are a blessing in comparison.
---
Yes that's what I said.
---
If you‚Äôre in California or Nevada and you choose an EST server will you get a higher ping than a PST server?
---

---
And this is why Blizzard wont remove layering even by phase 2, too many players for such little servers. Even if nowadays it would be technologically possible to host 50k players on 1 server with only 1 layer the game isn't designed around having that many people playing on one server.
---
Made it easier to make subreddits at least. 
---
/r/golemagg and /r/shazzrah
---
If anyone has experience moderating subreddits drop me a pm and I‚Äôll sort things out tomorrow.
---
Or just add more layering. There are 2 options. One involves more money than the other.
---
What, are you allergic to asking others for help or something?
---
NA has been doing fine on pservers with that MS so it can't be that big a deal.
---
i was layer hopping. dead as fuck.
---
Maybe they were shooting for names that aren't used for servers in retail to reduce confusion? But i dunno.
---
In the US, there are some pretty classically known servers, like Illidan, Icecrown, and Darkspear. Seems like it'd be cool to go with those.
---
But even then, some of these are okay, like Whitemane, but most of these feel kinda...cheap. Like it just sounds kinda garbo.
---
"Yeah I play on Grobbulus and have an alt on Fairbanks."
---
We didn't go there though we did stop by and visit nathanos which was cool to see.
---
No CTS.... really??
---
They're planning to minimize failure, not to capitalize on succes
---
Mankrik
---
Unsubscribe.
---
what server are u playing on fat man so we can avoid it
---
It sucks because those of us that NEED to save our names won't know where the streamers will be yet anyways
---
I think you will only escape them for sure by going Normal
---
It will entirely depend on the streamer. Someone like Summit will probably be gone in a month.
---
Spell batching reduces the issues with higher ping.
---
I am not telling you how to work around the bug.
---
This is how you should be using your pet at all times. Always have it on passive and follow...always
---
Were the locked servers in the leak reserved for you guys? Asking for a friend bby
---
It's a PTR test account, or it's an account from recruit a friend.
---
Sounds like a shitty friend.
---
Oh I definitely agree, I'd rather be on a decently large server but I can't help the gut feeling that Blizzard is really lowballing their projected number of players. I'm not saying hundreds of thousands of people will be playing, but when you pidgeonhole people into a small selection of servers, you end up with them being wildly overpopulated, the future will tell whether or not that's a good time or if I'll hate it.
---
It seems like they are all planning on going on one server now, after they all had fun together on the beta. Most of them are doing their own guilds and recruiting. They will likely tell their guild members where to reserve their names. It'll get leaked.
---
Except they‚Äôve already said they will not keep layering in the game long term, and essentially the entire playerbase is opposed to that option.
---
I like Garlic and Bread so I might just roll on the French server. I can't speak French so I'll let the funky music do the talking talking, Now Oh.
---
Really surprised about the RP PvP. Something like Scarlet Crusade, Defias Brotherhood, or something similar would be better - Grobbulus sounds more like a PvP or Normal to me.
---
They're going to play on Golemagg?  
---
My guild just decided to play on Golemagg.
---
 Thanks, appreciate you taking the time to answer. Managed to type up every macro I wanted though so I'm all set.
---
 I likely I wrote my macros in an unnecessarily long-winded made though. Could probably have made them shorter and neater. Since they work I will just use them anyways.
---
 For example for mouseover spells I ended up using macros such as these:
---
 #showtooltip
---
/startattack
---
/target [@mouseover, harm,nodead, exists]
---
/cast Shadow Bolt
---
/script UIErrorsFrame:Hide();
---
 I'm guessing /cast Shadow Bolt doesn't need to be on its own row. Stuff like that.
---
sonidigital, ziqo, venruki confirmed RP-PVP https://imgur.com/VvTKqpu
---
yeah but this creates another issue aswell, say that it wont drop of. What will they do "force" guilds away on another server or stay on a layering. Without actually giving people a choice  ?
---
Thanks!
---
Because it isn't right.  Scholo and Strath were both 10 man.
---
My guess is Herod
---
What? I doubt even more than 10% of players bothered to join the stress test. I certainly didn't.
---
Let's see how this launch goes...
---
Sulfuron, hehe, [I called it right here a week ago :)](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ckp7o8/anyone_want_to_take_guesses_at_the_server_names/evpwmu3/)
---
Too bad it's French only. Guess I'm going with Golemagg and an Alliance alt on Zandalar Tribe.
---
I have no interest in watching gaming streams and the entire concept baffles me so I may not be the best person to weigh in on this but... I would expect they will keep playing as long as people keep watching rather than when they personally get bored. I imagine hype and word of mouth about classic will last for a few months at least resulting in new people searching for it and ending up watching these streams to get a taste for the game.
---
France gets 1 PvP realm. 66 million population. Rest of Europe (minus Russia/Germany) is like 300 million+. Gets 2 PvP realms (3 if we count the RP-PvP). And Scandinavia will probably have as many players as France alone.
---
I mean it's just absurd. Every person from Greece to Finland to Portugal is gonna have to cram into these two realms.
---
Holy shit, never noticed it. My bad.
---
How about just let people do what they want?
---
overall the ammount of servers for both EU and US seems well low 25 servers for the west means they expect somewhere around half a milion to tops a milion after intitial wave of people taking a look at what classic was really like.
---
but that dose mean you can't really make a wrong choise inorder to try and grab your name.
---
Chill bro you got to level 6....
---
Yeah but 90% of the retail servers are dead
---
How many people do you expect will play? This is assuming 300k people want to play on a pvp server in the US, that is not that outrageous to expect.
---
Thanks
---
Some guy in the guild discord did some napkin math and estimated 25k pop on each pvp realm at start of p2, IF 90% of people quit by then. 
---
Judging by the numbers yesterday 25k could be a very low guess.
---
25k pop with no sharding lol
---
We don't give a damn where the actual data centers are. We care about server time for the purpose of raiding. Designate an Eastern as Central or a Pacific as Mountain.
---
Yes you are salty.
---
I think that , after a few weeks maybe after they hit 60, most streamers will end up playing most of their time off-stream because vanilla isn't really audience appealing.
---
I had a smooth 3 hour run to level 12 with my duo partner yesterday. Minor bugs but I am expecting things to be fine and for us to hit 60 no issue by day 8.
---
Why would you wait in line for that? Why wouldn't you just skip that quest?
---
Im upset out east we got probably pvp servers filled with streamers...and only a normy rp server.
---
They will add more realms, they'll have to!
---
He‚Äôs a fucking OG
---
sonitidital, venruki and ziqo will be playing on the RP-PVP server Grobulus on NA https://imgur.com/VvTKqpu
---
Yes, the eastern data center is in Chicago, so ping will be a little worse, but not awful by any means with modern infrastructure.
---
Are EST servers hosted in Chicago and PST in LA?
---
They will just add layers you will be fine
---
Epic.... just.... epic....
---
Are they fucking insane ? only 2 english normal realms ? and they picked the dumbest names ever for them too.
---
There goes my wish to get my main name I had on my original server and associate myself with since vanilla... no way ill be able to get it first with so many people on the same server.

---
I dunno, I find the names for the EU realms to be a bit shit tbh.
---
cya
---
 Make sure you streamers announce your servers. We as a populous don‚Äôt have the luxury of playing games for money and like to enjoy the time we play games. It‚Äôs very selfish for streamers, the people playing games publicly by choice, to not want to announce their server because of ‚Äútheir experience‚Äù. Why subject thousands and thousands of people to a poorer experience because of this? People that don‚Äôt have this same luxury, people that don‚Äôt want twitch chat in their face 24/7. These streamers choose to stream their games, they will be found out regardless. Save everyone who doesn‚Äôt want this trouble and give them the opportunity to avoid the chaos.
---
We‚Äôre talking time zones, not server location
---
Youll still meet people in the world. Theyre not gonna keep so many layers up that you dont see anyone. I dont think it will affect the community aspect at all, theres plenty of people wanting to play Classic
---
there is never enough warriors... it really wont(shouldn't be) be a problem
---
French too, I would say 90% +
---
Currently gambling that streamers go whitemane, herod, or have a locked server reserved for them to get their names (see leaked twitter image).
---
Fairbanks seems like the correct choice to me.
---
I couldnt care less about layering. Everyone argues it will ruin the economy and hinder social aspects, but the economy is going to be stagnant unless they are doing classic to "reboot" the series.
---
I dunno like. 
---
Pagle
---
Herod 
---
Whitemane 
---
Bloodsail Bucaneers
---
Arugal. 
---
All cool names imho. But ye each to their own. I know fundamentally it doesn't matter, I'm just being picky.
---
Herod is open tho
---
Logic.
---
The bigger question to be asking is "how long until phase 2?"
---
The only thing the devs said regarding phase length was that they would be "monitoring things."  They can just  open up more servers and/or extend Phase 1 longer if populations still haven't settled.
---
Also, don't assume that 10,000 players will be on at the same time once phase 2 drops.   At launch, sure.  but that's what layering is for.  After the few months Phase 1 lasts, everyone will have gone back to their normal lives and logins will be relatively stable outside of peak hours after work/school.
---
&gt;  What I‚Äôm saying is that the concensus is mild irritation, not rage.

---
I will try this challenge but exclude the death and iron men rules. I think that the challenges stipulation of using only what you're given in the spell book is a fun and interesting thing already.
---
I assume talents are the same way? You may only talent point in your own specialization tree?
---
Jesus Christ this is the Wildstar launch all over again. EU players are 70% PvP unlike NA which is 50/50. This is going to be a disaster.
---
i would love to use this to a stream scene ? can we ? thx for the nice work
---
New looks best
---
Morons and they the complain that blizzard scammed them
---
Whether you care about to or not, they said it won‚Äôt be kept in the game long term, so I‚Äôm not considering it as an extended solution.

Bloodsail Buccaneers here I come!

***Lok'tar Ogar!***
---
I logged in at 4pm friday with all 3 servers full and was in a 16min queue. Once I was in I was in. Even after trying to set graphics settings to windowed mode, itd crash every time but I could instantly log back in. 
---
The game feels enhanced. Like private servers had that old 2004 VGA/composite filter look about it. This looks like when you experience ps2/gamecube on component for the very first time. Not a bad thing but a surprise to see none the less.
---
they stole them from the pandaren
---
&gt; Whitemane: Horde favored 2nd highest pop pacific.
---
Human Character in-game, OP believes Horde server
---
&gt; Fairbanks: Alliance favored pacific.
---
Undead Character in-game, OP believes Alliance server
---
and the stress tests are for REALLY hyped people.  i'm at like a 9.8/10 on hype and i still didnt bother to pay just to get into the stress test, so there must be a LOT more people...
---
Ass hole move would be that the streamer settles on a RP realm.
---
Paladin 5 minute buff Inc!
---
Yeah im also realy excited :D Since Vanilla only Played Warrior.. now i will try my best as Druid Tank :)
---
I played on the oceanic serve whil the NA ones were locked and had about 300ish ms.  Besides some loot lag, everything actually felt very stable and comfortable to play.  150ms would still be noticeable but still very playable.
---
A zone with uncontested mobs offering good loot and decent xp *and* potential for a 10-man leveling party? No idea why people would run that at a fairly low level.
---
Ha.  Yeah, thats a pretty safe bet.
---
This is the problem, and it sucks
---
My names WILL be taken if I don't do it right away, so it's basically a gamble

---
[https://willitclassic.com/](https://willitclassic.com/)
---
... that is literally what im saying
---
Warlock is usually hard to find
---
They can but with layering enabled . Ideally they want new server tech to handle a non layered traditional server population which it wasn‚Äôt even designed to do. It‚Äôs complicated and you‚Äôd think we could have 10k people in one area by now but nope
---
Are people on RP servers friendlier than general PVP servers? I‚Äôve never played on one, I might just choose this server
---
Hopefully they‚Äôll reevaluate the server situation once they have an idea of what population each server has.
---
It looks even worse ingame, like 20 fps.  This was nice looking spell effect and was changed in WoD for something way worse. And now even in classic we cant get it back. Sad.
---
The amount of realms doesn't really change anything. Ranking is based on % of playerbase, so with more players there is more spots.
---
"I don't care so noone cares." Jesus fucking Christ shut the fuck up.
---
Who are the APES?
---
ok
---
Yeah, I kind of doubt the streamers are going to publicize their server choice until launch. Even doing so after they‚Äôve reserved their names would be a bad idea on their end.
---
MIne was in German too. Had to adjust the language settings in the launcher and it fixed.
---
And?  The other option is a Horde meme.  There are only two PVE EST servers.
---
Druid is usually the lowest
---
Two english PvP realms. Have you loat touch with reality Blizzard? Or do you just want classic to fail?
---
Or, is this an oportunity for us to relive the launch chaos from 15 years ago?
---
Try setting compatibility mode to Windows 7 for classic, that fixed the windowed mode crash for me.
---
i think people are being harsh.  they seem to be named for nostalgia vanilla things and i kinda like that.  its really a total non-issue compared to the NUMBER of servers
---
Did you get the party frames to work? Only thing that is bugging for me with it currently. And a pretty big one at it.
---
Haha my first thought was to coordinate with people I know to play there then I immediately thought it would draw the streamers‚Äô eyes as well.
---
I'd imagine name reservation will give them at least some sense of the opening populations.
---
&gt;Still I wouldn't paint the devil on the wall yet and see how things go with their initial plan. 
---
For sure, I'm just happy we are getting it, however, it goes, and really too many people playing 6 months from now would be a wonderful problem to have.
---
staysafe said that he will maybe stream the server decision
---
Me personally I doubt I would notice any difference since I basically just mess around in game. Hardcore pvp folks probably do notice a difference though.
---
Exactly. I didn't play either. Neither did any of my friends or family who are gonna play. And they are taking a week off of work to play, and even they didn't join the stress test.
---
I honestly think Blizzard just doesn't understand how many people are gonna play this.
---
Same problem as well. Let me know if you find a solution for party frames.
---
I really wonder if this is enough servers.
---
IMHO WoW isn't affected by ping as much as other games and/or genres.
---
I've always played WoW on 150ms or more (playing in NA from SA) and never had too many issues. Some classes might be affected more than others, but it's not a huge issue in my experience.
---
Arr if you hop on me ship I be showin' ya ya landlubbers.
---
Literally pernocuced it as thanos and thought of that purple guy.  
---
Not even sure how to add that L sound in there.  Thanos it is.
---
I had a good time healing random people on my shaman last night. strongly considering maining a healer for classic.
---
Yes. We know.
---
where is the download button on that page?
---
And higher chance for premades to queue against eachother and waste 30 min
---
of course some professional janny redditlord snipes both subreddits
---
doubt you'll ever give up the one you don't play on either
---
Master of Deception is the talent.
---
But NE's Shadowmeld gives rogues/druids the equivalent of an extra point in that talent as a passive.
---
GOTCHU
---
Self fulfilling prophecy and tulpa and all that. If enough people share this sentiment it will come true, regardless of the unfounded predictions that perpetuated it. Or whatever, idk I‚Äôm really stoned.
---
I'm not *that* confident, but hey, let's see. 
---
RemindMe! 5 months
---
hopefully they congregate to one
---
So few servers but I'm not complaining.
---
It‚Äôs just the obnoxious crowd they tend to bring and how much their presence impacts a server. 
---
 If they decide to quit Classic down the road, their fan base will most likely follow which creates an imbalance on all aspects (playerbase, faction balance, economy, etc.)
---
One is Pacific the other is eastern. The decision should be made for you by that already.
---
It's negligible, really; a yard or so at most.  Stealth was so finicky in vanilla that the extra stealth level really never meant much.
---

I kind of agree with gotchasqr. I played Nostalrius at launch and there was this German guy I quested with in Dun Morogh as a Canadian myself and I ran into him in the world many times in later levels. In Classic we could meet in the early levels and then not see each other again for a while if we end up on different layers. That's not to say I don't understand the reasons for layering.
---
This time around I will bet Pally/ Warrior. This is because they are the hardest to level and we have been conditioned to be little bitches.
---
Druid tanks are GREAT for off tanking/tanking mobs they have great sustain!
---
Does Blizzard expect the NA population of Classic to boil down to \~35k by phase 2? How else will layering be removed?
---
Wasn't Overwatch first Project Titan: a failed MMO?

I‚Äôm a PvP player....thus the pve server I wouldn‚Äôt be playing on. That means my server name wouldn‚Äôt be what I‚Äôve previously identified as my preference. Thus, from my perspective this is not an ideal outcome. 
---
It‚Äôs not rocket science mate.
---
Shadowmeld has a passive that makes druids and rogues stealth slightly better.
---
Fortunately, for all of us, this kind of situation will be very rare outside of the first week or so of the game.
---
I will also have a very limited time to play the game (less than you from the sounds of it) and if I run into this kind of a situation I will likely go somewhere else to level or start a second character in a different starting zone.
---
Best of luck!
---
Wheres the Chicago sever?
---
Ion said they were aiming for a server pop of 3k, which has to mean concurrent not total.  Its not that they lack the tech to have bigger servers, they are choosing small on purpose because thats how Vanilla was.
---
I feel like this video is applicable to any decision Blizzard makes regarding Classic
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJy6bJ\_RxXg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJy6bJ_RxXg)
---
Yup. They‚Äôll be found instantly on launch. It‚Äôs selfish of the not to announce it because fanboys will flock to their server anyways. It would only help the community if they told us early.
---
Or Blizzard has better numbers and just this sub is overblowing how many people will actually play Classic.
---
In the private server scene, it was what, maybe 3x10000 max? (3 big large vanilla servers) For US and EU together...
---
tfw grobbyboy
---
Might not be the place to ask, but I‚Äôm in Colorado on Mountain Time. I don‚Äôt particularly want to stay up late nights on weekdays on weekdays for raids, so I‚Äôm thinking of joking an Eastern Time zone.
---
Should I be concerned about lag or anything like that from an Eastern time zone, when I‚Äôm closer to Pacific? Sorry if this is a dumb question, just not sure how the servers work
---
My friend is the same as you and finally convinced him to play. You will absolutely adore this game if you liked osrs. I originally came from that game to wow in 06.
---
And I feel sorry for you for being so closed-minded thinking that only your way of enjoying the game is acceptable.
---
All eastern server are located in Chicago which is CST....
---
Armour kits are very poor for Druids as they are not affected by the Bear Form multiplier. Take herbalism instead. Being able to gather herbs in Cat and Travel form is fantastic. Lots of early herbs like Briarthorn, Swiftthistle, Grave Moss, and Goldthorn start off worthless but quickly rise in price when people start hitting level 60 and raiding. You will bank lots of money by keeping the right herbs around.
---
Just did /r/WhitemaneClassic
---
In Oce we have 1 PVP and 1 PVE server. Things are going to be interesting for us
---
It's complicated, i am German and some of my friends want to play on a German realm so we have to decide as a group which realm we take
---
I was expecting a few more servers and a central one thrown into the mix.  First couple months will be rough.  Here we come playing at night!
---
100% rolling on Whitemane
---
Well of course not. A big amount of returning players don't feel it's worth resubbing yet only to try a bit on the stress test and reserve a name.
---
Ah come on man, don‚Äôt be like that. I‚Äôm just keen to grow the community, I‚Äôm literally looking for mods to help get things running.
---
just FYI: none of these early quests are necessary or worth waiting for.  
---
Nothing wrong with waiting around, especially if it's a neat experience like this, but you're probably better off just killing some boars and skipping loot quests like this.
---
One won‚Äôt have any rp and is half of the available pvp realms for west coast... choose wisely. I know Whitemane will be hardcore non rp
---
Well some players will have inside info, then word will spread. I think you're right that they will leak it. I know 1 or 2 streamers in particular that most of the people I've talked to want to avoid.
---
I think they have few servers because they expect the player drop off to be that severe. They may open new ones eventually, though.
---
The karma whoring is getting worse. This just got crossposted to the same subreddit it came from ü§Ø
---
Thanks guys. Looks like I'll be rolling Alliance on Europe then.
---
Damn yo, no Central servers...
---
Sucks to be me living in East with half my friends East and the other half West...
---
Will have to devise a plan to get all my friends to unknowingly join my East server lol.
---
Grob is pacific and big time difference
---
I was thinking this as well. I plan to target this server first for my names. If I get the three I want, then I stay.
---
My logic is the exact same as yours. Hello brain twin.
---
I am.   I wann play on both!
---
Apparently Grobbulus is a creepy flesh monster in Naxx.
---
I think whoever named the servers is having a bit of fun at the expense of the RP-PvP people.
---
I think you've got it backwards mate
---
Blood and Thunder!
---
You got 3 names, 5 PvP servers. Just gamble 3 of the 5 and choose which to main after streamers commit.
---
Who's everyone? Two people? 
---
I don't have to prove common tips and strategies for leveling a Warrior with anyone. It's a 15 year old game and it's well known how rage works and how warriors can take advantage of that to increase their DMG output.

Do you know if there is or will be a discord server for the Zandalar Tribe? I previously joined the WOW RP server but it was changed to Hydraxian Waterlords today and since they where so BM and rude to us who prefered RP PvP I left it. I'm hoping to find more like minded people to play with that wants both RP and world PvP
---
hahahahahahahaha xaxaxaxaxaxaxaxaxaxaxa hahahahahahahaaha xaxaxaxaxaxaxaxa
---
I sure hope so, curious which Pacific PVP server will come out ahead population wise.
---
That‚Äôs 21.6 million dollars a year. Not bad.
---
Well isn't it just one of the two RP servers to choose right?
---
I kid I kid!
---
btw. :)
---
&gt; faerlina
---
Surprised this one isn't getting more hype. It's the nicest looking/sounding one imo.
---
Agree, bet there are 2 more servers they can opt to use.
---
I have several accounts and have called out of work. I will be reserving thex on every server.
---
Is this some sort of meta-meme that I'm unaware of, or do you not know who APES are
---
Give it about 24 hours, i think the community will come together and determine where the CST unofficial server will be.
---
Honestly if it wasn't around the corner, 8 would have unsubbed a while ago.
---
Thal (rhyming with Pal) - nos.
---
Hmm, my concern is going to be with the economy and faction balance. Once things have settled a bit and the layering is done. High level resource nodes or mobs needed for mats are going to be a nightmare. Given there is only 2 pvp realms, I could see both skewing horse. We'll see.
---
Might need a repost to get people to update info for this site :)
---
No central is a bummer. Some in game friends I play with are all eastern time. Me and 2 others are pacific. Wanted to meet in the middle . Sounds like eastern time for me
---
Honestly glad you commented to confirm because I expect people to argue the opposite. Its important now that some of ya'll actually do voice this concern with the rest of us. Appreciated.
---
Isn't this what the community was wanting though?  having a larger pool than the base 3K vanilla had?  Something like 10-15K server pops?  and layering is just helping to not have to do dynamic respawns and what not in the game that pservers did to manage that influx in starting zones.
---
I agree, giving France a PvP realm is the greatest waste they came up with since.. ever? :)
---
Yeah I was playing and then I got to level 8 and it all just hit me like, do I really want to do this *twice* in three weeks. Knowing your character is going to be deleted in 24 hours really short circuits how WoW functions as a game.
---
Good luck trying to convince someone on the Internet that water is wet tho
---
It feels good. I can‚Äôt wait for all the goods times to be had with the boys of Grob.
---
What happened to #nochanges?
---
They can easily hold more than 3k players without layers. On private servers 6k population felt great, Nost peaked at around 12k concurrent players which felt a bit crowded. I think between 6-9k concurrent players is a nice balance without layers.
---
Pretty self explanatory
---
I don't follow the streamer scene but I do know about the big streamers in the US. For EU however are there any big popular streamers? Enough to make their presence felt if you happen to roll on their server I mean?
---
Why didn't you guys just q up in the dungeon finder and get teleported there?  Obviously that's much more fun, classic is just nostalgia.
---
Sorry but I checked and there are no sources stating that.
---
As you can see from the research I‚Äôve been far from lazy about this.
---
I like how people are so aggressively "no changes!" but when you present something like this they just go "eh, who cares". Even if it would remain unused by vast majority of players, it should be in game if it was at the time.
---
Calling it now, they released so little servers to the pops stay super high and justify the fact that they will not remove layering later.
---
Frexit!!
---
Herod bangs. It will be the most populated US EST PvP server. Bet it will be the streamer server.
---
MOMMY WHITEMANE BEST SERVER
---
Phase 6 is naxx patch
---
cringe
---
They were actually fixed and working as intended. Enjoy!
---
How is it horrible advice?
---
More hits = more rage = more skills = you kill two mobs faster than they kill you.
---
It's really simple and you can hope on a Warrior of any level in Classic and do it as any spec.
---
This is a bad troll attempt. Go look at the top Warrior content creators out there and their guides and tips, this is one of them. 
---
Period.

So much for finding quiet low-pop realm
---
Or maybe it's not that much of a gamble and they have gathered enough data in the last months in order to get at least a solid ballpark going and it's just not as exciting as we had hoped it would be.
---
How will layering kill the economy?
---
Lok‚Äôtar!
---
I think I exclusively did them as 10 until they changed it to 5.
---
!remindme 7hrs
---
Yep, I've played two hunters on pservers to midt 40s.. probably the most fun I've had playing wow in many years. Hunters are great! 
---
Druid was my very first character, but i switched to warrior around 30 and then switched to rogue around 20 then stuck with that untill 70 or so.. 
---
Hopefully I'll stick with one this time. But i higly reccommend hunter because they are so much fun to play. content is easy and soloable and you dominate most classes in wpvp while leveling (at least in BM)
---
if you know their character names why not just log on to the server you wan and make their name for yourself prevents them from wanting that server.
---
got the right version and it works now! thanks
---
Not a fan of the name either but fine with pst so its where i will lay my head.
---
Did you disable the addons?

streamers will create the most populated pve and pvp servers, most people will flock there regardless because of that. Honestly, its a good thing because it makes the streamers traffic a moot point.
---
Herod is a cooler name. It bangs. It exudes Chad energy.
---
Atiesh represent!
---
100% playing on Mankrik
---
I like how the French and German servers are pretty equal while the English and Russians have fucked their server balance.
---
2? More like 1 after Spaniards and other non-german or french overtake one of them.
---
Blizzard are killing themselves. This is retardeed.
---
I agree the server names don't sound too attractive...Pagle???? Oof.
---
Good, keep the spazzes out East!
---
Full of chads and trolls
---
Hell yea! Hype level are getting real. But an honest question. Doesnt this seem like a very small amount of servers? I feel like their is going to be a Huge rush of players and 5 pvp and 4 pve seems like not enough.
---
Because this isn't how layering works.
---
If you are pro you kill the bandits outside
---
It‚Äôs one of the main reasons I‚Äôm my group of friends is considering RPPVP. We‚Äôre from Emerald Dream too so we‚Äôre away almost nobody RPs on the servers anyway. Problem is getting people who haven‚Äôt played these servers to be on board. ‚ÄúRP? The fuck?‚Äù
---
My guild and I will be heading to Herod
---
Aaaand now we wait for the classic connections threads to fill up
---
I like them way more. Everlook sounds like my future home.
---
Why couldn't they also release the data center location for each server. I wanted to pick a server with low latency. And no, PST/EST does not imply the server is physically located in those regions.
---
r/PyrewoodVillage
---
Asmongold has already been reserved by Blizz on all realms.
---
wow holy crap, only 11 america servers? I guess we really won't have to worry about any server dying. Herod or Whitemane are likely my biggest contenders (and I assume most people will go Herod haha).
---
So are you personally going to run 10 man low level dungeons? If not, why post so fiercely for something so minor? Does this thread really need hundreds of comments?
---
2pm PST I believe the bluepost said.

Alternatively, you could just enjoy weed like a normal person without trying so hard

---
Shhh if we keep saying its a nicer community the trolls will make it a thing to ruin the server.
---
What I said: there‚Äôs no way it lasts two weeks, it will be like 2-4 months
---
I‚Äôm agreeing with you more than I‚Äôm not. I just don‚Äôt think it will be *Ultra-perma-layering for everyone!!!*
---
The chance of no streamers leaking the server they're playing on is pretty low.  Most of those dudes are total buffoons.
---
&gt; PS/2 connector
---
I actually don't know of a consumer motherboard without a PS/2 connector.
---
They will deny it afterwards too and make up excuses or readily eat up Blizzard's nonsensical excuses. Bunch of c.... if you ask me.
---
Warlock its a good choice if not you can go mage both have very good solo power and they are good for groups too
---
EU ?
---
How did that go?
---
Do you think that is a high risk probability? I mean, we aren‚Äôt by any means going to be pushing for server first in anything, just looking for better organization.
---
In my first Deadmines run, I didn't understand how or where the patrols kept coming from behind us. At one point a patrol happened shortly after I saw a rat and I honestly thought the rats were linked to the patrols. I killed everything rat for the rest of the dungeon.
---
Why the hate?
---
One trusted person makes an alt who is the guild bank. Everyone sends it gold to max the bank slots. Maybe you make two guild banks when the first one fills but one guild member controls those Alts and is responsible for maintaining the stock and inventory of the bank. There are addons that spit out all the inventory and bank inventory of your characterbinto a spreadsheet . Make a google sheet and have the guild bank person update it every 3 days or so. 
---
Lots of responsibility and trust for being guild bank, if that person walks off with all the gold and items you can‚Äôt do anything to reclaim it as there‚Äôs no rule preventing bank theft because its player driven.
---
Prioritize sending the guild bank mats for pots ; pre raid boes crafted items or the mats  for those crafted items. Progression mats like dark iron scraps , fire resistance boes, good patterns or recipes for future 60s in guild or to sell... its best to keep it limited in types of items and try to spread around more niche items to be banked by individual members. But having it in one place makes it easier for transparency for the entire guild . Good luck . Choose the right person, guild master usually may not have time but if it‚Äôs a council leading a guild it may be easier to assign responsibilities like one guy is overall decision making leader and promoter, one person focused on recruitment delegation to class leaders, one is managing dkp or epgp, and one leading bank.
---
Is that on your fanny pack?
---
Yeah man no big deal just give Blizz another $15 a month! LOL
---
It wasn't customer service, considering they had game designer internships there a year ago when I was considering it.

---
I was debating whether or not to roll on the RP-PvP server. With the queues (and all the streamers) on the two PvP servers, guess the RP-PvP realm seems like the best choice after all...
---
Even if they go like 10k population cap(VERY high) on those realms in phase 2, its not gonna be enough lol. 20k spots for EU PvP players (which are the majority of the players) is a major fucking xd from blizz.
---
SO Happy with them so far but this is a major worry for me.
---
Oh, absolutely. The impact of Asmon is differen than the impact of Shroud, regardless of size. But yeah, it's gonna be fun to watch - and hopefully play.
---
I can't tell / know the difference TBH
---
We need a new version of that pinned subreddit so people can pick their faction and potential server.
---
No time is wasted making it as close to vanilla as possible
---
Horde PvE here, headed for Mankrik('s wife)!
---
Except you're leaving out the fact that it isn't just Deadmines that allowed more than 5 players.
---
OP says it clearly and more specifically than you do here.  It's not just about Deadmines unlike your post.
---
Forsure, but theyre generally based around realm time
---
Not a single of my 30 friends that are going to roll together was on the stress test. There are probably A LOT more people than they expect.
---
Playing the stress test last night /1 was full of "IS ASMON HERE??"
---
"Is asmonbald here?"
---
"asmongold is bald"
---
"HI YOUTUBE"
---
it was......tedious
---
And decent amount of french and germans also forgo their local options and go ENG realms so some there too. 
---
Its just not feasible.
---
I think Blizz really underestimates how many peopel are going to try classic, but I think they are right on the money on how many will stick around and actually play it.
---
I would think that 80% actually are people that started post wotlk or atleast post tbc.
---
I would be thrilled if after the first 2-3 week there would be 2 decent populated servers left. 
---
A great danger is is Blizz gives a nee-jerk spinup of more realms.
---
I see .  Never read or really watched any of those ! R/EntsOfWarcraft lol gotta get that made for you
---
5g and you know your healer and tank are playing together and not going to bail is worth it IMo.
---
awesome ü§£
---
It's almost as if they don't want to admit that A LOT OF PEOPLE really want to play classic. You think you do but you still do
---
Sure I will add people I had a good time with to my friend list. But I'm not going to add every guy that had a small impact on my experience. 
---
It'd be nice seeing that one warrior you saved from death some days ago run through Orgrimmar a few days later. You go and think "oh hey, I remember that guy!". Layering ruins these small interactions.
---
What?  I've never heard of abilities dropping in the world
---
ONCE AGAIN, THE STRESS TEST ISNT A GOOD INDICATOR OF A REAL LAUNCH FFS DUDE
---
EVERYBODY IN UGANDA KNOWS KUNG-FU.
---
GWA GWA GWA
---
You should create another one of these and include the just announced server names, faction, class, and race. That way people can try and gage their server choice :)
---
One other thing to keep in mind is that skinning and 40 points in LW helps you to make Kodo hide bags. If you are unlucky, you can easily make yourself a bunch of 6 slot bags and go from 15 (can‚Äôt get rid of HS) to 39 slots in a short period of time as well as supplying bags for your friends is cash
---
The general consensus I've always seen is the exact opposite; balance is typically considered the worst for raids. Resto is the most common spec you will see in raiding. Hybrids in general are normally "forced" into their healing specs (the content is easy enough to do as any spec though). You'll see feral off tanks around as well, more than you'll see balance. Still more common for a warrrior off tank though.
---
Responded, but it doesn't let me see results.
---
In Phase 2, which should just be a few months after launch, they're supposed to go from 30 or however many layers to 0 layers for one shared game world.
---
With so few servers, I feel like that's going to be nearly impossible unless they want 20k+ concurrent players. Either:
---
a) Blizzard is grossly underestimating how many players will try out Classic, and/or overestimating how many players will quickly quit the game,
---
b) Blizzard is planning on opening new servers and offering server transfers, which makes no sense because layering was designed to specifically avoid this, or
---
c) Blizzard wasn't telling the truth and they never expected to be able to abolish layering by Phase 2.
---
I'd like to think blizzard who has professional paid employees would have more knowledge/data on this compared to some random over dramatic Reddit user
---
Can we get a poll maybe for servers?  Wanna see what everyone will be leaning towards
---
When layering goes away, Blizzard knows exactly how many layers are currently active with players and they will make new realms to match the number of active layers. They know there's a LOT of people that will quit a few days/weeks/months in and that's why the decided to have the layering system to begin with.
---
They literally explained this in interviews and what not.
---
Other than starting off as a Druid and being absolutely god awful at it, I thought sap meant CC in general. So in dungeons I'd suggest that the mage "sap" patrols.
---
slobbulus on his knobbulus
---
Will we gain visibility to this?
---
I don't know I just assumed lol
---
It was closer to 60 for launch, and then they quickly added more.
---
According to this realm list, they expect 100k players. Not millions.
---
So, again, what is the point on name reserve?
---
It is dangerous. Yours is aswell to a lesser extent. It was the most popular method as far as I know though.
---
Forsen.
---
Unpopular opinion: streamers set up cool, big-player world events that are pretty fun. And I don't even watch them, but the few times I have seen stuff it just looked like everyone was having a good time.
---
it doesn't have to be the same scale at launch to cause a problem when you are putting the entirety of the US playerbase on 11 servers that is 110,000 people which I don't think is very many on a launch day of something as large as the PVP patch.
---
I said this during the stress test and I‚Äôll say it again. Not a chance layering is turned off in Phase 2. 
---
It started with just starting zones for a few weeks, it ended up with the whole of Azeroth for phase 1. With this realm announcement can anyone please explain how they will be able to turn it off after phase 1?
---
So I have a 1/3 chance of my classic experience being ruined awesome.
---
MOVIE MOVIE MOVIE
---
The audience for the stress test is more narrow, so many thex jokes. 
---
Remember, we are not real life.
---
Yeah I don't really understand what he was getting at, I agree with you. Sure, if we find out we are rolling on the streamer server then we can swap, but then our names could possibly be taken that we reserved. Although not a big deal, it is kinda annoying.
---
realm transfer, bro
---
Fucking hell, so there's a 50/50 chance that you're going to be on the  server with a 10,000 queue full of streamers. Awesome.
---
This has really killed my buzz..
---
Those sly bastards! It would be a good PR move.
---
Well la de da then. Must be nice.
---
im saving my name on all my timezone servers to start.  
---
i'll figure out the rest few days after.
---
This is the NA server list. There is a separate list for EU.
---
I play on a live PST server from NY and the difference is definitely noticeable, around 80 ms compared to 35 ms for EST servers. Absolutely gonna roll EST for Classic.
---
Nope. Requires blacksmithing 225 to equip.
---
Rp-PvP for Europe?
---
So on the left (vanilla) it has a crackly "lightning" look, while on the right (classic) it has a rounder "wave" look?
---
As a Troll Warrior I take offense mon'.
---
Mirage Raceway sounds like a map from Mario Kart
---
Depends entirely on the how open streamers will be prior to launch. If they are smart, they won‚Äôt say shit.
---
That's true, kind of makes me worry that they might be testing the waters for not dropping layering at all.
---
The game itself and the fanbase? They straight up admitted themselves its "antithetic" to classic WoW (Ions words).
---
That imp's name xD "Chokin"
---
i lol'd
---
I'm playing on the RP-PVP realm.
---
I think I'm safe.
---
Then when you explain they misread or misinterpreted they tend to double down or change the argument.
---
PSA: Spaniards are gravitating towards Golemagg and will have a meeting on Sunday to make their decision. So if you don't want to be stuck on a Spanish server, watch out for that.
---
No I never have? I honestly never looked into WoW till late BFA. Whats so bad about WoD?
---
don't like it when players think they are too good to play with those outside their comfort zone
---
I was not aware enough during vanilla to know how risky it was and I have not kept up with retail so much that I know how blizz looks at account sharing nowadays.
---
It is a good name.
---
Will his name be Chad?
---
&gt; In the private server scene, it was what, maybe 3x10000 max?
---
Way more considering every vanilla ps. And then they are just ps players, you should add retail who wants to play classic aswell.
---
I don't see people asking for 100 realms, but pretending 2 PvP realms are enough for EU is deluding yourself.
---
Yeah, all a bunch of bad options really.
---
https://www.avoidstreamers.com/
---
Already have one lol
---
But it's not gonna be of any use to people who want to reserve names or start right away. We won't know for a couple days in probably
---
Where are you getting your million players figure?
---
I played from vanilla through cata on a wc server, never noticed a problem.
---
I dont know anything about WoW, Classic will be my first time with this game. But 2 servers just dont seem enough to me. It isnt just europeans on those servers. Its literally Europe+Middle east+North Africa. Probably wont sub if its going to be a queue sim.
---
That‚Äôs because people logged in for Addons and then logged out genius.
---
Let‚Äôs see, 10 streamers not getting the name they want vs *hundreds to thousands* of people being screwed by choosing the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù server by happenstance. They‚Äôre being selfish by not announcing it beforehand, plain and simple.
---
LA or Chicago. That is where Blizzard's data centers are.
---
Same here friend!!! Can‚Äôt wait!
---
Sounds like you are describing American cities in general. Also pretty funny to think New York, DC, Philly are somehow cleaner than even LA.
---
Please Blizzard give us a couple more english servers and change the names to something you would actually want to join.
---
Well if you end up rolling Horde on the APES server, you will wish you had informed yourself about the APES.
---
I'm hoping they all go to one servers. Soda will balance the Horde, and Asmon will balance the Alliance.
---
How many players were on in the last 24hrs for the stress test?
---
Agreed. But also, please do.
---
Thal-nos. Not exactly mind bending shit lol.
---
Bold move saying 100% when you can‚Äôt verify what you‚Äôre saying.
---
RPPvP server named after an undead flesh giant? Yikes.
---
OP, please ignore this redditor. 
---
Don't be afraid to ask for help. It's worth it.
---
They get good server names while the U.S. gets the "fuck you for making us do this" names.
---
For sure. Well the first 1 wouldn‚Äôt, but that‚Äôs just about limiting the amount of data stored, not how to handle it better.
---
I also didn‚Äôt say this is something they should really prioritize. But it‚Äôs definitely cool to see a bunch of skeletons laying around the first rag kill on a server haha
---
Seriously you guys got the good name for a RP-PvP server. 
---
Wth.
---
Grob means coffin in Russian so that works alright.
---
This is absurd, I pictured 20+ servers for the english community. With so much layering they have to put in its just gonna feel like retail again.
---
Me too, as a Pacific player. I'm guessing Whitemane for Pacific will have more players than Fairbanks. Just sounds cooler.
---
Yeah okay weirdo
---
there are EST servers in LA?????
---
Yesterday you said there were 1 million players in the stress test. Where are you getting these numbers from?
---
That's such a terrible argument. You obviously want to get it right the first time. Would you be fine with them releasing one server? I mean if they can just make more?
---
We're talking about launch here. I'm sure pretty much everyone understands that in a years time they'll have added a bunch more servers probably, but we all want to have a good time in the first few days, weeks and months too.
---
imagine unironically playing on a realm literally called gnomelag.
---
....that's just crazy. People care about Reddit points so much, for what? You do know we can see the OPs name right?
---
True. A risk you run if you specify certain people to handle one or two specific types of mats too
---
I'm collecting them rn. Dm me your discords
---
Fair point, hope you have a good time in Classic!
---
Wasn't finished with it yet - you all are too quick! Should be view-able.
---
layering
---
If you seek to recreate vanilla as it was it indeed is entirely wrong. Not sure why you are breaking of a crusade here to implement this CHANGE to the game that does not hurt you and enables other players to play in bigger groups.
---
I‚Äôm still kinda lost . No offense taken here lol. I think you did fine though
---
Yeah I *really* hope those locked ones are for the streamers
---
Yeah thats pretty cool, but definitely something that doesn't belong anywhere near classic ;)
---
Asmon‚Äôs guild got maxed out (1000 players) within the first 10 minutes of it being made on this latest stress test. 
---
He will be untouchable
---
I mean not to sound rude but yes that goes without saying. My point still stands tho.
---
They're being selfish? Seriously? They don't owe you anything the same as you don't owe them anything. If you don't want to play on the server they're on then it's your problem to deal with, not theirs. Your enjoyment of the game being so closely tied to them that you're "screwed" if you happen to be on their server is 100% a "you" issue. Why should they cater to you?
---
Both Asmon and Soda are in Austin?
---
Where'd ya hear that? Not saying you're wrong or anything! Twitch clip?
---
Honestly, excusing my own level of hype, this list seems shorter than I was expecting.
---
And this basically identifies why Barrens chat was what it was, and not Elwynn, Teldrassil or Dun Morogh

It‚Äôs a cap that is obviously hard coded in. It should be trivial to change and it would make the game more authentic.

They get their own server because they can hardly understand English in parts of France.

If I could have gotten Akama, I would have. But then there would be the temptation to piss on it every day!
---
I would have expected more realms, guess I was way off
---
I feel like it's better to have servers be way too overcrowded for a few weeks(months) than it is to be a few months out and have a handful of absolute ghost towns. Having spent a lot of classic &amp; BC on a dead server, it is not fun.
---
Then you'll find a good home on an RP server for sure. I'm rolling on Grob myself!
---
lolwut
---
Vote so we have some sort of prediction on faction balance for these servers
---
Thank you. Where can people keep tabs on that?
---
Thinking rolling horde on grob and alliance on whitemane.
---
You are like the 7th person to have "started this line"
---
General chat will be filled with twitchtalk.
---
Much appreciated, thank you :D
---
Yes. 
---
Would be nice if someone post this gif on us forums, so they maybe fix it before launch.
---
You act like playing on a private server in Europe was a choice though. But I'm happy to be under 100ms either way.
---
Chances are if you saw a guy on your layer, he will still be on your layer later (unless he joined a guild, or grouped with someone on another layer).
---
Also, you've a better memory than I if you can remember every single person you come across.
---
Also am liking this nugrunning it's like premade clean weakauras very nice
---
Hum... I'm not very concerned with raiding, and I tend not to be on till later in the evening EST. I wonder if I'd be better served rolling on a PST server.

So if Blizzard offered you the ability to leave your realm, would you do it?
---
This is not about if the service is available, you spent time on your realm, you get a reputation on your realm, you're in a guild on a realm, you're this and you've become that, and sure some would gladly transfer, but its a consequence of underestimating the amount of players that want to play. I understand that we should not have a hundred servers, but 6 seems rather low.
---
Because you're using "not having played Vanilla" as a way to insult people and invalidate their opinions.
---
&gt; for free
---
&gt; Activision-Blizzard
---
Pick one.

I think Bloodsail Buccaneers not being on Oceanic is missed opportunity

  The following realms will be available:

That makes me think there will be more, and you can only reserve a name on the following they list

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/co5xjk/psa_for_europeans_spaniards_are_having_a_meeting/).
---
Hahaha literally my exact thoughts. I myself decided Whitemane for the same simple reason, though I will hold out for more info on streamer dispersement to be sure.
---
Just google ["10 man scholomance"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaRrW1bpSxw) or  [10 man stratholme](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/7lez47/an_argument_for_15_man_ubrs_and_10_man_everything/?st=jz4eqr37&amp;sh=3fb83de6) 
---
Or the fact I did both 10 man when they were current content.
---
luckily its not really a skill based game, skill plays a role but classic is more about time, effort, and Knowledge
---
Spaz? Is this middle school in the early 2000s?
---
Not for long mate....*loughs in brexit*
---
Yeah this sounds good. 
---
Most speedleveler guides don't include dungeons so if you make some friends you might be able to get some gear and XP from a few runs. The gear might speed up the rest of your leveling.
---
Why Whitemane and not Fairbanks ?
---
For anyone looking to see the results, after you fill it out hit REFRESH. Then you can click ‚ÄúSee Previous Results‚Äù.
---
I think the real risks would be an officer quitting and robbing you blind on they way out or a hacked account and blizzard doing nothing about it because you weren't supposed to share in the first place (even if the hack wasn't related).
---
Why no Latin America &amp; Brazil Server? Even just 1 for each....
---
Man Blizzard should hire people from this thread because everyone here seems to know ¬´basic fucking math¬ª better than Blizzard themselves.

---
They haven't decided yet, but they say Golemagg is easy to pronounce.
---
Do people still use FRAPS or whats the go-to?
---
I read somewhen they launch with the early loottables??
---
Like, items that were added with DM or BWL would not drop in MC in Phase 1. Not sure about t2 placeholders, tho..
---
Bfa is unplayable. I resubbed to wet my appetite but damn it just feels like a second job.
---
Scholo and strath were usually ten mans from what I remember, but you could probably bring more in.  I remember our guild raiding rcf after MC for shits and giggles.
---
I won't disagree. A pirate-themed name fits the RP-PvP spirit amazingly.
---
It's your home. I'm going to use NA as an example... if you could choose between Herod (PvP) or Grobbulus (RP-PvP) you'd probably make a beeline for Herod. The only reason people will play on Grobbulus is because of the RP-PvP aspect. In Vanilla you represented your server too. It kinda sucks to say "I'm Blenins from Mirage Raceway EU" because it sounds like a scuffed private server.
---
Grobbies never say die!
---
population bases spawning and  dynamic respawns are two different systems. One based on active NPC entities the other based on active PC entities
---
ignorance is bliss i guess ...
---
Victory!
---
ping
---
Along with Staysafe and Esfand
---
If they didn't want that to happen then what did the expect people do lol?
---
One of those not-so-fleshed-out features?
---
We did it boys. Good job.
---
Definitely a PvP Eastern server because Chicago's datacenter is closer, so Faerlina, Herod or Thalnos. If I had to guess, Thalnos.
---
You just made me realize that I will have to dodge the streamers AND my people. I hope they all go to the same server.
---
You said you never played any MMO before BFA. Don't hop in the circlejerk just because it's popular on this sub. They are both decidedly MMOs.
---
I think nvidia has their own that you can use. It‚Äôs part of their driver client. Iirc
---
I‚Äôm not too sold on pvp honestly though. I remember when I used to play a private pvp server I would have to do so many pointless corpse runs when I would just be trying to go to a dungeon. Literally 5-8 corpse runs that each take 5+ minutes each. Especially as a healer I won‚Äôt have much capability to fight back
---
Again I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs changed or not I‚Äôm not crusading against it at all.  I just think it‚Äôs inconsequential compared to other things.
---
Not safe -  [https://imgur.com/VvTKqpu](https://imgur.com/VvTKqpu)
---
Back during classic/BC I was on CST server located in Dallas, so it was certainly a thing.
---
https://discord.gg/vXVSqj - This discord is a horde focused one - it is a clone of the alliance version. Thus it will need someone to take over it representing the horde.
---
Actually true, even NA had some really bad ones despite having the SM boss-theme going. I wish we had something like that, nope just random names.
---
I'm not in mood for joking bro.
---
whoa there bessie
---
Oh hell yeah "Bloodsail Buccaneers"! sounds amazing! Can't wait to RP in Classic!
---
People are more concerned about the actual server time, not its location
---
You...do realize that multiple people can get Scarab Lord, right?  As long as you hit the gong within a certain time after the first person does, you still get it.
---
Any other guild can still work towards it.
---
What he's saying is the amount of notice you have doesn't actually matter in this case, because if you want to troll Asmon, you don't need 3 weeks notice. You can just instantly make a character.
---
there is only one rp-pvp server so i assume the timezone isnt that important 
---
all of the non carebear larpers will be there
---
I wonder how much this info will change once certain streamers reveal which server they‚Äôll be on
---
Maybe they don't think there will be enough players from there. 
---
I think the Spansih communtiy may be coordinating to make "El Golemagg" the unofficial Spanish server, though.
---
As long as they are undecided 2/3 of my friends and mine name reservations are going to try and block their names. It's the best way we can prevent them.
---
Depends on the role you want to fill. In general most classes in retail have had their skills reduced to only essentials. In addition you have skills based on your spec. Because of that, hybrid classes don't quite feel like hybrids while your playing them. In classic druids are hybrids. Meaning that an equally geared druid usually won't hold a torch to another class that is focused on one role. With that in mind you bring a lot of versatility and if you utilize all of your told you can be essential in whatever environment.
---
If you liked the "feel" of being a druid and a hybrid in retail. That is enhanced in classic. If you really enjoyed one aspect of being a druid (just healing, or just tanking) you can still do that in Classic, but you really won't be shining like you would in retail.
---
except everyone is gonna be on the pvp servers
---
never a shortage of people here trying to put others down
---
Hi classic wow community , ! 
---
Big question. 
---
What are the Pros and Cons of a Druid x Shaman duo leveling comp? 
---
My goal in vanilla is to attempt competitive PVE content . 
---
Thank you!! :)
---
No where dude, but wow held like 14 million players at one point. Is 1 that unreasonable? Hardly. No way they can accommodate us on this server count without layering massively messing with server communities.
---
One reason I am picking RP-PVP is just because blizzard do not mess with the RP servers with any kind of phasing/sharding/cross-realm and even though that will not exist in classic, in the future if they decide to keep layering they're likely to exclude RP servers from that
---
[https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B-x4qY6WoAAiwdt.jpg](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B-x4qY6WoAAiwdt.jpg)I got the racetrack lol
---
/r/BloodsailBuccaneers RP PvE
---
tryed Makros and addons
---
&gt;  Disgraceful behaviour by Blizzard this 
---
I think like many in this thread you're over-reacting. They are being conservative yes but its not like these realms are final. If they need more servers they can easily open new ones up.
---
Sad but so true, bad luck OP.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs understandable. Idk though Fairbanks just sounds so boring
---
Negative.  I am a meat popsicle.
---
RP? Pve ruleset with encouraged rp in game action (talking in character etc)
---
Then why not just bring/pay for a regent?
---
Yes, I can't help but think that was the original intent, but got transposed somewhere in the pipeline.
---
late evening?
---
anyway i‚Äôm not expecting this to be a popular take in the classic wow sub but people need to relax their expectations a bit. i love this game too but i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs gonna be as big as people think.

Female NE OP
---
Where's the central server??? Texas got fucked
---
Definitely doesn't work. Clique load but doesn't work in game. When I type /clique in game, it says the command doesn't exists.
---
Early on it was bugged so you could raid a dungeon and drop the group to complete the quest and rejoin before the 60 second timer to port you out. This was used in all of the dungeons to loot quest items and even kill bosses. It was the standard early on in vanilla.
---
Except that it's going to say TBD until the 27th. Why would they announce where they are going?
---
I was really hoping you would do an Alliance version.  Thanks, I love it!
---
Oh I know! I don't even care if I ever finish it :D I just wanna try it at it's most nightmareish!
---
Overreacting? Its straight up not feasible UNTIL they open up more realms of which they havent yet and need to be shown they HAVE too.
---
Stop being naive.
---
It's the first time I've seen it outsite of Cata+ and I've leveled on multiple toons on private servers haha
---
Could've should've been Shattrath
---
I‚Äôm not OP And don‚Äôt know the WoW API, I‚Äôm afraid :( Just a passing techie.
---
If the population does not drop they can just open up servers to compensate believe me plenty of people will rush to a fresh realm every time one opens.
---
I don't see any pee jugs/bottles/bucket
---
Excellent!
---
I think unless you want to play shaman, warrior, or rogue, alliance has better buffs when it comes to raiding. But I also like female night elf animations quite a bit so I'm biased here.
---
If you feel that strongly about it then wait until they announce before you pick your server. They don't have any obligation to cater to your "needs". All they're doing is playing a game.
---
private server players have never exceeded 500k, id like to think 250k even. 
---
also the 1 million players would give each server about 8-10k players which is what was reported back in vanilla
---
One is enough to be honest
---
 Can't really decide between Undead mage or Undead priest. I will play PVE and PVP casually only. I cant attent to guilds with scheduled raids and the only PVP i will do are battlegrounds and world PVP. I don't have as much time as I used to do 10 years ago so I need an easy and fun class thats good in both pvp/pve. I think Mage is great because of the free portals and food but holy priest seems fun too for healing everyone will basically like you. Help pls.
---
They very much did promise that there'd be no layering in p2. They said it won't work with world bosses.
---
I want to know what realms are screwed because streamers
---
You haven't bound key to an Action Bar? *Scrub /s*
---
I ain't wrong, baby. I wish I was.
---
I can't decide if it's enough servers or not - it's 25 servers total worldwide. We've seen private servers break 15k concurrent players, I'm sure Blizzard servers can handle more than that though right? So I guess it'll be OK? Just hope they are prepared to add servers early on if necessary.
---
You roll need on the gear for the role you play in the group. 
---
If you are the healer, you roll need on healer gear whether it is cloth or leather. The best healer gear is cloth, so don't think you only can roll on leather.
---
If you are not the healer in the group, etiquette says you must ask permission from the healer to roll on healer gear otherwise you will be labeled a ninja.
---
It's definitely a win to have them all on one server. But if they announced it ASAP, then people could reserve names on only one server if they chose to either follow, or avoid, the streamers.
---
Also it makes it easier to coordinate with other friends and/or guilds to know sooner rather than later.
---
Hi, /u/damnthesenames
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/co66uk/test_server_still_running/). 
---
I heard something about everyone having a "home layer" that they will generally stay on to try to prevent that exact problem
---
This is why this strategy is dumb and doesn't make sense.  When they announce, probably a lot of people that want to avoid streamers will just drop the server and the stream snipers will fill in those gaps anyways.  It's really screwing over a lot of people while not even getting the benefit they want.
---
well i mean you‚Äôll be subbing soon anyway. frankly i‚Äôll pay half a sub to reserve a name and play for a day lol. if i had less $ if would hesitate though.
---
You think me and my friends being EST playing there we‚Äôll be ok?
---
Ye let me just force myself to watch a couple bs wow videos hours after release just to NOT fuck myself on server selection.
---
coming to a realm near you (one of the two pvp servers you can choose from)
---
No one ever said they did
---
Blizzard can do something about it though
---
If soda were to stream he‚Äôd have minimum 100k
---
See you all on Zandalar Tribe !
---
&gt;Feral and Boomkin are fun for PvE and PvP they absolutely can contribute - but you'll always rely on guild to carry you. Feral can tank or DPS - but you'll never be optimal.
---
I wish people who haven't been in the vanilla scene for years would stop parroting this kind of rubbish.
---
Bear tanks are *the best* farm content tanks for Alliance on virtually every single boss fight. Warriors, even with a Thunderfury, cannot surpass the threat of a bear using MCP - and threat is the only thing that matters when you're steamrolling MC in 35 minutes. In addition, they are *the best* main tanks for a number of fights even during progression - such as Kel'thuzad, Patchwerk Hateful Strikes, Fankriss, and Razorgore. Amongst others I'm sure.
---
I'm using Minion from WoWInterface. It not perfect, but I prefer it by far. Problem is that neither Minion nor Twitch has all of them. I have to use them both.
---
We were all on Hakkar/Crushridge :-)
---
Cool story
---
Your new setup is amazing.
---
I could live in that room!
---
Haven't you got a shit thread to be making on /v/? Fucking frogposters.
---
Basically that and general chats being filled with streamer talk are why I want to avoid streamers. I know I can just leave but I generally like those kinds of channels.
---
Thanks a ton
---
Because its not feasible to have paying customers sit in longass queues or ahve overcrowded realms.
---
THose arent the only options either. Launch hasnt been yet so why not add more NOW so "dead realms" wont really be a thing? J ust add 1-2 more and its still super safe and more reasonable
---
That'll be 49.99 on the blizzard gear store lol.
---
Vanilla servers could host up to 3500 players.
---
Since the thread is about EU PVP servers, I thought you were talking about EU, but you might be talking 1 million globally?
---
Economy is fucked. Professions can never recover due to that.
---
The RNG loot system creates 'endless content'. Won't be changed.
---
They can add niche abilities back, sure, but that wouldn't really change anything.
---
You mean Vanilla vs Classic, right?
---
Probably since broadband is everywhere now it's a bit unnecessary.
---
Grobbulus gang rise up
---
Very different. Retail Druid is basically no different from a pure class. You choose your spec and you lose access to your main abilities. 
---
Classic Druid is a legitimate hybrid that is best at filling multiple roles.
---
I used to be more indifferent on the matter of streamers because I didn't think they impacted people unless you wanted it to.  But here is an example where that's not the case.  What a bunch of douches.
---
Translate:
---
&gt; Thank you for all your feedback that comes in such a short time after the announcement. : Sparkling_heart:
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; A small request in advance, before I get to the actual topic:
---
&gt; Please adhere to the forum guidelines during your discussions and treat each other in a friendly, objective and respectful way. It does not help anyone to approach or offend each other and only leads to unnecessary forum breaks.
---
&gt; But now to the actual topic:
---
&gt; I fully understand the disappointment of some, especially the roleplayers, and assure you that your contributions and opinions will be heard by me and that I will forward your feedback (as always) to the appropriate places.
---
&gt; As soon as WoW Classic is released on August 27th, the developers, the server teams, and also us from the community team will keep an eye on the population of the German Classic Realms. Even if I can not promise you anything at the moment and you also have to wait and see how WoW Classic develops in the next few weeks and months, I'm relatively sure that if you need more German-language classic realms, take appropriate steps will make sure WoW Classic becomes a great and epic experience for everyone.
---
&gt; And now I wish you a nice and relaxing weekend!
---
Blizz same thing. I play too much DotA lol
---
I got one as well, level cooking and spread the pirate/ninja love!
---
Probably less than 5% of the actual players went on Stress Realm...
---
How do I save it?
---
You can cry too.
---
Not until phase 3
---
I‚Äôm more concerned about the time difference for raiding
---
Wtf are you talking about.. Smh
---
Well with only 2 PvP servers to choose from, both of them will be unofficial Spanish servers. That plus every other language in the EU that isn't French or German. 
---
I can understand not making servers for every single European language, but they could've at least done Spanish, Portuguese and Italian like on retail. That plus maybe 2-3 more EN-PvP servers.
---
Haha very fair. I never see it mentioned, and I know I‚Äôm very much an outlier in my level of enthusiasm for it. It was kind of a furtive post to search for kinship. Definitely strange, felt the need to ask it though.
---
thank you. i also logged in and out to set up my addons and i am a geniuos.
---
300 fishing skill, let‚Äôs do this!
---
Did virtually the same thing but with a dagger and some bracers to a rogue. Their response of ‚ÄúAH thank you!! This helps so much!‚Äù Fulfilled my yearning to play the stress test. Feels like it used too again :).
---
So by my math saying top end a vanilla server had 5k players, they only have enough servers to hold 55k players in EU. 
---
now with layering they may be holding alot more at the start, but we have been told laying WILL be removed AT LATEST phase2. 
---
So either 100's of thousands will be shunted over to new servers in P2, or this game will be a flop at only 55k players eu, and 60k US.
---
I love that you used "for the rest of the expansion" in reference to the only point in time the game wasn't an expansion
---
Perfect if its dead then launch should be fine since no one will be playing but me.
---
No, but like 50% of the country lives in EST. Should the west coast datacenter have a Hawaii time zone server?
---
Grobbulus represent!
---
this would still ruin any sense of community on the server, one of the biggest things for a server is people all starting and leveling on the same server with the same people. 'teleporting' into the server as a level 60 with no economy, no community, etc. will be pretty awful and it'll be hard for it to catch up community/culture-wise to the other servers. it really needs to be available from the start.
---
bluntly honest/what a lot of people are thinking =/= toxic. its not like he insulted him or said some bigot shit...but yes, keep using "toxic" as a blanket word for anything that has even the slightest negative connotation .
---
let's be real, this is only 2 realms for eu
---
&gt;within minutes
---
Nearly an hour in.
---
In the EU we get crap names. In the US you get.... him. 
---
We win. :D
---
Being famous on the internet is just as big nowadays as being famous irl
---
pretty sure they moved after that city got flooded a couple years back
---
You are the false Grobbers! The Great Injector has bestowed the Alliance with his mantle! Eat my Gnomish shorts!
---
Diggin the Deus Ex you got in the mix
---
No he was saying that was a solution to the issue, not that they already got to. He's basically campaigning for Blizz to let them reserve early.
---
I am from NY and I have 80 ms to the RP-PVP server on the stress test which appears to be Pacific
---
‚ÄúGuess you could say that‚Äù
---
Eastern is like 1 hr ahead of central...
---
Forsen is quite the roleplayer
---
"Look at this server population. Perfectly balanced.. as all things should be."
---
If this is true, thank God I am PST lol
---
You guys care about the dumbest shit imaginable.
---
I get what you're saying, and I genuinely wonder myself if they truly know the sheer magnitude of hype around this game. I feel like they have to understand it on some level. I feel like their actions are almost an expression of this awareness: the lack of advertising suggests to me they are already expecting a preternaturally high volume of players. I suspect too that they have plans, post launch, to accomodate for an influx of even more players as time goes on. Or those servers are far more capable than we might think. Or Blizzard botched it and Classic is dead. Guess we'll have to wait and see.
---
There I am.
---
Well we know they will be playing PVP. So if you want to avoid them. Go RPPVP, RP Or PVE
---
Fear not, Alliance friends...
---
I mean, do fear, and not friends.
---
No, don't actually cast fear.
---
DAMMIT
---
FOR THE HORDE
---
I'd change the last line to /startattack [nocombat]
---
It makes it so if your backstab fails because of range or target turns, you wont autoattack the target and break stealth
---
Alliance for Grobbulus! I'll see you all out there!
---
With so few servers, I don't think it's as big of a deal if you're on the same server as them. In my mind the problem would be the huge influence they would have over a specific server. But with only 5 PvP servers, each server will have tens if not hundreds of thousands of people, so only a fraction will revolve around the streamers.
---
&gt;spell id's from the combat log
---
that is likely why I can't get details to show my spell breakdown. aha!
---
They are EU players and this is the NA server list?
---
Didnt get it
---
glad theyre rolling on one server, but honestly they should announce which one if they care  about the community.  The name reservation is really important to a lot of people and I would be really pissed if I were a player who wanted to avoid streamers altogether and wasted my naming slots on their playground.
---
What am i looking at?
---
You can't count Benelux as native french speakers. Then you might as well add all other EU countries to native french speakers. Belgium has about 4 million french speakers. So that would make it a total of 70million native French speakers.
---
We need a Thex npc
---
Same here, im part of a ~25 man group thats super hyped for classic and only 2 of them joined the stress test and that was only for a few minutes so they could sort their addons and ui.
---
Educated and making what they do and not being famous &gt;
---
Nice.
---
Hey. I have a question that can be solved with the raw data. Should I use the raw data?
---
If you find the amount of **headaches** you'll get to be tolerable, streamer servers will probably host events or more likely to organize crazy 1000s vs. 1000s world PvP events.
---
There's like 10 discords per server already because people just wanna be admin of something.
---
You're better off waiting until launch, the top players will congregate onto one discord and that'll be the only one that matters.
---
wut
---
It was super funny and no one got hurt and it was all over in 30 minutes. 
---
Super toxic? What? Lol...
---
I mean if your physically incapable of switching servers the day before launch when you have literally not played a single minute of the game. Then yea sure.
---
Guess we are not getting rid of layering anytime soon...
---
I was leaning toward RP-PVP, but I'm east coast. Maybe there will still be raiding on an east coast schedule though, since some people in the east want to be on an RP-PVP server. Maybe there's some advantage to missing some of the west coast peak time?
---
I'm not sure what I want to do now, still go RP-PVP, or roll one of the east coast time PvP servers.
---
They dont want to let people know to prevent being camped and/or griefed by people intentionally following then around and tagging mobs. It makes perfect sense.
---
TukUI and SpartanUI also did not work for me. I understand that on TukUI's website, it is stated under development, however other sites did not carry that description forward.
---
they are purposely trying to avoid each other...  
---
that should tell you everything you need to know
---
Timer to switch between layers. 2mins or so
---
It won't matter after phase one...
---
Maybe I'm the big dumb, but was there no option for increasing the view distance? Didn't see anything like that in the brief time I was on last night
---
Your "dick move" is kind of an entitled thing to say. These guys don't owe you anything lmao.
---
WE WALK THE STREETS AT NIGHT
---
WE GO WHERE EAGLES DARE
---
It's the social aspect of the game everyone has forgotten, everyone just wants I start gratification without the need to work or in this case, wait for it.
---
Well, they did say they're an idiot.
---
If we're going to stop being dependant on layering, you can at most have 15k population (not concurrently online) per server. I see no way that will be the case.
---
I just hope that Blizzard gives out free realm transfers if the situation arises that we are nearing phase 2 and it's still impossible to remove layers.
---
Streamers were saying they are gonna try for NA-East.
---
And I doubt they would go PVE. PVP is gonna make things interesting for people watching the streams.
---
 
---
Like it says in the title looking for a level partner for classic wow going to try speed lvl to 60 ill be playing whole day aka 24 hours so if you can do that would be great! (yes being serious)
---
also i love banter to keep it fun and fresh for the long run for lvl 60 ill be playing Orc warr so let me know if you want to join me on Augest 26th at 22:00 GMT :) Thank you for reading my Post and good luck in Classic wow!
---
#Illidan4lyfe
---
It hurts me that you're so right.
---
Guess that means we are not getting rid of layering anytime soon
---
Said about 10 servers.   I am a mother fucking genius, am I not?
---
Alliance or Horde. Thats really the only choice. 1% extra dodge chance does not help you for min maxing. Though Night Elves look cooler and got front flips.
---
No we are not done, because you have absolutly no case to rest.. People will be rerolling enchanting like mad and many people wont even level pofessions while leveling, that is why the will need the low level enchanting mats when they hit 60.. I really dont understand where your confidence comes from, you are so obviously damn clueless about anything about wow, so why do you keep talking?
---
Now I rest my fucking case and hope your thick skull will let in some information just this one time.
---
Drop layering for an weekend and after tje backlash turn it back on because the community wanted it..
---
If there was no player cap the two eu pvp servers would have 1 mil each
---
can you really not see the sarcasm in his comment? They're not going on the RP PVP realm
---
If they want an authentic vanilla experience - don't stream classic?
---
That is a pve (normal) server right?
---
Neckbeard problems.
---
They did mention warlocks.  It's in [the post about hunter fixes](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/hunter-beta-issues-update/223166/21):
---
&gt; There is a slight delay on  Hunter and  Warlock pet's auto-cast abilities
---
The number of realms is surprising enough, but I can't believe the ratio of PvP to PvE. PvE has NEVER been that close in ratio to PvP. Guess we'll see how this pans out
---
he didn't say Kappa.
---
I picked it because it would be my first choice, today.
---
Server name doesn't really matter much to me though, and if Herod is still heavily the #1 closer to launch, then my friends and I will probably change to a different server.
---
I imagine many people without pre-release guilds will do the same, so it'll be interesting to see how it all pans out.
---
Yes, so they're different. Things being different is why people come up with new namings. Instead of everything being a "house" we've split it up into convenient categories like an apartment or a mansion that convey what we're *actually* talking about. And that's exactly why people need to using the same moniker for two completely different implementations.
---
Cropped the relevant [part.](https://i.imgur.com/8SWp1q7.jpg)
---
Well fuck. I'll still roll on RP-PvP but this will be a bummer. 
---
Only 6 realms, should've guessed none of them would be safe :/
---
The followers ruin zones, immersion, and it creates literal twitch chat
---
I ran 10 man Strat several times.
---
They are all EU? Why are you downvoting me over this?
---
Only paying :) ?
---
I used a couple of heavy duty U shape brackets.    Normally used for hangin ladders etc for storage.  A bit industrial for in a house but as you say, these puppies are weighty.   
---
Took me a long time to find something suitable.   Most household brackets are just not strong enough for these.
---
We had a guild that leveled entirely together, and spent time in each PVP bracket doing premade PVP for the reputation grind. To get our BiS gear at each bracket, we would do 10 man raids on the dungeons we needed to farm.
---
This allowed us to A) clear higher level content B) Reduce the XP gained in the dungeon C) enjoy dungeons in a way we'd never experienced before.
---
I would be very sad if I couldn't replicate my classic experience in classic wow.
---
They are actively hiring positions for that office. They haven't moved anything and as far as I know it was mostly spared from the layoffs. Not sure what you are talking about. As a local Austin person I can say it's definitely not mostly closed.
---
Asmon in particular attracts really young and immature viewers which is why I'm avoiding his server.  I'm not going to avoid streamers like MadSeason and Kevin Jordan.  In fact, I'd enjoy being on their server.
---
For once in my life, I'm going to give Blizzard the benefit of a doubt, and trust that they're not going to fuck up the launch of Classic.
---
I hope that they have some sort of actual plan, or at least respond to realm feedback before release.
---
this exactly
---
Heads up there is a big NY horde guild that has formed. We have our first irl hang scheduled for the 24th as well! If a more community oriented guild interests you pm me for a discord invite. The plan for now is probably just a pvp server though.
---
There is also an alliance guild forming to take us on if that‚Äôs more your style
---
The reasoning is pretty smart, actually.
---
If they can reserve their names, it makes it safer for them to announce which server they are playing on so that others can choose whether they want to play with them or avoid them.
---
This would benefit everyone in the best way possible. It doesn't make sense for people to get upset at the idea of this, unless they wanted to 'steal' a streamer's name to troll.
---
Can you blame people? It's impossible to find Dunkirk in the Barrens.
---
Here‚Äôs some quick math: 12 eu servers + 11 NA + 2 oceanic = 25 servers * 3000 server pop (‚Äúvanilla-like server cap‚Äù) = 75,000 players? Is the 3,000 server pop a concurrent number and not a cap? Let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs concurrent, and concurrent is 1/10th of total pop. That means they seriously are expecting 750,000 players? Lol
---
What kind of fucking ‚Äúintellectual‚Äù bullshit is this lmao
---
Who fucking cares. Let them pick I so i can go elsewhere.
---
wtf is herod?  Sounds like a fish
---
It looks like he's completely joking.
---
So when you have to things that are both food you can call them both food or more specifically you could call them banana and cracker.  You're sitting here pointing at the cracker and saying it's not food because it's not shaped like a banana.
---
if 1 million players are staying longterm we have 1/6th to 1/10th of the required realms. Without layering you get 3k as an absolute max online at a time. You can not have 100k players on a server and only let 3k be online at a time, that's self explanatory. This is far too few realms for 1m. This is suited for somewhere around 100k-150k players.
---
No he has not, ive watched it the past hour(s). Its an idea he has, its not confirmed in any way, just an idea.
---
TETSUUOOOOO
---
I mean you used deodorant so saying you were a complete neckbeard wouldn't be accurate
---
Aside from not enoguh... america has much better server names lmao
---
still recommend for solo leveling warriors, seemed to be fairly easy to keep up herbalism on the stress test, though it only went to 15. just grabbed it in IF instead of Elwynn to combat the zerg
---
default plates do the same, i dont like it. got used to seeing nameplates from 40m away.
---
I can upload to wallpaper engine if anyone would like me to!
---
These "servers" are probably virtual and  on some cloud based architecture. Spinning up a new server could literally be as easy as pressing a button.
---
I mean at the end of the day its only a 1 hour difference from cst to eastern, so it really means nothing. Additionally, you can also just have a cst only guild if you really want to.
---
Haha well hey if you have any other questions let me know. :) Druid will be extremely viable in the first 3 and possibly 4 phases. World pvp is such a massive aspect of the game and I find that druid is the most fun open world to play.
---
Some streamers may also not want to be ostracized and avoided, making a server mostly reliant on their fanbase.
---
Please post it (x2)
---
"For the average-obese gamer" Hahaha I'm fucking dying üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
It literally doesn't matter.
---
I personally prefer the old models, just the sight of the new undead models and animations makes me want to puke.
---
That said i don't really see a problem (besides maybe some clipping issues) to make it a toggle option for people who prefer the new ones (they are the only ones who see them anyway).
---
Never could take wow seriously after they ignored the playerbase and just gutted the male undead and took a giant shit all over his corpse when they made tmorph bannable. I'll never forget and i'll never forgive blizzard for that and i hope the guy who made the new models/animations gets struck by a fucking lightning.
---
"I am not amused."
---
Absolutely love the set up btw that's what I'm hoping to do with my space soon

Thanks for that, might be cool to get a crossover going sometime or keep in touch with the other group mods.

So much for avoiding streamers lol.

Got a Belgian/Dutch guild coalition going here, we're going Shazzrah. (horde side)

You've never attended AQ gate opening on actual blizz servers have you?

HURRRRR sorry man I can't fully take the wit. It's just next level.
---
Rule 3 report them.  I did
---
I don‚Äôt get why people are so against merging servers.
---
However it‚Äôs damn near impossible to split a server. You can‚Äôt just separate friends and guildies at random. Free server transfers are a solution but it never seemed very successful to me.
---
If you think the answer is anything other than Herod you're delusional.
---
&gt; These personal insults are against rule 2 of this sub. I feel like we went over this once already during this conversation.
---
Does it seem like I care about you needing the adults to protect your fragile ego, that you are trying to boost with clueless shit?
---
but still has zero bearing on your mistaken "people will need low level enchant mats as they will change gear constantly needing new enchants at 60"
---
How do you expect me to not insult you when you make up fake shit I never said? I never ever fucking said anything close to what you just quoted me for and it completely changes the entire meaning of what I said.. That is actually straight up illegal in the real society, and here you are caring about the rules of a subreddit..
---
We are not in an agreement that im mistaken, you are literally making up fake quotes to try and win a case that you are absolutly lost about, while still trying to act like you are so right about everything.. You are literally the worst person ive ever had an argument with on reddit.. People like you are what ruins most things in the world..

Im someone who wants to "Complete" classic wow because I never got to when I was only a kid back in 2006 when I first played. I never did the raids, and this time round me and my friend are going to take it far more seriously with some min maxing, whilst also not being completely stupid. We just want to keep up with those who are slightly ahead.  Can someone tell me whether to play on the RP-pvp relam or just pvp realm. Im not much for RP but my friend is, I just hope that people on the RP pvp server intend to still clear content and pvp (basically still be a competitive server) Anyone can help the pros and cons?
---
not to mention he possibility of 10 carrots, 1 hammer, 1 run
---
There are plenty of private servers without cross-realm BGs that you can play on if you want the true 'classic' experience, which involves dropping your trousers for the handful of elite premades that spray shit on the Battleground experience.
---
Boo this man!!! Booooooo!

A rose by any other name will smell just as sweet.

Why the hell is there so many people posting about streamers?

Just enjoy the game.
---
The more you talk about them the more popular they get.
---
And I would expect atleast 2-3 times as many will play classic than there are people on this subreddit. And that is very conservative.
---
"Due to overwhelming engagement from our english-european servers, we can sadly not remove layering in phase 1, but will work on having it removed by the end of phase 6. Thank you for your patience :) "

Blizzard will reserve their names for them beforehand.
---
Nah fam. I'll be farming devilsaurs and getting that epic mount.
---
PvP trinket takes one slot, and I'll likely end up with the onyxia trinket and/or engineering trinkets in the other.
---
How is their experience going to be any different if they announce their server or not? Seriously, how? The people that want to play with them will do it regardless. Their names will be taken. Their streams will be sniped. Not announcing their server won't change that in any way.
---
Some scandinavian (mostly swedish i guess) will announce where they go [here](http://nordicclassic.jinnis.se/)
---
Ohhh no how can you possibly enjoy the game...
---
Nope.  They don't need 8 million players and a good reputation anymore.  They can make more money for less investment with a fraction of the population and effort by selling stuff.
---
What makes you say that? Just curious do you think long term there isn‚Äôt viability?
---
Yea this just seem unecessarily complicated. If they notice the populations be super high, theyre gonna add another one after what?
---
Because populations WILL be high  due to there only being 2 realms and the only options and if they add one like a week or 2 later people arent gonna be super keen on starting over or "being behind" for some. 
---
I dont see why they wouldnt add 1 more and then have like another 1 on standby.
---
Tell that to ppl that played in Vanilla on Agamaggan. That server was full of Spanish players
---
There's some efficient grinding spots between 30-40 that don't slow you down and net huge amounts of leather.
---
people are already complaining about realm names, lmao
---
That reminds me.... 40 man raids that required attunement were, if I recall correctly, one of the (many) things that doomed Wildstar, .
---
Well it never made it last longer.  "Old kidney shot" is meaningless.
---
Explain me how a streamer is a special person that deserve favouritism ? Asmongold could have a char name "BouBou" and people would still want to lick his boots... 
---
The is NO impact on their job in the end if they have their name or not... But there is an impact for the person that will take Esfand or Assmongole name.
---
Golemagg sounds more saxon though, I cant imagine spaniards can handle being confronted with a double g for the rest of their time on classic

Why do you have to ruin retail though? Why can't WoW classic become the game you used to love?
---
Btw, difficult dungeons exist in BFA, and you even had to get attuned for some of them.
---
I've played on vanilla private servers and had total existential crises over my class choice when I'm like level 45. Or the same thing about race choices at level 20ish. It's awful.
---

This whole thing is a real oligarch‚Äôs power play, just exceptionally dickish. I was fairly indifferent to streamers as a whole until now. Have some common decency Jesus Christ. Dealing with stream snipers is a part of the deal. Straight up comes with the territory. Whiny little weiners (I recognize the irony) who are too self important to consider the majority of people which they will negatively affect. Honestly it just comes off as arrogant, and almost like a ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù to the classic WoW community that has been very vocal about their feelings toward streamers. I guess what I‚Äôm trying to say is I can‚Äôt see most streamers getting in line for a quest mob, y‚Äôknow? This is an entitled move and it really pisses me off. I‚Äôve been stoked for the server name drop for a while now but now I feel I can‚Äôt decide until I know I won‚Äôt be dealing with the baggage and bitumen of a streamer server. Idk maybe I‚Äôm the whiny one but this sucks. I appreciate that they‚Äôre all playing on the same server, though the cynic in me suggests that this decision came from a self serving place, and not a considerate one.
---
I wasn't aware Texans had a certain way they look, but okay. If you think of a Texan you probably don't think of the kind of person who lives in Austin OR Houston.
---
i would like to know this too plz.
---
&gt;literally MILLIONS (FUCKING MILLIONS) of people are gonna be playing this game at release  
---
&gt;Classic is going to be bigger than FUCKING FORTNITE for at least a month
---
Alright Bobbo, not only you grossly overestimate the amount of players Classic will have, but you also forget that the overwhelming majority of those that *will* play will only do so for a short period before leaving. If Blizzard makes too many servers, you'll end up with ghost towns. Dead servers *are not cool* in this oh-so-community-driven game.
---
I'm actually concerned that they could be opening *too many.*
---
It really won‚Äôt be a big deal, this sub is full of boomers that have a phobia of streamers. You won‚Äôt hardly notice them in your every day play, I wouldn‚Äôt worry about it. People here seem to think asmons cronies can infiltrate every zone simultaneously
---
soda claims he wont be streaming classic wow
---
No it will be very easy to rank, with only 2 servers and layering, how many people will be in the same brackets ?   
---
With 20k+ people on server, damn you will get such a big bracket 1, so you will almost be able to get a guild to rank 14 at the same time.
---
They're running out of things to cry about so we're now back to streamers.
---
Yeah I'm just hoping it's not Thalnos ;)
---
Yes I am well aware of that overtuning. A Feral in threat gear already generated significantly more threat than a threat-geared Warrior on private servers without MCP. Taking a 30% penalty and then adding the MCP on top of that will still handily outperform a Warrior.
---
As I stated, Bear tanks are *the best* farm content tanks for Alliance on virtually every boss fight. That is not sub-optimal. Your definition of "tanking better" strictly applies to hard-hitting progression boss fights like Nefarian and Huhuran. For progression, a Feral will tank Fankriss, Sartura, Skeram, Three Drakes, Razorgore, and virtually every boss in MC better than a Warrior even on progression because they do more damage and the DPS outputs of those bosses are irrelevant. Using this subjective definition, a Feral tank is better than a Prot tank.
---
So which one do we take for Horde?
---
Would you mind adding the language question to the NA servers, so that we can see via the raw data where the unofficial BR/SP servers might end up being?
---
In my zone 5 people didnt wanna take them lmao
---
Why do you hope that they will ruin retail WoW? Why not hope that they will invest more money in Classic to add more Classic style content?
---
/r/Grobbulus
---
OG wow servers (as in the ones that launched the game) were capped to 3000 active player connections iirc however I don't know if they had a cap in terms of how many people could make toons on the server
---
At least they are rolling on the same server
---
Fuuuuuuuuuccccckkkkkkkkkk meeeeeeeee soooooooo hard. I booked 28th, 29th and 30th off
---
Wait so they are making a RP-PVP server? I thought they weren‚Äôt
---
Launch doesn‚Äôt matter, how many people are actually gonna sub to steal a streamer name 2 weeks prior to release? Like I said, you overestimate the fan base.
---
&gt; Trolls cant Steal their names.
---
I agree with everything but this. Since some streamers are already offering money for their names, people would like a chance to snipe and sell. Time is money friend.
---
yes it did in Vanilla Wow.
---
After making my post I thought about it a bit more. My post is under the assumption that there will be longevity, but Blizzard made these servers under the assumption that most people will quit this game, so we'll have to see who's right.
---
During leveling, almost certainly will be feral / enh combo. I think Druid and Shaman are the most fun classes to play, so you certainly will have a ton of fun.
---
PRO: Your survivability will be insane. Both have mele / spell casting dps capabilities, both have a variety of heals perfect for anysituation, tons of utility skills, both have defencive skills and capabilities. I cannot see many enconters that a feral druid + shaman of any spec wont be able to handle during leveling. 
---
PRO: Getting dungeon groups will be a sinch. Leveling as feral druid you will be able to tank all non end game dungeons with your leveling spec, just click into bear form. Same gear, same talents. Shaman rolling enh likely will have enough mana to heal you without gear changes, worse case, swaps out a couple peices for intel stack gear.  If shaman goes ele for leveling, no gear switch or talent switch required. DPS is plentiful to fill those other spots. 
---
PRO: world PVP and BGs will be great to dabble in. Both have insane survivability, some CC, heals, etc. If you guys work well together in the PVP realm, this could make leveling easier. Also, dropping into the casual BG will be fun.
---
PRO: Travel form and spirit wolf. Both will be traveling as increased speeds pre mount. Also, both can postpone mount purchase a few levels without that big of a deal (Watch the video on the druid when its best to mount or travel form. Its surprisingly not frequently better to mount). This works great for run quests, follows, everything. dont over look this Pro!
---
CON: competitive PVE will find the two of you competing for some of the same gear, since you both will likely roll healers. The druid will have a slightly harder time getting that raid heals spot if your doing pregression raiding. Just means that someone (liekly the shaman) will get that trinket, neck, ring before the other if doing loot counsil. Could get old. 
---
CON: the shaman totem class quests take a bit of time and running around. The druid only has the one class quest they HAVE to do (lvl 10), the rest are fairly optional. The shaman kinda needs their totems. So, druid will either be tagging along on a time consuming quest chain for the shaman with little reward for the time spent. (I guess they could do profs during this time, or go outside...)
---
CON: During leveling, pre-lvl 40, there is a lot of gear overlap. The enh shaman will want the same gear as the feral druid. If the shaman is ele, this is less of an issue, but ele is considered a slower leveling spec than enh. post 40, shaman gets mail, which gives them a greater chance to get gear the druid cant roll on, the druid may get frustrated with the loot distribution during leveling since the shaman can usually always benefit from the drop, but post 40, some drops are shaman only.
---
I look forward to conquering your crossroads.
---
As much as I have nothing against any streamer I can't deal with their zerg/sperg viewers and im hoping that Forsen announces soon so I can have a sigh of relief to know he won't be on my server. He easily has the worst viewers next to asmongold and sodapoppin.
---
Minutes is plural and doesn't specify a finite quantity, so really if it took them 3 years it would still be within minutes.
---
&gt; Disagree about tanking
---
Why? I don't know Warriors in-depth, but he seems right to me.
---
- Superior HP;
---
- Superior damage: bear white attacks are big;
---
- Better single target threat generation: cus Maul crits modifier, and Druids crits a lot since we have high agi + 9% from talents. Also Maul alone generates a lot of threat anyway. When you get a Maul crit on a mob you basically don't even need to hit it ever again, it dies before you can lose aggro most of the times. Unless it's a boss ofc;
---
- Better AoE threat generation: pre-pull HoTs + Swipe spam + Thorns + Challenging Roar (is there a Warrior's equivalent for this one?), and you can easily tank 3-4+ mobs being AoE'd without losing aggro, while warriors have... Cleave with it's big ass rage cost? Battle Shout? Thunder Clap does even count? Or just tab spam sunder armor?  Serious question, I don't know how warrs deal w/ AoE pulls, but I can't imagine it being better than druid;
---
- Helps healer's mana: pre-pull HoTs saves a lot of healer's mana and ofc Innervate after lvl 40. As a tank, you don't need to save it, so you can provide a full mana bar to healer every 6 min;
---
- Better buffs: While battle shout is only useful for 2-3 party members usually, Mark of the Wild is useful for everyone at all times. Stats provided by MotW are also way better for 5-men run than a flat AP buff, even for AP classes imo. I don't even going to say much about Thorns, it's just beautiful. While Warrior can access it too, obviously they will not have it everytime;
---
- Better CC (maybe): both classes have badly limited CC capabilities on dungeons, but I still would say Druid's CC is a bit more useful. Intimidating Shout can be used on almost every dungeon, but it has a long cd, costs big rage (if I remember correctly) and there are rare places/situations where you can safely use it without taking the risk of aggroing other packs. While Druid's CCs are more reliable, has no cd BUT can't be used on a lot of dungeons. Beasts are quite common (dragonkin not so much) in dungeons so Hibernate has a bit more use, but Roots I think can only be used at Deadmines (docks) and Zul'Farrak, at least this is how it worked on that pserver;
---
- Instant "plate armor" at level 40: When you get 40 as a Druid, you access Dire Bear Form that's basically readjusts bear's armor to match plate armor instantly. Bears at 40-45 level range are just ridiculous. I believe warriors can take several levels to replace every mail tank piece probably?
---
The only con I can think in comparison to warrs is not being able to safely pot, which essentially is the same problem of not having Shield Wall (I won't count Last Stand, since 99% of warrs don't have this during leveling) and the problem is: if someone screws, you're dead, there's no emergency button. Well, depending on the situation it can be possible to bash&gt;unshift&gt;pot&gt;shift again, but better not count on it really.
---
With great power, comes great responsibility.

As long as I'm not on asmons server I'm ok. That's the one dude I don't want to be anywhere near.

No it didn't.  Ever.

Except that if everyone does this, all their names will be taken and they'll have to pick new unknown ones, and we're right back to square one.

All the big servers are grouping on an east coast pvp server so you don‚Äôt need to worry. Small streamers won‚Äôt cause any issues for you
---
Got the first server kill (I assume) of Hogger on the Rp-pvp server
---
Separate but equal segregated servers? Are you also going to tell us streamers are 3/5s of a person?
---
no shit it was rude, he 100% could have worded it in a nicer way, but that doesn't mean its "toxic" lmao no matter how badly people want EVERYTHING now a days to be "toxic" its honestly not.

It is. Don't ask me why Blizzard did it this way.  Probably not a big difference between Miami, Atlanta, etc.
---
I wish they'd at least tell us which type of server they're going to play on.
---
Isn‚Äôt staysafe from Portland? He‚Äôs gonna have really high ping on an east coast server.
---
They are probably just coordinating with eachother to see WHERE they want to roll.
---
They have a larger amount of people to ask opinions of; and most of you think that Streamers are inherintly selfish, they are not really. They want opinions from everyone, Not just Asmongold picking one and they all follow suite. 
---
Give them some time. Create a "Herod is the server we choose, and Thalnos is the server we choose if they choose that server"
---
Why would an eastern server be in Chicago?
---
The movie he's talking about is "thexinator 3: rise of the Shaman Machines" btw
---
if there is a lot of spanish speaking people in NA servers they can form their own guilds and still be on the server...
---
its not a big deal
---
(East coast servers are located in Chicago) 
---
So you don‚Äôt get the time zone but you get solid latency. 
---
Mountain has the least population and is only 1 hour a head of LA and the worst ping you‚Äôll have from civilization (sucks to suck if you‚Äôre in the sticks) out west to LA is like 80
---
75,000 x Layers..  SO if they have 5 layers on a server, thats 5 times as many players playing at the same time . and maybe there are 10 layers, who knows.
---
This is about all I have been hoping for.
---
Human Rogue üòàüòàüòà and thats awesome will happy for you!
---
can you extrapolate from this where eastern european population will go?
---
yes, no shit, he 100% could have worded it in a nicer way. but its still how a lot of people feel. and what he said wasn't "toxic" no matter how badly people want everything ever that isn't "nice" or "neutral" to be "toxic".
---
Thexinator 2 was better
---
A server can't hold hundreds of thousands of players without layers though, so I'm not sure what they're hoping for come phase 2.
---
A name from a deleted caracter becomes avilable immediately. Please use searchbar og google.
---
How is that oversimplification? Is it that you think this is a complex argument to begin with? Classic WoW isn't Retail WoW. More than that Classic WoW exists specifically to please people that don't like retail. I guess that the fact they both have WoW in the name is too much for someone like you to deal with.
---
According to private servers, average /played to 60 is about 260 hours. 200 hours is generous.
---
&gt; sounds like some fat grumpy bank manager
---
[???](https://wow.gamepedia.com/High_Inquisitor_Fairbanks)
---
Yeah, you're absolutely correct.  I think it is a virtual certainty that he will play.  My sentence was worded poorly.
---
I should have said "I don't know where he lives or where he will play (server/timezone)."
---
https://youtu.be/MEpv7YxnLCQ
---
At first maybe but I imagine the population will dwindle quickly. I think it's a good amount for sustained populations.
---
and the realms are split out on different language users which usually means lower pop since it's a targeted audience. So yeah.. Can't wait for the 20k queue servers come phase2.
---
What the hell does the server name matters, LOL. You see that shit on login and that's it, big woop.
---
It's his followers I'm scared of. Being on a server with streamers is actually pretty good, as they host a bunch of server wide events, the only problem is that the server is filled with people I don't like. 
---
I'm still salty I had to listen to his drones parrot the memes he said about survival hunter at least 10 times every week for the entire expansion. He has a ton of sway in the community, but honestly his opinions are usually wrong but treated as the truth.
---
Why do you need a PvP realm when you have the Demilitarised zone between you and NK.
---
I am claiming that I ran 10-man Strat several times. I didn't state whether I agree or not that OP is wrong or right. You seem wound up.
---
Read the TLDR.  That is wrong.
---
And what's the definition of toxic?
---
I didn't create the data centers. Just posting what I found.
---
Never, error speech off or /rope for life
---
Not if the new servers are released within 2-4 weeks. It's different when people have already settled and "bored" and waiting for a fresh start and economy.
---
I've personally taken a week off to play some classic when it releases, hype is the highest etc. Going to suck if it ends up with insane queues constantly. Also I plan to play quite a lot within that first week, so not going to reroll and play the early game again because blizzard couldn't care to open more servers at launch.
---
Well yeah, but that's a given. I doubt there will be any server with 90% alliance or horde though.
---
Esfand is cool though
---
Differences between, PvP and RPPvP server..
---
Better names, and more people cybering in goldshire and the stormwind park.
---
Thats not going to say a lot though, i played on that "unofficial" spanish server for the whole of Vanilla, and up to the point the spanish got their own servers it was terrible at times, not because Spanish ppl are not nice, but just that a lot of them don't speak english at all. One of the first things i said when Classic was announcen, "need to make sure not to roll on the spanish server again if they don't get own realms". Although i made a ton of spanish friends there, i dont want to have that experience again. Especially since the server basicly died after they left since like 80% of the population was gone and it took very long to slightly recover
---
At least you got a German server...
---
why does server time matter, at all?
---
Oh is that really so? My bad then, but could you provide some source?
---
I mean, there aren't that many servers.  They could still easily have their names sniped.
---
You're that guy ! The one all the red circles on facebook are for.

There's no way in hell this is true lmao
---
apes has been wanting to go ally from day one.
---
30k active players on a server is not a good server community. There are 160k people on this sub, so if we split them into the 5 PvP servers were left with 32,000 each. Of my guild of 20, only two use reddit and I‚Äôm the only one on this sub....Blizzard is about to royally fuck this launch up and those servers are going to be awful!
---
Nice!  My first was a gnome mage, but I‚Äôm going horde this time.  Perhaps we will meet in the fields of blood.

INV TO FUNERAL LAYER
---
yeah it was my guess since they've announced phasing but that pretty much confirms it.

But if i wait a few weeks to delete the first named toon when the amount of people reserving names dies down I can just delete and make a new one immediately no? I would only be risking a minute at most right?

---
Only way new realms in a week or two will work is, if people can instantly migrate there for free. Still complicates things unnecessarily.
---
We're gonna need a bigger ~~boat~~ RP-PVP server
---
&lt;3
---
you would probably hit around 150 is ms, enough to be noticeable but not enough that it would impact much, unless the latency fluctuates.
---
Works for me. All my hand-wringing is probably pointless. Nothing new there.
---
Ohhh now that I rewatch the original video knowing what to look for I see that the "crackly" one is the current (bad) one, which makes more sense. I initially thought you had the vanilla 1.12 clip on the left in the imgur post and I was like "Well the new one looks way better then..."
---
But it's the good looking rounded one that is original and should be in. And I agree that it looks way better.
---
The feral druid tank deficiency is vastly overstated. Do not worry about this. As a druid tank, you will always be trying to overcome that stigma.
---
Why technically true that ally druid tanks have a slight advantage via the numbers, this is marginal. Dont let it change your decision.  I dont the deficiency here is enough to say that feral druids suck. the fact of the matter is, that people will still take you.
---
Also, no real issue with dungeon tanking, your only real worry is for raid tanking. In raids, youll likely not make MT unless your rediculously good and dedicated. If your content with OT, it shouldnt be hard to get OT spots. 
---
Also, from my understanding Tank spec Druid DPS'ing &gt; Prot spec warrior DPSing. So if your 3rd string tank, youll spend hlaf your time DPSing, and will benefit the raid well. Someone please comment on this for horde side, does windfury on a prot tank close the DPS gap on horde?
---
Vanilla wow raid sizes are huge, and if a group can 3 man ony, i think the world will continue to turn if a guild squeezes in a feral druid here or there. 
---
Druids are not \*that bad\*, and horde druid will still be able to tank. You likely will only run into issues if your doing hard core progression raiding where the guild min/maxes everything. If your considering rolling Druid with your friends, not likely going to be an issue for you.
---
If you re-read this thread, I think you‚Äôll see my confusion. You‚Äôre in a thread about OP being right or wrong.
---
The names for PvP kinda suck IMO.
---
Which is why you form a guild and recruit players who play in MT or CST time. Like the timezones on the servers are a construct. 
---
If you wanted to, you could go all over reddit and the Blizzard forums designating all CST players to play on certain servers, which in effect, makes the server a de facto CST server. Like there's a simple, not easy, but simple response to this issue. Spread the word that all CST players should play on one PvP and one PvE server to concentrated their numbers.
---
Quality shitpost
---
"Hi, I'm &lt;name&gt; and I play on Zandalar Tribe." Please, it's fucking embarrassing.
---
Huh, I thought there wouldn't be any RP-PVP servers. Nice to see they decided to add them!
---
Created a Subreddit and Discord for Paggle:
---
Discord- https://discord.gg/2QkXnVa
---
Subreddit- /r/PaggleClassic
---
Currently at work but plan to add more to them later.
---
Why herod?
---
if there was a server called Cumguzzler I would be all over that one. Fuck Stormscale and Al'Akri I wanna play on Cumguzzler.
---
Names are immediately available after deletion.
---
"Make sure you do this" is hardly a kind request. Sounds entitled, actually.
---
If they renamed the starting area Shaman trainer to Thex, I'd be happy.
---
Someone needs a juice box and a nap.
---
Everyone on the server required to have 300 fishing by 60.
---
Just report anyone not communicating in English on an English speaking server.
---
Will do! Give me a few to get it all launched up
---
Because that's where they put them?
---
I‚Äôm almost proud of this screen shot, even if it is disgusting alliance dogs
---
There's actually also an addon that did this for you that's also been around since vanilla.
---
if you know the rought area where the server are located, then you can run a speed test to a server close to it, see which one gives you the best result (ping) and use that.
---
For druid pvp you're shifting out so the time to cast spells and heal anyway. Grenades just become another spell you have in caster form. Also all the trinkets can be used in form. I'm unsure about the boots and helmets.
---
WOD single handedly ruined being social. No longer would people just dick around in stormwind or the new capitols. It was your own private instance where everyone loved you and gave you presents every day! Huray!
---
So glad classic is coming soon..
---
Because it's way too early for them to have even made a decision.
---
They certainly do. Kill a pack, wait for him to drink, rinse, repeat  
---
They can do some impressive AoE tanking though, but that drinking downtime is a real dealbreaker for me personally.
---
added
---
Why can't we have a Pacific RP server and an Eastern RP-PvP? Doesn't seem fair.
---
Kinky
---
If this sub loves vanilla so much why is there no appetites for more content in this paradigm?
---
Who says the storyline needs to fork? They don‚Äôt need to be any ‚Äúmajor‚Äù events, isn‚Äôt that one of the attractive parts of vanilla? The fact that we are the ‚ÄúChampion‚Äù.
---
Consider Dire Maul, would a citizen in Stormwind have any clue that adventurers did a bunch of stuff there? Hell, would they even know it exists?
---
In my proposal the story doesn‚Äôt move forward.
---
Retail has a ton of CST servers so that argument is null.
---
Correct. Many people are doing this strategy by reserving the name instantly with no customization only to recreate the character later.
---
Lol, read the whole post. You don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about. He clearly states that some dungeons had player limits added by the end of vanilla and others didn‚Äôt.
---
Lol no it's not. It might not be as ideal as having the perfect number of servers right now but its definitely not too late. They would be able to have new servers before classic even starts.
---
I'm building a kbd75 just for classic so I can get those precious F-Keys back in my life.
---
I am hoping it is as well balanced as ED was when I played there.
---
There are 5 pvp servers
---
Gotcha, thank you!
---
&gt; Most people do not know how to fight a druid.
---
Love that you made this point. Played a druid on a pserver cause I didn't want to burn out of a class I *actually* might play in classic. I'm playing druid now. So many times I'd encounter a hunter or warrior that by all means should have beat me in a given situation and I was just left thinking, man that guy does not know how to fight a druid lol.
---
Me: Pacific server, Normal, Horde.  Should be streamer-proof.
---
Realistically not too much unless you end up close to them and their groupies.
---
Yup,  probably gonna be Fairbanks for me.
---
I greatly enjoy consuming the devil's lettuce, but oh boy do I despise talking about it and the lame culture around it.
---
Why should they care about you? Or anybody else whos trying to "avoid them" they care about themselves, dont wanna get overrun by streamsnipers and toxic people who fuck with them.
---
I mean it's not hard for them to add additional servers.  I swear to god, people think blizzard are so fucking dumb, and everyone on this reddit is a genius.
---
-Superior HP;
---
-Superior damage: bear white attacks are big;
---
-Better single target threat generation: cus Maul crits modifier, and Druids crits a lot since we have high agi + 9% from talents. Also Maul alone generates a lot of threat anyway. When you get a Maul crit on a mob you basically don't even need to hit it ever again, it dies before you can lose aggro most of the times. Unless it's a boss ofc;
---
-Better AoE threat generation: pre-pull HoTs + Swipe spam + Thorns + Challenging Roar (is there a Warrior's equivalent for this one?), and you can easily tank 3-4+ mobs being AoE'd without losing aggro, while warriors have... Cleave with it's big ass rage cost? Battle Shout? Thunder Clap does even count? Or just tab spam sunder armor?  Serious question, I don't know how warrs deal w/ AoE pulls, but I can't imagine it being better than druid;
---
-Helps healer's mana: pre-pull HoTs saves a lot of healer's mana and ofc Innervate after lvl 40. As a tank, you don't need to save it, so you can provide a full mana bar to healer every 6 min;
---
-Better buffs: While battle shout is only useful for 2-3 party members usually, Mark of the Wild is useful for everyone at all times. Stats provided by MotW are also way better for 5-men run than a flat AP buff, even for AP classes imo. I don't even going to say much about Thorns, it's just beautiful. While Warrior can access it too, obviously they will not have it everytime;
---
-Better CC (maybe): both classes have badly limited CC capabilities on dungeons, but I still would say Druid's CC is a bit more useful. Intimidating Shout can be used on almost every dungeon, but it has a long cd, costs big rage (if I remember correctly) and there are rare places/situations where you can safely use it without taking the risk of aggroing other packs. While Druid's CCs are more reliable, has no cd BUT can't be used on a lot of dungeons. Beasts are quite common (dragonkin not so much) in dungeons so Hibernate has a bit more use, but Roots I think can only be used at Deadmines (docks) and Zul'Farrak, at least this is how it worked on that pserver;
---
-Instant "plate armor" at level 40: When you get 40 as a Druid, you access Dire Bear Form that's basically readjusts bear's armor to match plate armor instantly. Bears at 40-45 level range are just ridiculous. I believe warriors can take several levels to replace every mail tank piece probably?
---
Starting from never played classic and decided to main a druid, just looks kinda fun and being a cat/bear will be juicy
---
You yanks are generally far better craic. It also suits me better for raids etc. to be at 0200 in the morning my time because I have to adult during the day.
---
I think there was around 60 on the actual launch in NA, but then they kept adding more over the 1st few months.
---
I didn't do an exact count, but here's a list of original servers https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Timeline_of_the_creation_of_US_realms.
---
I think it's around 25 each for PvP and PvE, then a few other RP servers.
---
Why are you so focused on PvP servers? People on PvE servers can achieve rank 14 also. I'd be shocked if anyone aiming for Rank 14 would waste their time on World PvP, so that it's a PvP or PvE server is meaningless. The serious Contribution Points grind is done in battlegrounds, not open world.
---
&gt;depends who you ask
---
Exactly.
---
I wonder how many people will be viewing while playing.

I don't know how many servers they're planning to launch with at this point but presumably it's more than 1 per server type in each region.
---
Definitely going "East Coast" then, Chicago is my first ping.  lol
---
People will quit, not even start on launch.. what a horrible idea lol

---
The only time I watched his stream he seemed borderline coked out off of energy drinks haha.
---
Most of the large streamers have agreed to not take anything in trade as streamer privilege until they have their epic mounts.
---
Educated guess on my part. I am now curious what the actual cap was on some of these dungeons in 1.12. Like I wonder how many people tried to run deadlines with 10 people between 1.12 and 2.x.
---
I'm all for those monolingual eu cucks getting their own servers, but limiting english EU to 2 pvp servers is absolutely unacceptable. 20k queues come layer removal mark my words.
---
But which server will you choose
---
Just Kill mobs. Skipped the Quest yesterday and didnt mean anything
---
I don‚Äôt see why they wouldn‚Äôt. If they are all together they get to have big events like beta. That‚Äôs been the reason most of them give to be together
---
right on,  thanks
---
They released the server list.
---
Russia, Germany and France is most of the EU playerbase and they get 3 servers.
---
70% of the European playerbase play on PvP servers
---
Yeah... I‚Äôm figuring out basically all casters we‚Äôre 1 or 2 button rotations in vanilla. Guess I might as well do Mage!
---
Its called a joke. Maybe you should get familiar with the concept of you want to interact with humans without looking like a weirdo
---
Doubt that helps, atleast it didn't in Vanilla and i know that ppl tried. I don't think its against the ToS (atleast in Europe) to talk in other languages. We had servers that were dominated with ppl talking spanish, but also swedish, i've seen hungarian.
---
I say only if they all play on the same server.
---
This is best solution for everyone
---
Argent Dawn is easy to pronounce. Shazzrah is not.
---
Fair enough.
---
I can't find my source again now, but I managed to find some data from a company that made a gaming-overlay app of somekind IIRC, their data had Iceland/Norway/Denmark as the countries in Europe with the highest number of wow players per capita. I know saying the source exists without being able to find it doesn't mean much, and it was sort of nich√© data, so take it with a grain of salt.
---
Except for when you're grouping with a suicidal lock, but eh.. That's on them
---
I read somewhere it is equivalent to adding 1 point in improved stealth on the feral tree, not sure how true that is though.
---
The real problem is that FFXIV is doing casual MMORGP a lot better. WoW could regain market share by going back to their pre-Mists or pre-Cata design ideas.
---
EU players also got 5
---
The locked servers in that tweet were the stress test realms...
---
lol yes because Chicago is centrally located on for central time zone.
---
They give off energy - thalnos is almost thanos and gives off good memetic energy
---
Herod is a very recognizable classic sm boss that dropped iconic lvling gear and whirlwind axe - very high test energy
---
Faerlina - very soft and feminine sounding name, unrecognizable to most - very low energy, will definitely be lowest population out of these three
---
And that means no true vanilla experience for us.
---
I wonder if the servers are larger than originally in vanilla due to layers? I think Nostalrius private server held more players than any vanilla server.
---
I hope you understand and feel shame.
---
There is a pattern with sharding and now lack of servers. Are servers that expensive to have running? There must be some fundamental information or strategy in the background that we simply can't figure out. Of course blizzard want to make money. There is a reason for their decisions. They know communities=$$$.
---
No they are not lol.
---
Yes germany and france make up a decent bunch, but you know what? Not every german or every frenchman plays on national servers. Like 50% of germans don't play german servers, french it's a bit lower but still buddy. It's not even fucking close.
---
&gt;no one lives in CST
---
Hahahaha
---
Surely you could find it quicker
---
I'm so glad I got into the kill Garrick Padfoot line early before it  stretched that far.
---
pretty easy choice to put the tank druid in a group with rogues with instant poison and hunters and the shaman uses GOA to give a 3% crit buff.  Druids do not have cooldowns, which make bosses with enrages impossible or crazy spooky if possible.  Druids will be the king tanks p1 because they can generate way more threat than a warrior decks in p1 bis.  Threat limits are pretty much holding back all of the raid top DPS in p1, 2, and first part of 3.

I made a simple spreadsheet to track NA PvP server responses and A:H ratios if anyone wants to use it.

---
That gnome is frightening.
---
There are not many servers. There will be people attempting to get the Streamer names the second it goes live. No character customization or anything. Then they can reach out to the streamer and offer to delete that character for a price.
---
If I recall from my reading of the WoW Diary, there used to be a data center in Virginia, but that area is prone to getting storms and hurricanes, so it makes sense that they moved it.
---
You don‚Äôt ‚Äúneed‚Äù anything
---
In my world, $15 is better than not having that option at all and being 'basically fucked'?
---
Yeah, had you explained your disappointment it would have been clear that you were just giving your opinion on it. No worries.
---
One RP server? rip me
---
That sounds really strange. How would you coordinate server choice with your friends? If it worked like that you would have no way to guarantee you will be on the same layer. Also I'm pretty sure you change layer if you group up with someone?
---
Je confirme de France.
---
Good. Just like the private servers!

Very informative post, OP. I'll be playing priest and therefore plan on skilling tailoring. Is there any disadvantage if I go with skinning first and re-specc tailoring at a later date?

I'm picking Faerlina as I'm east coast and it appears to have the lower pop. I hope my name reserves aren't wasted when I found out asmon and his band of merry men all rolled on that server
---
It's pretty close to 50/50 right now.
---
&gt;70% of the European playerbase play on PvP servers
---
Given PvP realms in retail don't even exist anymore, that's a great stat to pull out. How exactly do you work that one out?
---
I watched this episode not too long ago and missed it, nice catch
---
5-10% extra time per fight adds up to hours of loss.
---
They are going to drag it out as long as possible.

Hey!  
---
I am trying to run the game via Lutris but it keeps saying that gamemode is inactive. What could be wrong? I even tried running a game via console with *gamemoderun wine64 ./game* and still it's inactive.   
---
Do I need to active gamemode somehow before using it?
---
Shamans are about as popular at 60 as warriors.  Shamans that are not resto will hunt down druids so they can DPS in the dungeons while you get to play the cow in the dress role.
---
Exactly. Its seems dumb to calculate THIS low estimates.
---
This would be true if layering wasn't a thing

Can you share the demographics for horde to Ally ratio on each server? You should have access to this in the data you are collecting
---
Never said they wouldn‚Äôt. Just said I can see why they‚Äôre at least trying and I don‚Äôt blame them. 
---
How about blizzard just get up with all the streamers and blacklist one character name for them ahead of time? Would everyone not be upset then? Or would everyone just be upset that Blizzard is playing favorites then?

Whitemane is clearly the best name among the NA realms, but sadly I've got to go with the Grobb for RPPVP.

Pve is player vs environment

Rp is roleplay

---
I've been having wow dreams lately for the first time in years.
---
It's not going to be as useful as people hoped. Unless they give streamers priority on their names, they will all wait to say where they will go. And people won't want to wait for a streamer to say where they are to grab names. Maybe the streamer doesn't say for a long time, so then people waited too long and lost their name.
---
I say just expect that list to not be helpful, have a backup plan.
---
Looks like a railroad for the hype train.
---
They don't have any data because they kept the beta and stress tests behind limited invites and subs.  This could be a disaster.  But honestly, Blizz has shown that Classic is a consolation prize at best.
---
Since its the only RP-PVP server I would assume its going to be fairly balanced.
---
And beyond.
---
I heard two different times when it may end, 5pm est or midnight est. And no you dont keep your characters sadly
---
if this is what ur enjoyment of classic is based on idk what to say
---
No it's not dead, stop this bullshit
---
The name is so bad its how we will hide from them
---
That will be tough. Horde don't roll on PvE servers.
---
Can you add the NA RPPVP to that one?

And this is 100% a shitpost

Mankrik and Whitman are my bets
---
When the streamers eventually stop logging into Classic, those guilds are going to die fast.  Streamer guilds are mostly sheep just following their shepherd around.

Getting old is rough.

Im not in any way a rude individual, im very very calm and collected, but I have a very hard time dealing with people like you..

Everything I said makes perfect sense, you made ud a fake quote of something I never said and changed the meaning entirely, once again is reading really that hard?
---
My English is fine, considering it is my 3rd language, and it is your first and you are still acting all smug about speaking one language, that you cant even understand very basic sentences in.
---
thanks man
---
It's those damn nor'easters man
---
Okay and where are the real streamers going?
---
Correction : ONLY ONE.
---
Spanish guilds will choose the other. And they alone are like 20k already.

My parents didn't buy me WoW when it first came out so I had to play on my friend's account. Much like we're all doing these days, I spent hours on worldofwarcraft.com trying to figure out what race/class I would play. I finally decided on Night Elf Rogue by the time I was actually able to play at my friend's house. I was so excited to dual wield daggers and use stealth. I had to wait for everyone else to go to bed because he and his two older brothers had priority on their one account. I stayed up literally all night leveling my Rogue. I really got into
---
 In the morning my friend's oldest brother pulled up a chair and watched me play. 
---
He mentioned something about a "Warrior"
---
I said, "No, I rolled a Rogue"
---
He said, "Rogues don't use shields. You have a shield. You're a Warrior."
---
And that's the story of my first Night Elf ~~Rogue~~ Warrior
---
How much exploration experience did you get running there?
---
Blizzard did a bad job communicating all of that info tbh. But you won't be the last one to 60 don't be so dramatic.
---
I think the magic number for pvp EU servers would be 3. 
---
Would still much rather having to deal with too few servers and then having BLizzard start new ones in 1-2 moths, than having a bunch of forever dead servers.
---
&gt; horrific
---
"horrific"
---
And it was a her.
---
And this is why you don't work at for Blizzard.
---
Yeah it's happened in the private server scene as well, once you create your first character you just get attached and don't want to move realms. The only way it will work if they reduce layers and implement long queues to make people switch and offer free transfers temporary.
---
Carrion birds are far better as they have more armor and are tankier plus they have the ability to learn Claw unlike a Bat who has no proper focus dump. This will make up for the stat modifiers in damage, this is also why Owls and Carrion Birds are much better than Bats.
---
If your only worried about dungeons you have NOTHING to worry about. Everything people say regarding druid deficincies only really become apparent on progression raiding. 
---
For the res issue, you can roll engineering adn get goblin cables to give yourself another possible res. Always use cables first, if they fail, then rebirth. This doesnt help a ton, so dont change your prof choice for it. 
---
If you have a priest or a shaman in the group, this is a non issue. They res, and if they are dead, you res them, they res everyone else. Warlock SS them, not you. I usually made my dungeon groups myself, and as a result, I could always ensure there was a priest or shaman DPSing for that res gap. Even without this, or without the cables, most of the time the single res isnt even used. Also, people grouping with a druid know you can res, they will walk back right away and for the most part, be ok with it.
---
I have never had any issues getting people to group when I have been feral druid tank. Same thing being restro for that matter. Really I have only ever run into issues when getting raid spots. Filling the last 2 or 3 spots in a raid its pretty easy to just fill an available spot as druid, but getting a dedicated reserved spot for a reserved spec other than restro is the hard part, and this isnt that hard, just harder than a pure class.
---
Most people are not pretentious min/max assholes. But those types of people tend to be in greater numbers around forums, even higher concentraion around forums for games that havent even been released yet. Take all the "Cannot, Should not, Will nots" that you hear about druids, shamans, hunters, etc with a HUGE grain of salt. Think of those statements as "In a perfectly min.maxed senario where all other things are the same and everyone try hards 100% without fail, while it still will work, brining another class other than a druid will save us a margina 5% on ability". 
---
The reality is, that the difficiencies that druids have are made to seem greater by the number crunchers. I have never been in a raid group that didnt have at least 3 or 4 druids. thats 10% of the raid group, and druids tend to make up 10% of the class distribution.  It is proportionally the same difficulty to get a spot as druid, as it is any other class, the hard part is peoples stigmas. 
---
For everyone, not just druids: Most players will not be in a guild going for world first, region first, or even realm first. If you do not see yourself wanting to be in bleeding edge hard core progression guild(IE 99% of us), than I wouldn't even be asking these questoins regarding druids, or any other class. Every glass is fine, some classes may be marginally better than others in certain situations, but the beauty of classic, is class variability. Dungeons and raids do NOT require the group composition to be perfectly min/maxed. While classes may not be balanced, encounters are balanced to the unoptimized group compositions.
---
Damn, guess I won‚Äôt be hiding helm. Really bummed they didn‚Äôt bake this in as a toggle feature.
---
They host their servers in massive data centers now days. If the population is out of control, spinning up a new server is a trivial thing for them to do. It's not like they need to order new physical servers and wait for them to be delivered/installed/configured.
---
When me president, they see.
---
PvP servers are pvp against anyone at any time. Faction does not matter. 
---
Normal servers allow PvP against other factions should you cross paths.
---
Not sure why my comment deserved a downvote. I was just curious about the name of the realm I'll be playing on.
---
I didn't see the region indicated anywhere. Not everyone is from the same region guys.
---
Poor guy grew out of his pants and boots.
---
#GrobMob
---
I get it, a comment not directed at you resonated with how you view yourself and offended you.
---
People only cared about that until they found something they don't care about. :p
---
The Blasted Lands red is notoriously terribly on the eyes as well
---
Honest question: why do people not like him?
---
no matter what as a a druid you will be in a raid because you will be the secondary healer. Battle Ress, HoT, Innervate. Druids are more about the utility you bring to the group. If the boss summons a bunch of mobs you can off tank them and have a mage aoe them away while the rest focus the boss still. And this is just PVE, pvp is a whole nother ball game
---
I was expecting less then this.
---
ye, other screen is 60 hz, Ill try your solution, thanks
---
You can reserve your character name on 3 servers for classic.
---
Just don't eat like a pig.
---
They used to but not anymore.
---
They have to manually flag themselves for PvP.  Otherwise you just see them and can't attack.  It's mainly for people who don't want to bother with ganks and world PvP.
---
All them cheeseburgers from the Battlegroup Burger down the road.
---
/r/Ateish
---
i wouldn't get too bent out of shape over the server count, sure...it looks like an underestimation but they can always add more, and no...it is nowhere near 100% "kill" if there are not enough
---

---
It certainly does not seem like they have analytic data and at this point they are just fucking guessing lol.
---
&gt;consider that 70% of that sample say they played vanilla as their first game. That is not exactly a wholly representative survey is it.
---
Why not? We're looking at who is staying till phase 2 since pre phase 2 with layering it doesn't matter. Surely people who are dedicated enough to answer a poll like this is going to continue playing.
---
How? How many people do you be expecting to play Classic WoW lol
---
Exactly what CST players will have to do. I'm EST so w/e
---
Hm alright, thanks for the reply and info, appreciate it
---
Ask and you shall receive. . .
---
Normal is pve, meaning there's no open world pvp unless you flag yourself for pvp. Pvp means you are always flagged for pvp in the open world. RP is pve where roleplaying is encouraged and rp-pvp is pvp where roleplaying is encouraged
---
I was expecting more. They‚Äôre gonna be making new servers real soon. Can just 5 pvp servers in na handle that load?
---
You only flag if you go into the other faction's own zone (like their main town), or if you type /pvp and toggle it on, or if you attack someone toggled on, or if you attack an NPC with a faction crest on their name plate (symbol of horde/alliance), or probably something else I've forgotten.
---
Is it a coordinated thing your monotoring?
---
Invite plz
---
Where my Pagle fishers at?
---
haha I saw that
---
Cant wait to go Rp pvp, less spergs there, and easier to report the spergs who do get there and act like spergs.
---
Well it's actually a pretty good method to rank at 59 (it even was nerfed on the said server). I don't think alot will wait at 59 until phase 3 to rank tho. But it could be a good idea if one of the ranker decide to reroll and rank on another toon.
---
Luckily I'm a bit too far south for those, but visiting parents in New England for the holidays might be my demise.
---
There's a saying that my guild leader used to say, "success is a journey, not a destination." That's so true when it comes to this game. Logging in and getting welfare epics in BFA just from doing chores isn't nearly as satisfying as the long boring slog that is classic. The time investment makes it feel rewarding.
---
Welcome to what private server users have been dealing with for over a decade now.
---
I'm hoping rppvp will be better too.
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking... streamer servers alone are going to put a decent load on servers alone I would imagine.
---
be glad we got an RP *and* a RP-PvP server.
---
I think the playerbase is overestimating how many people are going to stick around in classic after the first 3 months.
---
I‚Äôm at work so I don‚Äôt want to spend a ton of time on this, just something I threw together quickly for my guild. But when I get home I‚Äôll add the rest of the servers so check back tonight.
---
They were basically just announced, give it some time.
---
Another Chicken Little.
---
lol see you at launch!
---
Every streamer will be on Mankrik or Herod 100%
---
Correct
---
Read the TLDR. That is wrong.  Thus, people downvote, because it is wrong.  If people read the first sentence and it is wrong, they are most likely not going to bother reading the rest of the post.
---
why pick it up yourself?  you can just rent out a guild mate's non producing profession for a few minutes to craft your shit, while you are making tons of silver from ores, minerals, or arcanite xmutes.
---
LOL
---
Sells out, makes drawn out videos for ad money, pretends like he knows a lot about the game(this is the biggest one) but is actually a noob, lots of false information or miss conceptions, made false leaks in the past for attention, and ofc he's a streamer and everyone here hates streamers.
---
what a surprise
---
Far from it. I do agree with you though that one of the English servers should have been Spanish and/or Italian so you have all the major languages represented.
---
all good! I'll just do my research then. I only came back to tithe myself over on retail before classic hits. so i might as well use that time to farm for game time
---
Came back to say ‚Äútold ya so‚Äù 3 Us-pvp servers for each region hahah
---
you go Wife, i'll go Husband
---
Gonna avoid streamer servers like Tips Out avoids going to jail for fraud.

Faction imbalance sucks and my guild is going to be horde.
---
I'd be friends with him. Sounds like a cool guy to me. You on the other hand...
---
You judge me as a rude person because Ive been semi rude to you? really? Yeah this surely shows everything about how I am as a person in general..
---
Im actually dropping my jaw on how insanely thick you are... You are literally incapable of taking in information.. I just fucking explained to you that people will NOT NEED THE LOW LEVEL MATS FOR ENCHANTING THEIR LVL 60 GEAR..They will need it to level enchanting.. and yet you keep saying I said they will need it for their lvl 60 gear.. I cant belive it is possible to be this dense..
---
I dont even know what I can do to make a master of the english language like yourself understand very very basic written english.. It is right there on your screen to read and understand and yet you still dont understand it..
---
Weird subreddit to be on then...
---
Them deliberating means they are just waiting for Asmongold to tell them what server to roll on.
---
Staysafe just tweeted that they will for sure NOT be playing on Fairbanks or Thalnos so if you‚Äôre worried just reserve a name on one of those two.
---
It will leak.
---
No way streamers keep it a secret until that date.
---
I‚Äôll go Thex
---
I hope you don't try and use that name
---
25 realms.  
---
If we say the goal is at 4 months to have 4k concurrent players that's about 20k players per realm, so 500,000 players.  
---
If we say layering accounts for x4 realm size at launch that would be 2.0 million players at launch, betting only 1/4 will be playing long term.
---
My whole life I‚Äôve never even once played wow. I kinda want to try this but paying 90 dollars plus 15-20 a month, every month is just kinda not worth it...
---
It'll mostly be PvP servers. Or Mankrik for memes. But most streamers are overwhelmingly going to be concentrated on PvP servers.
---
except it would involve another round of testing, even the slightest model changes can expose unknown holes and choke points in the terrain.
---
Fine if they want to add a toggle later, but definately not at this point.
---
Blizzard is walking on eggshells with classic as it is. One wrong move (in addition to the many they have already made) will result in people quitting because the isn‚Äôt what they asked for. With the amount of servers they have all the experienced players will go back to Pservers and the inexperienced back to retail. And classic will be dead.
---
Agreed, Resto was just the example here. However if he was feral and wanted feral gear but was healing the dungeon, my comment still applies: communicate your main (feral) _especially_ if it contradicts your current role and be consistent
---
An upgrade is an upgrade. Put on that dress
---
yo im stealing you idea for a pencil holder
---
I've played on AUS servers from NA and it was fine.
---
Not really. I play wow on days when I get the chance. And I'm actually sitting here waiting for a meeting to start so I got free time. But streamers are losers who need to get a real job.
---
I wish they wouldn't roll on Herod. The name Herod just seems perfect to set it up as the next "Tichondrius/BG9" for the PVP focused server... too bad it's going to be the streamer server probably. Sucks.
---
I'm right there with you, but them getting early reservation *might* mean that those of us that would like to avoid streamer fan-clubs get a heads up on which realms we should avoid.
---
I mean when they remove layers in phase 2 lol
---
One video does not absolve him of a bunch of stupid ones.
---
Mining/Herbalism is not really doable on server launch. You will never find a single node. The smart play would be going skinning/leatherworking for now and change to whatever you want when things get less crazy.
---
It will be fine probs. 2 months in the servers will have dwindled to a stable number.
---
Agree, I genuinely hate that I have to actively monitor which server these idiots will be on just so my gameplay isn't ruined by kids running around sucking them off wherever they go.
---
Most of the people following them around are just trying to get attention. Streamers chat is always just spam of stupid shit. "look at me look at me"
---
you can just download the file and open from file on wallpaper engine, doesn't need to be posted on there.

yea helps me too being in Saint Louis. I've seen alot of talk about them being in Chicago and a guy ping tested out of LA and he said it seemed reasonable.
---
From the forums, it looks like the Spaniards are leaning towards Golemagg as their unofficial server.
---
EXACTLY. And that is ALL streamers do.
---
Oh well.  I'll have some fun out of it before it dies.
---
What are people using to judge if a streamer is actually going to affect server economy?  
---
I'd say the only one you gotta worry about is Asmon, because he does group-events. Not everyone's viewerbase is exactly like Asmon's.   
---
Other than that, saying "streamer servers" just sounds like a fucking joke lmao. A guy with 100 viewers is not going to affect the server.
---
I was in Tanaris when it happened, word sure traveled fast.
---
If you don't count the entire EU and Asia regions.
---
During the stresstest a random player gave me a lvl 5, 7dps 2h axe. I was the luckiest man alive.
---
I played for around 3h, communicated with several people, invited everyone for quests. They thanked me, i thanked them. It was a very heartly experience.
---
Some retail players didn't react to my invites, when they killed named questmobs. Afterwards they excused themselves and showed really nice behavior, even with language barriers.
---
Ahhh, leveling experience is mostly the same. The only difference is the faction specific cities / zones/ quest hubs. It definately sounds like you like Horde specific things more. 
---
Also, horde has RFC, ally has Stocks. I think EVERYONE will agree RFC is a superior dungeon than stocks. Nothing stopping you from running the other, its just much harder to get groups for the other factions dungeons, but come on, we all know being able to start dungeoning SOOO much earlier is better, also that RFC is 10x the dungeon than stocks is. 
---
once your past 30, for the most part, leveling is the same. 
---
I like ally better because I like the 1-2-3 elwynne, westfall, redridge soooo much that it trumps horde for me. I also love stormwind. IF is meh for me. barrens is fun, and org and RFC is good, but other than that, i dont like any other horde specific zone. 
---
As horde, no reason you cant come to RR and have some pvp fun ;)
---
meanwhile in phase 2 and onwards: 5000 guilds fight over a world boss, and the servers goes down because the amount of players in 1 area.

Man I seriously cannot stop reading that server name as white man. Holy shit it's getting hilarious.

---
The retail team has no idea what actually makes the classic philosophy work. So even if Classic convinces them that it does work, they wouldn't know what to do with that information.
---
Both are realm names (at least in EU) on the main game, though. They said they wouldn't re-use names.
---
amateurs... just go once a week during reset
---
Of course we can't link it, because it's internal data. They know the exact populations of the PvE and PvP realms on each stress test and throughout the Beta. Meanwhile, the data collected on this subreddit is very biased towards people who have been waiting for a long time and want the "genuine" Classic PvP experience. They know better than we do what the PvE/PvP split is.
---
I bet they‚Äôll play on herod
---
Entertainment is a real industry though.
---
&gt;and they probably aren't adding more servers so...
---
Based on?
---
Throughout the layering discussion they've talked about being ready on launch to address demand, including creating new servers if needed.
---
From what I understand there won't be any final decisions made before Sunday/Monday.
---
Run of the mill Groblin here
---
Who is "We"?
---
I hate it. 
---
FTH
---
see you at launch!
---
inb4 they add "paid" transfers to "new" servers before P2
---
We need more english pvp servers!
---
I'm noticing that too. When I played vanilla way back when I went alliance, and really wanted to change up the experience this time around, that's why I selected horde. Wondering how many people are thinking the same
---
Remember kids ..if you just throw up an occaisional' ' Loktar Ogra'  'ishnu alah' or ' By the light'! in General chat , that RP PVP server is a PVP server too.

Which makes it a really great idea.  Why would I care if they get their name before I get mine anyway?  It's just a silly thing to complain about.

Oh well, ya win some, ya lose some. You could always roll the dice and level on there. There's like a 50/50 chance they don't choose it.

Someone made /r/BloodsailBuccaneers for the only RP server announced so far, be awesome to see that sub get active also be a great way to meet people and find guilds.

Which one?

?? What realms had 12k, do you mean nost? One server, that was international?
---
I am 90% positive streamers will be on Herod.  Why?  Most of them, especially our boy MadSeason, use his armor to trigger them nostalgia feels in their audience.  They won't pass up the opportunity to play there.
---
If popularity rises for the game, expect new servers and possibly in new regions. It's been BLATANTLY clear that Blizzard has had minimal budget to get Classic going. They have caved to the minimal amount of player demands possible so expect a lot of post launch additions only if the game is a great success.
---
TLDR: Chill.
---
You're evidently missing the point of the whole dynamic spawning discussion. People have long argued that dynamic spawning is harmful to the economy of a server, and explicitly mentioned it as one of the modern features that is harmful to the game as a whole.
---
Therefore, there is a big difference between "dynamic spawning [namely via thresholds like in actual vanilla] confirmed" and "dynamic spawning [like modern retail] confirmed. This thread title misses about as much context as "food is dangerous to eat".
---
Yes, you vendor the greens/blues because the vendor price is worth more than the disenchanting mats on a fresh server. 
---
If you start 6 months late, leveling with Enchanting has more value. That's when you can sell low level Enchanting mats to all of those Druids who hit 60 before worrying about Enchanting :)
---
The internet back bone is not as strong through UTAH NEVEDA NEW MEXICO to get to LA.... if you live in texas up through the midwest go East coast (chicago data center)

I don't care either, but it's accurate to 1.12 and costs nothing to make the change for those as want it.

Most every server caters to EST raid regardless of where it is...

Finding late night PST guilds is so effing rare.

It's pretty much exactly what I predicted. I was thinking pvp/pve for each of the EU languages and then either 4 or 6 english servers. and then even amount across regions.

---
No they don't. They want changes. They should be banned.
---
I think after a month it wont matter. After these kids realize all they're doing is griding, the fact they have to pay every month just to stay active, plus the fact layering will make it hit or miss if they can even see the streamer will keep the streamer fanboys to manageable levels. The streamers will eventually move on to other games and we'll be fine. I also have no idea how dedicated streamers are and could be totally wrong, also no idea how layering actually works but it sounds like it could help ward off the fanboys.

Are you referring to your heals on others or self heals? FCT should show the heals done to you and on yourself, but the heals on other players will not show and require an addon.

Thanks for the heads up on this! I couldn't take part in the stress test and was hoping someone would post some info regarding this.
---
I'm playing undead and plan on investing a fair bit of time on launch so  we'll find out if the cloth grind is worth it.
---
One of the main things I would hate about the streamer servers is much more significant the twitch chat memes and shit will be there.
---
I did it too back in the day, might even be in early BC. I clearly remember we had 7 who wanted to do it so we made a raid party and had our fun.
---
I know what the names mean, I just dont know why they matter to people. They could be server 1, 2, 3, etc and It would have no effect on how I play or view the game. I was on the forums looking at people shit their pants over the names of the servers and it seems really over dramatic to me is all.
---
Tips Out (albeit a small streamer) did mention in plural that some streamers will avoid RP realms to not ruin them. I do hope this is a common trend across most streamers.
---
Would streamers roll on a PvP server? Asking for griefing imo
---
Was looking for this comment haha.
---
I genuinely don't know which I wanna play on. 10 is very nice to look at, but it definitely doesn't have a Classic feel to it.
---
&gt; make it a Chicago server with no timezone designation
---
How the fuck does that work?  You need a server time...
---
As someone who won't sub early just to reserve a name: cool story
---
You clearly have issues. Have a nice day.
---
Not really.  Like he said, I'm pretty sure everyone subscribed to this sub is going to join, and then many more.  Yes, there will be drop off after launch, but how much?  
---
Let's say 300k join, spread evenly that would be 23k per server, but we know some servers are going to be way more populated.  Those servers could easily reach 50k at launch.  Can the layering system even handle that?  
---
I honestly think Blizzard is underestimating here and this could be a disaster launch.  They did not stress test enough or let enough people into the beta to know the real demand they have here.
---
I have this sinking feeling it's gonna be mostly horde tho...
---
Sorry, we merged 2 dead realms and you were having the same name as another player. You will have change name.

How is that better?

Bye POG bitch.
---
Thalnos it is bois.
---
What makes you say that?
---
I will now
---
&gt; There is a pattern with sharding and now lack of servers. Are servers that expensive to have running?
---
They don't want underpopulated servers in three months leading to them turning off servers. Literally the worst thing that can happen to Classic is shutting off servers. Because there will be a news story on every major gaming website, and once you hit the "merging servers" phase of MMO life, you don't ever have a decent growth phase again.
---
This is a big part of why they refuse to do it for retail, too. They might link servers, but they'll never shut servers down. It's just not in the business philosophy.
---
So, they're anticipating a big rush, followed by an evening out of a (hopefully) steady state with sustainable server populations following that first big burst.
---
It's not about money, or trying to kneecap the release. It's about never having Polygon publish "Some Classic WoW Servers Shutting Down" on their front page.
---
There is a real chance the spanish try to "follow" the Uk to get a bigger population, thinks are gonna get hectic
---
yes, and yes. Everybody is aching for a good game.
---
Streamers being dicks? Who woulda thought?
---
And putting the only server in Chicago doesn't accomplish that in any way. You just screw over west-coast players instead of east-coast players.

Honestly never had a problem with the wow community outside of bg i'd say is one of the best online communitys i've ever dealt,but league and smash are the two community i've been a part of so everything seems like the nicest people ever in comparison.
---
Boring sounds like a huge con to me
---
This is the wrong mentality.  Screw the streamers herod is better pvp name i'm rolling there.  If they show up I will just gank them until they cry.
---
Not yet, they are just stating that so far the top twitch streamers are not going to be on those two.
---
If I were them, I'd do it just to spite all the people complaining.
---
Seriously, the amount of vitriol and entitlement I've seen coming from our own side is just plain nauseating.
---
It's about reserving your name on the server they play on if you plan on playing with them mate
---
Nice having only one server to choose from. Here's hoping it fills out evenly.
---
... got me there
---
Sorry, I meant Discord.
---
Just reserve two streamer names and then reserve your name. They won't pick a server where their names are pre-sniped.
---
&gt; server Mankrik?
---
Is that on the list? I can't seem to find it...
---
You are forgetting that it's not farming Slaghides or Atal'ai that's hard, it's specifically Of The Monkey suffix that's hard. You will be able to get a pair of Slaghides or Atal'ai pretty easily in terms of time investment, the most important stat on them is just the armor. 
---
&gt; Roll on up to any decent guild and tell them you can't be bothered to go for your Slaghides because they're too much of a chore and they'd have every right and reason to laugh at you. If you can't be bothered to put the effort forth in that scenario, where else are you going to slack in the future? 
---
Yeah maybe in late Phase 1. Any decent guild will either: Have players on launch or Need Warm Bodies. If they have players, yeah of course you'll need to be the best applicant. This is the same for Rogue/Warrior who will also need to farm an insane amount in order to be Pre-Raid BiS, I fail to see how you are demonstrating that this somehow invalidates a Druid but doesn't for other classes. If a guild needs warm bodies and it's early, they aren't going to care about your gloves/shoulders being absolutely perfect.
---
&gt; Are you planning on never running groups with guildmates or friends that happen to need the same gear? "Nah man, I'm not going to run with you because I want this item for myself." Sounds like a miserable way to play the game. 
---
No I fully plan to run with my guildmates/friends. But again, this is a ridiculous point to make. You will be out of those groups quite a bit when farming, and if you are mostly in a guild group you would hope that you can form it to reduce competition in the group. Besides, if you were to help one guildmate get the gear you would hope they would do the same, removing the idea of competition on the gear slot that you are talking about.
---
&gt; You will spend more time farming MCPs over the course of vanilla as a Druid than you will getting Dal'rends or Ironfoe as a rogue/warrior in phase 1, so I don't understand your point. 
---
Gnomer doesn't require a full group to farm and has 0 competition. We are also speaking specifically about spending time in P1, so I don't get why it matters how much I have to farm consumes over the course of the game when we are discussing weapons only (MCP is a consume, let's not kid ourselves). Gnomer is also way less mind numbing then chain running ZF or BRD and way more consistent. 
---
&gt; But it isn't. We're examing BIS as a whole, not cherry picking the easy pieces based on your entirely arbitrary criteria you've invented with no other basis other than to make your argument correct. [Why don't you educate yourself on those "alternatives" you've selected](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSVcmgixKaP9LC-rrqS4D2rojIz48KwKA8QBmJloX1h7f8BkUloVuiw19eR2U5WvVT4InYgnPunUo49/pubhtml#) and see just how much worse they really are. Bloodthirst is a 50% increase in survivability over Warbear, and a 300% increase in threat. Slaghides are a 100% increase over Devilsaur Gauntlets in survivability, and without the set bonus a negligible decrease in threat. Truestrikes have almost literally zero mitigation stats and are massively outclassed by Atal'ai of the Monkey in any situation, even when your mob is first target (since you'll have MCP threat in that case). 
---
I'm familiar with Taladril's list lol, dunno why you would think I wouldn't be. I find it rich that you accuse me of "Cherry picking" easy pieces, when you just cherry picked the stats for your argument. Slaghide being a 100% increase sounds huge, except when you consider this is 1 slot out of 14, and not even a strong slot for stats. It amounts to \~30 value points off, which is really not as big a deal, but looks huge when you say 100% increase or 300% increase (Which isn't even true, 55/88 is not 50%). Breastplate is the only one that offers a large stat increase that will be noticeable, but is completely purchasable. You lose \~60 value points with my alternatives, and this is again not considering that you could easily get workable suffix Slaghides/Atal'ai and not be down anywhere near as many points.
---
Your bear tank isn't going to die solely because his gloves/shoulders weren't perfect suffix. Your DPS is going to be massively different as a Rogue/Warrior if you don't have Ironfoe/Dal Rends. Bears have a much easier time gearing for raid period. You can argue about specific suffixes all you want, but end of the day you can get a decent suffix without that much work. Edgemasters/Iron Foe/Dal Rends/Felstriker/Sunrazor are all WAY harder to get than just a pair of Slaghides/Atal'ai.

Hell yeah mate, looking forward to doing SFK for his robes and seeing them drop at level 29, run #113

Pets tend to hang around mobs you've recently killed for a couple of seconds for some reason, but actual attack and follow commands are way snappier, almost no delay.

Defensive mode is broken, best at this point to keep pet on passive and just control it via macros (though that was the preferred method anyway).

That's all I've really been able to test but I'll try and stay on til the servers close this evening and test more.

I count four criteria.

Hey guys - we wanted to give you guys a few 100% safe realms to avoid the streamer server as we're not 100% certain where we're playing atm. See you all in Classic! (or not, lol)

3k was the max in vanilla and the devs literally said they will recreate that. Just because private servers do 8-10k doesn't mean anything.

Hope so :p i guess i gotta go extra hard in the weekends!

You know that a lot of streamers play on Tichondrious, right ?

It's cute that Tips considers himself a streamer that people want to avoid.
---
Tips might be playing the long con.
---
Why? That didn't happen with Vanilla so no reason to believe it will happen with Classic.
---
they've been tweeting a lot, check frontpage. Seems Herod is the likely choice since it's east coast pvp and cool name.
---
I think it's viable on undead, especially if you have a few guildies / friends who can funnel you a little cloth.
---
In Durotar nobody organically gets a reasonable amount of cloth, it only drops in a single quest hub that has 2 quests in it. So it's a no go for me unfortunately.

Some food can be dangerous to eat.  Also dynamic respawns are confirmed.  I'm not missing the point, I'm just point out that by trying to explain what's going on you've gone too far and misrepresented the actual game condition.  The point is that dynamic respawns are confirmed.  And your point is that it's not what you might think when you hear the word dynamic respawns.  And it would have been fine if you said that but instead you said it's not dynamic respawns which is patently false.

I wish it was as easy as that man... and you're just going to be creating content for them while they get paid on your efforts... I want a vanilla experience where I can carve a name for myself and my enemies, where I can farm and expect maybe by rivals to show up from time to time but not a hoard of people closing the zone down until their little event is over....every weekend....

When they added new servers in the past they provided free character transfers to players on very full servers. Not everyone will do it but some certainly will which will help balance things out very quickly. People tend to only look at the first 2 months which is absurd, I want to have things stable down the road in a year or two. If they really have too many players online by the time phase 2 comes around, they will most definitely go with the route of new realms and free transfers which will resolve that issue very quickly. No way they intentionally make players quit by not giving out the content, that'd be an awful buisness decision lol

Esfand, Asmon, Soda will probably  be on the same server. Asmon is and Soda will make their own guilds, so they are going to be telling hundreds of people.

Game at release:
---
1. Create minimal realm list to ensure those servers fill.
---
2. Release NEW realms on demand.
---
So, if Classic is a great success and initial server capacity is exceeded, expect new realms to be dynamically added. It's been this way in nearly every mmorpg launch. Use dat brain.
---
Thank you. This is the most informative help I've received. The only remaining question is how much do pets hang out on dead targets in pvp.

There wasn‚Äôt an option for discussion. You made a statement based on zero data, only feelies. Can‚Äôt really discuss that.

If you really want to play on an RP-PVP server, Grobb, but if you care about minimizing latency, one of the east coast pvp servers and try to find a RP guild.

PvE servers were more popular in vanilla and will still be popular in Classic (which is why there are 4 of them). I have no idea how "pve server low pop" became a thing because it was never true in any part of WoW's history
---
I'm looking at going Alliance on Faerlina. Would be nice to see it become the community CST server.
---
Still deciding !

The guild discord for RP PVP are almost all quoting EST times.

Add Europe Realms please

Also total bullshit. LoL servers are in Chicago. West coasters live at 75-90 ping to it. It is NOT the most neutral. It is the same amount of not neutral.
---
They hosted it in a PVP zone, posted it to the guild forums, and asked people in the post not to crash. It‚Äôs like it was their first day on the Internet or something. With conditions like that, of course someone is going to show up to ruin it.
---
Yeah, at this point the difference in server lag as long as you're in NA should be pretty minimal and being on the same prime time sounds way more beneficial.
---
one of the things I like about wow is that it was fair, if you want something you have to do the same no matter who you are, this will be unfair for the people that will lose their names in the name resevation process, my wish for a cool name is not less important than theirs
---
They block the WoW forums and not reddit? Classic IT.
---
You beat me to it
---
I suppose as long as layering lasts, it doesn't really matter how many players are on a server. I've always suspected that they would launch with a small number of realms that were only meant to last until the end of phase 1, and then they open the permanent non-layered realms for phase 2 and everyone migrates to their server of choice. By that point, they'll actually know how many long-term players there are and how many realms they need.

The 2nd tweet included in my own post I think was due to backlash from other streamers to his tweet. Check this clip from Ziqo's stream around the same time https://clips.twitch.tv/CrowdedDifferentIguanaImGlitch

If you are killing something in cat form it will be faster to stay cat form than shift out then travel shift out then cat again, unless you are about to leave an area. Id argue feline swiftness is the best leveling talent for any class.

I quit in 2009, recovered my account because it was before it was connected to Bnet. And mine got hacked or something and  permanently banned. I fought with blizzard and they said they couldn 't (wouldn't) reverse the ban because they didnt suspect hacking or some shit. So basically i lost my main that i had well over a 1.5 years of /played on. Really bummed me out. But still excited for classic to drop and recreate him.
---
Exactly. Reacting to the launch population and adding a whole bunch of servers leaves us with ghost town servers once the launch hype dies down. I'd much rather wait in a queue or deal with some crowded starter zones temporarily than have serious underpopulation issues on some servers in the long term.
---
Haha, okay. I wonder if those free 7-day trials I got back in the day are still valid!
---
That's actually the cringiest thing I've seen in awhile, congrats.
---
Blizzard will 99% lock their names for them if they go so far as to request that from them.
---
The fact that you guys are going that far to try and force streamers away is as ape as it gets. Even if they don't get their name reserved and you monkeys take them they'll simply change the name to something else and continue on with their lives.
---
So no RP-PvP servers for Eastern?  Damn..
---
Speak for yourself. Most people do not want to play at 80-100 ping if they can help it. If nobody cared about ping then server designation wouldn't matter one bit. Just make an east coast guild and raid at east coast times. Problem solved.
---
That didn't happen with Vanilla because they had no launch experience and it was quite new overall . It's common practice for game launch to have back up server and they also said on their forum that they had server ready in case.
---
Also, blizzard had a fair amount of bad launch and a fair amount of good launch, I think they have some decent knowledge about it.
---
One last point, I am pretty sure they are a bit underestimating the amount but they have better knowledge of their server infrastructure, they know how many people subscribe to beta, play the beta, subscribe to WoW, google for shit about classic.
---
So yeah, that can go either way but on the good point, I think it's better they open their server one by one and have full and lively sever than mid population (especially for classic )
---
And yes, that's my 2 cents because I can be as wrong too
---
While I can't wait to pwn all you horde scum, today we are all Grobby Bois
---
Yeah, on retail... with sharding and the way retail is now, why would that matter? Do you not see how ignorant your comparison is already? Your point matters not. I played Tichondrius all throughout vanilla and streamers would've wrecked how great the community was then too.
---
I guarantee Tichondrius wouldn't have server "legends" like Ponie's precum, Steelballa, Retrojabba, Cireth etc. if all the lore about the server was centered around the streamer and his drama... the little man ceases to matter when overran with THIS: https://streamable.com/md9uu

How the hell am I supposed to roll on a realm that isn't called Herod?

dude there's like max 4 streamers on eu overall. there's forsen, preach, heel and then probably some method people.
---
Oh they're DEFINITELY going on those two servers, they're just fucking with the community. At least they'll largely stay on the PvP realms.
---
Actually I think that a lot of people will find the class that they've chosen not satisfying and wanting to reroll after few weeks.
---
That said,  they probably will prefer the same server as not to lose some gold they already got.
---
&gt; official
---
I don't think that word means what you think it means.

Server designation matters because people need to be with players that are online at the same time they are. It's not a hard concept to grasp.

So just pulled out of your ass, gotcha.
---
On a serious note, a lot of "former WoW players" won't play on Classic either. It's really hard to guess these numbers. So my money is on the people with the most real numbers and the most information (Blizzard). But maybe they're planning to increase the number of servers "due to great success" - which is not a bad marketing move tbh. Always better than to close servers "due to lack of interest...".
---
I mostly agree with you. I personally wouldn't run dungeons with more than 5 most of the time, however I can see a few situations I would. The main situation is if you have a group of friends all on discord who are leveling together and go to do a dungeon but they don't have the right unit comp. Say you have 5 friends and no tank so you add a 6th. Or if you are just missing a mail wearing class and you're in a big guild so you ask in guild chat if anyone who wears mail wants to tag along and get uncontested loot.
---
I suppose you might want things like 4 mages and 2 healers for an AOE farming of SM.
---
The problem they and us have is that they only have until to release to fix this. They offer free migrations after people have had the chance to level and nobody will want to reroll. 2 PvP for most of Europe is a flat out retarded decision.

yeah, which is really pissing off the speed leveling community, anyone who accidentally rolls on asmon or sodas server is going to quit the race pretty early

The last character I rolled on a private server was a Feral Druid (14/32/5). I usually ended up tanking, but when i wasn't tanking, I was usually healing. Not once did anyone ever complain about my healing, and I wasn't even Resto. Outside of raids, people don't care what class you're playing or how you're specced as long as you perform well in the roll you're currently filling.
---
A developer with a long history of fucking up shit exactly like this. 
---
See: almost all their releases besides the last few where everyone had already quit.
---
They won‚Äôt be there till phase two when it‚Äôs gonna be removed
---
Ok, see you on launch.
---
Considering the amount of the servers I am pretty sure you cannot avoid them.
---
I might be wrong though, who knows.
---
Yup, and they will probably realize this and release more servers after the initial launch and people that already have their guilds playing on these first batch of servers won‚Äôt want to reroll
---
People say that. It isnt you wont find ANY. its that you will outlevel your profession unless you stop leveling and focus on it entirely a few times. Like mining getting from tin/bronze to iron will result in a few hours grinding it with little success.
---
Damn noo don't steal the best Pacific name server!! Lol
---
Please god don‚Äôt go on whitemane
---
If populations are too high and they put out more servers in phase 2 then layering was pointless and people will be begging for sever transfers
---
Why do people keep acting like server time designation matters in the slightest??!?
---
Nothing is stopping people from creating an east coast guild or west coast guild on any server. The ONLY issue here is ping time. East coasters are getting screwed by this because of PING TIMES ONLY. That is a real problem. But west coasters would be equally screwed if the only server was in Chicago.
---
The answer is NOT to make 1 server in any particular location. The answer is to make 2 servers! How are people failing to grasp this.
---
The designated server time doesn't matter at all! Zero. Nada. Zilch. Nothing. You can establish a guild and raid at any time you want, and the designated server time has no effect on that. The ONLY relevant thing server location affects is ping. That's it.
---
People are high as fuck right now.
---
Are you a hardcore PVPer trying to reach high ranks? If not the lag is barely noticeable. Just that the timezones will be off and might be awkward to you.
---
Streamers know this is their job so they know it would be ridiculous to avoid other streamers. The best thing they could do for themselves is consolidate onto one server if possible for collaborative purposes.
---
There shouldn't have to be a queue. With such a low number of realms, there can't possibly be a limited capacity. There were queues for the stress test probably because they were testing parameters, but there's no practical reason why layered servers would need queues aside from the literal launch moment when everybody in the whole world is trying to log in at the same exact time.
---
At launch yes.  But since Blizzard has said layering is temporary, having 11 servers with a stated goal of 3k per server still comes out to around 120k.
---
I would take what any of these streamers say with a grain of salt.
---
First, they could just be lying to misdirect people.
---
Second, they could easily change their mind as they talk among themselves and decide to go wherever.

Streamers are ruinning gaming , I dont want to roll on their server.
---
I may be mistaken, but I believe in initial posts Blizzard said they weren‚Äôt even going to have RPPvP servers at launch.  
---
Regardless of time zones, I think we should just be grateful.
---
What wrong moves have they made to be in the position of "walking on eggshells"? Sounds like you are conflating your own feelings a bit.
---
Actually they weren‚Äôt other than the ones that I posted the patch info for in the main post.
---
There‚Äôs video evidence from TBC to support this
---
&gt; And people's opinions should be judged on their own validity, and not whether or not they played in 2005-2006. 
---
Right, and "I don't care" has no validity whatsoever.  That is what this thread was initially addressing.
---
When it comes to reproducing Vanilla gameplay, opinions don't matter, evidence matters.  OP produced ample evidence that there is a discrepancy between Vanilla and Classic gameplay.  "I don't care" is an completely irrelevant response.

World of Warcraft Classic is a faithful recreation of the original WoW experience, as it was in 2006. Everything about the game‚Äîfrom combat mechanics and talent trees, to character models and zone layouts‚Äîhas been restored to realize a truly authentic experience.
---

---
This was just an RP funeral for an IRL guildmate but there is no respecting the line for quest mobs. It's take or be taken.
---
I'd assume more after watching OSRS and their playerbase
---
‚ÄúYA THINK IT‚ÄôS HONOR THAT‚ÄôS KEEPING THE PEACE?!‚Äù
---
Most of them are... why do you think they act so fake constantly. It's just for show.
---
These servers are going to be cancer.
---
&gt; around 500k. This would be 5 x Nostalrius
---
Lol, Nostalrius did not have 100k, it had 10k. It is not 5x Nost it is 50x Nost.
---
Yea, that was my immediate thought. I'm wondering if those servers won't be around at launch.
---
I remember him playing forsaken world and he was such a dick to everyone. Team Visa for the steal.
---
Contrary to popular belief, classic streamers actually care a lot about this game and its community &lt;3
---
As I'll play with a group of 4 or 5 my plans didn't change much. I thought we might skip some mobs because of the Spawns but when we figured out it's a bug this thought was gone already.
---
What we do for professions is basically everyone takes the gathering profs he intends to get for Endgame anyways and those who don't want Gathering (like me with Prot-Warri will go Smith + Engi) will take whatever is left (if something is left) and switch later.
---
Thalnos is the coolest name as far as the NA PvP names are concerned.
---
So happy I'm for carebear servers. Makes my life so much easier
---
For what its worth, the Scandinavians speak English... Far more so than the average Spaniard...
---
How exactly would they have fixed it? They gonna remove our ability to layer hop? I hardly think so m8, please do elaborate or provide some sources. Where did the devs state they expect a million players? Would love to read about that.   
---
Their best option would be to hit a balance between server count and player longevity. Layering is obviously first and foremost a cost cutting method.  
---
100 realms and 40% die? That would still leave 60, six times as much as we're getting xD I get you're point tho, certainly dead servers is something they need to take steps to avoid - but they also need to take steps to let classic have the sort of dynamic community experience where you meet a guy, happen to see him later and eventually make friends. Layering messes with that, as well as friends and guilds etc splitting up when transfer are up, not to mention the chaos when layers eventually - we hope anyways - go away.
---
I don‚Äôt have the evidence so you can obviously disregard this but I am sure that this was covered by blizzard when talking about some of the things that would be changed because of the intention. In fact as soon as I saw your post I was surprised it had so much traction because I was sure this had already been sorted. 
---
But now I am starting to doubt that based on this thread ha ha.
---
If you only ever cast R4 Healing Touch your mana bar will basically never go down. That's a waste of resources. You should dump your extra mana on HoTs, even in raids.
---
For the alliance!
---
Shitpost because it is obviously a troll post. They can add 10 servers in the first week if they need to. oh, and when you want to xfer with all your bros so you can be on the same server because a few of them were late to the party, Blizz gets those sweet xfer chargers. If anything it is all part of the plan.
---
Is a bit higher ping that big of a deal?
---
They have said there will be server transfers so worst case we can just transfer off their cesspool of a server
---

---
Are you and your friends autistic?

I was led to believe streamers only cared about hateclicks and money. 
---

---
And I'm pissed because the east coast should have a server for them too.
---
I'm literally advocating for Blizzard to help the east coast by giving them their own server and all I'm getting is morons yelling at me about being selfish. What the fuck is wrong with people?
---
Thanks a lot for this!
---
He is speaking for a group of streamers u dumbass
---
It could have been but I was fairly thorough trying to find the sources
---
Lets show them then. I actually hope the number of players exceed expectations. That's the closest this community will ever get to rubbing it in their faces after the "you think you do, but you don't" comment.
---
The APES guild are probably worth avoiding if you're Horde
---
Everyone I've seen is happy and thankful for that. But they are forcing the rest of the Classic playerbase to wait on them to announce their server. Streamers will affect everyone player on the server they choose. Every player needs to know where they are, so they can decide to play on that server or not. Until they announce which one it is, every guild, every group of friends, everyone else playing Classic has to wait for them. (Except the people who don't know what chaos they will cause and will be in for a surprise.)
---
&gt; Exactly.  
---
Stop being toxic.
---
Nice yea I hope I can get on after work still for another hour or two if that‚Äôs all. I really wish they would just extend it for the weekend this is such a tease. But no we didn‚Äôt kill hogger. By the time we got there we had like 10-15 people left that didn‚Äôt give up past duskwood lol but we fought a bunch of alliance near northshire after we would camp a quest spawn until they‚Äôd bring people to fight us a couple times. It was fun.
---
I think he's just meme:ing but I could be wrong.
---
Latency raid times generally west coast raids start at five if you were to play from EC and be on a WC server you‚Äôd be raiding three hours later this is a pretty big deal considering if raid starts at 5-6 and it‚Äôs three hours long your going to be finishing at 11-12 at night EC
---
Feeling old yet?
---
Personally I believe that the negative effects of over crowding eclipse the positive. 3k is more than enough
---
Yeah, get ready for 10h queues
---
Same for me. Gameplay made classic WoW great (that's what everyone here says and why the don't play retail) yet they're opposed to graphic updates lol. It makes no sense. TBC was trash -- we want vanilla, not TBC. They need to go improve on classic WoW and leave it at level 60. I feel like the TBC crowd is a very vocal minority or people who just didn't play classic and didnt get to experience TBC.
---
I honestly hope bliz puts it up to a vote. I vote for Classic+. This topic has been talked to death, though. But please, no TBC.
---
Keep that shit in twitch chat
---
With the massive queues on the PVP servers, Im likely gonna roll there instead, tbh. I dont mind adhering to the RP naming rules etc, even though I very rarely engage in it myself.
---
This assumes they won't get in early to reserve their names. I am certain blizz is going to give them early access to reservation to make sure they get the names they want.
---
Before he was known for gaming, he and his dad owned a company that did construction work for public projects in California called FTR International. That company had legal disputes filed against them on EVERY contract and used to send invoices for work that wasn't finished or not done at all.
---
One such attempt was for almost $1 million dollars of taxpayer money. Just straight up thievery but with legal obscurity so as to not be outright criminal. When the county board called him out on it and banned him and his company from ever holding contracts again, he threatened to sue the board members as individuals for "racism".
---
It eventually did go to court, he did try to play the race card, it became a long protracted legal battle that wasn't clear cut and initially was ruled in his favor, but on appeal, a judge told him to STFU and practically overnight, FTR International ceased to exist, forcing TipsOut into millions of personal debt.
---
Note: the only reason I'm not linking to proof is because the court records contain TipsOut's IRL name and even when a quick google search can produce the same results, doxxing someone on Reddit isn't cool or allowed.
---
You're style is just great. Thanks for making it.
---
My personal preference doesn't matter. I'm solely responsible for making the most people happy with the server selection as possible. For me, the variance of picking the LA and Chicago is only 10 ping. I personally am not affected myself, but an east coast player has an option of 30 ping, or 70, which is a bit larger of a variance. I can respect them wanting to get the most out of the server they'll spend so much time on.
---
the smaller one probably want to avoid the big ones
---
Right? Literally the only good name.
---
Game chat becomes twitch chat ("lol, streamer x just did y" ad libitum), being ganked by hordes of fan following the streamer. This are the two main reasons that I have in mind right now
---
Yeah and I just saw further down some said something similar and you checked and couldn‚Äôt find it. And based on how much you put this into
---
This post I believe you. 
---
I‚Äôll have a look to, but I‚Äôm starting to think you are correct!
---
The beta was dead after a week. Same will be the case with Classic. That‚Äôs why they have layering for the initial rush and only a few servers for when it starts dying down.
---
I have seen multiple screenshots of lines for quests already. I mean it's so funny to me why people care to respect it.
---
Staysafe said here on reddit that whitemane was still on the table.
---
Looks like you never played on Chrushridge then...

---
Time zone won‚Äôt matter. You‚Äôll find EST raiders.
---
If they announced right away everyone would take there names
---
Yeah wanting to avoid streamer servers don't mean we hate them or don't watch them. I must say Soda lost all respect from me after that blacklist rant tho, sounded like some mad power hungry chinese social point stuff. Venruki seems to be the streamer who is most grounded in his sense of self and reality in spite of his popularity, the rest i would not want to play with.

so you are not a fan of rushing feline swiftness and then getting omen of clarity?  I would assume omen is like a 20% overall increase in leveling damage, since on napkin math it would double combo generators and add 1-2 points to your finisher for the fight it procs in.
---
I think your build is pretty much the standard template if they do not plan on going 21 resto to save a respec at 60 for HOTW with the mana benefits.  But I can't tell which level you pick each spell on classicdb.  Do you ever use https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com?

HIIIIGHLY doubtful

You could compromise with 50 servers instead of pretending 10 would be enough lmao
---
I have bitched about /r/wow having too many art posts however your artwork is amazing and brings back memories of the good ol' days. Please never stop
---
Yeah I was hoping for central servers to increase my chances of finding players near me. As I type that out I immediately realized how creepy that sounds.
---
Same as on all the other realms since they‚Äôre connected.
---
In terms of **1-55 5-man** dungeons, which means most of of the 5-man, avoidance/mitigation hardly matters if in the end bear gonna be overall bulkier and no warrior will have avoidance talents/itens during leveling, so warrior's avoidance will be low too anyway. Fear removal also isn't used that much is these stages. There are maybe 3 total bosses that can fear in the whole game?

His name is ButtPluggington yo.

You're getting irrationally upset at the idea of mirroring the current Retail server setup for RP-PvP servers.

Which will make the data pointless.
---
The beta is a beta. Most people do not like playing them.
---
Don't come to me with your stupid sharding excuse. Was there sharding in MoP when Reckful, Cdew, Venruki, Snutz, Sodah, Veev, Zilea and every other big pvper were streaming ? Or are you one of those people who think that Asmongold is the only streamer in existence ?
---
It would be smart and solve this problem but the fact they aren't announcing leads me to believe they are worried.  Stream snipers won't ignore them just because they waited until launch to say where they are playing.  It won't give them any headstart, all they have to do is watch what server they are on day 1 and get on it.  And if they try to hide the server people can just do a /who streamer name and figure it out.
---
It's stupid for them to wait unless it's about name reserve.

They can always make more with very little, if any, consequence, days or even hours into the actual launch. But the risk of launching with too many realms is real and the consequences there are damning.
---
Towelliee is going pve. But his fanbase isn't spergy so you won't have the same issues. Also his guild will be on the same server and they have been together since vanilla and are also great people.
---
Thalnos is going to be the massive non-streamer alternative it appears
---
The Retail RP-PvP servers are CST and it works out really well for them so I think the Classic RP-PvP server should be CST as well. It only makes sense.

"Herp derp. I want Classic exactly as it was. But I want to be the most popular player on the server because I game and record myself doing it. Also people give me free shit and I have multiple escorts everywhere."
---
Clearly they decided that the English realmlist would only need two PVP realms first. Then they're left with a dilemma, because they can't give France 0.22 of a PVP realm. So they get one. The fact that they're not proportional to population count isn't a maths failure in itself.
---
Not commenting either way on if 2 is too many/few because it really depends on how many players there are per layer and how hard the population drops off by phase 2.

---
Yes, a work computer for a defense contractor.  Unauthorized software pretty much earns you a background check and a termination letter lol.
---
Yeah, they only announced it in the last day or two.
---
It will only deter idiots from rolling there. The latency from connecting to LA from NY isn‚Äôt nearly what it is to do NY to Sweden/Russia where most speeches have been.
---
 150-250ms wasn‚Äôt unheard of in classic, possibly even common. 
---
Rp pvp being on W coast has no real retraction. Especially when you consider it‚Äôs the only one so people will organize raids there from Hawaii time to Eastern time.
---
Those are not options unless you are native to their respective localizations. I got two options.
---
Ayy, Server ping is gonna be real low living in Chicago for me.
---
Thank you!  I really enjoy ClassiCast and I appreciate everything you guys do for the community, thank you again for making the announcement so soon!  Enjoy Azeroth!!
---
And you're missing the point that we're taking about Phase 2 with regards to server population. You know, the phase where (allegedly) there won't be any more layering - which means that at such point, the entire realm, and the single 'layer' it has, needs to only have around 3k players. That's the problematic part, not how many layers there are initially or how much each one holds, initially.
---
Seems so so low. Maybe i'm just delusional, have people really moved on from mmo's? I never will.
---
The real missed opportunity was not naming at least one server Thex.
---
Why do you believe that? Classic existing is a testament that they‚Äôve accepted there are enough players to make it successful. If it is successful why couldn‚Äôt they develop more of the same style content? Everyone acts like it‚Äôs some great lost art form but it‚Äôs not. Keeping classic makes more financial sense than making classic more retail like or making retail classic like. The only thing that might be better for them financially would be releasing tbc and wotlk because of the low level of effort despite losing subscribers from doing it.
---
I agree with you entirely. They have listened way more than I expected, honestly. Layering, while not ideal, serves an important purpose. I would commend Blizz so far on classic. I have been very surprised.
---
It kinda was though right?  Just like choosing west vs east coast for servers that aren‚Äôt going to vanish on a whim.
---
It's hard for me to assume they'll all be on one realm. I feel like there might be a few different groups of them.
---
Yes, I saw that with the latest version and reverted back
---
So ruined, lmao. Sounds like snowflake talk. Those 300 people are going to turn into 3 people following the streamers and dying cause they aren't leveled and the rest will leave and contribute to the server population.
---
Eh I'd much prefer having my server merged if it gets underpopulated than deal with mega-overpopulation that layering brings. The merge happens once, as opposed to layering which happens persistently.
---
95% chance its Herod.
---
All the streamers talk and are coordinated with eachother, no maybe not ALL streamers, BUT there is a very large group that will be playing together and be claiming the server as an official "streamer server" and well never hear different &gt;.&gt;  
---
AT LEAST  
---
Esfand Asmon Staysafe Sodapoppin will be together 100%
---
Per StaySafe's twitter, they aren't rolling on Fairbanks or Thalnos, and most if not all of them are going PvP. So going on one of those two, or the normal or RP servers
---
Yes, lets avoid it like the plague.
---
Spanish, Italians and streamers.
---
Yes but then that just creates those new servers as DoA basically which sucks
---
Yeah I know, but not really the smartest idea at launch. Afterwards yeah do it all and enjoy it :)
---
*Cries in Indian*
---
Nost had over 100k population, BUT around 10k online all the time. Ideally we want to be 15-20k on each server so that there's always around 2k-5k online.
---
According to this announcement, blizzard expects there only to be around 25k in Europe who wants to play classic wow on a PvP realm, which is laughable.
---
And now you're the one arguing semantics. Can't we just agree that we misinterpreted each other instead of this pointless "I started this discussion saying you're wrong and am refuse to give in" thing.
---
r/absoluteunits
---
as one who doesn't speak swedish, I'm not that concerned about which server they, or the other scandinavian countries will pick, as most of them can speak english, and as good as all of them, can understand it.
---
that's pretty impressive, where did the stats get posted? That being said, that's not the 10 million people keep saying will be there on day 1.
---
that makes sense actually.
---
&gt; Esfand Asmon Staysafe Sodapoppin will be together 100%
---
I'm not doubting you, but how confident are we about this statement?
---
Heals on others, can you recommend an addon?

I really don't think server time matters all that much
---

---
They‚Äôre all going on the same server my dude.
---
People are setting up server discords in separate threads- is there any chance you guys could make a single sticky thread to bring more people to them and prevent duplicates?
---
Shamans are so powerful, their lightning changes players graphic settings.
---
&gt;or they have no plans on realistically removing layering
---
Of course. I think people are finally starting to realize this.
---
They announced it as couple days ago. I guess there was more interest than they expected.
---
It absolutely does.
---
If you're into WPVP at all, which I'd assume most people going PvP servers are, then having a giant mob of people that show up to every WPVP event because that's where the streamer is, wouldn't really be fun imo. Not to mention if a streamer decides to farm something, there will likely be a bunch of players helping them out in the same area making sure they can get all the loot from mobs/nodes.
---
I was Alliance on Twisting Nether before the AV rework/rebalance in vanilla, we ALWAYS lost, but atleast it took them 6 hours if not longer to take the win
---
I play OW constantly on fiber optic on both Eastern and Pacific. Eastern is about 60-70 ping, Pacific is closer to 130. It‚Äôs mind boggling that Blizzard has no east coast servers, considering NYC area is a hotspot for gaming.

Dude if there's 1 server the EST people will just make their own guilds and play together.  It's not a big deal
---
Not fully true. It's both.
---
Listened to the wrong people by recreating their own mechanics from 2006 (leeway) and solving the dead server problem (layering)
---
They listened to the right people
---
I got to around level 2 and half way to 3 with only exploring xp so pretty good if you ignore the massive amounts of deaths we had.
---
The ones that actually matter will have their names reserved beforehand by Blizz just like on the beta
---
hey guys just looking for a $4000 pc that can run wow classic
---
Turns out entertainers entertain for money. What a revelation!
---
apes are going NA
---
Exactly. Even if they add servers, these 11 will have layering until the day the servers are shut off for good.
---
They already said they won't be rolling Fairbanks or Thalnos.
---
But I saw people use it for the Beta, so there must be a working version

Kind of assumed it would play out like this. I doubt we will have the pop to maintain multiple servers after the initial hype.

really well done, would 100% put it on my desktop if my computer was not a glorified toaster

Not a ton, but mostly the server time matters. Many guilds/players on the East Coast won't roll on a Pacific server.

Yep. It'll definitely be PvP.

I played on a pve server in vanilla and the BGs were super competitive just like any PvP server.
---

They need to either way. WoW continues to have a smaller and smaller playerbase. A big part of that is because the game is so stale. Legion had some cool ideas, but pretty much everything about BFA was a huge bust.

QQ - I've read so many different opinions and asked the Druid discord and such about this. All I really want to do is play some Moonkin at 60. I've tested a bit on pservers and in dungeon gear it's not terrible, but not good either.

I don't know if I'll really have the hours at a time to do a lot of raiding or even dungeons at max level. Should I just roll a Mage or Hunter? Will life at 60 really be that bad?

It will deter some East Coast guilds and players. So it sort of is a big deal.
---
Honestly who knows, maybe it would even be a ton of fun for me to roll on the streamer server? I‚Äôm open to it. A lot of fuckery and dumb shit to be had with different tribes of streamerfolk. Streamer‚Äôs have armies at their command and it could create an interesting dynamic.
---
I agree with this. Although I kinda wish they'd do BC first before classic+.
---
But layering beyond the first zones would completely kill the community feel of the game.
---
You have 0 data to support your claims, whereas they have all the data from the stress tests and subscriber info. You saying millions will play holds no weight whatsoever, it‚Äôs a huge exaggeration. 
---
If they need more servers, they will add more servers. But, chances are a huge percentage will quit and it‚Äôll be fine.
---
I'm from Anchorage myself, and the guild im putting together is definitely going fairbanks. If you're looking for a late night raiding guild for that server let me know :)
---
..I was ok till I found out out one of the Russian server names translates as Chromie ..now I'm jealous!
---
He's been playing with all the big streamers on beta, so probably people like Sodapoppin, Sonydigital, Venruki, Cdew, probably Asmongold (although I've seen a couple people say he's considering PvE servers so not sure)
---
I would not be surprised if the group also had Soni and Payo EZ
---
I thought they did west coast to also grab in any Oceanic players that desperately wanted RPPVP.
---
I feel like the easiest way to avoid streamers is to play on PvE servers :/
---
It does trust me.
---
Ive played on an RP server on Live for years. I can count the amount of times Ive actually engaged in RP on one hand. I just like seeing the RPers, it brought life to the world.
---
I know RP-PvP servers are usually less serious RP by nature of being PvP (at least outside of major cities) - but I think the RP-PvP server will be my main now. And with the massive queues and Spanish invasion on the 2 PvP servers, its gonna be an easier sell for my friends to join me... I dont mind adhering to the RP naming convention etc.
---
Honestly I thought the names were pretty bad before having anything to complain about
---
That's good for everyone else. 
---
However... who is going to be Scarab Lord? LOL
---
Good thing they just announced what servers they won't be rolling on! It's the post you just commented on.
---
Don‚Äôt worry, no one actually died and the lady faked her death and made an ingame funeral to escape a creeper.
---
Are they? Most people I‚Äôve seen seem to think it looks pretty lame

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/co8lpt/i_thought_the_stress_test_was_over/). 
---
Literally my life
---
Every server is now streamer server! And also Thex server
---
I wanted a server were I didn't need to speak two languages, I can barely speak english.
---
Also, I played a lot of mmorpg with a subset of spanish players, and it becomes a closed community were people don't want to play with each other.
---
&gt; why do people in the comments say they dont care? the whole point of classic wow is a recreation of the way things worked in vanilla.
---
To a lot of people, this is not the point at all. I for one, could not care less, i just want to play a game and quite frankly, i have more faith in blizzard devs than to fanatical vanilla wow purists, some of whom base their opinions on more recent private server experiences rather than vanilla it self.
---
Some things just cannot be the same as they were 15years ago, so much have changed. Min maxing and the knowledge of the game are far beyond what it used to be.
---
If you do this you‚Äôre totally wasting your time. The line never moves, skip this quest it is not worth the xp, just grind mobs instead.
---
Lmao
---
ive heard he's going RP-PVP as theres planned GTA RP type events
---
Still super handy to have. 
---
Here is the  breakdown I use for travel times and distance between 30% (Cat form with talents) 40% (Travel form) or 60% (Mount). Feral Energy tick = 2 secs.
---
Running = 1.0 speed (7y/s)
---
2/2 Feline swiftness = 1.3 speed
---
Travel form = 1.4 speed
---
Mount = 1.6 + 3 seconds speed
---
Assuming the node you are traveling to is a non combat node, and you have no other speed enhancements except mount or travel form, then it is never faster to travel in cat form over travel form, and it is faster to travel in travel form over 60% mount if your next node is &lt; 236 yards away. 
---
235 yards running = 33.57s, travel form = 23.97s, mount = 23.98s
---
236 yards running = 33.71s, travel form = 24.08s, mount = 24.07s. 
---
However, the 2/2 feline swiftness comes into play when combat is your next node.
---
Full energy bar is 10 seconds with 0/5 furor
---
Full energy bar is 6 seconds with 5/5 furor
---
Full energy bar is 4 seconds with 5/5 furor + Wolfshead Helm
---
Assuming you want 100 energy as you trim your travel time in travel form or mount by 4s, 6s, or 10s and enter into cat form for the last leg. this is a LOT of seconds to enter combat with 100 energy. (entering with 100 energy greatly shortens combat time)
---
Assume you have 5/5 furor and no helm. Trim travel time by 6 seconds:
---
2/2 FS cat form is used to travel to your next combat node &lt; 765 yards away. 765 yards!!!! 
---
In fact 765 yards is so far away, that you will never use travel when your next combat node is combat. You will either stay in cat form, or mount up.
---
2/2FS cat form is superior to 60% mount when your next combat node is &lt; 437 yards away! That's a lot of yards. 
---
2/2FS cat form is superior to 100% mount when you next combat node is &lt; 235 yards away.
---
Now lets be real, you dont need to enter combat with 100% energy every time, or even most of the time. But you get the idea, 2/2 FS is SUPER handy when your next travel node is combat. 
---
Everyone has their own liking to how much energy they want to have when they enter. Also, the stronger the mobs you are going to fight, the more energy you want going in. Makes you less likely to die. 
---
I generally like to guesstimate the following distance to determine which forms I use:
---
&lt;~150 yards and next node combat == stay in cat.
---
&gt; ~150y and &lt;~400 yards and next node is combat == travel form, then into cat form for last 40 yards.
---
&gt; ~ 400y and next node combat == mount, then into cat form for last 40 yards.
---
&lt;~235y and next node not combat = travel form
---
&gt;~235y and next node not combat = mount
---
It seems silly, but 1-2 seconds here and there REALLY add up to a lot of seconds when questing. I havent done the math, but over your 1-60 leveling, 2/2 FS can probably equal hours of play time saved.
---
No one got banned, but fayejin didn‚Äôt die either.  faked her death
---
My husband and I used to live in Alaska and played on an East Coast server. We had zero issues with latency.  The only problem was that a lot of the guilds raided too early in the day for us.  However, I have a feeling that this should not be an issue on Grob, since everyone that wants to RP and PVP will congregate there. We now live in Florida and plan to play on Grobbulus. Grobmob unite!!!
---
Hey Staysafe!  Loved your beta streams!  Offtopic, but I've relatively last minute decided to roll warlock!  I thought I remembered you posting something during beta about using imp over VW in classic because it didn't hold threat right and also something about imp drain soul not being worthwhile.  do you have any one stop shop updated resources with these sorts of tips on Warlock!
---
&gt; If they show up I will just gank them until they cry. 
---
Lmao what, as if they‚Äôll be alone at any point?
---
How do people have work computers that let you get on reddit but not twitter... I'm just salty cuz I have neither
---
I'm going to play again! Started at vanilla originally and played till 6 years ago. Going to restart my undead lock again, really looking forward to this!! Any change I can join u guys? I'm a Dutchie
---
You're not the only one.
---
There's going to be plenty of "normal" guilds as well. Especially on a RP-*PvP* server, which usually have a more varied population than pure RP servers.
---
Ranking in p2 ist gonna be lovely in EU pvp. Also no way they will remove layering, like ever. But i'm not even surprised, its blizzard after all. They arent known for their smart decisions. Such a big opportunity - better throw it away. 
---
Also feeling of community on such large and layered servers? OK then xd
---
Esfand said on his stream that they already ruled it out as they don't want to ruin that type of community, especially since there is only one RP-PvP server.
---
What about Auctioneer?
---
You guys really seem to miss the point don't you. Wdym phase 2? By phase 2 the playerbase from launch will be halfed, at least. The point in where they will introduce new characters is prob when people hit lvl 10-20. First few days. When que timers aren't going down and/or the population is increasing. By that point there is totally no problem in server hopping. There is no community formed and if there was you can ez rebuild everything that was there before.
---
13 years and I've always read that as Mankirk... brain, whut!
---
Jerk off
---
Genuine question. What exactly are the points many people want to avoide streamer servers? A plus for streamer server might be community events?
---
Thinking of myself, the biggest problem might be huge influx at the start which makes many people not choose the server and once the streamer quits, the server might die?
---
But what else?
---
They all can be of done within 10 hours of gong hit, right?
---
You should just be able to sit in bear form and clap most warriors no problem. They can‚Äôt hit hard against beat and don‚Äôt generate enough rage if they aren‚Äôt hitting hard. So you end up being able to outlast them with ease.
---
Major streamers, yes probably. They've been playing on the same beta server together and benefit from playing with other streamers and all being on one server for events such as duel tournaments. Probably will be small-medium sized streamers on other servers though, I'm sure
---
Thank you so much!
---
This just in, people like to get paid for what they do. Shocking!
---
&gt; In terms of 1-55 5-man dungeons, which means most of of the &gt; 5-man, avoidance/mitigation hardly matters if in the end bear gonna be overall bulkier and no warrior will have avoidance talents/itens during leveling, so warrior's avoidance will be low too anyway.
---
Did a streamer kiss your dad, or why the hate?
---
They are living the childhood dream. And pretty sure most of them wont take free shit because they want to actually earn stuff for themselves. The problem with streamers is their mindless followers, not the streamers themselves...
---
Could that possibly be because they are actually bigger than everyone else, so it makes sense?
---
Also the fact that they haven't tried to do a lot of marketing for it... More players will be attracted
---
People rarely hate streamers, they hate what they bring with them.
---
Hopefully nobody steals my old names: √Årth√§s and L√©g√≤l√°z
---
And does that number mean unique accounts/individual people? Because everyone has at least 1 alt. The average person probably has a bank alt and 1-3 other characters they actively level, you think?
---
3k seems alright, if that means the average number of people online at any given time.
---
Banned for what? Pvp on a Pvp server? What did you think was gonna happen? Even Helen Keller saw it coming.
---
Most of the servers are gonna be pretty full regardless
---
Oh gods ...it's going to be Crushridge all over again isn't it?
---
If they were going to roll RPPVP, why would they change that for 10-20 ping? This whole thing seems overblown. I think it would make the most sense for it to be EST, but it's not like server time forces raid times.
---
This information is outdated, check the avoidstreamers discord to stay up to date: [https://discord.gg/T6NV9b](https://discord.gg/T6NV9b)
---
Yeah I agree. I will play on a Streamer Server. I am not truly interested in the streamers. I enjoy the thought of all the extra people that come with people on the server. I also fear that one day the steamers will give up on said server and slowly die off.   
---
Streamer servers will comprise of a lot of streamer chat but that dosent mean it wont have natural selected groups of friends and other that arnt even aware of the streamers
---
13 is actually more than I expected. I expected 8.
---
Too many servers is detrimental to community health. Too little is absolutely the way to go.
---
I hope my 7 days vacation starting on launch day wasn't for nothing. We really must be able to transfer servers (for free??) when layering gets removed and I really really hope layering is removed asap. Feels like they still haven't figured out the true meaning of vanilla experience.
---
There was a rumor that Forsen and Soda we‚Äôre rolling on Grobbulus. There has been zero confirmation to it.
---
They care about content though, and what would give more content than having all the streamers on one single server?
---
Just wanted some clarification since it was changed in later patches. Thanks!
---
Exactly. That‚Äôs also why Gnome hitbox is smaller. Oh wait...
---
I thought it was already said it will for sure be a EST PvP server, is that not true?
---
I hear that is is a passive bonus equivalent to about 1 character level. so not much.
---
I really like this while eating / drinking in a pvp area. That's its true benefit :D
---
So sorry, I was unaware about the guild threads.
---
You are so entitled its ridiculous.  Streamers owe you nothing.
---
All good reasons. thank you for your time.  I use bobo because it helps level choices, it has talentsequencer addon for accurate talent placements.  It lists spells you pick up on even levels, which some addons do in game, showing how helpful that is.  Those help me plan on min maxing when to pick up some spells for caster classes that are duds at rank 1 but start to come online at higher ranks.
---
That durability graphic is still in game.
---
can you upload it to wallpaper engine on Steam?
---
Almost none of them are west coast. Soda, Asmon, and Esfand are Central and Swifty is East coast
---
one of the best things about Ely was that i saw this one other druid (i was a druid too) every few levels the whole way to 60, it was so cool.  i never spoke to him, i just liked that i ran into him from time to time.  Once i saw him getting ready for a raid with his guild and it warmed my cow heart
---
I'm east coast but work 2nd shift and want to raid so I would need to raid with west coasters... will the ping really be that different from an east and west coast server ?
---
It's the only RPPVP server. Everyone in NA who wants to play on that server type will be there regardless of time zone. It will not be difficult to recruit players regardless of time zone. There will be raids starting when east coast players log on all the way until west coast players log off.
---
That's a reason to avoid that server. Every noob gonna think that and poof Thalnos full of lil noobs.
---
Awesome. Now if you could please point us to your source of data for your millions claim so we can all join with you in your anger.
---
Mine talks!
---
Once people leave the starting zone they don't all go to the same place.  How is it any different then me going to The Barrens and you going to Silverpine?
---
I don't know if this is true or it isn't but, I do know part of stay's stream is that he trolls. This could be a troll move.
---
Lol what a dumb dumb response
---
I'm calmer than you are.
---
2.4
---
Talking about banning people? I get not wanting to play on a server with a big streamer, but this is pretty absurd.
---
... Just what in the hell has this to do with anything at all, ever? Some people, like myself, don't like the "pro gamer guy" type of streamer that's all. Also Tips is a major noob, so some users don't appreciate that he's one of the main Classic streamers.
---
They did /say In vanilla

That's a great idea, thanks!

I'm from EU so I don't care about your bloody streamer server. Only things are care about are our lousy 2 EN PvP servers and that *melee warlock PvP video* you plan to make at some point. :)
---
Deep dude you figured out that entertainers put on a show for their audience and their on camera persona isn't actually who they are
---
500k players in an underground scene with realms that close as often as they open.....
---
any news if he actually rolls on EU server? also, he will msot likely quit after few weeks so no reason to avoid that server lol
---
This is prob gonna freak u guys out, but those non-streamer servers.......you know what else they are going to be? They are going to be fertile ground for aspiring new streamers. With no big fish around, all kinds of wierd kids are probably going to be spamming their stream links, and doing all kinds of stupid shit to try to get attention and become ‚Äúthe celeb‚Äù of the server. 
---
There‚Äôs no time machine guys. 2005 is gone. Gaming has been commodified and there‚Äôs no going back.
---
Was playing it yesterday, my imp was yapping on about how I needed help killing things!
---
This was months ago and since then he‚Äôs confirmed multiple times that he‚Äôs going on a pvp server.
---
It‚Äôs a trap!
---
Just don't look at the in game clock. It's the only server of that type.
---
The boss dropped items from the original Scepter quest are singular - one person only. The shards, Broodlord Lashlayer's head, etc.
---
Later on it was changed to be multi-lootable.
---
Sodapoppins World of Warcraft Classic Discord , I mentioned it in another post and someone followed up with a picture in response to the post pretty much the same as this one.
---
Yarr!
---
&gt; if you herb or disenchant while leveling they will change gear constantly needing new enchants and so on.
---
Once again that is not in any kind of what what I said, this is what your, most likely underdeveloped brain, understood it as.. That is not my fault.
---
The younger folk
---
*1. The Spanish are planning to take one of them over
---
i dont get the 'obvious' part  
---
it'd be the obvious choice, so they are trying to avoid that, even though they are planning to announce it?  
---
or it'd be the obvious choice to be the most populated. but, you would think they'd want that.  
---
lol cant figure out what on earth he means by that
---
The population will fall off a cliff after 2 weeks.
---
Thalnos i can‚Äôt stop seeing as Thanos :/
---
No it won‚Äôt. Settle down. See you launch date.
---
I think it's mostly just squeezing some social aspect out of a trivial quest on a stress test that doesn't last more than 2 days, I really don't believe many people are going to sit and wait for a small amount of exp from the starter zones, as soon as barrens/westfall hits then for sure it can be worth doing. I think given the posts from the stress test being screenshots in booty bay, each capital, lines (like so many god damn lines) that people didn't really care.
---
Good luck getting multiple other people to follow you around.
---
Could you do that for EU servers too please? Would really appreciate it.
---
That would be awful since there's only one RP-PvP server. I might end up having to roll on the EU RP-PvP server if he rolls on the NA RP-PvP server.
---
Well, they have narrowed it to 2 servers, 1  East PVP and 1 West PVP
---
So avoid those 2 servers
---
my healthcare says otherwise
---
I think it's maybe a term for Gen Z?
---
This is beyond terrible. Can‚Äôt believe I waited two years for this shit show...
---
It's a self fulfilling prophecy. By adding layering, they are likely going to alienate about 50% of the players who would otherwise continue to play, so the population will die off directly as a result of layering.
---
By adding layering, they have completely 100% defeated the entire damn point of bringing back vanilla. I mean seriously, what's the point anymore?
---
If they were honest and just told us layering is here to stay, I bet most people (including myself) wouldn't even bother playing, but they won't do that because then they lose out on some quick cash.

---
To my knowledge it was /roll 100 100
---
You had to give it a range, no?
---
On the other hand, they won't be able to get within a mile of BRM on their own raid nights without causing a huge PvP event as people trying to gank them clash with their groupies, so the WPvP environment should be great.
---
Let's say only 500k play classic...divide that by 12....that's 41000 players per server....pve will have less players then pvp... and that's with 500k a number which I think is extremely low... I agree with the OP. They overly underestimate classic. I see classic being over several million players
---
I think I just got that reference.
---
i always wanted to go to alaska /s
---
Check the raw data spreadsheet that the mod posted, they added my stuff to it and included all the servers and formatted nicely.
---
Easy there bro
---
Sure lets do $60 per token takes two to redeem for 1 month of game time
---
It might be a bug for some people then üò£. I thought I was going crazy because I thought they did, but my imp is silent and still is. He grunts when summoned but that‚Äôs it and he doesn‚Äôt talk or say anything right now. I might reinstall classic really quick or try to verify game files. I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs wrong.
---
I thought you had to give it a range.
---
for example "/roll 100 100" if you want to guarantee a roll of 100
---
I'd imagine there are quite a few folks that have used the same character name since the original launch of the game back in 2004 that would like to see their's reserved as well.  
---
Wouldn't be a bad thing for Blizzard to consider doing that, just look at existing paying accounts, see if they have any active characters from initial launch and reserve those names for that person.  If the player decides he doesn't want the name he can release it.  
---
Now that would be good marketing on Blizzard's side.
---
So what‚Äôs so bad about the streamers? I‚Äôm not defending them, just curious.
---
what kind of dumbass shit is that. Is it seriously that hard to put a est server on a est server?
---
On a related note, I'm wondering how they plan to get their names reserved.
---
There's gonna be 5000 spergs ready to instantly grab names like Asmongold and Sodapoppin the second they can.
---
Or even better idea.  Lets put them in loot boxes and call them surprise mechanics
---
Thank god
---
These people will literally never learn. They are still defending Blzzard, and they will a year later when layering is still around but Blizzard will "totally remove it when Naxx comes out. They said so!"
---
and I axe
---
With 2004 technology... Now we have better servers and layering, and Blizz said they may add more if necessary.
---
Let them do that, less people for us to deal with on the other servers.
---
Was thinking exactly the same thing, so this is definitely something to consider. Now, we just need to establish where they're going.
---
Think about it like this. This game is old, has been seen my millions of players to some extent, and is not in any way new or fresh. Outside of raids clearing content quicker than normal and some fun battle ground shenanigans, the only way to create dynamic and interesting situations that are new and exciting is through World PVP.
---
Otherwise you're just watching a streamer grind out the game. There is no chance for conflict at random while they are say... mining a node, or traveling between zones, or afking to grab a drink.
---
The trolls and griefing would make the game more *interesting*. A streamer may get rekt a few times, but a streamer may also be able to cultivate a following of level 60 bodyguards who help them farm.
---
Then you've got people building griefing groups to raid the streamer and their body guards.
---
Makes for a much more interesting dynamic for the viewers and seems like the drama would be cash money for these high end streamers with tons of fans.
---
Take Hollywood. A lot of "Hollywood Drama" is manufactured because fans eat that shit up. It sells magazines and draws crowds and brings people to shit-post news websites and finds it's way onto main news websites on slow news days.
---
Streamers wanting to make money off this shit would be best off starting some serious shit with an opposing faction streamer, ramping the fake drama up to 11 and watch the crowds go wild and make it to the top of r/all with ease.
---
Can we add him to the list so I can join his server?
---
They aren't likely to roll PST so I doubt Whitemane
---
Venruki is Canadian. Explains it all!
---
That's some quality formatting you got there son
---
I'm also betting there will be quite a few guilds for his fans too.
---
It's gonna be rough.
---
Hey I just looked and emotes is checked by default.. so I think they've made it so you can't see rolls unless you are in a group.
---
damn i feel sorry for you... imo pvp realm should be the default choice and is the genuine experience
---
Why are streamers to be avoided?
---
Hellfire might be, that's the only server I've chosen myself.
---
why in the world would you assume hes lying to you
---
yea but it fucks a lot of shit up regardless. Personally I think they're lowballing it pretty drastically
---

---
Fair enough, I just haven't known anyone that I play with to care about it in any capacity.
---
It is a better idea, for those that do care, they just seem to not be doing any CST servers right now I guess. Not entirely sure why. Probably because people like me don't care about the server time, though...
---
They will be less cohesive than retail servers right now. These are truly mega-servers.
---
I levelled as Ret during classic. I did multiple dungeons including and up to UBRS. I think I only got one or two comments about being Ret. 
---
Overall your damage will be low but everyone loves the buffs you give. You can also act as an off tank or an emergency healer if needed (or main if the healer quits). It was perfectly fine for me. People here just make a big deal about it.
---
Ret leveling is fine in dungeons. Anyone denying ret a group while leveling is silly.
---
We HAVE to level as ret (mostly). We are allowed in dungeons.
---
Source? What's worse, a handful of dead servers with a small amount of people affected, or the entire population of classic wow being affected by layering?

---
I have no idea what will happen. That‚Äôs just what Esfand and Venruki have let slip. That was hours ago as well. They‚Äôve probably changed their minds by now. 
---
If all of the streamers were smart, they‚Äôd follow along with Soda‚Äôs idea. Not stream for a bit, maybe play under a different name during that time so they can actually enjoy it. Then when they‚Äôre ready they can switch to their stream characters and start up like nothing happened.

yesterday on the stress test asmon brought some alliance to fight in durotar and for like 30 min the general chat was all INV ASMON LAYER spam
---
Which is why layering exists...
---
It doesn't. Tanking and healing requires nothing but a face to roll over the keyboard. 
---
What is "15-18 raiding" even supposed to mean? There is no 15-18 raiding. Do you mean mythic 15-18 dungeons? If yes....well, you are wrong once again. Faceroll tank + healing combined with skipping content and aoe-zergfests have nothing to do with hardness. 
---
The fact that your adrenaline is pumping because you see a timer on the top right of your screen does not mean that the content is actually hard; it just means that you got successfuly played by Activision.
---
I'm clearly very settled. 
---
Truth is, guy who typically jumps in a thread shouting "CALM DOWN/SETTLE DOWN" is the one who's not calm or settled.
---
In phase 2, when some people have quit and others just play less frequently than at launch, layering is supposedly turned off and there will be a 3000 cap of simultaneous players.
---
The night elf sleeping is a nice touch :)
---
For real. I feel like the end game this time around is gonna be amazing compared to back in the day as far as dedicated players will to put in the effort for raid progression. Probably less all together still, but more players will be playing cuz they want to not because of the FOMO when wow got as big as it did before and during BC.
---
I mean... they will 100% have free transfers to new servers, assuming they do open more.
---
Doesn't matter, everyone will miss the point of the and argue over his phase ideas and whatever he said in the end
---
It represents 30k people who are passionate enough about the game to go fill out an unofficial survey on a site they sit on all day getting their Classic fill. Its called sample bias. 
---
This subreddit's data is skewed towards pserver players, current retail players, and hardcore players. Most casuals wont fill that survey out, and most hardcore players will.
---
I think I know.  
---
I think streamers at first where afraid at the number of players who would come to harass them. So they decided to keep their server choice under wraps (This could very well still be happeneing).   
---
Now that theres a server list and its not a large as soon of us thought it might of been. I think they realise either way theyre fucked one way or another.  
---
He probably said "too obvious" because he wanted to hide which server they where going to join, something like Herod is obvious plain as the eye can see because so far its the most invested server by players.
---
 Its an EZ choice for a lot of players and thus the "streamer server" would need to be something like Faerlina or other. I dont think a lot of people know this but Streamers and their crowds are not the majority here by a long shot. They look big in their streams and in their groups but there will be far more people who play normally and dont even think about streamers, even on the streamer server.
---
lol! Why won‚Äôt the government protect us from these murderous cups?!
---
That's a very stupid suggestion, that ignores my point entirely.
---
Just wait like, 3 months and it'll be down to 5k.
---
A few too many asguardian ale my friend.
---
so in 2004 vanilla wow came out with like 40 servers with no hype. Now there's crazy hype and it's coming out with like 12 servers. Shows how the quality of this garbage company has fallen.
---
This is not a sollution that we can accept. Months and months will have passed by the time the servers go to Phase 2. Sadly, with the way it looks, too much damage will be done by then. The economy will be ruined, and being forced to transfer people over completely kills any sense of community.
---
If enough people are still around, queues are absolutely not going to replace layering. I love how this subreddit thinks queues on launch day are unacceptable, but are totally fine with layering for 3 months and then significantly worse queues for the remainder of the serve's life. It takes some crazy mental gymnastics to still support layering.
---
Lighting in Vanilla could be set to very similar levels of detail that you see in classic, people didn't have the video power to crank it up that high though.
---
Haven't played since cata, and gave up on wow tbh. Upon seeing classic being re-released, I was thinking this might be fun. So I did some precursory YT and web research to get an idea of what was going on etc. Honestly after seeing how many of the streamers during beta were just complete childish jackholes, I want to avoid them as best as possible. SO thanks for putting up the website. Even if these knuckleheads don't announce till after opening, I'll still go to another server, I know I can hit 60 in a week or less, and it won't really put me behind. I simply do not want to deal with the idiot drama that most of them seem to attract and ooze.   
---
Jumped on today for a bit to see if I was going to enjoy it and yep, lots of memories from opening day 2004 when a group of us had enough of EQ and made the jump.
---
I'm glad Whitemane is safe.
---
&gt; Sure bud, ignore reality and jump on the nonsense bandwagon.
---
You're the one ignoring reality right now. I'll say it again, you guys thought we were crazy for thinking NA would have so few realms and guess what, we were right. Yet again, just like every other time.
---
&gt; they said layering would be gone by phase 2 when world bosses show up, period
---
Stop believing them, pay attention to what they are actually doing as opposed to what they claim. It's amazing how gullible you people are.
---
&gt; If there are too many people, they sit in a queue or they take the transfer to a new or underpopulated server.
---
HILARIOUS! Fucking hilarious. After all this time of you people saying queues are absolutely unacceptable on launch day, now you're totally fine with them layering the game for 2-3 months and then suddenly having outrageously long queues for, not just a few days, but for months to years!
---
Then they have to fight over who has the most followers to worship them on that server... I'm sure every server will be hell with this few.
---
made with mematic
---
I have never seen someone get so mad about a simple comment I made. It's honestly funny to me üòÇ
---
Hmmmmmmm üòèüòèüòè
---
So is GreekGod
---
Dude T Posing right in the middle.
---
3k is literally empty.
---
They already said what servers they will NOT be on. Play on those
---
Maybe, but a major difference is that today spinning up more servers is a matter of an authorizing signature and a few keystrokes.
---
Look just learn English, it's not that hard
---
Madseason is going to join Esfand's guild last I heard and I do believe they're all going to be on the same server with Asmon, Soda, et al.
---
I'm a moron for pointing out that the way there were designed is the way they were designed?
---
Don't tell him about 35-40.
---
I hope so. All I've heard today are regular pvpers moving in.
---
What‚Äôs to be in a stalemate about? If they agree on Eastern PvP, just pick one. Are they seriously disagreeing about name?
---
Is that confirmed safe because it's what I was planning on rolling
---
I'd say every expansion after classic was a nail in the coffin for this game. started wth tbc, which was cool, new and fresh ofc but well, wotlk was truly the beginning of the end for wow. It was at it's peak then and that when the ballon popped.
---
Just so you guysa know, they ruled thalanos out because that's the BR server. Avoid.
---
Could you also add Grobbulus to the list?
---
Expired, please post "infinite duration" link
---
Fairbanks is not East Coast btw
---
We're all still left waiting though because the Brazilians are rolling thalnos
---
Which lends itself to the idea that these 13 are the \*initial\* set, not the final set, far more.
---
Doesn't the price come from an addon?
---
ive re-examined the image and there is no breastplate
---
Did they actually post the stats somewhere? I can't find them.
---
pvp is content for the stream...
---
Wait, pve players want faction imbalance ?
---
Yeah, what u/suspicious_lemons said. It‚Äôs going to be the mega streamer server that Asmongold, Staysafe, Esfand, and a lot more play on. The population will be *massive*.
---
I mean exactly what I said lol
---
It's not 100% but it seems very likely they've chosen to roll East coast.
---
Not sure why I was downvoted for asking a question.. but that‚Äôs for the info. That does sound terrible..
---
Start a 25 chain tweet about #MeToo
---
once I get home.
---
Lol a wild shaman appears and uses purge
---
I like his version better
---
I hope this is a troll.
---
Well, perhaps they were the nails in one side of the coffin. But the nails in the other side of the coffin came from each expansion that you sank time into, that's contributing to a cumulative burnout
---
Are you sure?
---
Esfand ?? üëÄ
---
Wow, strawman much. You have ignored my points, and are attacking ideas I have never had. Maybe you should calm down for a while and think about the things you say. 
---
Blizzard says a thing officially, then they do it. It's that simple. I'm sorry you are all amped up for phasing to last forever, but it isn't reality.
---
3 for horde
---
That's really pathetic. Either blizzard wants classic to fail or they are incredibly cheap and dont want to spend a little more money on servers
---
Let me direct you to [this info graphic on why it doesn't matter](https://giphy.com/gifs/reactiongifs-4R71Engp5NgHK)
---
nah was just a joke,  Staysafe tweeted they wont be on Thalnos though,  so looks like thats where i'll end up]
---
Rarely anyone is going to have 30-40 rl friends to play and raid with. Most guilds are really only gonna be started with like 10-15 people that will make up the core of it that will have to recruit, help level and gear up  many more people before having 30-40 people to regularly raid with.
---
I think the quick cash crab has nothing on steady 11 million subscribers they had in the past vs some 1-2m it is now.
---
Lol last night when I was trying to go to sleep I caught myself staying up an extra hour just watching profession videos to see what I should work on.
---
Proof? I also want to avoid BR players - no offense to them
---
Zandalar has the best faction balance so far!
---
Can't wait to play on Herod with you guys ;)
---
Bobby b?
---
The big streamers like Asmon, Soda, etc will agree on one server to play on.
---
EASY, BOY! YOU MIGHT BE MY BROTHER BUT YOU'RE SPEAKING TO THE KING!
---
Originally tips said east coast pvp, which automatically ruled out Fairbanks and Whitemane. But others won‚Äôt confirm Whitemanes exclusion from consideration.
---
...just as it‚Äôs actually getting more relevant...
---
Correct.
---
Well duh you noob you should know Strimmers bad automatically /s
---
Tbh people thought you were just being "pro-streamer"
---
How did that get determined?
---
I love how you refused to even acknowledge the second half of my comment.
---
Okay, I agree there.
---
balance druid
---
I was playing pve anyway, so it wasn't much of a concern for me, but cool of you guys to give everyone a heads up.
---
Out of curiosity though, why not just announce which one now?
---
Can you not fuck it up for everyone else please? You have your own realms.
---
What's BR?
---
ill check again
---
So a guy who couldnt give a flying fuck about streamers? Allrighty then
---
I‚Äôm playing Human Rogue most likely ! I‚Äôll definitely be on a pvp server too. I‚Äôm trying to get my girlfriend into it and we were watching madseasons class guide! She was hyped watching the warlock class!
---
Oh fosho. It boggles the mind but nerd rage is a real thing.
---
Watching Venruki he said it WILL be a EST. So I think whitemane is safe. Money is still on Herod.
---
&gt;Tipsout ... reputation  
---
hhahah xD good one
---
The bigger streamers have stated that they will play on one server.
---
Electricavenue
---
Editing in a different way to view it.
---
Welcome home.
---
Well, in two weeks time anyway...
---
but we are playing 1.12 not 1.3.0
---
Wish it was eastern time....
---
He's been cultivating mass I see. To live up to your expectations.
---
Cool story, bro
---
Pagle is a human, isn't he? ;)
---
They need to add more realms, this is ridiculous.
---

*gets stuck permanently*
---
I thought he was from there but lived in CA
---
Yea the addon is probably seeing the bullet amount and reading it as the stacksize of the ammo pouch, so value of the pouch times the amount of bullets
---
ah, yes, them yougins.
---
Just please not whitemane
---
Great stuff mate. Here's hoping for a healthy server with active horde and alliance guilds!
---
Yeah when I played back in the day it was so fun when you'd get in a group to raid Stormwind. And if Orgrimmar was getting raided on that was fun to defend. I think there would be negatives but the huge community events could be really fun.
---
Thexaco
---
Peter Paste-Eater with his 8 viewers is welcome. I just want to level without the garbage.
---
I do agree
---
At some point I'd probably asked myself too that is it better to start too few servers and add quickly if more is needed or is it better to merge low pop servers down the road and totally mess up their economy and stuff. I think I'd still vote the first.
---
He's literally one of only a handful of streamers I can see why people even watch, plus add to the fact the guy is incredibly skilled.
---
And they deleted their account. What. A. Badass.
---
You‚Äôre the only rogue that replied... 
---
You say too much brother
---
CLASSiC
---
BFA you gotta spam so many buttons it's tiring...and gives you arthritis
---
1.7 mil active subs, a small portion will go to classic, these complaints are for no reason and just complaining to complain
---
yeah agreed
---
Im guessing they have 2 servers of each and will add more when ppl start creating characters on 12th of August
---
Ziqo lives in Sweden tho
---
Thanks for the reply. Please don't take Whitemane :D
---
Oh god. Youre saying Thalnos will be the new Ragnaros?
---
Fucking exactly. They are creating there own issue with layering that it was supposed to solve. Complete mess.
---
Meh some people want to reserve alt names and also reserve names for people who cant yet :/
---
They are just going to layer the servers til the end of time. Keep in mind, there were 89 servers on launch day in 2004 in the US alone. The population is surely going to be bigger this time.
---
Oh, so you mean like in the original launches. I won't waste time in queues since I'll be constantly logged in. Also, create a button pressing machine to press move forward every 3 minutes
---
What about oceanic ?
---
They wanted only 10 but then they added RPPVP last minute
---
Mankirk‚Äôs wife.
---
The thing you have to remember about the survey is that it does not count all the people that aren't reading Reddit or other sources for every but of info about the game. There a big chunk of people that will be playing that will never read forums/Reddit.
---
In 2004? Nahhh
---
So from what i've heard is that spanish, italian and greek people are making an unofficial server on Golemagg (PVP). Scandinavian, Dutch, Brexiters and others who tend to speak English are going Shazzrah (PVP). 
---
This means that Shazzrah will be absolutely full of gankers, noobstomping private server guilds such as APES are probably rolling here as well. Honestly if you ain't about getting shat on i would recommend going any of the PVE servers.
---
I play with people in California, and Florida. I live in Saskatchewan. My province doesn't even use daylight savings. Somehow there is no problem. Why is this such a huge issue for you?
---
They really don't believe this is gonna be a success. Or maybe they can't let this become a success because it would embarass Retail?
---
anyone who wanted good arena pugs went to that server because of playerbase, not streamer twitch chat garbage

Yeah, that's great point. We already took something probably from the normal RP server with RP-PvP, so they deserve something back. Besides i feel like Grobbulus could grow into a name that we wouldn't trade down the road.
---
Same here, aura durations also didn't work
---
Horde don't deserve any better.
---
If there was a British only server you might actually see lines quite often. We love our queues so we do.
---
Whats the alternative? Really? Adding more servers.
---
Hahahaha nice.

Yeah wtf is that. A sub full of hackers or so

Yes, you can be reported for it. It's basically the only RP rule that get's enforced by Blizz.

I'd be concerned about advertising H/A ratios.
---
When you list realm pops, it helps balance things out (assuming none are wildly underpopulated)
---
When you list H/A ratios, might trigger a stampede of each faction to a different server - exacerbate existing imbalance.
---
at least they're going to one server, that seems like a nice move from them tbh
---
Just party up once and you‚Äôll stay on the same layer from there on.

---
Learn to read dumbass.
---
&gt; Just taking a litte snippet from the survey, but 80% of the population wants to go pvp and only 16% pve, yet Blizz plans on releasing 5 pvp servers and 4 pvp servers.
---
The subreddit census is has *extreme* selection bias. The majority of people who answered it are the hardcore side of the game, you're much less likely to get a casual player to answer an unofficial survey.
---
NoFunAllowed. Don't hold a funeral in a contested area.
---
Thanks for the info. Maybe RPPVP is the better server ? Or pveis the best ? Also what is APES ? I read it here and there a few times
---
So not curries playing WoW 12 hours a day and Monster Munch?
---
These people are crying to cry, 1.7 mil active subs lol... they‚Äôre all pulling numbers out of their asses because they‚Äôre upset they were only given one option

You‚Äôre a complete moron lmao

---
Is there a list of servers for classic yet ?
---
it's obvious that the guy is either antisocial or funneling his popularity in a wrong way (which is unlikely)
---
It‚Äôs all hunter gear
---
I wonder which of those 5 PVP servers will become the unofficial Brazilian server. Better start practicing my Spanish in case I'm unlucky.
---
If that's true that would mean they do not expect an active pop of more than ~25000 players, which is 1/6th of the readers of this subreddit.
---
&gt; I honestly believe layering will be in classic forever, and one simple solution for this would be to lock people to a certain layer for a certain time when phase 2 hits.
---
I'm not entirely opposed to this, but they have to not only keep the layers locked, but totally separate them too. That means no shared auction house, no shared chat channels, no joining dungeon groups from other layers etc.
---
Thought that's what they should've done from the beginning instead of this pseudo-sharding route they chose.
---
The stress test servers seemed to be west coast due to the in-game time and my ping was 60-80 when I bothered to notice it.
---
As of the last time I checked the r/classicwow survey, &gt;30% of people here reported they have already organized into a guild. This might be up to 40-50% over the next few weeks. Even if a new server opens 3 days into the start of cWoW, almost none of these players will be moving. I believe that is what u/kevinhill92 is trying to explain.
---
50k is not even that many, that's the total amount of players, not online simultaneously. Simultaneous online is under 10% of total server pop.
---
i wished they went after the NA streamers tho.
---
I‚Äôm really starting to think blizzard is just sitting laughing at us all in their headquarters
---
When it comes to classic wow, it won't make the slightest difference, unless maaaaaybe at the very top level of PvP.
---
Na? Lul eu are the ones that got fucked
---
Sweet, thanks guys
---
I'm tempted to make one when I get off work but I know little when it comes to managing larger discord servers
---
I was a Ret Pally in Vanilla-BC. It‚Äôs fun, but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it for a beginner unless that wanted to mainly do PvP. It feels very weak for a starter class.
---
We know dude lmao . We are discussing a bug not warlock pet optimal gameplay.
---
Every day, thanks for your concern man. You‚Äôre shedding light on an important issue
---
does he? i didnt know, although i never actually watch him.
---
&gt; If all of the streamers were smart, they‚Äôd follow along with Soda‚Äôs idea. Not stream for a bit, maybe play under a different name during that time so they can actually enjoy it.
---
From a financial perspective, thats a horrible idea. The first week of Classic is going to have massive viewer numbers. 
---
In addition to the massive amount of money they will make week 1, they also will have a large audience that ordinarily doesn't watch WoW content. Its the perfect time to grow your brand.

People do not play 24 hours a day.
---
That's how servers work. It's important to keep the community somewhat small and independent instead of have megaservers.
---
I never disliked him because he was a noob. I strongly disliked him because he constantly touted himself as someone who really knew what he was talking about, when he clearly never bothered to put any effort into researching what was actually good.

https://twitter.com/MrGMYT/status/1159918829776068608
---
yeah everybody knows this, the whole point of the post is saying that some dungeons, like deadmines, never had their cap lowered to 5. through all of vanilla, even 1.12
---
Curious to know, how many people do you think will be playing two months down the line in your region?
---
Why is his twitter account banned?
---
For a smaller streamer, the easiest way to grow your brand is to be around big streamer.
---
I would expect most of them to head for Asmons server too.
---
Just adding an other question here. Will there be (or was in vanilla) those great pvp battles that everyone mentions on normal servers? I mean the one in between Tarren Mill and Southshore or the battle for Stonetalon Mountains. Is this possible on normal server too?
---
God, I hope not.
---
How about paladins or shamans?
---
I mean, I have explained this to you guys like a 100 x.   Maybe you should stop downvoting me, and actually fucking listen?
---
&gt; I want to gank people but can't take being ganked myself.
---
Sounds like you should probably go pve.  
---
For myself pvp is always the choice, assblasting greys and corpse camping as well as getting assblasted by skulls and being corpse camped is all part of the fun.  Never let alliance players live, red=dead.
---
If your server gets deleted in wow, you get deleted in real life
---
You let yourself get pushed around based on old information. Ferals were figured out post vanilla
---
Thank you for this.
---
Very neat. Between the previous 5-more-minutes-Tauren and the groggy morning Alliance, you've captured the dungeon group experience very well. Cool style!
---
The uncomfortable truth that layering is here to stay is slowly setting in for many people...
---
'Brexiters' haha tickled me that.
---
OP given what you said, a Normal server (PvE) will be the safest bet for you. RP-PvP could be an option, but because of the lack of English PvP servers it's likely that a large portion of the PvP playerbase will be rolling on the RP-PvP realm as an unofficial 3rd PvP server.
---
I meant for English people to choose, as Golemagg is apparently the unofficial Spanish server already.
---
That's my fear too. 99% trolls and pvpers, 1% RPers while the PvE RP realm will be a true RP realm
---
Wait a minute....what did they do to the ACTUAL undercity?
---
i believe he forgot the :P:p:P:p:P:p in his tweet
---
Not at all, there are FAR MORE non streamers they can just bomb them even if they try to dungeon farm there will be people waiting and camping.
---
You are insane if you think less than 100 people will try to steal their names man.
---
Scarlet monastery...scarlet monastery everywhere!
---
this is why you roll a rogue specifically for camping  streamers and their fans. I love Asmond but I'll 100% be rolling on the same server as him just for the chance at fucking with his fans.
---
Yeah, that or just a large group of friends which is what I have. Which can be even harder to organize since a lot of them are much more casual than others.
---
It is... inevitable.
---
If you come up with a suggestion like this, for the love of god do all of us a favor and stay away from Classic
---
I still don't see what damage was done, people are watching them 24/7 they aren't going to hide their stream, as soon as they are live their chats are going to be spammed with their stream and layer and what not, there is no escaping that.
---
Dem flyover states
---
RP-pvp have certain set of rules. You have to name your characters appropriately.
---
* Non-medieval or non-fantasy names (For example: Slipnslide, Robotman, Technotron)
---
* Names that reference well known people, characters, brands, places, or icons (For example: Britneyspears, Austinpowers, Mcdonalds, Georgewashington, Newyork)
---
* Names that consist of multiple words (For example: Inyourface, Welovebeef, Howareyou, Sixtyseventy)
---
RP servers don't let you discuss things that are not part of the warcraft universe in public channels. So you can't talk about movies, politics or anything not related to the game in any chat.
---
This can be really fun but definitely not for everyone. 
---
APES are a notorious private server guild that is knows for their try-hard players, market manipulation and collusion between the other faction to control prices of certain items. They are despised by almost all private server players because they tend to steamroll everyone. They are usually the reason why private server factions are imbalanced because people who have to play against them are kind of sick of their shit and re-roll or quit. 
---
Pve is pretty nice, but it won't let you experience vanilla to the fullest. You miss out on the "war" in world of WARcraft.
---
Ah then yes. RPpvp or shazzrah.
---
licking them balls for that fame.
---
Leveling to get hotw, then leveling towards NS is how I'll be leveling. Yes, you can't start at 30/21, but it's what I'll be doing.
---
Upvoted for honesty lol
---
Blizzard: you can subscribe so you can reserve your name on the server you want.
---
Also blizzard: You might need to reroll on other server were you might lose your name
---
Warlock and Hunter will get you to your goals fastest/ min effort. The Mage will be valuable as their utility in wow is amazing. The Rogue would be my pick for serious PVPers. Just my 2 cents.
---
Honestly posts like this piss me off...
---
Why not just fucking try it? Login, get to leveling, let them see if it's enough then move the fuck on.  If the servers crowded oh fucking well. Queues will be short, tons of players means AHs won't be shit and you can find groups for whatever content you're doing. There's NOTHING worse than ending up in a good game on a dead fucking server. 
---
Just fucking give it a chance Jesus
---
I was hoping to avoid streamers and the private server guilds. Fuck blizz and their cheap moneygrab
---
Lol i am just trying to be respectful and reply to everyone since they took the time to comment on my post. But thank you for the defense on my behalf nas. üíú
---
Yep they shouldn't get ANY special treatment or privileges in-game. They're just another person, period.
---
üî•üî•üî•
---
"What primary language will you'll be using in-game?"
---
This question very heavily needs to be separated by region (well, in EU at least).
---
Feral got a massive boost in tbc, in vanilla feral wasn't viable
---
Lol sounds about right
---
Dude...that's not enough servers. We're fucked.
---
Shaman and Paladin are going to be over played in Classic % wise. Druid is always the lowest as it's not the best class overall, whatever you do if you want to roll an overplayed class do not roll a Warrior, Mage or Rogue.
---
Not to mention, it's much more practical to merge two low pop servers than to "encourage" tens of thousands of players to leave a high pop server.
---
&gt;and the realm will have ridiculous queues, 
---
I am not sure about that. Mordern WoW doesn't have queue times, even for expansion releases.
---
wow, if only someone would‚Äôve warned us that layering wasn‚Äôt temporary...
---
oh wait
---
You don‚Äôt wanna know. Trust me.
---
Why are you so entitled that you get the greatest chance to reserve the name you want, but get mad at the popular streamer, who will have people actively trying to steal their names, that wants the same thing?
---
aw fuck, never heard of him before.
---
Opening up a new server due to over-population is fucking great. 
---
Closing a server or one server being dead af due to mediocre pop levels is dog shit.
---
Oh great let me just play while I'm at work. People are going to be on at normal weekday times in their timezones, the only people that will be alright are those without jobs or differing hows than the normal 8-5.
---
Yeah, I didn't really make that clear, but my point was that none of the places warriors have an advantage over druids matters for 5-mans
---
Fair enough. It sounds terrifying.
---
Stark I wish I could‚Äôve taken the whole week off lol. But I read it releases on the 26th at 6pm eastern time. I don‚Äôt get home till 8pm from work. I can play from then &amp; I have the next day, 27th off. So I don‚Äôt have to worry about sleeping early :)
---
Fairbanks is for pussies
---
Yeah but the OP was asking for what was the "least played dps spec in pve", I was suggesting that Ret Pally might not be so uncommon due to its rabid fanbase.
---
That's in no way or shape a responsibility that I bear.
---
 Players have the right to make reasonable requests if they are so inclined, and in those cases its up to the service providers to determine if it's viable or not to accommodate those requests.
---
You might think it fine to gatekeep such requests, but that's on you.
---
On the contrary, the easiest way to grow a small stream is to be around bigger streamers.
---
Small guys are mostly going to pick the same server.
---
I made a post on the official EU forums and everyone who replied said they did *not* get theirs, so I am 99% sure this is only on EU.
---
Hopefully Blizzard are aware of this and it will be active by release. If anyone on here has an original Collector's Edition on EU, please submit a bug report and ticket so we can get the message out.
---
I know it's only minor but I'll be mighty disappointed if I can't level up with my old zergling by my side!
---
r/wowcirclejerk
---
They would get mocked endlessly by chat if they rolled PvE servers.
---
Bunch of EDers showed up on the Grob discord and the quality went straight to the toilet.
---
Only thing to worry about is ping. If its 100+ its gonna suck for pvp.
---
I believe someone already made a subreddit for Fairbanks earlier
---

Wpvp is half of vanilla.
---
Imagine going on a pve server to avoid it
---
You're both right. They were perfected post-tbc. But because of stats/ gear there is no way to use it effectively in the rock-paper-spock of vanilla as a top pvp dps or as a top raid dps. Soz play resto or feral WSG, otherwise uninstall.
---
Source: Retail Vanilla, And 3x leveled 60's on 3x blizz-like PS.
---
Zandalar horde side added for now. We're undecided on how to handle two at the moment.
---
Yeah, but gear and level are a factor, and the old gank attempts
---
I doubt vanilla wow will be more popular in 2019 than it was back then.  Its still a bit niche, and will probably not appeal as much to the younger crowd.
---
I wouldn't post this here, the nerdraging nochangers are gonna froth.
---
Yes this is what we have been saying from the start, it's just that as time goes on there will be more and more people who realize it, so the posts won't be massively downvoted anymore.
---
Will Feral Druids have to sneak into MC raids, just like in Vanilla?
---
Still remember one guy going ‚Äú...why is there a cat Druid doing melee?‚Äù in TS while 39 people ignore him. xD
---
And on Earthen Ring EU!
---
What kind of name is remulos?
---
And a cool hat!
---
when i logged in yesterday there was well over 100 players in the starting area, dynamic spawn rates made in manageable but it was still a competition to even tag monsters, pretty sure the layers are smaller than 10k, and even then they should be gone by phase 2
---
Its pretty clearly against the ToS to snipe someone's elses name(both for impersonation and harassment), so it wouldn't surprise me if Blizzard decide to save themselves some work and just reserve names.
---
I just want to be on a server that isn't the mega strummer one. I want a chance at some epic world pvp, not a guild of nobodies zerging my nuts
---
they will not turn it off... period...
---
imho it‚Äôs disgraceful for blizzard to call this game CLASSIC!
---
Blizzard also knew how big the French/German communities were, but waited until the public outcry to add them. Don‚Äôt put blind faith in blizzards ‚Äúdata‚Äù
---
&gt;  they seem to be named for nostalgia vanilla things
---
Zandalar Tribe? The LAST troll tribe they actually introduced to the game, and only became a faction we could actually interact with in the very latest expansion. And that is the name for the RP server, lul. I gotta agree with the other guy, the EU ones at least are pretty shit.
---
What do you mean by phasing?
---
Going off of what I notice. Blizzard LOVES to advertise their stuff like crazy and every where they can. BFA ads were everywhere. I have even seen ads for WC3: Reforged. But I have not seen anything really for Classic. Honestly it feels more like an independent development that you need to be in the know for. Thats why I don‚Äôt believe Blizzard is fully behind Classic as much.
---
Classic game design is a past thing as well. Modern MMO design is pushing towards more Action RPG with less community interaction. Personally most modern MMO feel like single player games with a built in chat room to me. Since thats what the business is going to, thats what those making decisions will go towards. I don‚Äôt agree with that but that how it usually goes. So of the decision is made to make new content for classic, those are the people that will decide what that content is.
---
Now I don‚Äôt want that myself. I agree that TBA &amp; WotLK servers would be a good idea as well. But I don‚Äôt really have the good faith in Blizzard that I used to have.
---
I‚Äôm confused. Is the 10 the max settings on classic?
---
Some of you people are just dumb. Thinking that hording items in random people's inventory for the sake of keeping things "the same" is just stupid lol
---
This is one of those things that is a clear oversight
---
Healing and buffing random people is strangely satisfying. You know that you just made someone‚Äôs day better.
---
Hey dude - Shazzrah here. 
---
https://discord.gg/huTAr4s
---
Thanks for the effort you've put in :)
---
we need to be able to see which link is for which server still maybE?
---
They are complete garbage in pvp and ok in dungeons, decent at solo leveling. The bad part is Classic is running of a patch where Enhancement has been nerfed (Windfury no longer procs off of windfury and Frostshock does not have a very short cd like before) So enhancement is not the way to go, if you want to be a dps shaman then I would recommend Elemental tbh it's not as gimped in pvp and even pve then enhancement.
---
Can blizzard just let them reserve their names? Fuck this.
---
Vanilla doesn't work like that. Each level rang has 2-3 zones you can level in with the exception of the starting zones.  After level 30 you are forced to quest in all the zones of 30-60 in order to get enough xp to get to 60.
---
You‚Äôre not getting guild banks.
---
Well people begged for rp, rp, pve, pvp etc. What do you expect?? Private servers are just 99 percent pvp and no one minds. 
---
If there's not enough demand then 'make more servers' doesn't work
---
I truly don't even know what you're trying to say...
---
I Agree, and both of them should choose the same server to even it out.
---
What do you think the end of beta event will be? GM‚Äôs usually spawn a ton of stuff.
---
How's loot competition in raids as a healer?
---
Easiest way is really just to create a new profile.
---
No, servers will have a capped number of layers and there will be a queue. Blizzard is hoping the queue will be long enough to get people to play elsewhere
---
FYI, it's a hardcore private server guild that has absolutely dominated several private servers over the past few years. The effects?
---
You want to grind to rank 14? Too bad, you're not in the APES premade. You want to kill world bosses? Too bad, you're not an APES member. You want to gather resources out in the world? Too bad, you will get camped by the APES.
---
This is not just some meaningless wanking, I don't really care about APES. I'm just saying that if you roll on an APES server, you might enjoy it less than if you rolled on a different one.
---
Yeah, luckily I'm PST so it doesn't look like it'll be an issue.
---
Thanks for your work.
---
its going to be a blood bath
---
They're names, stop being such a baby
---
Account sharing is against the ToS
---
So it's funny how can advocate for a workaround that's illegal and unsafe, just because "that's how it was." I'm actually more surprised Blizzard didn't do anything about it. It's kinda of like a legal admission now
---
Incredible!!!!
---
I see everyone saying that it wont matter, it does a bit. You wont get as much rep with your "real faction" and therefore wont get discount on spells and mounts and probably other stuff aswell.
---
Best looking animations, in classic? Bruh.
---
South American
---
They should've made his 3.33
---
yep. If you compare warrior and warlock. Buying every skill from the skill trainer adds up to the same amount.
---
Do you mean there's multiple "official" server discords popping up?
---
You are wrong that the tauren deadzone doesn't change.  I believe this to be a faulty system bug from 2.3 mashed with the rework.
---
[Confirmed 1.13 Combat Ranges](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TeY2oJdOWfkBA0c122wfgBD04c7Drt7IMACNhoCaF4o/edit#gid=604475205)  
---
This causes some interesting results that I am unable to confirm or refute from my experience and others' in classic.  Tauren hunters were rare, but I do often remember getting into 'Hunter vs Hunter' fights with them in the middle of the AV standoffs.
---
Great macro! 
---
Also, you have a working swing timer? Where on earth you get that? Indownloaded three yesterday - all out of date.
---
Uh, there's this thing called realm transfer that Blizzard often opens up for free to even out populations. Ever heard of it?
---
lmao this is kind of funny actually
---
This is simply a QOL change that doesn't affect the Classic experience whatsoever. One or two people hoarding an entire guild's worth of materials is not a good idea.
---
Thalnos is a boss in SM Graveyard and Faerlina is a boss in Naxx
---
You'd be surprised the type and amount of people that actually find that amusing...
---
In some ways it‚Äôs good but in other ways it‚Äôs bad. As there will be a few Druid‚Äôs, getting Tier pieces usually comes quite easy. As a result though you‚Äôll have low DKP so getting rings or weapons may take some extra time. All in all though you get gear quickly and with a few lucky bounces you can gain a lot of power quickly.
---
Not working :(
---
Is this a serious comment? Wtf
---
Awesome mannnn
---
The stress test wasn't for predicting population numbers.
---
And they have more servers waiting if they need them.
---

---
natural habitat lol
---
Thanks I'll be rolling on Whitemane now to avoid people like yourself OP.
---
Ha! Digital racism. Classic!
---
When you enter a raid, you can't do most of your quests and your XP plummets.
---
There was a reason people mostly did 5 mans.
---
If you want to try and feral go ahead, you'll be an easy kill for the opposing faction. You obviously have this all figured out. You do realize none of the tier armor does anything for feral though right?
---
I have blood when swinging with my axe and there are stars in the sky - seems to affect people differently. Seems like others are experiencing your issue as well.
---
Did you try /console ffxglow 0 to fix the weirdly bright lighting?
---

Never forget as well, 4% dodge is real. Cats are squishy and considering you‚Äôll get more Agi gear for armour and crit, it‚Äôs a really juicy piece of mitigation.
---
Considering the Durotar Starting zone will be the most heavily frequented one, I would very much advise you to level to 12 and meet at crossroads, or at least level to 8 or so and go to razor hill
---
Absolutely. I was shocked. Both regions have awful, awful names with a few good ones.
---
&gt; APES
---
whats that
---
What good is a blueprint of a horse carriage when you need to work on a Tesla Model 3 ?
---
Yes, I commenced the cat herding process of a bunch of old friends who mostly want to play causally as well and just put us into a small guild. A few of us will go hard though. If you want to go Pacific PVP, let me know and we can combine forces. ;)
---
But who does that include?
---
Which will likely be the reason classic will bomb. If they're going for nost-like online player counts per server, I for one am noping out. They can change class and raid balance all they want before jamming that many people together in one server imo.
---
this may be an experience unique to lower population RP servers, roll on moon guard (A) or wyrmrest accord (H) on US and visit the popular RP areas (SW mage quarter/cathedral/park, org valley of honor/silvermoon) and you will see a lot of rp going on you can hop right into. i expect the PVE RP server for classic may have stuff like this going on too, i know a lot of RPers on these servers have talked about RPing in classic so this format may end up the norm as well. if anyone rolls RP to avoid streamers, remember to be mindful of those RPing!
---
One Oceanic PvP server lmao it's gonna be a bloodbath. My body is ready.
---
Sounds like people who complain about Warlords of Draenor and how they felt trapped in their garrisons printing gold. You choose to stay in one place and kill the same respawning mob.
---
Why are streamers going east coast, arent they cali based?
---
"less XP" is a bit of an understatement. Your XP plummeted when you entered a raid.
---
There will be no official Method guild, they didn't announce anything about playing/raiding on classic servers.
---
I only noticed it in the 1-5 zone, and as Blizzard have stated themselves, this is how it worked in vanilla. I don't think chests are even affected by dynamic spawns anyway so that'd happen regardless.
---
What say you Bobby B?
---
oh, neat. i dont remember Thalnos and i never saw naxx in classic or WOTLK so that explains that. 
---
thx for the info.
---
I believe you're default friendly with your whole faction
---
Are you 40 in arcane?
---

---
Ahh 1.12 only has 5 min buffs
---
how do i get on that discord? I want to confirm this
---
Warlock can‚Äôt summon you alone.
---
Also, using lower rank of spell is a thing.
---
Welcome to WoW. :D
---
Ah yes the blanket "no changes herp derp". Thank you for your contribution.
---
Everyone would benefit from this. No one with a functioning brain wants one or two people to store a guild's materials and items. It's a huge security concern. GMs and officers can easily just bounce to another guild, or off realm, just as they did in vanilla.
---
Kapp
---
Either shit post or your brain no work no good
---
So we did a few runs of this using spirit rez's and the shaman quest path and got it down to 14 minutes. If you'd like I can show you on the stress test server!
---
Wait are talents not trees anymore? How do they work?
---
Remember all the times they told you that removing layering by phase 2 was actually the worst case scenario? Their goal was actually to have it removed asap, but at the very latest by phase 2.
---
I understand your argument, but that's the point of layering. Instead of migrating realms together they're going to use layering to have more players on the same realm. If the two month mark population dies down they just remove layers. Same players on the same server with the same economy, instead of mashing two separate servers together. They can also remove layers ahead of time, or keep layers past phase 2 if necessary but they've said they don't want to do that.
---
You're in for a big surprise.
---
Ha, I thought Something Awful
---
Meeting Stones. Only Warlocks summon ;)
---
then name reservation is just a trick to get paid 2 weeks earlier
---
i like very very large cities with just super tiny centers where you do your work. boralus is a good example of packed center but large city.
---
i also like it as a devlopment things where you have this super large city with closed doors everywhere and reused buildings and over time diffrent devs gets an idea of a shop or RP location they want to make with a new house so they make it and eventually you have a super detailed city with all of these tiny hand crafted things for people to find.
---
i remember going down with my warlock into the warlock training area you can keep going down and the entire thing just massiv and it just has nothing there things like that was super cool to find
---
Well, the dynamic respawn or (spawn threshold) was a part of the 2004-2006 version of WoW as well, so it's not like it is a feature ported from modern wow.

Cool, thanks. Are you going to pop us on the post?

There are quite a few CVARS you can boost to make it even crazier (add them to your config.wtf file):

---
    SET farclip "10000"

    SET horizonStart "10000"

    SET groundEffectFade "500"
---
    SET doodadLodDist "1500"    
---
Just beware, your CPU will be able to cook a pizza, but OH MY GOD.
---
Shaz-rah... I mean... it's not... hard
---
Ohh i see
---
No it's not, literally all they have to do is just implement one or two extra servers.
---
Like others mentioned this is stated how it worked in vanilla. I'm not positive though the stress test matched that.
---
&gt;are we gonna end up playing on like 100 different "servers" instead of just... 100 servers?
---
This is such a cute moment. You guys finally figured it out. It took you like 3 months but you finally realise why layering is necessary! I'm so proud of y'all.
---
Yeah they should remove the dynamic respawns from starting zones, which was present in vanilla, because new characters ought to have to spend more time waiting around
---
At that the same time though, that's what keeps that class fun and interesting for a long time.
---
&gt;It's not about stream snipers, they know those are unavoidable. It's about the 1000s of trolls who are going to try and steal their names on every server. They should probably just pick one now anyway since I really doubt they win the race to get their names reserved.
---
They'd be stupid if they are holding out for that reason. They only have a few options to go with anyway.
---
On my first server the second r14 had just gotten to motorcycle accident so he had time. I just can't remember was he paralyzed or just temporaly bed ridden.
---
&gt; I'm going to be playing a Tauren Shaman and want to quest with my friends who are playing an orc and a troll. I heard there is a quick way through the shaman path quest, but wasn't sure what that meant.
---
‚Äã
---
&gt; Otherwise I was just going to walk there and collect flight paths since it should only take 25 minutes or so.
---
Fastest way would be the eastern road out of Mulgore, follow road east then north to Crossroads, north out of Crossroads until the road splits, take the eastern road unto Durotar. Once in Durotar take the road east to Razor Hill, take the road south out of Razor hill and just stay on it. It will curve west and end up in the Valley of Trials. 
---
But to be honest, I'd just level in Mulgore to get the Thunder Bluff rep to make your mount cheaper.
---
Yeah i never got around to testing it on the beta. I just assumed thank you for clarifying.
---
Exactly. second best chance is the naxx boss. 
---
i'll be safe on that SM boss server or w/e.
---
There's a thing called server merge that Blizzard often use when servers become dead, ever heard of it?
---
So, you want us to play under 3998938 layers and the whole experience will feel like a cross-server shit just because Blizzard doesn't know what the fuck they're doing.
---
Yes but also no, at least not until the first onyxia kill and head turn in so don't expect one until the diehard's get the kill and then hope your inside the the city when the buff gets applied.
---
So you hate streamers but still watch them? lol, can you point me towards these clips? I'm sure Asmon might have said stuff like it, but his whole gimmick is being the big bad streamer man, and you guys are playing completely into his hands lmfao.
---
I don't really watch any of the big streamers, or many streams at all, this anti streamer circlejerk is just so dumb. 
---
Streamers are far down on the list of things that could fuck up classic. Too few servers/layers for ever/leeway/spellbatching are all much more potentially gamebreaking
---
Fairbanks and Thalnos are were they AREN'T rolling.

i mean old Orgimmar dose the have bank roof where all the cool kids hang out.

Eh no, if you ever want a glimpse of world pvp you have to be on a pvp server.
---
Oh, that's cool!
---
Truer words were never spoken. I should never have mentioned phases!
---
Well alright then.
---
Let's be fair, the only ones who ever complained about that stuff is the DE/FR crowd. We had no one demanding tongue-clicking servers before they came out and said no DE/FR servers, and when they changed their mind and added DE/FR, we still have no one demanding tongue-clicking servers. The xenophobic french and german populations fucked all of EU on this, they better fucking show up in force and make use of those 4 servers they're calling dibs on, or I'll start getting real mad.
---
It sounds very Alaskan.
---
Alliance guild of no-lifers who will ruin the experience of horde players. Our guild is avoiding them like the plague.
---
Turns out the locked servers were the ones used for the stress test.
---
I have some from the beta on my PC, but am away from my home until next week and forgot to make sure Teamviewer was running &gt;.&lt;
---
Some of those CVARS increase object clutter, but most increase the view distance on objects, so in your screenshots the difference wouldn't be that awesome. But when you go to a place like Thunder Bluff and can see literally EVERYTHING in Mulgore from one spot... it almost makes you want to roll a Tauren, almost.
---
It 100% does not.
---
isnt there a limit on name reserves? anyone know?
---
Avoid the streamer one. Whatever one they choose, choose the opposite.
---
Okay so tell me how many percent of the EU population does the UK have?
---
My guild will be on fairbanks but its not 100% certain they aren't there until they actually aren't.
---
&gt; then name reservation is just a trick
---
You're paying to reserve your name? What is the trick here?
---
I mean I totally agree, but its also in a lottery winners best interest to not develop a drug habit or give money away to "relatives" coming out of the woodwork, but take a gander at the statistics involving lottery winners and being broke within 5 years.
---
After the 50th time someone opens that trade window with 100+g or a bunch of mats in it for free, your willpower might crack.
---
I've heard rumours that streamers will in fact get advance access, because they are first class citizens.
---
Most of them love PvP and it's content. PvE will be boring af.
---
Damn bruh you arcane as helllll
---
You stretch the playerbase regardless but hear this out. If it seems it isn't a prolem to have this many servers then nothing has to be spread out. It will only be added for needed servers. How can you possible know how many servers you need extra without cutting it too thin? I think it's 100% better to start out this way then randomly have 5 too many servers be dead at after a month.
---
There will 100% be streamers on the RP-PvP server, but their community isn't toxic or full of fanboys.
---
Looking at your badge. Maybe listen to someone who has a record being right about stuff lol. Mob tagging was part of Vanilla and you can just inv people to share the mobs.. It might have been, but surtainly not the way I experianced it. I could clear the Spider cave and walk out of it. Or in the Barrens I needed to go to the next spot. At the white Lion... They just kept spawning over and over, go check the kodo skeleton.

You realize there is a different between the random shit people did in 2004 vs the power streamers have over a server population today right?  
---
The 1000 Soda fanboys are gonna be at his beck and call
---
Undeads are neutral with the others, I believe.
---
I agree with you that just a fraction of players who are waiting for classic participate in beta or stress test ... yet they release so few servers is they didn't expect much more players than in these tests
---
"Right - click report this guy that killed me!"

Boom, 20,000 children report you and you're banned for 30 days for 'harassment and stream-sniping'.

I just think it's funny that I haven't been hearing anyone mention Towelliee, even though he's going to play classic. His channel still gets 2k people, but I never hear anyone talk about him here.
---
It's definitely a much worse UI than the Vanilla -&gt; WotLK versions.
---
WeakAuras also has a god-awful UI on Classic compared to retail.
---
Seems like alliance are all going Pagle... no way my names will be available. Oh well. See you boys there.

I agree

Not allowing faction transfers is a good start.

We're on the east coast unfortunately, but good luck to you!

3.5k was vanilla full server.

Oh yeah? What record setting games have you made?

I'm strictly talking about dueling and flagging - I.E. you choosing. If he doesn't want to be corpse camped he shouldn't be on a pvp server.

WoW launched in America with 43 PVP servers back in 2004.......
---
......
---
When the games population was GROWING, not SHRINKING.
---
Roll Alliance on PvE and Horde on PvP. Sorted.
---
As an East Coaster, idgaf. There's an RP-PvP server and I'm rolling on it.
---
the servers have a 10,000 player cap now instead of 2,000 so they are much more capable than in 2004
---
Good point
---
Enslave us again, and we will.
---
Aren't they going pacific?
---
I spent 30 minutes trying to get into a cave. Couldn't do it because the mobs respawned faster than I could kill them.
---
it is 206 alliance 209 horde at the moment :D
---
She is mad cuz the scope she made for G√≠ml√≠√≠'s gun keeps falling apart.
---
In short, it really depends on what you find the most fun. Do you want to spend the majority of your time pvping? Pick a hunter or rogue. You don‚Äôt need to be an Arena WCS proplayer to sit an orc rogue in the wetlands and hunt people down and have some fun.
---
Mage was my first pick until I realised I will be spamming frostbolt and drinking every other mob until 60. Really boring to level. Good utility but you don‚Äôt get portals until much later on. Always nice to have in a group but aren‚Äôt necessary. Also good in duels but I think mages are overrated in organised group PvP. Especially once warriors and rogues gear up in the later stages! That being said, mages will be insanely popular and are great at gold farming. 
---
I picked hunter because I also have limited play time and they breeze through levelling. Which also allows me to enjoy it more and lore it up! Their rotation can be interesting, weaving in spells between auto shots. I like the RPG elements to being a beast master hunter. Hunting and taming pets. Looking for rares and unlocking new pet skills. Different pets for different situations... Fun mini games to me! I also think *good* hunters are respected a lot and are highly sought after. Hunter, if played right, have reliable CC, can kite mobs forever if a dungeon pull goes sideways, have good damage in the early phases too. 
---
If you‚Äôre still undecided, I would probably suggest a priest. That would be my second pick. They are surprisingly good at PVE with wand spec and the odd spell cast. Really mana efficient if managed properly. Highly desired by everyone in PvP and pve. People will befriend you instantly. Shadow priests are fun in PvP and from memory, they are decent at farming too. Granted not as good as hunter or mage early on but every class has that problem
---
Just my two cents. I‚Äôm sure some might disagree!
---
Esfand confirmed that the streamer server will not be Fairbanks, so that's where I'll be
---
Well Golemagg lmao
---
They're expecting a large amount of people to drop off after the initial hype. It's really not that insane... Time will tell whether or not Blizzard was correct but I'd really rather not have a bunch of dead servers after 6 months.
---
I was hoping you'd post an ally version too. I love the perspective that you used and the squirrels on the nelf (and the gradient in her hair) are a neat touch.
---
Please make more of these!
---
More like 10 people who actually bother to get to level cap and help him, which they would probably be guildmates anyways. The 100 who after a week go their own way and play the game by themselves or with friends, then the 890 who don't even get to level 10 and don't play after a week
---
It surtainly did not. Like I mentioned above. At the white lion kodo skeleton for instance. You simply cannot clear them. It might be the best farming spot for that lvl in the game. The system looked broken and inconsistent to me and needs to be fixxed before launch. I loved the test, but critisism is more important now.
---
If you could figure out the energy bar tick, that would be amazing
---
Makes sense. South Koreans famously hate competitive PvP games. There is no carbon monoxide leak at Blizzard HQ.

---
blizzard dont expect more than 18k to play on the english servers after phase 2. 3k pop per server is what the game is designed for

Also WoW Classic probably wouldn't exist if Blizzard didn't know they'd get free advertising for it.

Used car salesman: *slaps Herod on the helm*
---
‚ÄúYou can fit so many f*cking Streamers in here‚Äù
---
Fairbanks is confirmed by Esfand to be safe for non-streamers
---
&gt;They don't want to have to merge realms down the road, so layering the launch and the first couple of months of gameplay probably seemed like the most reasonable solution to them.
---
But you're already deviating from what Ion claimed the purpose of layering was. It wasn't to be the first couple of months, it was until phase 2 **at worst**. He said they wanted to get rid of it ASAP, but with this tiny number of servers even removing it at the start of phase 2 seems naive. You're making a dichotomy of making a lot more servers and having them abandoned, but what about just maybe 4-6 EU PvP servers? That's 4-6x 3-4k players, doubtful they'll have to merge those particularly early even if dropoff is massive, and it'd cut down on the need for layers and thus reduce the time needed before layering can be removed. Which is in accordance with their stated intent.
---
Just removed the word "original" for accuracy, but Dire Maul will be available at launch, so my point stands.
---
Duh?
---
I liked this until the bonus
---
The English servers are going to be a fkin disaster, literally every language other than Russian, German and French will congregate there and won't be able to understand what anyone says...
---
Honestly don't know why I'm worried, I'm from the EU lol
---
I think they have the numbers to make an approximation on how many servers they will need. 
---
It won't be hard or difficult for them to add new servers, and rerolling after a couple of days won't be that big of a deal, especially with the prospect of a "new" server to play on. 
---
The bigger issue is the reality of ghost servers if they add too many. Humans are weird and unpredictable. What if the population breakdown happens as the following:
---
Server A: 60%
---
Server B: 10%
---
Server C: 10%
---
Server D: 10%
---
Server E: 10%
---
Which is possible, right? What if, for whatever reason, the majority of people decide that the populated Server A is the one they want to play on. Those other 4 servers will become ghost towns. 
---
Start small and then players can distribute themselves more easily and in a more controlled manner. From there adding the right amount of servers becomes easy, and better for the longevity of the game.
---
I'm sure you think rogue/mage is the only viable DPS pre naxx too? Min/maxing a 15 year old game is going to be a bad time bud.
---
Great tips!
---
The bonus part is a myth, a false rumor and a scam. Those who believe it shall be punished.
---
LOL imagine genuinely thinking this. Jfc, grow up.
---
Yeah, I kind of agree in hindsight but it's rare to see Vanilla players care about others first. I haven't been following the Streamer community, but I know some Vanilla players can be quite toxic, so while it wasn't of any surprise that they ruled out an RP-PvP server, the way he worded it made him gain my respect.
---
Why does US vs EU regions effect choice?
---
Same answer.
---
Widepeepohappy
---
It‚Äôs better to have to add servers than it is to delete them.
---
I think you mean ratchet. booty bay is a hike.

Both are full of self important "celebrities" who make money for basically existing.
---
For the Horde!
---
Totally agree
---
Thank you for the response! I don't expect I'll be much of a raider (I suck) so hopefully it's all a non issue for me!
---
Sounds like your french Canadian.
---
Or naming one of them Nostalrius, since they started this big push for Classic. Yeah there were plenty of pservers before it but that server is the one that finally pushed it over the edge.
---
it's these kind of people that praise blizzard for layering
---
god I disgust BFA normies
---
Imagine falling for such obvious fake bait just because it's aimed at pservers.
---
You only get three total.
---
Just out of curiosity. Why is everyone trying to avoid this admon guy. 
---
Here from r/all I used to play but the name doesn‚Äôt ring a bell.
---
can we get a ban on this fucktard
---
To be fair, they were sort of caught between a rock and a hard place as there was so much backlash against the idea of not having language specific servers. Although I agree, there should be more than 2 english PvP servers.
---
And the mailboxes you can dance on.
---
&gt; I feel like I should defend SA players because not everyone is a bad player or do dumb stuff
---
As a normally reasonable person, I would of course think that's the case. As someone who has played wow for over a decade and had many interactions with SA servers like Ragnaros, Nemesis, Gallywix, etc., I have not had a single positive experience with SA players that didn't leave me thinking "Are they all morons?"
---
That's me
---
Fake bait? Fake?
---
No? Lol
---
Keep in mind that the majority of the people that will actually play classic won't participate in polls like these &amp; people who participate are more likely to be more hardcore, more competetive, and thus, far more PvP focused than your average Joe or Hans.
---
I chose my words carefully
---
Man that really sucks.. Fuck those guys
---
Hahahhaha.... /r/ClassicWoW isnt trying to pose itself as and official reddit... that's completely different!
---
Then don't do it. It's our choice to waste money if we want. I'd rather there not be enough servers than have there be too many lol.
---
Wish it was to level 20 so Alliance had a better shot at doing DM
---
This. They could double the amount of servers for day 2 effortlessly if needed. Closing and merging servers does huge damage to the community. Being conservative is by far the most intelligent option.
---
Thanks! hopefully the ratings this time are more accurate, clearly I missed a bit on priest :P
---
lmao, sounds amazing.
---
But that's not accurate. This isn't supposed to be patch 1.12, this is supposed to be as close to the authentic vanilla experience as possible while using patch 1.12 as a base.
---
Those are not at all the same thing.
---
You now ‚Äúlock‚Äù into a specific trees, and rather than spending points, you choose one of 3 (or 4?) abilities per level ‚Äútier‚Äù. So if I was a feral Druid, I‚Äôd only have access to feral Druid spells, and I‚Äôd select a new ability at levels 10, 20, 40, 90, etc. from the talent tab (those aren‚Äôt the actual levels, just wanted to illustrate the tiers). 
---
That‚Äôs way changing spec is so easy, because otherwise you‚Äôd never get to access the rest of your class.
---
It would be the german forums &gt;_&gt;
---
Yeah sorry man Thalnos is a South American server now. I‚Äôd rather play with streamers at that point
---
I don't know if agree that they excel in dungeon tanking...
---
Yeah they can do it, but not having a taunt and drinking after every other pull makes somewhat rough
---
Source? There isn't anything currently in the rules against it.

One of the most enjoyable experiences I had in early wow was running scholomance and stratholme as a guild with 15 players all cramming into it.  It was so much fun back in those days before the fun police started putting limits on everything.

---
Why do I remember this being a thing. I‚Äôve even heard other people talk about it but with my like 5 minutes of research everywhere says it‚Äôs not a thing.

nah, "dead server" is what happens when a person cares more about an arbitrary population number than they do engaging with other humans on the server
---
Yep
---
üòÇüëå lit

Did you not notice that each server for FR/DE came out of the pool for all EU servers? You got 4 servers for DE/FR, which cost us 4 servers for literally every single other country in Europe, and you're still not happy because your alts? Thanks, I guess.
---
Eternity in pvp
---
PogChamp times a BILLION
---
One thing I forgot early on, is that while mana replenishes quickly, on a new server there's very little +int gear. In early levels, that means you might only get off 3 or 4 spells before you OOM. Add in a resist or two (fairly common early in the game) and now you're running for your life.
---
I made it to level 5 before dying, and that was an accomplishment!
---
I wasn't holding my breath given that after 15 years we don't even have any RP servers on retail. I'm not going to give up the chance to play with 30 ms for RP though.
---
I‚Äôve been playing at 125ms from NA to a server overseas and it‚Äôs quite responsive IMO. I don‚Äôt notice any lag at all.
---
Ya that will be my server I think
---
Players are older now and cant spend the same amount of time messing around. My guild friends(9 will all play classsic ) conists of players abovew 40 yo.Me and my brother are the youngest ones(31 and 25 resspectively) they will all play PVE..they dont have the time for endlesss Wpvp

I think you misunderstood. I am not going to trade my gold across servers.

Everytime something is posted, people just like to piss and shit all over it. You don't think that developers, game masters, server people (whichever people are in charge of data) havent looked at whats to be expected and whats to come out off the re-release of Classic? 
---
Its like most of you assume this is being run by people that have no experience in the MMO-market, that havent played any MMO's. If Blizzard thinks this is for the best, it probably is. And for the record, I'm not some naive fanboy that supports them all the way. But between this and all the hating on realm names, it's just stupid.
---
They can add realms if needed. You know what's gonna happen if they start off with 43 pvp servers? People will drop off, and in 3-5 months time there will be a ton of posts saying:'Omg Blizzard fucked up servers' or 'How could they have not see this coming?!'. Just actually think about all these stupid posts you're writing and stop assuming. They have so much information they can tap in, 15 years of information. The only thing we see is nothing basically. 
---
Honestly, if some of you people would've been wow classic developers, this game would've been dead before it even started.
---
Realms are up for those already online, just can't log in. (I'm logged in now)

same situation. I logged when the Disconnected from Blizzard Services message came up. Can't log back in but my roommate never logged and is still playing just fine. Really hope this gets fixed quickly.

Classic is based on patch 1.12.  That means stuff like this is NOT going to be recreated.  Talents and other changes that were that were how things were  before 1.12  are not going to be in the game.

Thalnos was my server of choice, cool name and no streamers, until it became the unofficial latin american server. Fuck that id rather risk being on the streamer server
---
You never look for players for just Dire Maul. It's always DM N, W, E or Tribute. There's no way to get confused.
---
Sure but he is quickly amassing a larger following and being close to asmon and other distasteful streamers is only going to soil his fan base too.
---
Hmm, I somewhat thought the Priest selections were absolutely spot on in the first place :P
---
He tried to present himself as this wealth of knowledge and enthusiast of classic and then classic beta came around and he would say things were bugs when they weren't and just over all didn't seem to understand what he was doing. Don't even get me started on his reactions, any time they announce anything about classic no matter how small of a thing it is he has to make a 15 minute video where he seems to be almost in tears because they announce something like stress tests.
---
Its all part of the adventure!

Lol that's a lot of ~~shit~~ er... poor!

Ps: great work, love these and cant wait for druid!!

You should use this as an opportunity to evaluate how you treat people instead of pretending that your incivility and insults and mod removed comments has anything to do with my ego.

So, decided to try something new instead of banging my head on Arch for the weekend to get fully running again.  I went ahead and picked up Manjaro in KDE Plasma flavor.  So far its not bad, its going to take me a bit of time to shed off years of Debian command habits... but the change is nice.  Might play with retail wow for a while and see how it runs compared between Majaro and Mint.

Look around in the sub, someone posted a video calling for the RP-PVP server and they had some info in there. Basically expect a stronger community, more serious faction pride (like obviously we're for the horde or alliance but on an RP server of any type usually people are more passionate about it in the sense that it ties into their character's backstory or whatever). World events are a big thing, too. If you're respectful of people who are RPing and you're not a griefer you may enjoy it!
---
I mean, I have to admire the guy's resolve (in WoW, not business administration). He's millions of dollars in debt, gets doxxed every day, has just as many, if not more, haters as he does fans, and yet has still seen fairly admirable success and never seems to doubt himself despite all of the above. He's still a douche, but he's not defeated.
---
My logical brain says that people currently trade gold between realms and people trade gold between Runescape 3 and Old School Runescape all the time.

This is a great chance for people to experiment with race/class combos. Thanks Blizz!

I used to raid top 10 in the world on an east coast server from Cali. Wow doesn‚Äôt really require high ping like an FPS. One thing you can do in the settings is setup spell queuing? Where it will queue your spells to offset lag.

Another thing is it will only be about 70-90 ms. Which is still super playable, especially when the combat is a bit slower.

Some of them are back up.
---
You mean like buying Classic gold with Retail Gold?
---
God I fucking hope not
---
Download Classic client and jump in.
---
Im completely fine with how in treating You, and you have no clue how i threat other people even tho you also made up in your own mind that You do.
---
not having a taunt and having a mana bar really puts a big hamper on them thats for sure :(
---
THIS
---
Where have you seen that? Want to keep up to date on that myself.
---
Hopefully whoever does this gets insta banned.
---
Go google how an economy works. If it still doesn‚Äôt make sense, just smile nice and big and drop your application off at McDonalds on the way out the door
---
To be fair this does seem to be classic!Blizz‚Äô modus operandi lately, I think you might be right
---
Ah excellent! Well considering that the classic stress test has been extended I might have to give the shadow priest a try and see if I like it. Thanks again Mugungo
---
How would I go about doing that? I‚Äôm a total noob lol
---
You're really really dumb if you think the population of UK is the only segment of people in the EU who communicate in English online. Just saying.
---
Fuck yeah man
---
lok'tar ogar brother
---
you just unlocked the ‚Äòtwitch streamer defender‚Äô badge which will now appear beside your name in twitch chat. congrats!
---
I mean Esfand is actually friends with and plays with Asmon/Soda. Tips and Staysafe are definitely wannabe's, and Esfand has a bigger following than both of them.
---
He's also cool and has at least semi-interesting content unlike the other two.
---
Retail bad
---
Classic good
---
I agree, but its currently not against the rules and its common in Runescape.
---
they did?
---
Gold means wayyy more in Classic.
---
Endgame economy is huge because mats needed for raiding.
---
If someone can just get the gold needed without contributing to the economy then it‚Äôs gonna ruin it
---
Undead female rogue/warrior doing front flip every special attack is best animation in game melee wise. Orcs shoot bows properly, trolls hip fire so thats up to you if hunter. I like orc casting animations but not significant difference there
---
Quick reminder that us "pissing and shitting" all over everything made blizzard realise they had to add RPPVP servers and specific language servers in EU. You have way too much trust in this company.
---
Waiting for the alliance version  ‚Äú wow vc is so hard in classic unlike RETAIL‚Äù
---
do you need a beta invite or is it just a test server, also it says i need active game time?
---
Inc 20k queue on english pvp eu.
---
ok thanks, i found the settings. I guess the drag to move just isn't working
---
He also announced realms that they will 100% not be on, so if you have a hardon for avoiding streamers at all costs, you now have 2 options for streamer free PvP realms.
---
The latter for sure, which will make the former more likely after a while.
---
WHAT?!?!?!?!
---
Thank you, Blizzard!  OMG thank you so much!

You are unbelievable. Love it.
---
On the battle.net app, select World of Warcraft, then just above the big PLAY button is a drop-down menu to change your version. Change it from the normal "World of Warcraft" to "World of Warcraft Classic". It will then prompt you to download the game (it's only a few gigs, not huge) then you're good to go.
---
It was uncovered by a sleuth in serenity now and posted to the now defunct illidrama.com
---
Not sure why it sounds like bullshit, considering no one related to fayejin was ever interviewed.
---
Your point being?

I mean you could add something akin to the Darkmoon Faire for cheesy aesthetic pieces, but you're talking about entire dungeons/raids? That's preposterous, especially when we take into consideration the alternative, which is TBC. 
---
If you have two options sitting on a table, one being Vanilla 1.5 with an extra dungeon that only drops aesthetic content, and the other is TBC servers, which makes more sense?
---
The reason you need a high level for tier4 is because the distance between a Tier 1 level 60 and Tier 3 is already massive, nearly gamebreaking massive. I mean Tier 3 gear is so good that you basically are already a higher level. To have gear extend past that would completely destroy the balance of the game. You'd literally have to have a separate BG bracket for players with a certain iLevel. From a game design perspective, any meaningful content (dungeons/raids) is not reasonable. Especially so when considering the clear alternative.
---
Holy shit you're worrying about this waaaaayyy too much.  You won't notice the difference between 30ms and 32ms.
---
it was never a thing. anyone who ever said it was a thing is a god damn liar.
---
You'll find plenty of normal guilds too. I always play on rp servers for the perks. People rping around me, immersive chats, good rp clothes on the AH cheaper rhan most servers because of demand, proper names (tbh not all names are super creative fantasy names but the only person i knew who had to have a forced name change was originally xxpoonslayerxx. He changed it to Pancakess and hes still using that one. You just have more decent names than other servers). 
---
Ive never really gotten into rp myself but i once saw a guy get mugged by some defias brotherhood rogues in SW and that was cool. If you do end up in an rp guild embrace it. If you dont know what youre doing ask someone. Let them know youre wanting an out of character whisper convo if its a serious rper.
---
When you choose realm, go to Classic and download client. Bottom-leftish I believe on the web battle.net , of the Wow tab
---
not to mention being a fraud in real life as well. google a bit.
---
Well in that case hope the choices arent final. All around feels like a small number of servers to be releasing at all.
---
That's legit what I thought it was when I first saw someone share that pic.  lol
---
Why wouldn‚Äôt someone want to play on a server with a streamer? Legit question.
---
Devilsaur Mafia, shady private server players.
---
Any subscriber and participate.
---
There‚Äôs me!
---
On the Blizzard launcher, switch from retail to Classic on the little box above the PLAY button and download the game.
---
No idea, it wasnt until TBC when Priests got mass dispel, we could finally say 'fuck you!' to Paladins, ha.
---
In the Blizz launcher, go to WoW, then click the arrow to the right of where it says, "World of Warcraft" (above the 'Play' button).  Select "World of Warcraft Classic," then it the 'Play' button should change to 'Install.'
---
Should be all set after that.
---
Twitter + coke = server reveal
---
Insulting people oof
---
Why do so many people who complain here and never heard of layering get all the +karma
---
How sheltered you gotta be to take offense from something insignificant and commonplace
---
Ruining the economy isn't going to stop people from doing it though.
---
Why the hell would they use non-Warcraft names for realms?
---
I guess so I admit I am wrong. Playing a priest anyway but good to know. Ty for the correction
---
[This is a translation of the interview](https://www.rvgm.com/news/the-players-enthusiasm-for-the-world-of-warcraft-classic-is-unexpected.html).
---
&gt; Compared with the original version, what technical updates does Classic have?
---
&gt; We used the updated server code. The original server can hold 3,000 people in one area, but now it can exceed 10,000. For example, if you encounter hundreds of people in the wild, it may be difficult to run the server in the past, but the new server will not have too many problems.
---
Unless the Twitch streamer I was listening to translate that entire video was just making stuff up, there was definitely a mention of 10,000 players on a server at one time. It was kind of just dropped in. I was mistaken that it was John Hight that said it (he doesn't speak Mandarin), but I'm also not the only one on this sub that confirmed it. I'm digging through my history now to find it, but I may have been in Incognito.
---
So ... If Blizzard is smart about this, they will gather and check their data on how many players participated in the stress tests in Europe and from which country they are. Based on that data they can then extrapolate how many servers for which regions they need to set up.
---
P.S.: German here, will most likely want to roll on English server, too.
---
Nah hes just thinking big haha
---
&gt;the economy will be a complete shitshow.
---
Is the economy layer-specific? I think the rest of your post is bang-on, but I don't think the economy will be affected as long as each layer has the same auction house.
---
Awesome, thank you!
---
Live in Texas my whole life and never heard anyone call it the DPS though
---
I'd say it's one of the most wholesome memes ever. Like the homemade potato chips of memes.
---
Even gold farmers have to contribute to the economy for gold tho
---
Great... I'm guessing eventually one set of "officials" will win out
---
Didn't know about that, and is probably more than I care to know about honestly.
---
Least played  non  meme  class is warlock and easiest to get tier gear but you compete w mages and even healers for many pieces.
---
Usually only like 3 locks in a raid.
---
Yeah cringe incarnate. I hope there is a bloodbath somewhere when I die, give me a good send off to Valhalla, honoring me with blood and Glory.
---
Select wow classic in the rolldown menu on the battlenet launcher. Hit install and you're good to go.
---
Not with 400ms spell batching  you won't
---
As for advertising I think the amount they've done so far makes sense so far. It's been mentioned at every gaming event Blizzard has gone to, it was pushed really hard on twitch, they've had some twitter, facebook, and apparently linkedin advertising. That reaches out to all the people who are going to get hyped and invested long term. Keep in mind that it still really only makes sense to spend money on the game if you're invested enough to reserve a name. I would be surprised if we didn't see more internet ads, maybe even on youtube, in the week or two right before launch. Anything longer than that and the average person isn't going to stay interested long enough to come back and spend money on it on launch day.
---
You're also right about the direction that "Modern MMO design" is going in. However, as a business, WoW classic, OSRS, and other such games show there is a demand for that older style game. If WoW classic is able to capture a significant portion of that audience, an audience immune to the charms of the modern MMO design, and charge them $15/mo + expansions then it makes financial sense to try to keep a hold of that market by producing more content in the style it enjoys. In order for that to happen, Classic does actually need to be pretty successful. At least a couple hundred thousand subscribers.
---
I personally think the most likely course of events is that WoW classic will have some players, but not quite enough, and they'll go on to release TBC and Wrath but I am hoping to be wrong. I would definitely buy another expansion for Classic if the content was right.
---
Add in a death spirit rez once you enter the north barrens for a much quicker travel to Xroads.
---
Warriors get Mortal Strike at 40. It‚Äôs a talent, so no gold cost, but kind of a big deal for sure :)
---
If you need to be hostile just for the sake of it, that's your battle. It doesn't matter whether you think that nolifing is pathetic, what matters is that nolifers can affect your gameplay experience. I'm sure that if you like what the game is about, you will enjoy it regardless of whether you play on an APES server or not. I do think that playing on a server without APES is more enjoyable, but you do you.
---
yeah, my West Coast guild is leaning towards Fairbanks as well.
---
Only need to have gametime.
---
Nope not really. Saying they 'excel' in dungeons is incredibly kind. Some players *may* put up with a pally tank *some* of the time. They can aoe farm lowbie dungeons sure (if they somehow piece together a good block/sp set), but that's hardly a very useful or impressive skill.
---
It's just a test server yes. Don't need an invite but you do need a subscription.
