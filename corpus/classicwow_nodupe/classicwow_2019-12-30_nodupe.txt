You are missing the point. If a server has 100 druids and 1000 warriors it is more likely that the 2 best warriors out of those are more skilled than the 2 best druids.

---
You know he’s not actually wearing the set you see, and is using an add on, right?  R13 is mathematically impossible at this point.
---
I just hit the honored area and still have a loooong way to go. However, if it's still a lose every game when I hit exalted, I probably won't play it much anymore
---
And what are the rules? Do Mages get Cold Snap every single duel? Because that tilts everything in favor of Mages over Shaman.
---
These players are in a different level duel wise, go watch the vods of cdew dueling, it's crazy.
---
How about just doing it in the first place and being grateful anyone reminded them at all? 
---

---
People need others to remember for them and must be respectful while doing so to ensure reciprocity? 
---
Ppl are awful
---
Same way you buy drugs. You know a guy
---
Your skepticism seems to be based on your lack of understanding of the system.
---
Getting to R14 is solely based on playing more than everyone else, so someone that is currently playing more than 99.9% of the player base is going to hit R14. Unless that person changes how much they are playing, then yes they know they are going to hit R14.
---
I would love them to add in "classicified" classes that are locked behind end-game content. For example, I would really be interested in a classic version of the monk, since it would give unarmed skill a use and the heavy focus on auto attacks would really look great thematically for monks.
---
I’m confused how you’re correlating total population to you losing in a population controlled battleground. It’s 40v40 in AV. Faction imbalance has no factor, other than Alliance having instant queues allowing them to have premades.
---
Won*

Alliance on Skeram.  Despite being severely outnumbered the alliance coalition here is quite strong.  All of the bad players and casuals have transferred off but the good players and private server veterans stayed.  Skeram ally has two of the top 10 guilds in NA and 12/20 fastest clearing MC guilds here are ally.
---
This is just wrong. Enchanting can bring you lots of money. You gotta invest gold and time tho. 
---
But agree, tips got lower and lower,maybe because more people are getting the rare stuff.
---
But all in all i get minimum 2g tip for any enchant,i charge 5g for crusader and 15g for 30sp.
---
Anyway,altogether i think i made about 2k gold per tips by now (also invested about 1k for some formulas)
---
Some MMOs offer great WPvP but WoW isn't one of them.
---
got a prot warrior to boost for an hour in SM, got around 25k/hour exp, and thats around what grinding in the world would give, so a better booster is worth it, and you can relax while he run you through.
---
The re-enactment photo VERY closely resembles the original. Look at the foot placement, the angles, everyting - well done!
---
Of laughter maybe.
---
&gt;Stop judging others for wanting to rank. 
---
Why?  Honor farmers have ruined so much of this game for essentially no reason.  If you are one, kindly go fuck yourself off the tallest nearby building.
---
The best AFK farm would still be AV, so it would be exactly the same... unless you mean "I personally would be in WSG so I don't care"?
---
The current set of rules has to be the most arbitrary rule set I have ever seen. 
---
Hunters not being allowed to put traps down before duels is my favorite rule. It's just so Incredibly stupid. It's like saying locks can't have their pet out when the duel starts.
---
Mythic plus dungeons.  This is my favorite thing from Retail.
---
Damn I paid a fellow enchanter 25g just for the +4 to stats that shit is rare!!!
---
Yes but paladins shouldn't be able to roll on it because of the armor bit. Fucking give them hard prio on asscandy or whaetever you have to do to not let them take this one.
---
Negative resistances are the same as 0
---
It is legitimate, and how much gold you make depends on how efficient you get with it, but you can make 20-60g an hour.
---
until now it wasn't, but from the january championship phase it will be

This is what we started with and it's worked thus far. We clear MC and Ony every week in 3-4 hours since we only started at start of December.
---
I linked the rules if you want to read them. No they do not get cold snap every duel you are allowed 60 seconds between duels to rebuff/mana up. You can have a little more if you need it but unnecessary time wasting is not allowed. There is no way the judges would let a mage sit there for 10 minutes waiting for their next cold snap. Again please learn about what you're talking about before you talk about it I even linked the information you need.
---
I was referring to overall pvp effectiveness, power, abilities, etc... not the population.  oh well this post was removed by mods anyway
---
Jesus dude don't tell people to disenchant "of wrath" pieces. That's how you get lynched by warlocks/mages.
---
And the problem with that is that horde arent in a premadr fiscord. Getting anybody to help kill lieutenants is rare after balinda is dead. Easier to just play D and get honor from kills.
---
I mean, theoretically since you're filling both the tank and healer slot, you could fill the rest of the slots with dps? Probably need at least one off healer but... Mayyybe?
---
Were they actually queuing just WSG, or abusing the queue bug?
---
none of them really do, classic wow's is very okay when you have the proper server population, not these overpopulated classic megaservers.
---
Also paladins are easy to kill for warlocks compared to shamans (especially a good elemental shaman). Paladins are quite vulnerable to being feared , so you can take them out of the fight easily.  If paladins actually used shadow resistance aura it might make a difference but they never use it. A shaman on the other hand will always have tremor totems and grounding totems. I would say that neither of them are hard to kill solo but shaman's provide more annoyance in group situations.
---
[Here](https://cdl.gg/tournament/season-1-qualifiers/) is the result of the qualifiers. 64 competitors. 8 of every class. The top 4 of each class advanced to regular season. From that, the top 2 of each class advanced to the finals, which will be held in a few weeks.
---
What you just said is literally the opposite of an adaptation. If you change literally everything about the thing you're adapting, you're no longer adapting it. I bet you also thought the Netflix adaptation of Death Note was fine.
---
The number of ret pallies I've seen in AV with BRE makes my skin crawl...
---
A fury warrior in my guild is dual-wielding Deathbringers lmao, he just pulls aggro and dies. The 2nd one dropped during a holiday raid when the OT/other 1-H warriors weren't there.
---
Fuck that
---
&gt; nah. if the horde cap the GY hordes guard aggro every other time. dude got a huge aggro range. 
---
Not gonna doubt it happens at that point. Not sure why that becomes a problem though if that's the only reason the NPC is noteworthy... you know, after you've managed to secure the Alliance base for yourself.
---
&gt; if there's 35 people on O maybe. since horde have to send 15-20 back to D at minimum... no.
---
No, anytime I actually defend the base, it's lately been against 10-15 Horde or so. They burn down those NPCs in seconds while some are also still pushing forward. They're not that dangerous. Hell, I solo the Hordes ones when I'm on the lock.
---
&gt; says the guy who think horde have terrain advantage.
---
If you didn't have any terrain advantages, Rath Strat wouldn't work. The Horde defense I see in every AV game wouldn't work. But it does. If you don't want to accept Horde have some significant advantages on the map, that's all on you. Horde that reliably win though really don't want you in their games if you think you actually know better. You're just the equivalent of the Alliance that lose every game. You don't understand what's right in front of you.
---
You left off Deep Wounds, but otherwise the list looks about right.  I know some allow gift of Arthas, and being Horde you don't worry about Paladin Judgements. 
---
Somewhat depends on your number of Locks too. With 4+ Locks you should stop subbing in Agonies vs taking up 2 debuffs/lower dps raid slot with a second SPriest.
---
Just depends how sweaty you want to be.
---
I would even just settle for small tinkering updates like updates to the guild tab or quests added that reward an offence weapon that makes things like boomy viable
---
It is pretty similar so I would say it is on par
---
Very bad shadow priests are much lower than very bad locks and mages
---
average lock and shadow priest are equal, average mage is  higher than the 2 others
---
Good SP, mages and warlocks are on par
---
For the top 1% mage and locks are slitghly better than SP
---
better revamped honor system for classic+
---
remove battlegrounds
---
The main thing is that Alliance have an A and a B team right now.
---
A-team are premades formed by either server discords or cross-server discords aimed to make alliance get 8-10 min wins. (these premades have 95% winrate.
---
B team are all the rest, and not surprisingly this group of Solo-queue are getting shafted because they are denied teammates that are good.  (10-20% winrate).
---
It's a flaw in the system. Should Blizzard prevent the behavior? In my opinion yes.

You lose 20% of your rank points per week.

That's a meaningless statement cause everybody who PvPs has engineering.

But people still bitch about suboptimal specs and debuff slots. It's such a joke.

I've played on more of them than you id wager and for more time. Average and below guilds on classic today will not 1-2shot razor and wont be able to kill all adds in p1.

Grobbulus (if you're alliance)! As one metric, compare our discord and subreddit with others and see for yourself which better fits you. The first won't be until January 4 I believe, but there's a couple upcoming Grobbulus events posted on the discord that might be worth checking out if you're still undecided by then.

Stickyboard is not a RP friendly name

whats that
---
only if u enjoy not getting past rank 6
---
the elemental mastery combo is literally a 1.5s total cast. 
---
Are you saying that no one can get off a 1.5s cast in a 1v1
---
Elemental Mastery is not how you beat people 1v1. You want Nature's Swiftness for the instant heal. You have to make sure that you never eat a Counterspell, which means you can't cast, which means no heals without NS.
---
An honor system where you have to be good to get Rank 14? Downvoted! /s
---
[removed]
---
Horde perfection is winning with 4,5k bonus honor in 13 minutes. With HKs added you get about 10k/hour.
---
The short losses are decent but not something horde should try to have.  20minutes queue + 10 minutes in game it's 30min per 2772 (usually it's only 2,5k though) bonus honor, in short games you get very few kills and it doesn't amount to that much extra. That goes to 7k honor per hour which is OK but definitely not optimal.
---
A perfect victory is almost 6k bonus honor, a normal good one is around 4,5k. Add to that at least double the amount of honor from kills you would get your honor per hour goes up between even if matches take 20-40 minutes 8-10k.
---
this guy mind visions
---
Ehh you come off as a weirdo. You killed him a Couple times then they ganked you. That’s how it goes. 
---
Making a character to private message him is weird and then your 2v1 comment is passive aggressive and besides you’re a warlock in a 1v1 my man
---
Idk what you’re expecting lol
---
What do you mean? Ally can kill drek in 5 minutes or even less, horde cant really get Vann as fast. And if a premade is losing to 40 random people they're doing more than one thing wrong.
---
 numbers of horde n ally queueing doesn't change, so ratio of queuing time to av time doesn't change.
---
Yes it is, that looks like pretty much the outcome that everybody expected. Warlocks have no real weakness, warriors are decent but have the worst matchup in the game versus mages and shamans have a 40-60 matchup versus everything. If the only thing you hear about elementals is "wow, they have crazy crits" then thats a sign of an unreliable class (even with the one guaranteed crit every 3 minutes).
---
edit: also you're acting like this is a brandnew game and people haven't been theorycrafting it for 15 years, lol.
---
As alliance, about 7.
---
&gt;No way am I dropping 100g for a raid because other people can't learn their rotation or pay attention.
---
For a PUG sure, but I'd hope during guild progression you'd do your part otherwise you're the dead weight. And yes, plenty of guilds are still in progression. My guild has it on farm now so only the try hard dps are dropping the gold for consumes. But if you didn't have it in progression you were replaced.
---
You are already dead
---
*nani!?*
---
I had two Rank11 and a Rank13 in Vanilla and in Classic I capped out 5% before Rank6. I just can't do it. AV feels like a waste of my time, especially since I know I can just login once a Week like I'm doing since Month and keep collecting them PvE Epics that are way better anyways.
---
It gets alot better at 41 when you can get cons (11 points holy) aswell as Blessing of Sanctuary (21 points prot) :-) i quest fine, but push yourself using seal/judg of wisdom and all the fine protadin tools :)
---
Your character specific ID.
---
Definitely the look I have on my face when I sap my helpless victims lol.
---
They lost pretty much all matchup with rogues. Also warlock is a terrible matchup for a warrior.
---
If you're afking av in a WSG meta you're definitely not getting anywhere
---
Space is valuable.  I have alts outfitted with 14 slot bags filled with dreamfoil, elemental earth, elemental fire, etc.  All I’m saying is investing in elemental water is a mistake on both fronts.  Gold value and bag space value.
---
50 hours a week to spend in AV is not THAT extreme to you ?
---
That's help full. Thanks.
---
Twenty Four and Me.
---
And it's still happening today with all of the various Demon Hunters on Retail with some sort of Alt-character filled variant of the name Illidan. And not to mention all of the Arthas wannabe Death Knights back in the Wrath days...
---
The bad part is the ones who fall for this are probably engaging while the ones who don’t fall for it are actually AFK not doing anything
---
Oh come on now, no one goes through the trouble of making a new character on someone else's realm to "congratulate" them on killing you in PVP, you were being crazy passive aggressive and you know it, of course you're going to get a non-friendly response from them :P
---
Yes, melee weaving makes hunter the most engaging and indepth class. Even without its already one of the most engaging classes, pet management is all about keeping ur pet alive to maximize dps. Cool class for sure
---
POWERFUL WIZARDS IRL from vanilla days. Always cracked me up
---
Sounds like weeks griefing the open world was wasted, sorry for your loss.
---
the ratio might not change, but you spread out your play time over many short games instead of 1 long game.  and if you happen to get a short game while everyone else gets long games, you get the full effect of a long queue with no play time to compensate
---
Keep right... lawn mower? I don't get it :(

10 is faded gold and blue cloth.  14 is bright with white.

Asking the real questions.

Warrior burst with good gear and cooldowns is really strong.
---
They take 1 game against a lot of classes with that
---
Between the canyon and razor hill are a couple of farms. In one of the farms there's a mother looking for her son. You kill the crocs as part of the quest. And the drop rate can be really quick (first few crocs killed) or torturously long (hence the genocide).
---
For most scenes of carnage, this will be the reason. That or a rep grind 😜
---
But it's a sight of joy for a skinner heh
---
Nice. It always feels good to get that gear upgrade at 40
---
2hand fury is viable on horde, but as far as I know it doesn't really utilize slam much.

Wel that makes me happy. I know it’s good $ for sure, didn’t realize it was the best out there.

-give palys a taunt/crusader strike
---
Durid is 4 fite.
---
Running out before wrath is one way to do it. And probably he safest, but you don't have to send the melee out. As I said in the OP the main tank can taunt before wrath which means the melee just stay in and a few of them eat the knockback. Agrro reset happens to everyone, not just those who were knocked so other than some extra damage on those who got knocked, it's the same as having the melee stay in. He bonus is he melee can DPS the whole time.
---
It's not free. Bag space has a cost.
---
Lol should I feel sorry for no lifers not ranking because of botters? Or the botters for their eventual ban because they wanted to work around a stupid unhealthy system made by blizz?  Hmm let me think...nah. The pvp system is dumb and so is ranking. I don’t feel bad for any of you. Have fun lmao
---
It's a rule that makes no sense. You can see people coming in the open world or BGs and pretrap/flare.
---
&gt; Very nice to chain pulling while farming or fear kiting elites in open areas like winter spring.
---
Elites are one of the places I have found a use for Siphon Life, but in every day mobs it's very much not needed.
---
Is it 100g for any of the flasks? Thought some were cheaper. I know most people are farming mats instead of buying but I agree still ridiculous. Just the next level down elixir.
---
They "mow" the Horde at Balinda after hiding behind SHGY. Once the Horde are mowed down, the raid moves as one to RH, killing LTs on the way, skipping Galv. The group stops at TP to clear up any remaining LTs before moving to Drek's courtyard.
---
Check out the Fight Club warrior discord and ask it over there
---
Good, I hate that ability.
---
The kick back is a random 3 people. If you are the one of the lucky 3 then sucks for you. But no you dont have to move out as long as a tank stands in. We been doing it this way for weeks now. Makes the fight so much faster
---
Only correct comment on here, but personally we keep both tanks in. No reason not to and if we are that unlucky that both get knocked back, one intercept is enough to salvage the fight.
---
Whoa, are druids really that low?! I honestly thought they could kind of fuck around and beat almost anyone in a 1v1, beside maybe locks.
---
They patched ony, not rag
---
Stomping ungeared/underleveled players might be the initial reason for twinking, but nowadays a lot of people twink because it's actually really fun to play against other twinks, where everyone is equally geared, unlike BGs at 60. It's also much easier and especially less time consuming to max out a twink than it is to max out a lvl 60. And twinks can actually be finished. As soon as you get all your gear and enchants, you can just focus on PvPing. You don't have to go back to raiding every few months to get the better gear again.
---
Sure, you could have everyone wearing white or gray gear or even no gear to have it be balanced, but that takes away the aspect of twinking out your character, which can also be a fun part.
---
People like OP are why I take such joy in making the game drag out in AV. AV is meant to be long, at least an hour. I remember spending entire evenings in a single AV and it was great! This may come as a surprise but you're meant to pvp and have fun in BGs, not grind rep. This is a fucking video game and OP is treating it like the Olympics lol. 
---
Once I'm in AV I just wanna fight some horde. IDC about honour per hour, I just want to PvP. Usually I just ride around looking for horde to have some 1v1 with. Maybe some small group skirmishes. Maybe eventually Ill get a high rank / rep but if I don't that's ok I still had fun. Typically Im happy with 1 AV, I stay in and pvp till we win or till I get bored and quit. The deserter debuff is no issue if I'm done with pvp for the night.
---
I'm assuming OP is a retail player and never actually played vanilla, and even if they did have likely been on retail so long that they know nothing but the Rush Rush Rush gameplay that shit fosters. Get out of my fav BG with this optimized gameplay BS!!
---
The only time I stop pvping is when some neckbeard starts raging because we are "wasting his time and ruining honour per hour" yeaaaa thats when the pvp stops and the snowball fights, dance parties, and fishing contests begin!
---
This subreddit is so sad.  It is literally all rank 3 casuals complaining about a game that they do not understand.  Let's go turtle!  Who cares that we could get two thousand honor in a 10min loss by killing Lts!  It's fun being stupid! Zugg zugg!  Had a warrior charge into our 40 man and sapper yesterday.  The horde are actually braindead.
---
I already quit retail for good (this time for real! :P) and moment they announce current Classic servers are getting upgraded to TBC I am quitting WoW entirely for good.
---
I'd stay for Classic+, but with minimal additions. I wouldn't mind to see some QoL changes and Arenas.
---
My favorite type of evidence:
---
"Hey my homebrew spec beat out a stoner guildy, his 8 year old son, and the pug in my raid so Im certain my spec is good!"
---
Awhile back there were reports of a bug were if you did not finish the quest "show your work" you can get locked into an engineering spec.  I do not know if this has been fixed.  
---

---
You'll always be seen as a healer mate. Such is the nature of the beast.
---
It's the same tactic, but as I said, bliz patched the 3 lowest guid. So now it's 3 random melee range targets. Hence why you keep the offtank out of melee to pick up if the MT gets knocked. Or you can have melee use barov caller to have many units in melee range and hope the maintank doesnt get knocked. This way you can keep the OT in.
---
Not sure why you are saying "\^ this" when your strat is completely different.
---
First of all, your strategy includes slower dps by having everyone move out, second...you're increasing the chance of your MT being knocked back.
---
Just do what /u/Gluestuck said and you'll have higher likelihood of killing before submerge.
---
I've not fully done the math but yes you'd get more value but that is a pretty steep cost.
---
Just putting down so thoughts here, so excuse any errors:
---
If you're using a 2.7 speed weapon, the fight needs to be 270 seconds for you go get an extra attack.  Divided by the % tack speed increase.  So 3% = one extra attack each 90 seconds (for each weapon). So take one weapon damage /90 for increased dps. 
---
Meanwhile 23 strength is equal to 3.3 dps (46 AP* 1dps/14ap).  But this also increases yellow instant attacks and procs like wind fury.
---
So weapons would need to be hitting for more than 300 on an attack, more from the increase value from other instant attacks. 
---
Other notes is crit value needs to be included - which I think favours the extra attack. The %as also required certain length fights.
---
What UI do you use for the raid?
---
Check out the RP servers
---
Does it have to be bay of storms or on the shore?
---
Congrats. You’re one of millions of players to hit level 60!
---
#Nochanges
---
Threat management is  group effort, the tank however shouldn't have any issue with threat in MC beside random WF/HoJ procs.
---
That’s the joke
---
lol just wanted to ask this but on the alliance side, tbh I barely found any info on 2h fury in general
---
Mmh, would be annoying if true. Won't trust it without numbers to look at though. At least my druid alt now has a purpose :D
---
The person you're replying to is effectively saying that in order for you to be top 5, lots of under players are playing *below average*, because on average, spriests perform lower than warriors, mages and rogues.
---
Actually yes, fights like 4horsemen are going to be just zerged down.
---
Look, whether the knockback is random or pre-selected...doesn't matter. 
---
/u/Gluestuck has given the correct strategy either way.  Everyone stays in, MT taunts and aggressively gathers aggro at RoW; if MT is knocked back, OT taunts and goes for threat so DPS can go hard.
---
My guild has done this exclusively and has never failed to down him before submerge.
---
You will be fine without it, can’t tell the diff in AV. Don’t get stuck on a rock for one sec and boom, no difference. 
---
Saves three inv spaces and lots of clicking if you don’t intall ADDONS to automate it. I’ll have all three equipped on my main and cant tell a difference.
---
You mean the Sith?
---
Hydraxian, so yeah, low pop server, plus so many people have the good enchants too, like crusader and spell power.
---
The odd thing is I got a really good enchant that's pretty rare, the +9 strength on bracers and not one person has wanted it.
---
I mostly get requests for spell power or a random bracer enchant.
---
Also constantly get requests for enchants that few if no people have on my server, like the +9 int bracers.
---
SC procs much more frequently than once per 12 minutes, wtf are you smoking. You write shitty spreadsheets.
---
This type of post needs to be banned
---
How bad is the server skewed?
---
To be honest we do as you said and keep the offtank in. But I thought I'd write the safer option for people who are struggling!
---
Correct. If everyone moves out, there is less pool for mt to avoid knockbacks, guid or not.
---
I never understand that, why not play a Skill-Based Game like Quake or StarCraft then? The point of an RPG is to equip your Character to get more powerful (than other Players).
---
Lmao good argument duude.
---
Onslaught girdle, band of accuria, ony head (all 3 of these are BIS till p5/6).. deathbringer potentially but will be replaced in BWL. 
---
I also have Wristguards of Stability and flameguard Gauntlets. Strikers mark is decent too with hit %+ap but the first 3 I'd prio
---
Once you start doing dungeons and group content it gets a lot better.  The other guys advice about finding a leveling guild, just say in general chat or looking for group chat, is spot on. Lots of people have finished leveling one char to 60 already and are leveling alts. Also find out the composition, horde vs alliance, and general population size of your server. Maybe your on a dying server and don’t know it? If so restart a new character on a more populated server.
---
I did that and people whined a lot. Though the low level ones were 5g, I'm still learning what gold is worth in this game relative to what people can get, especially accounting for non-farming classes. 
---
I will try 1g for all other enchants except ones i know are on the rare side or are raid only.
---
&lt;gets more head than lice&gt;
---
Right before ony head no doubt
---
Semi-Hardcore mode on a single pvp server with forced faction balance and stupidly strict rules for cross faction cooperation.
---
Only way to come back to life is to get ressed by another player, and all resses have like a 2 day cooldown.
---
I want people to feel miserable, and be angry when they die, just so they can be stupidly ecstatic when they survive.
---
Theres actually 3 alliance teams: The highrankers fast to Drek premade A with nearly 100% winrate, The bunch of randoms on discord  B that gets slowed down by horde defense with 30-60% winrate and then theres the complete pug C that has afkers, bots, 52lvls just like hordeteam yet gets stomped to the ground by players who had to learn to play as a team with strangers using only textchat everytime.
---
I love turtles, the 2nd best part about actually getting to PvP is all the salty tryhards who wanna lose faster for more efficiency. go fuck yourself
---
Projecting? You're just embarrased because im making sense lol
---
Didn't know that. I just knew you want go from pve to PVP.
---
what's the addon to see your guid?
---
lmao you mean cuz alliance can unfairly premade while horde can't, and high ranked/geared organized players will stomp an unorganized group
---
This omg op please don't quit the quest
---
Let their guild know. They may or may not care. If they care he would be punished and maybe you’d be compensated. It’s a long shot but worth a try
---
What the hell did you do to get that much money? Layering for lotus?
---
Ok sweet! Thanks
---
Was also wondering if there was an add-on like the trinket one where to left or right click depending on what trinket you want into each slot.
---
Serpent sting scales 100% with spell damage for hunter and is the most efficient spell a hunter has. Why do you try to correct people when you don’t know what you’re talking about?
---
its a video game, itts all supposed to be about fun lmao
---
me. I dont even listen to people screeching in chat anymore  'm out in mid kiilling alliance stragglers lol
---
Lol
---
I'm level 300 with plenty of rare enchants, including fun ones that have affects on weapons. 
---
Invested plenty of gold and time, farming greens and blues and disenchanting everything, even getting friends to send stuff for that purpose.
---
There is no lack of investment, there is a lack of people understanding how much goes into enchanting and how much of a gold sink it is until you can start charging a bit for enchants, especially the special hard to get ones.
---
Another part of the issue is likely that I'm just on one of the lower pop servers, which is still massive compared to vanilla, but there is less interest in general. Also sucks to be on and see 3 other people also advertising. You don't know their prices because it's either tips or "whisper me for info" so you don't know how to compete. Many just go the obnoxious route and spam their advertisement every minute.
---
shilling for blizzard intensifies
---
Have you ever done it? It’s literally free money. Anyone can do it.
---
The very fact there are people cheating in this manner (Blizzard will no doubt do fuck all about it) should convince any sane person not to try for R14.
---
I don't think that exist for weapons no
---
Serpent sting can be used on literally every mob, and should be since it is so efficient. Idk what game you’re playing.
---
Lol. I think about this all the time. Thankfully I talk myself out of buying up the AH and relisting. You can’t compete with bots!
---
Math checks out
---
imagine having instant qs and being this mad
---
Where?
---
If you can convince your guild higher the dps the more loot prio than yeah but I plan on selling most of my mats it the price spikes for a bit it only takes me 1-2 3 hr sessions to restock my basic potions and flask will be useless to me if the rest of my guild isn’t using them
---
that is really sad lol its a video game, get a grip
---
It will be difficult doing RFC as a gnome w/ no quests. Deadmines is a few levels later.
---
How’s it feel it to be a pussy
---
Well you were the victim of terrible advice then. Sucks man. But yeah there's really not much of a demand for enchanters because most people have guildies doing it for free, and all those guild enchanters sell to randoms as well driving the price down.
---
Right click chat tab and go to settings.. there’s like 6 channels.
---
Cos sneaky blue boys are lining the entrance with portals? Mwahaha
---
It's fun. In retail, my priest is in full RP gear, complete with shitty shilleleigh.
---
Are you on a PvE server?  What the hell do you mean nobody wanted it.
---
Que lol
---
It's a pvp weapon for horde too.......
---
we'e still gonna keep defending, every game I try to get as many people as possible on D to keep them long as possible. stay mad lol
---
No?  You have to sacrifice your succubus for 15%shadow damage
---
Go at off hours so you are guaranteed all the kills, figure out all the patrolling spawns, which should eat up most of the 5 min &amp; 15 sec respawn timer, and if you have time left over while you're waiting, don't get lazy; kill the other humanoids. I got lots of runecloth and I got lucky with an HP Librum on top of this double formula luck.
---
Fair enough. Ppl who downvoted me are greedy tho
---
But in 1v1 duels? Thought they were better.
---
Its simple you just share your account.
---
Show me 1 rank 14 who didn't share accounts or use a bot program and i'll show you a liar.
---
I'm an Enchanter and this is bad for business. I'm sorry you had to deal with that. If anyone needs enchants in Earthfury, don't hesitate to ask. - Batpiss
---
People will not usually give you a hard time if you are upfront and say it’s your first run. MC is easy and you have more then enough gear to OT. FR is really not too big of a deal so I wouldn’t worry about it. 
---
I used to message just random geared warriors I saw in IF or Org and asked if they could answer some questions on the specifics of tanking or MC. There are good YouTube videos out there that can help as well! 
---
All in all, you should definitely go, and don’t stress it. You only learn from experience and you learn even more from mistakes. Good luck!
---
there are some elements of skill but none that can't be outweighed by really good luck
---
Well all flasks require a Black Lotus, so they're not gonna be any cheaper than one of those. I feel sorry for the people farming flasks every week while half the raid is probably still wearing gear from ZF or SM.
---
A lot of people experienced in mmo's will mainly talk about end game, because that's where the majority of their play will be if they become invested.
---
That's crazy, our server is over ran by AV Auto Clicking Bots, auto queue, Join, casts a spell or jumps every few mins to keep from afk'ing... It's getting old fast.
---
Yea, I've been leveling in felwood on my horde character, and I constantly see level 60 hordes doing in between queue ganking.
---
Honor. I want r10
---
Has to be bay of storms.
---
They designed those fights without a debuff limit. Much harder to reverse engineer an old design. Can't fix an abortion.
---
I’ve seen this posted before too and never understood it so is there just a long timer on the dead bodies or an insanely fast spawn time?  I’ve run that gauntlet of the river as a shammy trying to get a totem quest done and there were crocs but not nearly that many
---
Use to see if anyone is picking our flag usually or to see where further enemy's are. Eagle eye is incredibly under used, wherever you eagle eye you can see that area with your tracking humanoid. So you can be horde roof and use it at a certain angle to scope alliance base and target EFC and see if his health is dropping as well!
---
Its not the same person killing me. Usually 1-3 people running around the zone killing everyone in it over and over. Stonetalon Mountains and Barrens is where im currently leveling. Im on Grobbulus.
---
EDIT: Barrens I get ganked much less so maybe i should just stay in that zone.
---
How do you make money with that? Enchanted disenchanting and hoping you can sell the odd BiS Orge Magi staff etc?
---
Same reason people could get temp band for mcing and walking people out of BG portals
---
What a shitty idea
---
Hey I remember you, I was one time In a wsg with you and you carried the flag 3 times and made that alliance gy jump from bottom to top looks so easy! I even /w you and said something to you. Was a great bg, who needs druids when you can have a good mage. :)
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Sick that you manage to get back to rank1, would never do that if I ever get to rank10!
---
And hunters and warlocks.
---
&lt;Onyxia gives epic head&gt;
---
Pvp racials do not play a big enough role in pvp in general let alone big enough to dictate you having a 100% loss rate in AV.  
---
Think about it like this: the horde are constantly fighting premades ontop of regular pugs, what this caused is people will listen to callouts from other pugs * a lot more* than alliance, why? Because losing a game in 7 minutes fucking sucks after waiting for 25. It has made all the horde a ton more receptive because the stakes are much higher. People generally want to pvp and when you are faced with; listen to this random and lose fast or at *worst* lose slower, either way youre gonna play the game after waiting for so long.  
---
Its just a mentality issue.
---
I thought the only major class abilities  that got banned were for locks, rogues, and hunter pre traps (and every hunter still traps before the opener anyways).
---
tribute runs?  i do it all the time and it requires a grasp of how the class works and game  mechanics on how mobs move which I would not expect someone who thinks spell power is good on a hunter to know. have *you* ever done it?
---
Haven't won a single AV since it came out lol (alliance)
---
You dont want to play the thing you sign up to play?
---
Id say Alliance on Stalagg. We made that shitty wannabe tryhard alli guild Grizzly quit after all.
---
You must only see shitty shadow priests.
---
Auto-Running after 5 mins = AFK and Removed from the game, he has a program running to hold W down and it keeps him from going AFK "Bannable Offense" A lot of people are using stuff like this to auto queue, and run them into a certain area to keep them from AFK'ing.. Not 100% Bot that injects into wow but auto clickers that mindlessly do it.
---
Thanks! Tried my best.
---
What kinda +healing do you have?
---
Ony has 2 aggrowhiping abilities: fireball from phase 1 and the  knockback the tank getting when to far ahead in threat. In your case the tank prbably got the knockback
---
You will see way more than one button spam from the highest DPS mages/warlocks.
---
If you’re alliance. Go to Brill. That place is swarmin
---
A big fuck you to all the priests and paladins removing my shadow word like its your sole purpose on this earth.
---
the blizzard one
---
I mean it killed world pvp as a meaningful activity.  No flying though still means you get random fights outside of hubs.
---
In this tournament just about everyone has best in slot gear and engineering. As burst damage increases the druid gets worst. Even easy matchups like warrior and mage become losing matchups with every cooldown available. Druids largely win by attrition so they simply dont scale as well with gear that allows other classes to burst harder.
---
Because Quake and StarCraft are nothing like WoW PvP, and if you think that's all WoW is about then you are not very familiar with WoW.
---
25 icc hm wasnt easy
---
&lt;Heavens Gate Away Team&gt;
---
Did you not see what happened when world pvp was actually incentivized less than a month ago?
---
Imo you shouldn't be downranking in MC or Ony. Bring 10 major mana pots and some dark runes. 
---
Basically just spam max rank Flash heal and use shields on people that are high risk of dying.
---
damn nice treants bane, did you buy it from a hunter? im aliance so no axe spec warriors over here :(
---
i also thought they're like tier 2 duelers
---
It's bad enough  when I know what vid she is in
---
On my server someone tries to run mc with a pug. Its not like I am not intrested but I search for the guild and he has none, so nah thanks.
---
You learned your lesson the hard way, but always stick to big guilds! Or friends in other guilds.
---
bullshit :) recapping a gy, spinning the flag, sapping a rogue when they go for a flag gap while calling for help... calling incs on a bunker or tower, soulstoning a healer before you die... ALL ways you can individually make a massive difference.
---
but stamina and general survivability should rise as well, not just burst
---
They used to have minefields so you couldn't zerg mindlessly and they changed that.
---
That girl looks like she is enjoying a nice massage or something.
---
That's this entire subreddit in a nutshell.  Dad gamers crying about people not playing "for fun" and trashing min/maxers.
---
Good bot
---
The way classic pvp goes is you have to spend a ton of time grinding honor.  I'd like a break every once in awhile but unfortunately you fall behind if you do that.  If queue times were 10 minutes then there would be a built in break.
---
Is it not easier to make the boat move rather than the world and all the players?

In vanilla and TBC I never got it. But if you try to play retail now, you realize how quickly stuff gets out dated. Each patch youll need a whole new gear, let alone next expansion. The only thing that carries over is appearances and mounts, which is why they have become the meta.
---
He will get suspended but you will not get your items back.
---
Just get an epic mount and join your servers average shit premade for a day or two, it's really not that difficult. Is it good honor? Not really, but it will get you exalted quicker than anything else.
---
&gt; If you're pulling 30 mobs there no way a warrior can kill them with 2h fast enough.
---
Ravager says hi /s
---
Well it is optimal if you ONLY care about mana efficiency. But HPS is often more important. 
---
On any geared holy paladin you don't care about getting the most mana efficiency since you can spam rank 6 with onyxia/diremaul/song flower buffs anyway and just chug superior mana pots.
---
This is correct. I'd like to add that premades not only take away good players from PUG alliance matches, but they also cause "late starts" where the game starts with 40 horde and 10-20 alliance. Those alliance spots fill in but it's already too late. The horde will be off to a strong start and it's really hard to recover from that.
---
I put on FR and still get fuck-stomped by double blossom lol.  Easier to have some self control and wait for the threat list.
---
Premade stuff
---
Fine they can be blues instead of purpled
---
Sounds like you’re the one taking it seriously.
---
Like I said I grinded for these herbs myself I’m going to sell most of not all of these materials when bwl makes the prices sky rocket
---
I started doing this, I have 300 cooking and create grilled squid. Each one sells for 60-75s.
---
I like seeing what someone is actually wearing, so I'd like no transmogs to happen.
---
That said, I am definitely not in the #nochanges camp.
---
Lol, this thing is telling me to cast Max-Rank Healing Touch and Regrowth, but only Rank 2 Rejuvenation. Uhhh I’m not so sure about that....
---
If you can find one with casual requirements then sure. Generally the cross realm ones are mores strict and difficult to get into, at least here on EU.
---
Amazing how much unrelated shit you can piece together.
---
BTW even though my server has more Horde players, there were only Alliance death squads roaming the leveling zones and even camping the UC entrance.
---
I’ll bet it’s escape
---
I haven't been watching, has there been any locks that aren't SL?
---
I've been messing with it, it does pretty well on single target, the only problem is rage dumping, if you could get HS off on the next swing with the cancel macro it would be really good, but i haven't seen or discovered a way to do that yet. One Slam crit into WF proc is a full rage bar. It's difficult to play.
---
Frost wolf mount is already out idk what you're talking about?
---
Depends how quick your rag kill time is. You can get away with none if you kill him fast.
---
They're right clicking afterwards  when moving, even clicking right click once will cancel the cursor. I do it so fast it's basically muscle memory and you won't see the reticule. Try it and get used to it, just queue up the grenade reticule and hit right click.
---
Get off your high horse. Some people like to pvp.
---
I would recommend going fire and getting 3/3 elemental precision. You don’t really need much in frost because you have nova and CoC. Having a 10% chance to stun is also huge. Just stack fire damage and you’ll be fine
---
Fireball/Pyroblast has 100% spell coefficient
---
Fireblast has a 42.85%
---
I mean this is what you get when you turtle premades. I hope you like it.
---
I turn off my ambient sounds but they always re-enable somehow. Anyway to make this more permanent?
---
1ppm hahahahhahah, THAT IS DATA FROM NOSTRALIUS YOU IMMENSE IDIOT.
---
I have a sample size of over 45 combat hours.  I will donkey you in full greens and a green dagger  vs. Shadowcraft bullshit.  Idiots, all of you.
---
Thats what I think aswell. Beyond my understanding why someone would scam from a 60 character though. Pretty good items aswell (t2 helm, animaited chain, reed, hide of the wild etc). Its easily 15-20 days played time unless he powerleveled to 60 with some luck on the item drops. Might be a stolen account but that only rests my case
---
\#showtooltip Iron Grenade
---
/cast \[@cursor\] Iron Grenade
---
/cast \[@cursor\] Thorium Grenade
---
/stopcasting
---
This macro casts iron grenade at your cursors location, press it again and you stop casting your grenade, obviously you can remove the \[@cursor\] part to click but honestly I think at cursor is best for nading.
---
It’s the meta* tho 👄
---
Ah, the "I would just conjure a full 40 man out of my ass" response.
---
No one enjoyed those random fights though. No one was like "Sick this rogue just opened up on me at 20% HP!"
---
I did :(
---
&lt;And two stealthed rogues&gt;
---
Come Honor
---
When’s the head dropping?
---
Yep, this is the legend himself.
---
I'm assuming shield block when on cooldown too to keep revenge up?
---
The feeling of leveling with someone then seeing them a week later in a different zone is pretty awesome
---
Dude what you play osrs and you call a 2hr questing session to 10 a grind?
---
Sodapoppin seems to do fine, I think the others druids are just not as geared/good as him.
---
Get in line
---
It's very good if you know all the mechanics involved with slam. It depends on the fight, but on certain fights our top fps is a 2h fury war.
---
Yep
---
I'd say gear will be very helpful, espaicailly if you're not an aoe master.  I wasn't.  My benchmark was 6k mana, because you'll need enough mp for 4 blizzards and 2 frost novas at least.
---
limited invulnerability pots
---
Could you share any guide with it? When I tried to search for some slam tips theyre all outdated private server info and slam doesnt work the same way in classic.
---
Stage 7 allready, 40 horde camping fw gy &amp;hut from the start vs premade  
---
Russian horde are the best, they kill vann in 7m each game
---
It's, for the most part, not about time. It's about the lack of anything else of value for a Tank, so the only reason for them to be there in the first place is the orbs.
---
where is ma paladin!!!!
---
In our guild we have like 8/9 deep wounds and 4 lock, 1 sp (2 sometimes). Does the deep wound remove the corruption ? 
---
We had to start analyzing the debuff slots since we have multiple complain from the warlock that the corruption often get remove when it does so much more dmg overall and can proc instant sb
---
I wish it was a 10% win rate. I’m at three wins in two weeks.
---
You are a TERRIBLE player, but there are some people worse than you. Those are the rogues you beat.  Make no mistake, I DONKEY you. HARD. I know the rogue class and am well recognized as the foremost authority on all things related to the class.  Who are you? Oh, nobody. Shut up, idiot.
---
Also with Flameguards, once they die they have fire on the ground. Move out IMMEDIATELY, tell your melee dps etc to move immediately.
---
I just got 5400 in 30 mins 
---
Discord.gg/HeuRqW for horde pre made av
---
Imagine queuing for 15 mins to force a turtle 20-30 min game and still lose.  Just horde things.
---
So instead you just use the flightpaths which basically bring you to your destination and tab out for a few minutes anyways lol. Unless you're just not using flightmasters in classic then it's essentially the same thing.
---
&gt;As a feral cat, you want Truestrike Shoulders
---
As a Feral cat, you probably don't have a raid spot. This doesn't change that you *also* have instant dungeons groups because you can perform any role in them
---
So anyway, I started charging
---
wtf are you talking about? ofc im in a guild, like i said. why would i lie about that, being in a guild is not an achievement or anything :S fucking weirdo
---
Nice
---
The tournament has rules in place to try and maintain some balance.
---
The majority of the players are randoms/streamers as-well, the only class that's stacked with actual competitive players is mage.
---
Shadow Priests are not a second class citizen RIGHT NOW when it comes to DPS. I'm pulling 470-530 DPS on a lot of the MC fights.
---
None of those are actually going to be the difference between a win or a loss. If five people did that, then yes. But just you? No. One player AFK in the tunnel to AV have extremely low impact on the match.
---
I don't know why people think this, WPvP isn't dead in retail, if someone is flying near you and you want to gank them then just use a net-o-matic. Flying isn't what stopped people from WPvP'ing.
---
gains is fun
---
You're getting downvoted because this sub is generally full of trash players.  But you're absolutely right.
---
Mind flay isn't really a debuff slot btw. The debuff portion is just the slow. It can get wiped off and the damage will still apply in full for the entire duration.
---
It´s in the post but I maybe should have highlighted it a bit more, but its Ganktime (shaman) on Gehennas
---
Yeah this is about the response I would expect from someone with your takes.
---
I meant that 3 weeks in VERY few guilds had enough people to not have to pug a sizable chunk of their raid, and you cant do LC with that.  The idea that you'd have an LC run that early is what I was saying is silly; you can't.
---
Funny cuz you could never beat an AI chess or go player in a million years
---
Such salty tears, enjoy your queue.
---
best class to level is mage, because a booster will always want  a mage to help, free or not. I always take mages for free in deadmines, stockades, SM. In 44 you can do solo ZF till 55 and in 55 you can buy like 50 limited invul pots and go to DM north to kill hyenas and bugs for xp ( 54k an hour, 50k at 58 till 60 ). Since trash from DM north is expensive, including the greens, you should be making more than what you spent on invul pots, and at 58 you don't need it anymore.
---
I tried this twice and got my mage to 60 in 4 days game time.
---
I dislike going into SM and all others above that level with a group, because there's always going to be that 1 idiot that would mess up the entire thing and sometimes without him you'll have difficulties with heals or dps. In SM every time a person leaves you have to find a another one, and he appears to be all the way back in IF. In ZF you have to deal with idiots who doesn't know how to run to gy or focus killing wards. In BRD you have to spend 30 mins corpse running, and every time somebody leaves it's a pain in the ass to wait for them to get to the dungeon.
---
For fastest class to find a group, priest or warrior is always in demand, especially priest and paladin healer.
---
Worst class to find a group atm is rogue and druid healer/feral since most people only want healer with ressurect and dps with aoe now
---
There's multiple boats so they have to move.
---
I’m fairly certain it was in vanilla. We had multiple people in my guild with the marshal/grand marshal title and they damn sure weren’t still that rank.
---
Unless ally has a premade, the games take atleast half an hour from my experience over the course of the last days.
---
Every game is the same: ally gets wiped and everyone runs around stonehearth doing nothing or straight up afks until the game is over. Maybe  a few go south and kill a few Lt's but thats it.
---
This is terrible advice do not do this lmao. This is what the noob priests in my guild do. They’re always OOM (after every pull) and almost never make their way thru a full fight unless they’re are chugging pots and runes. 
---
Whenever I look at logs, it’s easy to see the good priests and the shit ones. Good priests will have Heal as their most used/healed spell. Terrible priests have flash heal as #1, and a hilarious amount of mana used on renew and shields. 
---
If you want to power chug consumables and max tank flash heal...be my guest. It’s just noob as hell and totally unnecessary.
---
&gt; If they have your mats it is returned to you.
---
This is not true.
---
Source: Was scammed and noticed the guy was banned for a couple of days. I did not get my items back.
---
Deep Prot will last you just fine. If you hate Fury Tanking, you can stick with Deep Prot through all tiers of content unless your DPS are pushing really high numbers.
---
getting a shit ton of crits or resists doesn't make you better. perfectly even, 0 rng fights is what's measured. nice try though
---
This is the most 2007 shit that I’ve seen in a while.
---
"Ha, I got him to insult me after doing the same multiple times, this makes me right!".
---
Thoughts And prayers
---
How long can you sustain that for, and how many other mages are there?
---
This is accurate although I haven’t seen stage 6 yet
---
&gt; It's about the lack of anything else of value for a Tank, so the only reason for them to be there in the first place is the orbs.
---
Lol, please.
---
Guess what, bud? We're 4 months into classic.
---
Most people are 60 and in not just preraid bis gear, but *full* bis gear. I know I am. 
---
Most people do not need anything from any dungeon. I hardly even need shadow pieces for offspec at this point. We're all after orbs. Tanks are not the only ones and it's pretty damn ridiculous for them to think they are.
---
chess is one of if not the only game in the world that you can't beat a computer in. computers have infinitely more processing power than a human brain.
---
Maybe because I'm on mobile but is this specific server? I dont see server listed
---
Horde pretend that this hasn't been happening, and that all Ally avoid PvP, its great lol
---
actually i have not won a single AV, not even close, i got a few cheeky 1 shot on the horde and that's about it, but i will always get a few zerg fight in the beginning until most of the alliance decided to afk and let horde wins
---
Who is saying classic is dead? I haven’t seen a single comment saying that, even on this sensationalist sub lol
---
I literally listed another game that you can’t beat a computer in, so you are both wrong and illiterate.
---
Thistle tea being banned is really stupid as it not really meant to be viewed as a consumable but more of a class ability that you make.
---
Almost all rogue abilities require reagents to use, blind vanish etc.
---
Thistle tea is basically a 5 minute 100 energy burst that is tied to rogues only.
---
Feral druids can't use it and only rogues can make it.
---
Thistle tea is more akin to a class ability than a consumable.
---
7 matchs is a small sample size
---
Auctioneer and Vendor Price.
---
This gets posted at least once every few days.
---
False. 20-25 minute games where horde D are better for honor.
---
On average about 7k honor for those games compared to 3k for a 10 minute loss.
---
This is over 200 games played data from my Farmlog.
---
make sure you dont forget to park in an inn every night for that double xp. basic info but can speed it up a ton when you add the down time in
---
Can you enchant fiery weapon onto weapons with a proc already? And will it work together? Weapon I'm talking about is "meteor shard" from shadow fang keep.
---
Well gear, rotation, position and consumables play a part also tryharding it .I really love nightfall for bursts on trash which dies fast procs so much and feel like it gives me the edge would hate playing without it.
---
Might try DS/Ruin eventually tho i would hate playing without NF
---
P2 has given me a "kill any horde on sight, esp lower levels" mentality. Sucks for them, but revenge is a dish best served cold.

If only it were so difficult and cute. Or just cute.

He literally just told you
---
Why are shamans so low?
---
How do you know it's not?
---
Probably because he never was successful at them, therefore they are bad.

You stand in org and spam this macro:

You’re basically a vendor now. Have fun!
---
You guys don't seem to want to win fast either, though.
---
Yeah not sure how to get to lashers? No need to be a dick
---
Eh.... please figure out a different way to incentivize dungeon running than chuck-e-cheese tokens
---
Immersion breaking, loot-reward breaking, unrewarding, all of the above
---
What a shitty shitty shitty mechanic. I don’t want to run 100 dungeons for some tokens I can cash in with a vendor who happens to have amazing gear that I need to save the world (why didn’t he just give it to me in the first place?)
---
Just add a rep grind for something, or crafting mats, literally anything except fucking tokens
---
It's misleading. A Warrior that has Recklessness up is pretty dangerous. That's very infrequent in actual PvP because it's a 30 min CD. In the duel tourney, it's up pretty much 50% of the time because you pop everything in duel 1 and take the L on duel 2. Then you wait 2 hours for your next 2 duels.
---

---
Honestly, get better at AoE. Whatever your 1 to 47 time is you can assume about 70% of that is what it will take to get to 60 with your current spec. AoE farming will speed it up and look for dungeons for BiS on the way. Personally, if you are having trouble with it, start with mobs a couple levels lower than you (melee only) to figure it out. Do just a 2 pull, then 3. After an hour or two you will work up to full on AoE grind and it will feel good. Buy some cheap gear with stam/int to get more mana and health. 
---
You can raid sub 60, just get your attunement. To cheese that, have the guild run a BRD with a lock to attune someone then once there boot someone and then summon someone else. Can do several people this way.
---
but i thought this 15 year old game was solved smh
---
I mean does he have to draw a map? He told you the specific instance go in and find them
---
&gt;Right now they win against the bad premades...
---
LOL, even without ever being organized we beat your premades.
---
Alliance players are a fucking joke. Literally need to treat AV like a raid to win because they suck so much.
---
Also, a lot of people playing classic as horde always played horde. This argument about min/maxing is bullshit made up to make yourselves feel better for being such shit.
---
I’m asking for help because I really don’t know. Your comments help nothing please go troll elsewhere
---
Only a week in nmz
---
&gt;remove the frost mage talent that lets blizzard slow
---
??
---
I’ve heard some weird ideas for classic+, but this one is really strange to me
---
Like... why?
---
Yes.
---
That doesn't matter. Basically everybody has dots. And if *everybody* starts using them that is a huge dps increase collectively. 
---
Also as a warlock I hold my own against our mages/rogues/warriors pretty decently. Never topping but damn close. If I could use all my dots that would be a huge dps increase.
---
One time it works instantly. Next time I spend five minutes running into a wall. 
---
Wish I could say I knew the method to the madness.
---
Don't spread BS, t1 bracers are 800-1200g
---
No.
---
you sound like a really fun person
---
that is true if you consider thorium going up during darkmoon faire. Mage is not the best class to make high end gold, more like easier in terms of gear requirement to start making gold, and they're less reliant on the market to make gold
---
Fair enough mate use whatever rank heal suits you and your situation. But if your goal is to heal as effectively as possible mana efficiency is far from a priority.
---
you know me all to well
---
Didn’t you read? If it’s not MAXIMUM META then it’s ABSOLUTELY WORTHLESS.
---
Thistle Tea just makes counterplay vs. a Rogue stunlock even harder. It's removed to make Rogues less good. 
---
The rules aren't random.
---
&gt; But you and me still know the person is guilty and should be held to different standards than you and me.
---
Actually, no dipshit. That's not what "I know", don't place words into my mouth or attribute your bullshit to me. 
---
Your comment is literally the epitome of paragraph 3 of my comment.
---
And don't act like I'm using the mathematical essence of "proof". Proof is what Warden does, matching hash signatures of game memory to known cheats. GM's utilizing GM commands to disrupt bot behavior to act completely unlike a human is not "proof" under this strict definition. But this is literally just NumLock. Any player can reproduce this behavior with 1 button press, so it's clearly not proof of botting.
---
Unbelievable.
---
inb4 \[removed\]
---
Yes but AV wasn't good for honor for most of Vanilla would be slow and take too long before 10-20 nerfs it got since 1.5 patch.So ppl had to play organized pvp and skill mattered couldn't really afk and farm also
---
Imagine needing voicecomms and gear checks to beat regular unorganized Horde players in battlegrounds.
---
Just Alliance things.
---
Dungeon grinding with your guild is probably fastest.
---
this makes the most sense.
---
Gnome warlocks aren't so bad. Your racials are great for a warlock.
---
And you're on the side with paladins who can buff you. Horde doesn't get the paladin buffs, and shamans aren't providing any buffs to casters at all.
---
Damn, 10 Horde are so powerful it seems like they are 25-30 to the puny Alliance player.
---
Zug zug.
---
Thank you for your prompt reply. I really appreciate it.
---
Butthurt Alliance players downvoting this.
---
But what does “effective” mean for you here? If you can do the same job (killing an MC boss specifically), and use way less mana accomplishing that, wouldn’t that be more effective/better? I just don’t understand flash heal spamming in MC....it’s objectively completely unecessarry, especially in speed runs.
---
You're welcome!
---
That's it. You just go backwards, hit jump once. Smooth like butter.
---
Free action potions are a must for warriors and rogues.
---
Damn man I appreciate the time and effort you put into this! This is exactly what I was looking for, especially since the cost between librams can be considerable at this point BUT you make a great argument in favor of voracity. I’m just used to playing an enhance shaman in BC so I’m basically in love with haste haha; thanks again!
---
It's in the WoW 15th Anniversary Collector's Edition, comes in a huge box. It looks quite nice despite being made cheaply.
---
Can one of these be a pinned post already?
---
&gt; we will take away all your honor and only leave you with your long ass queues.
---
Well I mean, that's exactly what Alliance had to deal with during the Rath Strat days. You were lucky to even get any bonus honor at all.
---
&gt;Earth shock only locks you out of 1 school
---
It is currently bugged and causes a GCD to trigger on EVERY SCHOOL right now, which is a massive advantage. You can't bait with scorch and have a frostbolt lined up already for example, you can't Ice Block either even though your fire school was hit, etc, you just have to dance around for a whole GCD.
---
For The Herd
---
Im on a pve server, so that doesnt affect me in any way. But hey, you do you.
---
Settle down there, Santa.
---
You can heal as ret
---
Its also better rep to drag the game out, allows for more rep turn ins. Losing in 6 mins means shit all reputation.
---
Are you talking shit when you queued as a team of 40 versus 40 random players?
---
Yikes
---
[Oh the Horde's hypocrisy of it all.](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/4044465077)
---
I don’t know if you’re talking out of your ass or just an AFK AV bot. PvP in both TBC and WotLK was immensely refined as compared to classic.
---
Classic rewards players equally for no lifing (which is fine, kinda) and botting/afk honor grinding (which is garbage) whereas TBC onwards arena was the source of top tier gear and was based on skill. Geared earned in arena meant you were good, whereas gear earned in classic means F-all.
---
&gt;But what does “effective” mean for you here?
---
"Effective" means highest HPS. 
---
&gt;If you can do the same job (killing an MC boss specifically), and use way less mana accomplishing that, wouldn’t that be more effective/better? 
---
No, because mana that isn't used during a fight is wasted anyway. If you want to do more healing, then you should spend as much mana as possible. 
---
&gt;I just don’t understand flash heal spamming in MC....it’s objectively completely unecessarry, especially in speed runs. 
---
It's objectively necessary if you are aiming to heal as much as possible in the space of a boss fight. 
---
Especially since we had 3 deaths on domo in the fight I linked which might have been prevented if we had a greater raidwide healing output. If those 3 didn't die we would save more time in the speedrun since we would have had two more warriors and a warlock with full buffs for Ragnaros, not to mention time spent resurrecting.
---
Nope, this seems about spot on.
---
Vanilla fans not big on multiple difficulties of the same raids/dungeons
---
The funny thing is, my healer friend prefers I just charge and gets annoyed when prot paladins sit and drink for longer and more often than them. Often times by the time they need to toss a heal after charging they're all full mp.
---
Uh, thats not accurate.
---
You can rested up to 1.5x your current XP bars worth of numerical XP.
---
eg; at level.. 1? your xp bar is 400
---
So your max rested xp is 600 xp.
---
This is what retail doesn't have with all cross realms mambo jumbo..i keep meeting ppl i leveld with a little in dungeons ,world and pvp and love it
---
Arena was better for competitive players, but even at its peak maybe 10% of the playerbase was regularly playing it. And its got a lot more competition this time around, so I would bet the numbers will be even smaller.
---
Alt-tabbed? Oh, for people with only one monitor. Gotcha. In TBC there was a little bell that rang whenever the Zeppelin/Boat arrived. I wish it would make a comeback.
---
This is exactly how Horde side AV was for the entire first week. I got exalted in about 3 days and I think I lost around 90% or more of those games. By the time I was exalted there was already nearly 10 minute queues.
---
And now it's far, far worse. Sure you'll win a fair amount of games vs. Alliance PuGs, but the other times you get put up vs. a Premade and lose in 7 minutes, and it's back to a 25 minute queue. Alliance have no business complaining about the state of AV.
---
Haha, you understood the joke too !
---
Alliance do pretty good job at stranding their own faction with less than 20 people at the start of these pug AVs.
---
All people with "qt" or anything of the like in their name are turbosweat neckbeard megafauna.
---
Not our fault all you wanted to get your hands held so you picked the faction with dominant numbers. Enjoy your queue.
---
Kinda the point tho is that they evolved and will again
---
Without these rules, some matchups would have a 100% win record for one class. Rogue vs hunter is a pretty pointless duel if the hunter can just sit on a trap and flare forever. Warrior vs mage is unwinnable if the mage gets to open from range. The rules are there so the tournament doesn't just consist of five classes. It's imbalanced enough even with these rules.
---
 #nochanges
---
11 or 12 kills at this point and haven't seen it drop once
---
I dont get these egotistic healers... if u wanna be egotistic then play the role that the least amount of people want to play... aka tank. The person who has more "control" is the one who is less expendable... so that's always gonna be the tank.. k?
---
No one can queue like that
---
When were these logs?
---
It is true, in an unfortunately accurate way. The Alliance are all about faster games since that's been the primary strat for over a decade (it's been this way since vanilla). Changes to that so that it's more in-line with wanting to actually PvP to victory is not likely to happen any time soon.
---
? Arenas were a much more popular version of PvP than the vanilla PvP system. It's basically the biggest gripe a lot of people in Classic have with the game... hence all the bitching on the subreddit around phase 2 and the AV grind meta. 
---
And are you really that the better player winning more often in arenas is a bad thing? I don't think that's a bad thing at all, and exactly why they added a rating system with it. Play enough games and you'll be going up against people of your own skill level, where you can work to improve your skills on an even playing field, unlike anything that ever existed in Classic. Also, it's not like they got rid of battlegrounds when they introduced arenas so I'm not even really sure what your point is...
---
&gt; Its quite a step up from "getting exalted in 2 days" as people are no longer bothering with turn-ins, and you get barely get any rep at all from losses.
---
The reason everyone ranked so fast was because Alliance won 90% of the games, and all the games were 10 minutes each.  They didn't really last long enough for turn-ins to even be a thing.  The sheer volume of fast wins was just crazy for rep.
---
This reason alone is why the Alliance lose all their games now:  they all give up because the game took more than 8 minutes.  They want the fast wins of the golden era and can't be bothered to even try if the game goes past 10 minutes.  They don't even walk past SHGY anymore; just hang out all day at Balinda's corpse and wonder what happened.
---
solo zf is a pain in the ass if you've never done it b4, doesn't matter if you're good at mage or not. 2 things you have to learn is how far your cone of cold actually is compare to the animation of it, and how far the mobs can reach you, cause if you mistep once you're dead.
---
Also i recommend getting at least 1.7k hp and 4.8k mana before attempting this. You will also need mana pots, healing pots ( must have), and 2 mana gem made because pulls will most of the time always take 2 or more mins.
---
This is the try hard way to level up, only use it if you do BRD for 3 hours and you find yourself spending 1.5 of that getting to BRD and waiting for people to get to BRD.
---
You can taunt while its banished. It will take you to the top of the treath maters on that mob. And i think he wont get extra treath from heals while he is banished
---
And the people not willing to wait hours for an AV queue to pop will start queueing for your WSG matches, doubling your queue times. People are so short-sighted in this game.
---
Talking about the spriests and retardins who watch the tank tank in galv/drek sit at 20℅ hp with shield wall popped and just keeps dpsing.
---
You're ok, boomer.
---
I mean I'm a PvP spec shaman.  30/0/21 and I heal. And can pretty easily Main tank heal as well(though usually I'm on off tank or raid heal duty)
---
Gear means a whole lot more in classic, and back in the day when all these specs were ranked people were not looking up B.I.S lists and running consumables in raids.
---
I also occasionally throw on my dps gear as an elemental shaman. Supposedly we can't maintain mana and are a meme spec. But the reality is raid bosses in the game right now are being downed in sub 2 minutes so it never really matters.
---
And then the whole server dies. Thank goodness your parents still make your important decisions for you.
---
I know I just defended them in another reply, but he deosn't want to spend gold, I think SP can still be decent without consumables, at least in MC
---
50 an hour seems to be what most people say they make once they get it dow
---
I dont understand why people use that running up the wall skip, just make a quick jump slightly further back
---
Yeah a lot of people still don't see the minor convenience of a second monitor as being worth the up front cost of hundreds of dollars along with the added electricity costs.
---
Makes sense. Ive noticed ranks although it might not always be premades? ive seen high ranks from different realms and they seem to have higher chance of winning. Are they doing cross-realm premades? just timing the queue?
---
I tried timing queue with my one friend and we clicked the same time but didnt get the same BG. &gt;.&gt;
---
Its not as easy on horde i guess.
---
What would you possibly spend 40k on? You could raid with full consumes and respec twice a week for five years and not burn through 40k.
---
As a mage, i farm Zf and D/E the greens/blues.  Decent money maker imo.
---
Haha you fuckin monster
---
I thought the gear from 10 and up is what everyone wanted?
---
Wasn't Cdew in the tournament? How's he doing
---
You will probably not hit 60 then.
---
Just finished this grind a weekend ago and I loved it. The first night I died a lot and didn't gain any levels but day 2 I got 6 levels in a session. Once it clicked it felt great and I've never gotten exp so fast
---
For alliance just zerging will win you plenty of games, but for horde you actually have to def, which is the pvp aspect, to have a decent chance at winning. Can't tell if your comment agreed with me or not.
---
Also keep in mind that every time you leave the dungeon and reset their timer is marked, this is for all not just for the first dungeon. which means if you leave the 2nd dungeon at 2:24 and try to do the 7th dungeons at 2.23, you're fucked.
---
I don't know anything about this, but wouldn't number of wins be silly unless each class started with the same number of players?
---
I did six this evening; the first three were Horde victories in twenty minutes or so -- at least one appeared to be a premade dodge because the Alliance only had about fifteen at the beginning of the match. The next two were Alliance premades, they were over in eight minutes each with a depressing horde trashcanning. The third was apparently an Alliance premade but they faltered somehow and  broke outside Drek during the initial rush. The third ended in a Horde victory at about the thirty minute mark while the Alliance were on Drek.
---
Two strategies. You can pick up the less popular items, that are not BiS, and get more bang for your buck, since the competition is lower, or you can compete in the rat-race for the big ticket items, like onslaught, ONY weapons, and so on. If your roster is stable, then getting the early drops of an item usualy costs you more DKP, and you got to be sure you want to pay the early adopter tax.
---
Ffs, you know literally nothing about the circumstances regarding this tournament. There's a huge skill and gear disparity between the classes. The mages and warriors are filled with some of the best players and have the best gear possible. The best shaman plays the worst spec and lost very frequently by virtue of that alone. There's not many good shamans altogether, and none of them are as blessed with as much gear as the other classes. They had to get a shaman last minute that was still using green gear - I don't remember if he won a single fight.
---
There you have it.
---
edit: also, they added tons of rules to make it easier for warriors and everybody else. Warriors are able to use FAP vs. Frost mages, and Warlocks can't use HS, etc.
---
&gt; Arenas were a much more popular version of PvP than the vanilla PvP system.
---
I don't mean popular in the sense that it is *liked*. I mean popular in the sense that only small percentage of players actively played arena. And its going to be much worse this time around.
---
&gt; Also, it's not like they got rid of battlegrounds when they introduced arenas so I'm not even really sure what your point is...
---
They changed the reward system to favor arena. Once you had arena gear, there was no value in playing battlegrounds.
---
Most common tactic is to play during the day and then AFK overnight / otherwise when you can’t play. So he might play normally for 3-4 hours and then AFK while he has some food and watches some shows, play normally again for a few hours, AFK overnight etc.
---
Look at the comment i replied too, then delete your post.
---
I mean, spending your 25 minute queues wrecking alliance at BRM is a good way to break the monotony while maintaining honor gains. It sounds dreadful to sit in AV non-stop to keep up.
---
Can you get the Dishonored title?
---
if you compare to an hour + which is what alot of people said it was back in vanila pre nerf, then i guess it's short ?
---
I know, but only one faction does it on boats and zeppelins
---
Haha okay that’s pretty funny
---
“In today’s SL warlock tournament we have a great matchup... oh wait one of these guys isn’t a warlock, everyone take five this will be over shortly and we can get on with seeing who the best warlock is!”
---
-every dueling tournament that doesn’t have rules.
---
The point is to be entertaining, every sport has a bunch of rules there simply to make things more interesting to watch. Basketball very nearly died as a spectator sport until they added the shot clock for example, cause turned out getting the lead and then just playing hard defence won more games... but it was boring as hell.
---
Every single sport has learned this lesson or died.
---
Yikes indeed.
---
warrior you rude fucking asshole
---
In lfg chat post ‘lf mages zf gy farm’ until you reach lvl 52. Then look in lfg for people ‘looking for mage brd gorshak farm’ . Very doable to get to 60 in under 60 hrs with those 2 farms only
---
what macro?
---
The staff hes talking about is the WC reward lol
---
Going to have to link me to where I talked shit about anyone during PvP.
---
Druids are amazing in PvP, but as a 1v1 class they’re fairly middle of the road so they tend to be a bit meh in duels.
---
Lol.  Classic is anything but more simple than retail.
---
Your post is specific about its wording, and you have peddled a lie. Best to edit it, max rest is 10 days. One level of rest is you calculation not max, therefore by your though process you should only play once ever 10 days.
---
Recommended spec is arms so a slow 2 hander will be your best best dw has to much of a miss rate while leveling due to lack of hit % gear available. Check out the warrior discord fightclub or wowhead that pulled most of its info from the discord
---
You must be really fun at parties.
---
i dont play ret but given a war and a paladin who wanted id give it to the one who already pvp'ed more
---
bre and sulfuras are the best 2 options atm

Unless on stalaag then there are no ally
---
I am at least well rested when I go, and less on edge than a man who only sleeps for 6 days apparently.

believe what you want. Literally find no one talking in global channels, trade, general, etc. Nothing.

But again, believe what you want. (stonemaul, horde, NA)

I literally bought this laptop to play wow classic on the week after classic was released, I'd be shocked if it went bad that fast

Bad day?  It's not my fault my dude.  Work that shit out before you try to talk to people online, ok?  Not a good look.

How does Orc's racial affect Warlocks?
---
alliance , exalted first day
---
thanks horde
---
I make bank with enchanting but I’m also a hunter who can do trib runs so it’s really not as profitable for most other classes.
---
That's because most serious players joined premades and the remaining people are mostly low ranks with 60% mounts or afkers.
---
I pugged as horde and it took a couple of weeks doing about 3 hours per day, starting in week 2.  I  never tried joining premades but from what I've read there is some pretty hefty gatekeeping involved.
---
You need to be a certain rank, have epic mount, certain gear, etc. 
---
Even if it were only epic mount I wouldn't have made the cut.  When I dinged 60 I had enough gold for the AV mount and I wanted the discount.  I can imagine a lot of others are in the same boat.
---
It's not like the requirement to having a second monitor is to buy a brand new 28 inch 144 hz monitor lol, you can get incredibly cheap second hand monitors at thrift stores for less than 50 bucks.

Come on now, if you aren’t playing as if it’s one year from now,  ow then you are obviously not playing the game right, /s.

How is it a dog and a baby don't know how to face the tree?!?!

Unfortuantely, original population data isn't available anymore, but I can find discussions of just how few people were playing. Around 100k during Wrath according to this. At a time where the playercount was several million.

&gt; I believe it would be more popular than back then, especially when most of the player base will be coming from the shitshow of a PvP reward system that is in Classic.
---
Classic would have the opposite impact. It turns off people who want to focus on fair, competitive PvP. When BC comes out that playerbase won't be around.
---
Especially with all the competition. We have MOBAs, hero shooters, and even retail Arena. The competitive PvP genre is packed with options that just didn't exist in 2007. Classic succeeded largely because it doesn't have much competition.

I wouldn't put too much thought into that tbh. Downranking is a complex formula that varies based your gear, raid comp, and what encounter you're doing. 
---
Here are my most used spells ATM:
---
Heal rank 2 - your most mana efficient spell. 
---
Greater heal rank 1 - good to use for incoming moderate damage, like tank hits or incoming ony firevalls. 
---
Max rank renew - only one priest needs this, should only be used with renew talents and on tanks. 
---
Renew rank 5 - general raid hot for warlocks and melee. 
---
flash heal rank 3- my general fast moderate heal. 
---
Mac rank flash heal - my oh shit heal to save someone after I put a bubble on then. 
---
Then again, downranking should change based on your raid comp and gear, as well as the encounter you're doing.
---
Crazy how you could know if someone else was banned, and also knew if they had your items still. I didn’t know you were Dr. Strange.
---
I admit I was being more than a little hyperbolic with the price. You don't need to buy an amazing monitor but buying a cheap second hand monitor sounds like a great way to piss away money. I'd never buy second hand anything when it comes to electronics, especially something that's going to be turned on basically 24/7 even if I am not using it, and especially something as expensive as a monitor.
---
Can u pm me the import)
---
As far as I’m aware both toons have to be zoned and logged in so probably not.
---
I went for the grind just to get the 640g epic mount since I have benediction already
---
You didn't enjoy watching him open his bag and click his sapper?
---
I think you need to read your post again bro
---
Rank 11 and they're 90g i believe. I was just making a joke that the frostwolf is the best mount in the game
---
Most premades without requirements are really bad atm. The good ones require epic mount, decent gear and often rank on top of that.
---
I think you need a break from the game man, if ur not enjoying it i hardly see how thats anyones fault buy yours.
---
That's just classic, it's a bit slow. And it will get a lot slower, too. But that's also what's really good about it. Try not to focus too hard on the end goal but on where you are right now. Take it slow, enjoy the ride and don't let leveling guides or youtube tutorials spoil it for you.
---
SIMPSONS DID IT
---
Needs to be on 2 accounts and both characters would have to be there
---
Stonetalon Mountains, Ashenvale, Thousand Needles, and Hillsbrad are all leveling zones Horde go through before STV that are contested. Ashenvale in particular is actually one of the first zones you run into significant PvP in.
---
It got removed in classic and retail a few months ago.

So copy that webhook url you made for your channel.  
---
Then go back to the files you downloaded from github.  Select the BGNotifier.ps1 file. Right click it and Select 'edit'. This should open up the script to edit. At the top you will see a section that says "CHANGE THESE SETTINGS TO YOUR OWN!**".** Under that is the discord section. Paste in your webhook there and change the $discord to $True. Save that file, then launch it again from the shortcut and it should work.

There are people streaming their whole R14 grind... Check guys like Maitoz/Monkeynews. They're literally honor capping in 4 days, some people might share/bot but if you're efficient enough you don't have to and I promise you the majority don't.
---
As other say ignore the end game specs as you dont have the gear.
---
Go 31 arms as you can ss+ww to get good aoe threat.
---
Old bug actually. Used to work with death grip if one person was on the boat and on person off. I'm sure they could fix it if the knew about this one the same way.
---
When the old one was around death knights would stands on the docks and throw people the sun over and over.
---
Damn funny
---
10/10 Name.
---
That's why I just frost shock kite them mounted.  Half the time they don't even dismount.
---
I don’t agree that this is PS info, because I’m talking the 6% cap into consideration. I don’t think there’s an optimal gear composition that benefits more by having 1 %crit over 1 %hit on the bow slot than it would replacing 1 %hit on another slot. The difference in benefit is generally greater on other slots, stat for stat. If you could provide a comparison of builds, that would certainly make your case, and I’d be happy to be proven wrong. 
---
I still don’t know what the difference is between yellow and white crits. My understanding is that you hit a wall of severely diminishing returns on your white critical hit chance at a certain percentage, which can be reached right now. If this wall is a result of %hit, which I don’t think it is, then I could see your point about white vs yellow crit because of HS cancelling.
---
Dude, you’re way too helpful. Thanks, I really appreciate it
---
Seems to happen every single game I'm in.  Mostly that's because I kite the lieutenants myself, but it's very rare (maybe 1 in 10) where I don't have people helping me do it.
---
Elemental Shaman is literally helpless against a good warlock
---
Sorry but mages are in no way 50/50 against locks. Pretty sure any mage or lock would agree unless the mage heavily outgears the lock.
---
I'm a 56 Human warlock and I walk all over any mages I fight, even undead.
---
What does honor capping mean? If you stop after four days won't some guy get more honor than you? There's a cap to the amount of honor you can get?
---
Aladdin: "I can show you the world..."
---
It's not logic.  That's the problem.  It's just a slogan they all repeat.
---
This guy fucks
---
OK so I may have oversimplified it.
---
Here is the thing though. Everyone gets the honor from lieutenants. Only participants get the honor from HK's. So as long as somebody kills them, I can mske more honor by just pvping.
---
Don’t really *need* blizzard slow to do that. 
---
Wait till you hear about TBC... where blizzard can crit lolll
---
We don't really care about the queue though.  There's about 10 times more alliance telling us we should care about it than there are horde complaining about it.  It would seriously challenge my sanity if I had to set in AV full time with no breaks in between.
---
This is just straight made up haha. Horde recognize premades and make it their only goal to prolong long enough to get the 1800 bonus honor around Balinda.
---
Our max honor/h is not the same as yours either because of our queues. Your max honor is finishing as fast as possible with all lieutenants while ours is actually the 15-25min wins with alot of HKs and full cap.
---
You're also comparing a premade VS a pug like that should tell anyone anything? If you don't win 12 in a row as a premade that would say more about you tbh.
---
just don't skip the level 10 one, and the one that follows it to the main city.. else you wont be able to tame/feed yer pet!
---
I’m just wondering why it didn’t pan out? I wonder what it would be like, I guess kiting in 3 dimensions could be op... maybe?
---
Yeah but then the one who turtles gets the most honor.
---
It is not about doing the best for everyone. The entire horde except for you getting screwed is the best for you.
---
Tbh. Long queues are better for horde rankers. They can do other stuff while queueing whereas alliance need to constantly fight.
---
Is that the same Pizza from way back in the day? Damn.
---
Don't think so, but in the game manual it says
---
&gt;If you accumulate enough dishonor through your criminal actions, you will be branded an outlaw. As a consequence, you'll suffer experience penalties, lose access to your own faction cities, and become so hated even by your own kind that every faction NPC will attack you on sight.
---
Don't know if that still is the case in 1.12 though.
---
i would strongly recommend getting engineering on the prot warrior. the biggest weakness of warrior tanks by far are their lack of mass-AoE threat abilities and engineering grenades &amp; gadgets such as the [Force Reactive Disk](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18168) help massively in combating this weakness. 
---
for mage tailoring is good but not as much of a must have as engineering for tanks in my opinion, you get some better tailor-only gear choices like [Robe of the Archmage](https://classicdb.ch/?item=14152) or the [Bloodvine Set](https://classicdb.ch/?itemset=421) but if you're just planning on AoE farming on the mage then i'd say it's perfectly fine to pick 2 gathering professions on it.
---
There is no difference in whether you farm the mats or buy them from AH. Its the exact same 100g opportunity cost.
---
Oh. A side raid with scarlet crusade in epl that gives catch-up gear that helps you kill undead ( for naxx) would be smart interesting
---
I get what you are saying but as a mage who spent gold to spec specifically into Winters Chill to benefit the raid and clear content faster, debuff slots are important.
---
It's not that the content couldn't be cleared otherwise, it's just stupid to let that go to waste.
---
Takes less than a minute to sort out debuffs and will save much more time than that when used correctly.
---
Ravager tank with SS + WW. Otherwise buy executioner's cleaver
---
&gt; Why is it pathetic to make a cost/benefit analysis and realize that after getting exalted I no longer benefit from doing AV with the obnoxious turtles that turn a 10-15 minute commitment to over an hour?
---
But that's not even the reality. The reality is, if Horde isn't defending, Alliance will just run from North to South, bypassing every gameplay element Blizzard has placed on the map. They don't cap towers and gtraveyards and they don't even kill Lieutenants and lately even skip Galv. 
---
Then they exploit-pull Drek and kill him. The end. Game's over in 5 minutes. 
---
I don't give a shit about cost/benefit, this is just moronic.
---
getting a pug that used to rush to loss to actually defend and PVP to a slower win is quite an accomplishment in Alterac Valley.
---
You don't need to be 60 to raid MC. As a mage, you are already doing some good dmg at 58/59.
---
I haven't been following, but I'm pretty sure he acknowledged that enh even with hand of rag is kind of hopeless.  You're just going to get kited like warriors, and then hope you hit the lottery if you manage to get close.  I play ele/resto hybrid myself for pvp, and I can't imagine why any shaman would want to play enh in pvp.  It's just crazy frustrating.  It shocked me that shaman was on the bottom, because ele has very strong burst, that's also on demand.  So the above comment was enlightening.
---
AoE Gor’Shak runs it’s an easy team grind at 52. Ofc your gear will trash for 60. A lot more fun than playing solo.
---
I enjoy it more now after reading the other post that shows this was all a set up to waste hundreds of his gold.
---
This just in, nobody cares! Leveling and dungeon are already terrible, why make them worse?
---
What's changed?
---
Easy watson.
---
We all got exalted in the first few days and now your stuck with the people who chose to take their time. Followed by me just PvPing because I'm already exalted and dont care about a win.
---
&gt; You've clearly never used a dual or triple monitor setup have you. 
---
No. I haven't. What kind of fucking idiot would be using more than one monitor and simultaneously saying it isn't worth it to do so?
---
They agree not to go over a certain amount as soon as they get far enough ahead of anyone that's not organizing with them so yes technically someone could but they don't because if everyone agrees it means you don't have to play 24/7 and everyone will still get theirs.
---
There is no actual cap on how much you can get, you just set the "cap" for each bracket and stack on it.
---
There was one, but since HS and spellstone is banned because of SL spec, they did not allow him to use thise to. So thats fucked up, rogue can easily take him down with stunlocks, sad he suffered because of SL warlocks
---
If your goal is exalted for the rewards, and not to PvP , how is it moronic? I thought I would periodically AV after getting exalted, but unless you are a few classes it just isn’t fun. I am saving my PvP time for AB, now that is a good PvP experience. AV is just world PvP and works for the same classes.
---
not possible for a Horde pug to rush win.
---
I love how cute and dumb orcs look. Like a pug
---
make your questing about assisting - about joinging someone's quest as a party member.
---
it's not really a game to trudge through as a lone wolf although some players still absolutely insist on that as their dominant playstyle.
---
I honestly think that in classic druid is one of the higher skill cieling classes.  They also have a couple pretty significant bugs, that shouldn't exist based on vanilla, such as being able to be mana burned in animal form.  A few other fairly crippling batching related bugs.  I'm not familiar enough with the tournament to know if it corrects for these or not.
---
I can only speak from my own experience. I ran the following spec for levelling on a PvP server: https://www.bobo-talents.com/?c=warrior&amp;t=qfrqrryKyLqerCqlryrzqisYslsxsHrArBqmp-rIqjrDrZr0r1r2qhrwIhrJqkqCsyszsAsBqDsmsnsospqFyPyQyRqAqzs-tatbtc
---
For tanking, I start by marking targets and praying to all the gods that my dps play along. I usually LoS pull packs to keep them somewhat grouped, so I pull with my gun and pop bloodrage, followed by a quick battle shout that hits as many people and pets as possible. 
---
As soon as I can (preferably prior to being hit but that doesn’t always work out) I will use shield block to proc a revenge. The global after shield block I tab to my X target and taunt, then swap back to skull and revenge. 
---
Then I start tab sundering, ending with a sunder on skull and using shield block on cooldown. Skull then gets another revenge, then switch to whatever is running and taunt (X target if there are no runners). From there I kinda just respond to situations within the fight. Intercept+taunt is for saving the healer. It usually works out okay.
---
There is huge gap in druids , some of them did terible, but  2 or 3 very good, so thay they were close to top in all brackets they played, like sodapoppin
---
The mobs in the world already might as well not exist to max levels. Do you really worry about 55 aggressive mobs while traveling? Nope, didn't thibk so. This isnt a good augment against flying.
---
Nah it's other ways to make gold, I still have 500 lotus left :) But I expect to be done with the guide in January. Got an exam to finish first.
---
&gt; What ends up happening is that casting one massive heal permits you to regenerate enough mana during the lull
---
I don't know what raids you're doing, but there's hardly ever a lull period in any fight. You don't want to let your tanks get anywhere near low where one spike from the boss will kill them. The 5 seconds it takes for the regen to start makes it not worth optimizing around.
---
knew a hunter back in vanilla that leveled as MM without a pet, dude was a legend on my server.
---
what? you just use the slam macro and do big dong dps. i'm sure it requires some skill but im pretty sure we have at least 1 slam macro 2h fury warrior in all 4 of our raid teams. i know in mine he was doing top DPS.
---
*sees warrior flair*
---
checks out
---
Do you have any tips for leveling a warlock? I'm at 26 but pretty much quit after trying to find a leveling build but everyone just says different things lol, probably spent close to 30g respecing everytime
---
Play classic
---
It was all a setup my dude.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tDuIGj0sGo&amp;feature=emb\_logo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tDuIGj0sGo&amp;feature=emb_logo)
---
Is there a way to skip the last boss in DME?
---
What changed: Most geared and tryhard alliance quit right after exalted, horde ones still playing for honor (and the ally tryhards premade).
---
There’s absolutely no honor in this
---
Swift Zulian Tiger &gt; Black War Tiger &gt; Swift Mistsaber &gt; Swift Frostsaber &gt; every other mount sucks. It is known.
---
It's almost non-existent
---
&gt; and a hilarious amount of mana used on renew
---
Renew is literally the most efficient spell in our arsenal, and one of the highest HPS if you spread it around. [What are you talking about?](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/7zZVBcK1RTAmywg4#type=healing&amp;fight=64)
---
Does not look like eachother.
---
Different class.
---
Close resemblence on name.
---
This is thin quality post :D
---
Anyone know where I can find a late night raiding guild in the US? Around 11 pm CST would be perfect!
---
You’re tripping bro ^^
---
Originally, the Alliance just tried to bypass the Horde's offensive drive by staying out of the way to rush Drek. That stopped working, so now they mow through it.
---
The best [tool](https://tegas.github.io/legacy-sim/#/spell) for healing.
---
Any idea is this intended or not? I don't remember that we could ever do that.
---
I would advise against paid add-ons, there are plenty free ones out there.
---
"Questie" is generally seen as the best addon for overall questing.
---
If you're a veteran, you can use azeroth auto-pilot (though i guess some beginners might enjoy it as well. It sets a path for you and can take away from the leveling experience, but makes it quicker. Not sure how clean it is for characters already existing)
---
Edit : you can use a leveling guide to get a general idea (or a specific route if you prefer) and use questie for the in-game part. I did that for a bit but sadly forgot the name of the guides
---
its not for rogues, MC is easy enough that all Nightslayer gear is an upgrade over it and BWL is out next month so even additional Bloodfang upgrades over em. Only pvp upgrade for rogues are r14 weapons which isnt that much different from bwl gear and the wrist from WSG but thats locked till bwl too
---
you could just not fight him? not sure what you mean here
---
Because Battlegrounds are not and never should be PvE. AV is supposed to be the "large scale open world PvP with a purpose" battleground. Making it PvE is an an abominable corruption of what it's supposed to be.
---
Is he using Treant's Bane? :S
---
Too many crocolisks got an invite to asmonlayer at the same time.
---
he died in a duel? lol
---
I will be buying a better monitor sometime next year so I will be able to see this absolutely life changing experience of having my browser pointlessly open on my other monitor so I can look over at it instead of spending 1 second alt-tabbing to it. Truly a mindblowing experience that I cannot wait for.
---
Get him to 40% and run with a sweetness potion.
---
That cellar is no joke.
---
LOL, this was the first post in months to make me laugh uncontrollably for a solid minute.  So accurate it hurts!
---
Only if you have no idea what turtling actually means.
---
Turtling, by definition, is a passive, losing strategy. "Break the initial charge, then push out" is not turtling. "Commit everyone to defending, with no plan to attack" is turtling.
---
Thanks! 
---
I started using AAP, I found it got pretty buggy and you HAD to follow the regimented route or you would mess up the order. You also aren’t able to open up any interface for it and it caps out at level 40. It seems that progress for it is semi halted in classic as it hasn’t been updated for awhile.
---
Questie is good, but I am looking for the Tom Tom style sort of vibe, I’m unfamiliar with all the quests and I hate having to go back to the same area when I could’ve killed two birds with one stone if that makes sense
---
Purely for honour to rank.
---
It has made me stop at 10 though. Atleast until AB comes out.
---
To be fair, ranked bgs would be better than arenas; WoW PvP is far more balanced across classes in objective-based 10v10-15v15 compared to deathmatch 1v1-5v5.
---
Keep in mind the vast majority of day 1 Naxx guilds practiced for hundreds of hours in PTR first.  Yeah I'm looking at you Progress, Return,  etc. 
---
Really lame in my opinion but it is what it is.
---
what premade discord takes 60% mounts?
---
Do these people realize how expensive the other mats are?
---
Will the ''Tier List'' change in future phases? I've heard stories about Ele shamans popping a ZG trinket and one shotting people.
---
Don't respec until 60, stay affliction/demonology. If you want survivability and help from pets, go demonology. If you want to run around kiting mobs while draining their life, go affliction. Warlock is the most versatile class, and you can lvl it however you like. It's all a matter of taste
---
Striped nightsaber is BiS 60% mount.
---
For epic i like mistsaber more than frostsaber cause i love grey as a colour in general but cant go wrong with white.
---
More like I’m waiting for the healer to drink and the dps starts pulling
---
Why do we counter them?
---
We’ve had the same thing! Thankfully I’m a Druid so I just blow up and feral charge right back.
---
Tbh there's no reason to even avoid wrath. Keeping melee in greatly reduces the chance that both tanks will get booted out and way over compensates for the loss in DPS from having to wear FR gear.
---
Clearly you were not around at all during that time. Rath Strat was a notorious Horde approach to "solve" their problem of always losing to the Alliance. What seems like a no brainer now, in Horde having to defend to win, REQUIRED most Horde players to not only coordinate through VoiP but also use specific addons to win. 
---
Those premades were devastating to Alliance players and literally influenced a temporary approach for Alliance to simply AFK in the cave. What the Horde are crying right now about in terms of how unfair a premade is, insulting the "need" that Alliance has to do that to win, is literally what Horde had to do to simply adapt to the idea of defense. Thus why the hypocrisy of seeing Horde players crying about premades and seeing the Alliance players respond in similar fashion to what was so long ago, is hilarious to me. History is essentially repeating itself. If you don't know Rath Strat, you never knew AV as Horde.
---
i wouldnt recommend leveling as prot, in addition its not really needed at lower levels anyway.   
---
Anger management is one of the best skills for a tank so i would recommend trying out arms. Around 50 you can respec to prot when dungeons start getting harder but until then fury or arms can tank just fine.
---
As a 45 priest what should my general rotation be for healing dungeons?
---
Man, dude can walk through entire buildings after they full on fall on him. What would dynamite even do?
---
If you re daggers you should prioritise crit over anything else if you re capped.
---
I think the point is that u can mine a lot of rich thorium once the doorway opens in his ad phaseand you dont wanna skip that, but the boss only. 
---
Dont know if that works but would be huge for dme runs
---
1.12 av btw
---
with edgies DB+BB &gt; DB+flurry/frostbite
---
LOL, this is my favorite video from classic so far, I can't make it a week without watching it.  Fury is such a trash guild, unfortunate too, I remember back in the early days of Fairbanks subreddit when people were happy the only streamer coming to FB was Skarm because he wasn't as cancer as the rest, then we get Fury the ultimate cancer.
---
Thank you. Is AoE threat that big of an issue? I've tanked most content before, but not until TBC, so I know there were changes. I always got by with rotating my sunder armors around. If it's a necessity, I'll definitely do engineering. But it wouldn't have been my first choice.
---
Druids, how is your life at 60? Do you feel satisfied or are you regretting your choice?
---
The Alliance that are really focused on ranking are running in premades, so you won't likely find them in your pug AVs.  Because of the queue times, a quick loss is better for alliance than a long win, whereas for horde it is the exact opposite.  This means it makes sense for Horde to defend, but not alliance.
---
This post is spot on. Come Tuesday many of the remaining big guilds on Alliance Stalagg are leaving. It's going to be a complete ghost town and the least enjoyable experience you'll have playing WoW.
---
&gt; How is this upvoted?
---
Because its the truth? 2H fury on horde doesnt utilize slam much. You spam hamstring and fish for windfury procs.

youre biggest heal for when you can foresee damage. that way you go out of the 5second rule and start regen mana again.
---
Imagine being in Feralas and seeing a Dwarf phase in and out of existence in a split second like that.
---
As a priest I found it worthwhile to quest as shadow until about 54 then respec to your healing spec and just farm BRD until about 58, then start running scholo/strath/DM. 
---
I never had issues finding a group and I exclusively levelled from 54-60 via instances, getting a lot of my pre-raid BIS along the way.
---
Both perd and cht should always go to rogues unless they all have them. I d give them to sword rogues for offspec before warriors.
---
Not sorry.
---
That blue healer dress is horror. It's just way too good but I'd rather look powerful tauren druid. But well looks like being Disney princess is my destiny for a while..
---
You can clap bad mages by poping a fap while you're charging in.
---
However you will still lose vs good mages probably 80% of the time. They just counter everything you do and it only gets worse when you include things like engineering and consumables. 
---
For example you have fap which is really powerfil and can catch someone off guard. 
---
But.... Mages can pop a lip and sheep you till it's over and then just walk over you. Diminishing returns on sheep isn't really an issue considering mage really doesn't need a reset vs warrior.
---
I do tons of AV and i've yet to see this strat. i've seen people wipe us at balinda but thats it. just a quick wipe, zerg south as always.
---
Yes. Extremely viable especially if you can get a strong 2h like bre, obe or even hand of rag. But you have to use the slam macro so you don't lose any auto attacks.
---
There's actually already a set of turn in quests for UD slaying gear, you can get 3pcs for every armor type that give a bonus % dmg to undead in P6:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=9333/argent-dawn-gloves
---
Bad, sword rogues detected.
---
What does inviting an alt do. I see people do that a lot. Does it stop you getting locked out?
---
/trinket reset
---
yes. get him to 50% and the imps come out of the cave.
---
you have to kite them on ledge where you jump down from the piller. when they are close to you jump down, run to the cave, on the right side of the cave there is a little ledge, jump on this and mobs will evade.
---
Imps will still aggro you so you can 1 of 2 things.
---
Jump down and nuke imps(doable for priests or mages) then jump up again on the ledge and wait til you loose combat.
---
Or
---
bring lesser invis pots and do the same, except you dont kill imps, your combat will drop for small periods of time. so spam the pot and when you get to drink, wait til they go away and simply run into the cave.
---
there is alot of videos on YT on it
---
at least idiots like this make themselves so clearly apparent in AV we know not to take anything else they say seriously lmao
---
All of which just ignore you because their is zero reason to kill you without the honor grind. Again, this is a non reason to hate flying.
---
That's how it was set up.
---
Tier 4. Has sets for every spec, and uses set bonuses to really prop up underperforming specs. Also old raids should have simple heroic modes that let you get an extra drop, just something easy like MC has 500%hp and 200% damage.
---
As a full time worker I prefer maximising efficiency in the little play time I have so I don't have to spend ages turtling in a BG I don't even want to be in in the first place. But Blizz put that BiS gear behind a BG wall so I'm stuck there until I get exalted.
---
Am bear tank(bis minus heavy dark iron ring), absolutely. Deadmines or stocks in 5 pulls, sm cath takes me 9 to clear the entire instance. At level healers and dps make it much easier/faster. You can use the stairs/waterfall to heal your if needed (jump down, make them run around while you heal).
---
I always tell my minions to wait until over stopped moving to heal/aoe &amp; ask single target to focus runners.
---
Thanks, I appreciate it. Will definitely do that then as draining at my level didn't seem any good
---
regardless if the comms at the end were fake or not, the fact that someone thinks 500g was paid to find the location of this event is hilarious. do you people not know the 50 different ways you can find this info out, for free?

a christmas party event was chosen to be held in a pvp zone, and got wiped by a guild that obviously doesn't like them or whatever. boo hoo. hold it in stormwind next time.

Hey all,
---
Holy pirest here.
---
How can I solo farm gold without changing my spec? Just had to train tailoring up for true faith and it was a massive gold sink. How can I farm some gold?
---
\[ X \] Someone kills prospector  
---
\[ X \] Someone caps SH GY  
---
\[ X \] Someone AFK in mines
---
BINGO!
---
not a necessity. but helps. especially with all the mages running around.
---
if youre only doing instances there is not much in it for you while lvling anyways. 
---
If you plan to farm some inbetwen the instances i would do mining/herbalism until 60 atleast, will help with money income.
---
At 45 you’re probably at Heal Rank 4 or GH1, until max level you’re really only supposed to use your top heal but it can get scary waiting for the tank to get to like 50% to throw a heal. I started downranking early and it worked for me, ymmv. Only use renew when moving and only use power word:shield if someone is about to die. Bind dispel, cure disease and abolish disease and use appropriately. Try to get Prayer of Fortitude, less drinking when you have to buff the party.
---
I spent part of my formative years in the country...some things are pets, others are food.
---
We decide.
---
Either way, they all die at some point.
---
It's a large area but it's not large enough and you can't do things like root -&gt; burst damage -&gt; run and restealth.
---
You're not getting a single paladin buff in a pug AV.
---
Want to grab this soon. Buddy of mine has high praises for it.
---
They already have classic+ it's called retail
---
any more added to the game now will just emulate the problems of retail
---
I have beat the last three alliance premades that tried this strat.  All it takes is for the horde to be relentless and keep picking off stragglers on the way to FWGY, then all out fight again at FWGY where horde can have 30+ to why is typically under 25 by then from alliance.  
---
Alliance, being a premade, will have more HKs by that point, but once you take FWGY back the game just ends.
---
Both dropped for me and a dagger Rogue won them both, then said in chat ‘yay now I should probably spec Sword spec’
---
I’m still not over it
---
Their customer support for Classic is horrible. When I was collecting my pre bis, I won roll for item. It didn't appear in my inventory (got room for that), it didn't come in mail and it was disappeared from boss corpse. I did open ticket and after 4 days ticket was just closed with "Response: No response".
---
Luckily it was item from dungeon and I eventually managed to get that item but just makes me realize this is not Blizzard CS that I've used to solve my problems with. Things have been much better with problems with retail.
---
At that level he should very rarely be using a shield to tank dungeons. SS+WW is the best threat available in dungeons
---
Too much to expect the DPS have a half a brain between them, right ? Thats what people learned in 1-60, the instance damage was so low that you could pull aggro on any number of mobs and simply get healed up, even as a clothie.
---
40-man raid bosses still can kick the shit out of you in split second.
---
&gt;(riding skill for instance being 5 even though it's not a cheap enchant).
---
it absolutely is tho. 
---
And theres so many enchanters because everyone followed youtube videos saying "OMG XXX GOLD PER HOUR STAYIN IN CAPITAL" which drove the prices down.
---
Yeah so long as my luck isn't bad I'm cleaning armory in 3 pulls and the boss. It's pretty great.
---
When I farm SM cath (solo) make I around 40g an hour, more than a third of that is just from pure silver drops, that's a huge amount of gold he's losing out on if he decides to bring anyone for free
---
Or getting shadowweaving on a healer priest.
---
I hate you...
---
(me writing this at work)
---
Really? Id say many are there for fun, just none of these rushers.
---
This is the true answer. People also found then they went to even higher levels of the seals in TBC/WotLK and went back and did the quest for fun, the seals didn't work. So it is definitely seal level specific
---
You mean your healer's or...?
---
I just need to find a bot.
---
You can migrate a lvl 40 character to outland, and they are stuck there, and do 40-60. 
---
Same deal with northrend. We get to do the content, keeps classic alive.
---
Moving a character between BC/WOTLK requires lvl cap and completion of an epic quest using professions and 5mans, visiting high lvl zones, the sort of slog like ony attunement. No mail or shared AH between worlds, creates high value in migrating.
---
Tune content in BC/Wrath for 40-60, raids are 60 and gear is tuned to progress roughly MC--&gt;Naxx. 
---
When you migrate, you get a different talent tree. No cross-pvp. 
---
No flying mounts. Instead, have a profession make catapults and parachutes to get places. Teleporters and zone-locked, 1-time-use consumable flying mounts for those places that need it. 
---
Anyhow, that's my creative shot at it.
---
Other way around I'm pretty sure. No idea how people have the time to fuck around for hours in AV.
---
As a skinner i find this disturbing.
---
He's the very definition of a raging basement dwelling nerd.
---
I had an epic game yesterday that was a full on back and forth from IBT to IWT for ~30 minutes.  Both Lok and Ivus came out at the same time, and the raids battled it out in FoS for a solid 15 minutes while they were both up.  We(horde) managed to isolate Ivus and kill him while keeping Lok alive, and were able to push and end as a result(around 50 minutes total).  But it was an absolutely epic game, as close as AV can be the entire time. We couldn't get past IWB, alliance couldn't get past IBT so we just slugged it out.  
---
It was awesome.
---
As a skinner i find this truly disturbing.
---
No it enables you to reset without leaving an dungeon with ur main.
---
Leadership of the party will transfer after 2 minutes when the leader is disconnected.
---
So make an party with an alt, do the dungeon, logout on the main, log in op the alt, wait 2 minutes and when u see the message " you are now leader" reset the dungeons and log back in on ur main, the dungeon is reset and the main char will have been teleported back to the entrance of the dungeon, or in maraudons case of you scepter in you will be at the bottom of the waterfall.
---
Their weapons look so much better than the caster ones too
---
&gt; Imagine you stole that from a poor hunter..
---
In terms of efficiency both the hunter and rogue are in the same boat on how useful the weapon is for raid tanking.
---
Horde lose the zerg 100% of the time, the map is massively alliance favored.  Horde can only win by defending then pushing north.  We have 25+ minute queues, you can bet your ass most of the time we are going to play to win.
---
much better , even if the horde tryharders are camping the fly near capital cities ( burning steppes , searing gorge and plaguelands)
---
"Much"
---
Slam is for excess rage normaly, not the essential part of that playstyle.
---
Stun only.
---

---
Like the tank ever even thinks about it. He has one button and hes constantly pressing it. The button says: GO!
---
&lt;Pirates of Balls Deep&gt;
---
that's part of the reason public premades suck now
---
Just started my search for brokentooth
---
That sounds great. If you actually ever see Alliance manage to summon Ivus, they did something right given the non-rush adaption of play. Rare, but it does happen. I've seen Lok a number of times so far, but not because Horde wouldn't be able to get through, but because they essentially forced Alliance to have to give up by almost entirely staying on defense for over 40min. There was one occasion where we got the druids to come out but... we didn't have enough cooperation/participation to defend them sadly.
---
It's a command line script that returns your userID.  However it's less than useful information in almost all applications.
---
Warlocks are mushroom
---
For tailoring you can sell bags and do cloth transmutes. You might have more options from your other profession. You could certainly do Mara Princess runs. If you can play odd hours there's always farming elemental fire and essence of fire/water.
---
Of course the Priest mainstay is Lasher farm but you'd need to swap to Disc/Holy.
---
I thought, yeah, typical cookie cutter. But then, wait, that's some large ass cookies...
---
That's ridiculous. Why would a mod be hitting on a girl?
---
Definitely doable, but obviously harder and druids are already less efficient than other healers. Then again you are mostly behind on surviability because your pre raid BiS contains a lot of cloth armor without that much stamina and I can't think of many encounters in BWL that will deal massive amounts of damage to you (unlike the lava packs in MC for example).
---
But as there is usually way less gear competition for druids, getting 2/8 tier 2 shouldn't be that hard to begin with. There are also some BiS items in MC you will use way into Naxxramas (like the shoulders from Majordomo), so I would not recommend skipping that place entirely.
---
Here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQtf0LePpw
---
Ok, who cares?
---
awesome. i gonna use /startattack too
---
You thought you wanted it but you didn't. These forums make Blizzard look like prophets
---
I do. Any challenges?
---
Alliance wont win turtle games. The map favors Horde for turtles, and you can summon Ice Lord while Tree is bugged as hell.
---
I tend to try to the end but once game goes to turtle, you have 5-10 Allies go AFK and steady stream of people leaving the games.
---
o suck it up, horde have been claiming to be "winning" at pvp zerging around in murder balls on heavily dominated servers for weeks.  alliance screws around wiping the horde with a meme strat for all of a few days in a BG with even #s, so i'm throwing some shit talk back for fun.
---
relax karen.
---
It really was an awesome game.  I get why alliance stop giving a shit once the rush is defended with the instant queues and all, but when you the the tenacious group that want to fight for every inch it is awesome.  I wish more people played just to play, instead of for max rep/honor.  
---
Horde aren't any better at PvP on average, half the alliance just afk the second the game goes past 12 minutes it seems.
---
You can do maraudon runs as a holy priest, works even better if you have herbalism. Go into maraudon  (with alt in party), kill tinker and princess (check youtube for guide if needed) log out, go to alt and reset, then repeat :D (takes about 2 mins for alt to get leader)
---
Are you referring to *most guilds* or *pugs* because I don't follow?
---
the pvp learning curve will be slightly harder (you basically just have to learn to hold death coil for wotf pop...) but it's pretty worth it, rather be a class I see in almost every guild recruitment post than Gnome Mage #54478651
---
The guys that have a huge ego are the tanks. They know they can get a new group in a second, so they act accordingly. Its literally like Cartman in South Park, "Screw you guys, im going hoooome", if they dont get their way.
---
If you rush the instance too much, it will eventually cause a wipe. Or force the healer to mass use of consumables. And if you wipe, guess who they are going to blame ? Over the years ive seen people leave for the tiniest things. It literally can be one guy dying, once.
---
Shamans also keep the buff after shapeshifting but it's somewhat useless on them, also you can't mount in skeletal form.
---
Yes... like some people still did speed runs for Mario on NES... those elitist cuks.
---
Priest looks like he's getting ready to fiddle some lil boys.
---
U sound way more egotistical than him just saying, either by letting him die or not this behaviour will cause a wipe anyway
---
your lacking of reading and interpretation skills baffles me
---
&gt;you will get banned eventually
---
hmmmm

Warcraft Classic is not a race
---
by Veqq, Bloodsail Buckaneers

---
I posted my macro and we won 2 out of 2 games.
---
 = ~ ` One Big Deathball ` ~ =
---
 - Wait 15 seconds at SHgy
---
 - If they ride past so do we
---
 - If they hit Belinda we
---
 - ram em from behind
---
 - murk em all
---
Today people started shouting me down with Galv &gt; LTs &gt; FW etcetera..
---
I said you couldn't wait 15 seconds?
---
Holy Flame Wars Batman!  People went bat shit crazy.  Then I talked them down, we grouped up and we won the match.  Here is what I said.
---
This is not a racing game.
---
You have fast mounts so you never loose the Big Deathball,
---
not so you can out run it.
---
Always racing to finish line, to get a pole position for some future game that never comes.
---
People have been conditioned to treat all computer games as racing games for the compulsion feed back loop.
---
It's music.
---
If we wait 15 seconds, team up, and see what they are doing we can always play a song that counters theirs.
---
But if you race to some imaginary finish line, leaving 1/3rd of your death ball behind ...
---
Warcraft is not a racing game, it's music.
---
l2p
---
Can relate.. need to be up at 5am for work it’s  currently 3:40 and I can’t seem to fall asleep
---
You’re not reaching crit cap for yellow hits, white threshold is a lot lower, as far as I know. 
---
The wowhead stuff is pretty much the only stuff I’ve looked at (besides the odd YouTube video),I’d really love to know what is 100% optimal. If there is better/more accurate info out there then I’d love to read it. I’ve also seen the same info in a YouTube fury/dps warrior video (balance between 11/12% crit and your crit %).
---
What about the wowhead guide is so wrong? Not trying to be snarky, genuinely want to know.
---
yeah, which is why this ranking system sucks.
---
but gaming is not like it was in the 90s. this is competitive scene, pretty normal to not have fun while grinding something. the fun comes after you are done with the grind.
---
Seriously, wish I was you on that one lol. The Horde in my games tend to be relentless. Similar to the types of replies you see from time to time here. The objective is to literally starve Alliance of honor gains, rather than to simply play the BG for fun. The amount of HK farming at GY spawns I've seen in such a short time put the many years of play across retail to shame. Like there's no attempt to even cap bunkers for Horde, JUST camp the GY spawns. The level of spite I've seen here and ingame is pretty bad lol.
---
Can easily be done. Spell cleave Zf and aoe farm once that stops being effective.
---
How do you got the Diablo companion?
---
They no doubt are... but without human intervention, which will will **never** get, it's not easy to actually enforce. You can be completely and legitimately contributing to AV by sitting at your base and defending it the entire game. A rogue could go to Drek or Van, stealth, and wait. That is a *legitimate* (if not advisable) way for someone to play. Remember the only thing that you're supposed to be kicked for it straight up not being there... the game isn't going to kick you for being bad or for not trying very hard, those aren't requirements.
---
So because of that, it's extremely difficult to automate a system of kicking AFKers that won't accidentally harm legitimate players who might want to be doing some of the other activities in AV without making it very simply for someone to use a bot or even a keyboard macro to get around it fairly easily. 
---
Like I said, they gave us a perfect system. See AFKers, multiple reports, they're gone. Sorted! Unfortunately that system relies on players not being complete fuckwits and that's also not happening so we're stuck with dealing with bots and AFKers.
---
Even the cover was designed by a programmer 😅
---
go stopwatch alliance vs horde running to base and see who gets faster. including backdoor.
---
That's not how you pad meters.
---
Go a draintanking build bro, and once you hit 40 be sure to get dark pact. You'll never run out of Mana and easily solo all mobs your level :)
---
The premade discord I'm in is starting to show some cracks with the sheer number of people that have joined. It was very professional and clean just a week ago but now people have to shout "clear comms" multiple times to silence the chatters &amp; complainers before calling a queue. The number of deserters who bail on their premades in turtle games have also overwhelmed the mods to the point where they get away with it and aren't kicked.
---
Suggest you watch this druid pvp vid: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=151WSc-ZCPU
---
It's not even 1v1 but 1v2 and he wins. 
---
Druids are the masters of open world pvp and if played by a good player, will beat any class, period. 
---
I say this as a Spriest and Warlock main, both very OP 1v1 classes, but when it comes to world pvp, you have to respect balance/resto druids and their ability to win through attrition. They can reset the fight but you can't run from them.
---
Somebody probably wrote an addon to automate reporting people and is using it with their teams to kick out the opposition
---
Well the ingredients are literally poison soooo.
---
It never was the case
---
Noone is asking for an automated kick function. We're asking blizzard to ban the people who have been reported dozens to hundreds of times already for clearly botting.
---
D4L &lt;3
---
Good point. I'll save it for Chinese New Year then.
---
Were you trying to say rep gains for horde are shit if they don't defend and accept the loss? I just read what you wrote the way you wrote it.
---
Horde honor gain being lower than alliance doesn't matter at all.
---
Healing in raids right now is really a buzzkill. Either you bring the normal amount of healers, and everyone has so much extra mana that you just spam anything. Or you cutback on healers, but then you have such stacked dps that bosses die in 50 seconds, so you have so much extra mana that you just spam anything.
---
Had a lot more fun healing 5 mans undergeared and underleveled. If you try to heal efficiently in a raid they will literally think you are the worst player in the raid.
---
honestly, it's not surprising.  the larger discords are so crammed now that calling some of the groups you get "premades" is generous, at best.  the amount of 20-22 player "premades" that don't even use discord for it's god given purpose and sit in silence after the word "left" or "right" is said is pretty shocking.  it's like they expect to just que up with randos they've never played with before, follow a cookie cutter strat in silence, and win.  not much different than if you solo que'd into any other pug AV.
---
also, as i said in another comment, i've seen horde use their chat and raid warnings to communicate beyond what some of these "premades" do in voice together.  i have a busted mic atm and had to spam /RWs in a few games today because literally no one would speak.  it can be frustrating at times, but more often than not it's far better than solo queing.
---
As you mentioned it, I will weigh in on the "paid for" addons.  
---
I agree, there are plenty other free ones which are great. But i've used Zygor many times to level (both retail and classic) and it's very very nice especially for warriors or paladins. It gives you perfectly optimal routes and completing quests 1 or 2 levels below you.  
---
I've leveled countless characters over the last 15 years and it's quite nice to use Zygor to switch my brain off, turn on some netflix and just level
---
2 minutes? That’s about 1,5 minutes too long before shadow runs out of mana
---
Are you a mage?
---
Blah blah blah horde players are all stupid, mean soziopaths blah blah blah
---
A perfect example for the rotten state this sub is in.
---
Is that on firemaw?
---
Slam queue and WF fishing are both viable. I believe slam is the best DPS atm but I'm not sure how that changes. 
---
Dual wield is likely better if you have the gear to support it. 
---
Overall I'd say you're going to have to do your own research and compare. It seems very contested on what's the best.
---
wym? you are spreading false information using a discord as source when that discord says the opposite. afraid or being called out for your bullshit?
---
Most detailed 1.13 guide out there is probably [Marrow's recently released compendium ](https://bookdown.org/marrowwar/marrow_compendium/).
---
Glad to hear that other people do this ! I’m a frequent alt tabber :p and I always try to whisper anyone who’s going to miss the zep
---
Horde can't do premades
---
This is correct and I agree blizzard should prevent this behavior, but how would they do it? Remove the ability to que for specific games and force everyone to use the next game available function which everyone avoids because it puts you in turtle that's been going for 30+ minutes already 90% of the time?
---
Oh I'll wait for the healer, but waiting for the mage is where I draw the line. Those suckers are THIRSTY.
---
&gt; bio break.
---
I'm sure that wasn't a thing in vanilla.
---
Who says he/she doesnt?
---
Why what, he made several points...
---
onyxia is not MC. also, no one gives a fuck about ony dps since everyone is doing splits.
---
&gt; which is usually just burst in 30 second windows while cleaving adds with all buffs available and the mother of all RNG on your side.
---
how is this padding? adds are part of the fight. using arcane explosion on domo and ending the fight in 30s is padding to you?
---
I feel like you could say some of us aren’t tech savvy / lazy and don’t want to deal with the set up
---
This is the Way
---
Prot wars have charge?
---
Minimums are about 50 for prison, 52 for arena, 54 for anything up to guzzler, 56 for a full run.
---
Should I drop herbing / skinning and pick up mining and farm this? Im starting to stockpile grave moss which is currently 30s per hoping I'll get some cash when BWL comes up
---
Rhino penis.
---
Seems like our worst possible future is the one you just sucked down: a paid server transfer (after any remaining alliance have been scoured from the world).
---
Maybe we'll visit Bigglesworth next!
---
On the one hand, I've expressed my sympathy for Stalagg Alliance here before, and that stands. With the high server pops, it was always a farce. On the other hand...it's kinda cool to "win the war" and effectively eradicate the enemy. Definitely not the experience I expected, but there's something to be said for novelty.
---
P.S. You might have more success if you weren't "literally" whining on Reddit while PvP is happening (to you) on a PvP server. /hug
---
Some of that contents rewards are still being used at Max level.   So I would have to disagree there.
---
I have a second monitor and are often alt-tabbed. On my second screen I watch some videos and when I have some time between I use my main monitor to look on reddit or twitter for a while.
---
Dive has a great drain tanking guide that is really helpful. It’s posted somewhere on here, I just can’t remember where. Really kicks in to high gear when you get to level 38 (where drain life starts to significantly outperform wands) but you can start drain tanking before then.
---
Nightfin and deviate are my two other go to fish. I usually try to have all three up on the AH to diversify my stock. Any stonescale eels i get go to my alchemist alt to be turned into elixirs that i use/sell.
---
cute, but inaccurate
---
Yup it's exactly like this!
---
If nobody else uses them and we all agree that is fine because it is so easy why not? Like everyone is just clowning around with pvp specs, not using fire res pots on rag, I only eat the food buff on rag, I use random pots I get from trash in dungeons and we clear mc in 90min. Good enough.
---
The PvP hierarchy honestly doesn't change that much over the course of vanilla. If one could make such a thing as a tier list that people could generally agree with (fat chance), I doubt any class would move more than one place up or down throughout vanilla. Hunters might suffer the most as they scale notoriously poorly with gear, but then again, the class isn't played for its DPS in the first place. The classes that are good remain good, the classes that are bad remain bad. The main thing is that DPS increases more than health pools, and mitigation barely changes, so things like flag carrying and living through stunlocks becomes harder toward the end.
---
Bosses at level 63 also have 3% crit suppression, which you need to subtract from your crit chance. 
---
Then there are glancing blows, which account for 40% of your attacks. You can't reduce those. You can, theoretically, only get so far as that all your non glancing hits are crits. You'll be crit capped once during vanilla raiding, though. In Naxxramas. In one specific encounter. ;)
---
It was challenging here and there. It is not now.
---
 Not everyone cleared every boss in WoW. The current mc is an exception.
---
Wotlk raid healing was more skills. This is just sniping off heals with your fastest spell
---
Well yeah the horde should just let the alliance win
---
The trick is to not heal the tank to full, until you are full mana :-)
---
Warlock
---
Are there actually plenty guilds in progression? I dont buy that. I never ever saw a guild recruiting in trade chat that wasnt 10/10 or forming their first raid group (in which they clear mc in one or maybe two days).
---
Lol 8 hr in vanilla. I would join an AV stay for a couple hours, then go to bed and sleep for 8 hours and join the same BG. Would last days sometimes
---
Mark targets with skull, cross, moon and so on. Keybind your marks.
---
Sometimes you need to remind people to focus skull.
---
Skull = kill.
---
X = second target.
---
Moon = polymorph.
---
Charge in, and you want to generate aoe threat asap. Then tab target sunder and revenge. If there's multiple mobs you can just auto attack skull and focus your revenges and sunders on the adds. You will most likely lose aggro on skull so just taunt it back, it should die quick. Don't forget your secondary taunt (Mocking Blow) and your panic aoe taunt (Challenging Shout)
---
Tell your party when you're about to LOS pull, sometimes they don't realize and the whole pull goes to shit.
---
Level and tank as arms, get Mortal Strike.
---
You can tank with a 2h or a 1h and shield, 2h generates more threat and 1h is better for hard hitting/multiple mobs. You can look up macros for fast weapon swapping too 😊.
---
Skarm raid rage clip and the Fury blows up ironforge with sappers against unflagged alliance masses are two of my favorites. Really wish all of Fury would bugger off to Faerlina.
---
lmao but in those competitive scenes actual skill is required. you dont personally need to have much skill in AV, you can just be near fighting and soak up HKs, and will get almost as much honour as everyone else considering how much bonus honour you get. if you are at the top rank in LoL  you are personally skilled and have the ability to coordinate and play in a skilled team. top rank in wow just means that you play the game way too much. and what you do in game to get that is boring and repetitive if you do it at maximum efficiency. I enjoy PvPing, so if I'm in AV I want to do that, not throw games because its most efficient or whatever.
---
FC means flag carrier but given that it doesn't make any sense in this context I'm going to assume OP means flask check.
---
Because blizzard is pretty week on actually punishing people. They get like a 2 day slap on the wrist for probably more money than they would get otherwise. 
---
Also people massively over state the "community" in classic. People aren't going to check a black list sheet every time they go into a dungeon to try to avoid a random person that another random person said ninjad/scammed. 
---
Can you legitimately name 10 people that scammed on your server? No. And pretty much everyone else will forget about it in 2 weeks.
---
2 months later and turns out you were correct lol
---
If you install Questie it'll show you all your available quests on the world map. I know it isn't 'pure' vanilla experience but its a real QoL improvement.
---
When did this change?
---
Warrior is extra thicc
---
There's enough
---
Listen bud theres a lot of pressure to pick a good name. These things take time and consideration.
---
I found out that I can do a single run SM Cath or Library in between AV queues. No longer broke pvp warrior!
---
Also really convenient because you get the free port back to UC to vendor after each run. I skip to the final boss ASAP (obv. clearing the church out before in Cath) and then move backwards towards the entrance clearing the remaining trash until queue pops. Works out to roughly 7-9g per run.
---
No
---
Alright, now let me find a way to know IF THOSE PEOPLE are alt-tabbing so I can whisper them.
---
Tank from fridays brd when I complained he's not letting me drink : You need to use your mana efficiently, it's not my fault you aren't maximizing you're healing while using the least amount of mana 
---
Also tank from fridays brd : This isn't naxx, I don't need to give it 100% of my attention so that's why im not paying attention to whether you're drinking 
---
I decided to stop giving it 100% of my attention as it wasn't naxx and started to conserve mana by not healing him over 50%, my mana was constantly at 80%+ aside from a boss fight or two and in torches, he needed to start using first aid and food so it went quicker /s 
---
We also didn't get through torches because he decided to run through without waiting for me to drink despite the only AOE being my holy nova.
---
Obviously
---
&gt; You’re arguing against something you have no experience with  
---
All I have done is state my opinion but on reddit everybody sees that as making an argument for something so you're forgiven for thinking I am trying to make an argument that one monitor is better than two or whatever you think I am arguing. And you don't need first hand experience with something to be able to form a valid opinion on it. I haven't met a single racist or seen someone being discriminated against in person, does that mean I am not capable of making an argument against racism?
---
If it was a PuG, they were hardly "swiping" the gear. You don't own it.
---
Huh?
---
Just finished in a group that started 7 v 37, danced for a good 10 minutes in the cave before we got wiped.
---
You gotta make a song about how you **do not** diddle little kids
---
I mean premade vs pug should win regardless.
---
do you have a list of shadow resist and hit gear that is enough to not get MD? also what amount of shadow resist and hit is needed?
---
Horde were better off taking down Balinda and lts and letting Alliance win the game. Faster Honor per hour for them and 8min games max.
---
Or alliance are grotesquely underpopulated.
---
Yeah, because people are bored out of their fucking minds and lose motivation to play. It's like next level greifing.
---
You're missing my point entirely. When blizzard relies on the community to tell them who should be banned, it's exploited without fail. 
---
Those who have those reports should be *looked* at for certain, but unless there is some actual proof they are legitimately using a bot and not simply hitting a key every 5 minutes there is nothing whatsoever to actually ban them for.
---
You wanting them banned does not mean they will be.
---
i'm confused, why do druid FC's use noggenfogger?
---
What's a funner raid class: DPS warrior or rogue? 
---
Warrior seems to be absurd DPS wise which seems fun for tryharding. 
---
Rogue seems funner outside raid but less useful as well. 
---
I wouldn't be tanking for raid.
---
stamina is the number one stat for a lock and then int (while lvling) obv make shadow weave and felcloth sets when youre the right lvl. saying stam and int dont increase sustain is not right lol you get a HS and life tap and drain life all of which have gains. Read OP's (Dive's) drain tanking guide
---
GM wont do anything, ticket os useless. Sorry.
---
Which is it? Are they leeches or are they picking people off?
---
Leave the game for an easily obtainable item?
---
Just wait for the ticket. And why (and how) did the priest take it lol.
---
Hey, thanks for the reply, I'm on Mirage Raceway.
---
In a group of 4 mobs I tend to focus on 3 max and let the dps tank the last one. If we got 1 sheep I usually sheep 1 and start tanking skill, then switch to x and unmarked. It is also important to know what to kill first and what can live the longest. Talk to your dps and ask them if you don't know.
---
Another thing is gear, try to get gear with stamina and strengt on it. Stamina alone is not a priority. Also get a good 1h and shield. The mace from ZF is amazing and something I used from 44-60.
---
Tldr if your max heal heals for 400 and you have 100 healing power, downrank to the heal closest to 300. Apply this formula as needed for heals and variations of healing power.
---
Can u post a new link? That one doesnt work
---
I think you should be more excited than anyone else.
---
^me as a healer.
---
The best pet for solo leveling is the void walker. Help him hold aggro a bit for you. Then affliction is great, and use food to get more mana. Also eventually the enemy will come to you and you will then need to wand it to death the last part. This will also help you get mana
---
This. Alliance premades are winning over 95% of games in 20 minutes or less with 2.5k-4.5k honor each game. Horde is adapting to premade strats which are ever-changing and the pugs are getting screwed by maintaining a 2 week-old strat thats been countered for over a week. Theres a few ways to approach the horde defense tactics, but when the group is uncoordinated and filled with people who cant produce or follow clear direction, then you get those results. 
---
Horde also can tell if they're facing a premade by the first encounter... if you see 30+ deathball on epic mounts, they know what theyre in for... whereas pugs are too predicatable and dont know what to do when countered for the first time. Just keep in mind, there is no single strat that will work everytime, but it definitely helps learning what counters work in what situations.. After a couple weeks of premades, I see AV as a game of Chess now
---
big icy guy already dead not funny enough for you? :(
---
I played back in the day dude, over 1 hour today is equal to couple of day's back in vanilla
---
Where is the scroll down menu?the website?
---
To reach rank 9-10 you need to be in top 10/6% of active players (anyone with 15 HKs counts). Considering a lot of people just get a handful of HKs but don't really farm honor, getting top 10% is easily doable even as a casual player. But getting the rank that way will take quite a few weeks.
---
"if i can't get it back probably i will leave the game permanently :("
---
damn, if thats all it takes for you to quit then I dont think this game is right for you.
---
Is it a large server? I'm on a low pop server ATM and haven't started leveling/pvp yet and I wonder how hard is the grind on smaller servers
---
Lol get better DPS. Heal? Are you new?
---
&gt; I don't know what raids you're doing, but there's hardly ever a lull period in any fight. You don't want to let your tanks get anywhere near low where one spike from the boss will kill them. The 5 seconds it takes for the regen to start makes it not worth optimizing around.
---
Basically all Molten Core bosses have similar tick-tick-boom mechanics where you have plenty of time for healing in the manner described when you have other healers responsible for low level healing.
---
It may *feel* like healing is a series of emergencies, but when you break down what's actually happening moment-by-moment it rarely ever is.
---
Especially in UBRS tanks seems to be curious how long and how fast they can go before they die.
---
there's a scope item that does something similar isnt there? orante spyglass or something like that. I gotta look into that.
---
You should probably read the whole thing before making idiotic statements.
---
birdie tells me some smelly ogre might be joining them soon
---
alliance wants the horde to get their bonus honor. horde does not want alliance to get anything. who is now the bad guy?
---
Tips appreciated absolutely means that it's pay what you want. Saying otherwise makes it dishonest. 
---
People running away with mats are scum. I can't believe anyone does that. I had someone who was super nice ask for collateral because they'd heard people get screwed and I understood, but am still baffled people can be that amazingly petty.
---
Really most of this seems to be a server problem, but I've heard from many people that enchanting in general is a grit your teeth and bear it profession.
---
It's not the hp that makes it challenging, it's the mechanics. Yes Chromaggus only has twice the hp of Ragnaros, but if he has his gold debuff your dps is spending a 1/3 of the fight completely stunned and taking damage. Plus he one shots you if you don't hide before the breath.
---
It's not worth the time investment. Just find a raiding guild that suites your schedule. And slowly progress until you're decked out in T2. Which is immensely better than the R10 gear.
---
It's just not worth the time investment. You can spend the same time farming gold or doing anything else.
---
And they cheat their way into Dun Baldar.
---
Rep and XP. Almost got a lvl today 59-60 by doing quests inside AV and then grinding during the wait (Horde).
---
I know I should wait on the AV stuff because of rep, but I think it’s fairly fun, and I need to be 60 Tuesday for MC so...lol
---
You are correct, got that conflated with the 2h enchant. +7 is the one from Vilethorn shadowcasters.
---
This point is so abysmally bad it hurts. "Look at those damn players organizing and communicating! Having a plan is a crutch!"
---
The only thing that titlts me is how often I can disarm horde warriors equipped with Sulfuras in AV.
---
my friend its can be easy for you as i say im a new player ''  i have just a one mounth experience in world of warcraft '' i been trying to get this item since last  week  i saw it for the first time and lost to shadowpriest im trying to do things right my main language is not English but im reading wowhead and try to playing same time prob i pick the wrong class too  try to look of my view please
---
So several mobs have higher chance and some dont ?
---
If alliance actually turtles, there's no way horde is making it past the bridge. Especially with upgraded archers.
---
I think you don’t understand Classic and missed my point entirely.
---
How do warlocks handle mana in the longer fights in AQ/Naxx ?
---
Even on Ragnaros and with potions I life tap about as much as I'd want to.
---
Thank you so much
---
Sigh...
---
On a smaller server, assuming 5k people are actively PvPing, 1.4% of players will be R11+. Which means that only 70 people can ever attain the RP required to be at that rank (excluding people of higher ranks who get downranked due to not putting enough time).
---
Those 70 spots will be extremely more competitive and much harder to penetrate than if the amount of people actively PvPing were triple that number, which would make them 210 or so.
---
This becomes clear if we go to the extreme and go as low as 1k PvPers. Then you ever only have 14 spots that are being completed over. And a casual would NEVER be able to penetrate this barrier.
---
Lower pop servers are better only for R14. Because only one per faction can reach in a week. So the people on the 1k pop realm will find it much easier to go from R13 to R14. But the whole process won't be any easier since they have to maintain their place in the curve.
---
The system is on a curve. The smaller the population, the steeper the curve. And the bigger the population, the smoother the curve.
---
But sure, "*HURR DURR LOW POP SERVER GOOD*".
---
It's almost impossible to premade on horde. You could do it in theory with a ton of players queuing but most of them will still end up in random games. It's still possible in some regions, for instance Russian horde premades actually exist.
---
I can’t fathom why you bother. It’s a mobile game at this point, leave it alone. You don’t need the vanity purples of the last none content patch.
---
Druid item you mean?
---
I hate this culture of reserving items. 
---
and if not getting an item from and east to farm boss is all it takes for you to stop playing, you’re going to have a bad time.
---
If you like retail that’s fine, no need to whatever the fudge bs your talking about.
---
Another tarded reddior with useless theorycrafting wall of text i didnt read. Do you play on two different servers yourself?) Have you actually experienced the difference, or just talking out of your ass?)
---
Lol mental illness, relax buddy its a game 
---
Okay so you will respec in the end ? :) And what about loot, do you take everything ? 
---
I guess the other raid member are having fun carrying your deadass weight, and what about the debuffslot ? Are you the kind of guy who plays with a weapon who takes a debuffslot because its not fun to be opti :(
---
didn't know that and  they gave wrong info to priest its really annoying for me :(
---
you can start farming it.at 44? how do u skeñip the mobs?
---
Played 2 AVs this morning (both loses), got less than 400 rep in total (and I did maybe 10 blood turn-ins as well).
---
Next time you open the game, try actually read your numbers. 80 is not 800.
---
Something I’ve noticed while doing AV is that Alliance players almost never do the turn ins, even 30 minutes into a game it’s super common for the Alliance to not have upgraded units, none of their Gryphon Riders rescued, and no big tree guy. 
---
Is there a reason for this? As Horde, most of our team is constantly turning in scraps/flesh/blood and we get all the cool rewards and a ton of bonus rep every game.
---
Dude wtf don’t tell him
---
You can check out mobs drop tables by using wowhead.
---
i have literally never seen them that low. cheapest I've ever seen is 1600 on the ah. I'm also not dumb enough to buy them, so i don't check that frequently.
---
Not mine, but it's from the original collectors edition.
---
It cost me 10 gold on my server. Your prices are fucked up
---
&gt; getting top 10% is easily doable even as a casual player.
---
This definitely depends on your server. On firemaw EU horde, you'd have to grind 400k honor a week for 3 months starting from scratch to reach rank 10.
---
Do you follow any guides for levelling paths ?
---
You can but you kind of can't. Some of the rare world drops are described as having 0.2% drop rate from certain mobs. It's likely they actually drop anywhere.
---
I’m not a pheasant fucker.... shit.
---
r10 is in no way shape or farm "easily doable" as a casual player, unless your server is extremely non competitive.
---
How on earth did you take 4 months to do 1-47 then 2 weeks 47-60. It'll be a system shock.
---
nah, meta is alliance premades constantly struggling to adapt to the way horde plays for maximum honor/hour, alliance premades could win in 5 minutes if they skipped galv and did a fast drek pull.
---
&gt;gotta love the silent mob-downvoting in this sub, lol
---
the fuck you talking about, you had multiple responses to this along with downvotes
---
Deathfin happened.
---
I absolutely love how all your posts in this sub, since before the launch of classic, sound so smug and self-absorbed while also being completely wrong. It's like you're so stupid that you can't possibly comprehend your own stupidity.
---
I guess I just have to trust your word then. No numbers or nothing. Just the words of a random redditor who provided no actual argument.
---
Please tell me how, i always loose to warriors..
---
no shit, you sleep in the bed you made, horde decided to completely make the game unplayable for minority alliance on pvp servers. alliance proceed to not pvp, horde gets insane que times. only rankers left on alliance are premading cause why wouldnt you lol
---
Dont let one toxic person keep you down mate, you gonna find annoying people in any community, the trick is to just ignore them when they pop up.
---
Hey, i've seen some of the UIs people use - it's nothing short of a miracle that they can see their own character with some of those cluttered clusterfucks of unitframes for party, raid (sometimes even redundant) and various meters.
---
If ranking meant premading wsg trust me they would all be doing that.
---
The fact that p2 happened and now AV is a thing is purely on Blizz. Every player with a brain kept saying how shit p2 was going to be without bgs. And not one of them is having fun in AV.
---
It's simply what they have to do in order to rank. And no, I'm not ranking because fuck spamming AV all day.
---
My biggest advice is to bind pet skills to something intuitive. It felt like a chore managing my pet until I had shift mouse wheel for attack and follow.
---
I used void walker until about level 30, after that I switched to succubus. I was almost constantly juggling 3 mobs, dot and pet tank, dot and fear, dot and send pet. This was always mob level dependent. I usually had immolate, agony, corruption on a mob. I would throw life tap on the feared mob. However I’d the mobs were 4+ level lower than me I would drop 1 dot, usually which has been leveled the least... I also macroed improve curse to my curse of agony let.
---
I only respect once after my voidwalker wasn’t holding agro. I switched to a drain tanking build after that. I did go dark pact, which wildly improved up time. That being said I would probably go less talents in the drain life talents and bump that into succubus damage
---
I'd expect a PVP Paladin to have the +10% resist chance from unyielding faith, on top of shadow resist aura. Again if they "never" use it, they're trash. You can't judge the viability of a class by its bottom 10% players.
---
Well it kinda does. Since clothies cannot roll on leather, mail nor plate. That is what is a problem in my opinion.
---
Yeah,  russians have been responsible for the most losses by far when I'm in premades atm. They just rush vanndar and bug pull him. Game ends at 8 minutes either way, with both factions getting over 2k honor each.
---
This is natural. Blizz expected for numbers to drop off hard after the first quarter.
---
Additionally, the lack of people leveling was a problem in Retail for years. Some features made it less obvious, like LFG, CRZ and Heirlooms. But in the end Blizz just sold level boosts because the leveling experience was no longer relevant.
---
Expect the lower level zones to be ghost towns after a couple more months.
---
Read that Ally use to be the majority faction during vanilla, so much so that, that’s why Horde Zeppelins have guards but ally boats don’t, directly because ally use to camp the zeppelins so bad.  So really it’s only since meta took over the game and Horde have the meta racials that horde are now the majority. 
---
I’m talking out of my ass though, just what I’ve read and thought about
---
I never bothered to do a proper check on it but I heard different opinions on pants: being available from p3 (like must have) to p5.
---
imagine abbreviating world of warcraft to "war" tho. that'd be silly.
---
I mean it isn’t because of time...
---
Continue at least till Wotlk but with heavy feature, content and possibly some lore changes from the original. That way it's cost affective but still fun. Complete removal of all flight and LFG features ofc.
---
Alliance premade ignores horde rushes tho. Russians often beat us by rushing down vanndar in 8 minutes with 35.
---
&gt;The Talents we have right now and workings of spells came with around aq if i rember right.
---
Not just talents, I think they straight up added Death Coil during way into the game.
---
I have played hundreds of games and not seen that.
---
Both need the tank to drop combat, as long as I can get a big heal off before you pull and sit down to start drinking, charge away
---
the actual state of you if you think real min maxers are going to enjoy being in a casual guild 
---
They are gonna hate every minute of every raid.
---
These are always, always, 1227483% rogue weapons first.
---
thats cause, when you pug as alliance, every single match you are lacking 10-15 players at gate opening cause a premade dodged the que, then cause all the competent players are doing premades, you have 25-30 non rankers, afkers, fishers, lvlers, rep grinders, vs 40 horde that sat in a 30 minute que and want to maximize honor and rep gains, it is not even close to a fair fight either way. but all the horde players type on these forums is ''we turtle vs pugs and win everyitime zug zug good alliance premades and play unfair ally bad''
---
I watch them consistently solopull vanndar with all marshals up tho.
---
You're right. Alliance was the majority back then.
---
Just do a game here and there. You don’t need it until lvl 60 anyway. 
---
A win will come. 15g is really not that much gold that would make anyone shoot. Try 100g maybe someone will cordinate it.
---
I think it drops 5g every 30 days regardless whether you respec or not. I had a 45 respec at some point even though I've been at 50 for a while and definitely didn't go 30 days without respec.
---
yea man i post this question becuse someone told me reddit can be helpful but looks not thanks anyway
---
The way I would do it is I would put a random factor into alliance queue. Example:
---
Player 1 queues and gets a 30 second hidden queue.
---
Player 2 queues and gets a 2 minute hidden queue
---
The hidden queue is different for each person every time.
---
This will kill the ability to premade
---
It will increase my levelling speed significantly as I am able to equip it at this level thus I am trying to obtain it as soon as possible. I dont have much gold to offer but at this point I am willing to offer all of it to just win 1 game...
---
Thats exactly the point of an RPG...
---
"getting exalted in 2 days" is definitively not possible anymore, certainly not for horde. Average rep/hour is probably around 800 for horde right now.
---
42999 / 800 = 54 hours of AV.
---
And how can you prove, and I mean prove instead of "it's obvious because xyz", that they're a bot?
---
There's literally a screenshot of Ooze buying the tribal necklace... 
---
You're skipping the 1/50 ways to find the info out for free here.
---
Bet his teef are rotten.
---
I'm a holy paladin and can't relate
---
monkaTOS
---
You clearly don't have honorspy
---
Yes, selling instance runs became more popular. But this is only natural due to two factors. First a lot of players are max level and have most of the stuff they need from regular dungeons, so they start to care about earning gold instead.
---
Secondly and much more importantly there are characters willing to buy the carry. I'd assume this is something you typically do for your alts. On your main you want to experience the content and even more importantly need all the gold you can get to affort your mount and stuff like that. Both is way less relevant for an alt and most characters you see below level 50 are alts at this point.
---
Don't get me wrong, I'd be surprised if P2 didn't scare quite a few casuals away, at least on PvP servers. But what you describe isn't the effect of that, but simply the effect of people playing alts.
---
gotta fight fire with fire dude
---
Got 40 Pages left to finish, that’s a great book, but not for everyone, it’s more about game development than WoW.
---
He’s probably contributing more then 25% of the people inside the BG tho
---
They were added with 1.11 in vanilla, iirc. That was the Naxx patch. So I'd expect them to become available together with Naxx in Classic, last phase. If they come earlier, they'd be absurdly good compared to available PvE gear.
---
I mean gotta rank all night to compete with the bots.
---
Im cutting sleep to 4 hours a night, might be literally dead soon, wish me luck
---
The overpopulated servers are the problem, not the people. PvP servers LITERALLY reward this kind of gameplay, it might even be mandatory if you want to push for rank. I don't get how people still blame this on other players character or their 'toxic behaviour'...
---
What's 'legitimately challenging' is entirely subjective. It might be challenging to climb stairs for a handicapped person, while being a completely trivial task for a non-handicapped person.
---
Granted, MC is no challenge for a lot of raids right now, but we knew that going into classic. If you want challenging raids, try mythic raiding.
---
If you look into the tournament for 3 seconds or even read the comments in this thread you'll see there is an even distribution of classes. At each stage there is the same amount of every class competing to advance you need to be the in the top of your class not the league as a whole.
---
A fury DPS doesn't even have sweeping strikes. It's also perfectly fine for another warr to have aggro on a mob while you tank the others, it increasea the DPS a lot.
---
Are you a Bloodfang memer?
---
Second panel should also have the disclaimer: 
---
*Also me, can't work out why I'm not satisfied with my life
---
Can anyone advise the Mage and Hunter discord’s, please?
---
I've done a lot of arena-anger-golem runs in brd on my main. Yesterday I was tanking such a run on my 56 druid. To my surprise, i somehow managed to aggro the spectating crowd at the top of the arena by just walking there (causing a wipe). I always thought these were neutral, but they were aggressive. Do they turn aggressive by me opening the door to anger, or how does it work?
---
Well if you want to go into the roleplay aspect of 'winning the war', the horde eradicating the alliance actually means a doomed world in the future as from WotLK on they had to work together almost every xpac to take down bigger threats. So in my head canon servers where this happened are gonna be full on scourge worlds in the near future, which is cool af. I would play a game set in that world!
---
They start out as aggressive, but turn neutral when you complete the arena.
---
All tho I agree with botting beeing bad, sharing how other people can “cheat/leach” inside AV won’t make it any better at all.
---
Also I believe it’s against the rules of this sub
---
The default one? Mine just shows everyone's name in green so I can't tell who's who.
---
Fuckery, happening out in SoS too with spiders

---
&gt; i was wondering if its possible to just have 9% hit instead to avoid stat-less edgemasters?
---
It is (if your goal is to still be special capped). Ultimately that is a choice you could make.
---
Exactly what do you mean by possible?
---
Just wear twill set, it’s possible.
---
Warlocks are supposed to lifetap
---
Shaman mirror maybe? Do they even play mirror match ups?
---
&gt; I have been trying to get 1 win on my lvl 51 Hunter to complete the quest in AV that awards the pre raid BIS bow for 3 days now
---
Arguably you could have finished leveling in the time you've spent in AV.
---
I solo'd it with my mage on one acc and rogue on the other, dropped after 54 runs. Having a geared mage makes life easy
---
Night shift life what up
---
Repeatable once a month or repeatable immediately?
---
im not sharing how to do it im jsut raising awareness. i am literally incapable getting my high ranks cos theres a mafia on my server of people that never log off. so i personally dont have a choice
---
That would be hilarious, as if the knife is inherited from caster to caster.
---
I honestly don't care so much, I'll just premade to 10 and go WSG if it doesn't work out. I just personally like AV and like pugging it. If it doesn't work, it doesn't work.
---
Jerk
---
I would
---
It's not free honor. If you commit less to defend LTs, you can commit more to take objectives. In which case you are winning more.
---
Never understood the obsession with edgemaster's ngl. 1k+ gold for an item that only gives 1 overrated pve-only stat.
---
Miss me with that shit.

He didn't get on the zeppelin but hadn't sat down for being afk

I love you CDR

Where did I say the horde should "go easy" on the alliance? Horde #2351 who responded without bothering to read what he's responding to.
---
The backdoor is highly useful as alliance to get wing commander/druid turn ins after the base is taken
---
&lt;3
---
Unlike the horde the alliance is well aware that a quick loss is better than a slow win
---
Most of us got it after 30 plus tries. 3 manned it with a paladin and another rogue. Had not seen it for 20 runs or more and one morning I got it for me and it dropped again after 3 runs for a guildie Warrior I was helping. And I am considered lucky as the warrior had more than 50 tries. So one week is not a big deal. Keep running angerforge runs . It’s even doable as 2 man party as long you have a healer
---
Warriors cant charge in defensive stance
---
The whole reason premading in AV is unbalanced is because PvPers roll horde for ez life racials lol. If we had a 50/50 split in all regions it would be equally viable for factions to premade, and we also wouldn't have had as many problems in phase 2. Any thread on the topic of PvP would've told you that without any faction balance control horde will be favored and be facing the shit end of the stick in terms of queues.
---
depends on class. r10 is bis in BWL for warriors as an example.
---
8hrs a level? No way. More like 4-5
---
but they brought up Towers and i explained why we defend the towers
---
I think it just increases the damage your glancing blows do. Always 40% chance for glancing vs raid bosses.
---
They can on the non-english servers.

I've lost to multiple russian premades in 8 minutes

When I said "not using it" I didn't mean when I was asleep or away from my computer, I meant when I wasn't looking at the monitor.

Man, you really have the patience of a saint.

The guy is obviously not worth your time, just an angry, sad nerd who doesn't have any numbers to back up his nonsense.
---
Unless the Tank wears Cloths it should really matter. You can drink while the rest already moves on.
---
Respec full shadow at 40.
---
Sometimes i'll go out of my way to annoy people who are rude and agressive in video games. Rude people will ruin a raid faster than a person knocking off a better debuff with their own spell without knowing so.
---
futhermore, it seem you think the only purpose to twinking is to stomp on noobs. no. the purpose of twinking is to not lose. every twink that plays, including myself, got stomped by a twink before they knew what twinking even was, and said, fuck that, never again.
---
No, archers will usually be dead at that point.

One rogue/any class can just go solo kill any of them at &lt;5 minutes

The more I hear about the Alliance ranking experience, the more glad I get that I went Horde.  Alliance are forced to premade with angry neckbeards, and can’t take breaks between games or they fall behind in the rankings. 
---
Meanwhile as Horde, we can just pug our way up the ranks, ignore the people sperging out in chat with no real drawbacks, and the 20 minute queues give us time to take breaks or farm stuff so that our honor grind doesn’t just constantly drain our banks.
---
8h?  Pretty sure we had some which lasted multiple days.
---
"Pvping" - haha yeah, in a pve bg.
---
After 8 weeks. Too long for most guilds.

I gotta admit this is the least readable font I’ve ever seen...

I see you hold grudge towards undead. Well you may like to hear that most of the priest in the tournament are troll, while most of the rogues rolled an orc.

At 50+ what are the dungeon level breakdowns?

Can I run stratholme at 53? What about UBRS? I’m lost

They do.

Could someone explain to a noob what the problem with AV is? Isn't it necessary to participate and you can just go afk?

Could you tag that last one as LOUD AS FUCK because god damn my ears are bleeding
---
Just go imp wands then down the shadow tree. Shadow is by far the best levelling spec and can easily heal all dungeons. Respec at 40 for Shadow form. I have never and would never invest in holy like the guy below recommends for faster heals and smites, it makes no sense to me.

I would love to see the unmade Bg that they were doing, I want to see their vision for the emerald dream and it would be nice if there were a couple more raids with tier sets that were on par with T3 that made un-viable specs viable. i want to play boomy but i just cant do it without gear to allow me to do so. Having gear on the level of T3 for all specs would be really cool. also would love for something like the dragon isles to come out that is a max level world pvp zone or at least some of it is.

Really? cause all my games are vs premades

in the alliance discord I saw it was 100% mount only, no exceptions. had several thousand active on it, too.

As if these people have girlfriends haha

Great. Now I gotta find a new spot.

I don't think 'once every x days' quests were a thing in vanilla. Besides the raid timer, everything was either repeatable ad nauseam or once only.

---
When you have a 35" main monitor the 2nd monitor placement is a hassle, not to mention that the only real usage would be having something on there while gaming. Since you can fit maxed out 16:9 vid + 2nd app like discord chat on normal view easy.
---
Well, when they get those HDMI 2.1, proper HDR, 144hz+ 1440p IPS monitors going in 35", i might buy another one and stack them up.
---
Incredibly inaccurate
---
Calm down mr robot
---
Named “Bestinslot” LOL
---
 Just for exalted rep then stopping
---
You get honor even if you don’t participate, so there’s no incentive not to afk. You let other people do the work for you while you collect the rewards. 
---
It doesn’t bother me much once I chose to equate those people with those who are mentally ill and who are too sick to hold a job, rely on others taxes to survive. 
---
I have empathy for those guys and I feel bad for anyone who is so miserable that they feel the need to leech off others in a game that’s supposed to be fun, but they’re so addicted they can’t stop even when it’s boring or miserable for them. That’s pretty sad.
---
Large numbers quit during those dark weeks.
---
Imagine creating an mmo and the devs not coding in the ability for players to jump in the game. Like literally no ability to jump.
---
Stupid stupid shit. Original Guild Wars was absolute trash. 
---
GW2 with the original wPvPvP and the whole server wars was however amazing back in the day and I absolutely loved the server communities that were created around it, with all the dirty tricks (spies on enemy server TS/Vent servers etc) that went with it, amazing communities.
---
ArenaNet were such morons to piss all over the communities and when those pvp communities stopped playing because of being shit on by ArenaNet, the game never recovered. No matter how much they deny it, they killed their own game by shitting on the community that supported them, opting instead to push useless mind numbingly boring pve trash content, "stories" and stupid skins. 
---
I've no sympathy for ArenaNet, they killed themselves out of sheer stupidity and ignorance.
---
there was world pvp if u participated in it
---
Nothing tops the bridge launch for sheer fun, but tower plummets are close.
---
Some ish, levels where the dungeons are comfortable to do.
---
BRD is depending on parts, early BRD about 50/51+, later 56+
---
LBRS is around 54+
---
UBRS 58+, a bit less if it's just Rend runs.
---
Strat is about 58+
---
Scholo is harder, but I'd say 58+ as well
---
DM:E is 56+
---
DM: W/N 58-60
---
When you spend hours farming for broken tooth and its impossible to rename pets, you're damn sure were gonna take our time naming it lol
---
ah, thats why retail is so shit now
---
That's what will happen
---
All the good alliance players are in premades and all the lowbie, alts, casuals, trash players, premade rejects are in ffa.
---
I get mad when every single pull takes 60% of my mana.  I'd just like to get more than one pull done on one mana bar.  DPS harder or take less damage, not neither.
---
inb4 his account is permabanned for "speed hacking."
---
I think he means near the WPL border, where there are argent dawn NPC's.
---
Or throw a snowball at him knocking him off tower
---
See what coming, exactly? Faction imbalance was vanilla as well, people probably knew that. The sheer number of players overwhelming the entire level 60 content to the point where the weaker side couldn't even play is not vanilla.   
---
So how would someone who has only played Vanilla and no private servers anticipate this?
---
Difficult to see how they could prevent this though.
---
Your butthurt is far from subtle.
---
The longer queues get the more we farm kills in WPL / Winterspring / BRD while ally rankers with gear are all sweating it out afraid to stop insta-queueing.
---
What a dumb idea.  The whole point of Classic is the classes are not meant to be balanced.
---
I find that it's usually 35-40 mins on average per win. I wish games were in the 20-25 mins for me.

---
In premades yes - outside premades? Not any more.  Only trash players outside premades so trash games.
---
Yes up to around level 45-50 healing was fine.
---
Nope. It's just a guess. Could very well be 4 or 6 weeks. 
---
Autocomplete never existed. After TBC each new server had AQ already open. I almost got my mount at end TBC transfering to a new server with closed gates.
---
Sure, don’t use it and don’t top the meters- up to you.
---
&gt;I'd rather have faster flight routes and more teleport options, and no flying at all. Completely ruined world pvp too
---
Teleporters tied to long quest chains please.
---
You should have tried ZF alone. I have leveled my mage 43-50 there, doing it in 4 pulls (5 if i pull scarabs).
---
It's not late to learn how to AoE lvl in instances. Check some videos, and then level ZF-DM or ZF-Mara-DM while earning a shitton of gold and learning how to farm gold at 60
---
yeah he needs rank 10 at least for the set but she doesnt even care
---
"Broke Toof"
---
Yeah I wish I could just charge a mage in flight and fall straight to my death.
---
It does, I tested it with some +heal gear I got from clearing some lower level dungeon. Mend Pet healing increased by a few points (5 I think for max rank, it was something like +15 to healing)
---
If you pull it you tank it. 
---
I’ll usually let them have one or two freebies and pull off them but after that it’s all them.
---
Me waking up at 5 AM on my days off to play games on monday. Ugh.
---
It still amazes me how long the horde queue times are. I had on alli side never even a single second of queue time. Is horde really that overpopulated, when taking all servers into account?
---
That's the beauty of Vanilla.  They peppered in these types of abilities because it made then unique.  Thistle Tea essentially a class ability, but they made it a cooking recipe because that's what it is.  Similarly each priest race gets unique class abilities.
---
The idea of a dueling league in really stupid in a game that purposely made classes imbalanced.
---
Just wait till people finish ranking, and decide to have revenge on all those horde turtles that annoyed them for the last few months.
---
If you’re ret it’s the other way around.  You look good while doing absolutely nothing for your group.
---
Been there... Even worse when it’s your girlfriend waking up for work...

If you want to raid and still do stuff outside of raids, get used to respeccing.
---
And by that logic I'm a bot because I got kicked from a couple dozen AV's so I'd easily have a few hundred "reports". The entire reason we lost the ability to remove AFKers/bots ourselves is because player reports are not reliable at all. A bunch of players saying "HE'S CHEATING" does not mean someone is actually cheating.. or more importantly that it can be proven. Avoiding the AFK debuff kick isn't cheating. Moving every few minutes and manually keeping yourself in AV without contributing isn't cheating. Being terrible and moving/acting like a bot isn't cheating. 
---
Blizzard isn't banning paying customers unless they have actual proof, so unless they can detect the software being used to actually bot/cheat? Nothing is going to happen because they aren't doing anything wrong by playing the game that way.
---
Oh and for the record I'm not defending AFKers or bots.. I'm simply saying it's significantly more difficult to "just ban them" than people seem to think.
---
Pitter patter
---
Even underwater if I have to!
---
OK, what could they do that they aren't which won't cause a negative impact to legitimate players?
---
Ugh i've got work at 6 AM, guild advertised as going to 11 server time which is 10 central, nope! Changed to midnight and some change server time so i get to go to bed a little after 11. Still get a solid 6 hours on raid nights at least, usually catch up the next day.
---
Usually around 3k within 10 min games as alliance.
---
Meth coffee?
---
thanks
---
Yep, genral rule is you shouldn't try to solo que as alliance ever, you will lose 90% and get next to no rep for it.
---
That's obviously wrong. 
---
You disconnect from the world, completely, when you're on the flying mount. They remove the sense of scale from the world. And a lot of other things. 
---
Flying mounts aren't only about ganking.
---
Flying mounts are EXACTLY the kinds of QoL that ruined the game. Simple. as. that.
---
&gt; It does, I tested it with some +heal gear I got from clearing some lower level dungeon last night in fact. Mend Pet healing increased by a few points (3 I think for max rank, 5 for lowest rank, or vice versa - it was something like +15 to healing)
---
I'd be happier with rank anything as long as I didn't feel like someone trying to lose in a fucking video game.
---
My advice is park your hunter on the mountain just south of Uldaman with the alliance quest guys. From that rock you can eagle eye all the spawn points.
---
Yeah, although I tend to pull hard and fast, I try not to force my healers to use mana pots. They are pretty expensive, especially in comparison to major healing pots, which I always have with me and will gladly use more or less on cooldown if necessary.
---
I think it mostly depends on the group dynamic. I do dungeons almost exclusively with my guild buddies, and we know each other very well. When tanking with randoms, I'll slow down considerably to see how much they can take and then gradually increase the pace of my pulls.
---
The problem with pre-trap is that it will prevent stealthers and warriors their opener. Which in most cases mean a free win for hunters. Hunters are in an awkward position where they would win most matchups without any limitations to our utility. 
---
So while the rule will never reflect an actual scenario in the game outside of duels. It does make things more interesting. It is needed for balance and entertainment.
---
One thing this subreddit taught me is that for many players 8 weeks of a bad thing feels like a mellenium to them
---
Let me reach you how to be a healer in a fast dungeon. War charges , you heal, as the fights ending you inch towards the front infront of the war, as the fight ends you spam drink, you drink to 75% ish as he charges in and pulls then stand up walk 2 feet and start healing. I have never once had a horrible time healing doing this, a few times I asked the tank to pull back closer to me as I drank so I could heal immediately but nothing ever really bad
---
There's a lot of pressure to pick good names for you children too, but you don't often see a 34 year old guy still named "Human"
---
I’m 100% serious. I am completely addicted to wow and have played daily for 15 years now. I love it and have fun, but there were certain achievements I wanted that I never got because they made me miserable. I hate being carried unless I can return the favor. 
---
But I get it, you want your honor goodies and hate the game and you’re miserable playing so you afk. I just feel bad that you’re not having fun in what is supposed to be a leisure activity, not a job.
---
going for "fast" games as horde with 20min + ques is less honor per hour than full zerg mode.
---
+healing definitely works. I was curious so tested it last night with some green BoE I got from a dungeon run. Mend pet increased by a few points of healing per tick.
---
I’m curious what they I will do to the AQ gates
---
&gt; Once you had arena gear, there was no value in playing battlegrounds.
---
Your memory is faulty. Even with a full set of arena gear you'd still need to fill in about half the gear slots from other sources, the most relevant of those being PvP gear through Honor points.
---
If you're human, swords are still the way to go unless you're running full world buffs. The point of daggers is (1) easy access to weapon skill via ACLG, (2) less weapon competition and (3) faster HS spam when rage capped.
---
Damn, horde and classic go hand in hand with cringy shit
---
it doesn't.
---
I’m a Tauren for reference and ty
---
Horde will farm all the alliance side mats and transfer them to someone's 2nd account with an alliance character via neutral AH so he can turn them in. Not a big deal...still kinda lame though.
---
Why do you believe that increased initial realm choices would of changed the overall faction balance? 
---
# of realms does not change how horde has better PvP racial, how the honor system works, people are inclined to joined the winning side, etc
---
give me  a  soundbank and i will make a trap beat
---
when did that became a thing? i swear i see 10+ "qt" every game
---
But it gives the best pve stat for melee dps.
---
I completely agree with you on this. Luckily this was just a one time thing until now.
---
lmao, nailed it
---
Compared to us Alliance just crying on Reddit because we’re bad at everything?
---
I've done the exalted grind almost 2x now and most of the time Horde just wants to win. There's some pissed hurr durr max rep/honor people here and there but the majority legitimately just doesn't want to lose and tries to work together.
---
One was doing shitloads of damage tho. Or he was very good or the rest sucked.
---
Carrot was bis pvp trinket when av was just a race.
---
hahahahaha
---
I get what you're saying, but you're coming off as more of a douche than the ones leeching in AV.
---
I think its viable for for ZF if its working already. 
---
Im not sure how great it might be for mara. I had a bit of a tough time without blizz when trying to do 3 or more packs. Mainly because how spread they are and the blizzard slow was great for clumping them to gether. Might be worth doing 1 point in there and rank 1 blizz when you are doing the pull down the ramp part
---
Kinda yea, its inefficient to try and win vs a turtle. Kill LT/Commanders and then afk til horde decide to win.
---
You can't send 40 to a lt when by definition people who are coordinated and listen or follow strategies are in premade discords. That was the point of the post. You did not read it or care. You simply want to feel good about yourself by telling me I'm bad. 
---
Which seems to be a trend with the horde here. 
---
But in the end, who is left on dead servers like flamelash and stalagg? It all comes around. It will with this too.
---
Or server transfer to where stuff is more expensive sell all come back with gold.
---
No it doesn’t - it means going to av entrance and wiring there and then trying to gank the other faction around that area for 20 mins.
---
???? it's the most important at 70 lmao.
---
Cool to know that someone else also has heal 2 and fh3 as two staple heals. I agree with this list, but I've never really considered gh1, as I feel like I'm able to let h2 roll until I need h4, and the oh shit max flash heal. So I guess my question is how often do you use gh1? On which fights in MC? Is it worth it (to you) to assign another key bind to it?
---
I remember people were still rushing to do the questline on new servers in early wrath.
---
Just got my alliance warlock 60. Been on 2 raids and how 4 epics. Warlocks are definitely in short supply.
---
Theyre prolly right clicking lol.
---
I am in this boat, really tried to do it in pugs as I enjoy doing my thing. But pugs are soul killers on alliance so all decent players are in premades.
---
You have the largest e-penis I've ever seen.
---
I guarantee you're an undead mage or rogue.
---
1. Put cable in computer next to the first HDMI slot
---
2. Put cable in monitor
---
3. Right click
---
4. Monitor settings
---
5. Expand display.
---
Sorry but please don’t do this. I often play at work and quickly alt+tab when my boss or a co-worker walks in. A flashing icon might be suspicious!
---
Completely agree. Whoever designed 0.5 should have made it still rewarding to get but make the gear at least dire maul level in stats and stuff.
---
Some mobs drop certain recipes and items exclusively yes. Gotta figure out what you want and look it up.
---
r10 is nothing
---
Yes
---
I was doing ZF GY at level 47+ with 3 mages, healer and tank/mob coraller and still wiped sometimes. 
---
You guys that are soloing it from 44 are my heroes
---
I lasted 10 seconds reading. Cringey AF...
---
User uploads fake email hoping to make blizzard look bad, posts the real email in the comments and makes himself look like a fool, then deletes everything hoping no one will notice.
---
mdr g p lu
---
People that only pick people off are leeching off people doing objectives. Because bonus honor is for everyone.
---
I know it's hard being an alliance player and being illiterate, and or deaf/blind, but as you can see by my flair (if you can see), I am infact a Hunter. An orc Hunter to be precise, something I've played since 2005.
---
lmao. tldr
---
It depends on how much rage I have. If you have lots of rage you can use Thunder Clap and/or stay in battle stance for a while and dump your rage below 25 so you don't lose any switching to defensive stance. Also, another tip; before pull, use Berserker Rage and charge instantly after. The first few seconds of a pull is the most important when it comes to tanking, so you generally want as much rage/threat as possible at the start.
---
I don't use Rend when tanking, it is not a very good ability after level 30ish.
---
And as for tab targeting, you can just either make a mouseover macro to use your Sunder and Revenge on other enemies while just autoing skull down. Unless its a boss you don't want to invest too much rage in to a target that will die soon anyway, better just taunt it if you lose aggro and apply 1 or so Sunders to it.
---
LOL I love everything about this post, 10/10
---
Fair point. Either release them earlier or buff them to be actually useful. But we all know it won't happen because of the alleged #nochanges (even though there are 1000 changes made) and because 99% of people don't care about non-meta stuff like t0.5.
---
As an alliance lock in vanilla and classic. This is very much a real thing. I didn't really think about it until I started to play and realized EVERYONE went UD or Orc and PvP is way harder for me this time around.
---
Haha. Good to know. Too bad for all those servers. I have zero pity. It's self-inflected. ;)
---
Oh that is nice for you to be so generous. For me it is good to go at 60% mana...
---
Deontay Wilder is agree with that.
---
TLDR - Unabomber escaped jail, mad some horde guilds formed a coalition to get world bosses, posted a letter expressing his feelings
---
It's a great read.
---
&gt;...are you stupid? At least be consistent. If you’re gonna play the “thought they did but they didn’t” then yeah it’s a relevant point. It’s not that people only thought they did. What they got isn’t what they asked for. Try to keep up.
---
I feel like your confused. No one thought they could get vanilla circa 2006. Even if the released the vanilla client it wouldn't be anything like Vanilla circa 2006. They wanted a release of the game which is Classic and as Blizzard already knew, they thought they wanted it but they didn't. I can't figure out why you think the game would be the same experience as vanilla with millions of players that know everything about the game. The fun part of vanilla was the exploration and that players didn't know everything about the game.
---
I guess he is not joining the premade discord with his real character name, he enter AV with them but stays middle while the rest of the premade just think he is a PU so they don't kick him for the next game.
---
I’m good to go the second I sit to mage water, but that usually is 50-60 by the time they need a heal like you said
---
Where is this movie from? I recently stumbled upon a bunch of gifs with character from 2nd part and now i'm curious.
---
They are useful, just far inferior to other stuff that can be acquired pugging.
---
Exactly this.
---
Enc shaman pvp consists of level 39 and 49 twinks and that’s it.  Even then it’s still a casino - just a little less rigged.
---
Smite is more mana efficient at lower levels. It's more for that than healing dungeons.
---
It's Dire Maul levels for some classes, especially for warriors, but by the time it's released ZG pugs will be a daily thing and it's not ZG levels.
---
Does the solo tribute run strategy change depending on the staff Cho'rush has? Or is it all the same - burn his mana, keep it down, burn the king?
---
There are million changes that "wouldn't affect the game", like guild banks. Not needing to rely one person to have only control to up to 150 ppls combined work or force people to do account sharing to have more access. Or letting shamans to recall their totems.
---
All of their #nochanges logic so far has been, its 1.12 all the way, just release items when they were originally released. 
---
IF they would make a obvious changes to the game, what would be ok ? What they would change or do. Gotta understand the game is run on skeleton crew that doesnt "develop" shit. They take obvious bugs and try to make fixes, test out upcoming phases (i hope). Nothing beyond that.
---
IF they changed anything, they would need to do something to counter the server lag on prime raid days and world buff windows. When raiders spend 45-50 mins in orgimmar to get a onyxia buff working, while anyone near there cant do ANYTHING, it would SEEM something they would try to address on more priority than releasing t0.5 early.
---
I dont know, make buffs come on every citadel, so people are more spread out. Make buff CD timers a lot shorter, so everyone isnt there just before all the raids start, layer orgimmar/stormwind based on server latency/load on prime times (while still giving buff to all layers). What ever it takes to fix this shitshow.
---
Thats because you spewed nonsense from the start
---
Lol "I'm representing all of the horde by remaining anonymous"
---
But the best part is that he says they are hated by the entire horde while having 13 raidgroups.
---
Dude if you habe 400 raiders you dont really need to give a shit about anyone else.
---
No all im asking is blizzard just looks into a report after over 100 players reported them.
---
https://youtu.be/qRuNxHqwazs
---
You are begging for them to stop beating you whether that's a win ot farming honor. You are bad at the game and you are crying because of it. Have you tried getting good?
---
Priorities!
---
Gimme a beat and I’ll lay some write some lyrics
---
I hear you, in truth I tend to avoid bg's as a warrior. 
---
Mainly because PVP imbalance is rather off putting to play through. 
---
Still the bits of PVP I do play in World PVP have been a good bit of fun.
---
I'm pretty sure rogue t0.5 was stupid strong since the bonus swapped around.  Not sure how that would effect gearing though.
---
Worrying about other people being kind wouldn't be an issue if you didnt play at work 😂
---
Thanks!
---
While I know horde did a lot of pvp on stalagg it felt like alliance was doing just as much when grizzly was around.
---
When honor system came out it became nearly impossible to form a BRD group.  BRM was pretty much always locked down by grizzly, at least 4+ days a week.  Maybe they'd get wiped but they would just come back and take it back over.  Horde were never coordinated to take down a group in coms together.  Thorium point was all but impossible to turn in rep or fly into.  Going to diremaul involved multiple deathwalks from the bridge chokepoint becasue at no point in the day were there not 5+ alliance there.  Every time I flew into felwood I was met with either a few rogues ready to murder me or a group of alliance AOEing the flight path.  Winterspring town entrance always had alliance camping from there to the flight point.  Even the azshara flight path became a deathtrap.  All the horde people I knew that were ranking and cared about PVP just sat in ironforge the whole time.
---
The one thing I will definitely say is that alliance had no chance at world bosses because horde actually showed up to those and way outnumbered them.
---
A few negative posts doesn’t constitute the opinion or experience for the masses. My server is huge, active and very fun.
---
Wow getting off at 12:01 crazy night my guy
---
I got AV exalted in just 2 days, the first 2 days AV was out.
---
I played in PUGS only. 
---
Alliance was winning 9/10 games played. PUGS consisted of ppl in full tier 1 gear and epic mounts. We only had very few bads and low levels.
---
There is zero negative for horde to have longer wait times. Honor is counted around how good other players on your faction are. If ya'll stop queueing and horde gets 1 hour long queues, it just makes the grind easier. Though it will lead to more WPvP.
---
Let's giddader
---
Went 5-1 yesterday and steamrolled each game with 3k plus bonus honor in each as Ally.
---
FYI you do not need an addon to change the fonts, you just create a font folder and copy font files into them. They must be .ttf files. This method also allows you change the fonts in the game to whatever you like.
---
I do this but with Black lotus since im hoping it will just increase in price. It has been sitting around 70g per on my server and i check it every day and sometimes see some below 60(usually 1-2) and i snag those. Any time Felcloth is below 2g per on my server i buy back up to 10 since i am creating mooncloth. Not sure what imma do with it all tho i think im at about 12 mooncloth in my bank rn.
---
Sounds like non-dwarf issues to me
---
I did coc kiting in zf from 44ish to 52. In my opinion the crit talents are nice but don't really enable anything you couldn't do without them, where as saving Mana or lowering resists prevents wipes. Of course I did it a little different, I would just chain coc... Once you are in the rhythm it's just so easy and then you have frost Nova as an "oh shit" button.
---
Nice repost :)

It’s not about making sense. It’s about making it enjoyable to watch lol. It’s the same reason a shot clock was made in basketball for force people to shoot the ball instead of running around and putting spectators to sleep. No one wants to see a hunter pretrapping and floating against rogues and warriors the same way no one wants to see a warrior with no FAP against a mage. It just isn’t fun to watch.
---
Ok so looked on warcraft logs and none of the top dps warriors use slam, even with 2h. Your point?
---
You are welcome my random online friend. I hope playing some WoW can ease your stresses!
---
I see the Horde is busy ganking on the boat as usual
---
In TBC when I made my Druid my main and went from being a full time Shaman healer to a full time tank I could pull off some pretty crazy moves shifting out of bear and innervating, cycloneing, and other stuff.  We had better gear, better talents, and just a better overall design for being a hybrid tank.
---
In classic shifting out of bear when tanking pretty much is a death sentence.  We lose a ton of armor, health, and if our health was low to being with (likely if our healer is OOM) not going to fix anything.
---
Rather making sure our healer is full of mana before pulls is the best thing.  Given that many noob healers tend to overestimate their skill at managing their mana.
---
I appreciate the advice, and I understand where you're coming from, but I'm gonna go prot.
---
In a fair world yes. But u cant balance 1v1 any other way, or attempt to balance it
---
Question is how does warrior do anything without FAP
---
Addiction man.  You saw a problem and delt with it.  Stay strong.
---
I don't think you'll be able to get the gold back/items/gear. But you are able to restore characters that you have deleted. I'm at work right so can't research it property but I'd definitely just google about restoring your wow character. Or maybe someone here can provide you with a definitive answer! Usually in my experience cutting yourself off cold turkey isn't the way to go and causes worse withdrawals. Have you tried giving yourself an "off" time? So for myself this is usually around 10/11PM unless a weekend and irrespective of what I'm doing in game I'll hearth and log. (Unless I'm in a dungeon cause I've not noticed the time and it's not fair to impact other players)
---
i had a game with 37 defenders last night, we won in 27 minutes horde got 990 honor. just defend guys how about you try winning, at some point alliance pugs are just going to start defending too..
---
I start doing this at 42,this still able
---
fark I was with you but the loktar ogar is extremely cringe u lost me
---
Yeah but you move on from smite pretty fast, and then its just wasted points really.
---
Regardless of what strategy you employ, capping SHGY is almost never worth it. The only time it makes sense to take it is if you know you will never be able to get around it and have to beat the alliance back the slow way. Taking SH can ruin attempts to cap aid station.
---
You can open a ticket and ask for a deleted character to be restored. Items and gold will be lost forever tho (Unless you're callous enough to ask your friends for gold).
---
Anyway, play some other game, perhaps? Maybe a good single-player game with an actual story? If addiction is one of your weak points, then I definately would not submit myself to a game that keeps dangling shiny objects in front of you.
---
You can recover deleted characters, and do gear restoration, youd be unable to get your gold back unless guildies sent it back to you; but even with all that being the case, WoW Is certainly not worth risking your livelyhood for.
---
Having a plan when the other half can’t, it’s like you’re choosing to ignore the imbalance
---
those pvp addons are just disgusting. can they please remove the possivility so see literally evverything that happens on a chart ??? -.-
---
I feel like retrieving your characters might be possible... maybe. Your gear and gold definitely won’t be returned though since you vendored them. I think someone on this sub posted about a situation in which they tried to redact the decision of selling gear to a vendor and blizzard was basically like “we can’t do anything about that”.  
---
In terms of WoW withdrawal there’s certainly something to be said. It’s a great dopamine release as you go along that’s for sure. You could always start playing again but moderate your playing time to playing after you have accomplished your work tasks. Everything in moderation, even World of Warcraft. ;)
---
Ofc it would need development. Just like any new phase, they have to make the update files, see whats changed and how. The old patches wont work, since you have new clients, new lua systems etc.
---
So you are manually redoing all changes between different patches into a "phase patch". This is obviously done to cut down work for blizzard. Its easier to do 6 phases than 12 different patches. And it combining patches obviously means different times for releases. 
---
So putting t0.5 in with example ZG phase, they would have to pick out all the changes into instances, quests, vendors etc and add that to zg phase.  Who knows if thats even done atm, since its supposed to be launched in phase 5. They are working on the next patch and things related to AQ.
---
&gt;  simply did not work as intended
---
Whos to say that ? If you think fishing ingame is boring and mostly pointless, it doesnt mean it should be changed. 
---
It was hard 5man content for players in vanilla. Nowadays a LOT more people will rock MC/BWL/AQ gear because of pugs. Back then there were none of those, barely few guilds that actually cleared all content. You could BUY MC items, but they did cost a fuckton of (china)gold.
---
Now with better gear by then because you have all theory crafting explained etc, it WONT be that hard. They will be relatively easy to get. Are they worth getting as a upgrade, maybe for some. But for people that do 20mans, no its not content really meant for you. You can do it for fun and competition purposes, but not every piece of content needs to be worth doing for everyone.
---
&gt; Honestly I see very little difference between standing near Battlemasters or between bank and AH in IF now with what I've seen in TBC.
---
BGs are still just released. People are farming rep/honor for gear. That's why. Doesn't have anything to do with the concept of Battlegrounds.
---
&gt; People get out of cities to do 3 things: 1) Run to raids/dungeons 2) Farm shit 3) Gank
---
Also quests, explore and interact with friendly or enemy players.
---
&gt; I fail to see how flying mounts would make any difference except making 1) and 2) faster and 3) a little different but still doable, seeing as people have to be on the ground to actually do something.
---
Problems with flying mounts: Sense of scale. Related to 1, 2 and 3 as well as the things I mentioned. 
---
&gt; The world FELT alive while everyone was leveling and zones were actually populated. Right now? Outside BGs and Capitol Cities it's barren.
---
BGs are still just released. People are still grinding rep/honor.
---
&gt; If people were flying around right now, instead of running around on mounts, I honestly wouldn't feel the difference.
---
Thorium Point, Kargath, Morgan's Vigil and that other place in Burning Steppes. Forget about those. Just fly from Stormwind or Ironforge in a straight line into BRM. Night Elf Island in Feralas? Just fly straight from Dustwallow Marsh into Dire Maul. Dire Maul entrance area? Empty. Avoiding the Ogres while going to the Dire Maul? Forget about it, just fly straight to the portal. Going from Darkshire into ZG? Nope, just fly straight to portal from Stormwind. Wanna farm fire elementals in the centre of Un'Goro but there are people from the other faction competing for spawns? You're safe as long as you are hovering on your mount. Onyxia? Don't worry about encountering the enemy on the way there - Just stay on your mount, mate, you're safe. Need a Thorium Node but it's far up or far down? Don't worry about finding a path, just fly mate. Farming CC rep during AQ patch? Don't worry about the enemy faction just fly straight past them. Wanna keep your World Buffs safe from the competing guild on the opposite faction? Don't worry, just fly straight into AQ with your buffs. Causing havoc in Redridge Mountains or The Crossroads? Don't worry mate, just fly up on your mount when the other faction starts to retaliate. Going through the cave in Booty Bay to enter STV? Forget it man, the flying mount is much faster. You're in Feralas but you don't have Flight Path to Silithus? Silithus is suddenly very very close. Missing any flight paths? Lol kkthx got wings mah dude. 
---
Yeah. No difference at all. /s

Arms for leveling all the way. It's also your best option for tanking while leveling. Slam on your 2h and go to town. Pulls should look like charge-&gt;sweeping strikes-&gt;whirlwind for amazing initial aggro and then swap to battle stance and do damage. I still swap to zerker to ww everytime its up though. Make sure you're using berserker rage too, it's amazing.  Battle shout and demo shout do create threat. When classic was released demo was busted. You don't really need to use this.  Battle shout is good if you have shitty nonelites in a big pull and you want them to immediately focus you instead of your healer, but don't fool yourself into thinking you can spam BS and hold aggro. It's used as a way to get (a little) aggro on mobs and then you need to do other things to hold it.
---
D stance is kinda shit while leveling. You shouldn't be prot, and therefore you don't have defiance, which is where the extra threat modifier comes from. This is really what makes D stance viable for holding aggro. Mobs do not hit too hard (in MOST circumstances) while tanking dungeons and it's easier to just go cleave/ww your way to victory. You ofc still have taunt and mocking blow. Maybe you go dstance on a boss or two because they hurt but for most mob packs it just slows you down imo.
---
That's not how the concept of time works.
---
It fucking sucks for those of us who still need rep, though. I don't care about honor, I just want my lei of the lifegiver and I didn't have the time to grind out the rep in the first week.
---
tbh i just think they’re weird and ugly looking. pointy faces, lank yet somehow muscular and wiry. bad hair/facial hair options. idk though, that’s just me.
---
Can you have it gift me a BRE and onslaught belt plz. Thanks.
---
Sure. But in this case, as an example of the shitty drawings that this bigoted fuck calls comics, it's useful.
---
That's Gehennas
---
This couldn’t be more untrue. I’ve played on 3 servers, Grobb among them, and Grobb had by FAR the most toxic PvP environment of them until BGs. It’s calmed down a bit since then. PvE and socially? Great server. But WPvP wise other than RP skirmishes that are organized, it’s toxic trashbags camping FPs and GYs.
---
I wonder the same thing. I played male nelf priest in vanilla up until BFA where I race changed into void elf.
---
Fairly certain there were a a decent amount of rogues utilizing 4pc .5 even in naxx.
---
That's really more a consequence of classic than the reason for its existence.
---
I made this post a few days ago and got downvoted to oblivion
---
Don't you realize you guys can que as a premade ?
---
Does this gear restoration work in classic? Because I vendored the items, so getting them back would make an easy way to create gold? Selling gear, get the gold, restore items, repeat..
---
First time heard of this and I have to admit I laughed for a few comics. Not because they are true, but stereotypes and such are fun.
---
It takes less than an hour but solid comment, ty!
---
HATE HATE HATE
---
Real life should be prioritized, it's a wonderful game, I think most of us have to deal with the addiction factor. Be strong, take a step back and take well thought decision.
---
#Wrong.
---
Dps warrior bids in bindings he’s getting gkicked ,
---
Why do you play this game. It's clearly not bringing you any joy.
---
In the [log](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/7zZVBcK1RTAmywg4#type=healing&amp;fight=64&amp;source=28) I linked, rank 3 renew (r3r) had a 24% overheal vs 5% on rank 2 Heal (r2h). The thing is, r3r has 8.2 HPM, whereas r2h is 6.11. In that fight I linked, the overheal nerfs r3r to 6.15 which is *still* better than r2h.
---
Now, if your raid has trivialized the content and bosses are dying in 1 minute, then HpM and healing profiles don't matter. Healers become far less useful in instances like that, and chances are you simply have way too many healers for your composition (progression needs 8+ healers, parses need like 3). In that case, do whatever you want; you really aren't needed.
---
Its, “Always Sunny in Philadelphia.”
---
Just the respeccing twice a week would use up half the gold right there...and only leave you with 44 gold a week to spare. Can you raid with full consumes for 44 gold a week? There's absolutely no way.
---
And I don't even PvP, so I'm actually talking about wanting about 144 gold a week for dungeoning alone.
---
The costs go up after MC and they *skyrocket* for Naxx, so really I'm talking about maybe not even flasking until Chromaggus in the early part of Vanilla but spending 400 gold a week for the many raids in Phase 6 and the ridiculous alchemy costs of doing Naxx. 
---
There's also the costs along the way of an epic mount, crafting max capacity soul bags, getting full bloodvine, enchanting new gear constantly, some fun shit like bribing people 500g for their Ony bag roll, etc. 
---
I've already gone up to Skeram twice on two separate servers in the past. I really want to see the end of the game, not worry about money. So yes, about 40,000 gold is what I'd want to say I never needed gold again.
---
Classes having different abilities has very little to do with balance. They designed classes to be fun and unique, not for them to be imbalanced. Imbalance is just a result of them not prioritizing balance to the extent needed to obtain it, not making imbalance a goal in and of itself.
---
The only thing wrong with Dungeon Set 2 was that it was released WAAAAY too late as a means of giving players who don't pvp or raid something to do.
---
The gear sets for some specs is quite nice, and the most notable is the rogue 4 piece set. Other than that the set is quite mediocre compared to even blue items in the phase 5 item revamp / AQ 20/ ZG 20.
---
This is true, although I do think that once people get what they want out of the pvp/honor system we'll see a lot of folks leveling alts. I know in the weeks before BGs released almost half of my guildies would be leveling alts on any given night.
---
You buy 6 beers from Plugger and give them to Rocknot (complete the turn-in quest 3 times). He will break open the kegs and eventually the door is opened
---
I believe you can just log in and click on restore deleted character.  If not a ticket will definitely do it.  Which you know.  Which means this whole post is just you trying to overcome your addiction.  
---
Just stay strong.
---
&gt; I'm less excited about since getting lucky and critting one or two of them to death early doesn't fundamentally alter the risk (in my opinion)
---
If my calculations are right, you could have about 60% crit chance (when mobs are frozen). That seems really high. That combined with the improved crit damage could make the run faster, and safer. Say you pull ~12 mobs. If you make a mistake, (resist) you almost instantly die (with some bad luck). If you can kill 4-5 really fast the chances of resisting/instantly dying decrease by a lot. But I'm not sure about how much a crit would do vs a normal hit.
---
&gt; In my experience resists are the only real problem 
---
Dropping 2 points from Winters Chill into Arcane Subtlety is a really good idea. Thanks.
---
&gt;  I also wouldn't get frost warding
---
I never use frost bold, so that would be a wasted talent. Frost Warding might safe me once.
---
Yes. Like my password used to be Recycle Bin88 for a long time. Basically, you copy anything from your desktop, add a few numbers and you just copy paste that whenever you login. Keyloggers cant steal your passwrods this way.
---
The reason why slam has always been hated is because it resets your swing timer.
---
So the best way to cast slam would be right after your swing timer (auto attack), but slam still has a 1.5 sec cast time or 1.0 with talents, and your swing timer wouldn't start again until you finished casting.
---
This macro and the way classic works allows you to pre-cast slam without it messing with your swing at all, effectively granting you no downside.

My real question is, are horde players ok with this? Seems like it would be disappointing to pick a PvP server just to have it turn pve a few months in.
---
If you have a monitor that big then I agree, a 2nd monitor might be a hassle. Although I would personally still do it.
---
No the cool down is like 1s shorter than the duration.

Even PVP is PVE rn so most people carry about PVE

The problem is that these people will almost certainly have a higher PvP rank than you..... for *fishing* ... *next to the enemy*.
---
The item recovery takes back whatever you got for vendoring it. You need to have enough gold to cover the vendor price to be able to recover the items. Same goes for disenchanting and materials.
---
I'm serious about not knowing if the Item-recovery works. Recovering deleted characters naked isn't a problem, that I'm aware of. But you are also right, posting about this is also a way to vent some of the struggle
---
&gt;You do realize this game already exists, it doesn't need to be created.
---
They changed pretty much everything in the client, servers etc. You need to recreate EVERYTHING. Development doesnt mean creating something new, they need to make sure what the old patches included works with Classic.
---
And sometimes thats even harder than making something new.
---
Shadowguard blackout for president 2020.
---
Best I can think of is if they doing them it must be fun or worth it
---
I left my last guild because they changed their raid times to 9pm. I'm generally in bed somewhere between 10-11 on work nights which is when they were raiding. 
---
It sucks, but you gotta do what you gotta do, there are plenty of guilds out there and I'm sure you'll find one with better raid times!
---
Lol I’m rank 3 too. I’m not even 60. If you don’t understand how much it must suck to have an addiction so bad that you can’t not play, consider yourself lucky. The only reason to afk is because you don’t like AV and it’s not fun for you. 
---
The afkers are spending hours doing something they feel compelled to do. That’s just sad.
---
why would you honor trade as alliance when you have insta queues, lol
---
also you don't honor trade as a full raid cause each HK is not worth anything.
---
use your brain
---
Cool deal guys, ill try and find a way to download some sounds,
---
Because I can't be bothered to discuss the guid fix or not I'll ignore that. But the aggro reset is for everyone not just those hit.
---
alliance dont defend because we dont care about 300 extra honor from winning. we just want to do another for 4k honor asap.
---
Man here I am 3 months in with still nothing past level 40.
---
Haha what a fucking chode
---
Basically you wait to gueue slam until you're about to hit again. It doesn't interrupt auto attacks and the extra hit can trigger WF, again without stopping a white hit.
---
I'm shooting for shoulders/feet as warlock.  2 set bonus is +23 spell power and makes them BIS even over top +shadow wrath BOEs.

If they want pvp they go do BG's. World pvp is only an annoyance so to get rid of that is a big bonus to most.
---
There are a decent number of gnome warriors. Problem is they're all poor or saving for edge-masters still.
---
When are people expecting a phase 3 (BWL) release? January, February, March? Also remind me - what phases are the Dragons of Nightmare and the Darkmoon Faire planned for originally?
---
actual cringe. Also 12 mins to win AV ? What a shit premade lol
---
cant you extract the sounds from an MPQ viewer?
---
I agree, but if the alliance doesn't win in 10 minutes everyone cries turtle. This is an issue with both sides.
---
this used to be my dad when I was living at home working evening shift and playing WoW with colleagues till the morning. My dad once complained I was heating up dinner at 6am while he was trying to make breakfast lol.
---
Horde almost always grabs more honor than that due to people making sure to kill commanders etc. That’s not really representative of our regular AV games unregarding of us winning or losing.
---
Just join a premade discord and snipe a premade number, or ask a 60 who's doing it who you could pay
---
Looks like u/baloneysalami hit a nerve!
---
Shots fired! Man down!!
---
He was sorta right. The retail snowflakes didn't want it, and they left. 
---
But the servers are still absolutely PACKED with players that do.
---
Alliance or horde?
---
Yep you understand the method correctly.  To answer some of your questions though, threat and aggro are not the same. Everyone has different amounts of threat based on what abilities they've done etc. Aggro is who the boss is targeting. Usually that is the person with highest threat but taunt will override that for 5 seconds. Same with mocking blow, challenging shout etc.
---
Wrath of rag resets threat(sorry if I typed the wrong one before, I'm on my phone.) So if the main tank doesn't taunt rag would turn and attack whoever has the highest threat immediately after the threat reset. This could be the tank, or an unlucky DPS who just got a big crit. So the tank will taunt a little before so that he has a few seconds of guarenteed aggro while he builds threat above the DPS. Once taunt wears off hopefully the tank will be on top of threat and the boss never changed targets.
---
The reason you taunt a second or two before is that if you leave it half a second after wrath rag could turn round and 1shot a rogue before you managed to taunt. So it's just playing it safe.
---
Lastly one more tip, if you're going to try this, make sure your fury warriors are using cleave to dump rage rather than heroic strike because it's easy to overthreat. As a DPS, I also stop dumping rage with while the tank is taunting. When execute phase happens you should not rely on just your own threat anymore. You should taunt, then mocking blow, then another taunt, then challenging shout, and then taunt again as soon as possible. This should have the boss aggroednto you for the duration of the execute phase.
---
Good luck!
---
could you not censor the red one? it helps us to identify who to invite and who to ban
---
With scouting for new "talents" he means scouting for people with epic mounts?
---
It's just not possible to hold threat on a full pull if people are AoE'ing, but it makes the grind go by faster. If you're not wiping it's fine. If the mage is AoE'ing and dying or the healer is struggling with mana, tell them to slow down. Tanking in classic is a lot more difficult then retail because you're just shitty compared to the beasts they are in retail
---
Holy for dungeons, Shadow for questing route
---
If they offered faction changes things would balance out extremely quickly. It'd just be difficult to determine how to adjust for shaman/paladin swaps.
---
People are just gonna make ally alts and funnel them mats, it’s really not a big deal.
---
Yes, if it annoys the premades it is worth
---
That works until you have to run the same fucking dungeon 30+ times to get the piece of gear you need. if everyone is used to finishing the run in 30 min and the tank is taking 60+ min, it's a bit annoying
---
Horde doesn't cry. I feel like 25-35minute games with 4,5k-5k bonus honor and HK are the best BGs for Horde. Some Alliance premades are mad that they don't get free PvE Wins and need to play actual pvp
---

What skill level can you start fishing in AV?   Asking for a friend, also, I'm the opposite faction as you.
---
\*laughs in que with friends\*
---
complain? killing hordes trying to backdoor here is a breeze
---
Can't you just avoid this by making the enchanter put gold in trade for the mats, and then him making you put the same amount of gold in trade (plus whatever you are paying him for the enchant) in trade for the enchant?
---
Will BWL be as easy as MC?
---

---
It's tough to blame a population for how the game is setup.  It's setup to encourage the behavior, and you really cannot influence a population by trying to shame them.  The only way is to fix the rules.  Same reason we have laws and a justice system IRL.  It shouldn't be too surprising that 15 year old classic isn't terribly refined in many ways.  Getting on TV or posting on the internet trying to shame people for using the rules to their advantage *simply does not work* no matter you level of passion or hate about it.  You might as well try to push a mountain over with your bare hands. It's entirely fruitless.
---
As a Stalagg horde player, bye.
---
Thanks for your entire faction being a complete non-factor from release til now. Maybe if you weren't all retail shitters you could've competed a little better. Server was 55-45 at release, which isn't bad.
---
Not replying to your post as a whole, but you realize that basically every class has the ability to stun right? 
---
* Mage, warlock and priest all have talents that give their spells a chance to stun. 
---
* All druids have access to bash and pounce, not just ferals.
---
* Rogues are Rogues
---
* Hunters have improved Concussive shot, and I believe certain pets can stun?(not certain)
---
* Paladins and Warriors obviously have a stuns
---
There's a reason that pretty much every class that can be an Orc tends to roll Orc.
---
Haha I wish, trust me a twat like that deserves to be socially blacklisted but it's against the sub rules
---
There's a hunter on my server who keeps fighting me for nodes in EPL and I'm just like "Who the fuck mines for gold as a hunter?" every time I see them. Some people are just stupid.
---
If you're on a PvP server, everyone's advice about shadow is spot on. On a PvE server where you don't need to worry about ganks though, it turns out that Holy Nova/Smite is more dps than shadow (until about 54 where mind flay actually gets good) and has more efficiency in post-combat healing. You don't even have to bother with SW:P.

Caution: bad warrior playing inbound.
---
My warrior is mining/engi. Prot leveling because masochist. 
---
I’ll mark a caster with skull, run in and immediately start tab-sunders. And that’s basically all I do. Sunder until it sticks, then tab to my next target. Pop the rage generator on cool down.  Revenge as available. Interrupt heals. 
---
Shield block spam and revenge spam are my preferred method of burning excess rage. I’ll cleave sometimes, if I’m high on rage but I almost never heroic strike. 
---
Heroic strike would have to be “ok, I’m nearly full on rage. The healers mana is fine.  There are no pats inbound. The mobs are under control. And there’s only one target who needs the damage, because otherwise I’d just cleave”. But even then? It’s more important to me to be lazy and finish the fight with a huge pile of rage so that the next fight goes as smoothly as this one did than it is to get whatever shitty-ass extra 100-150 damage from 3-4 hero strikes and avoid “wasted rage”.  
---
I’ll happily slam my rage down when I get the prot capstone. But hero strike is trash. 
---
Throw dynamite for an area threat boost.  Gauge your parties desire for spellcleave.  If mages are starting aoe sooner, I’ll dynamite sooner. Things very rarely break off. And if they do, there’s Taunt and AoE taunt. 
---
Thunderclap is a little counterintuitive. It slows enemy attacks, thereby slowing rage generation. I’d prefer cleave to it. But I’d be lying if I said I never spammed it just because I could.
---
Oh man I wish you've had my experiences. I've been insulted and even received some threats for playing defense. People claiming that zerging and letting alliance win is te best way to go.
---
It's not as bad as it used to be because attitudes have changed but I still get salty messages every so often from people who think defense is a waste of time.
---
Always sunny memes are the best
---
False statement of the day
---
Are we talking individual DPS or raid DPS?  I'd be more interested in seeing stat prior where the two are compared.  I understand individual DPS is lower with crit &gt; hit, but the benefits of crit should outway hit for the raid as whole in a warlock heavy raid.  Should it not?
---
liar
---
Boomkins:  moonkin form now causes your wrath crits to reduce the cooldown on innervate by 5 sec
---
Optimal play would then focus on balancing starfall and wrath casts to go oom right as innervate comes back up.
---
Or they could spam rank 1 wrath and do crap dps, but hand out innervates like candy.
---
Thank god I am done with the exalted grind and have not witnessed these new horrors.
---
just /ignore them. Majority ive met is fine with the current Horde playstyle
---
I like that minimap border
---
Depends how good you are. If you are not clearing MC in under 2 hours atm, you will probably have to struggle a bit with BWL for a couple weeks.
---
It’s all the same. But if you get the mage Cho’rush, burning mana isn’t a priority as he don’t heal the king.
---
Wait, you mean to tell me that every premade is equal and gets bracket 1? None of them get 2 or 3? WUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUT?
---
Yeah I don’t think blizzard cares about caps at all.
---
Most people I've talked to thinks somewhere in feb or close to.
---
Thanks for the tips. Ive been running dungeons and its really helped me out!
---
You really don't though. Mind flay is pretty garbage in general compared to smite until 54 or so, and it only really shines with maximum Shadow Weaving stacks which you don't get in WPvE.
---
Makes me cringe a little someone who is getting TF doesn't understand why edgemasters are so important

---
Yeah I think the hardest part was the 40s. Not enough good zones where you can set a hearthstone and just bang out a pile of quests. I found myself staring at the world map a lot, thinking “there must be a zone somewhere that I can stack up 10 level appropriate quests.” Plus the damned alliance towns are all in the most inconvenient places.
---
Hope your faction uses an honor cap.
---
Are we talking gearing or fastest way to leveling? Do you play solo or with friends/guild?

Yes but you'll need to bring a Spyglass or Priest for Mind Vision.

I hope not

This is me 5/7 of the week
---
Imagine being such a pretentious little nerd that you berate people for not being as hardcore as you in a game where you dress as knights and wizards and spent multiple hours of your day wasting away instead of banging pussy like a real man.
---
Living Action isn't in the game yet. I haven't tried but PvP trinket should work, since the stun and damage are the same debuff.
---
Do you have a link to the spreadsheet??
---
Still feels very much the same as before minus pesky alliance ganking.. Every once in a while you run into alliance, i consider them near extinct in the wild, and leave them be, others camp them till they log out..
---
 Horde no longer go to ironforge as far as i can tell, here after BG’s came out
---
The general expectation is that the following things will happen to rectify the state of alliance population: 
---
A. Another round of free server transfer will open up moving more away from FL and ultimately killing the realm.
---
B. Realm merge /forced transfer with another medium populated realm
---
 
---
C. Transfers to flamelash opens in hope hardcore pvp guilds want to take up the challenge..
---
As for AQ our guild are watching the situation, and if nothing happens right up to the release we will most likely do a paid transfer..
---
Did this as a 56 Fury DW last night. Full SM Cath clear took 30 minutes but I'm sure I can shave time off. 
---
Here are some tips. 
---
You can easily burn the Wizards, Sorcerers and Monks. 
---
Focus Abbots and Chaplins and interrupt their heals.
---
Defenders, a couple of sunders makes them go quicker.
---
Centurions and Champions are easier if you disarm them. Mograine as well.
---
The Myrmidons are a PITA. Focus them first due to their enrage.
---
Other tips: Use the Stormwind Brie you pick up to regen health as not to waste more expense food. Also, you can make Heavy Silk Bandages and even Heavy Mageweave to save Runecloth. 
---
My warrior has 686 AP unbuffed and 16% crit unbuffed. If you're gear is a little low, you might want to add some sharpening stones/weight stones. Also, Dragonbreath Chilli comes in handy. You can also add a +25 Agi elixir to add extra crit. 
---
The boss fight is pretty simple, kill Mograine, drop Whitemane down until she sleeps you. When you break free of that, you may need to pot. Use a Greater Healing you likely picked up from the trash or try to bandage. Pop Recklessness and focus Whitemane then Mograine. Disarm Mograine if it's back up.
---
I’m a woman so maybe that’s part of the disconnect. Men are sort of socially programmed not to take but to provide and confronted with the fact that the honor they get is not actually free, but paid for by someone else’s time and the realization that the game they claim to love has made them miserable must suck. I’m not surprised people are angry at my POV. I will defend the afk fishers from the horde, anyway.
---
Ahh I see you were talking about the ony fireball that resets threat for all hit. My mistake!
---
It really sucks that solo queuing WSG isn't a viable honor grind. I know as ally I've done about 10 WSGs and probably 8/10 I was up against either full or partial premades. Honestly, I don't blame horde as I would do the same if I had queues to deal with. If I have a nice chunk of time I can put together a premade myself, but if I'm limited I just have to queue for brainless AV because anything else is wildly inefficient.
---
Darkmoon faire kind of looks like a trailer park!
---
Its after the first reset or creation of your 2nd id
---
What
---
&gt;so as the title says, combined with that screenshot i wounder if it still is worth for you hordes to turtle like madman just to annoy us alliance 
---
A lot of us alliance players want long battles as well so we can get some fucking rep.
---
People who wants quick wins/losses are the worst.
---
Haha horde deserved it
---
I mean I'm married with kids and play one day a week, for raid. Hardly hardcore lol. MC is just not hard in any way shape or form.
---
Oof someone's really salty
---
There's spot on the wall once you jump into the arena that you can climb up on and evade bug all the spectator adds. Just have everyone jump and then chill on the wall for 30s
---
This is FB tier memes, yikes.
---
Questing is my absolute favorite part... This is my Classic+, not yours!
---
Excuse me but how the hell did you pull this off
---
&lt;Naga Stole My Bike&gt; 
---
&lt;She Told Me Shes LvL18&gt;

---
&lt;Dead Naga Storage&gt; 
---
&lt;Dude Wheres My Kodo&gt;
---
im not no fuckin nerd
---
wow, I wonder why I even bothered to post anything on reddit. only negative bullshit, everytime..
---
You can get all your gear back I don't know about gold. Google wow classic character restore and they will mail all your gear to you cod at vendor price.
---
Sounds like hell of fun !
---
I would love to live with people who game a lot in their free time like i do :)
---
We just defeated an Ally premade with snowballs. Tried to solo pull drek, I convinced 3 other Horde players, to snowball some marshals to them. Wiped the premade twice, then the 10 player on north slowly captured the bunkers and killed Vanndar. It was a 31min and it was worth every minute seeing a premade lose so much time.
---
If you don't have obvious weak links in your raid, you should be fine. Some bosses actually require individual players to do their jobs. If you're killing rag before submerge, you should be fine on Vael (might have to work on tank aggro). Chromaggus/Nef are steps up in difficulty but nothing too bad. Oh and people have to watch aggro because taunts don't work.
---
Why, are you afraid to many would like them?
---
Darkmoon P3, Dragons P4.
---
Yep, the quality of alliance premades is declining as more and more people are starting to do it.
---
Previously if you got in a premade it was a guaranteed 10 min win, while now its more like a 60/40, and if the premade wipes they sometimes all leave which forces a 50+ min game for the alliance souls that gets to replace them.
---
Some alliance premades are still crazy good tho, my last game where I was lucky enough to be matched in a 38 man premade managed to crush horde through full turtle in 11 minutes (as almost all hordes were defending)
---
How do rogues look in PvP and PvE as classic goes on? Will they scale well with gear into BWL/AQ?
---
What do you do now my friend?
---
Second guy is Charlie from Its always sunny.
---
sort by icon is the most popular sort
---
nah this is just a sad kid that is not even part of the best pre-made discords and its salty about it. no one "scouts" for new talents lmao
---
Lmfao. It really is
---
&gt; When raiders spend 45-50 mins in orgimmar to get a onyxia buff working, while anyone near there cant do ANYTHING, it would SEEM something they would try to address on more priority than releasing t0.5 early.
---
You get that this is only a problem on megaservers, right? 
---
Servers with a reasonable population don’t experience this.
---
There are drawbacks to being on a mega server. This is one of them.
---
I bet he gets mad at alliance defenders, or people who plays AV for rep.
---
Still a thing for some guilds, killing before submerge isn't a big deal imo as long as you still clear.
---
People that post DPS meters in chat are toxic threat machines that choke my rage and bitch at me that I can't Taunt the 5 mobs they hit with chain Blizzards and cause the priest to lose mana keeping them alive and every fight is a struggle. I'd rather have 20% slower DPS and 20% longer fights and save the time by not dying and not have to wait for priest mana after every fight.
---
I got the same book! I was apart of the kickstart for it. Haven’t read it yet!
---
what ? no? You just type orb in the search on AH wtf
---
Goblin rocket helmet is banned, and most shamans are enh, color me surprised. There is no way for an enh shaman to win some of those matchups without a gap closer.
---
Insane amount of projecting in one comment, wild
---
&gt; 60% mounts, specs aren't checked
---
All those same problems on Horde but pile on lack of communication or coordination. 
---
&gt; tank healing, an MT is announced, Bal harassing
---
Haha, must be nice!   It's mostly people whining that the premade just [pushed our shit in at bal at the opener on /bg and that we all should have listened to their one suggestion at the beginning as if that just spiraled the entire PUG into oblivion.
---
Not in this comic, but in many of his other comics and the things I've seen him say. He knows how to tell a joke, and that's what makes it a problem.
---
People will see this comic and think it's funny. 
---
Some will want to see what other comics he's done.
---
Many will see the blatant racism and not touch his garbage.
---
Others will think the racism and racist stereotypes are hilarious and see who else he recommends.
---
Then before they know it they've fallen into race realism, white genocide, anti-semitism, and god knows what else.
---
It's a pipine, and people like him know how to feed it.
---
I know, i stepped away from the edge when I stared into that abyss. Now I call it out when I see it.
---
Parroting as many have stated above, right now, during MC, Slam build using the slam macro is more than viable. 
---
It’s hard for to argue with the numbers, but our top 2 Warrior DPS are both slammers. We have only had 1 DB drop on ony and all the swords are prio to the rogues. The guide that others have posted is spot on. This slam Marco stuff is new territory to explore as it has to do with spell batching which didn’t exist on private servers. In MC, it works very well. Only time will tell how that stacks up against DW in BWL. I didn’t like slam at first either, but started to enjoy it more and more. It’s pretty fun and a bit of a challenge as the timing can be tricky and getting your rotation right requires some finesse. That guide posted above goes into great detail about when and how to use slam for the biggest benefit. Try if for a raid or two, you may find that you enjoy it.
---
C’mon and Slam and welcome to the Jam!
---
Neither confirmed or denied. 
---
There's quite a lot that has never been confirmed, but people state as fact. And Blizz doesn't step up to clear up any misunderstandings like they should. See the keyring in Phase 2 issue.
---
still helps you measure your dick
---
*Sssh, you're not allowed to say bad things about the alliance. They are the victim, period.*
---
We still aren't hitcapped.  We can get 7% if we sacrifice neck slot for star and get all of our god-tier items via BWL.  Not even half way to hit cap.
---
Im doing av for cheap epic mount as i dont know how to grind gold
---
Yeah, i know. I'm just a lonely fuck and its good socialization/gives me something to look forward to each week. Believe me, i've tapped out before in retail, classic is at least somewhat worth the time invested.
---
lol “enginnering”
---
but then you wouldn't get to see any pearls!
---
What? I've literally never heard of somebody sorting by icon. They go up to the search bar and type in 'righteous o' and hit enter. 
---
Beyond that I'm almost certain that everybody with auction house add-ons would be sorting by price relative to the moving price. In which these two items wouldn't ever be close to each other because the pearls would be showing at like 30000% of their going price.
---
&gt; As soon as naxx or even aq comes pug raids won't be possible.
---
Huh, I've pugged full AQ40 runs on private servers without much issue.
---
Even with four zones spawning black lotus every hour there will be a shortage for phase 3 launch month whether it is February or March 2020.
---
Of course. Probably a Paladin too.
---
&gt; Yea it would require a more aggressive playstyle vs a defensive one. The rotation would be frost nova &gt; CoC. So if 1 mob resists frost nova you'll have to kite him around till the frost nova breaks. Of course there's coldsnap but it has a long CD.
---
&gt; I think it's worth experimenting with :) On one hand you can do it safe, but the more casts the bigger the chance of a resist. Or more aggressive, the faster you kill stuff the lower the chance of things going wrong :p.
---
Here's the thing, in my experience the most vulnerable part is when you have one monster running around with all the others novad. you have to time it well so you can loop back and CoC the pack of frozen monsters while the loose monster is still with them, the difference in nova duration and coc refresh is not that much that you have time to get it perfect. On the other hand, if you aren't nova'ing, CoC resists matter less... that monster will get loose, hit you (you won't get dazed because of barrier) and get snared and you can round him right up into the pack. If something goes wrong you can throw which allows you to collect yourself a little. 
---
Overall it doesn't matter much, it's just an intermediate stage you are passing through and it's more art than science... whatever feels right to you is great and if you are mostly successful then I wouldn't worry too much. One thing to consider though, your technique sounds more similar to flamestrike/coc kiting which I never really got into but as long as you have shatter you might just want to batch a flamestrike in with your CoC, should be tons more damage and thus faster pulls.
---
(i think you missed the joke m8)
---
I believe Furbolg is banned because it makes Locks even better than everyone else. Tidal Charm is banned because of its limited availability, especially a few months ago when the league started.
---
Not true. When the TBC prepatch dropped they removed the ranking system (added arena rating system in its place) and added points you could accumulate to buy the gear, everyone got titles for their highest achieved rank.
---
In most cases more Int will be more beneficial.
---
But as I said Spirit is only really good for Priests or  people with a lot of downtime.
---
You can. But “[I am] writing this at work” and “me, writing this at work” have slightly different uses, no? OP’s use is a good example. Another good example might be a photo caption. I was just pointing out that it’s grammatically valid.
---
I think she's explaining it well.
---
People tend to get offended when they believe it about themselves. Rather than admit it out loud, they respond with aggression.
---
@ OP
---
I have a few questions if you don't mind:
---
1. If you have TOEP and there's a disc priest in your raid who can power infuse you, does the 20% from power infusion get buffed from active TOEP?
---
2. I understand that you should use TOEP before applying corruption because your dot will benefit from the temporary spell power boost even after the trinket buff expires. Is it a net DPS gain, however, to re-apply corruption right before the TOEP buff expires despite your previous corruption not expiring yet versus getting another shadow bolt off?
---
3. I have seen some parses where warlocks stockpile soulshards and literally spam shadow burn like 10x on a boss fight. I know this is not a mana-efficient thing to do and you can also make the argument that it won't peel off a debuff slot with how debuffs follow a priority system. But I suppose it will increase your personal parse if you time your shadow burns to snipe improve shadow bolt debuffs and you have the mana to support it without having to life tap. Big brains or stupid?
---
4. Do you think SM/Ruin is underappreciated from a utility standpoint? The imp buff is whatever because tanks are usually buff-capped. But with felguards being able to essentially decurse/cleanse every 8 seconds, I feel that utility can justify the small gap in DPS loss for not going DS/Ruin.
---
&gt; Are alliance on Heartseeker also to blame?
---
Speaking as another person who's deeply salty about pre-bg wpvp:
---
Yes. Fuck everyone who camped BRM for honour.
---
I think there's alot of good servers. Just alot of whiny ass players. Rattlegore was brutal during P2. Corpse dragging etc. Now though it's actually fair most times. Horde mind a went on a rampage in Plague Lands last night and there was alot of skirmishes.
---
We just need another ally Lionheart crafter. This dude bending people over with a 200g charge.
---
If you aren't exalted by now you goofed.
---
It doesn’t really matter mate, go with what looks better
---
It was a combination of a few things that made Stalagg hell for the alliance.
---
45-55 ratio was just fine. But server queues opened up transfers to heartseeker and arcanite reaper.
---
Arcanite reaper was super low pop so not many people wanted to go there. 
---
Heartseeker was already heavily alliance dominated so why the hell would horde want to volunteer themselves for that experience? So alliance transferred and horde remained. Further ruining the ratio before phase 2. 
---
Alliance economy was heavily manipulated by the hardcore private server players that rolled here. Making it difficult to afford anything with your average players gold making ability. Once P2 came out, resources became more scarce and were even more controlled by the rich players. 
---
Being able to afford nothing, farm nothing outside of instances, and get heavily outnumbered in PvP was the final straw for many, and that's how we ended up at the 10-90 ratio. Stalagg is done
---
Don't you generally just go for 9% ? (which is like 90% hit chance)
---
Thats at least what I did on the pservers, as going any higher was just too much of a sacrifice on other stats.
---
Either way, Bloodvine set is obv OP, and the ZG enchants give everyone a power-creep. But besides that you can get better gear in BWL or PvP ranks.
---
Maybe the Hakkar cloak is BIS, but most things I can remember are just "comeback" items that are easier to farm in 20 man ZG
---
Pick a healer or caster mob to die first, mark it with a skull.  Don't bother trying to tank it, let the group just blow it up.  Stun it if it manages to hurt anyone.  Focus your single target threat on the beefier melee mobs.
---
Melee would probably get shit on. How do you make stealth or charge work when mounted?
---
Might as well smoke a bowl. You should honestly never come back. You already made the decision and imo it was the right one.
---
I healed as full enhancement all the way to lvl 40 and switched to elemental and kept healing dungeons from there. You can heal as enhance. 
---
Gear as a warrior for leveling (strength/atk power is best for leveling enh), keep a few int/spirit pieces on the side for dungeons.
---
It's obviously too serious for most players / casuals that enjoy AV as a fun PvP activity.
---
Yet he does make sense, isn't overselling it and is completely honest about what he's doing.
---
The guy in blue made a completely useless and a bit offensive comment, assuming that everybody was thinking like him. If you had to write a line in a movie for a douche bag character, would it be any different ?
---
I don't understand why so many people are making fun of him here.
---
He wants to grind PvP and try to optimize it. What is wrong with that ?
---
Imagine trying to make people feel bad on the internet by saying how much more elite your internet doll is than their internet doll.
---
Farming honor is very team based. Sounds like you haven’t done it.
---
Pls be this guy so i can make fun of you
---
This is why some people hate flying mounts. Beautiful stuff. Gj
---
with the amount of absolutely mindnumbing opinions on this sub I don't assume something is a joke without at least some indication
---
Took me a minimum 15 deaths to get into dire maul North on Stalagg. The horde camping starts at the flight path and didn't end until the instance portal.
---
How do I kill a shaman as a warrior if I cannot burst them with reck?
---
Pretty sure we're talking about lv 60s
---
If you are using a weapon for which you have weapon skill bonuses for, yeah.
---
Project much? I value my time, you should to. Dont waste it in a guild that raids with bad class composition and raid leading. 
---
Unless, of course, you have no life or job and can waste time. Then have at it. I log once a week, raid for an hour and 20ish minutes. Enchant new gear if needed and log out. 
---
Even when we were still in greens and blues we could get sub 2 hours. Learn the shortcuts, don't waste time explaining fights we all did 15 years ago. 
---
If someone dies to a mechanic, warn them once if it happens again kick the dead weight. It's classic, it's not hard. Everyone should know the shortcuts.
---
Everyone is commenting about the shadow route and thought I would give my experiencing leveling as holy. It wasn't as bad as guides make it out to be. Wand and Spirit Tap are key for the questing experiencing early on. From 30+ I spent a lot of it in dungeons and the holy spec was fantastic, the few times I dipped out and quested it didn't hold me back by any means.
---
Long queues and no alliance in the world. Horde deserves it! 🙂
---

---
I’m aware of what our most efficient heals are. What I think most of you are missing (which one other person did already comment), is your focus on HPM in Molten Core is completely unnecessary and misguided, which ends up leading to wasted mana and consumables. Renews will get sniped 100% of the time because the content is trivial and there are 7 or more healers in the raid. My overheal stats for any spell I use are half of what it shows for your healers here. I accomplish the same goal (in similar/less time too with that near 3 min Domo kill), using less mana (and not chugging pots), and overhealing less. But as you said, healing logs as a form of competition in MC are stupid. We don’t run 3 healers, we run 7+ a lot of the time as our second raid group isn’t quite off the ground. My main point was that most priests can’t find a happy medium and don’t understand WHY they are max rank spamming and see streaming priests do this shit all the time. And then they do the same thing in 40 mans with 6 other healers, leading to them spending more money than they need to, overhealing like a beast, and more or less not understanding the difference between a fight like Lucifron and Twin Emps long term.
---
With 30 minute queues are fast 7m wins even efficient for honor anymore?
---
i cant really say im on the other end of the map there boyo
---
I'm surprised the rogue stood there and didn't do anything between your interruption and polymorph. Or was he stunned?
---
Complete with back peddling.
---
Probably because of an older player base
---
Better is relative and everyone wants something different.
---
I was suggesting the *experience* was novel; there was no "accomplishment." As I said in my post, the way server pop exacerbated faction imbalance was nothing like Vanilla (I was Horde on Sargeras) and really jacked the game.
---
yeah realistically not going to happen.  We run a shadow priest and I'd feel terrible taking his BiS legs from him.  Assuming we can reliably get kazzak kills.  Especially since I'd drop them for bloodvine a phase later.  https://classic.wowhead.com/gear-planner/warlock/gnome/AjwSJQAvIFAwAUIwH1JQAFECAAHwAUuvAkl-A0uqBUziBku8B0zjCEzkCUuuCkvPC0vLDEvqDUuzDkmED0uyEEucEjRU P4 setup

Literally one of the biggest DPS jumps dual-wielders will see, called overrated. Ooookay
---
How is this clever ?
---
“Mom, where did my name come from?”
---
“A movie character, Kylo”
---
“It all started when your father liked my Instagram post.”
---
Hey mate - kuzcoWow on twitch (KuzcoMage-Mankrik in game) I've been mass queing in the horde AV premade discord all morning and it's been my most successful day of honor farming @ about 1-2k per hour more because I'm consistently getting into games where we have anywhere from 2-20 people all in the same game. So far id say it works. Pm me for the link - we've had alliance infiltration already 😂 THE WAR CONTINUES !!
---
They are better for warlock than for spriest, as those pants give no intellect which spriest desperately need. Stam is also valuable for locks as it allows more lifetaping.
---
Those legs are also the only item in the game that gets ahead of bloodvine until AQ 40, as they just give such a huge amount of raw spell power.
---
Same. I understand that people don't like the comics (my down votes), but those really aren't the worst kind of comics you can see online.
---
Make "XX gold per hour" is just a clickbait youtube style.
---
I "make 200g per hour" because I spend 1-2 hours flipping in the AH
---
lmao at the editing dude props for that
---

Looking for warlocks and a resto Druid to fill out the last spots on our raid 2 team Sunday/Monday 22:30-01:30, feel free to pm me on Reddit  or msg one of our officers dotterboi or Zappo in game.
---
yes there r, always
---
I mean if that were to happen, they'd probably just trans to another realm. Its not like they are stuck on their server. They'll just pay the same Blizzard-tax like Alliance now and be done with it.
---
He had already lost it.  Lolling that the person who stole it also got robbed.
---
Thanks! Yeah I'm using dual wield swords!
---
It has. There have already been posts about how more organized and also nefarious people are botting multiple accounts at once to clog the top percentages of honor gained so they can manipulate their way to a more clear road for their mains.
---
I had already looted and went to click again when he appeared out of nowhere. I couldn't get the other hits in after that. He was just an a.hole
---
It's basically a stupid Argument from Authority with no way to verify the authority to begin with.
---
Thanks for the response, though i think if they were worried about warlocks to the point of banning items that weakens other classes like hunters they shoulda just banned soul link. 
---
Though the limited availability is kind of a weird reasoning, where do you draw the line? Do you ban all raid gear because some players were lucky and/or got gear funneled to them at the start of the game. Tidal charm especially with layering was way less limited than what something like mageblade is.
---
Ruleset seems really arbitrary
---
I was proud of myself, got off at 10 last night so I could be up at 6 to drive through the ice storm to work. The fact that I consider that a rewardable accomplishment says much.
---
As Alliance rushing is the way to go, almost no queue makes quick games so much better. Those 6 min win are great.
---
As Horde you tend to drag as long as possible to get every objective before winning since you then get to wait for 20+ minutes.
---
Then most horde will try to slow the match and since you don't pick your battles you will sometime have 'bad games' dragging for longer than 8 min. In those specific case of heavy turtling, 12 min seems okay since they claim to break any defensive formation within 4 minutes or less.
---
no shit? i don't how this has anything to do with what i said
---
i thought the reason was just that the class sux, as clearly implied by them being last
---
I was just trolling you with the postscript. :D
---
If you read what I posted during P2, you'll see that I agree with you on the state of the server. 
---
BTW, Heartseeker is a PvP realm.
---
Also, mah karmas! xD
---
And then alliance still lose after a 45m turtle game that resulted in alliance getting a total of 396 bonus honor
---
&gt; All those same problems on Horde but pile on lack of communication or coordination. 
---
There's just as little coordination is what I'm saying. What's being done in an alliance premade is at the same level as someone just using a macro for the strategy (which is literally what the premade does too), the only difference is you can actually expect people to listen, which no one does normally. 
---
Also if it sounds so good to you, reroll. Be part of the solution to the faction imbalance instead of just whining how bad you have it because you chose the dominant faction and choose to stay the dominant faction. There literally isn't even a problem with premades or fairness at this point, the system is as balanced as can be and shouldn't be changed to accomodate an uneven H:A balance. Should just fix the H:A balance instead.
---
It's simple. 
---
Will of the Forsaken and Hardiness are considered the best PvP racials. Most players want to have the advantage in PvP fights, so most people in PvP servers picked the Faction with the best racials.
---
It's why PvP servers are Horde dominated while PvE servers are Alliance dominated.
---
Going with the Game of Thrones naming, I named my kid Smoky Vagina Monster
---
Horde can't premake AV groups
---
We are comparing holy/disc smite vs shadow mind flay. Obviously you aren't going to smite when you spec shadow lol.
---
Rank 3 level 36 mind flay does 186 over 3 seconds. Rank 6 Smite at level 38 does 236 in 2 seconds (faster casting spec). Shadowform gives Mind flay 15% (28) more damage, Searing Light gives Smite 10% (24) more damage.
---
Bug has been here since beta, apparently it was in vanilla too. It has to do with the zone border between Durotar and the Barrens
---
You don't need to coordinate shit because there are more horde PvP players than alliance players so most PvP servers will end up horde favored.
---
 horde win tactic [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WfnkZKM8gs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WfnkZKM8gs)
---
Don't get me wrong, if I can get my hands on a pair I will, but our fights are so short our spriest doesn't have an issue with mana since he chugs demonic runes and mana pots.
---
Its partly random due to Blizzard doing everything to hide their playernumbers, and its also blizzards fault for offering early realm transfers where people who felt at a disadvantage left and made imbalance worse.
---
No, the imbalances were not done on purpose.
---
Looking as census data it seemed that people who picked PvP servers were more likely to roll Horde, while people who picked PvE servers were more likely to roll Alliance.
---
There was no mads conspiracy here. I think the imbalance was inevitable.
---
I kept my enchanted gold bloodrobe until I crafted my robe of the Void. Admittedly a little longer than I should've went, but I just didn't come across anything to replace it.

In my previous guild the first two kills were post submerge, that's with sone fresh 60s and a handful of pugs. Pretty much all guilds should be able to kill him in time after they get their act together.
---
no just get 2 "3 minute mages" and EFC gets oneshottet.
---
&gt; And thats the point.
---
But what difference does it actually make? Who's actually looking at Feralas scenery when riding from Feathermoon Stronghold to Dire Maul for the 32nd tribute run?
---
&gt; Are you unable to read? I told it's because people are busy rep/honor grinding because BGs are only just released.
---
Except it's not. Heaps of private servers, on top of Vanilla WoW all have presented the same thing.
---
It's always been like this.
---
No honor, no pvp save the sporadical ganking here and there.
---
Honor gets in, massive brawlfest all around with deathballs roaming entire zones.
---
BGs get added: everyone gets in there and the world reverts to pre-honor status. Everybody minding their own business with some sporadical ganking here and there.
---
Flying mounts do not really add anything to this. Getting away gets easier, but getting the surprise attack is also easier.
---
He could have just followed his plan without saying anything, which I think is the more asshole part.
---
We are talking about a fictional "classic+" here
---
Imagine wasting your time on Reddit explaining to people with lives to take a video game that they play for fun more seriously.
---
If you have 9% hit and assume you always use specials and heroic strike, will you have glancing blows?
---
”This is Deadmines! Faster tank nobody is dying here.” Pulls with the healer being half mana. Hunter’s pet pulls an additional pack. ”I’m zoom.” We all die.
---
I'd been completely out of the game for 12 years. I didn't even realize there had been private servers. When Vanilla launched, at least on Sargeras, Horde was the underdog. I expected the same.
---
The fun is that he thinks that anyone gives a shit about ban lists from crossover realm, you must be really underperforming in your real life to even think that anyone gives shit, if they did, they wouldnt be in pug themselves
---
Yeah I mostly just asked out of curiosity to see how geared I should be going in. I'm currently raiding MC and Ony every week but have had pretty bad luck with Druid gear. Only seen one piece of T2 and lost the roll and only seen a few pieces of T1. Also still missing a lot of the other healing BiS pieces like Aurastone, Cauterizing band, Salamanders.
---
I am in pretty much a full preBiS / BiS mix though, since a lot of dungeon blues are better than the current raid gear.
---
Think I only have the wild growth spaulders, T1 legs, and shard of the scale so far from raiding. Hopefully I'll get the T2 pieces before BWL comes out.
---
   If your problem is solely maintaining threat and it surviving, then you don’t need the shield. Use two hand or DW doesn’t matter a ton but know that generally two handed weapons are better against multiple mobs because it helps with WW, where as DW is generally stronger against single targets. 
---
   I foolishly leveled as prot being my first time but all I really did in dungeons was seeker rage, charge, swap to D stance, and blood raged. After that I would drop 2-3 sunders on the first target I wanted dead (marked with a skull for the DPS to focus) and then tabbed through all adds around me spamming sunders and revenges when available. Most of my threat problems were due to rage generation but once I optimized that, threat management went fine. 
---
   You have to remember that threat management is not entirely on you. If all dps are blowing their load on different targets there’s no way you will be able to hold threat on every single mob. So if you find that happening make sure you mark the kill order you want after that, it’s on them. 
---
   Also, if you have casters in your group, you can usually check your healers mana and once the DPS mana is getting close to full, go ahead and run in and start building threat while they finish drinking and the healer keeps you alive.
---
The cool thing about rank 13-14 is that only a few are crazy enough to get it. Ofc its more a representation of no-life than skill and a shit system compared to 'ranked rating', but it would be weird to change it now and see everyone wear the 'ungettable' rank 14 stuff
---
"It was at that moment he realized he fucked up."
---
Same, vanilla horde is not the same as it is today, it seems all the spergs migrated to us because our pvp racials are better, none of them knows what horde was actually like, how helpful people were, hours spent training new players molding players into elite raiders and pvpers, having duels that lasted 6 hours with the same enemy but allowing to get full hp and mana before initiating. Those days were fun. Not the brainless zergs with sapper charges now, or the camping and not having a fair fight that we see now. Respect the 1v1. If I notice anyone camping and not allowing to get full/hearth I automatically assume you are bad at the game and have been proven wrong yet.
---
&gt; if someone is flying near you and you want to gank them then just use a net-o-matic
---
Bigger issue is that it's way too easy for people to get to you when you start fighting, so it's rare to be able to actually gank someone in any kind of active zone
---
Or if you're massively outnumbered by the opposing faction in general, small skirmishes turn into 5v10 shitshows in a hurry rather than being able to catch a couple of people unaware
---
Or druids just fucking off during any fight ever
---
Sometimes you make a mistake. I recently bought a Star Ruby for 50 gold by mistake.
---
Warlocks get the least benefit from spirit.
---
&gt; Formulas for mana regeneration based on spirit:
---
    Priests and mages: 13 + (spirit / 4) mana per tick
---
    Druids, shamans, paladins, hunters: 15 + (spirit / 5) mana per tick
---
    Warlocks: 8 + (spirit / 4) mana per tick 
---
At lvl 46 the best route to go as a Warlock is draintanking, almost no downtime, which values stamina. Great guide [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ccxosl/dives_drain_tanking_guide_for_warlock_leveling_in/)
---
As a warlock I can't recommend it enough, it's efficient but also fun imo. It made leveling much more enjoyable.
---
Pretty much just based on horde having superior pvp racials. It was evened out a few xpacs later with humans getting double trink

Warlocks get instant heals once every 2 minutes.  Sadly druids have to wait three minutes for their instant heals :(

Be careful when clicking that promote all button in the future!!! Also do not let any members step into MC before the raid leader does. Note to self

Alliance gives up to easily.   Was a problem in vannila too.

All the more reason to ignore this league imo. Arbitrary ass rules and you still see how dominant Warlocks are.

**&lt;Fellowship of Friendship&gt; Late-night, Casual Raiding Guild**
---
**Incendius**
---
**Times:** Tues/Wed 10pm-1am Server Time
---
**Progress:** 9/10 MC, 1/1 Ony
---
**Loot:** Coming soon pending a vote by members.
---
**Discord:** https://discord.gg/8rzbxRu
---
**About Us:**
---
What you'll find at FoF is a smaller, more personal group of players that truly enjoy playing the game together. We are looking to facilitate that culture with new members that want to come in, shoot the shit with us, down some bosses, and make sure everyone still has plenty of time for their real life responsibilities.
---
We began hosting MC Pugs 2 weeks ago and have progressed to 9/10 with Rag down to 10%. Each raid we have filled with more guildies and had to pug less. We are looking to take that next step into full guild runs and need a few more members to round out our team.
---
We are happy to take members who have never experienced raiding in vanilla, or on private servers, or even in WoW at all. Our officers have done the content, they know the game. We'll be here to help guide you through the content.
---
**Needs:**
---
We are currently looking for 2-3 Hunters, a few Melee DPS, and 1 more healer of any class.
---
Any class/spec that feels like they would fit our culture/team is encouraged to reach out even if not specifically called out by our needs above.
---
**Contact:**
---
For more info feel free to stop by our discord or DM me (pwlocke#7260). You can also look in-game for Bahnzo, Gallar, Freshprintz, ArtGarfunkel, or Daeranor.
---
You've been answered, my response is superfluous, but I feel like saying something anyway.
---
Definitely imp wands, it's insane, I personally would run spirit tap too, but you can absolutely run down any tree from there and be fine until about 40ish. I generally level my priests disc/holy, because I really just don't care for shadow. The difference is being able to go without drinking longer in dungeons while healing. Any spec will heal fine, it's just a matter of mana consumption and management. Good luck!
---
You know, before I hit my 30's &amp; got a fiancee with 3 cats I would do this all the time. These days I am usually off by midnight. Every so often we'll game til 2 AM together, but not often.
---
1) Yes they absolutely did.
---
2) I'm not focusing on wPvP. I'm saying that the world outside capital cities and bgs is empty right now. It's been empty since people ran out of stuff to do in it.
---
You are just not backing up your statement that being able to fly makes the world somehow less immersive. Repetition makes the world less immersive. First times you see something it's impressive and awesome, after a while you just hope for it be as quick as possible.
---
Then I ask a "WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?" And you reply with
---
&gt; It's not the main thing but yes... Among other things. I really don't see how this is such a hard concept to grasp lol.
---
Yes it's not an answer to that question.
---
At this point I'm going to assume you're a troll.
---
Hinterlands.
---
So am I, but it may scuff deathwish timing if fights slow.
---
KEK!
---
Day 1 maybe, now Horde is favored. Horde adjusted and cares more about winning since they have such a long queue on average. Alliance is satisfied with whatever they get since they pop almost immediately.
---
All these ppl critiquing the way youre playing as if itll prevent getting instakilled right from spawn by 5 players all at once hahahaha. Oh man. Thats hilarious. You know there really is way more players than there was in actual vanilla, sucks that a lot of em seem to be douchebags.
---
&gt; After TBC each new server had AQ already open. 
---
This was after WOTLK, I believe patch 3.03. The gates were definitely closed for Ravenholdt (RP-PVP) which opened post-TBC.
---
Prestige World Wide definitely has the most assholes / griefers / children of any guild on the server.
---
Alliance have the larger population on some servers, and horde outnumber alliance for Classic overall.
---
Battlegrounds are totally cross-realm; people from PVE, PVP, and RP servers all get thrown into AV and WSG together. But horde have much higher queue time for all battlegrounds -- even AV with its PVE rings and offhands. It's the best indication that horde significantly outnumber alliance overall.
---
It's alright, I'll make you a portal to Theramore so you can go hide.
---
what a tool
---
Were you trying to buy a Ruby though?
---
The issue is how do you accidentally buy a pearl when trying to buy an orb?
---
Besides, we had raid logs that can be posted after the raid.
---
If you have things that are running then letting them get far away enough such that you are not going to get hit by the other things your presumingly still tanking is pretty risky.  If you have things that are casters that are far away that you did not LOS...learn to LOS.
---
If the healer is geared they should not be risking going OOM on trash then something has gone very wrong and again shifting out of bear is pretty much a last ditch move to try and save a wipe.  I've pulled it off a few times but to ignore the danger is silly.  Acting as glib as being able to setup a scenario where your healer is in need of an Innervate and you conveniently have mobs far enough away to FC to such that you can get off your Innervate GCD and then shift back into bear w/o losing a ton of health and or dying in the process.
---
By far most of the time my Innervate is much better spent during trash keeping the run moving.  My druid is quite geared and I have been playing since vanilla so I know the runs rather well.  Might be a lack of experience on your part such that you find yourself needing to resort to mid-pull Innervates often.
---
&gt; Not at all how that one works (the exploit of the pic shown). Any Horde smart enough to know what they're doing would NOT use that exploit to go anywhere but South bunker if they don't have a capable group.
---
oh snap! I guess the ally defending here know i'm going for the south bunker therefor won't be bothering me! hence, there's no fighting amongst npc and archer!
---
C'mon dude, stop embarassing yourself.
---
There are more patterns than nightfall you should be farming for. Corehound belt on a leatherworker, for example, is huge for druids/shamans/paladins.
---
Decide now what consumables you expect, so people have time to farm. Telling people the night before you need them flasked or gkick for example is unreasonable considering costs.
---
&gt; Getting stats from your offhand is a priority, because they affect your mainhand twice
---
wat?  That seems like an incredibly awkward way to word OH stats affecting MH damage.  It makes it sound like it applies twice.
---
Yes, it does. But we had 4 resto shams, 5 priests and 2 druids, and with that many healers it’s actually more efficient to take the coefficient loss and actually be able to not over heal. My Rank 2 was doing around 1200. My Rank 1 Does 900. They have almost the exact same MP/H ratio while having that many healers by the time someone dropped 1200 hp someone was casting a flash. So by going to rank 1, I was able to heavily mitigate overhealing and saw more value in my heal (:
---
Less than 170, I was able to fish at 170 but it’s difficult to catch them. I presume 150 would be minimum.
---
Thanks. I just didn’t get why people don’t wanna talk in retail. It’s weird. It’s just silent and..shit I might as well be playing a one player game or destiny 2
---
ACTUALLY it reminds me of playing the old .HACK://Sign series games on ps2 that was a single player game but simulated a MMO, all the way down to the desktop and game launcher for story intermissions.
---
Really great series of games if you can play them..but super ultra rare and expensive. I wish they would remake them. (One of the best features was beating the game and using ur save files in the sequels...and they were hard. You kinda had to do it that way)
---
Which one them lul xD
---
Imp wand/spirit tap. Then Lawl all the way to 60. :)
---
Yeswhen mixed with t3 the t0.5 4 piece is bis for rogues
---
Hey I was in this game! I'm the priest all the way on the right. 
---
Anyway, contrary to what this looks like, this match was actually SUPER FUN. There were eventually 2-3 horde who kept the peace and fished with the rest of the crew, but there were also some troublemakers on both sides. An alliance mage kept trying to kill our orc bro over here so I had to keep MCing him so that he wouldn't die. Some mages also helped sheep him so regen hp. We also had a couple horde casters come and try to gank a few of us, but again, fishing crew protects our own. 
---
Overall actually some of the best time I've had in the game so far.
---
Loads of people prefer vanilla over Wrath.
---
we already have armor and magic resist
---
Thing is resilience is a stat that just stacks in top of other defensive stats it's messy
---
Btw you over estimate how dps increases, the dps difference between pre raid bis and Naxx gear is like 2x it's not that much, it's even less than defense if you consider stamina x armor.
---
I like the think of it as the Alliance decided they was going to roleplay as the Elves from LOTR and bail.. I mean sail away from the mess in middle Azeroth
---
As many people have said, its the racials on horde side. They're just better for pvp and pve. Alliance does have better aesthetics, thats about it..
---
Why dont horde just use the backdoor?
---
I’m at a cross roads on whether to choose a rogue or warrior (I have a priest main almost 60)
---
I don’t care to tank and I want to DPS. Pvp is my main enjoyment and will only be raiding to get gear to be better in PvP both BG and wPvP. I don’t mind grinding for gear but I don’t want to have to rely on a healer all the time just to be good. I like being able to be bursty. Getting to 60 won’t be an issue.
---
Help me choose!
---
that shit will get snipe by other, even-douchier, horde players and sold back to them at 500% markup
---
I did this on a run with a dual wield tank who had shit threat output and awareness, it was still a horrible run to heal.
---
Free transfers, cancel that shit we messed up.  
---
Paid tranfers, ££$$ lets keep those shareholders happy!
---
couldnt even sell marksman bands for vender price on my server lol
---
These things have definitely got me wondering how they'd supply larger servers vs the old days. If everything has the same spawn rates yet we're playing with 3 to 5 times the amount of players, there's going to be a huge shortage in mats for everything. The economy just wouldn't be sustainable. I wonder what they're doing to account for this.
---
I'm a 56 priest, I have been specced as shadow. I will likely still get most of the way to 60 doing quests, but obviously want to start running the higher level dungeons periodically and I will finally need to spec healer to do those properly. If I switch to a standard healing spec, will leveling still be functional? I am mainly concerned about loss of shadowform.
---
Yeah can't find it myself. I tried the retail one and it loads but doesn't have the names like that. And also doesn't let you enter the battlegrounds (Enter Battle button or minimap button).
---
I tamed Sin'Dall in Stranglethorn. Sehr now goes by Sindaljenner
---
Alliance Warlocks disadvantaged in a straight 1v1 vs Undead. However, ultimately in any sort of group PvP Alliance Warlocks are incredible because the synergy they have with Paladins turns them into gods. With a good supporting Holy Paladin, Locks become unstoppable. Freedom, BoP, cleanse, HoJing the kill target, infinite heals/infinite mana, etc. A paladin brings all the support a Warlock needs to make up for all of their weaknesses. For this reason I'd argue Alliance Warlocks are far superior to Horde Warlocks in any serious group pvp.
---
Says the guy defending someone whining  “hur dur pvp Muh corpse run”. 
---
Maybe you should “change the fuckin record jackass”.
---
It is worse, but you are perfectly able to kill creeps as holy. I lvled to 60 in holy spec entire time.
---
i really dont get "report afks" as soon as the door opens...
---
No, it means you don’t have to play the cookie cutter character build that all the tryhards claim is “best.” As long as you’re 90% of the way there the boss still hits the ground.
---
I made a nelf hunter because I’m tired of 30 min av queues. My cats name is ishnu.
---
Which is still sorta a punishment. Sure they can get it done, but they have to jump through a bunch more hoops to do the same thing other servers won't have to worry about.
---
I just collect mounts and pets and help the secret finder guild test glitches and theories and find shit. I was in the last few big groups for finding hive mind, dark unicorn thing and belt of time wasting bullshit.
---
I’ve played for 15 years. I ask myself daily why I still play...all while arguing with myself about playing some switch games and streaming games I really wanna play like Okami, dragon quest, Pokémon, luigis mansion...I mean shit I’ve bought all new games for switch that’s recently been released with intent to play, enjoy, stream and just relive old memories...
---
...but wow is a tough addiction to break. I gotta level my lock, druid, mage...like...ugh.
---
All the chode aside .. man it takes like 17min for an AV to pop on my server. Back in the day ai had time to wait 30+ min for a pop but not now :/
---
As a healer I'm just gonna say - sometimes when the tank dies, it's the tank's fault.
---
Knight maybe? Im guessing
---
Youcan disable titles in interface options
---
could be a 12 yr old trying to act cool. id just ignore and move on
---
What you make it work with whatever game you are sent to?  It’s almost like Alliance premades don’t even need to screw over pugs by not joining games.
---
For those unaware many AV games Alliance starts with 20 or less because premades don’t accept the invite.
---
I care when it affects the success of the raid.
---
I tell people to spec what they want and declare a raid spec from a set of the viable raid specs. We treat them as if they are that spec even if they aren't, and they get gear according to that raid spec.
---
nope its 100% horde. horde players are honestly bad at pvp and needed crutch racials abilities like a free fear break, free stun, free dps boost so they rolled on the zerg faction so they would always have the numbers advantage. now that bgs are horde horde has been exposed for the awful players they are and theyre constantly crying to blizzard to ban premades
---
For a combat dagger rogue in the offhand, would you use a core hound tooth or felstriker? Most online resources say CHT but I've been told by some to stick with FS until T2 and think the online resources may be influenced by how difficult FS is to loot. Just wondering if CHT is worth a roll/bid if I already have FS?
---
I can smell him from here
---
The extra 5 skill points in swords or maces for humans essentially acts as +3% hit when using those weapon types. Yellow hit cap is 9% but reduced to 6% for you since you're a human using swords.
---
Possibly, I'm not exactly sure how Reddit mod works. If a mod can normally do that, then the bot could.
---
Some people take this black lotus thing way too seriously.
---
I’ve been farming for my epic mount down in Silithis this weekend at a known spawn point for these. 
---
I have had the good fortune of having 3 spawn while I have been there and after immediately harvesting the herb I get instantly whispered by a gnome mage claiming I’m botting and what not.
---
Turns out he has ten level one night elves down there dead at every spawn point and no doubt in the other zones where it grows.
---
The last occasion I heard from him I was ganked by a horde ele shaman around the time it was due to spawn. He then whispered me a couple of minutes later saying “oof”...
---
That’s at least 12 accounts that this guy has dedicated to this...dude needs a girlfriend or something.
---
This buy would I
---
So I started casting mind control
---
All you have to do is win the counter in the field of strife. If your idiot raid members would move together and not get picked, get past Galv and get to horde base it's GG in 7 minutes. I truly do not understand why alliance doesn't get that.
---
what if he is acting this way because he is alone? UwU
---
None of the items are worth anything really. Just for teh lulz
---
This isnt a Warlock problem but rather a bad Paladin problem. You haven't been playing with good Paladins so you dont understand how utterly broken the Paladin/Warlock combo is in Vanilla. I understand most Paladin players in pugs are trash, but that's always been the case. Find and group with non-braindead Paladins and every single one of your weaknesses will be compensated for and you will turn into an unstoppable demigod.
---
If you look around I bet there’s one gator named Jim Jones.
---
Gave it a few tries with the new build. While it is much, much MUCH faster. The risks of dying also increase a lot. Maybe I need to practice more since it takes more of a skill to pull it off. But it's not worth the speed gain.
---
For situations like this, I like the term Robin-Hooding
---
Is wow pro integrated an as addon?
---
20K HK’s
---
Save some pussy for the rest of us, jeeze...
---
Felstriker certainly has the cool factor, and it's not bad.  Sometimes that's what is important.
---
Computer Hardware and Racism aren't exactly the same thing are they?
---
Whilst you can form an opinion without experiencing something it would be considered the opposite of an informed opinion. 
---
Especially with how common at least two monitors are both in offices and for personal use, it would probably hint there is some sort of considerable benefit would it not?
---
It should not be surprising when you make a point then basically say "I have nothing to base this on why are people getting annoyed with me?"
---
Says the shitter playing majority faction. Very big boy you are.
---
I bind Z X C for Battle, Defensive and Berserker Stance. I move with WERD instead of QWES or WASD. WERD is great because it frees up QAS and FTYGH easily for keybinds.
---
For longer cooldowns I use Shift + 1, 2, 3, 4
---
Will confirm also
---
If "95% of the time" Paladins arent there to give you support, you are doing it wrong as an Alliance Warlock. If you are running BGs without Paladin healers you are severely gimping yourself. You will have zero problems with Undead players if you have a skilled Paladin supporting you. They make up for every single one of your weaknesses.
---
If you are pugging or choosing to group with awful Paladins for your premades then that's a problem you need to fix ASAP. This is WoW, you cant just yolo it and go solo, you need skilled team support.
---
Insert OPs ball handling skills below
---
Eh, ranking as a concept ruins pvp for me. By the time I get to use the gear improvements from PvP, all the fun would have been sucked out from battlegrounds already. 
---
And raid gear for most classes has a good counterpart to PvP gear anyway. The difference isn't worth breaking your back over.
---
Fight Club is a great resource, here is there list which has weapons specific to race. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/2/d/1YXJpasqqodeq9B4jeUZDP9khFQf5QocyMby6moydJWk/htmlview?usp=sharing&amp;sle=true#

Feel free to attack - as long as she doesn't die you'll be able to complete the quest.
---
T.5 was never meant to be a pre raid set or anything like that. As you said it came out way too damn late in wow's life. Obviously just something to give the casuals something to do.
---
Well, i do. Now.
---
I think that Shamans would be much, much higher if it was an EU tournament. Shaman ENH/ Hand of Rag is a massive meme and one that us NA players swallow hard. Ele. is by far the better and more consistent PvP spec.
---
I'm a SCATMAN!!! *denied*
---
The raid groups takes the ID of whoever *started* the group, regardless of who you pass leader to or who walks in the instance first. Make sure you always start a fresh group with a character that is going to raid.
---
I have both. Cht is definitely a dps increase in pve. Felstriker is an amazing OH for pvp though.
---
Can you name one piece of tanking gear that drops out of Strat Live? 
---
Unless you think you run dungeons for fun?
---
Yea people won't care about these as much as OP thinks
---
So can you just spam Slam without worrying about your swing timer?
---
100g+/hour ? With a friend teleporting you out 4 times an hour and great RNG maybe, and a very healthy potion price economy at that (never saw Mana pots going for more than 3G on raid nights on my serv, while Healing pots are over twice cheaper). It's all easy until you get your FD resisted on Trash and bugged Doomguards aggroing you through the walls while taking their mob pack with them. There's so much unfixed shit in there it's hard to talk about easyness ; more about randomness. 
---
Runs are trivial in terms of skill, that's sure. Mara princess sure is "harder" and requires more focus than King Gordok in Classic. That being said, due to RNG, you can do several perfect runs in under an hour and then wipe for the next hour without even getting to the last boss due to unfortunate scenarios playing out and long corpse runs. I already happened to have like 4 perfect runs in a row just to wipe repeatedely on the fifth on trash.
---
Either way it's boring as hell (like most of the other gold grinds though).
---
Because they are running down mid without realizing that there is only 20 ish alliance in the game when the door is opened. The rest haven't connected yet and when they run and die they assume that the huge bunch that is still running down south were "AFK" as oppose to not getting the queue pop earlier.
---
Tons of ALTs, im on my 4th on medium pop server and there's almost always a group. Even elite quests a +1 is always around.
---
Just play NA.
---
The future of classic wow is less certain than retail.
---
Ok, noted. Will definitely not be getting rid of FS regardless, as I assumed it's more valuable in pvp with the burst capability. Obviously the dps increase in pve was noticeable for you so that's a check in the CHT column. Thanks
---
You stretched so far to have a reason to say the same shit everyone else does. Its like you guys get some wierd nerd superiority validation boner for like “yeah sorry youre not good enough at the game to cut it over here with the rest of us pvp lords.”
---
When really those of you that are successful on pvp servers arent actually good at the game, you just take advantage of any combination of the VARIETY of ways to not pvp fairly. Youre either in a group, killing lowbies, camping fps, etc, then when someone calls you out its the same regurgitation of the same dumb “git gud” “go to pve” rhetoric that you think somehow justifies it and validates your false misconception that you are good and they arent. 
---
Its all an unfunny joke honestly, but i guess if thats what makes you feel good about yourself then have at it.
---
are you trying to measure dicks over who sleeps the least?
---
The margins are greater though... you can profit more as an enchanter if you provide the materials.  You gotta have money to make money haha
---
Yea you'll get stuck. You need to finish the quest unless something has changed.
---
And in Vanilla, as well as on every Pserver there is a community accepted form of dueling. The community writes the rules and they develop and change over time. If people don't like the rules they are more than welcome to not enter the tourny to try and win $50,000. Without rules there is no point in some classes showing up, and they wouldn't. Go back to PvE.
---
It is. I've been in plenty of games where alliance isn't putting up a fight but horde will refuse to go farther north than Bal. They'll just circle around mid field killing the people that trickle down.
---
My love of kalimdor disagrees with your last sentence
---
i'm more talking about mass-AoE tanking, such as 10x weak non-elites for example. the best you can do without bombs in that case is spam battle/demoralizing shout or gather up a thorns set.
---
for normal multi-packs with 3-4 mobs you'll be fine with tab-spamming sunder, engineering won't really be needed for those. the biggest notable difference between vanilla tanks and tbc tanks in this regard is you don't have thunder clap in your arsenal as a good threat-generator, in vanilla it cannot be used in defensive stance + does not generate any extra threat + its damage is cut by more than half.
---
TBC got a lot of things right that could be brought over to classic+ and wouldn't mess with the spirit of classic WoW too much. The idea would be to not raise the level cap and invalidate the progress and time people have already put in to their characters. Here are some examples:
---
1: Arenas with a similar reward structure to what it was in TBC. 
---
The classic honor system was one of the most reviled parts of classic and it's pretty shocking that it was brought back without any modifications. Arena PvP allowed people who were skilled but didn't have months to dedicate fully to WoW nonstop to get solid gear and participate in meaningful and satisfying PvP. Arena gear should be basically BIS for PvP and heavily weighted to favour survivability. Resilience could be brought back in a tuned form to try and make burst focused specs viable since burst dmg is a huge and memorable part of vanilla (everyone remembers those big crit ele shaman montages).
---
2. Honor system rework.
---
The honor system is even worse this time around since it requires you to grind AV which is... not amazing. Anecdotally, it is also seems like it is much harder for players to reach middle tier ranks without putting in huge amounts of time at the AV honor factory. The issues that people brought up with the system even back in Vanilla (which made Blizz change it eventually near TBC release) are still very present. Namely, the honor system has absolutely nothing to do with actual skill in PvP and instead rewards people for playing a literally unhealthy amount of time. The introduction of rated bgs would be a good way to change this and give an incentive for premade vs premade action instead of incentivizing pubstomping and queue dodging which is not fun for anyone. There should also be a way for groups to queue directly vs specific other groups (no rewards) to help set up matches to be streamed and spectated. 
---
Moving on, the reward system for honor could be revamped to be more similar to what it was towards the end of vanilla with honor being points you purchase gear with. However, to make sure that rank 13-14 tier gear remains difficult to achieve, it should be locked behind a rated bg requirement. BWL tier items and sets for each class could be buyable with honor and no rating requirement but take a significant amount of time to get. This would allow people to work towards something at their pace and help to prevent the honor grind from completely sucking the fun out of PvP. The current honor titles would be tied to bg rating. Seeing someone with a grand Marshall or high warlord title should make you instantly know the person knows what they're doing and is a fearsome BG battle tactician instead of someone who simply played an unhealthy amount of AV.
---
3. Meaningful profession rewards.
---
Several professions in classic are missing rewards that would motivate people to invest and keep them around instead of eventually dropping them for engineering. Adding BOP profession locked recipes that directly affect your character beyond providing pieces of gear would help to make professions more interesting. TBC had the right idea with things like ring enchants or powerful bop armor kits. There are a lot of fun things that could be added like this. To prevent people from dropping profs once they get these items, the bonuses should require a certain profession skill level to still be on the character for the effects to work.
---
4.  Creating a living world/ heroic 5mans
---
Activity in most non end games zones has dramatically dropped off now that a very large portion of the player base has hit max level. This is unfortunate because a lot of the leveling zones are cool and it was great seeing tons of people run around and breathe life into them in the first month of classic. To help recapture a bit of that energy, heroic versions of classic leveling dungeons should be implemented. These would be locked behind attunement quests chains that would being LVL cap players back to these zones and make them run around to unlock the heroic versions of these dungeons.  The heroic versions of these dungeons should be quite challenging and require players to actually use their class abilities instead of just steamrolling dungeons and completely ignore mechanics like in the current 5man meta. Rewards for these dungeons could be similar to 20man raid gear.  
---
4. Naxx gear stays the highest ilvl possible.
---
Naxx gear is already ludicrously strong. There should not be any gear added that is stronger in raw stats than Naxx gear. Parallel raids with similar difficulty and ilvl gear could certainly be added but the focus should be on exploring different types of itemization instead of just more raw stats. One of the charming aspects of vanilla itemization wasn't really straightforward initially. There is a lot that could be built on there without going with the straightforward and boring route of just putting more raw stats on items.
---
5. Class balance pass.
---
It's no secret that several specs are not in a great place in classic. Ret/prot Paladins, balance druids, feral druids to a lesser extent, enhancement shamans, etc. Most classes have some talents that are completely useless and badly designed (imp shield block after 1 pt and lightwell come to mind). There could be some nuanced changes made to these talents to make bad specs more viable or atleast give them a niche they could fill. Lots of room for creativity here.
---
Corehound Tooth hands down.
---
The crit rate of a raid geared/combat spec rogue is already 30%+ on white hits  and 60%+ on backstab. Getting a proc for 3 crits is not going to be very impactful.
---
The stats on the CHT are superior to me.
---
Then why do horde vastly outnumber alliance in retail as well, assuming racials no longer matter?
---
You can catch them anytime but the catch rate outside the 12-6pm window is low enough that you likely won’t hit 20-30g/hr
---
I can tell you a few things about Shadowpanther to help you make a decision. 
---
1.  Shadowpanther only looks at stats, not difficulty to acquire an item.
---
* SP weights the green text on Felstriker at the equivalent of a flat 3% crit buff. It's up to you to decide if that's accurately weighted.
---
* CHT outweighs Felstriker by 24 MAEP, meaning that you'd need an additional:
---
a) 2.4% crit or b) 48 attack power or c) 24 DPS on felstriker to make it comparable to CHT. 
---
I'm a theorycrafting nerd and have engulfed myself with the SP spreadsheets. Hope this helps.
---
It's says it's a screenshot but... *spoilers* : it's not.

Please send me a message if your recruitment needs match up with what I can bring to the table.  Thanks!
---
how were you not in combat when you poly? Thought you can't loot those things while in combat?
---
Was your reflect on CD? Wear more pvp gear I guess.
---
Yup
---
Carebear servers? 
---
LUL

Horde west coast PVP server.  Rogue looking for a new home.  Hoping to find a late night weekend raiding guild.  I normally roll around as a casual cause I can never commit to the usual raid times guilds try.  I am currently still farming my pre bis.  Hoping to raid around 10 or 11 PST.  I am leveling up a priest also that will be a end game healer that also needs a home (level 40).  Happy to transfer to any server that would have a home for me.
---
Ele shamans are top tier for pvp and really good contenders in duels. Enhance shaman are hot garbage, even with hand of rag. Esp when you have no idea how to duel (ie titanfrost)
---
Idk who let that guy in the tourney, but watching him play makes me think they just picked him up 10 mins before it started. Brought down the wind really hard.
---
I agree with the advice to camp that mountain with Eagle Eye, but it's also helpful to get the unitscan addon and add Broken Tooth to your scan list. Makes it impossible to miss him. Also helpful tip, he respawns 6-8 hours after death. I found him one weekend with unitscan only to ride up and see he was dead. But I just came back 6 hours later, started up the process again, and 2 hours after that I had my new pet.
---
I didn't save the pets to sell, but did save the frost potion recipe.
---
You can't enter at all with the pug. When you try to zone in, you get an error message stating something like, "You are already saved to another instance of this raid" and don't even get the losing screen.
---
So you're normal, i get downvoted because people cant grasp that you cant go raid with 5 pal ret, 4 sp, more feral than rogue. 
---
Sure it might work right now because some people in the raid are pulling more weight for them and mc is ez, but ofc everyone on reddit does it in 1h with meme spec (why do i still see lfg mc 5/10 in the world chat i wonder)
---
Is there anything unique about getting the skill-up from 299 to 300? I play a troll mage and during the AV queues I've been grinding weapon skill (please don't judge me.) But after getting daggers up to 299 stabbing ogres and snatching up wintersbite the last weapon skill up still hasn't popped after dozens of ogres, far, far more than the others even from 295-299.
---
Pretty sure horde on a lot of those servers will just move items across using the neutral ah and complete it that way.
---
With, obviously.
---
I mean its equally as bad... deathbringer is a phenomenal weapon. At least horde side, if it drops you're now a dual wield warrior :^)
---
As a gnome fury warrior, am I better off using OEB in raids than dual-wielding if I don't have Edgemaster's?
---
My gf won't let me
---
I dont think he needs your financial advice
---
Whats with this trend of people starting their sentences with 'i mean'? Do you normally not mean what you say?
---
You can save yourself a few keybindings by binding overpower, revenge and whirlwind to the same key on your stance bar since each one is only used in a certain stance. You can also make a macro that will hamstring or charge. You can only do one or the other based on range, so you can spam it, and it will do whichever is appropriate.
---
You said pve content isn't 'legitimately challenging' in any game. I think that has a lot to do with what I replied.
---
Hit over 6% reduces the damage reduction from glancing blows up to 95%
---
Oh do The Alliance literally get intsa que always?
---
Nothing new here just don't bother with classic...it sucks
---
6% is enough for yellow hits, but you should ideally stack more for white hits which provides the majority of your dps. Also later on in the game, your crit chance can get limited with your hit rate. Google around to check some numbers.
---
Because back in the day, 40 players on one server was a lot. Before cross realm, you couldn't play AV 24/7
---
My holiday sleep schedule literally makes it so I haven't seen daylight since the 20th. Send help.
---
You're downvoted because you're coming across as a pretentious prick
---
Exactly.
---
The set will be nothing more (well, maybe rogues will go out of their way for the 4 piece bonus as an exception) than an extra something to do.
---
If you look at the druid, shaman or even say priest set -- they are so generalized and all over the place the set is only useful for collecting the odd one off piece of the set until it can get replaced by (what would be if released at phase 5) AQ 20/40, BWL or ZG gear.  And these players will still need to fork up the close to 500g in mats and time to collect D1 -- then the actual D2 chain/quests itself.
---
Its just not worth it for the min-maxer PVE raider to even really consider getting unless they are actually bored and collect class sets.
---
The answer is always post. Unless you mean somethings that happened in TBC and later. The C'thun fixes/nerfs that made him theoretically killable came in before the pre-tbc patch, so these should be in from the moment AQ is opened.
---
Im talking about back in wlk when the racial first happened and the entire competitive pvp scene shifted from blackrock horde to tichondrius alliance. A lot of the rest of the pvp playerbase followed suit. 
---
The racial has since been nerfed and im not sure what happened to the population numbers since then.
---
Cringe
---
You forgetting about berserker rage?
---
Level 5 bank alt with enchanting. Free money!
---
Only use it if healers are struggling and to proc revenge, it’s a tps loss to just spam it on CD.
---
Oh yeah I know, check my first dumbass response
---
I don't remember it being like this when I played in 1.12 back in the day. What changed?
---
If you have to ask for an invite, then you're not invited.
---
Haha i struck a nerve there huh? Sorry youre both unoriginal and a sad whiny little bitch 😂
---
Yes, longest wait was 5 seconds for me. Av that is, wsg takes around 2 minutes.
---
I mean if fights are really slow.
---
Record so far for our group of friends, 2 hour 40minutes.
---
Friend joined at 40minutes and stayed for 2 hours. They won atleast but he said later to me I dont know why I didnt leave the bg!
---
Lessons from thousands of years of history that are, apparently, all completely forgotten as soon as you log into WoW.
---
Yeah we're " bitching about spec and debuff slot" but im the prick ;)
---
Not even mentionning the mental illness thing
---
if 3 players all chain snowball him, they can yeet him straight out of the keep even from tanking him against the back wall.
---
My personal favorite is still snowballing Horde players that cap Snowfall GY off the bridge or Icewing bunker cliff.
---
Yeah uh boss, I think I caught a bug from one of my family members this Christmas. Not gonna be able to make it in to work today.
---
I haven’t had the luck of getting a group into AV so we’ve been playing WSG as you can join as group.. anyone have any good tactics for trying to link up in AV with friends?
---
Better than the constant whine coming out of the pvp servers.
---
In the PvE point of view, I wonder if people roll Alliance warlocks less because, in the story, they are awful people. I have gone to around lvl 30 on both sides warlock (silly friends going back to Retail so I switched to RP realm). Orc warlocks know that they are dealing with something very nasty and have to make sure to not be overrun. This time the demons shall serve. Be reminded of the important things, be honourable.
---
Alliance warlocks are like "woah, look at this powerful thing that no one else can imagine to control, the fools" and it's like they are playing at being the darkest bunch ever. The quest giver for voidwalker and succubus was obsessing over his late apprentice instead of talking about being safe, for example. And then I went and poisoned a person who got suspicious of the bar on top of the warlock trainer's. 
---
Because I don't PvP, the thing that annoys me the most about my human warlock is the class story.
---
Good thing I didn’t ask for an invite then. Just stated I was looking.
---
nah im seeing the same issue between loch modan and badlands, with the troggyboys.
---
mobs that get killed in the server transition zone between two zones, stay dead and bugged
---
This! But my girlfriend came home from her nightshift... ”hey ur up early”
---
"Taste the flames of sulfuron" is the wrath shout. This is what you should use to determine it has gone off. This gives him 2 seconds to use shield slam/bloodthirst and revenge or sunder/heroic strike and SHOULD keep threat through the next 30 seconds. If tank is dropping aggro to someone else first check their rotation, and then if they are doing a proper rotation check their gear. They're probably not hit capped and are losing threat to missed yellow attacks.
---
You know they released BG's so it doesn't matter anymore?
---
In for the raid rage clip too!
---
You know you deserve a kick in the face with an axe when your macro starts with "So, I..."
---
I leveled 0-60 by putting 5 in improved wands, then 5 in spirit tap, then put the rest in discipline and holy.
---
As long as you get the improved wands and spirit tap, you're good.
---
Going shadow is not required for leveling to 60. The grinding mob spell rotation is just holy fire, smite, SWP, wand them til dead while your mana regens. It's very efficient and you don't need shadow talents for it.
---
From my experience he basically instantly gains 30% ish hp, and you have to aggro him back in the keep meaning warmasters, unless if you repeat the pull they did before which will certainty get him to 100% hp
---
Watch a stream with someone running premades and try to get into their game...
---
Yes, but you should use the macro when your cast time &gt; time until next auto. Pressing the macro slightly late makes you miss a few milliseconds of your swing timer. Pressing it slightly early makes you miss an entire white melee swing.
---
Ive been doing a ton of research and a bit of theory crafting on whether or not improved slam is worth it. In my opinion, if you're a robot at playing the game and do everything perfectly it doesn't really help, but in reality it can help in some situations where you mess up the timing on your abilities or have to move around. It can also be useful when you dont have 100 rage all of the time because you dont have world buffs or you're in a dad guild because if you don't use every single global cooldown that isnt slam then improved slam can help.
---
If you plan to run slam the entire raid I would take 4/5 imp slam and skip improved execute in favor of 2h weapon spec. If you like swapping to dual wield for single target fights then I would just run a standard dual wield fury build and use the slam macro once the adds are dead on bosses like luci and gehennas.
---
Its confirmed to be random melee entities now.
---
this but a little different for initial opener. Charge-&gt;1 white hit-&gt;SS-&gt;zerker stance-&gt;bloodrage-&gt;whirlwind-&gt;zerker rage-&gt; D stance-&gt; tab sunders and cleaves if excess rage, slap sword and board on if taking too much damage and as he said go battle stance at end of fight to build rage for next pull.
---
Any gear listed "of the eagle" is int and stam. Theres plentyof gear to level holy with.
---
Love the last comment in raid before the video ends: "LOL at cunts saying recall"
---
Yea I get that - I remember queues being a lot worse back then, but when cross realm came out so long ago it seems like a logical fix that should have been made. 51’s are going to want to do AV for some of the rewards and the XP they can gain. A lvl 60 and 51-59 just have the chance (not guaranteed) to be worlds apart in terms of gear and I think it would make AV better to have a group of pure 60s. 
---
Seems like it was an easy opportunity for Blizz to have fixed a long time ago but as stated it’s too late to do that now.
---
Whatever you say, dude.
---
This didn't age well..Rank 11 and have never done a WSG
---
For mages I’ll add the frost power elixir that came from winters veil. Stacks on top of the greater arcane elixir
---
Tell people in his guild and mention it on the realm's discord server.
---
The cringe salt in the comments on the post on r/FairbanksClassic is amazing by the way, worth a gander.
---
Not sure, never used it. Will check on this when I get home.
---
I haven't won a single AV all day yesterday as Horde. Tell me how Horde is favored.
---
having cats usualy means you can't sleep lol
---
I'm in the thick of the honor grind aiming for rank 10 but I always prefer a 40 min win to a 20 min loss. Because even though I care about honor and ranking, I care more about sending a message. I don't want the horde thinking they can win if they just turtle long enough to make the Alliance /afk because of their precious honor per hour not being good enough.
---
I'm in an AV cross realm discord for coordinating premades and I love stirring my fellow alliance into sticking it to the horde in this manner and recalling just enough to halt their progress on Vann/Marshals if we're losing a race. It's funny how much an impassioned speech can sway minds, but it's almost addicting when people actually listen and we get the desired result. Every turtle I manage to swing a win from like this is way more fun than winning or losing in 12 minutes.
---
I’m loving it! I’ll say though that there’s an obvious difference between top hunter and average hunter performance and that’s only going to get wider as progression continues.
---
Boss level minus 3 will pretty much always result in a good run.   Try not to have your dps or tank facing a red boss.
---
Play alliance then, help correct the faction imbalance which is what causes the different queue times.
---
Sorry, all I can see is “wah let me whine”
---
Try to find zones as far away from the queue locations as possible.
---
I would imagine Winterspring, Un'Goro, and Silithus being the best places to go level right now.
---
Just time and more hits. Next MC just jump into melee and start stabbing the lava surgers
---
Can't you just zone out, reform the group without the person who is saved, and zone back in? It should only save you once you actually kill a boss
---
You are probably right. Its just commonly referred to as "pre 1.7 loot" as thats what the private servers tried to run on for the MC/BWL patches, and then updated it post ZG release
---
&gt;Bugs weren’t the only problem. C’Thun demanded an insane amount of focus and optimization. He stretched the limits of what a well-equipped, well-composed 40-man raid group could accomplish. Today, Ion Hazzikostas is a developer on World of Warcraft, but before that he was the guild leader of Elitist Jerks, and after crunching some numbers, famously concluded that C’Thun was mathematically impossible in his original state.
---
I didn't do the math or come up with the complaint myself, I was taking Ion's word for it.
---
Source: [PC Gamer Article](https://www.pcgamer.com/the-story-of-cthun-how-a-wow-boss-drove-raiders-to-madness/)
---
There's plenty of counterplay.
---
Personally I haven't experienced playing against that many premades. However the people constantly leaving queue has definitely had an effect on queue times. I think that's the real issue
---
Mages gear doesn’t matter if you hit him with that 2h. And most mages panic when you get out of frost nova.
---
Someone made a spreadsheet a week or two ago showing that winning with anaverage game length of 35 mins gave more honor and rep per hpur than losing in 6-12 minutes
---
I mean, I'd be jealous of me too. I got a pretty sweet life.
---
You’re thinking of weapon skill.  And it’s glancing reduction is hard capped at 308 skill
---
 As long as you're still getting plenty of physical activity and nutrition, getting less sleep than recommended doesn't impact your long term health after you return to a normal schedule.
---
Loving these posts today, this and the 54 Hunter with Staff of Dom. Please keep them coming.
---
Why do you have edgemasters as human? Waste man. But sure you can use CHT as edgemaster warrior, it's pretty strong.
---
We do, but people are botting to break it to spite the people in bracket 1.
---
I’ve always leveled as sm/ruin and have never respec. Simply not worth it
---
Death ray
---
Twinking is just about being as strong as possible in that specific pvp bracket.
---
yeah fuck that guy
---
I didn't say there was nothing, there are just very few things.  Yes it is mostly caster stuff, but that's largely because either caster gear was ass, or shit like spell hit was added after launch.
---
It's low level min/maxing
---
Because it's fun.
---
You get to play around at the full potential of any given bracket. And twink vs twink games can be one of the most fun things you can do if you're into PvP.
---
I think it is just for fun. No transferable side benefits with other characters.
---
I have a warrior, I would suggest a rogue if you don't want to tank. Warriors do great dps and tanking but that is exactly it. Rogues have amazing utility, they can pvp incredibly well solo, they can do quests easier than other classes due to the ability to stealth directly to a boss. Same with farming.
---
That might actually work, thank you for the advice &lt;3
---
Oh really? Hmm I'll do some research, didn't know about crit chance limited by hit rate! Thanks
---
It was indeed predicted and horde should’ve known this would happen. Honor is all relative too so not being able to premade doesn’t hurt them since no one else can do it.
---
CDR with server first kill of another guild?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/FairbanksClassic/comments/ehorid/calm_down_rookie_will_try_to_take_credit_for_fury/
---
So much this. I was just telling the dude above ZG is *the* fucking place for warlocks. You get like 8% spell hit once that place opens. 
---
Even AQ20 is great for warlocks. That set ring and dagger are *insane* if you ask me. Clearly good enough to come from 40 mans. I also love Staff of the Ruins.
---
People usualy blame 1.12 itemization but they forget how early most of the changes were
---
95% of the itemiztion changes were done until 1.5.
---
1.10 had a lot of changes but they were new items rather than updating them, and in Classic items that were added later are not available yet. 
---
We've pretty much been playing with 1.5 itemization patch since the start and remember ragnaros world first wasn't until 1.4 and very few guilds were raiding until those patches.
---
Something to work on in between raiding and farming gold without too much of a time commitment, and I find it more fun to do pvp in the 10-19 bracket without tons of CCs and overpowered abilities and epic mounts.
---
You wouldn’t use edge for Deathbringer?
---
I mean I could use flame walker gauntlets with dal rends, but I think DB and edgemaster would be the way to go. Especially if I pick up CHT...
---
Come back when you clear mc within 50 minutes ;).
---
Hey my whole horde guild(cooked) transfered off Stalagg to heartseeker (80+%ally) and it was a blast. 
---
Sure we had 2 bad weeks where there was literally more alliance in org and people camping every fp but now at least the server feels alive and there is a notion of danger.
---
With the longer queues some horde rankers are in epl wpl searing gorge brm etc so the balance isnt too bad.
---
The only downside is the very little pvp brackets and the shitty tiny economy.
---
Hot soup baby

I won a black lotus in Silitus once on my hunter from an dwarf alliance priest who was rushing to get it but was getting attacked by mobs.  I had seen it from a few hundred yards away with eagle eye, so when I finally made it over there she was in the middle of clearing the mobs out.  I ran up to the lotus to try and grab, but she feared me away.  Unfortunately for her it also feared the adds into the rest of the camp and chain aggroed 6-7 more, which after I FDed ALL came in after her.  I picked up the lotus with seconds to spare but ended up dying to the adds that came back in after she ran out of range.  She started camping me after I rezed (I had just hit 60 that same week, so I didn’t have an epic mount or very good gear), but luckily my guildies thought that shit was hilarious and came to my rescue.  Now every time I see someone in that same guild as the priest they /spit at me or try to kill me somehow. 
---
Anyways Sancore, if you’re reading this: WTS black Lotus pst.
---
I keep seeing jackwagons promoting these horde discords.... How many people do you need to queue at once to even get half a match in the same premade? 100?.... And then fuck anyone who didn't get that AV?
---
I had 2 awesome AV games that we managed to turn after wiping the horde on Vanndar, and sending them all the way back to their starting tunnel. Which I found hilarious.
---
However those matches are super rare, as most people can't agree on anything, half ot the raid, or maybe only the most vocal ones want to just lose asap after taking out commanders etc. While a portion are just there to deathmatch, while some want rep.
---
So you get a rotten mix of nothing gets done, and it almost always turns into a 40 min slog without any direction, and nobody gets anything. Not even fun as it often ends up getting corpsecamped on SHGY by horde mages...
---
its awful
---
I would imagine crit and int are more itemized since FoL has such a crappy coefficient, BoL gives a ton of flat healing power, and crits scale with your mana sustain. What's your current crit, mana pool, and +healing? I'd like to math out a real example.
---
This garbage has been debunked countless times. None has ever linked the actual "math" and all he says is:
---
&gt;“Basically, every 60 seconds the encounter requires your raid to do roughly 230,000 damage in order to keep up with the various spawns,”
---
Worst case scenario you have maybe 25 dps in the raid, 5 is in the stomach, that's 20 people doing 230.000 damage in 60 seconds or about 191 dps. Look at some raid logs and you will see people are able to do JUST A TINY FUCKING BIT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED DPS.
---
Where do you draw the line? CC badges gear is good, AD gear is crap, swap them, screw the relation with Naxx? 
---
Same with ZG. Your argument may be good, but it would never please everyone. "Enchants are OP" they may say. 
---
Nochanges is the only idea that makes sense, "this particular change" would never work.
---
Real itemization timelines? Ugh i know id pay for that
---
The hit and AP green trinket is essential. Take this advice and go to Hinterlands

---
Its too easy for alliance to defend.
---
Yeah, I'm gonna have to transfer soon :(
---
The hardcore rankers( theres a lot on stalagg) are gonna go in world during their 25 minute queues. If I was on stalagg I would try to farm ironforge mage trainer area haha
---
my friends and I twinked in vanilla. It was fun to research, develop characters and pvp together. For us, there was a reachable item goal to make our twinks the best. 
---
Whereas, we didn't have time to grind out r13/14 on our mains.
---
This happened to me and the GM's told us that nothing could be done to help us.  Consider yourself lucky.
---
I personally don't get it. You queue up for a BG and then not play in it. Why? Why even go through the honor grind if you don't wanna PVP? What's the god damn point of joining BGs if you're just gonna afk? 
---
I'm having such a hard time understanding why a person would turn on a game and then not play it. If you're not having fun in the game, why even turn it on?
---
Personally i prefer the static crit/ap as opposed to felstriker. Dont know about you but my crit is so high in raids i dont see a huge benefit from FS.
---
Its a useful set for people like me who dont enjoy 40 man content. Id love for the quests to be released sooner, but Ill end up doing them no matter when they come out.
---
Any blue daggers with ACLG will likely be superior to QS+Mirah's for a non-human. QS+Mirah's with Edgemasters would be a remedy here and better than ACLG+bad daggers, but...money. Tough to buy Edgies when you are holding ACLG. It's less about the hit cap and more about the glancing penalty, which is massive when at -15 weapon skill vs a lvl 63 boss.
---
I'd say your two options are to get Edgemasters or switch to daggers, it will be a massive threat increase for you. Bonescraper from UD Strat is a good OH, btw.
---
All that being said, your know your guild and situation best, but my only other comment would be that Fury/Prot OTs are putting too much pressure on their healers and really should be deep prot to be a clutch wipe-saver when needed. You don't really need max TPS as a non-MT in the current content, except maybe on Ony if your guild uses a two tank strategy.
---
I am looking at upgrading my monitor to a 49" CRG9 ultrawide. Does anyone else play classic at this size? How is it?
---
Because of Undead's racial
---
&gt;Will of the Forsaken: Provides immunity to Charm, Fear and Sleep while active. May also be used while already afflicted by Charm, Fear or Sleep. Lasts 5 sec.
---
Best caster racial for pvp.
---
Orc's racial 
---
&gt;Hardiness - Chance to resist Stun effects increased by an additional 25%.
---
The best pvp racial
---
Taurens are better druids because of 
---
&gt;War Stomp: Stuns up to 5 enemies within 8 yds for 2 sec.
---
Then to top if off, Horde has Windfury totems.
---
Yeah, paladins are good, but that one class doesnt make up for all of the better racials Horde gets. And lets be honest, if Horde didnt have better racials, no one would play it.
---
Yes you can.  I've done it a hundred times.
---
Combat with a mob.
---
Those are problems as well. I’m on a smaller server. A lot of farming spots are “oversaturated” during prime hours. So resource contention is still a thing even on quieter systems.  
---
Can’t imagine how bad it is on huge ones.
---
One thing I never realized until playing classic. The world is ultimately pretty small, once you hit 60 and have a decent pop of 60s on your server. There’s only so many spots to farm x,y,z and they’re often full, unless you farm during odd hours.
---
Well, we are playing with level 51 against motivated Horde players with consumables, what do you expect.
---
This is exactly what I did. 18 hours day 1 got me to 16000/21000 and then I finished it off day 2. The first 4-5 hours were literal chain 7minute stomps with no opposition. At that point I decided this was too good to pass up and buckled down
---
This is sadly why ur average person with a life will never make rank 14
---
Wow what an absolute dick move, the guy took his time to write all that and this guy just straight up says “wow we don’t care” fucking asshole.
---
Depends what you're comparing them to. MC? Absolutely they will.
---
we had this happen to our premade but somehow drek stayed at 13% when he evaded and a mage tagged him again and we kept the tag and killed him in 5 seconds lol. I guess that's spell batching
---
Look at the difference between Deathbringer and viskag. It's slowness and damage range makes UP for the loss of stat from gloves I think.
---
Browsing through top of the month and this isn’t what I expected to see lmao
---
I remember people were flocking to level on new servers to get it since transfers were limited for some time. Never tried it myself though.
---
Where do you find this sheet?
---
 [https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/corehoundlooter](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/corehoundlooter)
---
ofc you don't have 100% uptime but thinking people can't do 200 dps is ridicules. People can do 800dps in aq easily so you only need like 15-20 seconds to clear the tentacles and you can go back to cthun..
---
are rogues decent at BGs though?
---
So is azuregos and Kazzak twice a week every week, but everybody loves them
---
Fun my man fun that’s why we play the game
---
Yeah I just...I've done MC through the very beginning of AQ40 twice now. I've set up my cash flow and rep grinds to be all prepared to do nothing but raids twice now. I do not want to get into this again unless making money is significantly easier than Vanilla, let alone being harder. I'm not convinced the efficiency from "ten years of theory crafting" and all that more than make up for the sheer volume of cash you need to finish the endgame of Classic or the weird population mechanics of classic servers.
---
That dude has such a massive penis.
---
Yep, looked up the picture in an old album, we're mostly in tier 0.
---
So I got about 5 of us who are unhappy in our guild. We would transfer for the right price. Right now it’s 4 dps with bis weapons (all ranged) and a main tank who has all his gear and can and does tank rag. We are looking for something mon/wed/Thur or Friday nights and are est. dm me for more info bc my guild doesn’t know we are leaving and I can message you all the drama we have so you’ll know we aren’t leavers. Looking for something less casual. Also we are alliance
---
I find warlock super fun to level because its a mini game within a game - controlling your resources (mana &amp; health) and controlling your pet.  lookup some warlock guides and get comfortable with fear &amp; pet control and you can start to juggle multiple mobs at once (fear one --&gt; dot)(pet on another --&gt; dot)
---
\- pet follow
---
\- pet attack
---
\- pet attack (at mouseover) 
---
other tips:
---
\- make sure to pick up first aid. super great on a warlock because of life tap.  don't forget you can bandage yourself when a mob is feared 
---
\- remember that mana regen in combat beings 5 seconds after your last cast so often times its great to finish off mobs with your wand (especially before the mid 30's where it becomes more efficient to be drain lifing instead of wanding).  Example - immolate, corruption, curse of ag --&gt; wand.  This will reduce down time between mobs.
---
i cant make it work i already try everything can someone help me with this? i can pay if someone sucefully help me like 10 bucks , please add me on discord Josemourinho10#7848
---
Warlocks have three mana bars.  Your mana bar, your health bar, and your healer's mana bar.  Often stated as a joke, but that's how it actually works. 
---
You just lifetap when you oom.  Your role is DPS so if you aren't getting healed, so what, you just keep lifetapping after you use whatever CDs you have to refill HP or mana (bandages, pots, healthstones, etc).  When you run out of mana, hp, and cooldowns you wand and wait for a gust of wind to kill you.
---
Keep in mind in long fights you can probably get off two mana pots and two healthstones.  You can carry every rank of healthstone, though likely only top two ranks are going to be used.  You can trade 1440 and 1200 healthstones with your fellow warlocks.  
---
To maximize fitting your cooldowns into the fight you can probably use your first mana pot after 5 or 6 shadow bolts, and get the 2 minute cooldown to start ticking.
---
Warlock dots are very mana efficient, so on particularly long battles with lots of foes you can manage where you dot and bolt.  Make sure your dots will tick to completion, dot the non-primary targets, dot the targets further down the priority list the most and with the longest dots.  In larger battles where a particular enemy might be up for a very long time it might even be worth using siphon life or possibly curse of doom.
---
it does not
---
PUGS maybe. Hardcore guilds always have loot councils.
---
We will see how it turns out, I just hope it doesn't turn out as bad as MC, since BWL should be quite a step up from that.
---
Not saying that good guilds won't clear it, but the average guilds should hit a few challenges at least, first boss, deppression room and the threat meter.
---
No, only if you roll druid or shaman.
---
Patch notes said: Bug fixes. It didn't elaborate, but guid is irrelevant for the fight now, confirmed by the fact that pets and combat minions get hit by wrath. Its inferred, not stated. On the same note, probability of both tanks getting knocked:
---
P = 6/(n(n-1) where n = number of melees, including pets/combat minions.
---
Considering that paying for an alt account is still cheaper than a transfer, not so sure about that.
---
Yeah I mean I don’t see how the players are at fault here either. I would be frustrated too I’m sure if I were getting ganked 24/7, but blizzard is who you should be upset with not the players.
---
projecting
---
Quickest way for Horde to exalted in AV?
---
It depends on your guild loot rules first and foremost. If anything, you can join PUG raids. Most of the Classic PVE content is quite casual by current norms: only pvp ranking is rather hardcore.
---
Solution: level alliance and mind control cap kill the buff dude in org .
---
There u go my friend ;)
---
Yeah I was thinking about this earlier, with the high base mama cost I normally try and avoid renew unless the situation specifically calls for behind able to cast on the move.
---
But I imagine there’s a point at higher +healing in which renew becomes your most efficient spell due to the high spell coefficient. I’ll have to calculate at what point that it.
---
Id say it really is. I am a casual player myself and have starting slowly grinding away at the pre raid bis. These don't take much time commitment as they can be acquired in dungeons that shouldn't take much longer than 1-2 hour at a time.
---
Afterwards I'd say your best bet is joining a pug group for onyxia/molten core. Onyxia isn't a long raid at all, so you should be able to find a group relatively easy every week even as a pug. As for molten core, it still requires a bit more time, but on my server there's always a bunch of pugs hosted every week with varying starting times and days. So if say as long as you can be free for 1 evening within your week and are able to find a pug, you should be more than fine.
---
Also make sure to check our your raid bis. Sometimes some of the gear can be acquired through other means (other than raids). Ie: Reputation farm, armour that is crafter, boe that can be purchased, etc.
---
My guilde uses dkp, so I would be at a disadvantage, but I suppose it's not impossible.  
---
I have no interest in pvp ranking, so that one doesn't bother me if I miss out.
---
So 50 AVs a day....
---
20 min queues (being generous) + 12 mins average games (his words) = 32 min per game = just under 2 games per hour. 
---
24 hours in a day X 2 games per hour = 48 games At best..... and that’s if he never sleeps. 
---
I’m starting to think this guy might be lying.
---
Horde having long queues due to faction imbalance (results of pserv theorycrafting) and wanting to have full honor game, meaning that they deny alliance fast zerging strat.
---
Alliance should change the way they play to face this long queue horde gameplay but they don't, resulting in lots of losses if you arent in a premade.
---
Meta could shift if alliance finally understand this but it doesn't cause "hey low honor but instant queue".
---
It's fucking stupid.
---
Just queue up and play, repeatedly. You can speed up the process a bit by making sure you're collecting items from dead Alliance and turning them in back at the base, but the most important thing is to always be in the queue.
---
Thanks for the tip. Will do
---
I was around then and besides the very initial honor system release where we had basically days long AVs alterac and then AB valley was dead. You couldn't queue to it at all it would take hours on my server and we basically had no queue pops at all (alliance by the way). Cross realm didn't change that. You could queue warsong or AB but nearly nobody even bothered to queue for AV. If you wanted to play it you had to sit in queue all day and often still didn't get a single pop besides having queued for literal 8 hours. German PvP realm which wasn't dead at all. As I said even with cross realms later it was like that. I never even got close to exalted. Experience may differ of course but that was my 'battlegroup'
---
My point was if you have that much gold he probably already put it in items
---
I just recently started playing Classic again, work was busy so it kept me away from the game for awhile. I have a 60 paladin on Whitemane already, but I want to start a new toon and I am looking for a leveling buddy! I am going to have a lot of free time in the next month, so message me if you wanna level together! (playing Alliance, willing to change server)
---
Add me on bnet or PM me :)  Sonzzy#1786
---
Odd people did get banned for exactly that in vanilla. I had a friend who got a 7 day ban for fearing people off the boat on his warlock and someone else in this thread said they got a ban for using mc exactly as in OPs video in 2006
---
Thank you!
---
Dude you're definitely the guy we're making fun of here
---
Need more posts about AV!
---
Taking the FD resist talent in survival makes FD resist very rare.  Almost mandatory for it to be worthwhile .
---
Once most of your guild's raiders get their gear from MC, they will only be running it for rag and bindings. So all the other bosses' loot will need a home.
---
You’re forgetting that the top alliance players are doing AV premades (made possible due to instant queue). So the best geared and organized players are not mixed in with the solo queue players.
---
Well, like I said, I understand how much being addicted to the game and grinding out an achievement can suck to the point where it becomes no longer fun. That’s the opposite of projection.
---
I have had warriors charge me while I am mounted and the result is always the same.  Get the poly off and it is over.  Typically I don’t take any damage beyond the initial damage from the charge when I am unshielded.
---
Yeah if youre going to pugs its possible, and you dont really need to put in a ton of effort with a guild to get gear, its usually just a show up and dont suck type thing for most guilds.
---
Drown in filth horde trash
---
k.
---
Gotta watch those anti-scamming videos about microsoft tech support scams. They sometimes say their name is Ben Chode when asked.
---
Which one? Both of them?
---
Warrior in t1 with 4k hp? Why did you feel the need to lie here?
---
Also, use defensive stance. But i guess complaining is easier.
---
First mage is noob to not have Ice Block, rogue is a noob to not have a trinket equipped. Well deserved Lotus where you just capitalized on other ppl being not prepared.
---
Mostly just to own in BGs. 
---
There’s also a top end on your gear so you can actually feel finished with a character, and the power dynamic in pvp remains consistent because of that as opposed to having huge fluctuations depending on gear. So you can have both a ton of fun destroying people who aren’t twinks, and fighting people who ARE twinks because you know exactly how strong they are and knowing matchups becomes more important. 
---
However there are also people, myself included, who think mounts kind of ruin bgs.
---
No.  Int is 1:1 with plus healing.  And crit is something like 1:18 with plus healing.
---
Wow you are super salty, its just a game brah, imagine being mad because people played the way you did not want them to play! At the end of the day its just a game but babies gonna baby I guess.
---
I was playing WSG on my hunter at 59 before I hit 60 and that was super fun lol
---
I feel like Alliance players on Stalagg are extremely vitriolic.
---
Hate when that happens
---
The ones I know that have quit, cited nothing left to do as being the main reason.  We had 2, fully geared out hunters after 3 weeks.  As counter-intuitive as it sounds, you might be better off finding a raid that takes like 3-4 hunters so you're always chasing an upgrade.
---
Way more than half, actually. You only got 5 pieces + weapon from arena. Everything else (neck, rings, back, bracers, trinkets, belt, boots) were from BG. And yes, basically every class did this including most high end rogues since the pve gear was gated behind hard raids that required consistently raiding in a good guild to achieve.
---
Blacking out the names made this harder to read jesus christ just show the names.  
---
Also tier 1 sucks and mages counter warriors in pvp unless you catch them without a cd or they are braindead.
---
You can already have variety with the existing specs, adding a new spec would be a complete clusterfuck and too much work, you would have to completely rework the loot tables and the balance
---
For fun I like Playing WSG, i dont like waiting 25 min to be farmed by a premade, I just want to casualy do bgs and I cant do that on my main, so I just have a twink so I can casualy queue for bgs from time to time.
---
Already spend 3k gold and several days on my twink, and I havent step into bgs yet im currenly ejoying the making of.
---
t.5 / d2 4pis BiS for the entire game, they mix it with Naxx gear.
---
Death ray and battle chicken are the only things that are bop. 
---
But you can make everything to avoid the hassle: netomatic, shrink ray, boots, cloaking device
---
True. I'm just saying either way the arcanite transmute is a fair deal at like 20-30g...not 5g. If you're only getting 5 you could get higher net income with at least two other transmutes after only a month or two. Those expensive transmute recipes like undeath to water will go way down soon enough, and even with things like elemental invasion the profit per 1 day of an essence transmute will never go below 5g vs 2 days for arcanite.
---
Yeah it didn’t look like a full reset, but the positioning definitely stopped dps cold due to LoS.
---
Yup, the meta evolution is actually so interesting to see.
---
As a horde player, 25 minute queues make you want to really participate and win.  It's hard to get into anything with a 25 minute queue, i.e. no 5 mans or alt leveling.  So the Horde actively work to win together.  We get stomped against pre-mades, so farm as much honor and rep as possible in 7 minutes.  Against other pugs, its very engaging 20 minute wins.
---
Edgemaster's are not statless. Having 7 or 8+ weapon skill is better than having 5.
---
The difference is not huge. But the FG gloves and swords are bis for human.
---
A slight exaggeration, but shoulders as enh for example, the first 5 bis are blues (discounting the purple pvp set because nobody has that yet)
---

Thunderclap is ass for aoe threat. Typically you wanna use battleshout and then demo shout and taunt a mob you want to priority kill so you can build threat and not lose the aggro. Aoe threat is difficult as a warrior and your party should accept this and try to be as helpful to you as possible by not running from you and letting you taunt/mocking blow loose mobs. 
---
As an aside classic threat plates is an incredibly helpful addon as it displays a color coded threat "meter" on mobs nameplate. Makes keeping track of what mobs you are going to lose aggro on easier. 
---
Also look into stance swapping macros that make getting into certain stances easier than having to click a separate button for each part of a stance swap chain.
---
How would you know? It was the same way in vanilla. Could be that you're not good at healing.
---
Wait, you think me posting when I pee while at work is more sad that being miserable in a game you don’t want to play but feel compelled to because it’s the only way you can get gear that will be outdated in a couple months anyway?
---
What?
---
What a self important arsehole. I refuse to believe guys like that ever actually have fun
---
Can’t use any without snowballs. That’s why I have a few snow machines to sell with them in the future.
---
There's some niche gear as well. It definitely expands options for feral druids. There's some good caster gear. Sure, not all of it is strictly superior to MC gear, but it probably shouldn't all be. I'm concerned that too many folks want to rush everything.
---
I'm in a harcore guild which is obviously loot council, but I also have a 60 alt mage that was in all greens a couple weeks ago. It's an alt so I could honestly care less about performance or farming prebis, so I simply joined random MC pugs advertised in world and rolled on everything that was an upgrade, even "bad" mage pieces like t1 belt. Already have 5 epics and over 200 SP from simply pugging MC for 3 weeks. 
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Also the nice thing about mage is I can literally put someone on follow, tab out, and play on my main. This is what I do for any pug that takes more than 2 hours to clear. As long as you tab back in and throw a couple frostbolts during boss fights, haven't heard anyone complain
---
I don't know anything about the fight, but something tells me stacking R14 warriors and rotating Reckonings makes anything killable.
---
Target a large "social" guild with raid teams.  The one on my server has like 3 seperate raids for Molten Core per week.  All different days and different times.  They are always looking for bodies.
---
Basically avoid guilds with raid attendance.
---
How many of each class participated? These numbers don't tell me much unless I know that.
---
Steve French is best kitty.
---
Yeah no, i'm horde and i can't stand the current 20+ minutes of waiting before each AV.
---
Thank you, this was more of the answer I was looking for
---
Who seriously atl tab in 2019... I use my second monitor...  (I somehow manage to miss the zepplin sometimes)

#**&lt;Tribute&gt;**
---
Horde | Whitemane (PvP-PST) | Wed/Thu 8pm-11:30pm PST | Semi-hardcore | Loot council
---
This isn't the greatest guild in the world, no. This is just a &lt;Tribute&gt;. Ohhh, whoah, ah-whoah-oh! :)  
---
Our main goal for **&lt;Tribute&gt;** is to foster a fun gaming community of like-minded and social players who put the needs and success of the team above their own. Our raids are relaxed, but focused - we get shit done. We prioritize loot and invites with the goal of gearing up efficiently, clearing content swiftly, and no drama. We're all adults here and many of us have families and/or demanding careers, so we want to be strategic in getting the most out of our game time. We think having fun with friends is critical to the overall success of the guild, and host "Game Nights" once every 4-6 weeks or so; Game Night normally includes some form of intoxication and free online games like Cards Against Humanity, Jackbox Games, etc.  
---
**Expectations**
---
We'll expect you to bring your best, strive to be knowledgeable about your class, never be afraid to ask questions, accept and give feedback graciously, improve the experience of the team, and be social &amp; have fun. If you like our philosophy and want to be part of our team, then read on. Even if you aren't interested in raiding, social members that fit with our culture are always welcome to join and hang out, level, PvP, and/or farm with us.  
---
**Raid schedule**
---
Our regular raid times are Wednesday and Thursday from 8:00pm-11:30pm PST (ends earlier on farm nights). This means we start pulling at 8:00pm so you'll need to be online, at the instance, with consumes, ready to go by 7:45pm. We will have other guild events such as group farming , PvP, 20-mans, old 40-man content, and/or GDKP runs on Saturdays. Our loot system is described in more detail on our discord.  
---
Interested?
---
Please join our discord at https://discord.gg/yZfrb8S, read things, and chat with us!
---
Yea that's why PvP gear is BiS for a lot of DPS classes mate. Really seperate.
---
I’m probably wrong, but I think it’s a DBM feature.
---
Are you looking for PvE because you're already on PvE? Otherwise you might make a great fit for our guild (we're Horde on a 60/40 Horde favored PVP server)
---
What's special about him?
---
Is current "classic" pre pet nerfs to remove special ones? I remember "Lupus" (sp?) used to do shadow damage and was highly sought after.
---
Some trashlord with superiority complex and low self-esteem. Welcome to World of Warcraft!
---
IIRC it's not.
---
If you're looking for a quick and dirty loophole, there isn't one. You really just have to play a lot of AV, and do some rep turn ins at the base here and there.
---
Faction migration happened because the server was already imbalanced to begin with.
---
Some people are such nerds lmao
---
This whole post can be summed up into "Stalaag alliance have lost on this server"
---
Yes you can.
---
I laugh at anyone who's grinding out rank 10+
---
 Bwl comes out in a few months and you'll get the same gear
---
i have:
---
death ray, chicken, netomatic, shrink ray, boots, mind control cap now!
---
Something i want to clarify for 2. It’s not about winning at all. It’s about clearing the highest honor objectives then losing the game as past as possible to “reset the instance” to queue again.
---
Me and fiance right now because I have more holiday days off than he does.

Yeah, after my first raid in MC (long time vanilla raider, didn't raid in classic til MC was on farm), I noted that people were flash healing like mad, and I was like what's the deal? and its because the boss fights are literally 1 min long, (and like Rag down before submerge), so there was no reason not to.
---
When I played back in Vanilla, I did a lot of heal canceling to make sure I stayed in FSR and what not, because each fight was a challenge. Oddly enough, the raids now have come back down to downranked heals because our tanks are so geared they don't really take damage.
---
I'm interested to see how BWL will pan out. (i.e. if people will switch back to good raiding habits)
---
kinda, didnt really affect my gameplay but for what i heard its mostly farmer complaining and pvper going for rank14 that dislike them since they control everything on the server.
---
Lmfao I often think how clutch that is in raids
---
It's nothing new, I know we are opting for a SW healer instead of a shadow priest for BWL. No reason to have an actual shadow priest in the raid really
---
What? You clearly care a lot, you've made a reddit post about it and have commented within that post multiple times with the same nonsensical argument lol
---
You know because what we need are more alliance premades.
---
Transfer servers.
---
Transfer to a high pop server with your faction. I'm alliance and transfers to heartseeker with 0 regrets. I can log on and find out raids easily.
---
That only applies to ranged hit
---
That chat font would annoy the shit outta me, jus sayin.
---
Only 1 renew though. I'm a hybrid for PvP so I never get to put renew on anything because a "more powerful spell is active" : (
---
Honestly I've wondered about this...I could chill out building cash during what I consider the boring part of Classic, transfer when AQ comes out, make 50,000 gold, gear up just fine by doing 20 mans every single timer, and start AQ40 where I left off before in Vanilla. Easily most efficient use of my time to see all the content I care about.
---
Sounds like a person from faerlina.
---
I’m a warlock and warriors constantly charge me. Like. Does he expect someone to come help him? Or does he actually 1v1 warlocks?
---
So you assume everyone only has one character/ has played non stop for 4 months and **This** is the sole reason why tanks shouldn’t reserve orbs? 
---
Either you are delusional or you have no argument besides “Reeeee i dont like it”
---
Leatrix Plus has the feature you're looking for
---
I love the self-important assholes who think threatening people with bans and blacklists is somehow intimidating.
---
I remember one time I asked a fellow hordy to party up so he could share the kill tag for the quest(I was looking in the area for about 10 minutes for this one mob). He moved his character to look at mine and /spit on me then killed the mob.  He was the only guy to make my list.
---
Few months? Its dropping in january.
---
Yes. For classes without a threat drop it's worth having. It use to be a total threat drop but I'm not sure if that's the case any more. 
---
Regardless, 18 seconds should give the tank plenty of time to grab ony if people bring invis pots or GCD.
---
The server populations are definitely a change, and resulted in most of the problems. Yeah, honor system as such has always been a nolife thing, and it's not my favorite thing, but eh, I just won't do it. That's fine. It's for those who want it, it doesn't have to be for everyone. 
---
NoChanges does work, so long as it actually is NoChanges, and not "Random Blizzard changes because money, and then using NoChanges as an excuse not to fix anything"
---
They're on a hard timer. No manual intervention required. It's quite a while but if the two sides don't complete the effort after a while it'll just tick over and pop the gates.
---
&gt; Our raid did just fine without priests topping off with r3r.
---
Viable and efficient are two different things. These small optimizations are more to prepare for taxing fights in BWL.
---
&gt; I don't heal people at 85% because they don't need to be healed. They are fine. Is that mana usage really necessary...
---
The thing is that they will need to be healed sooner or later. If you pad up that last 15%, the time that they do take damage will be that less severe. Hell, it'll probably just put them back at 85%, where you can do it all again. If you use r3r, you do this same healing with insane HpM vs waiting for them to actually need it and depending on regen and luck (hoping they don't get chunked) in the mean time.
---
&gt; Also - you didn't address that over a pretty similar amount of fights, my HPS is higher and my overheal less compared to you, and I probably was more efficient with my mana as well.
---
Comparing over two raids will be apples to oranges because we have very different fight profiles. For instance, my guild is over-saturated on healers; we have 11 healers whereas you run with ~8. This means there will be a lot more overhealing, and the HpS is spread over more healers (the total damage from the doesn't really change). The only somewhat nontrivial fight for us is Domo where there's actual stuff to do and there's mostly unavoidable aoe.
---
That said, I still parsed quite a bit higher than you on both accounts in the Domo fight. If want me to compare specific fights though, I can try to explain why they differ in the way that they do.
---
&gt; apples to oranges
---
But you can still compare them.
---
I literally just realized that I haven't even stepped foot in Silithus yet. Been 60 for more than a month.
---
Wow is technically physical activity... right?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OxMbupKW4w
---
Thanks for the answers. I wasn't trying to skirt the system in place. Just trying to figure out where to focus my efforts. I.e. killing rams for hides, capturing mines for supplies, killing enemy npcs, looting armor scraps and blood. Does that make sense?
---
12 minutes isn't bad. I've done 7 a couple times but not since the first week. Best I've had lately was 9, did that twice. After hanging around post game for towers to cap, 11-12 is pretty normal.
---
Here's a theory: when on an object that moves (boat, zeppelin, tram car, ...), a player's coordinates will be changed to coordinates relative to that object. So the object is now the new master. 0, 0, 0 for x, y and z would be the origin coordinates of that object, not the world. So I'm guessing in the video, the player is not linked to the object (the boat in this case anymore), but the player coordinates are still updated as if they were. And because coordinate scale is different for world vs boat (a change of 1 being much larger in the world compared to on the boat), the distances are quite big.
---
Maybe.
---
It's also the fault of Blizzard for not tweaking the BG to discourage, or make zerging impossible. It's also Blizzard's fault for designing the reward structure the way they did. 
---
I'm not saying player's don't have a hand in it as well, but this is how Blizzard designed their game.
---
Thanks for clarifying.. thats lame.
---
Twinks can be a bit of a normalization of battleground.  Yes there are costs associated with getting the items to gear them out, but it's largely just gold.  At 60 there is a huge benefit for raiding players.
---
Lower levels also open interesting mechanics.  Certain classes/specs can have a big advantage because they have an important talent while other's don't.  The 49 bracket usually has players with mounts, so some movement abilities are less important.  Things like Travel form and sprint are amazingly more powerful when people don't have mounts.
---
The "purpose" of twinks in a meta sense is adding more possibilities to the game.  A 60 only meta would largely be based around warriors and keeping them active.  Yes, other classes are very good, but properly support warriors tend to dominate.  At each bracket you get a new meta which can make things exciting.  To this extent the purpose is to give more options on how to play.
---
Retail enters the chat...
---
First mage noob? You can't Ice Block if you are sapped.
---
When did they say that? They said early 2020. That means in a few months
---
Imagine being so delusional that you post those two sentences with a straight face.
---
&gt; I know ya'll have questions!
---
nah
---
You wouldn't really have time to go world-pvp if the queue was 10 minutes long though
---
What difference a flying mount would've made?
---
Whenever you are resting, somebody else is getting ahead on the ladder!
---
Please continue to talk.
---
Even though its their life, its *still* just a game. Thats the thing, just because you decided to make it your life doesnt change the fact that its a video game. Its laughable
---
You have to have a crazy good group to get all the LTs and win in 8 minutes. You're hall pulling Drek without any GYs to get it done in 8 minutes. It's possible, but definitely not common enough to call longer games "bad".
---
It was 60/40 before which is kind of skewed but nowhere near what TBC is going to be.
---
Nah, they are just a bit toxic and love to grief...even their own faction.  But seriously, huge participation in Devilsaur mafia, honor trading with &lt;Washed Up&gt;, running level 1s they have parked in blasted lands into kazzak, coordinating with Washed Up to prevent other guilds from getting Azurgos.  The list goes on.
---
I remember in early September trying to get down to BRD in my 50s and grizzly had the BRM entrance, chain, MC portal, and hallway to brd methodically camped with about 20+ members. This was before much of the server was 60 or organized in any fashion. And it would take 5-6 corpse runs to get there. It was entirely just to grief people. They did this for hours at a time, for days in a row, essentially making brd inaccessible unless you wanted to spend 30+ minutes getting to the entrance, or even longer if your group didn't arrive at the same time.
---
Let's not forget back in August when they picked stalagg, joining up on the server discord and flooding it with racial slurs and other childish bullshit.
---
I'm pretty sure more alliance transferred off in phase 1 due to queues + grizzly + slight imbalance than we've lost in phase 2.  It's been pretty dead alliance side for a while.
---
Imagine being so delusional that you think that people who pick a certain faction in a wow are "worse" people. :DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
---
Thats fair. I see a lot of questions being asked in random comments that I'd often like to answer but needed a throwaway of course.
---
They're sticking to the original release schedule, if they are sticking to it 1:1 per phase we'll likely see it mid jan.
---
I remember this one.
---
Except the hardcores that we’re doing this will just paid transfer off for AQ leaving the horde who likely weren’t toxic to be on a dead and screwed server. Blizzard needs to put faction balance queues on this shit in the future to ensure these severs can’t do this.
---
Had a rogue snowball Drek out of the keep at 9% yesterday. We recovered but damn that was annoying.
---
What's the best bot to use for AFK AV Farming currently?
---
You need to be the tank to buy the item. Not achieve the rank and buy it later. You buy it immediately
---
Pretty much all internet threats are laughable.  Ban from some little domain some nerd has dominion over on the internet?
---
The type of people to blacklist/ban people over petty shit (like the reply in OP) will never be successful at holding power over anything worthwhile.  
---
They're **IRL losers** lashing out at people.
---
I personally don't fall into the trap of believing everyone who raided original wow was bad and 12 years old. 
---
I'd be surprised if there was not a guild that could theoretically kill kth but realistically I don't believe it was possible pre fix.
---
A reasonable argument from my perspective is that gear stats and itemization is already in it's final patch state. Releasing quests for gear that already exists and isn't a huge upgrade (not to mention that it doesn't actually add new content since you're only visiting dungeons that basically launched with the game) isn't a huge issue.
---
As it is we're not getting the Molten Core items as they originally came out. The big itemization revamp already changed the meta. The spell power revamp is already in the game. Gating these items at the very last part of the vanilla wow release cycle seems very wasteful. Same thing with the sunken temple class quests which basically existed as an incentive for players to do that dungeon.
---
had trinket equipped and ready to rock, pre-popped FAP, bear form charge in, lined up snowball perfectly....ladies and gentlemen we got him. 
---
this is a true druid chad. if i was on this guys server id be begging him to join my guild.
---
that would be one of these lol honest to god answer

Killing Balinda +lieutenants plus winning fast is the best way to get rep as Horde. But you're at the mercy of 79 other people as to whether you can accomplish that. Nowadays there are usually enough Horde players playing for honor that defense is covered just fine, so to give your team the best opportunity to win, go on offense but be ready to recall if it looks like the Allies are close to killing Drek.
---
And if you're up against an alliance premade, tough luck, you're not gonna win.
---
Strange I got exalted with AV very fast. EU battlegroup.
---
My recommendation is to go Fury, taking:
---
Cruelty 5/5
---
Unbridled Wrath 5/5
---
Blood Craze 3/3
---
Imp Cleave 3/3
---
Piercing Howl 1/1
---
Imp Battle Shout 1/5 (Option Booming Voice 1/5)
---
Duel Wield Spec 4/5
---
Enrage 5/5
---
Deathwish 1/1
---
Flurry 5/5
---
Bloodthirst 1/1
---
That leaves you 3 points left over.  You can start going down Arms with Parry 3/5 to get to Anger Management at 51, OR you can do 2/2 Berserker Rage and option out the last point to Arms.
---
What you'll notice:  Rage generation is more predictable, your threat stabilizes as well.  Your overall DPS may be a few percentage points lower (like not more than 4%), but you will be able to stay in defensive for most of the time.  Flurry is simply too good to give up for Tactical Mastery.
---
It also has a bonus in that it's a great PvE spec that scales with +str gear.  At higher levels for PvE, I swapped over to a medium speed 2H, and found it to have a high degree of utility once pulling multiples was a thing.
---
Battle Shout/Demo shout are good for initial aggro, but you really need to get to a situation where your rage generation supports tab sundering, and revenge when it procs.
---
There's a lot of folks here that will try to dictate a build.  If you like big numbers, then Arms will give that to you; but if you like consistency then Fury will deliver.  Both come at a cost.  Arms; when you miss and don't have rage; you're wasting 3+ seconds, plus I never felt like I had rage to blow on MS.  Fury clears that hurdle by attacking faster.  
---
You may not have extraordinarily high numbers in instance groups you're tanking with fury.  You will also be more predictable in dungeons.  Predictable means people get into their flow faster, which means faster pulls, which means faster instances.  
---
I found soloing to have better uptime with fury than arms, just without the self aggrandizing chuckle at big numbers flashing across the screen.
---
The Arms folks are telling you to go deeper into Arms  because that will solve your problems.  The biggest problem I have working up threat is not having enough rage to use abilities.  Arms is a rage dependent tree.  I'm not saying it's wrong to go Arms...  But I am saying I've recommended to a few folks in my guild to try Fury for tanking SM and RFD, and they're now leveling out as Fury.
---
When they call me I pretend to be a nun named Mother Jody. ( Cuz it sounds like mader chode ) and they fucking lose it every single time.
---
What skill you need to not fail black lotus?310 right?
---
except in this bracket 90% of players will be rogue or hunter as they are MUCH better than any other class at that level, Want to be a warrior, well there will be almost zero healers playing and they only have half a toolkit.  Locks and priests and to a degree mages have zero way of scaling dmg at that level compared to melee classes or hunters.
---
Are shamans sought after in end game raids compared to other healers? Does shaman compliment a warrior better than a paladin?
---
There are only 20 alliance because this guy’s “elite forces” he has recruited can’t take on a horde pug with only 20 so they didn’t join.  Screwing over alliance people who just want to play AV and not have to go through the pretentious crap.
---
What he is claiming to be is pathetic enough and if he is just pretending then even more so.
---
Yep. For the biggest benefit (for rep and honor), just stay with the offense or defense crowd, kill Alliance, and loot their bodies for armor scraps, blood, and flesh. Turn those in.
---
Anyone know of an addon that can announce when a debuff goes off?
---
I'm specifically looking for a [Nightfall](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19169/nightfall) proc addon so announce to my guild in /s or /raid. 
---
As a tank I can’t even invite warriors they refuse to have down time and charge straight away everytime I’ve rage quit every one
---
&gt;It's quite a while
---
Meanwhile on most servers gates will open in 1-2 weeks.
---
But which one did you pick /u/hrhashley???
---
That's only ranged hit in classic.
---
DB / CHT w/ Edge's is great since the Sword selection is pretty limited, and Maces even more so. As a human I would skip on Brutality Blade and wait for a Maladath from BWL. Odds are you wont get to pick up both, but the +4 Sword from Maladath is huge if you can pick up a Vis'kag or CTS later to MH, plus it should be Warrior Priority since Rogues can pick up the additional + Weapon Skill from talents to reach 308/309.
---
This is the exact reason that league of legends became so bad in the lower ranks. Everyone yelling about how everyone else is throwing the game not noticing they are 2-9 in lane. 
---
I found myself tabbing and checking other people's gear/score whenever I screwed up in league, like a preemptive deflection. Took me a really long time to break that habit but I notice it in every game I play now. People just try to rip each other down so they don't feel any personal fault for losing or struggling.
---
Fight Club discord
---
I know some you mother chud
---
Lol yeah a bit ironic
---
why do you opt for mind blast to refresh the weaving stacks? Couldn’t you use rank 1 pain again?
---
That fap was the key!! Gj dude ,AV hero and most in that bg will never know
---
Yeah it honestly makes me laugh.  Kind of a what are you doing.
---
Is this some sort of healer joke I dont understand as a restoration druid? 
---
\*\*laughs in innervate and HoTs and drinking for 5 seconds to next pull\*\*
---
This [tool](https://tegas.github.io/legacy-sim/#/spell) is instrumental in quickly analyzing spell HpM and HpS. I think you'll find rank 3 renew becomes godly in HpM quite quickly, and even decent HpS a little after.
---
Who said he was at full health?
---
So rushed DM, rushed P2, rushed BGs, yes still 1:1...
---
Good to know that the Alliance is shooting itself in the foot with this premade nonsense.
---
Yes ! Hp doesn't always reset as it should ..pretty buggy
---
But if you wanted good PvP gear, you had to do arena and deal with the rank system.
---
This is where resilience was an issue. It made most PvE gear suck in PvP.
---
What is the purpose of anything? There is your answer.
---
&gt;depending on how much shit goes wrong 
---
That's the point - in my experience,  trying to go as fast as possible usually increases the chance something *will* go wrong, and the time you saved by not drinking is outweighed by the time you spend ressing or corpserunning.
---
As for the drop chance thing, I only ever did casual raiding (MC, ZG and AQ20), but I never needed to run any dungeon 30+ times. If it takes that long to get an item, I don't think it's worth the time investment, especially since these lower raids don't require all of their members to be fully clad in BiS.
---
The sound it makes when it crits is the same sound you hear when you activate sprint. 
---
I have floating combat text enabled and it displays "Felstriker" whenever it procs.
---
Lol no worries. Good thing about wow is there is always room to learn new shit every day.
---
So when do you actually play the game? Or are you just in it for profit?
---
Pizza and buns but no saxx?
---
1.0 attack speed. His DPS is the same as other cats, so each hit is less damage than other cats, he just attacks faster. The benefit is when you send him on a caster he will fuck with the cast bar more.
---
Right now? Absolutely. Pop into a PUG, do some stuff. Or find a guild that doesn't mind a pal or three from your guild joining them. Pugged Ony last night, and got a shiny new purple ring. 
---
MC and Ony are relatively accessible, and most severs have them being done routinely. It isn't that hard to just pop in because you feel like it.
---
Seriously, people act like this is complicated. I always work with my healer, and some healers need more mana than others. Some want me to pull faster, it's all good. Hell, I've been on runs in strat and scholo where the healer is pulling the next group while we are finishing up the last one. Cool with me! And if shit goes south, oops, no big deal. Kill stuff and move on.
---
I don't have issues finding healers, and healers I know don't have an issue with me tanking (despite being fury/arms). Why?
---
Because we respect the group and aren't petty.
---
depends on the guild. shaman are amazing group healers for raids and decent single target healers.
---
better than a paladin? depends on how you look at it. As ele/resto, you will get more damage from a shaman healer than holy paladin. Paladins are better single target healers. Totems vs blessings? windfury is pretty insane but totems aren't mobile.
---
CHT 100%. As someone who got Felstriker week 1 of classic (luckily af), i had enough time to test the two outside of the actual theorycrafting. Felstrikers OH proc rate is pretty low, you can WA to show when it procs, but as a combat dagger rogue you already have more than enough crit (as some have said), and cht is more overall and consistent dps
---
Also they should add don rodrigo ring next game it was added to counter so much resists on pve sets
---
I don’t think you’re a shitty person. All my friends botted wow and rs in middle school in 2004-2007.
---
It’s just a game why you haf to be mad?
---
Just ask how their real life grind is going.
---
Dreamweave set will get you to 60ish if you are lazy. Least thats what i used. I like the spell power.
---
Fast attack speed.
---
Yes definitely
---
Once you're hit caped crit is the next best stat. 
---
https://bookdown.org/marrowwar/marrow_compendium/mechanics.html
---
Crit affects flurry uptime a hell of a lot until you get to around 30% crit and the returns start to fall off.
---
100% of made up numbers are made up, ngl.
---
True, and I guess at that point he's going to murder those few players re-engaging
---
The moment you treat it anything other than an MMO and a game, is whe  you have fucked up.
---
Other peoples incompetence has always been a point of contention,  why does It being through the lense of a game change that?
---
Clearly this guy is a wanker, who is trying to establish his "place"but still.
---
"ruined PvP servers" 
---
aka winning phase 2
---
That last point takes an eternity. I tanked half of LBRS with 299 skill and it didn’t movie.
---
Fd resists are super rare personally
---
The only thing that fucks me is if I fuck up and go too close to the pack that my pet is pulling and they go to me. But that's just a mistake, not rng.
---
Just don't play risky
---
Keep your spec,
---
 charge, berserker stance, ww, defense, demo shout, sunder X, tab sunder,
---
This kept me as number one in damage which put me way over on threat
---
Pretty sure that one is a hoax.
---
Anyone know how long it would take to be exalted as Horde atm? \*approximately
---
Uh what? Mages dont ever lose to warriors 1v1 without a ton of consumes and some luck.
---
Really the issue is someone in your guild who screwed the pooch, find them and crucify them.
---
We don't have rules or mechanics in the game to promote behavior with some people think is fun.
---
The actual .0 release phases are still on schedule if anything you're suggesting bwl will come sooner?
---
This comment literally doesn't make sense in reply to mine lmao.  Did you reply to the wrong person?
---
You can enhance heal all the way to BRD. 
---
At marah it's noticably nicer to be at least 21 points into resto but overall not required.
---
Bio break predates vanilla. We used it in Anarchy Online
---
Anyone got an alliance premade discord? I got epic mount but preferably one that doesn't mind non-BiS gear.
---
Wear FR gear for melee. Casters drink cheap fire pots.
---
Lol... not every mage is created equal. Neither is every warrior. Don’t assume every mage knows wtf they are doing.
---
Gotta see if you can snag those epic BoEs!
---
Lol yeah whooshing you on an American site where the main language is english, in a sub about a game with no indian servers to boot. holy hell this guy
---
I'll say it again. Where did blizzard say this? Because blizzard did say early 2020 for phase 3. They wouldn't say early 2020 if it came out the following month. Where did blizzard say January and when did blizzard say they were following vanilla realses schedule. Other then content.
---
You really dont even need to kite princess. The tank can keep agro on both and interrupt the heals.
---
Banner 15 % more damage?Also galv or drek give damage bonus too sometimes right?
---
Read the next sentence...
---
&gt;  For instance, my guild is over-saturated on healers; we have 11 healers whereas you run with ~8. This means there will be a lot more overhealing, and the HpS is spread over more healers
---
The boss damage to the raid doesn't change, but we have almost 1.5x more healers. This means the HpS across each healer should drop on average by quite a bit. Comparing HpS between completely different raids isn't useful. Additional compounding differences are damage mitigation/avoidance, clear speed, and strategy (we killed Sulfuron 1.5x faster because we did the aoe strategy).
---
I just got to 60 a couple days ago. Most people here are right: improved wands then spirit tap and down Shadow is effective. Here's what I did: imp wands, spirit tap, then shadow talents until mind flay, then disc talents until inner focus, then straight shadow. I didn't Respec at 40, so I didn't get Shadowform until level 51, but I never felt underpowered. Soloing was easy, healing instances was easy. I respeced at 56 holy/disc since I was planning to just dungeon grind to 60 anyway while getting some prebis, but I ended up doing some soloing too, and even as a healing spec soloing wasn't too bad, definitely harder than what I had before, but more than manageable.
---
Fuck all the premade AV douche bags that are literally ruining AV.  They are responsible for almost all the losses in pugs on alliance side. If they don’t get everyone in, they dodge and anyone who does join gets to start AV with 20 people while horde gets 40 people. Blizzard really needs to start banning people.
---
It's really obvious you're making these stories up.  I'm not entirely sure what you hope to accomplish.
---
I looked into the addon, but I don't believe that's what they're using. I've found an option to auto-invite from whispers but not from /s. Any ideas?
---
You sit down when you pee?  Yeah that’s pretty sad.
---
Not his choice, his guild is pushing them to
---
I'd learn it now and start selling pots.
---
Most guilds will have the recipe learnt by now so there might not be the demand for it later on. There is BWL coming soon so there will be more demand for the pots themselves.
---
on a pvp server ally alts need to be on a different account
---
As a druid tank I pull whenever I see the healer 25%+ and expect them to drink in combat or call for MBs. Always got innervate if we get an add.
---
As a druid healer I beg my slow tanks to just fucking pull already, I've got innervate and potions if we get an add.
---
After leveling, I didn't enjoy it at all.
---
Yeah, the idea is to try to minimize the amount of debuff slots being used, since there's a hard limit of 16.  Since Mind Blast has a casting time and SW:P does not, it does eat into your healing time...but you might be a bit strapped for mana with this build anyways.
---
Stop blocking out people's names on shit like this.
---
Warrior r14 gear &gt; BWL Gear in terms of PvP.
---
Brd at 50 and lbrs at 54 are very unlikely
---
I got you
---
There's loads of running involved duh
---
Any input from those who play on Grobbulus, as far as  recommendations go? I found out a friend of mine plays and we are looking for a good server to make our home. We plan to be Alliance. Would this be a good server to play on?
---
The NFL is also just a game but go ahead and tell that to the teams before the superbowl.
---
Alliance has that problem ouch.Just level its not like its hard for hunter no matter the weapon .And search on 60
---
Is elemental the way to go after 40?

AQ gates open automatically if you don't turn in the items.  It has an auto complete feature

Their punishment will be having to wait a little bit longer for aq
---
Got this aswell

So, technically speaking, Ravenholdt was not post-TBC. It was pre-TBC. It came out in December of 2006. I know, as I was one of the first 60s horde side. I believe it came after the 2.0 patch, but it was not up before BC.
---
Disarm enhancements. Interrupt elementals. Intim shout for some cc
---
Correct, you can mine in combat also.
---
Incorrect, first person in raid to enter instance.
---
joking aside ranking up for only 4 hours of sleep at night is not worth it at all. Even with 8 hours of sleep spending most of your time ranking is not worth it. Huge grind for little rewards.
---
Duo arena runs with a warrior for 5g a run on your hpal, then do something else on your warrior while waiting for resets. Takes ~20 minutes to hit lockout.
---
DPS meters occasionally for objective comparison and review are useful. But there's definitely such a thing as too much meter reliance.
---
You're parsing crazy high, meanwhile your warriors/rogues/mages are mostly parsing below 50%.
---
I'd say your back must hurt.
---
Your right, the NFL is just a game and would be equally embarrassing if some players acted the way they did about it as people often do in WoW IF it werent for the fact that the NFL provides an income for peoples lives and families.
---
Just keep questing and killing mobs between quests. Look for brd/5-man groups but don't sit around at a city trying to form one - if you can slide in and go, great. 
---
Ungoro, burning steppes, felwood, winterspring, EPL, WPL all have quests and good mobs to grind.
---
Until he pops reck and goes fear immune and 3 shots you with hand of rag?
---
That style of gameplay is boring. And if the healer outgears you, it was very possible for the battle to go on forever.
---
There is a reason that other competitive games(mobas especially) doesn't let healers do that.
---
You are looking at it wrong.  Population could be perfectly balanced and this would be the case.  Horde have the perceived advantage in PvP racial bonuses so more people who are PvP focused play Horde.
---
So even if you have the same number of level 60s on both sides a higher percentage of Horde players want to PvP so more Horde want to play BGs.
---
Just to clarify when I said perception on racials I want denying that the Horde’s are better.  It’s just that the important thing here is that people think they are better so that’s what causes them to make Horde characters.
---
You talk about being strapped for mana and didn't take any mana talents.
---
If you don't want a shadow priest, the disc weaving build is going to perform better unless your weaver flasks or uses runes/pots on cooldown.
---
MP5 from items isn't that plentiful.  Not on cloth and pre raid blues.  You essentially trade all your healing gear for mp5 and even then, it isn't that much.
---
I'm glad you're this salty too OP.
---
His raid sounds more efficient.
---
He's like that guy in high school who insisted on everyone calling him by the nickname he clearly came up with himself.
---
A warrior without a healer is an easy kill? Is this shocking to anyone?
---
Also given the fact that you are taking “deep wounds” damage. You were at least 2v1.
---
LoL @anyone who rolled warrior thinking it was going to be a face roll.
---
The income doesn't matter. At the end of the day the people who treat wow like a job get great enjoyment from it and have quite a big deal of emotional investment, the exact same as pro sports players. The line being drawn at monetary compensation is purely your own creation, and not something everyone will agree on.
---
Priests can solo just fine questing
---
rank1 mindblast to lessen the mana use
---
I find it weird how projectively relentlessly hardcore some players are.
---
As a social in my guild, an officer ringed me over my comment of "I log to play av and log off when I stop having fun" as an explanation as to why I don't lfg Dungeons. His reply was "I could only log on for raids, but that doesn't help the guild".
---
I've done hardcore Classic raiding. I don't want to do it again. I have many hobbies. My day job is very unsatisfying and I want to find something better. Someone with only one hobby and a set career doesn't have any right to critique what someone does with their free time towards a **social** guild member.
---
You can block any CC unless you're locked on frost.
---
As a gnome warrior tank it sucks not having that weapon skill. I knew it mattered, but honestly I didn't know HOW Much weapon skill mattered until I get to 60.
---
If you have a OEB, it will serve you better than DW any blue weapons that you don't have weapon skill for. But you should still chase weapon skill for DW'ing.
---
Option 1: Go Daggers.  Dagger skill is easy to get. Distracting dagger, muggers belt, etc.   Daggers are a bit behind other weapons, as their fast speed isn't great for Whirlwinds. But, few rogues go daggers, and every other warrior is human going for swords.   DW daggers with Weapon skill is better than any two epic weapons you don't have skill for.
---
Option 2: Go Axes and get the Expert Goldminer's Helm.  This is what I use when OT'ing or dpsing. It's tough to get though. As it's a low level item off a rare spawn outside Uldaman.  I checked the AH a few times a day for it and found one for 15g.  It's less optimal than Edgemasters because you can't use it and Lionheart helm. But if you can't afford Edgemasters, then you arn't gonna afford Lionheart either. So they are a great budget item that can carry you for a long time.  Plus, no one else alliance side cares at all about Axes.
---
I think that's the vocal minority though.  Most just don't want a real turtle.  And I don't mean the turtle described above, where 10 defend and we grab all the bonus honor.  That's actually the smart play for horde.
---
It's same as anything though.  Some people are just trolling.  Some really do want to annoy alliance.  But I think most are just trying to farm fast honor.
---
I am u/Slappah_Dah_Bass tribal chief.
---
I am wearing tiny briefs.
---
Granted you have the inventory space :p
---
LF guild on Atiesh Horde for my alt, it's rogue DPS, already grinded Dal'rends and working on rest of prebis
---
Agreed. So now what?
---
Warlocks shine come ZG patch.    Till then. Just CoE to boost mages dps
---
Well yeah so the goal would be profit for a lot of botters. I made money selling gold and powerleveling for people.
---
The real money was powerleveling for people, and so keeping their accounts safe was #1 priority. It'd be better to tell a customer you need 2 more days than a new account lol.  
---
An average user might use a bot for just a few hours a night to 'catch up' though. The amount of money you can make farming the same mob for hours can be insane with RNG drops.
---
yeah but once you got your stacks up, no since in taking a slot up with pain.
---
Ouch no leafs?! We are just giving them to our boomkin at this point.
---
Oh I know and I agree that for most enchants it's not a problem getting an enchanter with mats, it's just this specific one with outrageous mats your gonna be looking for a long time at least on my server.
---
I guess you've never ranked before or you're simply running interference but the way you get more rank points is by having a higher pool. The large guilds with several rankers get together horde/alliance side to get people who don't usually rank or the alts of rankers to get 15hks for the week so they show up in your bracket pools. This increases the width of each bracket allowing for more people to be bracket 14 and increases the number of rank points allotted to the entire pool. This guild and a few others do this every single week.
---
More often its those types of players that are the ones interrupting the play of the more casuals. This exact post is a good example of that behavior.
---
This isnt a post about someone bitching about being casual... lol This is a post about some guy who takes this videogame way to seriously being a dick.
---
Ban lists? For what? Your cancer premades that you'll bitch and give up in if we do ONE thing wrong?
---
Good ban me then.
---
hell fellow grob player, leftshark is my boy he camped the bottom of brd jump for soo long lmao
---
Even shitty guilds have loot council.
---
i completed the 8/8 heroism (valor upgrade) in vanilla.  the only difficulty was the ud45 run (but at least as the tank i could set the pace and if you ran with the same people or explained what was happening you had a shot of finishing in time), and the nearly impossible lord valthalak you had to summon in UBRS in the beasts room.  the coolest reward from doing all of the quests is the urn you're given where you can now summon valthalak on command.  want to troll or insta-wipe a random ubrs group?  just summon that boss...
---
I play on a 65" in 4k and it's pretty incredible.  Cant speak for the ultra wide, but blizzard def prepped the game properly to be run on 4k screens as it looks and runs incredibly.  Sunsets over the ocean are incredible :)  oh and the reflection of the night sky in still water.  It's just "wow" lol
---
It’s really not that shitty though. Like there’s actual players who are more maliciously shitty people than botters who just set up a program to auto collect things like flax in rs that are boring and repetitive mechanical tasks.
---
Botting has been the backbone of the economy of many MMOs.
---
Personally I think the people who purchase the gold from account thieves and gold farm botters are the shitty people, not the people who are providing the service. Using the mommy’s credit card cheat code to gain an advantage is way shittier than botting.
---
Most people will say to switch to ele somewhere around 40.  Another reasonable choice is to push to about 50, go resto, and live in dungeons to farm some pre raid gear.  I would change it up a bit, and say don't worry about it so much for leveling and just play whatever spec you think you enjoy the most.  Nothing wrong with enhance till 60; that's what I did.
---
The ele/resto hybrid build is just way too good for pvp, so it doesn't make sense to me to use anything else if you're a pvper.  I slightly modified the cookie cutter build a bit, and I do really strong in pve too, but the cookie cutter build is great when we get a bit more gear.
---
Haha. Good thing we have a free mount, or else there would be only 1 spell to buy.
---
Homie hes talking about a level 42
---
25 actually , are you 50?
---
 Foursome willing to try anything! (wink wink) Looking for large group activities once a week!
---
So, there are four of us, and all the people we started playing Classic with up and quit, so now we have to find some NEW friends! We enjoy light raiding, PvP, long walks on the beach, and dancing in the rain.
---
Deathblooms - Rogue - 60  
---
Faller - Warrior - 60  
---
Ironpudge - Pally - super close to 60  
---
Zuna - Priest - 60
---
We don’t have the best gear yet since we haven’t been in a raiding guild, but we are all seasoned MMO players and pretty damn cool if I do say so myself. :-p Hit me up if you’re looking for some peeps!
---
You still have a minimum 3-4 minute flight to get to a good zone. The alliance camp in alterac mountains got camped to desertion ages ago.
---
Nahh I realized that this takes up an inventory slot and destroyed the pet.
---
I assume hitters is autocorrect for botters - so I haven't been in the botting game since the first time around over a decade ago. The software I used (which I'll mention if a mod tells me go for it) no longer exists I believe due to lawsuits with Blizzard. 
---
Today, I don't know what software they use. I just know how it generally works. Back then there was a single popular super user friendly option then there were a few more complex (but free) choices. Ultimately they all acted very similarly, however.   
---
I used other peoples code, but I did spend a lot of time reading about anti cheat. This was back when Warden was new iirc, and the bot itself had to be able to attach to memory while remaining unidentifyable by a considerably obtrusive anti-cheat.  
---
I'm a nerd, always have been, so I have some knowledge in this area but I didn't code my own bots. I wrote all my own profiles and paths, customized everything, etc, as to avoid being caught, but didn't code anything.
---
Didnit to myself back in the vanilla/TBC years, and while I have fond memories part of me is glad it hit during my teens. I've given up on Classic, I just don't have enough time to devote to making something of my career, my SO, friends, and ultimately myself. 
---
I can't warrant spending my only "me" time just re-doing a timesink I've already experienced. Reading books over the holidays and playing some more casual multiplayer games with my mates has been much more enjoyable.
---
nah that as taken out YEARS AGO cause too many people cried about it since it as actually painful to keep a high rank
---
nothing intereseting or something we didnt know
---
It's OK wanting to play the game how you want.
---
Being a dick and being righteous about it is not good and just makes the people who work hard at this hobby seem like twats.
---
Rude.
---
No, I understood fine.
---
Your mom stands up to pee? You’d think you’d be more inclusive, then.
---
Idk, all my friends who botted back in 2004 are very smart and successful people. They work very hard and they know not to waste their lives on stupid MMO grinds. They were just making money off the lazy kids in town.
---
Fair. However, I think the impossible amount of materials obtained by bots are unnatural when listed on the AH and sways economies and lowers values of basic white text goods.
---
It's by far the best classic server.  Great balance.
---
I think most people are done grinding rep, so people would rather have 30 minutes of something enjoyable rather than a 8 minute pve race even queues are 20-25 minutes.
---
I got my .5 set in vanilla and I was in a small guild that didn't raid until ZG. We didn't have tier 2 gear and we really had no issues completing 45 min Baron. We just ran it with a good group that would bring one person each run to get their quest done. We were not min/maxers, just competent players. In Classic I hit 60 a couple of weeks ago and have not stepped into MC or Ony. I may join a pug for those eventually but I'm enjoying the experience as I did in the first go around.
---
dont be which guy?
---
That's not a solution. That's a problem.
---
have fun facing our turtle :)
---
This is a once in a lifetime deal (well second time I guess) to actually get rank 14 (or whatever rank you want to go for) on an official Blizzard server and not on a random private server.
---
I don't blame anyone for it, but I'm salty just like you.
---
It's only going to get worse from now on. The main source of lower level players will be alts of existing lvl60 players, and that will diminish over time as well. This isn't like Vanilla WoW where user growth was consistent. The influx of new players into Classic will be relatively minimal as the time goes on. I think this will have some serious ramifications down the road once declining player population reaches a tipping point, but no sure way how to fix it.
---
Jindo wont be so rough now that we have bear tanks.
---
Thankyou :)
---
If you are going to multi-dot, please only put one DOT on each secondary target. More DOTs than that makes it more difficult than it needs to be to hold aggro.
---
Unfortunately doing dungeons with overgeared/leveled DPS is the worst situation you can be in for doing damage. Things just die too quickly. So don't worry about it, it's not a problem with how you're playing at all. If you find things die really fast, just cast Shadowbolts. By the time you've finished corrupting everything, it's often the case that you don't even have time to cast one bolt on the main target haha.
---
What's this from?
---
That's so interesting. I've seen hunters everywhere yet I've constantly heard that hunters are low population and find gear super easily in raids.
---
Fair enough. As I mentioned in this post I see a lot of misinformation/guessing around this forum in regards to how bots act/what to do/whats being done about them/whats been done about them historically and so I thought I might try and help shine some light. The more people know about bots the easier they become to identify and report.
---
Yeah make a weak aura crit &gt; 80% or so and have the image be whatever you want, it's helped me utilize felstriker proc a bit better.
---
Had this happen with my friends they bailed at 30
---
Ah, yep!
---
It’s not a slowpush, it’s the usual strat after the initial wipe.  Also you don’t sit at Balinda, you go left then cut right for a flank with the entire premade.
---
This is the best ClassicWoW post i have seen in a long time. bravo!
---
I made all these trinkets when I got engineering to 300, and rarely use most of them. They just sit in the bank.
---
If you're a kid in 2004 creating your own lucrative 'business' out of gaming, then there's a decent chance you're a smart and potentially successful person.
---
I work in IT now
---
As the phases progress, you’ll see a huge imbalance in max level PVP. You’ll see players geared for all six phases. 
---
People in pre BiS blues, people in MC gear, people in BWL gear, people in Naxx gear there’s a huge power fluctuation between those and generally gear is what wins fights. Twinks on the other hand are all at their max gearing potential.
---
There are 10 spawn points each in all four end game zones. Goes for Silithus as well.
---
Thanks. 
---
Please put me on the ban list.
---
This entire post is a guy bitching about a guy with certain requirements for his group and kinda pointless. Don't like group don't join easy.
---
The sneers and eyes I get from Paladins the whole time.....but they all want to be summoned.
---
Dps is dime a dozen so you have nothing of value since you are easily replaced (think minimum wage mcdonalds worker) 
---
Tanks are few and far between. Harder to replace. Think (Mcdonalds store manager) 
---
Now when corporate needs some ORBs who are they gonna can the quickest? 
---
The guy who is dime a dozen or the guy who it not....
---
Heres another shitty example that might make it clear. 
---
Why do football teams value their QB more than the dozen Wide Receivers??? 
---
Could it be that there are 5+ wide receivers and only 1 QB and that the QB is harder to replace...?
---
I second this. Just got exalted in AV and I will fill any role needed to prevent my 25 minute queue from ending in a 7-8 minute alli zerg.
---
Maybe people like....don't take everything they see online as seriously as you do....
---
Yeah, I’m ok with that. It means I don’t have to grind as much to level my professions.
---
Not to mention a ton of people have alt accounts. One of my guildmates has 3 accounts for some reason.
---
Honestly I'd be careful using this as it's clearly an abuse to avoid slam resetting the swing timer
---
Fwiw all Alliance probably dealing with WPL being sucky right now.  Horde looking for honor have 30 min queues and WPL the juiciest spot.
---
My set looks cool tho
---
 I don't think anything unless he thinks we're getting AB early
---
Don't blame the Horde for playing the game. Blame Blizzard for not putting a faction lock like they used to, or lock transfers for a overpopulated  faction. I shouldn't have to stop killing the other faction on a PvP server just because you're a lower percentage. I'm rank 10 right now, if I stopped killing the other side. I'd be screwed. BGs are out now, so I couldn't careless about world PvP.
---
Weak auras will work for any conditional or trigger event, also any scrolling combat text addon should do the trick.
---
I'm pretty sure theres other specific addons that people will mention but I dont use them.
---
That's fine :)
---
I’m leveling a Lock also, level 45, and I noticed a good difference when I equipped shadoweave gear. 
---
But I don’t really worry about dungeon DPS while leveling. I’m skipping most dungeons anyway and  only doing the stuff I really need. Makes more sense just to get to level 60 and then start gearing up. And the drain tanking spec really isn’t meant for dungeon dpsing anyway. 
---
At 60 I will probably respec to SM/Ruin for dungeons and PvP.
---
The renew point is moot because it's based off total + to healing, gear included. If someone has 1 more + to healing they will cancel yours out. We leave all the renews to our top geared priest and it seems to work well.
---
You used wow glider and you're acting like you made this bot and know all the intricacies of botting in a game. That's the definition of script kiddie.
---
Yeah in bartender settings you'll see which bar is set to appear when you're in stealth. So go stealth and put abilities on that bar and theyll be the same keybind on your stealth and not stealth bar. If you dont see your primary bar changing when you stealth it's because you've set that bar to 'not page' which means a bar for stealth is not set.
---
There's always realm forums and Discord servers.
---
They dont need to have anything to do with world of warcraft or video games?
---
She wears underwear with dick holes in em
---
Thanks for the bit of positivity. I am POSITIVE there is an incoming banwave, i'm looking forward to it too. TBH, I know the botters have got to be feeling it too. Maybe that's why they're so blatant these last few weeks.  
---
I knew I'd get a lot of hate on this thread, but I think that this is a topic that benefits the community to be educated about. So here I am with all my fire resist gear on.
---
They are the minority, just like I’m sure the alliance I run into who /wave so I don’t attack then gank me after I finish fighting a mob or two are the minority but seem to be the only ones I ever run into. I think the vast majority of all players on both sides are generally nice but it’s the assholes that you remember.
---
Haha dude your logic is absolute horseshit and you know it 😂
---
“Games been out for 4 months”

“Nobody needs anything from dungeons”

“Most people have all their gear”

*posts on a topic about people actively giving tanks first orbs because of the supply/demand and lack of tanks for Strat live
---
**Still denies its a supply/demand issue**
---
What's your point? This has nothing to do with anything I said...
---
Wotlk minus the patch that got rid of downranking spells
---
Looks like horde would’ve won anyway
---
You monster!
---
All locks had aggro issues while I was leveling. It’s totally normal so I wouldn’t worry. I certainly wasn’t bothered and I was the healer.
---
Come to Hydraxian Waterlords. A RP server. It is full of friendly helpfull players engaged in all activities wow has to offer. And coming across a rp event is awesome to witness (even if you do not rp). 
---
Most players I encounteted are friendly an mature and people are all over the place.
---
So pissed off hes noggin'ed the whole time. Missed opportunity
---
I dont see how the map favors horde turtles... Alliance has far better chokepoints. If they just tried and played better they could keep those chokepoints forever.
---
Most of the time horde are scared to cap SHGY = icewing bunker is a perfect chokepoint since the GY is so close and hordes arent capping it.
---
Then  the bridge in dun baldar.
---
Its not that the map favors horde, its just that everytime ive seen a turtle fight happen... alliance just doesnt have the strength to even keep their ground. Horde overwhelms them everytime even tho the horde gy is like 1 minute away but the alliance one is only 30 seconds away at MOST, if you get unlucky.
---
Allys should be the ones overnumbering at that point since they have shorter ressing... but they still lose. Its defo not the map's fault but the players.
---
I got a bridge in London for sale too.
---
It's okay to say Glider.
---
Going through all the Cthulu mythos at the moment and then reading the Snowden book for some non-fiction. 
---
That reminds me, need to get through Divinity 2 finally!
---
You're playing a carebear MMORPG anyway. Just because you picked PvP doesn't make it any less carebear.
---
As a tank, I always wait, I have a UI notification went healer is below 40% mana.  Its always impatient DPS who think they are "helping" by non los pulling that caster group then getting mad when they die.
---
That ratio will change based on your current gear profile though. For instance, let's see how the value of int changes depending on your current crit %. Let's say FoL costs `X` mana, and you have a total of `M` mana. This means that you cast `N = M/X` times at base. However, each cast has an expected number of extra casts due to crit. Taking crit 'a' into account, your number of casts will be:
---
`N = (M/X)*SUM(a^n, n=0:inf)`
---
The geometric sum solution for `a^n` where `a&lt;1` is `1/(1-a)`. This means our equation is:
---
`N = (M/X)*(1-a)^-1`
---
I wrote it as a product for this next part. Adding int does two things: it adds 16.5 mana and 1% crit is 54 int (10% buff from talent). Taking the partial derivative w.r.t. int using the product rule:
---
`dN/dI = ((dM/dI)/X)*(1-a)^-1 - (M/X)*((1-a)^-2)*(-da/dI)`
---
`dN/dI = (16.5/X)/(1-a) + (M/35)*((1-a)^-2)*(1/54)`
---
`dN/dI = 16.5/(X*(1-a)) + M/(1890*(1-a)^2)`
---
So let's say you have a total fight mana pool `M=13k` (this includes pots and regen), a modest crit of `a=0.15`, using r1FoL with `X=35`. This means that each `I` increases your total casts by:
---
`16.5/(35*(1-0.15)) + 13000/(1890*(0.15-1)^2) = 10` casts (+2.5% total, wow)
---
If you have less crit at 7.5% because perhaps you've optimized for +Healing, then int yields:
---
`16.5/(35*(1-0.075)) + 13000/(1890*(0.075-1)^2) = 8.5` casts
---
So this means the more you stack int and crit, the more valuable it becomes. That said, each point of int is insanely powerful wow. I'll have to compute for +Healing in a similar way and do a more thorough analysis later. This is also why I want actual numbers from people's gear so I can have a realistic base to compare with.
---
That is exactly what is happening. I’ll try and ease up then. Thnx for the reply.
---
I specifically said I didn't make the bot. But I powerleveled countless accounts and even had other botters working underneath me at one point. I didn't write any code, but have a bit of an idea of how it all works and thought I'd try and share what I know with people.
---
Everyone in this thread hates me dude, I'm using a burner account. I don't think anything about this makes me cool, I'm not here to brag.
---
But you can keep the attacks coming I really don't mind. Thanks for taking the time.
---
Is it difficult to find comfortable underwear with such an extraordinarily small penis?
---
learn how to hide the fucking taskbar
---
So you hang out in the classic forums just to tell people classic sucks?
---
That's singularly the most pathetic thing I've ever seen.
---
No. I'm saying if he hasn't got on the zeppelin.  But after 5 Mins his character will sit down and become /afk.  If he had sat down he is likely far away(bathroom, food, wife aggro). If he has not sat down he is likely still at his computer but tabbed out.
---
From my understanding, the title is sufficient. The idea being the mods would be more lax on restricting "content" but keeping it to a singular day. Again, use this to inform your own browsing habits of this subreddit. I recommend making liberal use of the "hide post" feature
---
On the kill target use Corruption and then either shadowbolt/drain health/wand depending on health and mana balance.
---
Additional targets either Agony or Siphon so they can tick slowly.  Then Corruption ect when you switch to kill it.
---
Dont stress damage too much leveling.  When certain classes get a new main ability their damage jumps a lot compared to others for a few levels.
---
DOUCHE
---
I have been thinking about that. Demonolgy just doen’t feel very appealing to me tho. The 15% is very nice tho.
---
So...still shorter than queue times were in Vanilla?

SSSSS
---
I'm in the same situation. None of my friends lasted to 60, but I did find a great guild. The only good to come of it was my friends really wanted to roll PvE, so at least I didn't have to deal with the bloodbath of P2.
---
"Lose faster or we stop playing."
---
Zeppelin interval is shorter than five minute auto-afk.
---
Why don't hunter bots ever lose their pets after i kill them over 10 times? Do bots just spam their meat, or do they not lose affinity in pvp?
---
Our guild is raiding casually and we use suicide kings. If I cant make a raid I dont go down in the master list, so I can still get gear.
---
I think the assumption here is that it is important to top the healing charts, which means you have to snipe as many heals as possible in fights where actually keeping the raid alive is not an issue.
---
I think bonus weekends come out? Which means people will prob do WSG on bonus weekend
---
Yeah in my experience it just comes down to the tank knowing what they are doing. I was able to complete it in PUGs on my warrior a few times in vanilla and he was basically just wearing 3/4 pre-bis gear.
---
I think people will find 45 minute stray to be pretty easy now with how much faster paced the game is.
---
Cheeriosx, but links to his duels doesnt work anymore..
---
The history of Azeroth on the other hand seems like it would encourage brutal fighting between the factions. Not many people are taking real-life morals into their video games, especially when it comes to PvP
---
Wow thanks so much! This is very detailed. I pretty much understand now. I think there’s much more space to play around with bis gear for human/orc warriors.
---
Well charge would work exactly the same right? It would move you to the target and stun them briefly. 
---
Stealth... yeah I guess that’d be weird haha but why not? Stealthy slow bird?
---
You'd have to elaborate it's been a long time since I've been a hunter - but I think if you kill a hunter that just despawns his pet. If you want him to lose the pet, kill that first.
---
I've been targeted for fireballs in P2 shortly after using cloaking device, so I'm fairly certain it doesn't nothing to threat. 
---
I've seen several people post/say LIP does the same temporary targeting drop for P3/landing, but you'll have to decide if the trink slot is worth the consume.
---
In a Competitive OW game a couple of days ago, we had a duo-queue for DPS who were AFK on defense until 10 seconds into the match. After we got rolled I said "let's all try to avoid being AFK this time." 
---
They spent the rest of the match BMing the team. At least queue times for support are low enough that you probably won't run into toxic DPS mains twice in a row
---
Alas, blizz's reputation is low enough that this huge delay feels like none is coming in first place.
---
I'm hoping like hell too mate, but the trust just isn't there anymore.
---
I knew people in highschool that would bot, sell the account. Then put in a ticket to blizzard that their account was stolen. They'd play the account for a little bit again and then resell it.
---
Eh.  A LOT of the fun in classic for me is leveling. And it takes so long to level, I have so much game time left as long as I don't end up getting burnt out on it. 
---
But once you hit max level and start farming dungeons and raiding as much as possible, it starts to feel like a chore, which for me, gets old rather quick.
---
Dont break brackets my man, no reason for you to be in bracket 14 as a knight.
---
Yea, just join a casual raid guild :)
---
quite the opposite in fact it all fits quite nicely. silky smooth bb
---
You stay mounted while attacking. New animations for abilities while mounted, maybe that means class-specific flying mounts. 
---
Imagine a Druid in flight form flying around moonbeaming shit god damn that sounds fucked up
---
tbh I'd rather buy a slightly less ancient monitor than buy an expensive vga adapter
---
Priests are actually really good at level 19 with gravestone scepter and increased wand damage talents.
---
Yes.   Still doesn’t t change fact locks shine come ZG set
---
These kind of people turned me away from the game. It became too rampant.
---
it felt like that back in vanilla too, it's coming i'm sure of it
---
Rep is rep
---
Agreed...I envy the people not addicted to gaming/WoW actually. It's a hard pattern to break.
---
Yeah, depending on your server, MC pugs are extremely accessible and casual friendly. Lots of people have alts and stuff that what gear so there’s a decent amount of groups out there. Just keep an eye out on trade/off/world chats.
---
shhhhhhhhhhhhh
---
I literally snow-balled botters out of AV all day yesterday, maybe one or two matches that didn't have one in the tunnel...just jumping in place and casting the same spell occasionally.  
---
They had some really awesome gear as well, crazy to think all of these people are going to lose everything...maybe.
---
I'm not subbed and i'm getting a hernia over it or anything, it was just my first time being here and it was one of the first posts I saw. The meme sunday thing makes sense since everything I saw was memes, but this one seemed bizarre. Like to me its basically just posting a picture of a smiley face emoji and going "tfw you level up".
---
Right, that's my point. There's so few you just follow the route once and should have it memorized after the first go.
---
True. This shows again how blizz shoudlve gone the "no changes" route
---
Literally my life. Was doing ST last night (I'm a resto druid), our dps was struggle busing and to make up for it the tank was chaining pull after pull. Then, the slime spawn dude on one of the balcomies, spawned a fuck ton of slimes and he left me and a two dps ( lock who had no mana and was trying to lifetap, and a rogue)  to deal with it while he pulled another group, wondered why he was dying, brought the pull back to where I was stuck with a pile of like 20 slimes... I somehow lived along with the grp ( ty manatide totem..)... from there on he actually listened to my /oom and watched my mana..
---
My guild does dkp which I thought I’d like until the 3rd tank Druid took the hit ring off rag. Now I’d love some loot council
---
This is the upside. Even like a week after launch getting home at 7am and being able to quest freely for 4 or so hours. Complete bliss
---
Is this a thing?
---
Nope, like the kid house, more square footage, more round problems.
---
It doesn’t matter which faction. The symptoms are the same. Player choices kill the server. Not faction choices.
---
Get life?
---
Arcane Elixirs, not protection \^\^
---
100% agree we should have logical gameplay releases prioritized over an accurate release schedule.
---
Class quests at launch, it's absurd some are in and give great items (Bene, Rhok etc) while some ok items for other classes only come out when stupidly out dated, all because.. that one warrior trinket is super OP? Leave that 1 quest out if you have to..
---
World PVP like WPL live now, before BGs would have been best. Also why no AB, best BG but it came a bit later even though it makes BGs a bit rough with it out the mix.
---
T0.5 at or near BWL, ZG shortly after or with it as well.
---
That's why I hate how gaming is moving towards making everything squad based combat MOBAs.  Flaming is much worse on small teams, one underachieving teammate can tank your whole game and cause players to tilt.  If you are solo or in a large group flaming is much less of an issue.
---
Exodar never had AQ open. The War Efforts were auto. You still needed the Scepter. I raided BWL and quested with my guild in TBC to get a few bug mounts for the guild. Wotlk did a auto opening of the AQ gates.
---
You’re confusing arcane elixirs with arcane protection potions.
---
Careful, pot is a gateway drug that leads to meth and armed robbery /s
---
Have you ever attempted to review a server's economy and validate the impact botters have on it?
---
What are your impressions? Any hard data you've explored like AH prices and their relationship to botter population?
---
If you were asked to describe server population composition with botters vs humans, how would you approach getting an accurate answer?
---
I'm your mind, how does a ban wave affect the economy within the first month after the wave?
---
Say there were 100 bot accounts, how many of them do you guess make it past a ban wave?  I'm not asking why you think so, just a number.  I know you wouldn't want to get into the why on that one.
---
There are a lot of bad locks out there I am able to chop up pretty reliably. Granted I usually die to dots after, but the alternative is to just auto lose so we go in.
---
pfft, raiding and dungeons are infinitely more fun and interesting to me than leveling.
---
Yeah snowballs are the biggest bane of AV right now. They'll be gone next week, but it's also possibly one of the things that separates good premades from bad ones, potentially leading to more broken brackets.
---
&gt; Which is not hard to do. 
---
I didn't say it was.
---
Maybe, just maybe, those with the 60% mounts should play defense?
---
Just a thought.
---
These sorts of ultraparanoid strats on Ony don't actually help much. 
---
Phase 1 is straight tank and spank. As DPS, your ideal threat level is "high enough to eat a fireball in phase 2, and get it wiped." It is better than your healers eating all the fireballs.
---
It’s player choice that causes this. Not faction choice. Blame the players for making the choice. Blame blizzard for allowing the choice and not anything to help mitigate.
---
Noggen is op as a Druid I get it, but nobody wants to watch a skeleton shifting all over. So weak
---
I don't think my honor this week has been calculating correctly. The first two days it said 0 for weekly until my 3rd day of PvPing.
---
Then yesterday I got 350 HKs and it is saying only 28k honor, which can't be right.  Last week I had 400 HKs and got 70k honor. 
---
Have there been problems recently with honor calculating correctly? Is this something I should open a ticket about? I know for sure I got much more than 28k honor.
---
I'm your better looking doppelganger from the Walternate universe.
---
For the uninitiated: https://youtu.be/WIrWyr3HgXI
---
Not the alliance inside the premades.
---
You can get pretty far in 20-30 minutes.
---
Depends how organized each side is and if they’re rep or go or farming. Rep farming means each side passes by and goes for the kill and over, no pvp. Honor farming turns into defense turtles or attack/def splits.. more fun. 
---
Rep farms go in just a few mins, 5-10min. 
---
When you return from BG you land where you were pulled from right?
---
So you need fast access to a capital so you can sign up for BG again, yet fast access to a money area. You can’t place a hearthstone at a zone since you need it for capital city access. Hmm.  
---
For horse maybe UC to SFK or SM is best bet. Sign up in UC and run to SM to grind a few mins maybe do the dog handler boss and sell it all? Shrug
---
I am! I'll remove that lol
---
It's like 20 bucks, and the monitor isn't that ancient.
---
100% but I don't think its really the players choice. The only choice they make is do I want to rank or not. If the answer is yes you have to grind pvp non-stop and pre-BGs there was only one way to do that.
---
As a Horde on Stalaag I can promise you none of us were excited to have to walk around an entire zone for 30 mins to find one alliance so the only logical choice is to hang around high traffic areas
---
It’s also set up for a quarter of the populations.
---
You dont need gfpp for rag... never had a pug that doesn't clear. That being said I usually join half guild runs who need spots filled. Clear times vary, from 2 to even 5 hours. Like I said, if a pug is taking too long, I just put someone on follow and farm on my main account
---
I have 2 monitors but still alt tab out to use my browser. I'd rather cover up wow than cover up discord most of the time
---
SM is probably better than SFK, good point, momentarily forgot it existed somehow.
---
Health of the game should ficus on the game, not the overly long useless tutorial.
---
Yeah the good discord requires screenshots and someone has to be targeting you vouching for you who is already in the premade discord
---
Pretty sure no ally anywhere have queues. Unless other regions have more ally than horde pvping, but that's not the case for NA/EU
---
mugger's belt / distracting dagger / aged core leather gloves + Perd Blade  is better than OEB.
---
No for ruining orders game time.  AV wasn’t intended to be for premade. Ether make a investigation figure out which discord they using and ban or allow people to join as a raid. The shit needs to stop
---
Would you happen to have a link to one of those bids btw?
---
Yes. Shift+click if you have auto loot turned on. Makes it so you do not auto loot. Also if you shift click quests with Azerothautopilot you don’t automatically complete or grab a quest.
---
TBH I leveled Demo/Aff until I hit 50 on my lock. Now I am Aff/Demo for BRD grinding.
---
Demonic Mastery (succubus) and Soul Link add 18% damage to your spells as well as a 30% incoming damage "reduction", and aside from missing out on Siphon Life you can use the same rotation. Immolate&gt;Corruption&gt;CoA&gt;Wand/Shadowbolt (as mana allows)&gt;(redot if longer fight)&gt;Drain Soul. Putting succy on passive and telling her to attack when safe. 
---
I give no shits about trash mobs, and usually top dps on bosses since you can go all out. For trash I usually just drop a corruption and wand whatever the tank is on.
---
&gt;the exact same as pro sports players.
---
I'd wager 99.9% of pro sports players would never invest even 10% of the time they invest in their chosen sport if not for the income. 
---
The line being drawn at monetary compensation is not purely his own creation.
---
Was speaking about my time on private servers.
---
My second monitor luckily has DVI, but it's ancient. That thing isn't even wide screen if that says anything. It's pretty much just a discord monitor though at this point
---
It used to be 8 minutes, but now horde just like to turtle every game.
---
Why? Its not even a major part of the game.
---
In order of being a half a dozen people to zerg down on them there would need to be half a dozen people there, regardless of what mount they are on.
---
There aren't really that many mobs around that node, to make it hard to navigate. You get there alone on a 100% mount you gather uncontested. A flying mount doesn't add anything.
---
You get there with more people on a flying mount you have to fight. You can always watch from afar and come fight the last one even if you're on a 100% ground mount. Just don't engage and don't be far enough to not be able to contest the last man standing.
---
Unconfirmed. Auto completed was added in WotLK.
---
I really hope I’m not on his ban list
---
This.  If we don't get the charge off we're now at an even further disadvantage.
---
He plays 10 hours of AV a day? 
---
God, you know his dick smells like cheese and one arm is far stronger than the other. What a complete waste of functioning cells.
---
Well, you certainly didn't change my mind.
---
Is your argument that he can't offer perspectives on bottling because he didn't his write the code?
---
Do you go after doctors because they didn't engineer the medicine they prescribe too?
---
Do you go after mechanics because they didn't design the car?
---
Imagine playing a game only to sound like a f\*\*\*\* accountant
---
They can 100% pull without Marshall’s. In the same token, alliance premades often fuck up this pull
---
http://i.imgur.com/pK5kSAt.gif
---
On a PvP server now, people just walk padt each other and only fight over resources. Which flying has zero impact on.
---
Thunder clap will reduce the amount of rage you can generate due to being hit less often. 
---
Demo shout to pick everything up, battle shout then tab sunder/revenge. 
---
Dont use rend. 
---
Check about threat plates.
---
Store rage between pulls, dont spend it all on the pull unless required.
---
No idea. It's so cringy and awkward it's hard to look at those names.
---
Yes.  Server sits at about 75-80% alliance.
---
Renew takes up a buff slot. In our guild, priests are specifically asked not to renew the tanks as will it can remove a buff.
---
Lol world pvp is dead. You’re late
---
Spot on.  It has to be!
---
I did a /spit on an aoe farming mage because I asked him politely to team up so i can get some tags. He denied my invite after my polite whisper.
---
After I /spit on him he blocked me then sent 3 pms in a row. I found out cause he swore at me and I replied back something like "lol"
---
You sound like what a dad gamer would say on their 8th ragnaros wipe, and that's totally fine but you don't have to use all these complicated words trying to paint min-maxers as some toxic race of people.
---
Player choice is everything. Just like those survival games. Someone can become top clan/group/tribe etc. and wipe everyone. Everyone leaves. Dead server.
---
Or. You can encourage growth, PvP tactically. Maybe don’t wipe main base. Lots of options to keep a server alive and fun. 
---
Player choice. And players are choosing badly, like the most bullshit choices possible. Camping and killing FPs? Can’t kill when he’s out questing at least? 
---
Blizzard is also to blame for allowing these choices. Or at least not helping mitigate the choices damage.
---
Apart from gold farming what is the actual point of boting? Like I play wow to relax and have fun after a week of work. Leveling is fun, running instanced is fun, pvp is fun, I haven’t raided in classic yet and honestly doubt I will have the time to but I assume it is still fun as it use to be. What do you get out of boting apart from having a bunch of level 60’s that you don’5 plat. Am I missing something?
---
My girlfriend and I.
---
When people talk about ranking and mention HKs. Yikes
---
don't compare a competition watched by dozen of millions of people with national popularity and billion of dollars on the line with grinding a fucking R14 in a 15 years old game
---
Those are rookie numbers!
---
Dont need that deep pockets, the goods are going to be moved on barely above vendor price.
---
Otherwise you would need to have the Alliance characters farm quite a bit of gold for not much of a reason.
---
If you are going for Spiritual Guidance/Healing so you can spam renew on people, you are going to go OOM quick.  Using the mana talents from Discipline will help to mitigate it.  Look at mana reduction talents as bonus healing talents and it might help you decide which is better.  
---
If the cost of a spell is dropped by 10%, you have gained just over 10% total healing.  As in, you can cast 11 spells where you would have only had mana for 10.  Thus, if you look at the fight length and find that the weaver is going OOM frequently, is reducing overhealing from raw throughput more beneficial in having more heals cast overall.
---
CHT is a very good if not the best current offhand available for fury dps.  Paired with deathbringer you're going to hit alot more often with CHT due to heroic strikes qued uptime, plus more hit is more crit.   
---
CHT is very good.
---
Straight moran.
---
It's a very minor upgrade, but you're not getting a better offhand dagger than CHT until AQ40.
---
The 45+ minute games sure feel just like the half day games.
---
How about instead of being gigantic pussies and blaming everyone else you fight back? Your entire faction is straight pussy.
---
Ooze the shadow priest from YouTube?
---
Any resources you recommend for being a top?
---
Neat. Didn't know that.
---
Don't complain about the #nochanges movement. It's there to preserve WoW vanilla better than current Blizzard can. Do you really trust Blizzard to make the right choice? I don't. I'd rather deal with the unbalance of original choices made the designers than deal with the balance by the current designers. 
---
Also Blizzard wants no changes, it's way cheaper for them, they don't want to invest in classic at all. That's why classic+ will never happen.
---
So it isn’t an actual item or $, it’s just guild points? Thank you!
---
What does being promoted have to do with it though?
---
Die Alliance scum
---
That isn’t really a problem on heartseeker since most the ally are carebear. You can even look at logs most the horde guilds are raiding with full world buffs even. Spend a minute on the heartseeker discord it’s full of alliance complaining about horde gank squads.
---
Honor has been fucked since phase 2 dropped.
---
These are the people who ruin classic wow
---
These cringy try-hards...
---
15 MCs from 1 raid group: No BREs, and flameguard gauntlets
---
How does someone not have 100% mount yet
---
Yeah it's easier. So bad players who want to play with less buttons can get full bis and steamroll lower levels who don't stand a chance.
---
We gave our last leaf to our shadow priest to give him false hope because all of our hunters have it. We broke the poor guy's heart.
---
Mongoose and keeping them to use. I’ll not have to farm them again for a few months.
---
Garr. Baron Geddon. Rag.
---
What are you talking about lol. Did you not read what i wrote?
---
Horde is camping every single questhub there is in order squeeze some extra honor out of them.
---
Everlook: camped
---
Chillwind point: camped
---
Chapel: camped
---
Morgans Vigil: camped
---
Alliance can't move 5 meters before getting ganked. It wasn't this way in p1.
---
I’ve taught every woman I know how to pee standing up.  I could teach you too if you’d like.
---
&gt; Is there anything that can explain this?
---
Yes. You see, a small indie company like Activision-Blizzard doesn't have the resources required to properly staff a support team.
---
What staff they do have are busy enough trying to keep the servers live. This leaves no time for these overworked employees to fix bugs and issues such as you are experiencing.
---
&gt; but even assist in a raid can get you an ID we figured out.
---
How did you figure that out?
---
well it's not a pve server til blizz flips the switch and says it's pve. til then, i'll keep yeeting on allies making you quit the server.  
---
sorry you can;t take pvp on a pvp server.
---
I mean there are ways around it, like, you can hit intimidating shout when the bubble goes up, since you're hitting an absorb, it won't break the fear until actual damage is done.
---
I worked with a guy who bought his first car in college with cash, new all from botting and exploiting WoW. He cleared somewhere between $20k-$30k US botting and exploiting dungeon chests.
---
There was an entire industry of folks buying and selling scripts and software for these means and a lot of us that carried over from the EQ days had been hand in hand with developers of things like MacroQuest and Showeq. 
---
It was a pretty profitable calling back then if you were good at it and had the right connections. Especially before companies we're building anti-cheat systems I to their games and there were a lot of questions about the legality of doing so. There was also a lot of things happening in the clients memory that the server side never bothered to audit or check early on so warping and killing was still possible.
---
Over the last couple of decades it's gotten a lot harder to do and get away with, but because of that I think companies are becoming more numb to it which is problematic with a game like classic wow.
---
How would you know how horde are like as an alliance player
---
Be careful while doing WPVP near entrance also in raidgroup. One of my guildie got saved because mindcontrol+window
---
D, holding onto them since i need 800 of each for classic lifespan and they only go up in value as time goes on
---
 [https://ironforge.pro/servers/](https://ironforge.pro/servers/) 
---
Most balanced servers are:
---
\- Golemagg
---
\- Razorgore
---
\- Bloodfang
---
Why censor the name of the guy?
---
Waaaaaaahhhh mom they said muh font is bad why do I keep getting bullied
---
Yes. Skarm, another streamer/youtuber was also in that guild.
---
Most other classes I’d say smaller items worth less dkp are more worth it 
---
Orc warriors no contest though. Go DB or BRE (or maybe spinal if BRE doesn’t drop/it’s cheap)
---
Nothing, its gonna be shitshow until end of Classic. Im not complaining, it is what it is. Im just switching from hardcore pvp/pve to casual pve only.
---
I would have messed their pull for that.
---
Hope you have your brouilleur and some sugar cubes.
---
there are also just dudes who are AFK, not botting, which could maybe elicit a warning but definitely not a ban
---
this creates a lot of false positives and makes it harder to find the actual bots than u might think
---
I think the people who are "straight pussy" are the ones camping fps but you do you buddy. Enjoy your empty server and never getting another hk ever in wpvp.
---
To be fair if a bunch of whiny westerners complaining about their game bombed my ticket queue when Im getting paid ~$2 an hour as a customer service agent  at a company that manages 5 different businesses...I might tell you to fuck off too.
---
Biggest failure of blizz is the loss of the legendary customer service.
---
Go to an RP server. Rpers take the ban lists seriously. They are mostly a list of RP trollers and in Grobbulus case: white supremacists.
---
Keep in mind that the bay of storms requires something like a 350 fishing skill, so bring lures!  I have the big iron fishing pole as well as the glove enchant, so my fishing sits at 322. I use the aquadynamic lures for +100. The shiny baubles work too at +75, but you'll have fish getting away sometimes.
---
Can someone explain how he queued with a group as horde?
---
On my first character which I only got to 42 before rerolling was put on a banlist on Incendius because I didn't attack a druid 10 levels higher than me and was ganking everybody in the badlands... except for me. Because I was /dancing with him. I didn't feel like putting up with PVP bullshit at the time and I was shamed in the badlands general chat for a few hours. I didn't and still don't care, I just thought it was hilarious. Too bad the character's gathering dust, wasted spot on their list.
---
This asswagon must be ally.....nothing to do with being ally, just those short queues.
---
I agree. I do as much of my leveling as possible in dungeons and I also enjoy raids.
---
But what I said was that once you start farming them constantly is when it starts to feel like a chore and loses its luster.
---
If you can press charge it means you're out of combat, which means the header can drink, which means you can press charge. Makes sense to me tbh.
---
Not having to struggle to survive does wonders for the gene pool, no?
---
Damn I thought those dudes were "legit"
---
No my point very clearly is that those goals can be reached with out destroying your server.
---
Instead of asking if you had understood what I meant, you decided to create entirely your own narrative and argue against it.
---
This isnt an imaginary discussion you´re having in a shower.
---
They could have just as well done casual pvp to get the 15hks a week and be done with it instead of making the server literally lose entirety of their opposite faction.
---
There was no need to make the overworld literally unplayable to the opposite faction.
---
Hoy paladins are actually very easy to gear. You can wear anything! All classes prebis is your prebis!
---
Stop at exactly 6% hit and start gearing for attack power / crit. Having 7% hit isn't the end of the world, but it does mean that you likely have a potential upgrade that swaps out one of your hit pieces. Having 5% or less hit is bad.
---
If you're crit capping for white hits because you have all the world buffs, still don't worry too much about hit. Get that crit up high af and use such a slow mainhand that you're constantly hitting heroic strike. Then your offhand cannot miss while HS is queued, and your mainhand is a yellow hit (that doesn't ever get crit capped).
---
Maybe you two can help me understand this one, because I honestly don't get it, but IME, Alliance pretty much have to put in effort to lose AV unless the Horde side is really turtling or the D is full of upper-tier or coordinated people, so like...why do the people on Ally side want to lose instead of just get the win?
---
I've seen the situations where if there are less than 10 or so Horde on defense, Alliance wins before Horde can even get to the northern pass, and often as early as just after we kill Balinda (I'm still on a slow mount, and I've literally skipped Balinda to grab the bunker after SHGY and got the "Alliance Wins" summary before I got there before). Like...it seriously got depressing for a while after a chain of such losses, because it felt like we needed to have half our people on defense just to have a _chance_ of winning and it literally felt hopeless.
---
Ironically, one of the first winning matches I ran into this time around came from Alliance apparently doing the "just take the loss" thing and they didn't even bother going for the _essentially undefended_ keep (because Horde side was in "just get as many NPCs as we can before Allies get Drek" mode, too).
---
&gt; Not even fun as it often ends up getting corpsecamped on SHGY by horde mages...
---
Yeah, that one and its inverse are no fun for sure. I was in a stalemate position where IB and SH GYs were still intact and was effectively corpsecamped by the people coming back from SHGY. Nothing like getting just to the other bottleneck only to be nuked by six people freshly spawned.
---
Yeah, it could work.  The idea was to get the strongest Renews from the +healing deep in the Holy tree, though.
---
&gt;20 min queues (being generous)
---
Lol 20 minute queues?  We're lucky if we even hit the 20 second mark for AV and WSG.
---
Only epic boes drop from everything, as items like the taran Icebreaker and staff of jordan are classified as world drops with somewhere less than 100th of 1% or lower and could possibly drop off a level 1 mob. Rare ones have have a much smaller pool, sometimes just a single mob with a decent droprate compared to an epic. Same with uncommon with much higher droprates
---
I'm on Whitemane as horde and I constantly see my guild talking about how WM is one of the most balanced servers as far as A/H go for PvP in both BGs and world PvP. I've not hit 60 yet but I wanted to ask if anyone has info on the server if it's true?
---
Hey, I’m seeking horde players on Ashbringer EU. I’ve started playing again fairly recently and am looking for someone to quest / dungeon with. Kháos is my name. :)
---
Loot Council - Pros: Theoretically the best distribution of loot for the raid as a whole, allows the raid to get people 8/8 sets as quickly as possible and the most dedicated players get top tier (mageblade, ToEP, etc) pieces first.  Cons: With a few people controlling the loot, it can get funneled to specific people.  Often times it causes drama if people arent clear on why/how loot is being distributed.
---
DKP/EGEP systems - Pros: Fairest distribution of loot as an individual because it is all time put in to get loot.  Can be a good system if people in the guild are looking out for others, but can be terrible if people are greedy.  Cons: Takes time (sometimes multiple raids) for a newer member to get loot and if people are exceptionally greedy there is potential for items like a Brut Blade to get taken by a Hunter.  Obviously still his BIS, but not nearly as big of an upgrade as if it went to a rogue/warrior
---
Roll Systems (or Roll-10, etc) - Pros: Can get loot first time at raid, no need to worry about people raiding for months before you.  Cons: Allows for loot to go to people who may not frequently raid, may not be their bis or multiple contested items to one person with roll hax.
---
Those are the main 3 and the best I can discern between them.
---
Idk Gary Laser-Eyes made me chuckle.
---
Yep exactly, it has no value outside of your own individual guild.  It is essentially currency to purchase items within a raid, within your guild.
---
only if they access what programs you are running.
---
I tried to, but as a fellow frost mage all it really does is help him lol
---
This has to be an Alliance player.
---
I've run into a woman named Female, pronounced like tamales.
---
It's not a current issue, but I had 2 Caut Bands before I got my Druid T2 helmet
---
The loot table garbage in classic comes from inexperienced itemization compounded by changing class designs that occurred before original release.  You can even find a few pieces of cloth attack gear because priest discipline tree originally was going to be unarmed combat.  
---
That's not going to happen again.  They have quite a bit of experience itemizing and how talents work together now, As well as classes with established themes so they don't need to worry about the item needs of a class changing half way through the development period.
---
Nobody who played vanilla should think druids are a meme in pvp.
---
I like 40%.
---
You can also get more offhand hit (and raise your offhand "crit cap") by pressing the heroic strike button.

Great post and cheers for stepping up. My dad used to bot back in the day (not so much grind bots, but used a fishing bot) and still has the software on his computer and has never been banned, even though he hasn't used it since MOP but used it pretty much every expansion between end of Vanilla and middle of MOP fairly frequently, I'd often come into his office late at night and his character would be sitting there fishing for hours on end. Do you know how he would have never got caught? Pure luck? Really good bot? 
---
Another question: do botters ever get notifications for if people interact with them or certain things happen? Do you guys ever take the wheel if you notice somebody is watching you and you play naturally until they leave to kill suspicion? I assume most botters just leave the bot go and don't touch it, but I figure a few must come to their PC every once in a while to check on it. What's the most advanced bot you've ever seen?
---
No BREs No Firelord Chokers No Girdles from Rag. Shaman Shields, Shaman Shields everywhere
---
Which im pretty sure they dont, but I could be wrong. I didn't read all the fine print.
---
French and German servers are in same queue as English ones though
---
Same thing happened to my guild, however our raid day is on Saturday and my raid ID was "unlocked" after it reset by itself. I would be totally for classic+ feature that would display a message when you enter a saved raid
---
lucky you, grats on the loot
---
I guess you let other people do the dousing?
---
I am using a mix of Dreamweave and Shadowweave. 52 lock with 170 +shadow damage. I am running mostly dungeons though so the loss of STA doesn't hurt me as badly. If I tap a healer refills me.
---
Mining? I didn't know you could use a mount in DME. /s
---
Previously it would just bring up the launcher and I would still have to hit the "Play" button. Now it's doing it automatically.
---
I found it hard to do alone at first at 60 nevermind tryin to do it before 50. But i suck at the game too lol
---
Yes we all know that but when did they say January.
---
I cant imagine there are people doing dkp without some restrictions that would prevent hunters get brutality blade.
---
Damn I love these questions. I have answers to some, not to all, and so I'm going to answer a bit out of order.
---
&gt; If you were asked to describe server population composition with botters vs humans, how would you approach getting an accurate answer? 
---
Unfortunately - I don't know. I don't know how you could know, either. My bots generally looked more human than most, if you take the time to really customize it you can get away with a lot. Therefore, the answer is likely more than you think. Off the cuff, if I wanted to get this data I'd probably use an addon like census, then export the data to CSV, then look over the course of a week and see who is online the most then sort by who spends the most time in the same zones, then determine whether that zone would support botting (for example if a guy is in Westfall non-stop he's probably not a botter because theres no money there, but Azshara is largely not populated by players and has good farm mobs). Whether this is even feasible tbh I'm not sure. Because I dont have this answer, the rest are kinda hard.  
---
&gt; Have you ever attempted to review a server's economy and validate the impact botters have on it? 
---
No - I was pretty young when I was doing this so questions like this didn't even dawn on me. But not knowing how many users are botters, and constant AH manipulation by real players, would make this data hard to actually obtain.  
---
&gt; What are your impressions? Any hard data you've explored like AH prices and their relationship to botter population?   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; I'm your mind, how does a ban wave affect the economy within the first month after the wave? 
---
I'm answering these two together. Without any solid data on botter population, I don't have any hard data unfortunately. However, I think that after a ban wave there would MAYBE be a spike in prices of goods such as runecloth, felcloth, and rugged leather, but so many actual players stockpile these and control the markets that it probably wouldn't be noticable. What's more likely is a spike on any white goods that are rare enough that people don't enjoy farming them. Elemental fires, heart of fire, flamesac gland or whatever whelps drop, etc. I also think that that spike in price in high demand, hard to farm white items might last a while.  
---
So, I've also noticed that since transfers have opened there have been guilds farming empty servers out then transferring to high pop ones so that may skew this entirely anyway.  
---
&gt; Say there were 100 bot accounts, how many of them do you guess make it past a ban wave? I'm not asking why you think so, just a number. I know you wouldn't want to get into the why on that one. 
---
Fun question, I have no problem explaining. I'm really guessing obviously but back when I played I'd say a ban wave would hit 65-75% of botters. This time might be more, because a lot of them feel really really careless. Oh man, banwaves really lit the forums up we'd be talking about them for months. People would lose 5-10 accounts lol.   
---
There are two ways botters generally get caught. 1 is reports from users and inspection from GM. Even those bots don't get banned immediately, which is why it FEELS like blizz is doing nothing. Adding a lot of variation into your bot can help you avoid this.. mine would /wave at people and jump randomly. It wouldn't always go full health, he'd go back to town and sell/repair, etc. If you download a bot and spin it up on all defaults, you're gonna get banned. The second is more programmatic - Blizzard has a lot invested into anticheat software to stop things like this from happening, or at least pick them up. Some bots will do a shit job hiding themselves, and will be caught for that. Some bots will press every key with the exact amount of space in between every time. Things like that. Blizzard's big anti-cheat is called Warden. It's pretty intrusive as far as anti-cheat software goes so a lot of the 'free idk what im doing' type of bots are going to be picked up by that. 
---
Shit man I just typed a lot I'm not sure if I'm missing anything but feel free to follow up :)
---
Mages are easier when leveling, but at 60 with gear they're stronger just like how warriors while leveling are mostly free kills but at 60 they get strong.
---
If even at 60 you 'walk over' all mages u play against, we're playing very different games.
---
&gt;Release them before or together with ZG.
---
&gt;This will not imbalance the game, as they will still then be on par with other gear you can get through pugs, simply a different path. It will not impact virtually anything. Even if released before ZG, they will still not imbalance the game in any way.
---
No changes or changes that will positively impact the game.  Pick one.  Can't have two separate stances on the issue.
---
If you want to play solo, you can do so for free with your own private server. 
---
This is an MMO with an economy and structure that rewards time invested and skill involved. Multi-boxing negates both of those factors. 
---
Gross.

What’s a fakepoly
---
When I was rounding at the VA (all Indian and Pakistani docs), one of my troll attendings told me that if I should work on my Urdu to fit in more since I'm the only white doctor in the whole hospital
---
So he told me next time I see attending B, tell him "Ben chode, let's go round". He had me pronounce it a few times to get it right
---
Naturally I thought it was like the Urdu word for "vamos" 
---
Luckily an intern caught me and warned me definitely don't do this
---
There are sites u could use that are pretty legit as far as I've heard. Tos violation but so is doing it on Reddit I'm sure.
---
you dropped this \\
---
If you were a SL lock u’d still win
---
How is it a problem? You spend $25 you can play whenever you want, raid whenever you want, dungeon when ever you want,pvp when ever you want. I dont see the problem. Help me out to understand
---
Any mob which is an Elemental is immune to poisons
---
Man it must feel bad to hate all the time. Glad you’re gone
---
Paladins with no ranged attack to pull mobs.  Engineering solves that issue.
---
A good warrior tank doesn't stay in Def stance all the time. You swap around all 3 stances.
---
Funny, people have been saying WoW was going to die soon for like....13 years. I hope you aren't holding your breath.
---
I'm thinking about joining alliance just because theres so much horde, It'd be nice to try to help the other side out
---
All of the behavior you are so mad about is simply because the server started with a faction imbalance.  It has nothing to do with the people on stalaag,  those people are everywhere.
---
In PvP there are people that delete my stun or sleep (I think it's the sleep but I'm not entirely sure) by themselves. I am guessing it's an item but how do they do that?
---
It looks and sounds like the decurse buff.

Btw there are a lot of variations of DKP. For example you can have bidding that can be open or hidden. You can have fixed set prices that are points or a % of total points. You can have decays and so on.
---
I used dkp in like 4-5 guilds in TBC, EPGP for the entirety of wotlk in one guild and now dkp in classic and all the systems were fair and slightly different.
---
If you're in a BG, it's not a duel. Warlocks die a lot more than mages if the player fighting against is a warrior.
---
Warlocks are on top of duel competitions, so either warlocks in BGs are shittier than the best dualists, or they don't have all their cds up, or both.
---
Double-click the blizz launcher icon if that's what you want to bring up. It's perfectly reasonable to expect wow to be launched when you click on something that says wow.
---
what does that has to do with a video of a bunch of 60s on 2 of the top guilds of the server? obviously everyone in that video did at least one fucking BG in the week, lol
---
nice way to try and pretend to be smart tho. congrats on learning how player pool size works, what a great discovery.

Just because you take it up a notch doesn't mean you are addicted to it. That's totally different thing, any addiction is bad. But I get what you are saying.
---
Ohh man, I love your questions too.
---
Fishing bots are a whole different monster, and here's why - there are TON of them and they are remarkably simple to make, comparatively speaking. For Warden to pick up on something, it has to have seen it before. It's possible that your dads bot is not well known, some indy software, and therefore blizz never picked it up. Beyond that, you'd have to be reported. After that a GM would fuck with you to see how you respond to determine if you're there or not.
---
Notifications for interactions - it depends entirely on the botter and how complex the bot/user are. I used to have the ability to view my bots screens online with screenshot updates every like 8 seconds. I used this to monitor when I wasn't home. I could also use this application to send messages into the game from a remote location. It would notify me if I got whispers, repeat party invites, or simply if there was another player in the area for an extended period / an enemy player killing me more than once.
---
I did 45 minute baron runs with a full group of people in dungeon blues, none of us had stepped foot into BWL, I think our priest had 1 piece of T1, and none of us had ZG or AQ 20 gear. Shit I was probably wearing something stupid like stormshroud tbh.
---
Hell, I'm pretty sure I did that entire quest chain with dungeon only geared players, though I'm not 100% on valathak because I had to pug part of it.
---
Not it’s not ToS. I’m not buying g
---
They don't need to say january. They didn't need to say December for BG's but we all knew they would drop in December...
---
So, the Alliance is essentially establishing a pseudo matchmaker with voice comms.  The counter play by the horde would be to follow suit, if they were finding issues winning games.  As long as horde are getting at least 1 in 3 wins, I doubt there will be a push on the horde side to join discord voice chats and coordinate as heavily.  So from the lack of any horde chatter regarding this, I would estimate that the alliance to horde wins over all are at 50% or better, favoring the horde heavily.
---
From a more meta perspective, I recall barely winning any AVs back in vanilla, cross realm or not.  Are more wins from the horde due to the base skips or just a general better cohesion and strategy than the alliance?  From what I can tell from my still honored status with AV, the horde wins when defense is strong.  The alliance win on a rush and can win on defense but seldom put up a stiff fight.  So my thoughts are that the alliance as whole is more divisive, since the path to a win is either all zerg or turtle.  While the main horde wins are just to turtle.  Thus if there is only one main winning thought on the horde side and two on the alliance, the horde will win more, simply from having more people contributing to the winning condition.
---
i know i copied and pasted it so idk wtf happened lol thanks for picking it up for me
---
Something isn't adding up here. You're basically saying that in order to rank up, you *have* to do all these ganks that are causing people to transfer, leaving entire servers to die. I understand the pvp ranking system has a steep profit algorithm with competition built in, but if you quite literally hunt honor to extinction outside of BGs like has been happening lately then yes it is absolutely the fault of the hunter that their quarry is unavailable.
---
I realize server transfers probably weren't something people going for rank 14 could account for, but they should definitely have been foreseen. The pvp players stuck on servers they get endlessly camped on because of opposing faction players "not having a choice" were just going to quit otherwise. They didn't have a choice either.
---
Someone at some point has to realize whats going on and do something about it. If horde players want to get any honor at all outside of BGs, they should probably realize they might have to stop camping alliance players. They DO have that choice. But just mindlessly farming honor by any means necessary until servers die is hunting your food supply to extinction. This isn't news, because Stalaag isn't the first server to die to this trend. How many servers are going to die before something changes?
---
I think there's going to be an ironic twist that happens soon where it'll become faster for alliance to rank up assuming its not a horde dominated wpvp server, strictly due to BG availability. So while horde may have the better racials, alliance will have the better pvp gear. Would be amusing.
---
This is insanely fucking broken
---
Good work -- but holy shit.
---
This should be upvoted more.  Seems most others missed that part.

Imagine needing to maintain R14 to keep the gear.

**11/11 &lt;Senile Chieftains&gt;** | EU Pvp Shazzrah Server, Horde | Casual but serious raiding guild.    
---
 **Introduction**   
---
 "Senile Chieftains" is made for people who would like to see all the classic raid content (again), but are not able or willing to spend 8 nights a week playing. Of our 4 raids that we will run every week, we only expect you to attend 1 (read our guild-info for some extra rules concerning availability). There are options available for people who would like to raid multiple days.    
---
Most of us are ex raiders who have grown to old to raid to many evenings a week. Back in vanilla we cleared aq40 until the 'twin emperors', but because of the "tbc" release the guild disbanded.     
---
**Expectations from members**   
---
We are looking for experienced and skilled players to realize our goal of clearing all classics raid content. New players are also welcome, but keep in mind that most of our players are now 30 years and older so we will have a more mature guild environment.    
---
**Raid information**    
---
Raiding days are Mon-Thur 20:00 - 23:00 (server time). Once available, we will run organized raids on off days for lower tier content for alts and those who want to complete their tier/bis sets. Loot will be distributed by a loot council aided by a hidden dkp system.    
---
We are currently forming our 3rd raid group, but we are rotating people every week so if you join now you will be able to raid with the other raid groups.    
---
Check [https://www.senilechieftains.com/](https://www.senilechieftains.com/) for more information!
---
I'll definitely won't reroll to a new server just so I can enjoy the game simply because it'll take a while to level to 60 and get geared again etc, which sucks because I know it means PVP will stay just as bad for me.
---
That's exactly my point about being an ally lock! basically your only defensive abillity other than coil is fear... and you don't even get to use it as alliance.
---
knowing when WotF ends isn't a problem most of the time... I just die before I can fear again when it breaks.
---
And yea engineering is great and I'll drop tailoring and get it soon, it just sucks that you have to rely on other things to have a chance of winning instead of relying on the class.
---
Fakecasting polymorph so you waste your interrupt.
---
It's the daily post by an idiot who hates what he doesn't understand.
---
I used to sell wow services (when I was in HS / college) during the vanilla days. 
---
I sold power leveling services and sold accounts.  I would have up to 10 accounts being power leveled at one time. I usually kept them up for 8-10 hours and no more as your risk of being reported increased significantly.
---
Something that most, bordering on *all* healers and raids do not pay attention to: ***overhealing***
---
I pay attention to that stat more than healing done for the most part. Often times I'll be 1st, 2nd, 3rd in healing done, and have the lowest overhealing.
---
Meanwhile, the guy in 1st with 2k more healing than me did over 50% of his healing as over healing...
---
If you're running out of mana, make sure you're checking your over healing, as that's the biggest possible waste of mana
---
Unless poisons are significantly better, a high resist chance will probably warrant sharpening stones.
---
I'm just happy to be here, watching history be written. What a way to end the year!
---
Supposedly. The rogue set bonus is really good. Even shadowcraft's 6pc is solid into MC.
---
Depends on the botter of course. Your china botters are just farming gold to sell. Plain and simple.
---
I used it originally to farm gold and professions, and out of sheer interest.   
---
Imagine going to bed and waking up with a shit ton of timbermaw or argent dawn rep, or waking up with 100 more levels in skinning than you went to sleep with. Stuff like that.  
---
By the end of it I was botting other peoples accounts for profit - their goal was not gold it was leveling, my goal was $$$.
---
0 malistars, shard, cauterising or aurastone (I play a paladin fml)
---
The point is that when a game like that the horde actually tries to finish instead of just sitting around zug zugging for no reason and alliance can get into a new game that much quicker
---
BRE, CHT, rogue t2 legs nonexistent after 13 weeks. Only 2 dagger drops in total, 1 OEB. However weve been blessed with mageblades to The point we almost dont need em anymore.
---
VGA only? Yes, that's ancient.
---
Same my friend... Same.
---
Okay, so...basically do all the usual stuff. Then start finishing up the stuff that was supposed to go in Classic, and didn't. 
---
That fishing spot in the center of bay of storms? Make it do something. Ravenholt faction? Wildhammer faction? Yeah, flesh those out all the way. Toss in a handful of quests in underserved areas. Azshara in general needs a little love. 
---
The empty parts of the map get filled in. Is there a zone there? Okay, put a zone in. Build the whole lot, complete with dungeons and such. No new level cap. No flying mounts. None of that. I don't even care if nothing has a higher stat budget than Naxx. Just add variety. 
---
Mostly, I'd want talents, class balance, etc to stay the same. Perhaps a small amount of love for ret pallies and other particularly meme specs, but as little change here as possible. Maybe some better fist weapons, those feel unloved.
---
I bet you they still didn't find that damn quest item....
---
Screw you. You are sending Memes on mondays. Prison for a lifetime!
---
Ironic post, the ruleset in this sub is absolutely ridiculous
---
If the gains of winning were that much more than losing and the frequency of the losses were high enough, Horde would absolutely premade.  Simply because people will be more than happy to find a proper group and wait 15 minutes for an 80% win rate.
---
One of our officers accidentally started an Ony raid on his alt and the whole guild missed ony that week :( :(
---
Yeah love seeing the tears of alliance players screeching how this is hordes fault when literally every server that Ally were majority on was doing the same thing, this was clearly blizzards fault not the players for playing the game literally how it was designed.
---
eh no?
---
Still more honor per hour than a 40 min win
---
ugh
---
LOL
---
i did it here because it's a different perspective than your generic paid a few dollars a day over seas wow farmer
---
Nothing sexual, just bros being bros..
---
I also want to know how it went?
---
And the WoW icon, even non-flashing isn't?
---
As a hunter. I often feel as threatening to a Warrior as a ham sandwich. Don't get me wrong. I know how to play. But so many things have to go right in order for me to get the kill if he gets the charge off.
---
Let's assume FD, Ice trap, and scatter shot all land. I still have to walk my fat, dwarven ass, 25+ yards away with hamstring on me. While praying to RNG gods trap doesn't break early. 
---
If I get 28 yards away. It's usually game at that point. But honestly. I've run into a solo warrior maybe 5 times.
---
I do this with my tank buddy. She knows now as long as she can see me sitting and drinking, it's OK to charge in but she'll always be pulling with a shield. Once I'm standing it's back to dual-wielding mayhem! For 5-Mans anyway.
---
its great to click on the horizon and alt tab :^)
---
They're cowards, a higher enemy pop just means More to slay.
---
Having a BiS twink is very satisfying to me, as I will never have to grind again. No phases are gonna change my gear (despite phase4). There actually is a finishing line, compared to a lvl 60.
---
\&gt;  I did a /spit on an aoe farming mage because I asked him politely to team up so i can get some tags. He denied my invite after my polite whisper. 
---
You spit on an AoE farming mage because he wanted to AoE farm and get xp and u wanted him to share xp/tags? 
---
Have u considered that you're the ape in this scenario? xd
---
B
---
That's why I still play TF2 instead of Overwatch.  12v12 is way more chill than 6v6.  I can't even imagine playing something like Apex Legends which I think has squad sizes of 3.
---
Yeah it was a pug that couldn't clear MC. I heard they where going to go back the day after we left the raid. We almost cleared it that night if it wasnt for a GM resetting a members ID. We took an hour break after we realized what happened.   
---
Yes, dick move.  Upvote away.  I knew this when i typed it in the OP and i own up to it.
---
Sometimes they're blue, or even yellow.
---
And generally they're plastic.
---
Horde players can still sync drop -- even between servers.
---
It still results in the same 20-30 minute queues.
---
think youre right lol
---
Rogues are not even top tier
---
&gt; colluding amongst eachother to keep other players out of those brackets.
---
thats not how it works. I dont think you understand bracket stacking, or bracket breaking for that matter.
---
Yeah it does. I literally cannot level my 54+ chars anymore. Winterspring and WPL is being camped by gangs of 60 hordes trying to get honor while waiting for queue...It's literally unplayable. Considering leveling my rogue to 60 just so I can gank hordes. Fuck em
---
It also helps Flurry uptime. But the discussion is kind of moot until the slam macro is fixed.
---
but what is more boring: getting stunlocked for 30 minutes or chain feared?
---
Fear voidwalker **before** the warlock pops the shield. It's a pet skill and can only be used if the pet isn't CCd.
---
Nice! Sounds like a solid experience then
---
dropped a /s somewhere i think
---
Banlists? I remember back in TBC, back when people raided Karazhan (If I'm not mistaken) and I managed to get the tier gloves or whatever. Some person in the party or even outside of the party contacted me for ninja:ing it. I told them like, fuck no, I assured with the group multiple times if it really was ok for me to get them and they said yes. The person mentioned this list of ninjalooters that they've now put me on that all guildleaders on the server had access to.
---
So you're saying it would've been even crazier than the original gif? Damn I can't wait for flying mounts thanks
---
Thats rough, i'm sorry to hear that. Once you do something like that once you never do it again. I hope this post will save others
---
Yep, every mage/warlock wants it. Especially over Staff of Dominance, which casters will pick up as a holdover.
---
Hey one thing to add. If you are truly trying to do them all, you can craft the Gnomish Alarm Bot. It's not on lists online for some reason, but it's Gnomish only, but you can use it after you drop and have Goblin.
---
This too fucking cringe to have been written by an actual human being. This has to be some AI autoposter.
---
on blizzard's end, its really, really, trivially easy to detect most auto clickers or keyboard script
---
they're going to be jumping 1 minute exactly, with some millisecond spread for latency
---
no human does that
---
Nah, multiboxers are bad for the game. WoW is an MMO and a social game, and you are being anti-social. What you are doing should be banned, just like it was on private servers. Only reason it isn't is because of Bli$$ard
---
Closing in on lvl 40 on my Hunter alt with Leatherworking profession, wondering which branch to go into. Tribal is sticking out for Devilsaur but when I get into mail gear it might be better to go with Dragonscale? I just know I don't want Elemental.
---
Would love some advice!
---
Atm you will be fine just pugging. It will get harder over time especially with AQ release since you basically need to be in a guild for that. BWL will be pugged quite quickly on most servers.
---
Ok I have all that but a question I can't find the answer to is. Does more fishing skill give better catches? Or is it just the minimum to fish there?
---
This guy warriors

Then why bother bringing the tank?
---
We've had Mageblade drop every run for the last 5 weeks straight....not a single Perds or BRE in sight.
---
 No... it’s not lmao
---
Frost mages are definitely the worst :)
---
As a warlock, I'd just fear a few of the mobs. Unless they are undead. Then I'm spamming recklessness and hoping they get into melee range, or using my trusty voidwalker to split their pulls.
---
For demons, I'll start banishing.
---
It's weird that I have this down to a science.
---
Agreed with T.5 but disagreed with ZG. If ZG were in the game right now, 5 man dungeons wouldn’t get any play.
---
Same, but I'd like to hope this was just their own ignorance not realizing they only had 1 tank. I'll admit I get antsy in dungeons sometimes which is why I typically always roll Tank/Healer so I can set the pace, but if someone has a reason they're taking it slow, I always chill out. 
---
Unless I hate the person but had to run with them cause I'm in the same guild...
---
&gt;So like I said they are simply playing the game, no way around it.
---
There is a way around it: not griefing.  It's actually so fucking easy you can literally do it while not logged in.  The sociopaths on dominant factions could have just PvP'd like they weren't rotten cunts and accepted being a couple weeks (oh noooooooooo!!!!!!) late on whatever rank they wanted.
---
Phase 2 was 100% on the players.  Blizzard had nothing to do with it.  Phase 2 sucked because classic is filled to the brim with vile, horrific manchildren without a shred of decency or empathy.
---
We’ve gotten like 5 mageblades thankfully, seems to always drop. 2 BRES only and I own one of them :3. Tanks are annoyed that heavy dark iron ring hasn’t dropped a single time.
---
What a bunch of bro science bullshit lol
---
i think he's cool bro. has real determination
---
So a mage who's farming HAS to accept you're invite or else you /spit on him? LOL
---
Felstriker is propably insane for a fury warr when it procs.
---
Howdy Zandalar Tribe friend.
---
Have you ever read the ToS?
---
&gt;because some people are better PvPers than them. 
---
Roooooooofl.  Being a better griefer does not make you a better PvP player.
---
Nobody enjoyed being camped by an entire raid group all the way into BRM either. 
---
I'll take solo gankers over that.
---
You don’t get saved by just joining a raid group with someone saved.
---
This is why I’m so damn grateful I got mine. I used my loot council early on in the first run that it dropped, on OEB because I didn’t expect BRE to drop that night. Dropped a few weeks later and as arms MS I took it happily not expecting to see it for a while.
---
Because I enjoy the open world aspect of the game and questing? I don’t like that instance spamming is the fastest way to level, because it makes the game just like retail WoW, and not like an MMO.
---
Don't worry, the Mage has slow fall. They'll be fine.
---
they don't, they used to with warden but that was deemed illegal.
---
So have you actually been buying gold and nothing has happened?
---
Do you have the discord overlay on? That thing made my client crash on all types of stuff.
---
So have you been buying gold with nothing happening?
---
&gt;If the answer is yes you have to grind pvp non-stop and pre-BGs there was only one way to do that.
---
Or you could have just waited for BGs and done your grind then at no harm to your server, and you could both achieve your goals and not have acted like a putrid, foul piece of shit.  You acted that way, however, because that's exactly what you are.
---
If they are assist, yes you do. This is what got us confused and locked out.
---
Yeah, I remember this one time I was having fun, and then I remembered there was someone playing by themselves in a different instance, and I realized my fun was fake. From that day forward I stopped having fun.
---
Yeah I read the quests and take pictures of the moon too
---
I imagine he would cycle through them to check for spawns, not have them all up at once.
---
i dont think our rag has ever dropped a single weapon/shield yet...
---
and for a long time, there was no benediction drop and almost no paladin loot, but that got fixed in just 2 weeks furtunately
---
Or you can pull full health mobs into their aoe. 2-3 when they're mid pull will get them killed.
---
I am alliance and it really is impossible to quest right now. KOS isnt possible since you are just gonna get corpsecamped into the next decade but good luck.
---
No, it would be what everyone is complaining about AV being and the honor grind being. Then this whole subreddit would immediately: "oMg NoW tHeRe Is No StRaTeGy, ItS JuST WHoEvR W8s"
---
Imagine caring this much about someone you don't know on the Internet.
---
Sm carries are pretty easy to sell, at least on my server. I charge 5 gold a wing, and they go by pretty fast. Plus, yknow, there's an equal split of whatever drops in there and nobody needs. On, say, armory, it's about 2.4gold cash/number of people in group, plus drops, which is usually good for a bit more. So you generally can count on getting 7-8 gold per wing total. It's not gonna be Mage AOE grinding levels, but it's something.
---
[I've gone mad with my moderate amount of power!](https://archive.org/details/Kids_in_the_Hall_Nerdist_Videos/Kids+in+the+Hall+-+Mad+With+Power.MP4)
---
Yeah no, bullshit. I play Stalagg and Grizzly, Fusion, and Turbo all had Alliance gank squads constantly roaming BRM, SG, Outside Kargath, and in plaugelands. They were outnumbered yeah, but they still fought all the time and put up plenty of competition for when they were online.
---
Those guilds are transferring because it's too hard for them to rank on our server. Apparently Alliance on Stalagg farmed more honor than fucking Gehannas and without bracket rigging, so it was hell for them to try and go for R14 which a lot of them would do considering they are pretty hardcore players. They aren't leaving because they're "tired of being ganked", they themselves ganked plenty and almost every Horde who wants to PvP is afk waiting on a BG queue, not ganking the open world. Hell the Horde who ganked OP in WPL were probably waiting in a queue themselves and just world PvPing for fun.
---
Horde didn't kill Stalagg, Blizzard did by allowing the originally slightly outnumbered population to become massively outnumbered, and created the exact same situation except opposite on Heartseeker with a 20/80 Horde/Alliance population. People blaming entire factions like every player was in some hivemind collective all trying to grief the other faction into extinction are just idiots who don't understand how the game works. Both factions do exactly the same thing when given the opportunity.
---
All of the content in classic will be cleared by pugs at some point, so yes.
---
Yes you do, we had this happen to our guild last week as well.
---
Oh absolutely not. I’m down for one day a week for shitty low effort memes, but every game specific sub that allows low effort memes every day turns into super shitty circlejerk rubbish all day every day.
---
im an American... and i support this message.
---
Interesting thought. I've wanted to try SF, seems way more fun.. but have not yet because of the "30% crit or bust" rule, I wonder if having Felstriker would allow me to make this a "viable" spec early. My guild clears MC and Ony just fine like clockwork with 2 groups every week.. but I've always enjoyed trying to be high on the meters. 
---
Thanks for the input, it is a refreshing perspective and something I will play with for sure.
---
If you personally feel like #nochanges are that important, Then quit whatever server you're on that isn't "low" pop. because server size is a change. Kind of a massive one. 
---
They've all ready made classic +. You are playing it right now. Get over it.
---
Imagine having your ego inflated by beating 40 randoms with a 40 man discord premade. That's one big old yikes
---
You know bear tanks easily generate more threat at this point in the game and have more armor too, right? Not to mention their fire resist gear doesn't lose much (if any) mitigation potency at all.
---
You're stuck in 2005 with this mentality, anyone that pays attention knows bear tanking is more than viable and is, in fact, *optimal* in some cases. They're generally best as an OT in raids but can tank almost any boss in the game with little issue.
---
Why don’t u gather up 39 others and just run a train on one of the zones?
---
Imagine taking a 15 year old MMO that seriously.
---
This isn't true, we had this happen to our guild last week. We invited a pug, who was already locked, and it ended up looking our entire guild to the pug's id
---
Who is chuck noris ... for 100 alex .
---
Pvp trinket doesnt break polymorph.
---
Man you have absolutely no idea what you’re talking about :D Try to play the bracket(s) for once, man! I’m sure you haven’t yet and I can also tell you, the matches don’t consist of “90% hunters and rogues”.
---
I play a 19 FC Druid atm, on my way to exalted rep, I’m having the time of my life in this game again :D
---
Our guild name on Sulfuras-raids start at 1130pm!!
---
&gt; I pick the one that makes the game better, so changes.
---
Congrats.  You've just logged into retail.
---
It's unhealthy and unproductive
---
I needed some kills for a quest dude... and politely asked so I dont just suck one or two up for a while and reduce his exp and also let him know that i wasnt there to farm either...
---
Grosssss. PvP rats are the worst
---
Oh I'm a putrid, foul piece of shit? Huh well guess you learn something new everyday thanks :)
---
If you think that other people who do not give a single flying fuck about you should hold off on what they want to do with their time so it will benefit you then you are in for quite the rude awakening in the real world. Like honestly what is your argument? That no one on a PvP server should try and rank until BGs? Nice joke...
---
see https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ehn5g8/dont_be_this_guy/fcl7s3t/
---
I dont want to.
---
I use a shatter cone of cold build to AoE grind, why people say blizzard is faster is beyond me when I can take down a group of mobs with 6 spell casts
---
Socialist cowards milking other people’s hard work. The cowards do nothing at all to deserve their “honor”
---
Heavy Dark Iron ring is a druid ring. It's hot garbage for warriors.
---
Yes. And it's not against their rules.
---
I have a 34" UW and wow is great on it, I havent played on sUW but have seen screenshots
---
It's fun going into AV as raid spec in raid gear and just melting people from the backlines
---
I know alot of twinks that got Gladiator status on retail, if it matters to you lul
---
I'm honestly confused -- which guy in this exchange do we not want to be? Both are being obnoxious.
---
Or maybe track with the game enough so that you making the zeppelin isn't dependent on other people...
---
So, I do about 500 Reddit Posts a day with my left hand tied behind my back and I have an 85% upvote rate with 3.5k karma per post un under 12 minutes.  Periodically throughout the day I join new subreddits like this to farm some extra karma and scount for new repost material as well as create pasta lists.
---
&gt; They've all ready made classic +. You are playing it right now. Get over it.
---
Nope, the Classic+ most people talk about are around moving future raids into Classic, like Karazhan etc. post Naxx. vs release TBC. 
---
Also the larger servers are simply Blizzard saving money and overhead.
---
And 2h warriors generate insane threats
---
Alliance players who care about pvp are in BGs since their queues are instant. Horde players are in BGs as well, but their queues are way longer so they spend their queue time ganking alliance. Not much of a rocket science.
---
At 0%, 1% crit adds 1% crit.  At 99%, 1% crit adds 1% crit.  It doesn’t add infinite healing because no fight infinitely long to use it on.
---
If you don't see any difference between a random nerd AFking in Alterac all day long to have a bar filling up in a videogame and the top elite of high level athlete participating in the most important sport even of one of the biggest country in the world with billion of dollars on the line then nothing can be done for you.
---
The second one is worth going in full elitist mode like your life and carrier depend on it because it does. The first one isn't.
---
For a gnome warrior tank your BiS is ACLG + Perds + CHT
---
What a fuckin schlamele.
---
But then they will kill your friends and family...
---
Whatever you decide to do, you can still heal / dps just fine with 5 points into spirit tap and wand spec. As a holy priest, I have a + spell damage spec for smite spamming quests and mobs in the world.
---
I have witnessed this a bunch of them were emoting people with the character name and saying “you’ve been reported AFK please type /afk to clear it” I started asking them to stop and then next thing I know I’ve been reported 10 times for vulgar speech or something and got silenced for 24 hours, as soon as I was able to log back into the AV all of them who were part of it in chat were like OH HOW WAS THAT HUH?! OH YOU CANT SAY ANYTHING CAN YOU HAHAHAHA. They suck.
---
&gt;Day of announcement would be the time to sell.
---
This is mint advice.
---
I’m close with my mom, but not that close. I think I’ll pass.
---
Wow, that's actually depressing.
---
I have been running MC since about a month after launch. I have never seen:
---
1. TOEP
---
2. Ring of Spell Power
---
3. Felheart Gloves
---
4. Sorcerous Dagger (I know it kinda sucks but does it even exist?) 
---
I now have two level 60s and try to raid on both. Neither character has seen any of these items.
---
Skullflame, lots horde, strong alliance
---
So they should have delayed their killing of a world boss that guilds compete with each other even within the same faction, to help you against two horde?
---
I don’t know what to tell you other than the world doesn’t revolve around you.
---
seems really dumb to change the rules in the middle of a tournament
---
This seems strange.... well parses vary depending on fight length, but you're using more buffs than the average. are you looking at overall performance or during specific fights?
---
Hard disagree. No current content demands 100% raid spec. Furthermore, I respecced for the benediction quest so that right there is two eventual respecs. If you and your current guild can't clear content with 5 less points in holy / disc, the problem is larger than five points in one priest's talents.
---
"I rolled on a PvP server and now I'm mad!"
---
That’s what I mean mb literally our two Druid tanks
---
Sorry, I mixed up. I meant burning steppes not blasted lands.
---
So they were heading to MC
---
Can't test and verify I game at the moment but this should work. 
---
/cast [nomod][@mouseover,exists,harm][@target,harm] Shadow Word: Pain
---
/cast [nomod][@mouseover,exists,help][@target,help] Flash Heal
---
/cast [mod:alt][@mouseover,exists,harm][@target,harm] Shadow Word: Pain(Rank 1)
---
/cast [mod:alt][@mouseover,exists,help][@target,help] Flash Heal(Rank 4)
---
Everyone on stalagg is leaving, I wouldn't advise rolling on this server.
---
K
---
That’s because you get the same ones every year, I have 3 of each.
---
On cast.
---
As alliance, who mained horde during TBC/Wrath , this is my opinion. Horde are stuck with a queue, so they want to make the most of each match. Maximize their rep gain. Maximize their teamwork, maximize their moments together for the communal good.
---
Alliance, at least in classic, are more selfish and will work as lone wolves for their goal. If they are coming into the mindset of a ten minute win, they shit over people who fail the first push. Everything sucks because their initial expectations were not made. This leads to in fighting, and nobody gives a fuck. Too many chiefs mentality.
---
Alliance want their quick reward. Horde want to fuck over alliance. It's easier to rally behind the latter and still win despite hurdles. The opposite cannot be said.
---
It’s not really like that anymore, although I only experienced a fraction of what you’re talking about since launch.
---
I mean blizzard allowed massive server imbalances. They then allowed server transfers off those servers. So do you blame the refugees or the ones that allowed it to happen.
---
Interesting perspective, I appreciate the share!
---
In order to identify a bot, one would emulate what a GM would do?  
---
If so, can you elaborate on GM methods that are available to players and what type of responses would warrant a GM ticket?  
---
What information should be included in the ticket?
---
Whats d2?
---
So shadowcraft is bis for entire game?
---
Call it ClassicWoWShitlist
---
Whats the 4 piece bonus?
---
0 CHTs, 0 brutality blades, 0 BREs, 1 aurastone hammet. Not the best luck weapon wise, but 3 eye of sulfuras’ so we got that going for us I guess lol
---
It makes things more affordable to the majority, and I think that's a good thing... to a point of course. But like you said it can lower the value too much which ends up being a bad thing.
---
Very true, I was not thinking correctly.
---
Super late to the game but currently destroying my butthole.
---
if it's taking more than 2 hrs, he's not the only one that is tabbed out...
---
Yes this has not happened since the first week. Average premade game time is about 15 minutes now. Anybody claiming to get 7 min games nonstop all day is blatantly lying.
---
So macros are executed left to right and stops when it finds its first true statement.
---
Not at wow so can't test but
---
    #showtooltip
---
    /cast [mod:alt,@mouseover,harm,nodead][mod:alt,harm,nodead]Shadow Word: Pain(Rank1);[@mouseover,harm,nodead][harm,nodead]Shadow Word: Pain;[mod:alt,@mouseover,help,nodead][mod:alt,help,nodead]Flash Heal(Rank 4);[@mouseover,help,nodead][help,nodead][@player][]Flash Heal
---
Not sure if that makes the cutoff or not but I did shorten it some.  
---
This will make mouseover harm or target harm take precedent.  Then mouseover help then help then if no target you.  Holding alt will do the lower rank spells.  The [] at the end just means if none of those conditions are true it will show the tooltip for Flash Heal.
---
log on, check, log off, repeat?
---
I thought the 6 piexe bonus for shadowcraft was the thing?
---
Horde was so honor thirsty that every FP (even obscure ones like Feathermoon) was camped 24/7. 15+ death runs to BRM/DM. When free transfers came through, a huge portion of ally left, making it even worse. People re-rolled to different servers after they locked ally transfers. The final stab was Blizz offering paid transfers for the remaining people who didn't want to re-roll and that were only raid logging a chance to get off the server. This coming Tuesday, I bet 60% of the remaining alliance xfer.
---
Tanks have 100% priority on that ring and a good loot council will give that ring to a performing bear tank over a dps any day.  
---
If dps don't have hit then a fight takes .5 seconds longer whereas if tanks don't then raids wipe, particularly since druids have a much harder time reaching hit cap compared to rogues and warriors.
---
Also top dps druids do 800+ dps atm.
---
I mean, it's relative right? Relative to everyone else in 2005 they were the best. Relative to today? Garbage. You can watch the world first kills for Vanilla. People are standing around, keyboard turning, clicking abilities, etc. There's also factors like 12 fps, 300 ms, people literally disconnect in the WF KT kill.
---
People now are doing DPS in MC that was considered good in Black Temple in TBC. Just wait till the full melee roster has r14 weapons in a couple months.
---
TBC is a handy source of examples, both good and bad, though. I don't want TBC, but I definitely talk about TBC when describing what I do and don't want.
---
Have alts on your one account at different spawn locations, just cycle logging in to each character and check the lotus spawn
---
This dude is MAD mad and really focusing on REEEEE YOU DIDN'T DO IT EVEN THOUGH YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T REEEEEEEEEEEEEE.

Lmaoo
---
It could attempt to revive the pet on a loop, and if the pet is alive then it simply fails to execute that action.
---
I’m at the same and I’m burned out on the ~20 min qs but I need the ring and mount. I hope to get it before 30+ qs
---
50g would still be more then what I spent on all of them
---
Yes, we are collectively disappointed in you
---
You probably are going to run out of room trying to do that many things in a single macro:
---
    /cast [mod:alt,@mouseover,harm] B;[mod:alt,harm] B
---
    /cast [nomod:alt,@mouseover,harm] A;[nomod:alt,harm] A
---
    /cast [mod:alt,@mouseover,harm] D;[mod:alt,harm] D
---
    /cast [nomod:alt,@mouseover,harm] C;[nomod:alt,harm] C
---
You're doing eight different checks in a single macro, so space will be an issue.  You can skip all the 'nodead' type stuff because all it does is give you an error message, so that will save some space.
---
Scouting for his AV frat chad alpha chad
---
Salty little snail, sell it for what you can get for it. If you want to keep the value of something high, though, don't sell it all at once
---
it becomes the 4 set bonus when you upgrade it
---
Salty snail my dude
---
They may not be level 62, but there were definitely greens in TBC that fairly quickly invalidated gear that people had spent ages raiding for. 
---
I'd agree that TBC style itemization that invalidates the old gear almost entirely is a great reason to instantly quit.
---
You're what's wrong with the game then mate. You don't have to gank endlessly, never did. Damn zugzugs.
---
I want none of those things.
---
*slow clap* impressive Mr.Bond.
---
You can out DPS mages on core hound packs/imps in MC if you proc right away. I can see several trash pack places in every raid it will stay relevant - Suppresion room in BWL, Bug tunnel in AQ, some of the mass trash in Naxx even.
---
There are a fuckload of honor farming bots right now and it's infuriating. A lot of these assholes are playing their casual 4-5 hours, then turning on the bot to play the remaining 20 hours .... to anyone that's losing sleep and sanity doing honest honor farming, these fuckers are human garbage that deserve public torture.
---
I still don't understand why you think he's not qualified to talk about botting.  
---
It's like you're saying a race car driver could never drive as well as the guy who designed the car, nor ever be quallified to talk about it.
---
For your own credentials, the only difference I'm seeing is that you hung out on some internet forums and chatted with guys who wrote bot programs.  That's nothing special, my man.  
---
I don't understand the hostility.  If people are interested, they'll ask.  If you want to join in, join in.  
---
Are you here to contribute or just be a crotchety old guy who used to cheat and knows everything, but too important to have a decent conversation?
---
Grow up.
---
I wouldn’t count on BWL next month considering 8.3 is coming out. February is the safe bet.
---
Fair points, I've noticed, now being honest I'm playing Regular Retail wow, but I've noticed Alliance blitz past towers, and rush the graveyard right before the actual stronghold, they hold that then they push into the stronghold, take the second grave yard but with no communication there is no unified group.  It's 40 people with 10 people here 10 people there and smaller groups roaming around getting picked off by the horde group that moves together. 
---
Sadly there is no ... easy way to try and direct a large group of people who don't want to seriously work together.
---
It's a double edged sword because being able to escape stress enjoy doing something you love is integral to being healthy, but unfortunately it's too easy to go overboard. Anyone struggling with being addicted with technology in general should pick up "digital minimalism" by cal newport, and maybe I'll make the same recommendation with "what the internet is doing to our brains" by Nicholas Carr once I'm done. Either way, you're not alone and it's not impossible
---
Aye does nothing a lip or pala bop doesnt do. If you are a squishy use lip or die. Else use defensive ability shout on voice u need healing move to the tank spot dont attack and let tank get aggro. She hits like a wet noodle almost anyone can tank her.
---
Just a point about the nodead thing.  it can be important.  Say you set up your macro to look for @mouseover,harm first then maybe a help target later.  If you have a helpful targeted, but are accidentally mouseover a dead harm you will get the error instead of casting the helpful on the target.  Its a matter of choice which you want to happen but its not necessarily best practice to skip nodead just to save space.
---
There could be some quests that offer unique items used at max level like skull of impending doom or nifty stopwatch.
---
\&gt;  You must be new to classic, or dont play the game. 
---
I played the og but i'm currently level 60 and rank 8 / and our first rag kill was 11/10 so not 2 fast but we're a casual 1 day / week guild after all.
---
\&gt;  Many people teamed up to share kills for quests. i simply just asked, no way was i obligated. He was rude, so I did an emote. Apparently it triggered him so much he blocked me. 
---
Yeah so rude declining your invite your ego must have been really hurt xD. It's not even a named mob you're legit just trying to leech on him for your kill x-amount quest. There's enough of them just kill them yourself.
---
\&gt;  Do I need to draw it with crayons for you to understand? 
---
Yeah I have never spat on any1 because they didn't let me leech on them. I really don't understand your mentality but whatever makes you proud :)) You sound like an entitled little bitch.
---
Thats insane lol
---
And holy paladins (don't hate me)
---
D) saving them until guild uses epgp, then selling them to people who don't have them for a slight increase in price. Haha!
---
Never seen one in the wild. On Firemaw EU there is no such thing as an uncontested zone. Maybe I just dont pay enough attention. Even in AV I have yet to see one.
---
This happened to our group with Onyxia.  We formed a pug Ony and the first guy who entered was already saved and he must have realized it because he quickly dropped group and hearthed out without saying anything.  The rest of the group which took almost 2 hours to assemble got screwed.
---
Why is he required to accept your invite? And why did you spit on him after he declined. You literally are just making yourself look bad.
---
No but roll a PVE server for best leveling experience
---
Your current macro looks like it would work according to what you want. Is it not working?
---
Macros are processed in order and will execute the first condition that is true.
---
That's pretty genius...
---
That's a good point, especially with mouseovers.
---
eventually they'll spend 25 dollars and leave.
---
That ring would just as equally go to a bear in loot council guilds too and no one would complain.
---
Hey cheers! I appreciate the honesty and devotion to leading people out of the dark when it comes to understanding manipulation of online games. Only question I have for you is was it fun?
---
Well that’s because classic is still in it’s infancy stage.  We still haven’t hit the PvE/PvP wall. Where you have a bunch of PvPers unable to rank beyond 10 and PvEers hitting the tactic and gear fights. But hopefully this will come with BWL valatraza.
---
tier 0 / tier 0.5 is technically dungeon set 1 / dungeon set 2. 
---
And yes the 35 energy proc from 4 set bonus is extremely powerful, people end up with Naxx/AQ40 gear, and 4 piece of darkmantle is used in final BiS, yes. Not shadowcraft though.
---
You’d be surprised at how many warlocks I fight in AV that don’t sac
---
Eh strongly disagree.
---
Mageblade is a myth
---
sToNks
---
Make a horde on Zandalar Tribe. Very good balance, don't be afraid of it being rp.
---
Tbh premade groups will utilize the ban list and will either get you silenced or get you constantly pinged for afk..it's all fun and games until you have a deserter buff or can't talk
---
Nah its just noone wants to here abt an entitled mage. Yall charge group mates for water/food and even ports.  Finding any mage who can sheep a mob and cast nova and a couple aoe spells is not difficult at all
---
&gt; It doesn't matter that they've been mass reported, blizz needs to be stealthy and find out their insane coding methods and surprise them.
---
The AV botters are not using insane code, their using toddler level code since the only thing they need to do is queue, accept, leave BGs, and do literally anything that keeps them from going afk.
---
Do mages even play the same game as the rest of us? I'm sure you are playing your class optimally, but holy shit I die to one elite my level and you are able to farm them en mass.
---
am I the only one who’s with the “wow. We don’t care” guy?!
---
What dungeons are "need" dungeons for quests/ drops after lvl 45?
---
Its 100% inaccurate. It only takes in raid stats
---
And the worst part of all of this, BLIZZARD WONT DO ANYTHING
---
This game has turned into a breeding ground for assholes, and blizzard doesn't really care. 
---
Here is a small list of things that blizzard will not ban for  
---
Cross Faction Collusion ✓  
---
24/7 griefing cities (as in camp the city and kill all NPCs endlessly till the server de-pops) ✓  
---
AH Botting ✓  
---
Bot Farming ✓  
---
False Reporting ✓  
---
Mass False Reporting ✓  
---
Encouraging others to false report ✓  
---
Harassing other players ✓  
---
Not a single thing listed here is acceptable, but these are things that are rampant in the game and it appears that blizzard does not care about it.
---
But it’s not illegal. Its just against the game’s rules. It doesn’t really have an equivalent in real lawbreaking because this is completely victimless unlike maybe drug dealing which I assume is what you’re implicitly comparing it to.
---
Drug dealers are bad people and drug addicts are just trying to get high because they have a problem.
---
Botters and gold sellers aren’t like drug dealers just because “they both break rules.” They’re more like wage workers at McDonalds selling you shit you shouldn’t be eating but you want anyway. And then in this metaphor the McDonalds food also gives you superpowers.
---
why so serious?
---
Could you please tell me what are the official AV Premade Xrealm Discords? I’m a horde looking to farm honor in a more efficient way (currently rank 6 and suffering a lot due to work/family/life), so I would love that. Thank you.
---
I agree with NAFTM2069, sports are comparable. People can have expectation for themselves, you can even play a solo game like it is your life. I am part of those people having fun when you give it all. Reading further you actually agree with the part of playing seriously if you enjoy it...
---
However game aren't necessary made for "fun" or "enjoyment and entertainment" contrary to popular belief (source: I studied game design). Also, the notion of "enjoyment and entertainment" is blurry. A lot of people have fun at playing Dark soul, I don't mind a hard game, but Dark soul is also a punitive game, and I don't like that. Another example is horror game Dead space, I liked some part of it, but it is actually mostly very stressful for me.
---
So what are game made for, you may ask? For experience. Experience, the same thing you do in life. I could talk long on that.  
---
Wow can be quite similar to real life in many ways, can you be excused being an "asshole" in real life? You answer.  
---
As game designer, if you don't want some behavior in your game, you can adapt the game, typically you can do stuff against camping, like the kill cam in fps game, or the no honor target buff in wow, that is just a small insensitive to not camp a player or kill a lobby. Even so, if you make a multiplayer versus game with tchat, especially tchat between opposing player (like on LoL), you will get toxic behavior like you would get on real life.  
---
\&gt; Even though its their life, its *still*  just a game. Thats the thing, just because you decided to make it your  life doesnt change the fact that its a video game. Its laughable  
---
Sometime I got people saying "chill up, it is **just** a game**",** if they want to play to relax, they can, and I have the right to play the way I like it too.  If there people want to spend 3hours in a dungeon because they take pulling not seriously and end up dying, I do not want to be part of it. If I am unable to play my best on Overwatch because my team is chilling because "it is just a game, relax", this get me angry, and I call it throwing.  
---
Imagine you have someone investing a lot of time into a game (skyrim/wow for example), and you delete his account/character, he get mad, and you tell him "it is just a game, why get mad?". Seriously, what the difference with real life stuff? In real life someone could love painting as a hobby, he could put 300hours into a painting, and someone could destroy it, would you also say "chill up, its just a painting". The "Its just a game" sentence is as toxic.
---
Imagine being the person who typed this and finding this post and it's comments
---
Once you buy it you can use it forever.
---
Whats so good in the ZG patch? New lock here
---
This is Classic lmao, you don't need to min max your character to clear content anymore. Let the Ret Paladin play his spec lol.
---
rogue's does
---
Lots of dungeons: shaman (no CD on rez)
---
Mostly questing: druid (regen mana while in cat form for low downtime)
---
While I leveled we oftne had a Grp with 2 Warlocks and 2 Healers, we just spammed Hellfire and got healed up. Worked fine. 
---
But Aggro is just something you have to deal with as Warlock. I always pull aggro in MC and I die at Ony from Aggro at least 50% of the time.
---
ZF for the carrot on a stick, and then BRD for any BIS. I will skip ST and Mara.
---
Nah all I kept was my snowman kit and an alt with snowballs.
---
You can make assumptions if you want but I never said I did any of that stuff, I'm just pointing out what is obviously going to happen in the situation. You can all make utopian arguments about people on the internet suddenly giving a shit about someone elses time but I'm just reminding you thats its completely unrealistic
---
Says the Whitemane Horde player...
---
What if there are two people with assist that are locked to different raid IDs?
---
I’ve never heard of it working this way.
---
I experimented with a bot in vanilla... with a warrior to level 30.
---
My bot/program utilized similar scripts that multiboxers use, with a predetermined path.
---
That account was never banned.
---
I’m not computer savvy enough to know if the game can detect a script being used.
---
But given the similarities of a bot to a multiboxxer I’ve never really understood why multi boxing is permitted, and if multiboxxers are adversely effected by means of shutting down bots, I think it is worth the loss.
---
5 imp wands 5 spirit tap. The rest is not important.
---
Sounds more like a complaint against enh shaman
---
Meanwhile our premade is rocking a 97% winrate. Why? Cause pugs can play a part in it. Be kind to them. Give simple instructions and a game plan. Got a 100% mount and want to help follow star and stack on star. Are you a lvl 51 and want to help, keep the horde busy in mid or choke points, help backcapping. Or if you want to farm harpies rams or whatever perfectly fine.
---
Good communication and a friendly funny chat with an overall positive attitude helps.
---
the game doesnt show hp of mobs. anything you see is an addon, which is an approximation at best.
---
Druids aren't a meme class in pvp. PVP is completely different from meme spec raiding culture
---
Only time I've been killed in open world since AV came out as Ally is when I'm fishing...
---
There may not be a 1:1 analogy to real life but you're gaining gold without working for it (or nearly as much). I don't see how that's any less shitty than people buying their services. They make the market of gold selling after all.
---
yeah you're an asshole
---
*bagpipes* All right Laddies, touch your dorf! We’ll be queuing in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Queue!
---
The game shows you hp in percentages, not actual values. You dealt enough damage to drop the mob from 50% to 10%. If that was 70 damage it means the mob had 175 total HP.
---
It’s good in moderation but it’s also bad if it’s overdone. Sounds like literally everything.
---
It's so op he had to cut out parts of the video, because the fights took too long.
---
naw the misanthrope streamer kiddies probably think thats cool. shame this community has become this way, I wish none of these twitch manchildren had ever hear of WoW. Fuck Asmongold
---
Fury warr already has a gigantic crit rate. Felstriker would obviously be good, what with how important crits are, but I think it’s already possible to cap with world buff and shit.
---
Actually an equivalent or even lesser amount of flat crit would probably result in significantly higher dps because of better flurry uptime. If CHT is better for rogues than Felstriker, it’d probably be a bigger upgrade for warriors.
---
Warlock has bigger threat issues than other dps and fewer options for how to deal with them.
---
It's not really possible for horde because of the queue times. If there is a resource for horde out there, which there may be, I don't know what it is.
---
Alliance queues en masse and sees how many people got in the same game. If not many did or it's a bad composition (ie no healers) then we drop queue and try again. Instant queues makes this possible. It's a blessing and a curse.
---
I assumed this was the case. I told my mage friend (who also gets attacked) that they probably kill a majority of players
---
The game doesn't tell you any HP values for anything in this game.
---
Addons just do their best to estimate.
---
False
---
will be able to test soon. Thank you!
---
Point on the doll where the shadow priest touched you
---
This is the weirdest example of game theory searching for its Nash Equilibrium.
---
the effect depends on the class
---
Dont hate birds, because they dont hate you! (Usually)
---
thank you!
---
Theres nothing wrong with taking a game that seriously even if the general population will thing your silly for doing so, as I said in a previous comment Ive done this myself with WoW for a time. The issue is when the behavior becomes destructive for other players experience. This post is a good example because this guy is being a dick in the BG chat for a full AV.
---
And im sorry to say even if you feel your entitled to your right to play the game as seriously as you would like, other players are entitled to view that as the "wrong" way to play even if there really is no wrong way to play. The small minority that makes WoW their life and treats casuals poorly while excluding them from anything that the hardcore players do are going to be disliked by the masses, thats just reality.
---
Thank you :) We'll probably go there. I've always been curious about RP realms tbh.
---
You’re playing a massive multiplayer role playing game. With millions of other people using one account/character. They play by one set of rules, and you think because you justified spending the money on extra subscriptions you should be able to partake in this experience with your own set of rules. GTFO
---
It's either that, or one of these warrior tanks that basically never uses Charge for some insane reason. They slowly range pull everything and are constantly rage-starved and have zero threat. Don't get me wrong, range-pulling has it's place to avoid pats, etc. but is not necessary 90% of the time especially in leveling dungeons.
---
To be honest I had deleted my old attempt and just re wrote one I had not tried in game yet. The one posted here exceeded the character limit, though.
---
Joke is going over peoples heads and I'm in a guild thanks.
---
Did this exact scenario. 
---
 level a healer AND alt of your preference. when you get your co-op groove going, and (if) when she learns about pots/first aid/food/agro, you can move on from healing since shell be self sustaining and you have your main class.  
---
Just one persons experience though, since I prefer a warlock.
---
heh i remember back in vanilla i was a mage that held out for the mageblade. think it took several months and then i had to dump all of my saved up DKP to win it. was quite the night lol.  rarely did bids get that ridiculously competitive with my old group.
---
That's fine, see you after the divorce!
---
Supposedly Felheart Gloves have a 30% drop rate. I find that incredibly hard to believe.
---
I blame both. Blizzard is always fucking things up, which is why we wanted #nochanges (of course they didn't listen to that completely). That said, it doesn't absolve people of their shitty behavior. Show some level of intelligence and restrain yourself; it's not hard. But, no, you'd rather ruin your future just for some imaginary points and a title in the short term.
---
Blizzard shouldn't have allowed it, but the dominant factions didn't need to abuse it. But we all know the kind of people that PvPers are, which means this never could have been prevented.
---
Thanks for the optimism that she'll ever say yes 🤣
---
F. be a tank and get oofed on
---
I'm a holy priest in alt raid that has 32-35 guild members and we fill the rest with pugs so we open roll +1 reset at domo.
---
In 8 MC's:
---
Only had 2 eyes drop and both have gone to pug priests
---
No T2 priest pants from Rag
---
0 bracer drops
---
1 Cauterizing band that went to a regular priest who has since quit playing
---
o/
---
So I guess one important thing is which order if things you want to take precedence. I’m guessing mouseover &gt; target and adjust based on friendly or not. This should do that for you: 
---
    /cast [mod:alt,@mouseover,harm] Shadow Word: Pain(Rank 1); [mod:alt,@mouseover,help] Flash Heal(Rank 4);[@mouseover,harm] Shadow Word: Pain;[@mouseover,help]Flash Heal;[harm]Shadow Word: Pain; Flash Heal
---
I think this is written as simply as possible. I have removed the nodead checks because I personally don’t like them. I don’t want my buttons to fall through into another target/mouseover if my current is dead. I will properly target/mouseover what I want. You can add them back in if you want them.
---
Blizzard allowing both free and paid transfers so early into Classic, failing to lock faction populations given that they’ve created massively overpopulated realms compared to retail vanilla levels.
---
All so they could save/make a quick buck on server infrastructure and transfers at the expense of the game.
---
Why is he in your spawn? Lokholar camps DB, shouldnt tree spirit do the same?
---
It’s not a party without beer pong
---
honestly man i was an unorganized 15-16 year old, so not really. It was a significant amount. When I stopped I sold off all my contacts and promised to get out of the market for like $2k to another botter.
---
Sounds like the Terminator. Ill be back
---
it suspends your threat but it comes back after the duration right?
---
The drop to the bottom, but are still leagues ahead of any of the meme specs in Naxx.
---
Understood. Check out my second reply and see if that provides what you’re looking for.
---
If I bothered with doing a premade instead of pug it better fucking have a good winrate.  That said I am a lazy man and will take my more often than not loss in the pugs.
---
Band of accuria is not good for a fury warrior. It should be priod to main tanks -&gt; rogues/hunters. Fury warriors need don julios + Quickstrike ring bc 6% is so easy to achieve from other pieces
---
Playing a Druid 
---
Been doing Mc and Ony for 14 weeks, haven’t seen the t2 pants or t2 head once.
---
Yesterday I got them both :)
---
Understandable, have a nice day
---
Lol what’s the name.
---
Nightshift;)
---
nonsense
---
i distinctly remember simultaneously being unable to queue AB while i queued cross realm AV 
---
i also distinctly remember horde having 20x longer queues than alliance because blizzard also botched realm transfers in 2005
---
lets not forget the time we had talent trees from the future with raid balance from the past mixed together
---
What in this post makes you assume he is saying he is right about everything lol stop projecting 
---
You big mad
---
I had to open a ticket to get logged out manually by a gm.

Need it for Av
---
Sure we can. I mean, I'm a **huge** fan of TBC, much more so than Vanilla, but flying mounts kinda sucked. 
---
Outlands is great from 58-69 but it's pretty crap at 70. The world outside of Shat feels so small. You basically only flew from Shat to dungeons, raids, farming spots, etc. and rarely ever had a reason to bump into other people.
---
Outside of Sunwell Isle, it basically reduced PvP on PvP servers to the absolute minimum. If you couldn't beat someone, you simply CCed them, ran, and mounted up behind a tree and flew off. Or if you saw someone coming for you and you didn't want to fight, you could easily mount up and bounce. 
---
Imo, its convenient but it reduces player interaction, which is never a good thing.
---
We have like 9 Mageblades, drops almost every week. 
---
I haven't seen an Bonereaver's edge or Quick Strike Ring once. No legendaries either.
---
1 Spinal, 1 Onslaught, 1 Leaf.
---
Not really play wc3.  The Horde come off as the scrappy underdog heroes just trying to establish themselves away from the alliance.
---
Death coil is op.
---
I’m always anticipating the boss fights cuz they last longer and allow me to really ramp up my dps and damage done meters. Eat boss’ up! Nom nom! Also I was recently listening to a wow YouTube/twitch personality and he was discussing how he’ll throw in a shadow burn or a death coil if the mob is towards the end of its life to boost even more dps out of the fight. That’s not bad. Extra 500-700 reg damn or over 1k damn if it crits! Sooo good!
---
Honestly someone else being able to buy their epic mount or buy crafting mats for a 300 skill or buy their crafted pre-raid bis item isn’t really going to effect you that much.
---
Your pixels don’t have any real value outside the sentimental context of the game, and your time spent playing is just time spent losing money.
---
You could buy all the stuff you want with mommy’s credit card, but if you’re bad you’re still gonna be bad.
---
Realistically though, I don’t think about these people at all because I’m not part of the gold selling/buying system and it doesn’t affect my experience in the game. Most players are just gonna log in, go on the AH, buy the stuff they want, and then log out and go to work. Ultimately you wouldn’t even know about this type of thing happening unless someone was angrily pointing it out to you on Reddit. 
---
Not to mention the fact that efficient player behavior for farming trade goods emulates bot behavior (efficient farming routes, repetitive mechanical activity, avoiding player interaction), so it’s not entirely distinct which makes it hard to tell the difference to a casual observer. That coupled with the fact that OP mentioned he set his bot to help players do group quests in Felwood and they said he was very friendly and helpful. Not really something that changes the way the majority of the population play.
---
I think environment play a part into using  game as a substitute for achieving a real fulfilling life. Just a quick example, the cost of studying in the US. There is a lot to say about school too, go see Alfie Khon books or Celine Alvarez (fr) if you are interested in the subject. Also, while I agree most people would not chase rank 14 if they had a more fulfilling life, I do think it would be possible for someone to have fun doing that, how players get "fun" at playing a game, is not the same for everyone (see 4 types of player: Achiver, Killer, Socializer, Explorer).  
---
Game aren't necessary made for "fun" (source: I have studied game design).  A game is an experience, the same as real life is. I would be curious to know if you would said "It’s supposed to just be something stupid we spend some of our free time on." about real life too. You either insulting life by saying it is stupid, or insulting games and game designer by saying it is just here for "fun".
---
Even if you didn't personally participate I gaurantee horde flightpaths were hellcamped just as bad as alliance once before BGs hit.  It's not a horde a thing it's a honor ranking neckbeard thing.
---
Def gonna check when I get home from work. Will post update
---
1. The ring is pretty garbage.
---
2. The neck is absolutely busted.
---
That's why.
---
Awesome? Lol
---
I am thinking about transferring my 60 human mage from Skeram to Incendius.  How is Incendius for balance? As well as how active it is?
---
Yes, this is normal.
---
To each their own but Seal Fate is far more entertaining to play.  There are times in MC where I'll get chains of crit backstabs/evisc and I'll be at the top of the DPS meter by a large margin.  Other times I'll be much lower.  It all depends on getting those crits, which makes it that much more exciting when you see them.  Seems like you could really take advantage of Felstriker this way.
---
Shut up and queue doesn't have ridiculous rank requirements (as if rank equates to skill in vanilla) and I haven't lost a single game.
---
I guess it just depends on how you write the script then.
---
You are fully missing the point of my posts.  I'm trying to reconcile why my memories of always losing AV to the Alliance from vanilla to WOTLK and now where I'm honored and have around a 50% or better ratio in classic.
---
If Alliance is more likely to win in the past, why is it more even now?  My assertion is that because the alliance is more fractured and possibly pulling all skill from pugs, so the horde is getting softballs outside of pre-mades.
---
Yellow?! Mind blown.
---
\**doubt**
---
It's mostly because this sub is trash
---
If they have the same amount of hpm you are sort of undergeared.
---
Of course man what could go wrong?
---
They won't mad alliance pugger cant join a premade discord lol
---
&gt; it has 0% effect on PVE elements of the game
---
Stopped reading riiiiight about at this point
---
Branch away from LW as a whole. It's a bad profession for gold making.
---
You should definitely be using perd over thrash blade in your mh and mirah's will be a better offhand than thrash blade.
---
I’m using fun as a synonym for entertainment. Games, like fiction books, movies, music, etc are all for entertainment. Anything else you get from them is a side benefit. I am just here for entertainment and to unwind from my other obligations. 
---
There is a wealth of information on the internet, that can be accessed on the same computer it takes to play WoW. One could get a job, self study, join a training program, socialize, etc. there are a million more productive ways to use ones time. I didn’t just mean going to school. Sure playing games is an experience, and I like them, but it should be at the bottom of ones priorities. Family &gt; Work &gt; Hobbies. 
---
Ranking requires sacrificing all other opportunities to devote ones entire life to this game. They give up their chance of ever fixing their depressing existence if they’re already in one, or risk losing what they have now if not.
---
To inspect something that closely I think would take another human. All you have to do is add enough variation in a hotkey script to avoid some sort of ai from seeing a pattern. I dont cheat, I dont even play retail much, just wondering how simple this could actually be.
---
Shaman 100% for Windfury.
---
Nothing will ever tickle a warrior's fancy more than WF.
---
&gt; most high lvl zones are full of horde gankers waiting in queues, and they KOS every alliance they see
---
So little of "a rocket since," in fact, that it was stated in the OP...
---
This post is calling for people who **do not** care about PvP to start KoS while they're out questing instead of remaining passive.
---
mages are making ME generate rage hahahah.... I swear they're all on meth
---
Good fury warriors know that swapping to BRE for cleave fightsand swapping back to dual wield for single target will achieve top parses
---
anything is possible
---
I did 4 runs tonight. No issues with aggro, and 3 blues in chest.
---
I used to love the banish maneuver when people were being asshats farming demons in Azshara back in vanilla.  It’s the ultimate grief because if they just ignore it and move on, they run the risk of getting overwhelmed when banish finishes, but it lasts for several seconds (wasn’t it like 30?) so it’s annoying as hell to wait to finish.
---
or some weird phasing bullshit lol
---
I don't like to reserve stuff and I'm not complaining.
---
Gross... I never wanna play with this person
---
Mage /thread
---
Another local gets overly defensive over nothing and starts strawmanning anyone who disagrees with him.
---
Damn. Happy to hear it. Will do more runs after new years and hope it was some kind of fluke.
---
&gt;Plus having more bots doesn’t change the spawn limits.
---
It just changes who they're more likely to go to...
---
I believe that it's not against the ToS but I do not believe that you've read it.
---
5 piece makes no difference, I have it and never get linked pulls. The only thing that causes linked pulls is pulling boss with pet damage
---
I am unsure,  worth testing but not my raid lockout
---
I’d rather sit on the toilet all day
---
I mean they quite literally murder farmers for quests and ally themselves with cannibalistic undead hell bent on ending humankind. 
---
So idk, I'd say they're pretty evil.
---
ended up just waiting and i got logged out somehow
---
I think most are
---
Raiding since Early October, haven't seen a single Band of Accuria.
---
You can get 2 blues+ the pattern but that’s the way it’s always been
---
Stalagg. Epic PvE server.
---
if you have wolf he can pull aggro with howl
---
Oh yeah, i know. But this isnt a pvp montage video? Seems like it was facetious to begin with. But ppl found a way to criticize the guy over something unrelated to the subject of the video. Seems kinda douchy to me.
---
As someone who's Alliance on Stalagg but still hasn't hit 60... It's likely because our server has been a total shitshow since launch.
---
~3:1 Horde:Alliance ratio, with lots of the more active players jumping ship during the free transfers. So more or less the only people left are the extremely patient - who are probably like me and haven't even hit level cap yet - or the extremely angry/bitter.
---
I use owl with screech off
---
Talking with my guild member he never had lead at any point. I thought maybe the lead logged out when he got buffs and possibly passed lead to him but he said it didnt happen. I am unsure until its tested again
---
He did have assist tho
---
Yeah, we've seen private servers that have been more well done than classic die quicker. I would not be surprised if classic dies in the next couple phases. I am happy for what we have on one hand. This is the best mmo in years, but it's also so badly managed with the cancerous nochanges mentality that I dont believe the game has any future as much as I want it to. 
---
Action needs to happen. People will not stick around for another few phases as the nostalgia trip begins to end and something else grabs attention.
---
Can't win without using a broken holiday-specific mechanic LMAO no-shoes at it again
---
How do I get an AV bot?
---
Sorry Stacy we only want your mom, she's got it goin on
---
Even then the problem is PVE already heavily favored alliance while PVP are mostly horde. 
---
Rebalance the racials somehow? Wotf 5 min, orc stun 10%?
---
r/iamverybadass
---
One of my accounts got just got banned for automation...
---
Unfortunately I was literally having that account just follow my 46 hunter through wailing caverns and RFC.  I know I was reported when gathering the quests  (I don't know many bots that are worried about doing all the quests in WC).  I also have to wonder how they thought to ban 1 out of 5 accounts.... after careful consideration of course.
---
When did you craft the robe?
---
I can see them add it in the future, and I do not mind. Not like it is gonna change the game in any format, so why not.
---
Prat. Anytime someone says invite or inv it turns the word green and becomes a clickable link. You should be able to change the key words
---
I'm too huntarded to solo DM / Mara...
---
Like most reddit communities, people have a tendency to *majorly* overestimate how much of the player base follows any of this stuff. It’s why it’s never a good idea to get your take of a game (or community) based solely off a subreddit.
---
I don’t PVP at all if that helps the matter.
---
It's super easy to fuck over an aoe frost mage. When I played mine I was always super polite because it would take next to no effort for someone to ruin my day.
---
It's pretty, but lackluster.
---
&gt;Yeah, we've seen private servers that have been more well done than classic die quicker.
---
Most of them were pretty steady until AQ at least, and obv the classic announcement also hurt a lot of them.
---
My guild runs DKP system with a splash of common sense / loot council as far as what *classes* (not players) can get what items.
---
Works pretty well.
---
i would love to see this added
---
No the mage is in no way required to share exp. Try and snipe his mobs or w/e but don't get mad if someone doesn't want to party with you. They're in no way obligated. The first person to be a "dickhead" was the /spitter
---
Holy shit is that what was up there? I was trying to max camera and everything to figure out what the fuck was there. Nice job
---
yeap thats me if only I didnt work full time now that would still be me.
---
Yeah the trinket is a big mistake as a tank.
---
More buffs for despell protection
---
What is the macro command to cancel maul?
---
Do you have a source on them stopping the use of Warden? I'm curious because I thought they still did.
---
For communicating outside of the game in real time for the purpose of circumventing playing the game as intended (not grouping for AV)
---
Should prio it to the guild LW first or enjoy pissing away thousands of gold to buy everyone an Onxyia Cloak for BWL.
---
It is horde's fault though - there's a whole... what 1 maybe 2 ally servers?  Horde players kinda look stupid here.
---
You say it’s evident, but how is that so? Is it any different from someone watching Netflix on another screen and moving every minute or so?
---
Being bad at the game is not a bannable offence.
---
I definitely remember people racing AV when 1.12 came out.
---
When [tools like this exist](https://github.com/EinBaum/FakeChat), you can't trust that. Not to mention altering images is trivial.
---
Fucking same
---
If its not illegal, why thought police people?
---
lmao i saw that OP

What's the fishing requirement for fishing in av?
---
Nochanges philosophy was good when it accounts for not changing the spirit of what vanilla was, but it's completely idiotic when its regarding parts of the game that need to be adaptable to the highly dynamic gaming environment that classic is
---
Horde have a premade discord. They don’t get as many people in per game but it is there. There’s another thread on it in this very sub today.
---
Run 127. Haven’t even seen it drop yet
---
Discussion
---
&gt;2) They were inferior even to gear from 20 man sets
---
Not for rogues. In fact, rogues will be replacing their T2 gear with 0.5 sets for that 6 set bonus
---
Spirit is literally useless to you
---
Actually warden can access the file name of any process you have open. It scans files you don't have open too.
---
Bigglesworth... lol.. 1 week on that server and he'll be complaining there to.
---
Which region / time zone?
---
Ah I see, thanks for your answer mate!
---
They like to brag about all the +defense they have till you realize they miss like crazy because they only have 1% hit and are using the ony trinket.
---
Thanks. I'm eu too and ill try tomorrow aswel and see if i get the same result.
---
I'm currently mountain time, but will most likely be back in central time by the end of 2020.
---
I once ruined a pull of a troll mage by pulling a ranged mob to his pack. He died. It felt super good because I play on PVE realm, but I was PVP at hearth in the past.
---
Good point. It's ridiculous that people actually do this kind of thing.
---
really?? wow that sucks...😅
---
It doesn't have to be a "fair" fight, but both factions needs to have about the same manpower so that one faction can't dominate certain zones 24/7 and camp literally every flightpath.
---
It didn't happen on private servers, since they were always very close to equal, while on classic its just a joke.
---
We are back to 40 min BRM runs.
---
I think the people who are still playing are the people who love #nochanges. I also think that if you open up the can of worms of making changes, nobody would agree on which change to make. I think changes would upset the remaining players more than it would re-attract the players who left.   
---
If I were making the decision, I would stay the course.
---
I made 15 g this run and it took me 20 mins so this is a 45g/hr gold farm!! I even got bad rng!!
---
\&gt;  Farmers can absolutely hog quest mobs with no regard to anyone else who needs it. Dude was nice about asking to get a few tags in and the farmer was a dickhead. 
---
That's not the case read. OP didn't ask for tags he invited the guy and the guy declined the invite after his whisper.
---
He legit just declined invite and got a /spit in return.
---

---
The caster ring is terrible. Hunters should be allowed to roll after melee get what they need. Your guild is correct.
---
Mountain Tome player here. We have quite a few active guilds for our time zone on Bigglesworth. Horde is the majority, but it isn’t terribly over populated.
---
Currently the only servers are Pacific time and Eastern time, so I guess it depends on if you prefer playing later or earlier if you plan on raiding or generally being online  during primetime
---
To be fair, even though they are in an instance they can effect the economy. Not taking a side, just not as simple as you make it.
---
They aren’t going to do anything to balance factions. They messed that chance up when they opened the free server transfers. They corrected that mistake by offering paid server transfers. There is just no way to “balance” population on imbalanced servers right now.
---
Raid gear goes to raiders.
---
Good to know, thanks for the heads up.
---
My guess would be:
---
/cast Maul
---
Hit it once to queue maul; hit it again to cancel maul.
---
Did I sound like I didn’t know the difference?
---
I’ve used both. The scripts to make them work are pretty much identical.
---
The difference is the input.
---
&gt;Having .5 for BWL seems like a no brainer. 
---
It would mean rogues basically skip BWL as it obsoletes the tier set.
---
This is not true at all. It's almost too hard to find groups for quests as it is.
---
I mean if you are in this position how can you fault these transfers... as alliance and cross BG's, you know the queue times will still be nothing and you will not be ganked 10 times going to an instance. Sure you lost out on the pre-BG honor farming but it also makes the game more enjoyable too. 
---
Just because people roll a PVP server doesn't mean they enjoy getting ganked outnumbered 5+ to 1, over and over again.
---
Hey all!
---
Started playing WOW classic (first time playing any wow game) at launch and had a blast with it levelling to around level 48 on my orc warrior on the EU Mirage Raceway server. Unfortunately I had to quit just before Phase 2 came out due to real life commitments but I'm back now and wondering if it is worth getting back into classic?
---
Was looking around on this sub and from the happy place it once was it seems to have fell into a total shitstorm, people are talking about dead servers a lot too on here and in general it makes me worry if people are still playing the game and if they are are they even still enjoying it?
---
I mean I'll have to find a new guild and stuff willing to take on a noob and eventually teach me how to raid but I'm cool with putting in that effort. Just wondering about the health of the game and all the negativity around?
---
Ehhh. I'd argue it has its uses. It is good for a long time for mitigation. I got the neck tho.
---
Alliance is instant-queue, and AV is the best fishing spot anywhere near IF.
---
For alliance, AV is essentially a fishing spot inside their major cities. I go to AV to fish for nightfin because I  can get there in a minute flat without ever leaving IF. Honor and rep are just things that happen while I fish.
---
Vis'khag, Deathbringer, bonereaver's edge, t1 mage bracers, eye of sulfuras, second binding
---
Our DM buff group is not the same as our raid group. Everyone drops after buffs and gets invited by g back.
---
It is beyond trivial to write a script that has a random delay that looks legit. Need to hit a space at every 5 minutes? Pick a random millisecond between 4-5 minutes and wait for that, done.
---
Of course there’s no shortage of people who won’t do that because they’re not that bright, but it makes proving that someone is botting vs just being lazy very difficult. There’s no rule saying people have to try, just be present.
---
I always /w Ting, he's a mage who spam /Y very often. Has every enchant in game, and a cool dude aswell. Gave me 5g discount on my 4+ stats for doing some erotic role-play.
---
Appreciate it.  I'll definitely keep it in mind.
---
You know who doesn't care? Attractive women.
---
Why?
---
Huh
---
Go tip to tip
---
He’s just another pug trying to trick people into going hard
---
Extremely simple. Scripting is a big part of my job but trust me when I say it’s very basic level stuff. If you can call a function and write a loop that’s all you need, literal programming 101 day 1 stuff.
---
Also a gnome warrior tank. How do you feel about Maladath, runed blade of the black flight? I've been thinking about asking my guild to give me priority on it once BWL lands. Another option would be Core Hound Tooth, but we haven't seen one in our raid yet.
---
I could afford to get edgemaster's with some time, but do you feel its still worth it despite the loss of stats and armor?
---
I'm currently OT'ing with Eskhander's right claw and threat hasn't been an issue. But Edgemaster's doesn't give unarmed skill, so I would have to find another weapon if I went that route. I still have my Mirah's song and an annihilator, so some decent options, but both only have 40 dps.  I have 5% hit with full tier gear, and 9% if I swap to lionheart, brigam girdle, and battleborn ambraces, but I definitely feel a drop in my durability when I do this.
---
With BWL coming so soon, I'm not sure if Foror's is worth it to pick up. We're 10/10 in MC, so I'm really looking at prepping myself for the next phase.
---
Heres a couple links to my gear, above is mitigation set, below is threat.

Like week 4 or something of WoW classic this happened. Our raid was mad AF and it was a Wednesday and blizzard never responded. Damn guild leader rofl we now invite via bank alts
---
I wonder if there is the same thing on top of Balinda's.
---
Every time there is a BG wide announcement I see a quote box coming from Balinda's if I am near it.
---
It's not though. 
---
You all knew this going in and you encouraged shitty behavior.
---
Of course, I can think of the Dire Maul farmers on Nostalrius for that
---
If you want to take it and go to the bottom of the list for spell power ring, by all means.
---
Maybe it’s just a busted de-spawn?
---
We're moving in to a phase where people are starting to see the design flaws of Vanilla that Blizzard tried to address in later expansions - the plateau where once you get your dungeon gear at 60, the only remaining way to progress in the game is to start scheduled 40-person raids. And how new content releases were mainly targeted at players who had already geared up on existing 40-person raid content. 
---
As Blizzard started to address these problems in later expansions, they lost something along the way. There is a pleasure and a social aspect to teaming up for obtuse, difficult quests, making long journeys to dungeon entrances, and opening trade windows for mana water. This social aspect is just completely lost in modern retail WoW. And raiding feels less rewarding when your hard-earned gear just becomes completely useless every 3-6 months. The pendulum of accessibility and designing towards easy content has swung way too far in the other direction in retail, and the modern retail subscriber numbers definitely indicate that the retail design team have lost their way. 
---
 I'm hoping that the design team can bring back some of the baseline challenge, gear advantage, and social aspects of Classic in the next retail expansion, while also keeping the parts that make retail a more fun experience for non-raiders.
---
&gt; Did the spawn rates for gathering items increase enough to match the vast populations? 
---
They did for devilsaurs, but I think that was mostly to stop getting complaints about cross faction collusion.
---
They are clearly willing to make changes when it reduces work for them.
---
What aren't you sure of? That they still are jumping through hoops non-dead servers wont' have to?
---
Transferring servers or smuggling materials to alt accounts are both hurdles/hoops non-dead servers don't deal with it doesn't matter which one they choose to do.
---
Warning: I'm full of shit and botted now my account is banned
---
Don't be the guy that is winning all the AVs and farming people for honour?  The only jerk part is that he's explaining his system.
---
Ban/invite is just a term for his filtering.  Ban just means "filtered out"
---
Not that I don't believe you because there are a lot in Hinterlands, but how do you know - have you watched them all? Whispering them doesn't mean anything as they could be afk / not wanting to reply.
---
There’s a difference. If you want to be intentionally too obtuse to understand that, so be it. If they wanted to allow premades, they would have allowed everyone to queue as such. 
---
In its current state, you have one faction who has the ability to obtain an unfair competitive advantage via external programs.
---
Here's how you fix it: More alliance should play AV. That way more Horde will be stuck inside instanced content = everybody wins.
---
^ might contain sarcasm
---
This guy fucks!
---
Seconding this..my 4 friends and I quit when we realized alliance couldn't fight back on stalagg. 2 of us wanted to but ultimately burned out rerolling since our mains had almost full raid gear by then..
---
I mean, if they enjoy pvp as it is now I guess.
---
If by fuckwit you mean someone making a tonne of gold selling ports then its fantastic thanks. :)
---
t0.5 is shadowcraft, yes.
---
the 4pc bonus is the same one as the 6pc on shadowcraft. its just so insanely good cuz u only need 4 instead of 6 pieces
---
I logged onto my account, sold a few items too quickly with Auctionator, logged off and was hit with a ban screen immediately.
---
What do you need gold for?
---
Raids don't require consumables.
---
I fucking died at "scout for new talent". Your playing a video game bro, chill out.
---
As someone who is about to finally get Classic I sincerely hope people don't leave now.  I originally started playing January 2005, and to this day it is still one of the most fun games I ever played.
---
50 AVs per day, 12 minute games. That's 10 hours of AV each day, plus queue times plus "periodically joining pugs". Man I miss living with my mom.
---
Don't go to AV wearing cloth. Wear your t1. Embrace the banana.
---
&gt;#nochanges
---
There have been plenty of chances.  Classic is not vanilla.  The nostalgia is there and the game play is mostly the same, but the way people play it now is totally different.  And really, the nostalgia exist mostly in the leveling experience.  The level 60 experience is its own thing isn't reminiscent of vanilla in any way shape.
---
The players have already brought the changes... so if they are interested in making classic into a long term investment, then it should be open season to tweaks whatever is necessary once everything is released.  There are a plephoha of changes I would welcome right now, but won't happen until a few months after naxx if anything.
---
The only weapon from rag my guild has seen is an Eye, we have been killing rag since week 3...  Also just got our first QSR this past week.  11 brutality blades, 2 viskag and 2 deathbringers though.
---
I'm just trying to let everyone know, to help them. 
---
Why is everyone is so quickly to point fingers. I've never bottled in any game.
---
Haha you're and idiot and got caught botting. Go cry elsewhere.
---
I used auctionator, have done years. It's not getting me banned. You either botted or got a lot of people reporting you.
---
Mageblade as well. Infact almost all drops, as I've only seen 2 drops and I will still need 7 items. Classic's loot is brutal, it seems the 2-3 drops per boss really leaves few room for people to get the loot they want. Some loot gets vendored (Vendorstrike anyone?) while I as a holy paladin have to compete with 8 mages, 4 paladins, a warlock and the occasional druid IF an item DOES drop.
---
Aurastone. We haven't had a single one drop so far. But you bet your ass we get that fucking dagger every single week.
---
No, I didn't bot. Just sold items too quickly with Auctionator as soon as I logged in.
---
And 5 minute Escape artist ^^
---
My apologies if I sounded condescending.
---
But to elaborate, that's not at all what my bot did. It did not repeat keystrokes. It made decisions on its own. It knew to pot/bandage. It knew how to deviate from its path. It knew how to farm, etc. It ate and drank at predetermined thresholds.. it wasn't mimicking anything.
---
You see it’s a multi level problem. They can’t ban people just cause they got reported a lot, that’s very abusable. So they need to have someone actually check and verify that the reported person was doing something wrong. Since something like that can’t be automated, they won’t ban them cause they don’t have enough staff in the first place. Remember the layoffs blizz did ahwhile back? These are the people that got fired to save them money lol, I’m pretty sure they want to spend as little money as possible on classic as well...
---
Honor awarded from kills vary depending on a lot of factors. Chances are, you're earning less per kill on average this week than you did last. 
---
Due to the group environment, you really don't get a lot of honor from kills in AV. People severely overestimate how much honor they should be getting. It doesn't help that the game doesn't even show honor based on diminishing returns whenever you get a kill.
---
I think it flagged because I sold items too quickly as soon as I logged in. So try not to do the same and you'll be good.
---
I've heard it happens if you buy out items too fast too.
---
Any warrior wpns of any kind since week 5
---
Something running in the addons directory only has access to the hooks provide by the games LUA, if the add-on was causing issues (see honorspy a patch a go) Blizzard will remove the hook.
---
To trigger the bot protection you need to be playing in the memory space,  so you botted.
---
God.  You fucking people. Just play as intended for God's sake.
---
How are you deducing they are bots from that picture lol?
---
Ten Storms is a blast. Really fun server.
---
So they aren't the same efficiency, got it. If they were, you'd only have 250 healing was my point.
---
I'm trying to warn people to help everyone, why is everyone so quickly to blame me. 
---
My gosh... lol.... that’s a load of people!
---
&gt;“Rebalance the racials somehow? Wotf 5 min, orc stun 10%?”
---
No ty. You can go play retail if you want a “balanced” game.
---
Ledditors are big noobs, Most of them are still not 60
---
Good, you hunters have been making too much gold anyway
---
Top end aint shit all about top DPS for weapon
---
Well, I think we did priority for the tanks but those were 4-5 poeple. After that it was for all because to be honest we never had any dps problems with molten core even from the first try. Everybody should have loot and be happy. I think after and during BWL it is another thing as raids are gonna be harder but outside gearing tanks 1 dps shouldn't be prioritazied over another.
---
The fast games for alliance always get 3-4K honor becuase you kill the all the lieutenants. The turtles give roughly the same honor but take ~3-6x longer
---
Because the addon isn't doing anything to get you banned. It has been around years and can't physically do anything to bot because it uses the API blizzard provides. It's an addon.
---
You've done something else to get banned. The time you get banned has nothing to do with when the thing you did happened. You could have used a bot 2 months ago and it's only just banned you.
---
He wasnt locked to a pug raid, it was an officer in the guild that had something come up due to the holidays so he was going to log out @ MC and instead of outside he logged inside.   
---
the person with the locked raid ID never zoned in
---
that really sucks! sorry to hear that
---
Yeah, Solo is the company that makes those, and are super cheap and found in just about every store that sells party stuff, food, alcohol, etc. Lots of people (myself included) bought a bag of like 500 for $20 and whenever I have a bunch of guests over I just pull them out since cleaning up the next day is super easy.
---
Play as "intended" in a 15 year old game in which most concepts have been scrapped because they weren't working as intended?
---
Ony Cloak's are useful for BWL, nearly required. Not sure why it would cost thousands of gold but it should go to a LW reasonably early.
---
Yeah you guys learned early on, now i know!
---
Anyone can do it with a simple google. Anyone with a very basic understanding in programming (which is really intuitive so not hard to learn) can do it in 5 seconds without google.
---
You make an infinite loop that jumps and then waits for a random number between say 32 and 102 seconds, and then jumps again and waits again etc...
---
I'm not sure how that looks inhuman when inspected closely, but it could be said that a human would be very unlikely to be *this* perfectly random. If you're chasing perfection, I suppose it'll have to be a bit more intricate in the random number logic. Maybe, pick a random number between 90 and 120, sometimes, randomly (20% chance) repeat the keystroke two times within .2 to 1 seconds, sometimes (5% chance) completely skip a keystroke, another time (5% chance) change the range to 20-50, that kind of thing.
---
Processed meat, I’m really not interested in your mommy issues, but I’ll reply to your comment because I’ll have the last word and finally put your online outburst to rest.
---
Meh it is the same as not giving a melee ranged wep to a hunter. Hunters will get a better wep when the bow or whatever will be used for a long time by the melee.
---
Pretty sure they don’t actually want bots in their game is possible... but anyway they won’t spend money to have real people check this kind of thing
---
