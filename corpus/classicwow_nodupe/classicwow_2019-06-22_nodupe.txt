No, its just fashionable to be unhappy, and there isn't much else to naysay in how Classic's coming out.

lol, bye
---
And the whole new rant about not being able to speak English in 2k19. As an educated middle class European. Who consumes 14 hours a day of Classic Wow Content in English.
---
My dumb ass played it super casually (played way too much hots Wed+Thurs nights) and never even got out of Darkshore until the server shutdown messages were running. I missed out on major city shenanigans with devs + streamers and in hindsight was like "FUCK why didn't I leave Darkshore earlier??" But hey I didn't leave because I was having fun. I never leveled NE really so it was mostly newish to me.
---
I mean in reality that's because 50% of them aren't actually proper words but made up nonsense, portmanteaus, or a compounds of two actual words which could be translated into Danish easily since we're quite fond of making compound words ourselves. Also some of them are just latin words like pyro which we have also borrowed.
---
Technically we do also share some words between the two languages because of some contamination back when Dane's took over half of Britain twice, but at this point that has diverged so much that it really isn't a factor unless looking at the old spelling of knife (basically we're the reason for some of the stupid kn words)
---
Oh and a lot of folklore words are at least phonetically similar because we all borrowed them from the same places so we often end up with easily recognizable translation if they are old folklore creatures.
---
Why not just pull out the strategy guide you bought in 2005?
---
eu here, damn : ) any idea what is the latency on us realms for eu people? I may roll on us with they fck up the servers
---
The only way the two are related is that you can want anything.  That doesn't mean you'll get it though.  Just because you don't get something doesn't mean it's going to ruin Classic for you.  Nothing is a huge deal.  It's just not.
---
That's why I want a big population cap... 8k pop is still like 3 times more than original classic cap... It may be really crowded at first but it will dissipate over time.... Limiting layering to 30 would help too... They could even add dynamic spawns for that first week... I would rather start playing a week after release than have my immersion ruined by phasing... That's what I did on Nostralius and had a blast... And that server had like 14k pop...
---
ey, u said a month or 2.
---
it also depends on how many layers a realm gets, more layers will hurt the post-layer game longer
---
So you think you're entitled to your version of classic because you asked blizzard for it and everyone else is just a guest in your world? Yeah, get real man. It's blizzard's show and this is the route they're taking it, so be outraged
---
I was constantly going back and forth between maining a hunter or warrior, and if these bugs aren't fixed my choice will be pretty easy. I'm still holding out hope that stuff will get fixed though.
---
Bet it's exactly like they do shards, and blocking the IP of the current shard will push you into the next one.
---
They all had layering, they all had all their layers merged at the end. 3 had incredibly small population layers and 15 had more people but it still looked like a pretty low number
---
Sure that's fair. I'm more-so talking about the tree based structure of reddit threads. It's a lot better for long discussions.
---
I didn't see the other exapmles in the github, I just looked at the Doombringer example in the main thread which was 3%.
---
Layering applies to the whole server. You can't enable it for one zone and disable it for the next. It's continent wide.
---
Hey! :)
---
To the guy who make the detailed post about it:  Great job!
---
They just said they're getting it right.  Fucking cry more.  What do you think Beta is for?
---
Oh god, another one of this vapid posts.  We need a megathread to throw all these shitposts about layering in.  Probably another for the language posts.  
---
If it bothers you that much, then don't play.  Most of the shit you see will never happen in game.  People aren't going to be jumping layers to avoid getting ganked.  it takes setup and planning to jump a layer.  You can't just do it on a whim. 
---
What's the next argument?  Well the farmers will get all the black lotus.  Yah, what's new?   You almost never find a black lotus.   You want a black lotus, then you have to buy it.  It's always been like that.
---
Going hard on a pve server hehe
---
thanks for stating obvious... I can want whatever I want? amazing... go back to your hole and let EU people voice their issue. just cause it you cannot understand the problem doesn't not mean you have to post bs here
---
On a good day 300ms-500ms sounds about right.
---
I did this in WoW Model Viewer and also I have no life. I'm being super indulgent with NEs this time around as I've never leveled any to cap, but I love the saber mount. If I'm honest with myself, only the Hunter and Mage will make it to 60. Maybe the Druid lvling with PvP in Phase 3.

Seems like your friends are going to play casually why not roll horde and play with them. Then play alliance when they log out?
---
Good thing this is a beta. Streamers need to abuse the fuck out of this so bliz takes notice
---
You can bitch about layering, that's fine. Bitching about layering being tested on the BETA is pant-on-head retarded.
---
&gt; So why are you for preventing other people from reliving their own experience ?
---
We had a server in vanilla which was like a least 50% Hungarians. This time probably there won't be as many servers. Also with the addition of german and french people, it is hardly unlikely that this small population of Hungary will conquer half of a realm for itself. 
---
This time we will probably play on a server where we will have like 10% of Hungarian population.
---
So why are you preventing my vanilla experience? Vanilla is the past and the past cannot be recreated.
---
You have never tried to do any quest inside a cave with dynamic respawns have you?
---
Think of how easy it would be to get node spawns for gathering rare resources. There’s a lot of ways to abuse it.
---
Because you'd need 100k wolves running around the abbey to remove the need for layering, which would obviously make the game unplayable in its own right.
---
That's much further away from classic than having a bunch of servers under one umbrella.
---
Awesome! Even has the traditional open water bottle on the table!
---
small price to pay to avoid non-english general chat, thanks mate
---
Because nothing has ever been adjusted before. You're stupid if you think it won't be done. The same addon can be made to work in classic.
---
Wouldn't be surprised if its kept quiet to abuse within a group of people though.
---
A french complaining about accents is hilarious af
---
There doesn't seem to be a lot of attention on this issue, which is my worry. Blizzard also haven't said anything about it in classic Blizzard style, so to be honest I would not be surprised if the bugs made it to launch.
---
But Blizzard says they know better so I trust them
---
Here’s to community!
---
Clearly he hasnt. Go try and do The Relics of Wakening with dynamic respawns on, LOL
---
You must be trolling. Nobody is this pathetic and serious about it. 
---
And your opinion is trash. They have no means of telling how many people are going to come back to Classic simply because they have no data points to extrapolate from. They have no user profiles for people who haven't been playing their games and even randomized beta access would not give you a sample to forecast from because it is only random among subscribers. You can't count what you can't measure and you can't predict something that has never happened before. Even if they run targeted surveys (which nobody is aware of so far) all they have is a fart in the wind and the incentive not to fuck over their main product.
---
Here's what's going to happen. We'll see them start with the absolute minimal amount of servers they can get away with at launch, because it's the sensible thing to do. If demand is really as large as some make it to be we'll just see lots and lots of layers and eventually get an excuse why that's just how the game needs to be now.
---
Hard in the paint
---
Caves are hard enough with regular respawns.
---
Looks great dude!
---
Three things impress me here
---
1. The bug report
---
2. That Blizzard admitted wrongdoing 
---
3. That something this important could have gone completely unnoticed all the way to Kel'thuzad
---
Great to see such quick action taken when there is sufficient evidence in the bug report to validate the reporter's claim.
---
As much as I'd like to see some of the nitpicky changes like floating combat text size etc fixed, bugs like this being fixed is most definitely more pertinent.
---
Yes, Gj /u/moldonmywindow for bringing attention back to it with [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c3fzzm/can_we_please_get_blizzards_attention_on_auto/)

Multiple accounts can multi box, of course they have an advantage
---
Well when wondering where numbers come from might wanna check the source of the material.
---
If you enjoy not being able to communicate so much join one of the non English servers then. Easy as that.
---
A lot of us were stealing wearing tier 3 and other Naxx gear in SSC and TK.

Why don’t you just make an alt to play with them and play your main on whatever faction you want?
---
With so many players will it be as hard as soloing?

I understand the problem just fine.  Europe has what, 40 or 50 countries?  Each one gets a language server.  Oh wait, each one gets *three* servers, ( RP, PVP, PVE ).  You want 120-150 servers for just EU for Classic?  They won't even dedicate **ONE** server to RP-PVP but you think they can support all the languages of Europe on their own three servers?
---
Oh I get it.  It's because it's **YOUR** language that it's an important thing.  You don't give a shit if some not popular language gets a server or not.  Hypocrite.
---
We've had 3 different people look into it and none of them have been able to replicate it. Paging /u/iDylo for more details, but I think that's the gist of it.
---
Ask her high fantasy questions of what sort of weapons she likes and what kind of attacks she'd like to do. Magic or melee. What kind of magic. Narrow it down and present her with a few options that match her answers. Let her pick but dont make her pick blindly. Also show her the tier 1 2 and 3 sets. She may never get em but they really capture the class fantasy and what it's all about. Roll classes that dont compete for gear and stay together until she tells you to leave. It will be a togetherness activity until she's into it.
---
Try playing with your network settings in game under networking set it to ipv6 see if that makes a difference. IPv6 headers are different then ipv4 which may reduce some latency. Cheers!
---
Professions make money. Someone farming mats can break an economy. Imagine layer hopping to skin devilsaurs.
---
There was a post yesterday about a guy in Gurubashi Arena who went to 7 different layers and got 7 Gurubashi chests.
---
Same but I stopped at legion.
---
Well yeah but they only got it right because a player dug through web archives and made an absurdly detailed report
---
It doesn't bode well for mechanics that aren't documented in wiki's or web archives, of which there are surely many
---
I mean, if you got to close to 60 without realizing you are playing on a 'foreign' realm, then that means you're not interacting with many people. And if you're not interacting with people then I think language won't be an issue.
---
Most fun I've had just starting the game up and then closing it again because I dont have a sub yet. Compared to BFA!
---
#r00fles!!
---
lots nice pservers that do Vanilla better than Classic...
---
And make it less of a guessing game before you dump days into the game.
---
Sounds like you dont want to play classic, you want to play current retail with a level/gear cap.
---
I don't disagree that there should definitely be some concern, and if it ships like that , then outage should be expected from the community at large. But that's different than people saying people who like the idea behind layering are the devil because it has potential to be bad. We don't want bad layering, we want it to work as intended. If it ships on this state, then yes, I will be upset. But I will be way more upset if they scrap it altogether and I have to use half my time I could be playing waiting to actually login and the other half waiting on the crowd to die down just to do quests
---
Blizzard responded 30min ago, it is bugged and they have developed a fix internally.

I got constant group invites or invited people to groups while questing. Leveled with someone from the Den to Razor Hill until he had to go to bed, grouped up for troll killing, harpies, for the lvl 12 goblin, then the Skull rock cave place. Stopped to help people who looked close to dying and had a few people rescue me, too. Had plenty of people stop to buff me or cheer me on while taming pets as well.
---
The thing is, there's not going to be enough servers for each "language" to claim their own. I feel like for Europe, there's going to be around 5 servers. Two PvP, two PvE, and one RP.
---
Wait a second...this means melee (and hunters) got slightly weaker across the board.
---
Same here. I can't wait to sit in queue for an hour to get in, then be unable to progress because we're balls-to-ass with everyone else trying to kill the one living mob still in the area, only to see it get tagged by someone spamming some instant cast.

Definately play with your friends IMO. Having that initial support network around is very handy. 
---
Unless your friends are Shit gamers? Then don’t play with them
---
There is no screen shot my man!
---
This is why blizzard is having so much beta testing. Hopefully they listen to feedback, which they have been so far so I dont see why they'd stop now
---
I played on a low pop server in Vanilla and it was perfectly fine. Very few raid groups overall, only one on each faction worth talking about. I never knew things could be different so it was never a big deal. I knew the people in front of the auction house and those in my guild and that was all that mattered.
---
As long as it is known then okay, I just turned off subreddit style then
---
Lol ever played with the Chinese? Or the Russians? They're legendary for being impossible to group with on this server so I dunno wtf you're on about OP.
---
You can jump layers on a whim. All you gotta do is have someone you know invite you to a group and bam! New layer no gank. I bought a dagger from someone and when I invited them to my group it put them in my layer. They almost died because of all the mobs on my layer were there. They had cleared them all on their layer.
---
There will be a dedicated crowd on RP realms, just like back in the day. If you want to meet really nice people, play a pve RP realm, good experiences guaranteed.
---
Scarcity always sets in.  People who spend P1 farming the crap out of P1 layers will eventually run out of their abundance and the economy will stabilize.  Maybe it will become more of a buyers market for the first few months into P2, but ultimately, it'll be business as expected.
---
Bros before gnomes.  If your friends give any indication they'll play longer than phase 1, go to your friends.
---
what? I want pure english server you moron, then add few like german, french, spanish and idk what else so those people have their own server... I never said every fucking country should get one/three servers...     
---
   
---
I don't want 80% people on the realm speaking spanish when it is labeled as english server... again gtfo, you understand nothing
---
Nonsense. It will be gone, and those who choose to stay on overpopulated servers can sit in hours long queues until they get the hint and take the likely free transfers to lower pop servers.
---
Let her play alone. When you're with a duo - there's that element of keeping up, don't want to explore, am I being optimal, asking for help, etc.
---
Let start the journey solo for a bit - roll an alt and level it if she wants the duo later on, but imo, let her discover her own world at first.
---
1. race visual update OPTION. I've seen so many posts about this. Some people want it, let them have it as it affects no one but them. 
---
Updated textures and  models for the environment could be done as an optional graphic toggle, but the models would have to keep the same shape/collision as the old models, which I don't think every new model does. It would be jarring to have a new high detail model next to a 15 year old model. 
---
2. Pet AI from BFA. Vanilla hunter pet combat is a joke, and there are so many bugs with the classic system that I don't see the point of them the trying to implement the old system when the new system just works. I feel this is one of the few changes that has actually improved over the expansions.

wonder if vpn could help... I'm not really that tech savvy in the network stuff, but I'll save your tip and test it out on the US servers!

They aren't labeling any of them "English server".  They're just servers with names.  Go wherever the fuck you want.

The issue is the extra leeway in beta compared to vanilla.

don't worry, you also get a deadzone that is literally twice as large as it should be as well as feign death barely working
---
I would play with your friends, 100%. I wouldn't even hesitate man. You'll have way more fun playing with friends. That being said, Alliance is much better in classic. Unfortunately, all of my friends are playing alliance (and have been since Mop) and I've been a diehard Hordie at heart since Warcraft 2. :( I would never go back horde unless they did too. They are what make the game fun, not the faction you play on.
---
Agreed.  There are no world firsts in classic.
---
At first, I thought those curtains could be pulled around your desk to hide shame in preparation for classic release.
---
Said by a person who feels entitled to layering because they want a “smooth launch” - suck a fat one.
---
&gt; I remember classic this way, with a fully German community.
---
I remember vanilla as playing on a server with at least 50% Hungarians. This time there will be probably around  6 realms with french and germans. There is no way Hungarians will have their 50%+ server this time and we will be stuck with several other nationalities. 
---
I won't have the same big Hungarian community. Probably Finish, Czech, Polish, Swedish, Turkish etc people won't have their own servers either.
---
I agree that this is a horrible decision, but  spewing insults doesn't help a bit, except someone managing to blow off some steam. Insults don't even help, as whatever real feedback the post may contain gets easily ignored. Criticism, hell yes, but keep it constructive.

Apart from that, the majority of the closed threads were closed as duplicates and that makes sense - it's much better to bundle all the feedback in one big thread.
---
is everyone in US this retarded or it is just you? you just cannot stay away from shit that has no influence on you
---
The problem you're having is that you're thinking of overall server population, which is far less important than the concentration within particular zones.  
---
For the first tens of hours of play every single player is going to be focused across a half dozen zones.  The longer into release we get the more spread out players get.  Layering is intended to alleviate the strain of those first hours where we're all in the noob zones.  The alternative is to have a few thousand people all desperately fighting to kill the same boars.
---
I miss the fan comics section of the website.  This was one of my faves and its what's in my head every time I have done SM since.  Hell, when they introduced her in HotS I was missing this comic.
---
Wonder if they will make a post about leeway today, should be interesting.
---
Genuine question: Isn't the first pic what happened in Vanilla WoW? Wouldn't being forced to play on a server that doesn't speak your language be an authentic vanilla experience? I've heard many stories of players who had to go through that you see.
---
You aren’t friendly. A different set of social rules apply on a rp server. Same for rp-pvp. Rp-pvp is the same as pvp except you have to follow rules like what you can name your character. No illidanks on a rp rule server.
---
Impact is the word you were looking for.  Not influence.  ESL?
---
Saved, thank you!
---
I have played on two different private servers and that's where a lot of my desire for some QoL comes from. Leveling can be downright miserable at times because of over crowding. There's so many people, I don't even recognize more than maybe 1 in any given zone after a day. I still group when I want or need to, and I do love that aspect. But you shouldn't be forced to group for non challenging quests just to complete them. It's just not good game play. 
---
Now the second they announce raid finder or dungeon finder, that's worthy of a riot. To say that a temporary system will destroy classic is just too much for me to agree with. If classic dies because of 2 months of layering then we need to admit that we thought we did but we didn't. But I highly expect that that's not going to be the case and many old and new people will enjoy the game. Just my 2 cents
---
You say I'm "too lazy" yet after your second post you still haven't backed up your argument at all without providing any solutions. If you dont have a solution or are tired of explaining, maybe it's best not to post or argue at all.
---
As for why I gave only two solutions, it isn't because I'm regurgitating Blizzard, it's because I do networking for businesses for a living and understand the weighing of decisions they went through to get to this decision. It's simply frustrating to me to see people like yourself beat a dead horse. 
---
Layering will happen until the congestion slows down after a month or so. You can't expect them to do anything different. They're a business first and foremost. They will not spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to support the influx of people playing on launch when they know very well that over half of those people will stop playing after a few days or weeks. If you want to get upset over it, save it for when the flood settles. If they don't remove layering after the great exodus happens, THAT is when it is time to be upset.
---
&gt; People acting like a few weeks is no big deal have no idea how hardcore the Classic community is.
---
The large majority of people who play Classic for the 1st month won't be hardcore private server players. Layering isn't for you, it's for normal players who actually give a shit about the launch going smoothly. Most people would rather have layering than have the launch be a complete mess. And Blizzard cares a lot more about those people than a small percentage of no-lifers trying to exploit anything they can, because they'll all be playing anyway. 
---
Blizzard could come out and say "fuck off, we don't care about people rushing MC or mass farming shit for a few weeks, were keeping layering for however long we deem necessary." And guess what, all those people and all the people here would still play it, because it's still by far the best Vanilla experience available.
---
Again, Blizzard wants launch to be a good experience for the average person who is interested, they are not worried about tryhards. And regardless of that, a lot of people like myself, who have played on PS'ers, would still prefer layering, with all its downsides, to the complete clusterfuck that a layerless launch would be.
---
But eventually, when the abundance can't be maintained(with the removal of layers after P1), the scarcity settles back in.  It'll be a buyer's market until that abundance runs out, for sure, but then it won't be.
---
Yeah, not going to deal with that shit.
---
LITERACY IS HARD
---
I would not restrict her to playing any one class. 
---
I think if you tell her overall what each class does (abilities), she should decide. There are plenty of YouTube videos that provide a quick reference to each class. 
---
To that, don’t “teach” her how to play her class. Part of the fun of playing is figuring out things for yourself. 
---
My suggestion is your role should be there primarily for support and to show some “tips and tricks” of WoW. Things like, addons, action bars, answering questions like “what does a hearthstone do”. You can be her guide to this massive world, but let her also try to figure some stuff out on her own. 
---
Get yourselves in a good guild and allow her the opportunity to make friends with the guild. You will be her #1 person to play with obviously. But have her branch out and play with others as well. Again, this is what makes classic great.
---
I think it's unrealistic to expect anything close to a smooth solo questing experience at launch. Trying to make it so will introduce more serious problems like layering has. Instant respawns will do a lot to ease the chaos at launch without creating major gamebreaking issues.
---
&gt; i think i must be missing the big picture as i dont beleive layering will have effect 12months after lanuch 
---
depending on how long layering exists and how many layers get made, it can effect the economy close to or longer than 12 months into classic.  5 layers for 2 months = 12 months to equalize
---
Layered*
---
We know exactly what 10k players on a server with dynamic respawns looks like from private servers. It's annoying but very playable for for the first day. After that it doesn't make much difference. 10,000 players, 1 server, 0 layering/phasing.
---
&gt; The biggest issue I've found is rezzing. A couple of times I've died very close to where you did but was brought to a different spirit healer. At the quarry for instance, I died to the same mobs that you died to...and instead of rezzing back at Kharanos I was booted all the way up to Ironforge. After turning in Return to Marleth I discovered Gnomergon just a few feet from where you did...but when I died to the mobs I aggro'd I was booted back to Coldridge (while you were sent to Kharanos). The mobs outside of Coldridge (same ones you died to) that enabled you to rez in Kharanos made me rez in Coldridge again. It could be as small as a microscopic bit of distance, but it's worth considering for me personally.
---
That was my first thing to check on the stress test.
---
I used to die @ gnomer to get to coldridge to start there, but gotta run there on Classic. ANY death outside of Coldridge will rez you in Kharanos, pretty much. Death zones are much different in classic than on Pservers. A few friends and I tested death warps a lot last stress test, any testing on a private server isn't worth it.
---
I really enjoyed that "witch" returned as "heks".  Makes sense, as I'd expect a witch to cast a hex on someone!
---
oh look I made mistake and you just had to be the grammar nazi... english is like my 4th language, so sorry I wrote wrong word! thank you for fixing it for me!
---
I'm sorry, I have no idea how you came to that conclusion from what I posted. You're clearly just upset that I disagree with you and so be it.
---
&gt; As far as I can tell, it really hurts PvP (ganking mostly). 
---
How?  The only way to switch layers is to be invited by someone in another layer.   Do you really think people will be able to find a group in another layer in the instant before you kill them?   
---
That's not going to happen much, if at all. 
---
Streamers can do it, because they have a cult following.
---
Its too hard with groups. You don’t know what you’re asking for. There will be respawns before you kill the last mob. You will never leave combat. Any quest in a cave becomes impossible because you can’t kill the mobs fast enough even with a group.
---

---
&gt; Noticeable, but clearly not the power difference people think to have noticed.
---
I'd bet money on any serious retail player being able to easily notice a 6%-9% difference on their ability damage, considering how many times in the past few years patches were just straight nerfs of 5-10 percent on an ability.
---
You sure cry a lot about not understanding people for being able to talk to so many.

That’s the quest I had in mind lol.
---
I dont think everyone is getting that memo. I agree that its likely what is wrong here but some people seem to just be parrots for the "cause" and are diluting the actual problem with their idiocracy.
---
RemindMe! 5 Months "What will you say if it isn't gone like you're so certain of?"
---
It was asked by the streamers in the "Influencer" event they were invited to, and it was the number they were given. I believe it was also mentioned in one of their Q&amp;A videos a few of them were allowed to do. I'd have to find it.
---
They're con men. They're going to give you something that looks like Classic but it's just the modern client in disguise.
---
Yeah, I'm not sure what your point is. 
---
I'm talking about how Layering will still exist across the entire continent, as it is now on the beta, in it's current, exploitable state, even after Phase 1.
---
It is a literal fuck-fest. LOL
---
This and leeway needs to be adjusted/fixed before launch. Otherwise it's going to be a shit show.
---
But you know that now and so do the plurality of people. I'm not saying it can't be enjoyable, but I think a lot of people want more populated servers that last longer
---
I don't think it will be indefinite. Remember, the stress test servers were just that: an attempt to stress the servers as much as possible. What better way to do it than to get as many people on one as you can?
---
So they have been super clear that it will be gone by phase 2, and you somehow read that to mean never? Also, what makes you think phase 2 will be in 5 months? This whole thing reeks of you being a moron who simply hates blizzard.
---
Didn't edit anything.
---
Ok?  I'll do the same quests.  I'll level the same characters.  I'll run the same dungeons.  Will my DPS be identical?  I don't care.  
---
Will people care about stuff like that?  Sure.  But I won't.
---
intimidate + scatter is better vs casters. but its more of an 1vs1 spec.
---
Survival is better for general team play since it has other useful talents besides counter attack.
---
As far as we know right now, layering will only exist through P1.  I'm realistically giving that 1-3mo after launch, so talking December at the latest.  Every conversation regarding layering assumes that players will easily be able to determine what layer they are on and how to escape it, which unless there is a UI element depicting that, I think is going to be harder to than people think.  Keep in mind that, presumably, each layer on a server will contain between 2-3k people.
---
Looking at a plan doesn't mean it's your plan. I was looking into buying a new car, doesn't mean I planned on buying a car. You are legit delusional.
---
dont playthen?
---
stop projecting... you are crying here that eu people want something. so done with you, such a waste of time talking with someone braindamaged like you
---
I thought this would make picking my main easier...
---
Never understood why cant you say 1,5 year old.
---
You posted this already!
---
Can someone explain to me what this means
---
Lol so triggered because I don't want to live in YOUR ideal version of classic. 
---
Look, if blizzard came out tomorrow and said no layering, I would still happily play classic. If you can't say the same in reverse, we will just have fun without you :)
---
Magey (OP in forum post) is the one who deserves the most credit for testing in the beta and identifying this bug.
---
The phases are 3 months each right? Let me know if I'm not remembering the graphic they put out right.  So 2 months from now is the start of phase 1, thus 3 months after 2 months is... 5 months.
---
Don't know why you're being so rude about it.  If I hated Blizz I wouldn't be resubbing again just to play classic.
---
How yall remember that stuff?  I can't even remember how to get through Wailing Caverns.
---
Two things wrong with them:  dumbasses parroting their videos, and the cult of personality causing huge flocks of dumbasses to follow them in game.  It’s like they somehow got more annoying than those multiboxers wandering around with 40 accounts nuking everything in sight.  It’s just that instead of 40 accounts it’s 400 twitch kiddies.  
---
And that’s just the major ones.  The small fries bring their own brand of annoyance with their pathetic cries to go check out their channel pretty please.
---
Horde female orc combat rogue.  I was already going to play that.  This thing is psychic.
---
I had a line of code wrong &gt;&lt; 
---
Code is clean now
---
&gt; The main problem that needs solving is quest bottlenecks right?
---
No, the main problem is solving the artificial population inflation that the "tourists" will cause when they flood the servers at launch.
---
I make a simple UI for this, just give a idea.. i so like this kind GPS map game. A opening world. U can farm the monster , doing quest, or crafting the items, or PVP the play when u meet them. or war. But. this kind game only pokemon go, and today's new game Harry Potter。 Just no feeling about Harry Potter. Really hope Blizzard consider this kind game, Hope Gaming engineer form Blizzard see this .
---
Amen! Preach!
---
Layering seems designed to avoid the hassle (on Blizzard's part) of merging servers later.  Doesn't seem like the right thing for players.
---
I don’t think the scarcity will settle back in. If I farm devilsaurs every day hopping layers constantly to get more faster then I’ll never run out. I’ll stack my alts full of it. The economy will crash because there’s too much and eventually because no one needs it. With all the gold I’d have i could afford to offer rock bottom prices to kill any competition. All it takes is one person to ruin it for everyone else. I’ve seen what happens when someone can afford to lock everyone else out.
---
Good, now fix layering.

---
That should drive the prices down considerably which is nice!
---
You literally defended the implementation of layering by saying “it’s gonna be fucked anyway, why not have layering.”
---
Ahhhh makes sense, isn’t there guilds that hunts them down though?
---
pick a different server for your alliance main and roll a casual horde char on the server with your friends. then you can decide while playing how much time you invest on the horde side.  If your friends turn out to be proper progression players you can even decide to concentrate fully on that side, but if they turn out to be casual tourists, you can return to alliance
---
A mobile game that requires WoW players to actually leave their house.  
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Cool concept but destined to fail.
---
Fuck that, there's no way I'm playing with my people. Absolutely refuse.
---
Either way can’t say I’m wrong. That was their initial plan for it. I would like for you to find proof otherwise.
---
Everybody talks shit on the horde until they want to win a BG.
---
&gt; Sure, some servers will be low enough population to remove layering, but there will be many, many servers where they just can't do it.
---
And in some cases, I imagine the lack of layering when word of mouth spreads will only attract more people. Which then brings in the need of layering, in blizzard's eyes.
---

Did you find any keys? It doesn't show up until then.
---
So you want to double the workload with same amount of people? :thinking:
---
Dude. Let people who want to play with streamers play with streamers. I'm sure it'll be fun for them. It doesn't make them "pathetic", let people play how they want. Relax and stop trying to karma circle jerk farm this sub
---
So where have you heard that Blizzard has said they will KEEP it if necessary?
---
Speed don't matter for online games, latency does
---
Avoid Satellite and you are good
---
Then why do you keep doing it?
---
Right, and that was a change I agree with both from a farming and strategy point of view. Limitation breeds innovation. When you can just use everything there's no question about what to do; you just pop every consumable you can regardless of how inconsequential. When you're forced to pick and choose you need to put some conscious thought into which ones are the best for you, and I think that makes for better gameplay.
---
Really appreciate the reply. I suspected as much but wasn't sure if it was me being marginally off the mark or not. I'll probably just casually watch the rest of your video to see the route and if the game's too congested on launch day I'll have no issue following your route. Could even watch along again. ;)
---
Thanks for putting the time &amp; effort into this. Wish you had more comments/view/etc., I think this is seriously underrated content.
---
I decided to do a bit more digging, specifically for any examples of leeway in Vanilla, with the most immediate result being Unbreakable's Enhancement video. It makes for a good comparison as being a 2H user, auto attacks are clear and well spaced, and there's just a single melee ability that you can watch the range for (assuming visual clarity of the bind in the clip)  
---
While I'm not offhand familiar with the patch that it was recorded on, there's an extremely clear point ([https://youtu.be/ja1j7xWpB3w?t=568](https://youtu.be/ja1j7xWpB3w?t=568)) where both the player and the enemy were moving at full speed, yet Stormstrike could not be casted and no AA's occurred until the enemy turned towards Unbreakable. This was while *extremely* close, much closer than what leeway allows for. Obviously not an infallible example as there's a lot of underlying reasons that could result in this, but I think should still be taken into account.  
---
I didn't play during Vanilla, or at least I have to clear memories of it. I started with my own account in TBC at somewhere around the age of 12, so I can't personally say 100% for sure if it did exist or not.
---
Just because code can be adjusted doesnt mean it can do whatever it wants. This isnt a C program with root access to the server.
---
Well it was always the case in Europe for English servers. There was always like 20 languages on English servers, now it will be 23. Not a big deal.
---
&gt;the people farming high lvl mats from months 2-12 still won't have farmed more than the people who farmed those mats in month 0-2
---
in your world with no layering and 5 hour queues. the people not playing at all are getting zero anything to add to the economy. huge disadvantage
---
This. Blizzard (and the community) couldn't care less about questing efficiency.
---
You guys realize that Layering doesn't proportionally increase the number of mobs and nodes, right?
---
An ideal server has 3,000 people.  There's 4 black lotus spawns every 2 hours, so 2 per hour.
---
A server with 5 layers has 20 black lotus every 2 hours or 10 per hour.  Thing is, there's 15,000 people on 5 layers.   5x the population, 5x the spawns.
---
They haven't said anything about length, 3 months is likely much shorter than they will end up being. If you didn't hate blizz you wouldn't be so sure that they were lying to you with clear statements about how layering would be gone by phase 2.
---
I’m in the same boat, to be honest.
---
Friends.
---
Basically instant attacks like mortal strike, sinister strike etc was doing more damage than they should.
---
Because in Classic you can't play with people from other realms so there's a chance some of us will be stuck in a realm full of germans/french or whatever. If you don't think that's a problem then there's nothing more I can say. Feels like I'm talking to a monkey who can't use his brain.
---
Can you show me some official word from blizzard where they say there will only be a handful of realms per region? Thanks.
---
Comments like this turn people who would be for your cause against you.
---
That's a true argument, assuming that you can hop layers constantly forever.  I concede your point.  However, based on what we've been told so far, layering will end after Phase One(tm).  Eventually you will run out.  Your alts will run out.  You'll be rich as crap, but eventually you'll run out and someone else will have to farm to keep up with demand.  Scarcity settles back in now that it isn't so easy.
---
Also I'd like to point out that this, as with every conversation on abusing layers, assumes that it will be easy to do so--players will somehow be able to easily know what layer they are on, and how to escape it.  Presumably each layer is supposed to contain between 2-3k players, I think that it's going to be more difficult than people think.
---
He doesn't, he's making shit up.

Eeshnuala
---
BLIZZARD ARE TURNING THE FROGS GAY
---
Low effort garbage repost and English as your 5th language.
---
Looking through your post history it looks like a trend.
---
&gt; keep you in the game for as long as possible
---
In all fairness, that's my goal as well.
---
We all know how that goes.
---
it's part of the AQ gate opening quest line
---
[I posted a short video a while ago on how you actually get there as part of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmdUUq5pdTE)
---
There isnt.
---
🤣 Oh no total mat output will go up 0.1% with this trick! Classic is ruined 😂😭🤣😝🤣😂😭
---
&gt; I just wanted to err on the side of caution :)
---
couldn't you shoot Blizzards WoW division an email? worst case, they say not allowed, it would be okay if a contracted portion of profits went to them, or its completely fine so long as you credit them and what not.
---
so either, nothing changes for the first two (unless you took them up on some kind of offer, although id doubt it because of the hassle) or they give the A-Okay and your ass is covered?
---
Guess who’s back, back again
---
Well done. Both of you.
---
can you elaborate what's wrong with the comment?
---
That’s like trying to make fishes walk, cool concept, and of course there will be a niche for that but it just won’t catch the larger audience man, the stereotype is real, wow players are all anti social nerds. I am a proud trash of humanity.
---
I'd say go with your preference of high-end raiding. You might only get one chance to do this again, so if you really want to go full tryhard then do so. You can reroll down the line with your friends if it isn't for you.
---
What's up mate, glad you're here.
---
&gt; how do you find teammates for dungeons or quest? How do you trade ?
---
Learn English? When I started the game at 12years old I did not even know what "realm" or "launch" mean. I could not even understand a single quest or tutorial. Now I am fluent in English and also work with this language.
---
No, I’m going to play what I want, which is an Undead holy priest.
---
Kek it with your mates
---
That broom is actually a pretty rare drop. Or was that the pitchfork?
---
Thanks!
---
Won't you know right away if everyone in the starter zone is speaking German?  So you're "stuck" for like five minutes until you pick a new server.  Seems like a deal breaker to me.
---
There are more languages in Europe than there ever were server types.  You are always going to run into people who don't speak your language, wherever you are.
---
Same thing.  You get caught in the mess as the stumble about, and that’s not even getting in to their latest bitch fit about “stream sniping” where they want people punished for messing with their stream.
---
Nah, if my experiences on private servers are anything what this would be like. All it does is cause issues. Language barrier.  Culture barrier.  Timezones that screw with the natural ebb and flow of what is suppost to  be peak and off times.
---
We need updates on layering and now this.
---
It also "just" involves leveling enchanting to like 260 or something.
---
It's a drag on coin
---
Was about to say the same thing, but I gotta admit seeing it made me imagine dueling people on the street. Would be kinda neat but how many abilities can you realistically have?
---
&gt; Wish you had more comments/view/etc
---
I'm not a 'content creator' i couldn't give many shits about those things :P
---
Leeway =/= This Cataclysm era movement based attack range increase.
---
Leeway was in vanilla, this was not.
---
You would be wrong sir, happened a lot
---
This could be one of the bigger reasons people say the content feels easier than private servers.
---
&gt; Why don’t you just ~~make an alt to play with them and play your main on whatever faction you want~~**POWERLEVEL AND GANK THE SHIT OUT OF THEM**?
---
FTFY
---
Thats probably true. I didnt started until summer of 05. 
---
I just remember everyone calling it VC.
---
That's not true, but even if it was, how does that ruin the economy again?
---
Dude.... it is promised to be removed after the first few weeks
---
So we are a special breed of humans capable of enjoying MMO's? topkek
---
Rogue in Vanilla was all about not getting hit. You are basically paper, squishy as fuck. Do. Not. Get. Hit. If your CC comes up in 2 seconds and they have 20% HP, dont chance it. Throw a blind or vanish, possible gouge to get more energy for the kill. Rogues instantly die most of the time. It's all about completely locking down the other player.
---
Hurp durp but it just betaaaa
---
Also very useful for rogues with vanish!
---
Just hope they put in the gbank from retail so Blizz doesn't have to deal with tickets from ninjas and account sharing and clog up the mail system.
---
They don't. The stress test had what, 21 servers? Why bother when you only plan to roll out 3?
---
My point is that you don't understand what layering is for.
---
Hey, I love the post and plan on maining a druid. What other awesome druid macros do you have?
---
This isn't something to get upset about, please try to behave. Blizzard doesn't go up on that stage without a plan talking about what they brought up at the dev meeting the week before. Announcing their intents at a high-profile event like Blizzcon means that those are definitely _plans_ in action. You're really just nitpicking at very loosely defined words here.
---
This is the message i wanted to hear, and exactly the reason i worded my title the way i did
---
&gt; This is unfair to the people who don't want to speak English when they play and have a reasonable expectation to be able not to
---
What is reasonable expectation? Most languages never had their own realms ever in WoW. Why is it more reasonable for a German/French/Spanish to have it's own realm than to any other language?
---
&gt;Don't give up faith in the classic team
---
Crossing your fingers and hoping a game turns out well is how games die
---
okay i love you bye, bye!
---
That’s true, blizzard takes care more for streamers as they put a good pic for wow, but the majority players who just wants to have fun are thrown away since we spend less money. Getting raped in stranglethorn is already enough, but having a “rogue party” as a prank just isn’t good for anyone.
---
Freaking LOVE the guild name!
---
So whichever comes first?
---
Check out  [https://www.avoidstreamers.com/](https://www.avoidstreamers.com/) , it should be helpful to avoid the big ones
---
Because retail sucks dick and I want to play classic?
---
Because historically, there were ~150 million unique accounts created in World of Warcraft, so even if just 1% of all the players that ever played the game come back, you're looking at 1.5mil.
---
yeah generally DM:T &gt;&gt; DM:E &gt;= Maraudon 
---
Mages can also Croc Farm in ZG which on release might also grant nice profits and I assume it will beat other farm methods for a while until the initial demand drops.
---
I remember the alliance destroyed the horde in sentinel hill and half of them just hearthed away
---
I died up top of the Hill north of Xroads while doing the quest Demon seed and spawned south of xroads. The run back was still 100x better than BFA.
---
It's not official yet, just piecing together what we know:
---
1. Germany is 20% of the EU player base and Blizzard believes that is not enough to sustain one Classic realm at launch, suggesting EU won't be getting more than 5 realms. The EU has a similar playerbase to NA.
---
2. When talking about the number of EU realms, Blizzard said they would be getting "several".
---
3. The last stress test, which was open to all NA+Oceania subscribers, intended to test 15 to 21 realm combinations but quickly had to be reduced to 4 realms.
---
None of this is conclusive, but it definitely means it won't be like the days of old with 100+ realms to choose from.
---
How did Lisbon suck?  I loved it.
---
In the back of the conference room, Bobby Kotick peels back his skin and reveals...
---
in my world you pick a layer and can't change it until it dies enough to get merged with another layer.  and if your layer stays popular you never have to worry about other layers having any effect on yours
---
It will be for Blizzard to test and say if it is or isnt a part of 1.12 or not
---
Doesn't surprise me, thought that was happening too
---
Always love all the armchair engineers that pop up on these threads.
---
Saying blizzard should "just turn layering off" is one of the most pebkac things I've ever heard.
---
Indeed they will, 
---
but kinda annoying for the people that hate streamers, since they will have to tune into the stream and filter out a bunch of troll saying random server names to confuse people (yes this is going to happen 100%)
---
I personally don''t have anything agains't streamers, but i think asmon should expose which server he will be playing on ahead of time :)
---
Then you're looking for shaman, but you'll still be support. Or druids if you want to world pvp and don't mind longer fights without burst
---
Shadow priests melt too if your guild has room or doesn't care about minmax
---
You'd think a pretty basic test would be loading up identical characters in reference and 1.13 and making sure attacks are identical. It does make you wonder...
---
Ally, PvP, on NA server.
---
**Very** obviously so, I might add.
---
So if a majority of people complain about something, I am supposed to just believe what they all say without first seeing evidence for myself and making my own opinion?
---
You think its sad that this person doesn't decide to just jump on the bandwagon without first having a basis and evidence for their opinion?
---
But I think him saying that he won’t say what server he’s playing on is kinda good, his fans won’t know where he is and it prevents mobs of fanboys.
---
This is a game break design flaw..
---
Nah, he in outland being a nerd.
---
Very brave of you
---
As someone who has experienced and extensively tested WoD alpha/beta &gt; Legion Beta and BfA beta, I can support this conspiracy theory. I bailed after BfA beta though.
---
Asmongold saying that he won't expose which server he will be playing on.
---
What about the mine node video? The low level wow economy is ruined because people can mass farm nodes by playing the layers. Its fucking shit basically.
---
This test was so much fun. I left WoW in Cataclysm and coming back to this, even if it was just a few days, was such a treat! I felt incentivized to reach out to the players around me and socialize. I think it's been said enough, but this is definitely what classic is all about. See you all in August!
---
Consider this. High pop servers will probs get free xfers to low pop ones.
---
Okay, so that's all of them. 
---
Merging kills server culture. If people really are downing MC in one week, when you have two merges you're going to get 80 people on your server that got server first Rag.
---
Spawn rates are a change that makes the game not Classic. They'd have to up them for a large number of zones, most likely the majority of the world, because they can't guess where the bottleneck is going to be. This is going to massively deflate prices of things, and likely cause rep issues.
---
Them doing nothing, kills the game. Period. Lets say that each realm is 7.5k people. I think they announced something close to that. With 6 starter zones that's over 1k per zone. Even if every single person joins a group of 5 that's still over 200 groups, vying for like 30-40 mobs. Let alone how bad collect quests would be. You fuck the launch, you fuck the game. All the people who are casually looking in are going to be driven away by it taking 10+ hours to reach level 10. Then when all you have left is the couple hundred thousand hardcore people, spread out across a ton of realms, you either get merges, killing the aforementioned culture, or just a lack of interest as people go back to pservers because it's all the same people and it's free.
---
big if true
---
Ok mate, see you tomorrow at the flat earth anti vaxxer convention!
---
It's like château.
---
Nice. Hopefully I land on your server, I’ll hit you up on that kit :)
---
I have 3 monitors in general, granted one is a tablet monitor. Main for either game/refs, right monitor for discord/websites, tablet monitor for art program or maps/notes.
---
Horrifying lizard scales.
---
Yeah, it's weird that they can't get basic things like this right and a player actually has to go out and test this in detail in order to get them to fix it.
---
I went from the weapon master in undercity to the one in org without seeing anyone.  
---
then I couldn't get a group for RFC.
---
Start worrying? Retail is already 1 foot in the grave, the time to start worrying for retail players was 3 years ago when titanforging was implemented. Hopefully the post naxx content has harder raids though, because despite all the shitty things in retail the raid mechanics and mythic progression experience are fantastic.
---
/r/classicwow is just /r/wow for classic at this point. Low effort memes, RL images that barely draw a link to the game and nostalgia posts rather than discussion about the actual game.
---
TBH I want the classic servers to be up forever
---
Wtf is layering and can anyone tell me? There’s so much discussion about this and people are split on it.
---
Who wants to be stuck in Darnassus during the stress test eh.
---
I don't know what item that is but that looks/sounds really dirty in written form lol
---
The world would be a much better place if people acted more like this person you are calling sad.
---
How is something like this built? I bet Europe is littered with hidden medieval treasures like this.
---
&gt; You can jump layers on a whim. All you gotta do is have someone you know invite you to a group and bam!
---
Whim my ass...  Damn near every one of you guys whining doesn't even know how layering works.  
---
How will you do that while you are being ganked again?  You would have to jump through several hoops, or already have it planned out.   Anyone that would waste their time planning this out would just play on a pve server.  
---
Even if you fail to gank 1/5 people because of this, who gives a shit?  And just for the record, I would be shocked if it was even 1 in a 100.
---
No layering at all. It's invasive, exploitable, and ruins so much of the core aspect of the game.
---
Back in the OG Vanilla WoW, Blizzard actually manually decreased the spawn timers of mobs in the starting zones during launch in an attempt to handle the large influx of people. I'd much rather they take a similar approach to Classic, with dynamic respawns in the first few zones.
---
Having mobs spawns every 30s in Elwynn isn't going to kill the Classic experience for me, especially considering the amount of players there will keep it in check. I'd much rather them emulate a Vanilla solution to a Classic problem than try to handle it with a solution from Retail.
---
Getting layered mid-combat and spawned into a fresh camp of mobs (resulting in my death), getting layered while on a flight path and dropped into the middle of buttfuck nowhere surrounded by mobs 10+ levels above me, and ganking someone in STV only to have them magically disappear WILL piss me off and completely ruin the Classic experience for me. Not to mention all the exploiting going on with layer-hopping to farm resource nodes / arena grand masters / etc will completely kill the economy. It really encourages people to forego the "journey" and rush to 60 so they can take advantage of this broken system to farm high-tier stuff like Black Lotus and Thorium before layering is removed.
---
Streamers as cancerous as ever
---
Cities are instanced and separate from the layers.
---
See ya there mate. Be careful of the lizard people, they're always watching...
---
Ah, I see.  The length comments I remember reading were based on the original timeline. For example the time between content in what is phase 2 and what is phase 4 was 7 months, so depending on how structured Blizz makes the releases with them having it planned out in advance more than before it's a good bet that it'll be around the clean average 3.5 month(ish).  Same with what is phase 5 - which came out 3 months after the last content of phase 4.  So I can't imagine 3 months is going to be "much shorter." We'll see if they put out a more detailed timeline after release.
---
I'm also not "so sure that they're lying to me."  I'm just doubtful they're actually going to follow throw with fully removing it.  I can easily see something like "While layering is still running in the background, you won't encounter it in the open world.  To increase performance in capital cities, however, there may be layers created during peak times."   Followed by similar defenses to the system we've been seeing, along with snide comments like "I thought you played classic because you wanted to go out into the world, why does layering in cities matter to you?"
---
You'll find you have much better conversations with people if you don't suddenly jump to extremes like "You're a moron for X" and "If you do this you must hate Blizzard."  Find a lot more peace too.
---
Was part of my theory!
---
People here don't like streamers leveraging their audience for things.
---
For one the number of players is going to blow the private servers out of the water. 
---
For two, when do you stop the dynamic respawns? What zone? The Barrens and STV are going to be horribly massive bottlenecks in the first few weeks without something. What if you can trip the dynamic respawn detector in Un'Goro? Doesn't that ruin the economy? Or is it better to have 1k people in Un'Goro?
---
did anyone record it?

Look. keep the aussies happy or they'll transplant some of those frisbee size spiders they keep as pets
---
&gt; Also, who wants the mental exhaustion of interacting in a second language while they're trying to have fun?
---
Like half of Europe? Eastern Eu and other smaller languages never had the chance to have their own client or servers.
---
&gt; Because the population will not dramatically decrease enough within phase 1 to remove layering.
---
You don't know that. Blizzard doesn't know that. Nobody knows for sure what trend the Classic WoW population will follow.
---
However, for almost every other game in existence, the population spikes on release and declines over time.
---
the server i was on had huge undead females called "angry programmer tweedle dee"

Not my work! Bottom of the image shows the real OP I believe. I want to say this comic is old as vanilla.
---
It's like multiple virtual copies of the world on each server. The idea is that a server can hold a lot more people than usual this way. 
---
The goal is to have it in place for the beginning few weeks or so of Classic so that people who come in from BfA (with no intention of staying to actually play Classic) don't end up making a server completely dead population-wise when they leave.
---
Nice info!
---
Eh, only instants isn't it? So it will have an impact, but not a very large one.
---
PREPARE THE WORLD WAR
---
TIL, good trivia.
---
Yes imagine if people actually had access to the reference client how quickly they could find bugs instead of spending hours trawling through 13 year old videos and forums hoping for evidence so that blizzard would take them seriously enough to test it.
---
It’s a cool idea...but pokemon has a WAYYYYYYYY different player base.  Pokemon is played by a lot of young normal people...pretty girls and guys with freshly shorn necks like pokemon.  
---
Having said that...having locations you’d have to meet to do certain dungeons or world bosses...world pvp...it has a ton of potential.
---
At least merging is infinitely more blizzlike and completely avoids the total destruction of authenticity and immersion that phasing/layering provides. At the end of the day, merging dead layers will be the same exact thing as merging dead servers. There is no way in any shape or form you can formulate an argument as to why layering/sharding is preferable. This is literally a multibillion dollar triple A gaming corporation taking the easy streamlined way out of a problem and you are defending it.
---
Hungarians probably have worse English than French and we never had Hungarian client/server. Now where is my Hungarian server?
---
From artificial buff they received created by a bug... sure? Fixing this will bring them back to what they are supposed to be at - whatever the fuck that means anymore.
---
How many of those 10k players will hit 60? How many of those will be around after a year? How many of those will play during peak hours?
---
Layering has just as much to do with long-term server health as short-term launch smoothness.
---
The OP said they shouldn't have layering in the beta though.
---
That's like saying they shouldn't have Warlocks in the beta. It's a thing that's going to be live at launch that they need to test.
---
Ahhhh, I see, thanks!!!
---
Interesting, looks like he layered after all. What a shame...
---
Just start playing when Phase 3 starts.
---
Lol so you want me to find proof that you are lacking proof of their plan? Your proof was them spit balling a potential idea as how to solve the over crowding problem and that's the hill your are willing to die on. That's not how debates work. You can't state a claim with no proof then tell me to prove your proof if wrong.
---
1.  Get it running.
---
2.  Get it stable.
---
3.  Check a million tiny things to make sure they are as accurate as possible.
---
They're on step 3.  This is exactly why they have beta.
---
Not doubting that, but that's kinda besides the point right now.
---
I was there it was great
---
Realm 15 was the shit!
---
It gave me what I'm making already on my first press.
---
Exactly. Most ppl did not learn English because they had nothing else to do, but because they wanted to communicate with the whole world.
---
Don't worry, you won't be allowed to use it in raids anyway.
---
I disagree on that last part. If its just one or two other people. You can invite them to a group. But when its 40 fighitng over 20 spawns. Even with a 5 man group, its going to take a while to snag the kills
---
with all complaints about layering, no way it's going to remain as is by launch. I'm not worried that game-breaking shit like this will be taken care of.
---
Usually being a beta tester doesn't involve delving into game files and compiling reports together with proofs like it's a medical research paper.
---
Layering involves an entire copy of the world, so it never could have only been in the starting zones.
---
Vast majority of players won't want to walk to their dungeon just to be ganked 100 times either but the entire point of classic is the difficulty and struggle we gave up for convenience which lead to retail wow
---
But what if your friend is on a "layer" that's full. They'd have to hard cap it otherwise it's just another name for a server.
---
Act like you hate blizz, and I'm going to call it that way. We don't know on the phases, and you are as likely to be right as I am. But the idea that layering would be used in that way ignores the reason it is there in the first place.
---
It is there to avoid server merges, period. This way they can have a smaller number of launch servers and as people leave condense those who are left into one normal population server. Layering won't be needed because by that point they can just use the normal server population caps (2500-3K) and use their old tricks (Free transfers to lower pop servers from packed ones) and queues to solve the few servers that are still overpopulated.
---
If they were being vague and refusing to answer straight questions I would understand, but they have been clear about it going away and I don't see them going back on that, the backlash would be a lot to deal with.
---
Yes, BlizzActivision isn't the best and I'm not keen on all the money grabs they're doing with Classic. Still, the MMO genre is dead and only an old game can get me excited about it again. I'll be playing, but I'm paying with commission/work gift card money so it makes me feel *slightly* better. I'll drop this shit as soon as it's not fun anymore, but maybe Blizz will take a hint with Classic's success.
---
&gt; d I can't stand the thought of someone abusing a system for a couple of days in order to ensure the other 99% have more fun and a greater desire to stick around. 
---
Most of us are in it for the nostalgia, hard to get much more nostalgic than camoing the same quest mobs with 60 other people.
---
They only have 2 months what will they do! Take a chill pill chicken little.
---
No, Tauren Hunters have a bigger deadzone than all the other Hunters. And it's because of hitboxes, not leeway.
---
Yep, it's pretty disconcerting to say the least.
---
I had 300Kbps in TBC, latency is what gets ya, down-speed, not so much.
---
Hi there.   
---
Thanks for the massive upvotes on this, it's way more than I expected. Westfall was more of a nostalgic project because in all honesty, the zone isn't really competetive compared to Loch Modan and Darkshore. I did it anyway because there will be many people playing Human and therefore also visiting Westfall.
---
I would like to take the opportunity to clear some things up and give advice.
---
First things first, goint into Westfall at level 11 has one purpose and one purpose alone. Avoiding competition as fast and as much as possible. Leaving the starting Zones is always priority number one. Westfall is like I said not really competetive and many people do know this which is also why especially Loch Modan is flooded around 10-13. Elwyn Forest is also a hard bottleneck so where do you actually go?   
---
Westfall does appear as an alternative all of a sudden. Westfalls biggest weakness is the heavy reliance on grinding between quests, which in a competetive Server launch enviroment lessens this effect. 
---
The first circle is in this Situation a big plus, as you will get everywhere something you need. Compared to Modan and Darkshore it's a good advantage because they are funneled into a tighter area.
---
Unfortunately, Westfall is also a bad Zone to level in because the Monsters you are facing are too strong in some Areas for what they reward you with. The Part 2 and 3 of The Peoples Militia are a good example for that. 
---
So to whom would I recommend Westfall? I would recommend it to experienced Players who can avoid Elwyn/Dun Morogh as fast as possible and in the best Case are a Mage,Warlock,Hunter or Priest with a good Wand. I would like to mention here that Westfall offers incredible many AOE spots. So if you are able to do it, it can provide some unseen Potential. If you do actually come from Dun Morogh with level 12 or even 13, Westfall is also a lot easier solo. Last but not least would I recommend Westfall to any group playing player, as you will negate the downsites of Westfall much more easily and can potentially gain advantage over a technically more effective Zone where players do bottleneck each other. Once you gained the exp from here you have the option to take advantage of the better zones where players aren't yet able to compete because of the level difference. 
---
This of course is theory. Always keep in mind that traditionally Human is the most played Race in the Alliance.
---
&gt; A VERY good speed run to 60 is still over 5 days /played.
---
How quickly people forget the slow burn nature of vanilla WoW...
---
Pure dps classes, especially ranged dps would benefit the most. But really almost everyone could do some cool stuff except... 
---
Druid (and despite other comments)  paladin would benefit by far the least. Both of those classes need vastly different gear for each spec and the specs mostly don't synergize. Giving repentance to a holy pally is not nearly as good as giving a destruction warlock soulink and siphon, etc.
---
1.8 was the melee normalization patch. 1.10 was hunters. I don't know what you mean by mut ? Mutilate maybe ? That was added in tbc lol. But yeah I don't think hemo was normalized.
---
French have better English than Hungary according to your map. Now where is my Hungarian client and server? Nowhere. I learned English if I wanted to play WoW, just as french will learn English if they want to play classic.
---
Looks like that guy just killed you.
---
Call me crazy, but I don’t think a crosshair is the biggest priority right now.
---
This is a good point. I think people dedicated to finding all potential bugs on the beta should be given access. They should also get some sort of notes on changes made until 1.12 if documented internally in order to possibly find more bugs like this.
---
The minimum range for ranged weapons is way more than 8 yards in the beta. So this makes the dead zone really big. 
---
See it here: https://m.twitch.tv/perplexitycya/clip/DeadTiredHareOhMyDog
---
The general consensus is that Hunters are screwed in pvp.
---
In other words, this is big fucking deal. Potentially game changing from perspective of beta testers. It seems to me big enough to warrant reseting the entire leveling experience and pushing back release date.
---
Smart.
---
You do realize layers are just servers within servers, right? You don't actually think blizzard invented next gen server tech that can just magically multiply without requiring the same resources of a normal server? 
---
Having enough layers to accommodate the player pop is the same exact thing as just having enough servers, layers aren't magic.
---
Aren't there rules about Germany taking things over?
---
The intercept macro worked in Classic. It was of course scripted differently, but it still worked.
---
True, but this may cause Blizzard to do some internal testing on spells at least, though I don't think spells really went through much normalization like melee weapons did.
---
Still, they're could be non damage related issues stemming from the Legion client that this may have brought internal attention to.
---
Then you just move the huge bottleneck to The Barrens or Westfall. 
---
New people play for a day or two with the couple hundred people in their zone, then are shifted into a wasteland where there's queues for mobs, since there's thousands of people competing for maybe 60 boars that never drop a liver.
---
You think he was just spitballing that? You really think that’s the first time they said what they were planing on doing? Where is it lacking proof? He literally says why and how they were going to use it.
---
Well, they weren't in vanilla.
---
Because this is minor compared to other things? Its called priorities mate
---
I love this, where do I sign
---
It’s not the most devastating factor. Not by a long shot.
---

---
surprised priests are so high. People don't typically like playing as healers who kill things slowly.
---
Not in that place like that where you step outside IF and suddenly see people. I have gone out there plenty of times during vanilla and you could always see the duelers hanging out as you came round the corner of the tunnel.
---
look how they massacred my boy
---
Those are the alliance players trying out horde.
---
I agree with you but to be entirely fair Scandinavians have an edge over, say, frenchies when learning English not only because of it being taught at school early on, but because y'all languages are so close to English anyway
---
You can make more realms if it's very popular.
---
Merging many realms if it's unpopular gets people pissed.
---
Nice idea, I don't want to play with migrant supporter pride dancers from west either.
---
This is feedback.
---
Lol yea no shit, but if the launched without fucking layers they have no plans of merging servers. Therefore the people asking for just no layering don't understand that blitz is going to launch with 20 servers in na and there will be 100k people on each server so you will be completely fucked trying to level. If your going to make a stupid fucking comment about how tech world at least read what we are talking about.
---
I got a green +1 stamina sword in teldrassil and it felt fucking amazing.

His delts look really weak and flat.

So what do you want? The hardcore players merged together with another server? So their server first 60/Rag kill means shit because there's 2/3/4 of them now?
---
No option has nothing but good outcomes.

this comment really needs to be green

I'm not sure what you mean by spell normalization at all tbh. I'm all for them looking at things and fixing things, but let's not start listing things without knowledge to back it just because something else was wrong.
---
Look for problems, test them and compare... Asking them to look at spell normalization which didn't even exist is kind of just throwing spaghetti at the ceiling fan.
---
Wow Blizzard will use any excuse to nerf warriors and rogue huh? What's next I wonder. Stupid stupid stupid
---
Lol how totally blind and childish do you have to be to not realize that merging dead servers is almost the exact same thing as merging dead layers except merging dead servers won't be 7x more detrimental to the economy as merging dead servers would be not to mention the vanilla killing aspect of phasing
---
&gt; For instance in France you can perfectly live your entire life without needing to know any English
---
Except if you want to play Classic lol

Straight from the designer himself.

So who gets the original name they created? The person first? The person second? Or are both forced to change. Seems kinda fucked.
---
You don't know better than anyone else how hardcore the classic community is, and will continue not to know until classic is released.
---
same reason everyone thinks the world is flat, can you tell us why you think that? real reasons only please i'm not trying to argue just figure it out
---
the layering tech is fucking retarded.
---
Fire mages are very fun to level if you can twink them. Much like destro locks they melt faces incredibly quick with good gear.
---
Because people love to harp on the most popular issues and not understanding the game is in BETA and still has 2 months to go.  Expect to continue seeing this well into classics launch.
---
You're arguing with a brick wall at this point. People will believe exactly what they want to believe.
---
Literally everything we know is "there are layers in beta" and "the devs promised to remove layers after a few weeks", but of course people have to extrapolate from that. One of the responses above simply dismisses the quote from the dev. Well, if you're not going to believe a dev saying they literally promise something, then there's no point having any discussion about what they're going to do.
---
I love it!!
---
What an asshole, posting the progress of a fix after business hours on a Friday...
---
no, what I mean is that players on all sides will get frustrated trying to communicate with huge enclaves of players who do not speak their language and the result will be a mess of factionalism, xenophobia etc.
---
Can they have seperate realms where layering is enabled and some where it is disabled so people can pick what experience they want? And then merge them a month later. (Ie: kelthuzad normal, kel thuzad layer) 
---
I for one do not care what other people do. I care about having fun with my friends in the world that got me into gaming.
---
I might actually be a robot. Someone did tell me I was a good bit on Reddit a few days ago.
---
It's nice to see this kind of thing!
---
Disappointing that they still haven't addressed the serious, serious pet issues though.
---
Hmm.... my memory is too fuzzy to say for certain
---
You can abuse the economy with layering as well.
---
Okay, don’t play them.
---
thats literally the opposite of what layering is
---
you people should actually read up on how layering works
---
Blizzard isn't doing the testing though, it's the players and this is something Blizzard should've noticed right at the beginning. They have access to all the files and code but they are lazy or don't care apparently.
---
"Well *I* don't want to wait in queues and *I* don't want to compete for tags because *I* deserve a struggle free level experience and *other* people's desire don't matter because *I* am more important"
---
You're literally doing the same thing, numbskull
---
If they announced it as part of a panel, then I'd agree with you. They were asked about it during a Q&amp;A and rather than dodge questions like retail and other developers, they answered with something. Their plan was hope no one brings it up, but if they do bring it up, this is our canned response. If they made a slide that said "We are sharding the starting zones to alleviate over crowding", they you'd have an argument. 
---
Also, the biggest part about this is they are allowed to change their mind. You are making this game. Reddit isn't making this game. Blizzard is. If they want to add laying and implement it permanently, it's their prerogative. Layering is the 100% correct decision business wise. Cheap to maintain, more happy customers, more monthly subscriptions. 
---
This is reddit trying to make mountains out of mole hills.
---
Let's learn esperanto.
---
I really hope they also fix the 1000 other hunter bugs prior to release. Pet AI is disgusting and painful to use, growl threat is way lower than vanilla, auto shoot animation has a bug where it gets delayed, pet armor talent doesn’t right now, there’s a rather large list
---

Assuming he will stream his leveling experience, it will stop people from rolling on his server for about 5 minutes.
---
I'm doing the same thing I do in retail. I'm available different days every week so I just find a role where I can fill in when I'm available. I'm also a healer so I'll get dungeon and pvp gear to offset it.

I respect the amount of work and effort that went into this and there is no way I could do better but man that shit looks funny as hell, lol!

Good work tho, honestly man... miles better than I (or anyone I know) could do!

It doesn't have to be really complicated to be useful, don't worry. Just build things that you find useful. As you get comfortable, you'll try more complicated things, learn new tools, then find new things you want to try.
---
This. I play on English server in vanilla with a lot of Hungarians. I still play on this realm and mostly talk with them. However I mostly play with internationals (even russians) in M+. Germans can have german guilds, and pug with other nationalities if there is no 40 germans up for raiding.
---
Why not start playing after a few weeks when layering gets turned off?
---
People forget how long classic leveling took. We're talking days of /played.
---
yeah, most people don't really understand how testing works either 
---
users whining about networking people rolling things out get no sympathy from me
---
OP: I definitely agree with your sentiment... this sub is way more fun when it's adding to my nostalgia and helping me pass the time to launch work a smile.  But I have to agree with this comment... the squeaky wheel is what gets real changes. If the community is very quiet and offers only mild concern, Blizzard may very well decide that they know what's best (or easy/profitable), and not address these issues, assuming fans will just deal.
---
I know these posts can be a little over the top, but a huge part of the vanilla experience was due to the subtle nature of player interaction, and things like server language and layering will have dramatic effects on that interaction. If I log into vanilla and find the same zero-chat questing and dungeon experiences as BFA, I won't stay long, and I will be sad.
---
What if those tourists would've stayed had they not had to camp a quest mob though?
---
I dont care how much the game cost. I'd pay more then 15 on release. But I agree that how they did this whole thing was scummy. They basically told people to gamble 15 bucks on beta access. This doesnt sit well with me and I never subbed for the gamble. 
---
On another note BFA is trash. Maybe fun for a month then find yourself logging in just to sit for moments before you log out. People are saying BFA still has loads of people playing but I believe the contemporaneous is just over 500k. Sure that's a lot of ppl but it just shows how many unsubbed if anything.
---
Good luck lol
---
"It's just a test" pepeLaugh
---
Alright let’s back up bud. Let me lay it out so maybe even you’re retarded brain can grasp it.
---
You’re argument is that the economy will be fucked by no lifers abusing layering. 
---
I responded by saying that’s a retarded reason for not wanting layering because no lifers will monopolize certain parts of the market regardless. 
---
You then responded by saying that’s a weak argument when I literally gave you a reason as to why you’re argument is fucking weak literally showing how weak it is by the way you responded.
---
You then gave no alternative argument meaning you believe the economy to be the biggest factor when considering layering.
---
If you gave me another reason besides that like maybe something like it ruins immersion and server cohesion/community then hey I might agree with you. But saying that the economy will be fucked by no lifers is hysterical considering the history of every game launch ever where no lifers always abuse markets and gain semi-monopolies and advantages. That’s literally the reason for no lifeing
---
Healers are much more fun, imo, in pve than their dps counterparts. Mages cast frostbolt in molten core. While dps rotations are definitely a thing, once you know the decision tree it's just following through with it. Healing means you are paying attention and adjusting on the fly and I prefer that playstyle. Sure leveling as a healer sucks, but spriest is pretty solid.
---
yes, all of them at once. because that's what layering is
---
Or picking herbs, oh yeah baby.
---
Lol ok
---
It’s amusing watching you be so confident about something you don’t understand.
---
I really want to play Shaman but I don't wanna heal.
---
I think it's a bit BS though that ignite keeps refreshing itself whenever someone crits. So it just keeps growing and growing as long as people crit.
---
Summoning requires being in a group. Groups are placed in the same layer.
---
I agree that layering has problems, but please don't be retarded about it.
---
Only certain keys trigger the keyring I believe....
---
It's neckbeard envy.
---
I endorse this plan wholeheartedly and see absolutely nothing that will go wrong.
---
They'll learn australian or they'll quit the game, and honestly that's fine by me.
---
I concur. I suspect because legion normalization was used this may imply  a template was used in the port from the original engine to the classic engine.  I suspect a number of modifiers were inadvertently overridden because the later expacs had priority.
---
If I get the ignite and keep it until I pull aggro and die. Who gets the aggro from the ignite if it continues to roll? As long as there's a crit within 4 seconds the ignite will never fall off. And who gets the damage?
---
The problem is with your B) option where you said "everyone knows the risks and rewards".... sooooooo many people wont know
---
I’m going to macdonalds y’all want anything
---
I wish they’d respond to people abusing layering so easily

Hunter's are just screwed in general...

There is no "merging layers" as far as the economy goes. As usual with the anti-layering people, that just shows that you don't actually understand how layering works or what effects it'll have on a server's economy. Everyone on a server will operate in the same auction house, the number of layers has absolutely no impact there.
---
Or play retail where there's no such thing as being on a PvP server anymore.
---
Seriously... when I left, everyone on a PvP server was flagged for PvP except in certain areas. Everyone on PvE servers could select whether to be flagged or not.
---
Now everyone can select whether to be flagged via warmode... soooo... every server is a PvE server.
---
Uh oh, is there such a list for english or - international - guilds? Asking so I can avoid a few.
---
you dont get it. this is what every one of you stress testers say. every single one of you that post here. its nostalgic idiocy and the "i want to be part of the hype". thats all. because its really not amazing to kill some boars. its next level hyperbole
---
jUST gET AhEAd oF tHe PaCk
---
None of the people bitching have any solutions, and if blizzard decides to ditch layering at launch for some reason, they’ll be here crying because they took a week off work and couldn’t get out of the starting zones.
---
Check the useful druid macros page on Wowpedia for some ideas. They won't transfer 1:1, but they're a great start.
---
I have things like a travel macro that automatically picks the the right form. It looks like this, though mine has more bells and whistles:
---
/use [mod:ctrl]&lt;mount&gt;;[swimming] Aquatic Form; [outdoors] Travel Form
---
They already do this, the mods from WOW have infiltrated this sub and its pretty much wow now instead of classic wow.
---
You are correct. The keys that go on the keyring are permanent to your character IIRC.
---
They like open doors, not chests. It's you opening something for good versus opening it once.
---
i mean if somene is there just sitting there constantly killing you from rezing isnt that player harassment
---
1.  Blizzard *is* doing testing.
---
2.  Players *are* doing testing; that's what beta is for.
---
3.  You don't understand what a huge project this is.
---
How are they supposed to notice "right away" that instant attack damage is 2% different than their reference?  Really?  *That* is what they're supposed to catch right away?  You totally misunderstand the scope of the project.  Did you even look at the number ranges here?
---
    Expected range (3.3): ~413-471
---
    Expected range (3.6): ~427-486
---
    Measured range: 428-484
---
See that measured range?  This is what you expected them to catch "right away"?  They "don't care" because they didn't notice that damage was 2% off?
---
These GOT &amp; Classic Wow Memes are on point man!

There's also the option of the original sharing system just for the start zones and/or level 15~ then kill it off after a suitable timeframe

I dare you to go to a party and speak in twitch emotes without coming across as a massive sperg.
---
That's cool, I wish I had a strong enough inclination for one particular class to make me feel that way. 
---
I think most people asking these sort of questions don't have a strong inclination for any particular class so we focus on things like representation, damage rankings and raid demand to help us decide.
---
We can name the layering Classic Wow.
---
We can name the non layering: Classic Classic Wow (You know what we mean.)
---
Obviously the Australian server will be named China anyways.
---
God I understand the frustration of streamers, but this is cringe. He obviously is surprised by it shifting him to another layer in the video. Stop the incessant hate of streamers. If anything, this is bringing attention to blizzard that layering needs to go.
---
There are already 20 languages in English servers. There is not much xenophobia there. Just because Blizz adds 3 other languages to the pool it won't change much. (maybe in the beginning but not in the long run) In most of the big games all EU already plays together. (LoL, Dota, Overwatch, Starcraft etc. and virtually all of the multiplayer games)
---
You're right on all counts, good job! I was re-writing that macro while on break at work, as a proof of point, but I thought there were more optimizations that could be done.
---
They'd better start practicing shouting CROIKEY!
---
When you use the terms "we are looking into", you aren't 100% running with that idea. That's one of the ideas you have. But you have others. Reddit and you seeming latched onto this as absolute law and are trying to leverage this against them. They didn't plan on talking about sharding. They were asked about it during a Q&amp;A but had a plan of something to say about it if they did get asked about it. How about you get off your high horse and don't assume because they mentioned one thing when asked that they can't change their mind about it.
---
Eh, if that's what breaks the magic of Classic for them, they might as well throw in the towel. There's a lot more inconveniences in the game than that.
---
Ya. Multiple use keys, not one time use for a quest etc
---
can anyone explain to me what layering is?
---
I think it looks great.
---
You are exactly doing it right! Next step: add in your buff spell so people know who gave them it.
---
Why doesn't anyone complain about the unkillable priest bug when it's been in the game just as long any problems with Layering?
---
There's no reason to suspect Blizzard won't be changing the ruleset to changing Layers to prevent the abuse people are so worried about. It's clearly a work in progress. Let them work.
---
The platform in the UC throneroom does it too which is super weird
---
You guys just be fun to be around.
---
This is a 15 year reboot for gods sake.
---
do you think having access to code is a magic do anything button? If you want to complain about implementation, but you shouldn't kid yourself into thinking you, or anyone here is actually capable of coming up with a viable solution just from being a user in a game 
---
you guys are suggesting changes to a system that are impossible while actually keeping it the same system. You want the load balancing software to somehow, only separate the starting zones, but keep the rest of the zones in the same "instance". Well, if you want that to happen, you're going to have to implement load screens between the starting zones and every other zone in order to make that happen. That has even MORE ramifications because you need to pass through the starting zones for a majority of flight paths 
---
You cant have your cake and eat it too.
---
Well some mobs drop consumable keys too I think. Some dude in the Kul Tiran keep in Durotar. Opens his chest, I think it's consumed but tbh I deleted it during the stress test lol.
---
It's always been cynicism.
---
You can go join the European on the Aussie servers.
---
Yea they must, why else would they spend all the money to release it?
---
10 Mbps is fine for online gaming, however, you can't be downloading anything massive or streaming HD videos alongside the game without potentially incurring bandwidth issues and lag spikes.
---
You're not even willing to give people a chance to like get to know and enjoy the game?
---
How exactly are you not doing the EXACT same thing you are criticizing OP for doing? Aren't you LITERALLY stating that "I'm fine with the negative aspects of layering so all the people that aren't can go fuck off".
---
Your verbose, purple, and gold baiting writing is very nauseating to read btw.
---
There aren't going to be any Aussie servers.
---
Ya, it opens the chest atop the keep. Benedicts key I think it is
---
Yes, but novelty to *whom*? People who have been playing this game for their entire lives, unwilling or incapable of realizing that maybe its time to move on? Or losing its novelty because BfA is probably the worst expansions they've done so far? Or both?
---
Yeah that would fall under the "Layering done properly" category. We should focus our efforts on ensuring that layering is done well and how they said it would be done. Although I think they will need layering even past lvl 15.
---
Ok that one scenario wont happen but you haven't responded to the main point about it being exploited in many ways.  Secondly what if i want to be with the people i already know on the layer but also want to group with my friend that joined the server late and is on a different layer than me? i cant.
---
They should've just looked at the code man.
---
Not to be rude, but this is a stupid plan.
---
He also says "a few weeks in" which is not clear. We have no idea when it will end and we dont know what Blizz wants.  Likely they will play it by ear
---
My point is dont make factual statements based on guesses.
---
Perfect.
---
You got me totally the scope and discord I was aiming for. Damn now my cover is blown... now I’ve gotta change my feelings of nostalgia and topic to something new...
---
IRL world pvp would be taken too far too fast
---
its cause of their shitty layering code or whatever you wanna call it.
---
never
---
Right, I just don't know if it's consumed in doing so.
---
are you certain this syntax works in classic? because I would expect retail macros to be severely limited
---
What's wrong with people having options?
---
Gotta get ahead of the controversy lol.
---
Thank goodness, NOBODY has been posting simple solutions on this sub. We are dying for more of these posts.
---
Upvoted for good use of Latin
---
no one ever could
---
They won't since it's working as intended.
---
Realm 15 buy what layer bro?
---
But that’s the beauty of cultural enrichment, Europe lives for that
---
If you all join the same guild you will join the same layer as the guild master. Problem solved. As for the exploiting, people will exploit anything and everything, human nature. Blizzard can do other things in regards to this like merging layers sooner rather than later to minimize the impact of said exploits or even flag and ban peoples accounts that are aggressively exploiting this. No option is without its downfalls
---
It was
---
The stuff that I wrote in the OP (once shortened to meet the 255 character limit) does work in the Classic client*, as reported by people in this thread.
---
*The /petmoveto does not work, as noted in my edit.
---
Well the difference is they dont have a fix for layering yet, if they had a solid fix, that was in testing, they probably would.
---
Me neither
---
Honestly, this looks way more entertaining than an all English servers. Barrens chat could be an international treasure trove of scum and villainy with the added benefit of learning new ways of using using common every day insults. I see nothing but winning here
---
I only remember this happening in the major cities, and when you're going into a new zone...but with this layering code or whatever who knows what will happen.
---
First off I don’t have a problem with this and never said I did. I’m not trying to leverage anything. You are the one that seems to be on a high horse.  Everyone seems latched onto the idea cause that’s all we were ever told.  I never said they couldn’t change there mind. You asked where they initially said what they wanted to do with sharding and I gave you the answer.
---
You are right! There is absolutely no reason for me to pay for the same experience, that i can have on a p-server for free.
---
You mixed up the groups. No changes want layering and I'm not sure who doesn't want it.
---
&gt;not understanding the game is in BETA and still has 2 months to go
---
I thought this past 3 betas, then waited years for the game to finally integrate twitter as core functionality. At least it came!
---
This sums up layering pretty well.
---
Exactly
---
Why does the guy in the background have Cataclysm shoulders...?
---
I don't have beta to test, but if it did in original in 1.12(and it did), then it should.
---
Yes
---
I could be wrong, but they have "firs/fjers" which is 80 (4x20), and fems (5x10), but 90 would've been a half fems, which is between fems and firs
---
 ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
I honestly don't think they will if a *temporary* problem like lots of players turns them off of the game. Like I said, there's a lot of *non-temporary* inconveniences in the game that are worse than waiting on a spawn.
---
The beauty of it is, they can always come back when there isn't a launch going on and try the game at more reasonable starter zone population levels.
---
Very
---
Also Bobby B is a prodigious user of hammers
---
No, but it's how it worked according to Ion. So unfortunately it's set in stone.
---
ALL I WANTED TO DO WAS CRACK SKULLS AND FUCK GIRLS!
---
Honestly the Classic community in general is giving me second thoughts about playing at all. I feel like unmoderated private server cesspools have cultivated such toxic communities over the years that it has ended up infecting all Classic discussion forums. 
---
I will play Classic, but Blizzard needs to keep a tight leash on this shit. The real vanilla community was nowhere near this bad (as much as private server players insist it was.)
---
Took 2 weeks off for launch.  As for balance I will be pretty screwed for the first 2 months.  September to the end of October I have a seasonal 2nd job.  That means even though I will be one of the first 60 mage on my server I will then be unavailable for a set raiding group until after Halloween.  My plan is to develop some good relationships with people while leveling and try to be completely BIS pre raid by Halloween.  Then after hopefully find a guild that is in need of a mage.  
---
I also dont have much of a social life and will be able to commit to some pretty no-life raiding schedules after Halloween.
---
Well,  he did play in Vanilla so I kinda trust what he says
---
They didnt patch the one thing I noticed instantly, the sky is falling, the sky is falling!
---
lol, opinions are like but holes...
---
Pretty sure you could purge songflower.
---
She is never gonna get food with hand placement like that
---
Because they are fixing other more important issues?
---
\&gt; Should be easy to fix the animations, right?
---
Non-developers claim this about everything. It isn’t about ease. Its about resources and priorities.
---
Always that one pot head in the group slowly turning, doing 100 dps but happy as hell to just be there.
---
Yes you imbecile if you can't recall the hell classic advocates had to go through to get Blizzard to even consider classic wow it is safe to assume they still don't understand what makes the authentic MMO experience that vanilla wow engendered, these are the same people who said "you think you do but you don't"
---
oy vey
---
Site is a nightmare on mobile.  Will try on my PC later.
---
On point 3. Makes you wonder what else has possibly been missed...
---
Debuff-Slots perfectly used! :D
---
You have any examples to prove your point, or will you just wax woefully?
---
Did you escape from your mental institute? Should I alert the police? Please respond aptly
---
It's only for the first few weeks. What do you want? You're going to try and raise hell over something that's just a temporary measure and you'll never have to care about again after that?
---
While I agree, he’s taken a safe stance here. Just donate
---
Well its a good thing its 15 years later with better technology.
---
We still clean AQ40
---
Nice bait.
---
Fixing a broken formula is a tad easier than fixing layering
---
Or let’s stop being entitled babies and whining about any of the dumb shit you manchildren lose sleep over.
---
Calm down, I'm fine mate. Just dissapointed with Classic's development team.
---
Hey now, I rolled horde when I was 15 and I only hit 25 like 4 years ago which was still a decade after launch
---
It sounds like the words of a jaded fervent streamer groupie having the scales drop off his eyes and recognize streamers don't give a fuck about their viewers.
---
This is a troll account, nothing to see here.
---
haters gonna hate
---
???
---
He had me in the first half boys. They actually should cancel the development and just release the damn game so I can play it. As for the body of your post....

---
If I have the displeasure of being on a server with a streamer, every person I see in chat asking for an invite or anything related to the streamer will be /ignored.
---
Sharding is a technology used in retail WoW, it distributes players to different versions of zones based on local populations for zones on the same server, in an effort to balance players around and create smoother game experiences.
---
So basically if you are in layer 1 and get ganked you can ask for an invite for someone that is in layer 2,3,4 etc and you get phased in to that layer away from the people that tried to gank you
---
Where does he even mention A.V?
---
Who cares, layering is temporary.
---
Some of you people are extremely deluded if you dismiss the possibility that it could be in the game forever if the population never really goes down.  
---
At the very least, the possibility is that it can last entire phase 1, and how many months would that be?  Talk about the first impression for many being piss poor... they are disregarding the initial impact of the game's release as a selling point in favor of releasing fewer servers.
---
Jesus do you hate your jids?
---
Why would i bitch about that? Like thats some super petty shit to bitch about. If this system wasn't in for the first few months zones would be fucking packed beyond belief. All of you bitching about it are acting like its gonna be in the game for ever. Its the way it is now in beta... BETA shall i state again, to test how its gonna work. its a new system so it can be tweaked.
---
Yes. We should cater to casuals who will also complain about no LFG and flying mounts as well as the people who will abandon the game anyway instead of the people who will actually play classic wow in it's entirety who are worried about the detrimental effects layering would have on the health of the game
---
They absolutely should've given special access to credible testers to the old client (I know security issues probably would've precluded wider access). I mean, it's still not too late to do that...
---
if blizzard is consistent about one thing, it is money &gt; player experience.
---
Please, explain to me what I don't understand. You think it's possible to layer just the starting zones? Okay, let's pretend for a minute that's not a contribution of terms and you're using layering to refer to load balancing used in wow in general. Okay. Now. Let's move forward. How do you propose we do this?
---
Because a fundamental part of WoWs open world design is on consistent world with no load screens. If you want to just implement that stuff in the starting zones, how is it going to be handled when they leave? There is going to have to be a transition between the areas while it switches you from "layered" to not "layered", and thats going to require a load screen. Now, what happens when you take a flight path to stormwind or ironforge? Right, you'll go through a bunch of load screens through these now instanced areas because they need to keep the "layering" separate from everything else..now we're making changes to classic wow. Ignoring that slippery slope (which I don't think anyone here wants blizz to open the door to) now, how exactly ARE we going to handle the droves of people just passing out of the layered zones into the not layer zones? You're going to come across a few of the problems layering was created to accommodate. This is poorly thought out.
---
Like, layerings not perfect and people can bitch about it all they want. But please don't pretend that being a user on a video game makes you qualified to come up with solutions to technical problems you don't actually know enough about. Throwing around concepts like "just layer the starting zones" sounds good until you actually think it through.
---
is it though?
---
As noted by the first response to the Blue post asking when they’re going to fix a hunter pet bug.
---
Cant have horde in the guild too though.. If blizzard done realm merges instead no one is able to exploit that but with layering your opening so many opportunity's for millions of people to exploit which there's no way blizzard will punish everyone misusing the system. It took blizzard so many years for them to stop people using honorbuddy for example lol.
---
/cast [@cursor] Blizzard or flamestrike will immediatly cast the spell without the green circle.
---
Personal disagreement with layering is that you'll end up on 20k pop servers, good luck building a community off of that.
---
Blizzard tested 6 layers in the recent stress test.. so not sure why you think they wouldn't be trying to do as many as possible?
---
Then you aren't fine. The guys one that dev team are busting their ass to replicate this game the best they can. I think they are doing a fine job. Its not perfect but little in life is.
---
It’s not a bug. It’s how the system works. If you’re on layer 1 on character A and character B is on layer 8 when you log onto B and then back to A you’ll be on 8.
---
Probably a Hunter. He can one shot clothies with aimed shot at max distance.
---
But it was a *stress* test. The point was to put stress on the servers. It wasn't a "Launch Test".
---
If I don’t what other players..what? I’m opposed to layering. What are you talking about?
---
Will you be able to use this in classic?
---
The unsung heroes.
---
Well they are kind of running out of time at this stage.  The final stress test is the end of next month, and so far it has only gotten much worse with the major tests.  
---
Let us say, for the sake of argument, that the situation remains stagnant by the end of July... do you really think they'd be able to change anything at all in the weeks leading up to release without any further public testing?
---
Actually, no. The truth is that they're lazy pieces of shit who don't test things properly.
---
ALL THEY NEED TO DO IS TO REMOVE LAYERING OR GIVE A FIRM (2 week?) WINDOW FOR REMOVAL.  Then the hype will resume.  Layering as it is now is, without a doubt, incompatible with the genuine classic experience and will ruin the game.
---
No, classic would be a complete fresh start; but it would be cool!
---
LoL. WoW is a game. Why someone is more pathetic than you because he plays WoW differently than you?
---
Earthshaker proc rate should be high.  It did for me at least
---
I can understand being confused if you havent played retail in a decade or so, but currently if something is in place on a beta for WoW it is absolutely going to be that way when the game launches.
---
How will that collapse achieve vanilla population cap ~~3.5k? Layering inherently means you'll be playing on 20k pop servers.
---
Right, you will switch to a new layer and have new people on it. You shouldnt be doing this every week tho so it should be a one and done situation. Realm merges would cause a lot of other drama. Losing your name, your guild name, etc is very frustrating to some people. To each their own, you dont like it... i dont love it, but it is what is just live with it and move on
---
&gt; It does have sharding, which we've now seen is effectively the same thing.
---
(It's not the same thing.)
---
&gt;Blizz did server merges in the form of pvp battlegroups in classic.
---
(PvP Battlegroups aren't server merges.)
---
Until Phase 2 hits :)
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
I see you're trying to play the "Gotcha" game.  That's fun.
---
You heard the "a few weeks in" statement, but then missed the rest where he talked about how only one version of the world bosses(specifically quoted Kazzak ever) should exist per server.  "Or we have a second Kazzak, if we do that it's not classic." 
---
Look, Ion is a lawyer by education/profession prior to joining Blizzard so omitting the truth is part of his DNA at this point.  But all the info they have released has been relatively consistent.
---
I enjoyed arguing i  stormwind for 45 mins over whether it was VC or DM
---
I go through this cycle lol. I love playing with my friends they're hilarious and great, but I'm better at most games than them and sometimes it gets annoying having someone on your team that is 5-30. I never give them shit and honestly at times they get frustrated and are pretty critical of themselves.  
---
I also love to min max and play to the best of my ability, but they just like to relax not do any research and just sit down and play. So in some games I'll play with like minded people who try their hardest and are great at the game. What usually ends up happening however is I just don't enjoy the environment as much it breeds alot of toxicity and the comedy / friendliness is heavily lacking. So while the performance is 1000x better the fun is lacking.  
---
I think you should just figure out what works for you. Try playing without them or having multiple characters so you can play with them. Especially if they have no scheduled progression it'll probably be easy to catch up or stay with them on alts. Only way to figure out what works for you is to try all the different options.
---
Why do you and some others feel that it wont be?
---
Blizzard's track record begs to differ, and there is absolutely nothing leaning in favor of the optimistic outlook currently.  Blizzard is being rather silent on the entire issue itself and absolutely will not inform us what they are trying to incorporate into layering.
---
On private servers, ignite threat went to the mage who landed the ignite. There were some people who claimed that wasn't Blizz-like, and the threat should've been done differently, but I can't verify that.
---
That, imo, is a bug. Character A should remain on layer 1.
---
It's called humour.
---
0 points (8% upvoted)
---
Yup.
---
You are just being stupid at this point
---
Yea, and they only have one more stress test next month before the big testing is over... so um... point?  Time is ticking, and things have only gotten worse each major test.
---
I agree with you and will be rolling a priest on day one. Im just surprised that others are seeing the priest as an appealing class too, considering people normally gravitate to classes that can produce the biggest damage numbers.
---
What do you mean?
---
I didn't dismiss anything, I simply stated facts.  
---
If you, or I, or anyone else don't believe what they've already said then there's precisely nothing they can say that is going to magically make you believe them.
---
NO.  This was not how it was -- this is sharding, pure and simple -- Blizzard FUCKED THE GAME.
---
What pet issue? Wrong attackspeed?
---
Yes, but they only have one stress test left at the end of next month, and so far things have only gotten worse.
---
Ok, thanks for your input
---
7x the sources as the original vanilla servers doesn't effect the economy huh... I think it's YOU that doesn't understand elementary functions of economy, you know... supply and demand. Merging 2 dead servers would be effectively 5x less damaging to the economy, shared auction house or not
---
This happiness was short lived.
---
So you respond with the same wrong answer as someone else over an hour after they already responded, challenged me to disproof your lack of proof, and I'm on a high horse. Lol fuck off
---
You leaving, right?
---
Dynamic respawns mean I can stand in 1 spot. unmoving. And just chain kill mobs at 4-5 per minute (then spend 5 mintues every 5 levels finding new mobs) and level up in 3 days.
---
It's the height of being a shaman imo
---
Every spec is viable in pvp. 
---
Go Tauren though. Warstomp is underrated as hell for a shaman. 
---
And you lookin good in raid sets
---
That was due to low view distances on shitty old computers.
---
Sounds like someone is Jelly of Ion being a Scarab Lord, founder of Elitist Jerks, and being a contemporary mythic raider while going on to achieve his dream to work at Blizzard.
---
NO.  This is incorrect.
---
They've already said that layering is done at a world level, not a zone level. So they can't just turn off layering when you walk into STV if it's on in Elwynn.
---
In terms of why it's likely to be turned off after a few weeks/months though, even if there is no attrition of players, the simple fact is that classic is huge and the scope for difference among players after a week of release is massive.
---
Even if 30,000 people roll characters on day 1, by day 7 you're going to have a real diversity in levels, locations and playstyle. There'll be some hammering the grind, others burning through quests, or dungeon grinding, playing low level pvp. Some will be working 9-5 and playing in the evenings, some will take time off and hit it 18 hours a day, some will just play weekends, or in the middle of the night. Some will be level 50 hitting up Un'goro, Felwood or Western Plaguelands, while others will be at level 30 still kicking it in Thousand Needles, Desolace or Arathi Highlands. More still will be having fun in their 20s, running SFK for Arugals loot, or pvping in Hillsbrad or Ashenvale. And then there's the people who'll get to level 10/20 and suddenly decide they didn't actually want to be a Warrior/Alliance/Troll and roll a Warlock/Horde/Dwarf instead, or whatever.
---
You get the idea.
---
They've said explicitly that layering is intended to help launch.  When nearly all those people are likely to login for the first time, in one of 6 zones in the world, within 24-48 hours. 
---
Until they give us reason to believe they've changed their mind on this, why get yourself riled up?
---
Ah, yes *sips wine* these cretins will never understand the refined taste of talking about Chuck Norris in Barrens chat. They simply cannot comprehend the intelligent discord of my authentic vanilla experience. Dare I say, stream man bad? *laughs in boomer*
---
Ok, but phase 1 could last several months (possibly more if they want to account for average leveling times).   
---
That is kind of a long time and way past the impressionist phase of the game.
---
Why wouldn't blizzard just make enough servers to accommodate the population like they even said they would in interviews instead of just making 20 servers
---
Unlikely as leeway is not a bug but an intentional mechanic. There'd have to be a big stink from the community over it.
---
there is not a single game that hasn't declined from its peak, not one
---
wow has been declining in players steadily since wrath or so, legion was considered better than wod and yet it kept the trend, there's no disputing that they aren't making games as good as they did tho
---
&gt; It's annoying but very playable for for the first day.
---
Sauce please? Because I, for one, did not enjoy spending 8 hours getting to level 10 because of a 10,000 player launch.
---
That sounds like it could be clever for a dueling build, half for the "what in the tarnation?" factor.
---
You do realize that there's only 7x the resources when there's 7x the population, right? Empty shards aren't just sitting there and there'd be no way to get to them if they were. The increased supply will be met with evenly increased demand.
---
For majority of his tenure at Blizzard, Ion has been involved in raid design, and that one particular thing - together with art design - has been a constant enormous success.
---
I am sure this did not happen in vanilla.  Duelers were clearly visible from the gates.  Everyone else saying anything different is lying and trying to cover up the shit talking about layering.
---
I didn’t read anyone else’s response. And if my answers wrong then please show us the right answer. If I am wrong then you must know the correct answer. So where is it?
---
&gt; How many of those 10k players will hit 60?
---
Four.
---
You realize Twin Emps died the first week AQ40 gates opened? World buffs were **unnecessary** and mostly unreliable because guilds were learning the fights, dying, then killing bosses in the same raid nights.
---
Even my mid-tier guild killed Twin Emps the first month on our 12th attempt of the night.
---
&gt;	Maybe they did in Naxx but no one did Naxx at a statistical level... So was world buff stacking actually in Vanilla?
---
Yes, we did use World Buffs in Naxxramas, mostly on roadblocks like Patchwerk or Loatheb, which were mostly DPS checks.
---
Think about how easy most Vanilla raid bosses were. Once you had 40 people who knew the mechanics and could execute without fucking up, bosses died pretty quickly. Learning the mechanics means wipes, which means lost world buffs.
---
Even before Naxx, our guild used the Ony buff in Molten Core, and Ony+ZG+DM on Nefarian. Neither of which were necessary, but they added hype to those first kills.
---
&gt;	They removed it in TBC because it was discovered formally.
---
It wasn’t “discovered” in TBC for the reasons mentioned above. They removed them because it was dumb to have people running L60 raids and getting those buffs to do TBC progression.
---
No, this is incorrect.  This did not happen in the way demonstrated.
---
No, just sharing my shitty opinion.
---
Has blizzard responded on leeway yet?  Do we know if this is working as intended?
---
I kind of alluded to that with my comment. Maybe I should've been more direct.
---
The good: They didn't ignore this, they commented quickly, they assured a fix.
---
The bad: Radio silence on shardi- I mean, layering.
---
Idk where the misconception that it's not copyright infringement unless you're profiting comes from but it's 100% wrong. This dude should be selling his hard work until and unless he gets a cease and desist letter.
---
No, this is incorrect.  This is due to layering, not draw distances and lag.
---
Legion was far better than WoD, but it had terrible launch, and a lot of players, myself included, have quit before first patch came around.
---
It’s missing good music. /trollface
---
Sorry couldnt resist.
---
The game is currently in beta, not live. They're releasing constant bug fixes and there's great communication from the dev team
---
Your gut is wrong.
---
Ya, it is interesting to see how many people have different memories of what did or didnt happen
---
Because the population is going to fluctuate a fuck ton from launch to 2 or 3 months in and making a ton of servers will result in a bunch of dead servers
---
It’s a fucking crying shame
---
We're right around 1/3 of the way through the beta. Still time to catch things like this.
---
No... they said it could be a few weeks or up to the entire phase 1, but has to be removed by phase 2 (so they claim) due to world boss releases.  
---
So enjoy a few months worth of layering, because the only way they drop it in a few weeks is if the game loses a massive chunk of its playerbase in less than a month.. lets be a bit realistic here.  
---
Even if an mmorpg sucks, it generally doesn't lose more than half its playerbase in a single month because there will always be a stream of people purchasing the game to try it for a while.
---
Wow you must be an idiot
---
Damn I haven’t seen this comic in aaaaages, I think it was on the WoW official site back in the day.
---
I had a blast. I made some friends just in those two days and we are pumped for August.
---
The first few hours were rough but we planned and left northshire early and leveled off trash mobs and exploring.
---
We eventually got to 15, made an attempt at VC (which fell apart because a player hit need on every single item) and had a blast. We are very pumped
---
I was so happy to play it again. The servers weren't perfect but that's why they did the test in the first place. Everything past northshire was awesome.
---
I was trying to help someone make a weapon swap macro for ambush when you have a Main Hand sword equipped.
---
I don't currently have a client to test in and we couldn't get the syntax correct.
---
server 3 had a giant fire elemental, just posted a video regarding it. Neat how each server had a different mob
---
No, I'm staying just to annoy you guys.
---
Pretty sure it actually did happen in vanilla as the cities were like instances.
---
Lok'tar Ogar!
---
Which is 100% not what has happened here.  This is not due to draw distances and lag, this is due to "layering" aka sharding aka crossrealm.
---
Same here man.
---
Welcome to the age of instant gratification.  So many people are unwilling to wait 2-3 days, and would rather the rest of us wait 1-3 months (assuming Blizzard doesn't shoehorn layering in forever in some way).
---
I feel you.
---
Amen JFC.
---
Temper your expectations dude. All we can ask for is a best effort. At worst, it's still going to be more accurate than the frankenstein code built in Siberia that private servers used.
---
Exactly. It's not a permanent thing is my point. It's just to tame the population when the game launches while still providing experience of free flowing leveling till it settles. I think its reasonable. As long as they take off layering entirely after the phase.
---
The entire frickin point of layering is that it is SERVER WIDE.
---
Man, if more people actually understood that they can't phase out individual zones, maybe the uproar would be far more massive than it currently is.
---
When you die you are removed from the mob's threat table. So your dot will not generate threat, however combat logs should still read it as your ability.
---
I'm 100% sure that's not correct.
---
Again. You want me to prove that they didn't say something. If you want me to show you nothing, look right here -&gt;|        |. There ya go. Nothing. Exactly what they committed to.
---
Soulfly - Jump the fuck up
---
They have been for over a month, and they only have one more stress test at the end of July.... it has only gotten worse and they keep testing MORE layers, not less.
---
I'd be interested to see how they collected their data. If it's just from users performing speed tests then it will be basically useless as the vast majority of users wouldn't even know how to perform a speed test.  
---
Australia had woefully inadequate internet.
---
hashtag nobody cares
---
I noticed you are spending tons of time posting about layering. Just want you to know that layering is not a permanent feature, just something for the initial rush. After playing the stress test, even layering probably wont be enough to be enjoyable for the first dozen levels. For reference, I am not talking about having to wait to do a quest, I'm talking about every single mob having someone camping it's respawn across the entirety of Elwynn. While this is a slight exaggeration, it wasn't that far off either. Yes to layering, for the first couple weeks.
---
Im thinking about this alot, but i also know that if i dont roll a ret paladin; ill be forever sad xD
---
Hunter is also a pretty good choice in that regard. 
---
Their pvp and pve spec is pretty much the same early on when you still need the hit from surefooted. Even after that the dps difference is not that high.

I wouldn't presume to call it "my map" obviously, but Hungarians also make up less than 3%. I don't think it benefits anyone being stubborn over this. Personally, I did benefit a ton from learning English through WoW I'll grant you that. Still, I've never once joined an insular community, have had no wish to do so and from personal experience big populations like this will seek them out and form them in MMOs which simply alienates other players. 
---
I don't see any benefit in forcing anyone to go against their will so they struggle communicating in a social game. Those that want to speak English will regardless, those that won't often still refuse.
---
Good music
---
might want to get off this subreddit then, you might feel that way but none of us do and feel genuine joy doing small things in wow, you dont get to dictate whats fun for other people
---
These things aren't even remotely similar if you have the ability to think
---
I need to get macros this time around. Haven't played in a year, but when i do play wow, it kills my hands (arthritis)
---
The amount of people saying "I didn't see an issue with layering until" in this video is fucking astounding, it's literally a graphic example of why anti-vaxxers, flat earthers and other MORONIC groups of people exist.
---
They had TONS OF EXPLANATION from TONS OF SOURCES, giving a CLEAR example on why layering is an issue, which explained THIS EXACT SITUATION, just that not visually, what did they choose to do? say "oh it's not an issue, it doesn't affect gameplay", now it goes live and they're like "oh... so that's what they mean".
---
Why do people give their stupid fucking opinion if they don't understand what they just were told? Reminds me of that story of the mom that stopped being an anti-vaxxer after all her children got meassles, goddamn morons.
---
Holy shit this comment is a literal portal to what classic was like. Bug fixes everywhere and here. Here it is. The comment that always would show up. Would you look at that?
---
I don't see live to win!
---
My guess is they are going to find more anomalies that eventually lead to dungeons feeling hard like they used to
---
You are, because I remember having to fall into the lava below to get hurt.

Care to bring a holy pal?

yikes at the maga spam.
---
Username checks out.
---
You asked for their initial plan of sharding. We showed you the answer the devs gave of what they had an idea of where they were going with it. You still asking for something that’s been given to you.  Nobody here is claiming that they said it was going to be final and that’s what was going in at launch.  We are showing you what they originally said. Not what they said was final. If you can’t accept that it’s your fault.
---
https://youtu.be/oCIo4MCO-_U?t=4
---
They've said it wont exist in phase 2. Phase one could be months long.
---
Hunters, 11 yard dead zone confirm.
---
Should be 8 yards.
---
Wanna raid,pvp and farm with the same spec? Roll a healer
---
Even if you're correct (which you aren't btw, what happens when 1 layer reaches it's soft cap? The remainder, a small handful of players will be transfered to layer 2 which will be virtually empty), the entire fucking purpose of layering is based on the assumption that the population will drastically decrease and the need to merge dead layers will be inevitable. Knowing that, surely you can see that 7x the supplies for a server that is planned to have all it's layers merged after phase 1 will have a truly fucked up economy? Merging 2 dead servers will have a way smaller impact on economy than merging 7 dead layers
---
WEED = LOVE. WEED + WOW = LOVE LIFE
---
Giant failure of a stress test.
---
Worst time to let players play it - and some servers were near dead feeling.
---
I do know I’ll be playing horde - because I levelled two toons and alliance was the only side that never respected the “don’t touch the chest” and “don’t tag my mobs”  rule.
---
Some alliance players would wait for me to die to then steal the kill on a kill quest.
---
Just inv or accept my inv, you prick.
---
Horde was fantastic - super chill and outgoing for eachother.
---
Dude even invited me to a group to tag a rare mob and died for waiting for me to tag it.
---
I gave him a wand, a chest I found close by and 30 mage waters in return.
---
He made me a new chest piece in return.
---
You just don’t get shit like that on alliance.
---
Well, it's not going to blow then out of the water *per server* which is what we're talking about. The most populated pservers had 10k+ people online at a time, Classic won't be even close to that number per server. It's easy for Devilsaur and such - only enable it on normal mobs and named quest mobs - not rare elites, not elites.
---
Lol I play just as well high as I do sober, but I’m a long time stoner
---
I wish I could be that optimistic.
---
I spent years in WoW trying to find what I actually loved playing til I played Enhance in Cata I believe. Was my main ever since. Vanilla enhance however is just way too immobile and gets kited too easily for me to bear. They are also never going to be taken in any decent pve group.
---
That chat tho...
---
I mean yes, it would be very obvious very quickly. Target dummy tests with a damage meter and identical gear sets/talents. You’d pick it up immediately and prove it in about 5 minutes with access to both clients.
---
Were they testing the structural integrity of the Org Banks roof?
---
I too told a joke
---
What other problem is there? If Blizzard plans to turn off layering in the first weeks/months, their servers are going to have to handle the high population anwyay. Sure, more people in total will play Classic, but there will be far less *per server* as Blizzard won't have 10k-15k people online at one time on a server, the caps are going to be much lower than that.
---
&gt; Everything you said is true for every language and country in Europe. 
---
Are you being purposely factitious? Clearly, no, what I said does not go for every country in Europe. It's not a mandatory, heavily focused main language. Again, 49% of adult Europeans *don't speak the language*. 
---
&gt; I appreciate you finding sources for an entire essay of an answer but you're missing the point entirely
---
See, maybe I just don't get it but to me having discussions and discourse about elements that will impact everyone playing this game are important enough to at least take 5 minutes to look at the statistics instead of having ignorant knee-jerk reactions. 
---
&gt; French, German, Spanish and Italian aren't special. If everyone else can play on English servers, so can they.
---
Obviously they aren't special. I don't think anyone is calling them special. But it's important to recognize that English isn't as commonplace as some people seem to think and I don't see why you should *force anyone playing/paying for a social game to alienate themselves or others*. Because that's the reality of the situation. These are massive populations where English is low, they'll form insular communities as they've always done (and those that will want to speak English will do so regardless). Implying Blizzard is going to enforce an "English-only" rule will be highly unlikely at best.

This, I didn't have a taste in music until sophomore year of high school

That's what I recall as well.
---
It's actually pretty fucking easy if you hamstring kite and know which weapons to get. But let's hear some more melodrama please
---
I'm going rogue because it's the only class I never got to 60 besides paladin. Horde ftw.
---
I leveled a warrior and couldn't do a rogue.... like wtf is wrong with me. 
---
My friend let me play his decently geared rogue in vanilla/tbc and i loved every second of it.  
---
I played enhancement for all of vanilla. My guild let me raid as enhance, which I tried on a pserver and it was pretty frustrating to say the least, and it was a lot of fun.  
---
If you don't treat windfury as you're only strat... your shocks do insane damage and you can heal... you literally have the best spell in the game, which is grounding totem... if you don't believe me... just wait until you absorb these 3 minute mages double pyros and then purge arcane power... it's intoxicating. 
---
As you can see I also love shaman... but carrying around so much gear all the time was a pain.  Some people didn't even go engineering,  so not everyone had all those extras as well.
---
layering or phasing or w/e you wanna call it. It being in the game as opposed to individual servers will make me absolutely not play wowclassic.
---
But then it just wouldn't be a classic playlist.
---
I think the resolutions were just higher
---
How much did you pay him for that?

---
What was Bring Me to Life so damn good?
---
Losing your name has no real impact on gameplay and i'm sure blizzard could find a way to solve this if they know what 2 realms they will be merging they can somehow share the same data so there is no issues. With layering there are a lot more problems that effect peoples gameplay experiences, so far i've only heard people rationalize layering by saying it's better than sharding but are aware there are issues with the way it works.
---
It wont, raid bosses are immune to Frostbite.
---
It only fucks up AoE grind
---
I played on shattered hand (pvp) on alliance because my friends started before I did and picked the server. They played various pvp mmo's before one being shadowbane. Wasnt so bad honestly, every now and again you'd have some pvp battles but they were in select areas.
---
I also hope for a sever list to be released well in advanced so I can select a good sever to avoid them.
---
Assuming you knew what you were looking for, and you didn't say "A margin of error of 2% is fine...", which is what literally *everyone* does when they're doing polls or something.
---
You don't understand how layering works at all (and you're a brainlet) if you think that there is a 100% chance that they will drop layering in phase 2.
---
The reason why layering (and sharding) exist in the first place is because of the amount of people in an area, they are expecting the population to drop, simple as that, in fact, they are banking on it. You are just taking the word of them as the absolute truth, when if that was the case then layering wouldn't be present in the "initial weeks" to begin with.
---
What happens if it has an OSRS effect and it increases in popularity instead? they CAN'T drop layering, simple as that, so what then? No, the actual question you should be asking is why they are saying a thing for certain that implies that they expect it to drop population instead of increase over time, after all phase 2 is basically an expansion and games (for example PoE) have an increase in playerbase during an expansion, the negativity in their internal predictions keep showing that they're out of touch.
---
I don't accept your premise. I think the new character models are much better and wish they were in Classic.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP0-J1k1Ir8
---
Ehh maybe I'm a little naive given the disaster that was BFA beta but the classic team has been pretty responsive so far
---
Gotta get everything spic and span for launch!
---
Usually thorium prices will drop with server age. Lots of people will still farm thorium, but only for arcane crystals. Which leads to a steady stream of affordable thorium on the AH.
---
Mining is not worth it for just the engineering upkeep. Your AoE farm capability should give enough income.
---
Herbs is hard to say without knowing layering or (re-)spawn behaviour in general. But they tend to be more valuable. Definitly worth picking on a twink. Now if it is worth to make a twink just for herbalism? that is a different story altogether,
---
Nah bro it's good, I can't click play so I don't got it, R.I.P
---
R.I.P
---
No, pet behavior is just all kinds of fucked up. 
---
The pet states (Aggressive, Defensive, Passive) are not accurately doing what the tooltips say.
---
The Pet Attack command (Shift + T by default) and other pet commands like Stay and Follow take between .3 and .5 seconds to actually be registered and carried out by the pet, at which point the pet may or may not continue to do what you command.
---
The pet will not attack a second mob when commanded to on occasion if they were already fighting a first mob. 
---
Swapping pet states in combat (changing from Passive to Defensive) does not change their behavior.
---
The list goes on, they borked right now.
---
Thank you for checking, because I definitely remember finishing in November of that year and being super happy I completed it (and I wouldn't have had the same feeling if it was as easy as  "turn off xp.  explore."
---
I noticed when I tried to recreate my old vanilla toons I couldn't get it looking exactly how it used to. Back in Vanilla I made a human lock and made him look as evil as possible with this super sinister scowl. Classic had a few similar scowls but nothing that looked 100% the same. So I at least get the feeling it might be slightly different then just a resolution up.
---
I can't believe I didn't try cannabis until I was in my mid 20s.
---
I really could have used it back in the day when. I was farming on Vanilla.
---
I personally wish macros weren't in the game. I feel like it cheapens a lot of the gameplay, especially in PvP.
---
&gt; Nobody here is claiming that they said it was going to be final and that’s what was going in at launch
---
You are legit delusional. If you seriously think all the incels of this subreddit aren't here spamming about how Blizzard is backpedaling from just sharding to now full continent layering, you are mentally challenged. I hope you get the mental help you need. I'm sorry to be arguing with someone as inept as you.
---
They're not going to fix layering cause layering was already their "fix" and the devoted a fair amount of dev time to making it from the sounds of it.
---
They are probably going to ignore the issue rather than spend more dev time on a different fix that players will like more.
---
Though, the main change they need to make that would be easy and fix the issues for the most part, is to come out with a hard date on how long layering can exist, and the limit needs to be way shorter than what they currently are thinking, like a few weeks max, instead of possibly till phase 2.
---
I would rather have this than dead servers in the future
---
Brainlet detected, do you understand the core concept of layering? Clearly not, because this will be present no matter what, and at what stage "layering" is at.
---
Morons like you are the reason Blizzard gets away with shit like this.
---
That's why I mentioned the ''high class snob'' sound and ''inherent accent''. Every single popular language has multiple accents. It was kinda obvious.
---
Nothing in blacksmith is better than engineery. Dont get yourself trolled
---
This looks awesome.
---
If you're not doing complicated, hardcore stuff, you should look into making some cast sequences for specific jobs (farming, DPS rotations on tank&amp;spank bosses, heal rotations). They're not as versatile, but they drastically reduce necessary dexterity.
---
It looks awesome. You are very skilled at what you do. I tried working with polymer clay and I was fucking awful. I gave up on Day 2. Critiques: A bit asymmetrical. Also, I stalked your profile and I actually like it better before the paint, for some reason. I find that I frequently prefer things uncolored in digital art as well.
---
See guys, streaming has no impact on the game...
---
How accurate is this tool?  If you limit it to players from 30-40 it shows massive alliance advantage, but most indications I've seen from beta show a higher horde population.
---
That is how subjectivity works =p
---
If thats your stance why do you care? Obviously you do..
---
Who cares
---
That would imply there is no competition for tags anymore which means dynamic respawns will be dialed down so standing in one spot and killing mobs won't work. It's called "dynamic" respawns for a reason.
---
I'm drunk, so bear with me...
---
This is not about Classic, but you mentioning typing "RUN!!!" made me remember something from BC.
---
I was questing in Shadowmoon with a disc priest of mine, as a not very well-geared arms warrior. He and I met while raiding MC, and we stuck together up until we quit playing. So, while doing (I think?) the quets that has you feed nether drakes, we accidentally pulled that elite patrolling the area, I think it was Ruul the Drakener. Normally, you needed a full 5 man group for him, so I (quite heroically) equipped my sword + board, popped shield wall and yelled at my buddy to run, intending to stay where i was until I died to buy him as much time as possible. Yet...he refused. He stayed with me, doing whatever he could to keep me alive while damaging the mob as much as possible. And contrary to my expectations, we actually managed to both survive the fight and kill that sneaky-ass bitch of an elite.
---
So yeah, that's my very much off-topic story, as I said, I'm drunk as shit right now, and wanted to share this resurfaced memory.
---
I can not wait...
---
Yah, I am sure he is throwing away a thousand dollars a day to play fucking wow.
---
I got all of that stuff on Alliance, so it’s really just up to the individuals you happen to be playing with. 
---
Alliance or Horde, some people are nice, some people are pricks!
---
30 seconds to Mars is missing
---
Everyone saying that because that was all they literally told us. They never said anything else. They only ever said something about sharding the starting areas. They didn’t come out and say anything about layering till a month ago.  So up until that people everyone thought it was just the starting areas.
---
Omg all those rants about playing classic wow on stream only to not stream it LMFAOOOO
---
WoW plebs rn:
---
&gt; at - whatever the fuck that means anymore.
---
Okay, I hit the upboat, but I just wanted you to know that you made me laugh.
---
There's going to be a lot more people pugging raids this time around.
---
Even if you can't commit to your guilds raid every week there will still be chances to raid and catch up with loot.
---
I plan on playing a Tank just so that if I want to run an MC or Ony that week because I missed it, I can at least lead a group to some kills.
---
Doing a damn fine job son.
---
My post is sarcasm.
---
My point was that it would be easier for them to do nothing and just add servers but it's not a good solution and that's why  they're trying to use layering to solve the problems. You're saying layering saves them money when it definitely doesn't. Much cheaper not to bother with developing the tech and just using more servers then merging. But those aren't real solutions. Those aren't satisfactory solutions.
---
The game is 2 months away, there's still plenty of tech testing to be done but to say they're doing this because it's cheaper is stupid.
---
I hope the snipers organize themselves well and snipe him offstream aswell, it would be hilarious.
---
They actually said that layering is to not merge servers later on. It is not because of launch. So your drawn out explanation has a false premise
---
Have you #nochanges ever considered that payed realm transfer with limits (like only character gear and some specific bank stored quest items/soulbound offgear transfered without any in-game currency to abuse difference in market prices between servers) could solve the whole problem of fluctuation?
---
It has a decent impact on PvP. In PvE white hits are the majority of your damage though.

Yeah, thats pretty stupid. You're essentially paying hundreds/thousands a day to play WoW off stream. To do that for months is just such a weird decision to make.

I mean he did it with private servers, but i guess its different when you can actually stream the game without getting banned.

They've said something to the effect that having too many players in a zone with spells and abilities going off causes other performance problems.
---
This is my plan also. I have a few buddies sending me their cloth so I can help everyone out. We are gonna be a charity guild since when we started playing we got a ton of help and it made the game more enjoyable.
---
Yeah there would legit murder over games like this
---
This is similar to how it was in vanilla.  Instead of them all popping at once as your max view distance moved you would start to see them gradually and maybe 1 or 2 would even pop in late.
---
Always leaving in the middle of raids because it's siesta time.  Lazy jerks!

Yeah, cause self-made multi-millionaires never take large vacations from work whenever they want. /s

Where are you in 90% of the decisions I want to make in life. &lt;/3
---
No but for real, I wish I found your post before I got deep into macro'ing and found about the loss of information. Now I'm battling muscle memory against optimally having all information in front of me.
---
You're taking what was said out of contact.  
---
They said they would phase layering out over the first couple of weeks until they were down to a single world instance, then cited kazzak and azuregos as a reason for it being important to do that.  That is very different from saying that it will last for all of phase 1.   
---
[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYuUD0o-Nz8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=236) is the link to the interview if you want to learn more.
---
As someone in game development try and look at this from a developer perspective.
---
What if there isn't another solution, and if there is it might require the game to be postponed. Are you okay with that? If not others will not be. A date is set and they MUST meet that date.
---
I hope for a fix but would I rather play a game with 500+ people making it impossible to level and a terrible experience for everyone or layering for a few weeks. It's not the true classic experience but it seems they're doing everything they can to make it be. If they can't we shrug our shoulders and enjoy classic for everything else that it is.
---
Pussy
---
It's been a while since I last played WoW; what do the red/grey circles around the monster portrait indicate?  Is that the default look or an add-on?
---
That last comment in chat :(
---
I made a post about how bad of an idea layering was and got crucified. Now suddenly everyone gets that this is NOT VANILLA. Funny how things go full circle.
---
remember on the main reddit when people were saying "DONT WORRY BFA IS ONLY IN BETA THEY WILL FIX THIS" and then nothing got fixed.
---
&gt; I mean layering/phasing has already jumped from "just for launch" to "until phase 2 at the latest".
---
Source? As far as I've seen from actual official statements, it's still just for launch.
---
This guy gets it.
---
this is the best answer.
---
Bring a broom because it's a mess!
---
Well said, I'm not a follower of streamers myself but I can definitely see how Sodapoppin is doing us all a service by exposing these kinds of exploitable features.  
---
I really hope Blizzard do something about it too.  I really want to play Classic, but not if it's going to have this kind of thing.  
---
I took part in the last two stress tests and the layering was really noticeable in capital cities.  I understand how it alleviates some of the congestion in 1-5 areas but beyond that it really isn't necessary.  When I did a /who Orgrimmar I could see 50 people in my level range on the social tab, none of them were in my empty Org layer.  It wasn't until the final 10 minutes of the stress test today did I see how many people were on the other layers (as they squashed them altogether).
---
I always called it DM and if there was any confusion I just shift clicked their name and their level would tell me if it was Deadmines or Dire Maul.
---
I assumed Alliance scum called it VC and the few Horde that ventured over that way called it DM.
---
But we can all agree that it's DM right?
---
Shamans bring so Much utility to a raid, totems and to be honest i preferred shamans over priests when i played on pserver and we usually had about 6-7 shamans every raid. You will in no way have troubles with raid spot/groups
---
You could always just search here for 'leeway', and see things like [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bu06u3/melee_leeway_is_working_correctly/).
---
People wanting to be "unique" via their class pick is kind of funny. If you really have an issue with playing Mages because there are many of them, learn the class in and out - be the top 5-10-20% of Mages in terms of skill and you won't have an issue. 
---
Being part of the 'dime a dozen crowd' is only an issue if your gameplay is super mediocre and you aren't interested in being good at your class. In that case a Mage might not be the best pick, you'd be better off going a class that is brought for utility alone.
---
Generally this is a bit of a tic with layering. When you see this happen generally it resolves itself when you travel into the next sub zone. It is a bit annoying but easy to work around.
---
Oh wow I was wondering what was happening when I couldn’t find the battle masters and I knew I was in the room, then they appeared out of nowhere when I turned around and back again. Thought I was seeing things. Or not seeing things.
---
How do you know how many people actually cancelled their subs?  Blizzard doesn't publish that information and daily logins trackers wouldn't be able to figure out if someone cancelled their sub, so, where are those numbers coming from?
---
Uh.. if you think tagging mobs is going to be exactly as hard with layering on as it is off then I'm afraid you're sadly mistaken. The difference between players spread out throughout layers and all players in the same area is huge. I'm not sure how you came to your conclusion that they'd be the same.
---
&gt;I’m not complaining about tagging mobs. Tagging mobs is going to be incredibly annoying unless they add sharding. I’m talking about layering. Keep up bud
---
You can't talk about layering or complain about layering at release or even in the first few weeks without acknowledging the difficulty of tagging mobs, as it relates to even playing the game and progressing your character forward. You basically just admitted you don't even know what the fuck you're talking about, nice one.
---
&gt; when there is sufficient evidence in the bug report to validate the reporter's claim.
---
When two reddit threads hits the frontpage*. The topic went five days without a response, but it got a reply within hours once these threads went up on reddit.
---
I mean, glad they're paying attention somewhere at least, but really makes you wonder what else is reported on the forums that may be overlooked because no reddit thread was made.
---
you are both using the same source for different claims lol
---
It has a lot of potential for murder....

Oh hey I can see the mailbox I used to stand on.

So real money transactions are better than temporary systems? Wut?
---
There was a point when they were merging layers at the end of the test where there was a hefty amount of people in Stormwind but it wasn't laggy, and I was like "Oh my gosh why is layering even a thing?!" And then they fully merged all layers and a tidal wave of people came rushing into Trade District and the lag started.
---
THEN I KNEW
---
You cant play games with satellite internet the ping will be in the thousands.
---
We know they've said it will be several weeks, but as has been beaten like a drum by many on this subreddit, the difference between 2 weeks and 4 weeks is huge.
---
What do you mean radio silence on layering? We just had a 48 hour test designed to test layering so they can fine tune it lol
---
If you really had been here since day 1 there's no way you'd be fighting for the shit show that was launch week.
---
Everyone is taking classic wow way too seriously. There's 40 people in a raid that you could finish with 25-30 people. 10 of those people can literally beat their meat while the rest of the group does the raid and it'll still be fine.
---
I know its stupid to put down a mage that isn't AoE grinding, but when i'm AoE farming anywhere at 60 and I see a Mage single-target pulling mobs for the same farm - I really want to know the thought process. Why kill one when you CAN kill 15? 
---
Im not talking about competition issues though.

The retail models are significantly higher quality. The base models have much more detail and they’re not blocky and jagged. Classic has the exact same models as it always did, just a higher resolution and the colors are updated because of course they are.
---
I'd play a toon, but have a secret toon.

Thanks so much

I wonder what else is wrong.

Your party member is a rogue, so disappearing is normal.  Also he's very short, so you probably just didn't notice him.

I don't think my issue will be with getting ahead, my biggest problem is not wanting to be ahead because I don't want to feel obligated to not sleep. 
---
I will be leveling a Mage on release, but I am not looking to get ahead of the pack for this reason. I'd be just as happy grouping up with people as much as possible!

Bounce layers and hope noone is farming there whenever you get ganked, if there is someone in your spot keep bouncing layers.

Definitely not broken.

---
Can someone please explain what layering is :p
---
Who's going to do this? You need another player on a different layer to invite you to a party, are these supposed herbalists/miners going to just spam general asking for a group on a new layer all day long?
---
This is pretty much fine and harmless, it's not addressing the real issue. We're simply asking for there to be specific realms for people who want to stay only within their language community, instead of fracturing a realm's community into sub-groups, or risking rolling your characters into a realm that is later claimed as an unofficial language server.
---
What about in the video where I'm standing completely still and Zenn Foulhoof is just missing from the game world, and then appears a little while later? What subzones are there?
---
Further, the videos above are only two samples from the issues I observed during my play session (only 5 hours). Consider that your experience (and mind) are much more likely to be an "average" experience in the distribution of all player experiences. It's very likely someone out there is having a much worst experience, and the worst, say, 5% of experiences are very likely to be quite bad, based on what I've seen.

You are right, I too like him more when it's not painted. I need to improve my painting a lot, but I also need smaller brushes and better acrylic paint (this one is cheaper and there are a lot of fragments and bubbles).

They just look wrong to me. Then again I stopped playing at the start of Cata, so I never really used the new models. They're higher fidelity, but they just don't have any charm to them. I especially dislike the new Orc and Tauren models.
---
Just downvote and move on folks
---
No you don’t. You just need a different character on a different layer. Mine node, log out, log into that toon to grab layer, log back in to be in that layer.

You actually can see the cooldowns if you include "`#show`" and "`#showtooltip`". I appreciate Sea's caution, but if you're running into situations where your macros restrict your choices, then that's an opportunity to improve them. Add modifiers or additional conditions, or just have more skills on your bar. The goal should be to have the perfect response to any situation.
---
"it's just beta they are gonna fix it" tired of hearing this, after it comes out you would just say it just released

I mean, troll is probably the best horde tank race. Orc takes the cake for Warrior DPS though.

Same here, I'm not after world first or the AQ battle tank. Just going to enjoy playing and making new friends.
---
You want to get broken tooth fast?  Skip through layers.
---
I don't care about layering. I care about people like you that can't let go of it and spend every day filling this sub with your layering conspiracy ideas of how it will ruin classic forever. This sub suffers because you all can't just accept that layering will exist. Everyone wants exploits to be fixed. Not everyone thinks it will cause armageddon. Please, either get on board or let the rest of us enjoy it.
---
Streamers are going to ruin classic.
---
You know what I did for crazy launch weeks? I waited until the shitshow was over and played then. The fact that people are willing to implement layering purely for a smooth launch is fucking ridiculous to me:
---
Layering Pros / Cons:
---
Pro: Smooth Launch
---
Con: Ruins world PvP
---
Con: Messes with rare materials
---
Con: Exploitation of rare spawns
---
Seems like a good trade to me buddy.
---
It's because they don't care.
---
Again, that shows a fundamental misunderstanding of how layering works. I'm not going to continue a conversation with someone who refuses to actually try to learn about the subject first.
---
It won’t impact the community so much down the road. We’re still 2 months out, a majority of the players are off living regular lives and classic wow won’t be on their radar until launch.
---
it would be, anything that can be abused will be abused unless you are dumb, i dont like this but if its in the game then i would abuse it
---
Smokey's Lighter, Ramstein's Lightning Bolts, Linken's Boomerang, Helm of Fire, Electomagnetic Gigaflux Reactivator, Shard of the Fallen Star. Probably more.
---
This is fine and it's the norm of any regular EU realm.
---
The real issue is that there will be people who want to play in their language community, which is why language realms are a thing in EU retail. If there's no official realms, some Polish guys risks rolling his alt in a realm that, a month later, became the unofficial Spanish language realm, and he can't communicate with anyone.

They like stare off in to space sometimes. They're ar less responsive than they used to be.
---
People who go on and on about this idea of people hopping layers to nab nodes/spawns seem to forget that you need someone else to get you onto the layer. Where are all these layer-hopper bitches at? Who's gonna just sit around inviting people to their layer so those people can come and take all the nodes/elites?
---
The french is pretty bad too.
---
It's interesting you are whining about such try hard nonsense while saying that your solution is to just not play for a week.
---
I do not use add-ons, so I do not really know.
---
To me there this awkwardness. Where all the faces look kind of constipated, and none of the hair fits with rest of the face. Classic models may lack both polys and refinement they just feel normal. Nothing completely blows me away but I don't get that awkwardness either.
---
Your team mate could help round up more mobs than one mage could safely do on his own. Plus it could enable areas where mobs are to spaced out to be pulled together by just one char. Especially interesting if the usual spots are already occupied early in classic.
---
Or a Druid with hurricane and innervate on the mage might enable you to clear packs you otherwise could not, for example.
---
Or rounding up mobs in instances might become viable, etc. 
---
Do I believe that 2 people will reach double the exp/h of a mage farming solo? No. But I do think that it can be a viable alternative.
---
There were way more alliance users initially, the horde info is still coming in!
---
Seeing the layers collapse and going from 6 people on the Org bank to 100+ was weird

---
I got DCed three hours into the stress test because my sub ran out. I almost decided to sub again but I prefer to save it for the real deal.
---
I’m designing lesson plans for just about exactly this. 
---
My first lessons involve replaying 1-5 questing 3 different times to let her make characters and see the different areas, how you can walk to an alternative start area- during this the goal is for the learner gain some of the initial curiosity needed to get interested in one of the role categories (frontline, backline, cc, support, heal) and comprehend the wide angle of exploration with multiple types of objectives.
---
"it won't be the end of the world." you think so, trust me this is not retail this is vanilla and its gonna be abused everywhere and it will be fucking annoying
---
I wasn’t whining. I was just stating how easy it is. Im a rogue so i have plenty of stuns. Plus i type super fast. Also discord. All i gotta do is ask. Just because you’re slow doesn’t mean I am.
---
10 then reduced to 2 then raised to 4 for the test.
---
That sounds accurate to my warlock experience In Vanilla Lol
---
&gt;This man is clearly delusional. 
---
Take him to the infirmary!
---
Realm 15 was so fucking fun. I played horde.
---
Taking a week off the game isn't going to mean layering is gone when i'm back. Are you daft? IF LAYERING WAS NOT IN THE GAME - TAKING A WEEK OR TWO OFF ON RELEASE MEANS YOU WILL COME BACK TO A RELATIVELY NORMAL AREA
---
Actually, I had a couple ideas regarding focus. These are less versatile and clunkier than the @mouseover command, but could be extremely useful when pocket healing or doing PvE content.
---
You can use the "/targetlasttarget" to essentially save your last target as a focus. If you use a macro like:
---
    /targetlasttarget
---
    /cast Heal
---
You will switch to your saved target (in this case, say, the tank in your PUG) and cast Heal on it, then immediately switch back to your current target. 
---
You can begin the macro with other target commands, like /targetfriendplayer or /targetenemyplayer, to snap to a nearby enemy or ally and quickly use a skill without losing your current target. Of course, these macros can be confused by multiple targets. 
---
These target commands can take all the normal conditional modifiers too. You can also /target a specific player, or specific party/raid spot.
---
I like your shit sandwich style. I think its Thrall's chest that looks off? Maybe its the proportions between the head and the chest?
---
If I look at any individual part of the figurine, it looks fucking awesome. The face is super detailed, the leather looks good, the hands don't look like weird mittens or banana hands. The hair braiding looks detailed as fuck.
---
But when I look at it as a whole, it looks off. Like you said though, its great, its infinitely better than anything I've seen or could do.
---
to add further to this: open up a second game client and type in your acc info. then just log onto your twink via the second instance of the game to skip the 20s logout timer should you be away from an inn
---
They just did a stress test with layering initially disabled, then enabled, I'm pretty sure they're working on it. People need to chill a little, it is a **beta** with over a month left.
---
I wouldn't call an open stress test meant to test various forms of Layering "radio silence". They're clearly working on it.
---
Have they said anything about the unkillable priest bug? You don't hear anyone complaining about that.
---
Everyone from the US? You’re offending us all. Maybe I would have been on your side. Apparently im too retarded though.
---
But it isn't.  This is how sharding works.
---
The pets are secretly just units from Starcraft Remastered.

Ya, a bunch of people so obsessed with sodapoppin that they put the rest of their gameplay on hold to track him down and gank him repeatedly is hilarious.
---
My first post and I added a SS but it didn't get added to the post.
---
Not like the US realms don’t have people who don’t speak English. Sure not as common as EU still happens.
---
Almost as if there are people who speak different languages and you are connecting to a virtual world where anyone can log in. Weird?!
---
right.  it is important to note that apparently the correct classic values were factually known, so they could be used to prove the current values  incorrect.
---
One wonders if a post without hard evidence would even have been investigated.  
---
One also wonders how this fits the forum mantra of 'they have the 1.12 server running for comparison.'
---
Many database items in wow were never actually published.  there is almost no way to dispute mob dps, for example, with any sort of depth of vanilla data.
---
Ah, so you're just a moron.  Please read what I've said before you reply to me again.
---
on our server it was DM for deadmines and DM:N/E/W/T/complete/nowIamJustMakingStuffUP for dire maul. no confusion either.
---
Last I heard, Soda was having financial troubles so I'm not sure he does have millions in his bank account.
---
Even still, the kind of person who thinks the way you're describing is usually not the kind of person who gets to the point of having millions of dollars.
---
Only after you Alliance filth
---
The demand will run out eventually too for certain items. It would suck to watch one person cash in and i cant.
---
Using words like "triggered" and "conspiracy" to deny legitimate problems.. is it wrong to be passionate about a game I've personally been asking for for years?  I made a post around Cata asking for Legacy servers.
---

Because they are probably still discussing it internally and don't have an answer yet.

Where did you hear that?

Chest is inclined forward, shoulders should be set back chest out as a show of confidence. He's Thrall, the Warchief. Not the editor of "soy drinkers monthly".

The style and details and colours are pretty cool though!

Are there any that you can use from your inventory and are not trinkets?
---
&gt;it is a beta with over a month left.
---
Uh, that should concern the hell out of you. 
---
Unless you have zero knowledge of Blizzards history with not fixing major game breaking issues with Warcraft
---
the data that is needed to fully dispute current dungeon tuning doesn't exist in the public domain, as far as I know.  That is the big difference between this 'error' here (it  could be demonstrably proven to be wrong) and the elite damage issue.
---
/e farts on %T!
---
One guy got the arena master in one go because he hopped layers to get the chest in stv. It’s possible.
---
If something that most of us would think actually had hard numbers attached them was not correctly down ported... then sky is the limit. 
---
Who frickin knows what will be wrong if someone out there isn't capable of somehow proving it.
---
Layering abuse? There are bugs and people are testing them. Nothing to comment on so why would they
---
I’m a mage. Just need focus target casting and stopcast counterspells.
---
Well you were supposed to spam trade chat with "INVITE TO ASMON LAYER PLZ"
---
FYI: Pick Pocket is actually pick pocket, not pickpocket.  A guy made a thread the other day because it wouldn't work in a macro, and that was why.
---
Wrong!  Now you will be told, instead, that this is what betas are for!
---
How can you kill that which has no life?
---
&gt; There are bugs and people are testing them. Nothing to comment on so why would they
---
That makes no sense. Then why are they commenting on other countless bugs?
---
It doesn't change anything.. your point makes zero sense outside of "Hurr Durr hes a tryhard but he also can go without WoW for a while"
---
What do you mean radio silence on layering? We just had a 48 hour test designed to test different layering settings lol
---
Obviously they think its going to benefit to the health of the game in the long run. Why wouldn't they think that, it's their plan.
---
It could be part of the nerf to the braziers/fire pits at ironforge auction house; i remember they removed either the sound or the damage effect entirely. People used to annoy auction house goers by afking near the fires. 
---
it could be that this lava was part of that "nerf", it is in a high traffic area after all. 
---
so you could be remembering correctly.
---
And /chicken for the chicken pet
---
it was the end of the stresstest, they got rid of the layering and spawned Baron and some whelps on us.
---
They aren't.
---
Engineering items like grenades, dapper charges, bombs. There’s also the Un’Goro crystal charges (used these to kill eye beams during C’thun).
---
&gt;Obviously they think its going to benefit to the health of the game in the long run. Why wouldn't they think that, it's their plan.
---
So basically "just trust blizzard".
---
can i get some franch frys
---
Yea, they clearly don't have the proper numbers for everything based on how many things they have fixed post report, and pretty much ever report like that has been extremely in depth and cannot be ignored by them.
---
An example of something that Blizzard refuses to comment on would be the player skeleton persistence and despawn timer.  Most of us know that skeletons lasted long enough for a single gold farmer to spell out an entire website's name in ironforge and persist for quite a while, and it was done with 1 body to boot. 
---
Yet currently skeletons seem to be despawning in under 20 minutes and only one skeleton per player is allowed to be up at any given time.  
---
My guess is that they will not change this unless someone forces their hand.
---
If you havent noticed: the demons work for US.
---
Layering = sharding.  This is it working as intended
---
No, people should be passionate. However, claiming doomsday non stop over a temporary problem and saying classic is ruined is not being passionate, it's being childish. And the longer these threads pop up, the more people grow tired of it and decide not to enjoy the game. That's why I don't like these, because it sours the community against a really good game and then insult everyone who disagrees as retail fan boys. Most people here probably quit retail a long time ago and those who still play are likely looking for something different to spice up retail as they go back and forth
---
No, it really shouldn't. It's just a game and I'll be playing it whether Layering is in or not, exploitable or not. It's not going to be in the game for very long anyway. There are bigger fish to fry in life.
---
That's classic WoW though, ganking is 90% of the game
---
I mean Eve online is a great example of how sub-communities forming is more of a feature than a problem.
---
and nuclear mushroom clouds with equipment.
---
Because Asmon, Esfand, and Tips haven’t spoken up against it yet
---
No, it's not. They've very clearly said that layering is meant to be more constant than sharding.
---
I'm coming to appreciate this as the subreddit bubble.
---
1. Subreddit starts off with dedicated fandom sharing enthusiasm
---
2. Subreddit grows
---
3. Upvoted Posts increasing are geared towards conflict
---
I see the rants and complaints less about the community losing faith in blizzard and more so the topics that tend to thrive in large groups. Source:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE3j\_RHkqJc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE3j_RHkqJc) 
---
I think the blizzard team is made up of some people looking for a paycheck to live on and some people looking to give a great experience. They won't give us something intentionally crappy but they have their own marching orders to listen to and a chain of command to follow. I'm trying to keep realistic expectations.
---
If Blizzard "[never] fixes major game breaking issues" then it wouldn't matter how much or little time they have left. But of course that is just hyperbole, and there being over a month left is plenty of time to figure out how extensive/how long they wish to have layering enabled to find a good balance.
---
Eh, I doubt they will be testing things all the way to release.  I think it is more accurate to assume we are at about the half way point and have 1.5 months or so of actual testing and fixing.  
---
So in a sense, yea there is time, but many things have been reported since day 1 of beta and have still gone without a word from Blizzard because no one has hard evidence.  Player skeleton despawn timers and count per player.
---
I agree with what you said, and from a technical standpoint I see the logic of layering. Day 1 or even week 1 would be a madhouse without something done.
---
But they should try to fix two problems. Hopping layers on demand, and layers extending out into level 20+ zones and higher. If they did something about these two things, it would be perfect.
---
on really crappy computers like mine was
---
Sure it would suck but it would be temporary and not negatively affect the economy or world pvp
---
They don't say anything because nothing they say will change anybody's mind, and it will get memed.  I don't really like layering either, but that's how it's gonna be.  Layering is definitely for sure going to be happening.  My plan is to abuse it to the fullest like everyone else is going to do.
---
Shaman is a hero, but priests will do more healing focus. Choose accordingly! I am recommending to shaman to any of my newcomers I’m teaching who don’t want to be a mage for that dank cc and dps backline
---
I really don't understand why people are so spiteful towards streamers on this subreddit.
---
I do think something is off with the pet delay crap, but pets were a bit wonky back then in stupid ways... tough to truly remember which expansion fixed what problem, but even wrath still had some problems.
---
I plan on healing with Clique.  It's more efficient than mouseover macros.
---
Scuffed but cute
---
So? if they don't want to play WoW Classic THE SAME WAY it was 15 years ago, then they obviously don't want to play WoW Classic in the first place. I don't think we need to cater to that fanbase. If they like it great, if they don't? who gives a fuck.
---
Claiming 'Doomsday' no i'm just making the correct assumption that this is far from Vanilla WoW. Its not the same game if it comes out this way. That's my point! I want to play Vanilla WoW - not some half-baked turd.
---
Holy fuck the number of neck beard babies in this sub is astounding
---
&gt;It's not going to be in the game for very long anyway. 
---
I truly wish I was deluded enough to take their word as truth.
---
Even 1 extra points for paladins to get Divine Favor and Repentance at the same time would be huge. Reckoning and Holy Shock is just icing on the cake for that.
---
What other option do they have if population stays high after P1?
---
Those are rogue combo points lol
---
t. retailbaby
---
I mean he has done it before with private servers. He can afford to do it.
---
Not sure how you got "trust Blizzard" out of that, but ok.
---
Just talk in Gnomish and you'll be fine.
---
Was it done on a fresh server without any gold / twinking? Genuine question
---
Ironforge is your go to city but stormwind is also decent. Darn is bad and a dead city 90% of the time
---
Looking forward to slaying you traitor scum. For THRALL! FOR THE HORDE!
---
So if you don't trust their word, why the fuck do you care if there's "radio silence" on the subject at all?
---
I'm pretty sure you don't.  It does matter what zone you're in.  If population &gt; some number, layering happens.
---
Yes, but the other things were built into the game and are expected gameplay mechanics to begin with.  
---
This is suppose to be an authentic experience right?  I don't get when people bring this logic up.
---
Just a note - this farm is hard AF to learn. Literally 4 of the 5 mages I knew gave up on it.
---
I'm not gonna lie, I watched that for way too long thinking it was a clip. Ya got me.
---
I’m for the horde 100% .. but I’d say Stormwind would be where I’d hangout. That’s where all the world buffs will drop, so I’d chill there.
---
what does prepare you for a fight, bobby b?
---
LH Private server has people from all over the world it works just fine.
---
SURROUNDED BY LANNISTERS! EVERY TIME I CLOSE MY EYES I SEE THEIR BLONDE HAIR AND THEIR SMUG, SATISFIED FACES!
---
They literally just made a post about how their instant attack normalization is wrong and they're testing fixes for it.
---
Another possibility, some quest NPCs have scripted events where they will disappear for a few and then respawn. Dunno if that is one of them, but worth looking into.
---
and low ranks extremly potent to cheese out a cheaper blizzard. I think it is unlikely to proc on a per-tick basis. But we will see.
---
i am a huuuuge fan of modifiers and conditions in my macros. everything gets put into a macro of some sort.  while i do not have a beta client, i do have my holy priest macros written ready to go

 **Rallying Cry of the Dragonslayer**Increases critical chance of spells by 10%, melee and ranged by 5% and grants 140 attack power. 120 minute duration.  
---
2 hours remaining    
---
**School** Physical  
---
**Mechanic** n/a  
---
**Dispel type** n/a   
---
Yeah good luck with that lol
---
I also thoroughly enjoyed the stress test despite the truly extreme overcrowded start areas. Looking forward to August
---
Ironforge is the efficient city. The bank and AH are right next to each other. A lot of people hang out in SW too though. Which is nice, on Horde everyone is in Org and the other cities are ghost towns.
---
This argument goes by the assumption that Classic will ultimately die. I think that's a bad mindset. Who's saying that the population won't rise instead of decline? That's exactly what happened to OSRS, albeit after new content started arriving.
---
Even if there was a decline in players I bet Blizzard could merge "dying" servers together.
---
I'm not a fan, just seen a few hours of his content since classic was announced and I started checking some streams. That said, he's a little edgy and spicy but imo pretty funny and entertaining. The stuff he's done with raids of followers has also been fun and even interesting to watch or listen to. Frankly, even if he's serious about doing all those things I don't see the issue. Ninjas and raids on cities/towns were a feature of vanilla. If you're on horde just quest in a different town or defend; if you're alliance don't group with him if you don't trust him, his character names will be well known I'm sure.
---
What do I think? I think Thrall should get off that chocolate donut so you can eat it.
---
I doubt anyone will read this outside of me because of the notification and the 2 people that might use the search bar looking for this.
---
Your premises are also outdated. It has been confirmed that we are getting 1.12 itemization. The question now is whether we get fully progressive loot tables or not.
---
You're also listing items that we know won't be in the game til later phases (Amalgam's Band drops from a t0.5 quest boss, Sash of the Grand Hunt drops post-1.10 loot tables changes).
---
This is a nice effort post but in a place where practically nobody will see it as well as it being slightly misinformed.
---
It will be abused by a small minority.
---
It is as authentic as it gets.  Rather than giving you a hundred servers at launch, and 80% of them winding up dead so they have to do server merges, they're giving you layers to avoid that.
---
You can't always fix every problem in the exact way you want.  People riding griffons have always popped in and out of existence.  Loads of things do that in the game.  I can't be bothered to the point of raging about it on reddit by it.  I just can't.
---
I'm not to not play because someone faded out.  My character will explain it away by magic.  It's not a big deal.
---
Zod?
---
For most of Vanilla, Ironforge was the major city because it was the only one with an Auction House (until the AQ patch).
---
But in Classic, Stormwind will have an Auction House at launch, so it will become the main Alliance hub. Namely because it's closer to all the raids until Naxx.
---
I'm sure making game changing materials and consumables more plentiful won't have any negative impact on the game..../s
---
Stop spending this ridiculous, cancerous toxicity.
---
Thanks for responding man -- I appreciate the rational response.  If it's actually just the first couple weeks I'll be fine with it.  The current implementation is not how it was initially described, however, and is totally gamebreaking.  The big issue I have is that there is not a clear window for when they will disable it and, to be honest, I don't think it's really a matter of opinion whether Blizzard can be trusted to adequately manage their own intellectual property -- they've 100% fucked it over the last 6-7 years, which is why I'm so on edge about the sharding issue.  That's my top reason for why retail is shit.  
---
When I played on Nostalrius I was playing casually and made tons of friends (and enemies) over the course of a couple months, all before level 50, so those early levels are SUPER IMPORTANT to me.  I also played vanilla (from Beta to the middle of TBC hardcore).  They need to get this right.  
---
But yeah, if it's literally 2 weeks I'll be cool with it.  I see no statement for that information, however.
---
i completely fucking agree that layering is a disaster im just white knighting for streamers cause im tired of seeing bullshit hate for anything against them. they are this subs bogeyman
---
Cause it's beta mate, its what we're all testing for. We can't forget that this is them emulating a vanilla client using a later client, right? There's bound to be bugs and I think we all give Blizz a little too much shit seeing as they have been fixing these problems as they come up.
---
Ironforge won't be nearly as popular in Classic as it was in Vanilla.
---
exactly.  Much of what is being disputed (aggro ranges, elite mob damage, fall damage?, skeleton timers, etc) is not going to have the kind of cut-and-dry proof that this case had, ever.  The thing is blizz mgmt may be happy with the game more or less as-in but something proven this blatantly they have to visibly respond to.  everything else they can ignore or vaguely say working as intended.

Your post points out that people don't want to go through the difficulties that existed in vanilla wow. Specifically the difficulty of forming groups to clear content. Vanilla wow, clearing raids and getting tier loot was an amazing achievement, not a given. Having tier gear was fairly exclusive to the top guilds on the server, but people didn't play wow just to simply get bis gear.
---
They call me Obtuse, and Warrior is my calling.
---
I want the original game. I personally don't mind queues or crowded starter zones at all, I don't need to speedrun quests two minutes after launch.
---
I understand the economic reasons of what they're doing, but for me it changes the game too much in a negative way so that I'm not interested in playing it like that.
---
Nah he was on the other server.
---
Yeah, i ran it several times over, probably 5 or 6 and it just wouldn't drop.  I think that boss (the caster guy after the guy in the cave) used to not always drop loot, so it was a pain
---
What happens if you kill a faction leader?
---
🤷🏾‍♀️ So what? You’ve already signed your privacy over to Activision Blizzard in the term of service. So I see no reason not to add an extra cook in the kitchen. 
---
If you care about your individual privacy that can come from a company looking at your private message, you shouldn’t be here because reddit for one reserve the right to look at, edit and even share messages you post on its platform and blizzard requires you to give consent just for a battle net account.
---
What kind of things have you caught?
---
Layering is their fix, but they’re absolutely still tinkering with it. They basically said as much before this week’s stress test. Some of the feedback they requested specifically centered around how the early levels felt to players. 
---
And they also basically said phase 2 is the absolute latest layering would be in, and it most likely will be significantly less. I know that’s not a guarantee, but they are saying they want it as short as possible. 
---
With all of the grief the community is giving them about layering, do you really think they aren’t going to change a thing about it, and that they aren’t going to use it for as short as absolutely necessary?
---
If it just says "World of Warcraft Classic" in the version dropdown, that's not the beta.
---
One week of this shit is too long.
---
Jealousy mostly. These people are banking more money than anybody here will ever see in their lives sitting there playing WoW.
---
I love it. And if you meant showing Thrall in its childhood while he was still a little shy, its superb. Whatever..... I love it! Good work!
---
Most of us already have been.  At this time, it's a more authentic experience!
---
Blizzard is taking the easier and cheaper way out with this, bottom line.  I will continue to shame them for that decision, because, once again, it's not an authentic experience!
---
Fuck layering!
---
Big fucking deal.
---
Anyone who complains is a true moron because Asmon did this literally in the LAST TWO HOURS of the stress test. Only the last 40ish minutes was when insufferable lag happened. Good luck making even a half a level of xp progress in 40min in Classic.
---
arg of course, ty
---
They're testing layering, they're not testing incorrect number values. They are likely watching how people are abusing layers to figure out how to better implement it. They want and need people to break their game, especially when it comes to new tech like layering. Not to mention they're going to be using layering no matter what, its just up to the implementation. They're not going to be using Legion numbers no matter what, at least not intentionally.
---
It will be the while world for the first 9 months. Mark my words.
---
Your tired of hearing facts? Boy listen to yourself!  It's BETA! Your supposed to be testing!  Not crying over something that ain't going to be in the released game. So your research!  Blizzard said it won't be in the game.
---
For PVP servers yes. For all servers, yes agian, because videos show you can phase between layers to respawns mining / herb nodes. that means the low level economy will be **completely** broken. No challenege to levelling professions what so ever.
---
You can do a shot for shot rerelease of star wars today, but will it be the same as the 1977 debut? No, because we all know the story, inside and out. Same with classic. If your expectation is a 15 year time machine, you're going to be disappointed. For those of us looking for an mmorpg brought back to life for new things to experience in the same old world, we will enjoy classic, with or without layering. And as far as I know, aside from things like auto loot, layering and the way patches are working vs itemization, it's pretty much a replica of vanilla
---
I'm recording characters on alliance side since around 31th May, but made the project public only yesterday. Thatswhy there are way more characters recorded for ally side. But on the activity chart you can see, that the population is pretty much balanced with a little advance for horde:

---
Remind me on September 15th to come back and laugh at this kids post.
---
did you play the stress test? You are really being disingenuous about the scope of the issue. The stress test, that still had layering, still saw the entirety of Elwynn being almost unplayable. People were killing orange/red mobs just to be able to *kill something*. Layering lasting forever = bad. Layering lasting long enough to make launch playable without having to spin up more servers as people dine and dash the shit out of classic = good.
---
Remove layering?
---
This is just my opinion but... I agree with Blizzard that there will be a huge rush to play this game and it will die off VERY FAST at level 20.  
---
Even then... There were times in Vanilla and older expansions that they offered free transfers OFF servers because of population.
---
I think they know better to offer that than continue layering.
---
I'm obviously on the side of no layering.  I'm also on the side that hopes Blizzard is smart enough to recognize this and has a plan for it.
---
Can someone explain why layering is a bad thing? I havn't formed an opinion yet and I'm just hearing about it now. What are the reasons besides this^?
---
30/0/21 ele shaman is probably what you want to play. You give WF / good support you have good healing and NS. Your burst is out of this world.
---
I'm shine wanting to play Paladin in Classic.
---
I wish I hated myself as much as I love the Judgement set.
---
More people need to see posts like this. This is a HUGE bug, should not happen from what blizzard has stated.
---
Great job, I love what you did with the [source material](https://i.redd.it/avxb6sc01tm21.png).
---
Really, good job. Maybe it's just the camera angle that's throwing the posture off, everything else looks great.
---
It's going to last like 3 weeks man.
---
Mages are good for devilsaurs as well.  Be sure to keep mana pots just in case.  And do NOT get hit.

What is that desk?

As for 5, I always key (not macro) my arrow keys to skull, moon, triangle, X. Usually that is enough to handle dungeons, and I don't use arrow keys anyway. Just hit them with the left hand while targeting with the mouse.

I’m in a very similar situation. I’ve got a group of friends that wants to roll ally. I’ll likely have an alt I play with the group because I’m terrible but I’m a professional try hard on my main

Dwarven Hand Cannon can be had from the AH. I had one before MC rolled out back in 2005. Seems likely it will be in during Phase 1.

Start saving yer gold!
---
For Europe wouldn’t it make sense to just make the server language Arabic since you’ll all be speaking it in 20 years any way?
---
I mean, they're a business. If 95% of the population are okay with layering, why risk upsetting communities with mergers 2 months into the game (by which point layering would be gone). I mean, if shaming them is so important to you, why support them with your money to play the game? If you never layerers wanted to make a point you would refuse to sub until layering was gone. Voting one way with words and another way with your wallet is a sure way to playing games based on what makes the majority stick around, not necessarily what you want.
---
Lok'Tar O'Gar!!!!!!!!!

Nope, we're just the people who are going to a make a stink until the day comes that they remove it entirely.  Even then, you will take the opportunity to rub it in our face's that we finally got our way.  In the end, we will not be the heroes you want, but the heroes you deserve.
---
I disagree 100%
---
Oh no! I don’t know the difference I guess. My bad!
---
You people make me sick. The Classic team has been resounding in their response to the community and listening to their desires, you sound like whining children and you're the most dead-on examples I can cite to people in reference to what "entitled" mean. If you require the servers to crash to have a true authentic experience, I'd almost feel sorry for you if it weren't for the fact that you're basically spitting in the faces of the people working on a passion project for **YOU** to play that could have easily never happened at all in any form whatsoever. You're complaining about your prime cut of steak after you've eaten the same stale PB&amp;J that is retail for years now.
---
Even if you had a wormhole in your PC to literally play the real vanilla WoW back in the day, you still would somehow find something amiss, because I'm 100% convinced you people have an undocumented mental problem relating to nostalgia. If ***limited-time*** layering keeps you from playing Classic, I dare say the devs are gonna be over the moon that actual nutcases like you aren't going anywhere near it.  
---
 If you do plan on playing though, you better be playing on a mid-2000s piece of shit Gateway that barely gets a stable 17 FPS, if you can make the time in between your homework since you re-enrolled to your old high school. No changes, am I right?
---
Thank you for blocking out the streamer links &lt;3
---
I see your point, but streamers need the drama, and trying to overreact to killing boars and bears will lose subscribers in the long run
---
Believe the main reason it will be present for the first phase is due to server stability.
---
Depends on population if servers are triple the size of normal it will stay
---
People who play WoW dont't care about money they care about status. And streamers get insant status for no immediate effort. Thats why they are hated. Its essentially cheating in a game like WoW
---
The one vanilla video isn’t even clearly leeway as there is deadzone kiting and also being able to drop combat and vanish. The few instances he does get some long range hits in is cause of sprint and or server lag. 
---
The rest of the videos are post vanilla so you can toss those out.
---
Maybe my memory is mistaken but I do not recall leeway in vanilla being as big of a discrepancy compared to classic.
---
It made me realize how much I didn't like layers. Everything seemed so empty the whole time, but in reality there were a lot of people playing, you just couldn't see them.
---
I raided SW and IF and there were like 6 ally we saw the whole walk there and inside.
---
Does anyone know if abilities like ghostly strike and hemo are going to still be exempt from swing speed based AP normalizations like they were in vanilla? Ghostly strike with a 2.9 swing speed 1h weapon hit really hard because it used the full 2.9 multiplier instead of a normalized one (2.4 or 2.6, I forget)
---
i dont have a problem with raiding the other factions towns, but you really dont see an issue with him ninja looting because people did that in vanilla? Like that is the biggest dick thing you can do in the game.
---
Korn
---
Dunno, Indonesia’s got a pretty big population.
---
thanks!
---
So it's being fixed?
---
I just tested it 5 times in each location. I used no speed buffs at all from class spells/talents or gear. Just a simple level 1.
---
It took me an average of 23 seconds to get from SW Auction House (with the UI open) to the SW Banker (with the UI open). 
---
It took me an average of 17 seconds to get from the IF Auction House (with the UI open) to the IF Banker (with the UI open).
---
I don't think anyone is going to care about ~6 seconds if it means missing out on any world buffs and being further away from every raid instance until Naxx.
---
The reason IF was so popular in Vanilla is because SW didn't have an Auction House at all until AQ.
---
Should both cities have AH come aug 27?
---
Do you guys have the feeling that Blizzard actually thinks that a lot of Russians will resort to botting, or that there will be significant backlash from non-RUs that think you are cheaters, and so they are "quarantining" you as a pre-emptive measure?
---
Not trying to imply anything, btw, just that there's already some record on labeling you guys as such. I honestly have no idea if it's justified or not.
---
B I N G O !
---
Why would what they say matter if he doesn't trust what they say, LMFAO
---
...your argument being?
---
Cant say i remember people phasing in and out of the world when I played but its been years. 
---
Don’t you find World PvP to be one of the things that made WoW Vanilla what it was? Pre flying mounts everyone was in the same world with no easy escapes - thats what immersed me the most. If you wanted to farm elementals in Silithus you had to fight for that spot.
---
We should call it the multiple worlds of warcraft (depending on your layer)
---
Have you considered that maybe instead of everyone else being wrong, it might actually be you?
---
I wouldn't imagine it would be difficult to get an pinvite from someone in your guild, assuming layers work like like I think I do(you join leads layer).
---
&gt; Do you really think people will be able to find a group in another layer in the instant before you kill them?
---
It doesn't necessary have to involve avoiding death.  In theory it can be used to move from a layer where someone is killing a quest giver to another where no one is. I supposed the proper term is greifing? idk its been ages since i've played. 
---
OFC this is all going to depend on how the finer details are handled once it goes lives.
---
You know all those videos from private servers where guilds get all world buffed and another guild ganks them en route to a raid instance?
---
Not happening in Classic unless scrub guild, because pro guild will have an alt on another layer to reform raid 5 minutes prior and start summons with lock alts...
---
Yeah, I'm honestly sick of people like u/HiPNoTiX-
---
Him/Her and his ilk are partially responsible for how bad BFA turned out. The lion's share is obviously Blizzard, but there was **so much nuthugging** in BFA beta and blind faith in Blizzard.
---
Fuck that noise. Make a fuss, pitch a bitch, and do everything you can to drown out the fanbois who refuse to see the issues and/or remain faithful that Blizzard is the same company they were a decade ago.
---
Cue "You think you do, but you don't."
---
Cue "Do you guys not have phones."
---
The human race amazes me sometimes, this guy has contradicted himself at least twice in this thread but still complains openly, LOL
---
And nothing I said had anything to do with grouping to clear content. When you get to a point when you need teamwork to succeed, finding some buddies is great, and it makes the world feel alive. When you have to group just to complete kill x quests because of mob tagging, that feels tedious as hell. The majority of players have lives and don't want to spend 3x as long time played as should be necessary to level to 60 because of over population, or do all that work just to find out their server was mostly tourists and the only guild that raids is full up or toxic as hell. Those are actual problems that cost blizzard subs. For all the crying about layering, almost every single one of you will play classic. Hence, all the risk for blizzard is on the pro layer crowd, so they will likely ignore the anti layer crowd.
---
Yeah, every city should have an AH.
---
&gt; Then why are they commenting on other countless bugs?
---
You clearly don’t know how businesses work my dude
---
I dont think he was missing. The follow up to his original quest turns him into a frog or something. If you watch the video, you can see him pop right out of that creature. I think he was there bud!
---
That’s a hunter. Not to be confused with Sir Twenty Goodmen, whose a rogue that can take down an entire army. xxRamsayBoltonxx is a beastmaster hunter who’s pets get increased damage the longer he goes without feeding them, just don’t want to see how long you can push that though...
---
On alliance side server 3 we had Onyxia Whelps in Stormwind.
---
Y'all ever tried to do Defias Traitor escort with dynamic at max? Literally need a raid to keep pace with the fresh mobs.
---
Me?
---
You will learn.
---
&gt; Damn, some of the best times I've had are when we're barely able to communicate.
---
There's a difference between choice and forcing someone to speak something they can't. I'm going to go out on a limb here and say those interactions you've had were mainly with people who at least were interested in speaking English. Vanilla had specific Language servers, not all of them were there are the start granted, so those that chose to play on English servers largely were doing so by choice. 
---
Ultimately, Europe (specifically members of the EU-28) has a population of [408,879,069 above 15 (age). Out of those 51% speak English. 26% speak French. 32% speak German and 15% speak Spanish.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_the_European_Union)
---
All this choice is really going to do is alienate large portions of the playerbase in one way or another. You certainly wouldn't want to be on an unofficial X language server multiple months down the line (or perhaps you would, but most people that can't speak that language likely wouldn't in a social game).
---
Yeah I know. But I feel that’s different. They just wanted to gut everything and had all their eggs in the basket. Expansion betas are just here to make sure the game works, their new mechanics work. They aren’t going to do a sweeping overhaul if people don’t like something months before the launch. That’s the issues with those beta compared to classic, which is a re-release.
---
**Languages of the European Union**
---
The languages of the European Union are languages used by people within the member states of the European Union (EU).
---
The EU has 24 official languages, of which three (English, French and German) have the higher status of "procedural" languages of the European Commission (whereas the European Parliament accepts all official languages as working languages). One language (Irish) previously had the lower status of "treaty language" before being upgraded to an official and working language in 2007, although it has been temporarily derogated as a working language until 2021 due to difficulty finding qualified translators. The three procedural languages are those used in the day-to-day workings of the institutions of the EU. The designation of Irish as a "treaty language" meant that only primary legislation (the treaties) was to be translated into Irish, whereas secondary legislation (Directives and Regulations) did not have to be.

Streaming wasn't a thing back then though.  It's easy to /who a name and try and track them down to a zone (though I don't believe that actually works cross faction), but stream sniping gives you nearly real-time info on exactly where someone is, and their resources (cooldowns that are active, for example).

Streamers are almost going to have to play on PVE servers, or just risk getting constantly sniped.  Or consider taking the time off.
---
When they have something relevant to say about layering they will. If you're hoping they're going to not include layering I wouldn't hold my breath lol.
---
Dude. Layering still has that issue. 
---
Splitting 15k people among 8 layers STILL has that ridiculous overcrowded problem. That’s why half of us are scratching our collective heads. 
---
Layering introduces bugs AND still has that problem, AND applies to the world where endgame resources can be exploited. Simple sharding would’ve handled the initial rush better at least.
---
No, the OP
---
you're talking about sharding.  layering applies to entire continents and.  sharding would have to be brought over to accomplish this.  They effectively do the same thing, but apply in different ways.  If they were to do sharding, they would have to do it to where it doesn't mix servers.
---
Is there a way to do this on Firefox?
---
Tbf most people care about karma on reddit more than they should so defending streamers on this sub will be the karma-suicide equivalent of defending orange man on r/politics
---
&gt;Yes, they are.
---
Lets be clear, you have no clue. Blizzard has a team of people whose literal job is to gauge server load and decide how much capacity they need. And tbh they've done an extremely good job of that for the past 10 years. The one hiccup they had was in WoD launch and it was caused by a technical bug in a quest that basically made the players ddos the server. They're generally quite good at knowing how many people are going to play their game.
---
&gt;Classic WoW dropout rate will be MUCH LESS than private servers
---
Or it could be much, much higher due to it being far more accessible to an audience which isn't attached to it.
---
&gt;because of what i said until now, which are FACTS
---
They're not facts they are your opinion based on essentially nothing but your feelings as someone who plays the game and has no access to any of the metrics Blizzard does. You don't even know what Blizzard active subscriber base is right now or how its fluctuated over the past 2 months.
---
Thats a good point. But I hope it is a thing, if for no other reason, than to have 1. arcane viable. 2. 15 years of theory crafting of arcane being useless, proven wrong.
---
But I thought Blizzard was just in this for the money and didn't care about the game, according to all the doomsayers?
---
Why?
---
Me by my lonesome in the middle picture.
---
So much for #nochanges. /s
---
;-)
---
2% is like completely forgetting to equip a trinket lol. Of course you’ll notice it if you’re checking against a reference client.
---
Thats great and everything, and you make good points, but OP literally asked which city is most efficient while referencing Org's close bank/AH proximity.
---
So I answered his question.
---
Suuuuure they do buddy. Thats what the warlocks want us to think. 
---
Have you ever seen a warlock summon a doomguard or infernal in classic? Exactly what I thought.
---
Until the AQ patch, Ironforge was the only Alliance city with an Auction House. With Classic, SW will have an Auction House at launch.
---
Being that layers should only change when you group up, that really shouldn't be an issue for the plethora of people playing. Yeah, I get it, that guy from South Park will be hoping layers like a bunny rabbit to farm black lotus for his world first guild. However, the rest of us will be enjoying leveling and actually being able to do quests and joining guilds that will survive the flight of tourists a few months in. You're taking a problem that creates at most a few market issues in the first couple of months and comparing it to a world ending cataclysm that will ruin classic for everyone. At this point the focus should be on fixing bugs with layering, not changing it significantly or scrapping it entirely
---
Then why complain about silence???  You dont care what they have to say, but you'll whine when they don't say it?
---
I hope you realize how ridiculous that sounds.
---
That definitely won't be the case for all servers. There's communities right now trying to gather all the players from X country to pick an unofficial server. 
---
Some servers will be vastly dominated by German/French/Spanish. I highly doubt Blizzard is going to enforce a strict "English-only" rule as that would be foolish for a ton of different reasons. 
---
There's a reason vanilla had national servers for most of the big ones eventually.
---
I'd imagine if Firefox had Extensions. I haven't used it in years. I'd be surprised if it didn't.
---
I give up. :D
---
The internal revenue services didnt believe he was at 16.5k a year. So they audit and he owes interest on back taxes +taxes
---
No way. I live in Minnesota and get 120-170 ping to private servers in eastern europe.
---
Not saying you dont know this but I am pretty sure this was all done on purpose. There were many people on their own layers to test the functionality. Don't want people thinking this is how layers will work on launch
---
You type "Google chrome" into the search bar and download it.
---
From a statistical point of view, when checking a bunch of data based on random numbers for attacks, having a 2% margin of error isn't crazy.  Go flip a coin 100 times and let me know if you get exactly 50 of each.
---
You can't shitpost with 25 posts per second. They won't be read
---
Actually there is an easier way to say, it is an older word that is not very used in france anymore "nonante" but very popular in other french speaking countries like belgium, switzerland.
---
Why this exists is because the latins/romans used to count by 10(decimals) but celtic/normans  count by 20, and france went to the norman side since the midle age.
---
No I like his videos, thanks
---
Shadow is very popular in vanilla.
---
Recording a video of me reacting to this comment. Will upload soon.
---
I hope you are not referring to PVE, because mage's essentially boil down to spamming frostbolt in raids.  There's not much skill there.
---
Did he unlist his video ?
---
Humans tend to remember negative things more than positive things.
---
Just saying. Your personal perception does not always match reality.
---
I would be absolutely shocked if he did this for more than 2 weeks.  He’s been such a child about being stream sniped.  I like streamers, i watch Esfand and Cdew regularly...but these guys get all bent out of shape that people watch their stream to gank them...but never get mad at all the gold they get sent...or that hundreds of gamers are willing to drop whatever they are doing to run a dungeon with them even though they’re only pursuing a single item for esfand.  They’ll take the perks but when it comes to the negatives they’re outraged.  
---
You cannot take the good and not the bad.
---
Imagine thinking Sodapoppin's multiple R1 glads given to him and required no immediate effort.
---
Layering is just sharding on a continent level. Renaming it was a very successful PR move to get away from the stigma of "sharding".
---
I bet you think minimum wage increases are always a good thing as well.
---
&gt;because they're popular that makes them good
---
No they're just way more normie friendly and popular now. Just because the avengers movies are popular and make a lot of money doesn't make them good. We're a niche community that appreciates the game in its original vision. The game was originally designed with a more hardcore fanbase in mind. After they achieved massive success they sold out that community for $$$
---
Repost
---
Since they were testing various layer stuff, I'd expect there were some people that had packed layers and others that were barren.
---
realm 3 was a ghost town. /who showed only 1-2 other people in my layer typically. but there was like 30 people in that zone.
---
Okay.  But why would everyone forsake IF? It’s set up far better than SW.  And people still think of it as the capital.
---
PvE servers are typically 60/40 Alliance/Horde ratio by nature and 12 wasn't the most popular by any means.
---
Dood common. Why cant you be like everyone else and complain about something 😁
---
Hunter: Tank, we’re all out of mobs...
---
Warrior: Then pull MOOOORRRE!!!
---
can people ~35 and under really not speak English in the EU? Hasn't English been a required course in schools for decades now?
---
i think it's obnoxious how all the "Blizzard can do no wrong" people swarm to these threads to downplay these bugs. when you combine this with the totem bug, with possibly other bugs we haven't found yet, it is possible that Classic is indeed undertuned like people are saying. you can yap all you want in other threads, but please, keep your nonsense out of these threads.
---
 The comparison really isn't accurate, people die while leveling because they get bored and want to level faster so they pull more mobs and they die. Dark Souls presents you with challenging content in which you have to figure out the mechanics in order to progress.
---
Retail has a more widespread level of difficulty, leveling was never challenging in either version, one just is slower, one is faster. The margins of challenge there are small at best. End game retail has at the same time vastly easier content, like pet battling , LFR and vastly more difficult content like M+ and Mythic Raids.
---
Best choice popular streamers can make. If you can't deal with the heat, get outta the kitchen.
---
And to the plebs backing them. They don't deserve preferential treatment. You stream  your game with 10s of thousands of followers, take the bad along with the good. There's way more good than bad.
---
Or actually take the best choice and add a minute delay to your stream. But they won't even sacrifice a little.
---
And that is because of their ego and lust for fame/fomo from streaming, that won't let this happen. I'd bet anything that he will not follow through.
---
&gt; majority of language servers
---
Which ones weren't there? There were German servers, French servers. After a few months Spanish and Russian servers. [51% speak English. 26% speak French. 32% speak German and 15% speak Spanish.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_the_European_Union) so they did have the biggest ones covered for most of vanilla.
---
Roll out - Luda
---
not being able to speak english in 2019 lul
---
I'm with you man, keeping the integrity of how classic was is a must. Everyone implementing modern techniques from bfa is annoying and a nuisance
---
They're not your friends
---
I got most of it recorded! If there's enough interest I'll upload it and link it here :)
---
Yes, classic is a lot smaller than retail. Keep in mind it doesn't need to have assets for all the expansions, some classes, etc.
---
Whether it's worthwhile or not is up to you. If you have the sub, might as well try it out and see.
---
It's weird because it said it was "medium" population but Barrens was a ghost town.
---
Even more strange was that certain sub-areas had lots of people in them while the rest of the zone didn't. Like that area northeast of Crossroads with all the quillboars, there were plenty of people over there, but everywhere else in the zone, I'd be lucky to pass by another person every 5 minutes or so.
---
I feel like blizzard is dragging their feet into this because they know it's going to overtake modern WoW which will once and for all prove that every change they've made over the years was a mistake and the community was right all along.
---
This ended too soon.
---
They're all closing after classic release, so.....
---
Lol why am I not the champion in this one? Waahhh
---
Embrace toxity, repel the normies
---
I was there for that but I only saw down to 20% till I got d/ced nice to know we won!
---
What's possible?   There's still a set # of items per server based on population.
---
And was that because they added multiple servers into one?
---
SW is closer to MC, Onyxia, Kazzak, Azuregos, BWL, the Darkmoon Faire, ZG, and AQ.
---
It's also the only city where you get world buffs.
---
I can see the appeal of pvp for a dps class, or a good shadow priest. But I just enjoy healing a lot more than killing I guess. At least my history on the private pvp realm left me pretty frustrated
---
God damn that's a good feel
---
Walk away for 5-10 minutes and they usually get bored and leave.
---
Or GM's can step in tell people to move on.
---
Barrens is a huge zone. There is several quests in the area you described, not really surprised by what you are saying. Also, they were testing layers so you may have been on a pretty empty one.
---
not rly, cuz they're gonna be speaking in broken english and that's fine :)
---
Axe spec here we goooo.
---
i am not in the beta so i cant report it so i made a reddit post to get some attention on the matter
---
It honestly feels like the pet commands just have a crazy long tick rate, like they are only carried out every 1/2 a second. This may be intentional to keep the server ticks at a minimum right now but it felt really bad when I was playing hunter in the stress test.
---
&gt; already niche classic crowd between EU and US, we're gonna divide it further into half a dozen languages and then AGAIN between horde and alliance
---
How niche? This sub alone has 142K subscribers. By no means a great statistic, but that's roughly 71K "hardcore" European players (anyone who actively browses this will be far more active than the average player). You can't tell me they can't sustain a ~5K server if they have one for the biggest (German/French/Spanish) languages. 
---
And even then, they could offer those few servers a realm merge down the line which would be a lot better than having people gamble at launch if you ask me.
---
There are different levels
---
Something else that is also overlooked, that is in agreement with your points about having consistent people involved in your leveling experience (and why cross-realms was a step backwards) is that layering is static. That means if you are on layer 3, you will always be on layer 3, until they start removing layers. 
---
Yes, you can jump to a different layer with a group invite, and yes, that is jarring. If it were permanent, I would be right there with you on this. There are tons of ways to exploit layers, and people will. However, this will be when the *fewest* amount of people are at max level, when it is *least* beneficial to layer hop. Is this ideal? Of course not, but when you look at the advantages it brings for launch, I think the pros outweigh the cons.
---
Except literally nothing happened in this video.
---
it's "proof" that you can exploit layering by simply changing layers.
---
He never changes layers.
---
the same guy killed him a minute after this clip.
---
well it also affects windfury and since i go horde its a rather big deal^^
---
Oh okay, great, thanks for clearing that up man! 
---
 
---
Hey guys, it's totally fine, Blizz won't fuck it up this time like they did for the last couple of years because /u/HiPNoTiX said so, so just shut your mouths and stop all that critical thinking. Everything is great.
---
[so you're either a gullible idiot or blizzard's tool](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/legion-numbers-are-being-used-in-classic-proof/204023)

&gt; No I don’t think anyone is angry at Soda for abusing the system
---
NOTHING WAS ABUSED!
---
Literally nothing happened
---
He did not avoid being killed in WPVP, the same guy killed him a minute after this clip.
---
The world is not falling.
---
Nationalism, not globalism
---
&gt; do you really think they aren’t going to change a thing about it, and that they aren’t going to use it for as short as absolutely necessary?
---
"With all the feedback that's been provided during beta do you really think they aren't going to change a thing about it?" &lt; BFA Beta to live. This is new Blizzard we're talking about. Nothing is off the table as far as them completely ignoring feedback and doing whatever they want.
---
Wish there was raid schedules at siesta times, spanish realms raid from 22:00 to 1:00
---
Not playing on whatever realm Asmongold will be playing at is a nice quick fix to that,
---
\&gt;  That Blizzard admitted wrongdoing   
---
Are we so jaded as to be impressed by Blizzard acknowledging an obscure attack formula bug? I get it, BfA is rough and everyone doesn't trust Blizzard as much as they used, but I mean jesus.
---
&gt; What about the other languages ?
---
Realistically there's just not enough people to sustain all of that. A lot of countries won't have issues with English due to their education/media (Benelux, Scandinavian). [Hungarian speaking adult Europeans, for instance, only make up 3%. Versus the 32% German, 26% French and 15% Spanish speakers.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_the_European_Union)
---
Remember back when this wasnt a thing? Such a good time then!
---
&gt;  That Blizzard admitted wrongdoing
---
Its common knowledge at this point, i’ll be surprised if I can kill a dude twice before he switches layers..
---
Its going to be widely used, maybe not to gather but to avoid World PvP for sure.
---
Such excellent info for my Bear Drood.  I need my macros to change via what form im in and have been limited to the 1 main hotbar that does it automatically.  I have know I needed to address this problem before launch &amp; wasn't sure how.  Thank you so much.
---
You'll have more fun playing with your friends and people you know. Just do an alt Alliance on another server.
---
September 20 is the last day of Summer
---
If you dont help save lives as the emergency, I'd get a new job.
---
Question will they fade away? The wow originals played for years. Do we feel the streamers will do the same or eventually die out with their viewers moving to new games?
---
Classic is Coming™
---
&gt; And yet, people are still defending layering.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; LOOK. LOOK AT IT.
---
Look at what?
---
LITERALLY NOTHING HAPPENED.
---
Soda joined a group.
---
Soda stayed on the same layer.
---
Literally 1 minute later, soda died to the same guy in WPVP.
---
So layering means a bored WPVP player will run 50 yards away, and by happenstance, run 50 yards back, see you, then kill you?
---
Yeah raids not so much, you can definitely influence dungeons with your non-poly CC abilities.. healer takes aggro? Frost Nova the mob in place and let the healer move away. 
---
Ice Block lets you cheese Jandice Barov a fair bit. CoC let’s you kite etc
---
What is this, a screen for ants?!
---
Do raids tend to have every mage as Frost, or will they stick one or two on Fire (is there different gear for Fire mages anyway?) when not on MC/
---
Either even the layers out automatically or don't bother with layers at all IMO.
---
I saw the same issue. Some layers were jam packed and others were empty.
---
Filthy alliance
---
&gt; We would overwhelmingly rather some try hard neck beards get a head start on black lotus spawns than not be able to play the game until phase 2.
---
And here is the best part, they aren't just going to fucking stick 10 layers on every sever, they are specifically adding layers as server population demands, aiming to keep it as close as possible to 1 layer per ideal realm population.
---
So that argument it pure distilled undiluted bullshit.  The black lotus spawns will still be the same per population.
---
They are just butthurt their plan to mafia camp the lotus and devilsaurs, because they were hoping the prices would skyrocket given the same limited supply and the expected sextupling of demand.
---
Sharding
---
What zones specifically? Horde side was 50+ for every starting/followup zone.
---
Predicted what?
---
The guy who killed Soda left.
---
Soda did not change layers.
---
The guy came back and killed Soda like a minute after this clip ended.
---
LITERALLY NOTHING HAPPENED HERE.
---
I did this quite some time ago. Youtube is a website I can visit again. So nice.
---
Afaik, there's not unlimited layers, only enough to meet the demands of the population. So theoretically, even if that guy gets away, (which a lot of people will just log if you kill them repeatedly anyways) someone new will come into your layer when you log in. Also seems layer hopping is pretty tedious unless you have a large selection of people that can help you hop, which early on many people won't.
---
Farm enough gold to buy a WoW Token. Shouldn't take more than ~12 hours at level 110. Then your foray into the Stress Test was free!
---
2” and 3-5’ are pretty massive differences in distance.
---
80% of Death Knights on patch 3.0
---
That’s just aging in general
---
And he has some dogs
---
You're an idiot, RichTurpin changed layer too.
---
Literally 0 layering issues are present in this video.
---
The guy who killed him simply did not camp the body.
---
He killed Soda like a minute later elsewhere.
---
This is 100% a nonissue.
---
Layering presents issues in terms of economy and gameplay.
---
Giving players who exploit it unfair advantages,
---
As the guy above said, it is a legitimate issue.
---
There are different levels of "badness" here, it is not a black and white issue as you suggest it to be.
---
Laying is not the best solution to this problem, it is just the easiest for Blizzard to implement.
---
I'll have to look into it for Firefox. His reaction videos takes up half my recommendation list after watching one classic video.
---
As someone who has seen a lot of his content, Asmon is facetious almost 100% of the time. When he complains about things like that, he's not being serious. It's part of his persona
---
&gt;I suck Blizzards dick because I have given them so much of my time and money that I NEED them to be right about everything because otherwise O feel like it's all been a waste. That's why I defend all the shit they pull and call everybody who's off the kool-aid a 'hater'.  
---
  
---
- /u/shananigins96, 2019
---
 I was agreeing with what you said, so...
---
Well then...this probably isnt for you is it?
---
From my understanding, flasks are not considered necessary til BWL anyways. Could just be hyperbole, but if that's the case, only cutting edge guilds(who will probably be the ones doing that cheap stuff anyways) will really need black lotus. By the time BWL is out prices should drop a lot
---
No one will care that much about mining nodes, definitely gonna be some Black Lotus farmers.  Devilsaur leather mafias gonna show the world what layering exploits look like though.
---
Imagine making over 400k a year from subscriptions alone, without counting tips, ads and merchandising, and never bother spending pocket change hiring an accountant to do your taxes.

But hunter is fast. And also known for doing that

This should be expected in a stress test
---
 mages who levels 60 by aoe grinding, how do you fix reputation levels ? let's say an undead mage, leveled to 20, then grind to 60, how to increase reputation levels in orgrimmar?
---
That's still a huge problem. Why they didn't just host many more servers and merge them as they die off is beyond comprehension
---
I think this is a cyclical thing.
---
Oh yeah, I was just talking about leveling. High level people were more picky.
---
There are more reasons to dislike sodapoppin than simply because he's a popular streamer. He's kind of an ass. The dueling tournament would have been far better off without him trying to force his will on everyone.
---
Hey's still going to attract an in game following of rabid fans. Not streaming will help mitigate it though, which is nice.
---
Let's be honest here, it's about jealousy and the money they make.  Soda is a true OG streamer been streaming wow since 2009 and when he started streaming no one made money from it and it was not known.  He did it for the fun of it and got thousands of viewers without making any money for his first three years streaming wow.  Now he's officially a millionaire because of how long he has done it with twitch blowing up and people are so obsessed with that just show's how jealous they are.  How many times on twitter or reddit people break off topic to mention he is a millionaire is crazy to me.  I could care less if he is a millionaire playing video games or he get's free wow stuff in the mail from fans.  I'm thankful I have no jealous bone in my body because it's pointless to spend any part of your day stressing yourself over something that does not effect you playing the game.

Several and few are not the same thing.
---
That's why it's cooler to be from the Americas. Latin-American spanish-speakers actually sound sexy.
---
Oh, simple enough.
---
At the start of the clip you can hear him asking someone to make a level 1 night elf (because night elves start in kalimdor and like I said you need an invite from someone on the same continent to layer hop) but he gets invited instantly so it probably legitimately surprised him 
---
He seemed to react the same way as anyone who would be randomly invited so I don't know why you think he was feigning ignorance, either way it's kinda weird to judge someone off a 30 second clip then say you don't watch any streamers 
---
Either way it'll probably be better if you stopped watching clips of them too with such a cynical outlook :)
---
Your English or grammar may be off. I dont understand

I remember the crocs from wrath. But I dont remember any other spots sadly

I looked into this using multiple browsers, multiple PCs and different OS and I couldn't replicate any kind of slowdown unfortunately. It could be related to a browser extension not playing nicely or any number of things.

If you get any more information, do send us a modmail, and we can look into it further.
---
It doesn't make sense to you because you assume these people hate streamers out of concern for the health of the game and not just because it feels good.

Diary of Jane by Breaking Benjamin
---
I think the economic impact is a fair point, but I think it will only effect a small percentage of people compared to everyone being affected by over population week 1 through 6 and then sudden population decline afterwards leaving some servers dead. It's really less black and white and more pick your poison. Layering seems to be the easiest to get rid of, and will affect less people overall imo. Again, I'm no wow economist, so I accept that the economy could be more affected than I surmise, but from the way I see it, I would rather have layering, hopefully without the bugs
---
Mostly Durotar, touched barrens a little bit, but had absolutely no problem tagging mobs and doing quests all the way to 15. Game felt literally empty - tried to get invited to another layer but found that difficult also.
---
*MY MY MY, Delilah!*
---
Yeah right, what even was Nostalrius?
---
But you won't be able to understand anyone or find anyone to group with because the remaining 30% aren't all English speaking only 5% are.
---
Do you have some evidence?
---
🤷🏾‍♀️ So what? I’m honestly surprised how people are getting upset over laying. 
---
I’m pretty sure Blizzard has made there position quite clear. They are going for the cheapest server maintenance possible by offering only a few limited classic realms, no language separation and full automate support. 
---
I wouldn’t be surprised to see like three PvP, two PvE and a single RP server for North America/Europe with one of each server for Russian users and maybe a single PvE server for Australia with opinions to play on either North America/Europe as an alternative.
---
Gotcha thanks for the compelling reasoning!
---
Especially frustrating because as much as this was a stress test for Blizzard, I wanted to see how my old as shit potato PC could handle that many people in one place.
---
These are the revamped zones from cataclysm. The story you are seeing is from cata as well.
---
Well then thats why it was so empty.. of course everyone was participating in the event on the other server.
---
By far more, it was around 8% in the most extreme example and around 4% on others.
---
English structure certainly resembles German more than it does French though, even if a lot of vocab is rooted in French.
---
&gt;I don't get it. If you guys hate streamers, shouldn't you be happy about this? 
---
I'm happy about this.
---
&gt;solo fast grind all the way to 110 with no relief
---
Basically this. In fact it gets more and more tedious the higher you get since your character basically stops progressing.
---
I like the global approach, find it much more inclusive tbh
---
Vanilla had German and French servers. It also had Spanish and Russian ones after a few months. So no, this wouldn't be accurate to that. Granted, that doesn't cover every country/language and some are simply too small to work out (like there's roughly 3% Hungarian speaking adults in the EU28). So yeah, vanilla absolutely had those stories but it depends on which period (e.g. There were some heavily dominated unofficial Spanish servers around launch until transfers later down the line) and it's often not the biggest ones for good reason.
---
Should i be able to heal raids and scholo/ubrs?
---
It seems like my face tbh
---
&gt; One also wonders how this fits the forum mantra of 'they have the 1.12 server running for comparison.'
---
This is really what had me raising my eyebrows as well.
---
The whole idea of "Just trust us we are comparing values." always seemed to be a bit disingenuous. What kind of extensive play testing is taking place to verify all of these kind of systems.
---
Now with all that being said on something like a Patchwerk fight a 7% average difference on yellow damage might be a 1 to 2% difference in total dps in comparison. So technically it's something they may have been within a margin of error on the low end, on the high end though 2% seems like that would exceed that kind of margin......
---
The only thing that ruined the tournament was the same faction griefing by level 1s.

During the Mists of Pandaria beta, they scrapped like *half* of the Jade Forest and remade it. That was pretty huge and I remember being very surprised by them deciding to go through with that. And that wasn't even because it was a bad zone, just mediocre and the team wasn't happy with their intro experience for the expansion being mediocre.
---
So I wouldn't say never. Just... not recently. I was in BfA beta, and I'll say that the experience has filled me with some level of despair.
---
yeah raids and dungeons are easily healable as 30/0/21. Some people will want you to have mana tide for raids, but its more than doable esp mc / bwl without it.
---
What if the population doesn't die down lol
---
Sheesh I bet you’re the meanest girlfriend there is/ever was.
---
You were in a low pop layer. I was in layer 15 and it was packed to the point where every single mob in the NE starting area was being camped.
---
Oh, ha, thanks!
---
i think a major concern would be people who multibox this. They could cut back on the 20 second logout time by having another account up that invites people, and while they loot, the multiboxer is swapping to another layer, then reinviting, rinse and repeat. you could farm 5+ of those nodes per minute. Not that it would be THAT crazy but still something that gold farmers could take advantage of if done correctly. I dont think we will see this go away because layering will be needed to have a smoother launch however i hope blizzard sticks true to getting rid of layering as soon as possible.
---
Faith restored for the next gen. Lok’tar ogar!
---
And having to restart the final duel because Tipsout-the-government-defrauder was running ads on his stream.
---
well, it’s basically the same experience since you’re still 18-19.
---
I'd like to think my vocabulary is a little bit higher than that but okay. Now to address your flaming. 
---
Blizzard has gutted wow in retail. I haven't touched BFA since one month after launch and I'm not going back to play 8.2. They made terrible decisions with Diablo Immortal being their big announcement at Blizzcon, abandoned HOTS (which I loved) and SC2 has been largely untouched other than a few COOP commanders and light patching. Those are all terrible decisions made by Blizz. 
---
The only reason I think layering is fine is because I haven't heard a better solution to the problems it addresses. Telling people they should enjoy grinding to 60 because questing is over saturated is a retarded argument that gets posted way too often. And you are haters. You don't care about what's best for the game and the community, you just hate layering because of some exploits and #nochanges. So thanks for proving the point.
---
Wish I had a dollar for every time I heard someone say this about a game before it launches and it isn't changed. Most of the time very little changes from 2 months before launch.
---
To clarify I'm not saying it guaranteed *won't* change.
---
You can yell all you want for those Alliance filth. They wont save you!
---

Looks like all you toxic people got what you wanted: https://twitter.com/Sodapoppintv/status/1142243530443841538
---
Warriors and rogues would get raped by the level 15 harvest watchers
---
&gt;But I will be way more upset if they scrap it altogether and I have to use half my time I could be playing waiting to actually login and the other half waiting on the crowd to die down just to do quests
---
Then maybe you should play bfa or some other mmo that didn't advertise a legit classic wow experience. That's how it was back then and I and tons of other people are totally fine with that. You clearly don't want the original experience - which is okay - but why tf aren't playing other games that cater to your needs?
---
Other players have suggested betters ways to handle the issue which do not involve the exploit type of behavior.
---
People who advocate against layering aren't advocating for no changes, may of them recognize there are better potential solutions to the problem.
---
I think a guild would be all you need.. “looking for layer hope inv me plz”
---
Hardware differences will make it impossible to feel the same, right?
---
The realm list said the population of the server was high. There were heaps of people listed in /who. I just couldn't see most of them.
---
Even when they had that American pre-christmas thing happening out there it wasn't off/on like the vid. There was pop in but not nopeople/people light switch
---
Feels like rapid formation of a stereotype. Too many variables to even be coherent.
---
In the specific context we all know about they can be the same. We don't know if a few weeks will be 2 or 6. zzzz
---
[49% of adults in the EU28 don't speak English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_the_European_Union). Granted, that statistic will be skewed more favorably among gamers I'm sure, but how is that more inclusive? The big ones have their own clients and translations already. Historically, they'll form insular communities. From personal experience, it seems idealistic but unrealistic to hope this leads to a positive outcome for the majority.

How about a macro to turn Auto-Attack into "ON Only" instead of toggle ON/OFF.  Been looking for this &amp; cant find much.  I hate accidentally turning my auto attack off during combat.

---
Perhaps WoW isn't the place.
---
Would not work with Black lotus as it is a random spawn in like  locations in each zone. They will not spawn in the same location on all layers at the same time. 
---
Another argument. Each Vanilla server had about 3K active users each night with maybe 10-15K population. With Layering each layer will have 3K active ppl with a much higher cap on the server 50K-100K?. So more supply will be met by more demand.
---
It's a really good painting.
---
Well said.
---
I think it's foolish to believe such a massive corporation would be driven by such a level of pride. That's the sort of logic an individual may follow, not a money-oriented business. If they're dragging their feet, it's because they have doubts on the profitability, not because they're scared of being proven wrong.
---
I remember everything I did when I was little, it’s going to be a better experience cuz I’ll actually understand the game and not make a new character everytime I hit lvl 20😂
---
Nah, they wil just layer away from you....
---
That implies they have the infrastructure to do so at any given time.  They are doing layering to save on that cost in the first place.  These two things clash by nature.
---
They lied about sharding in starting zones only as well. They gotta earn that trust back.
---
Well if instant attacks aren't weapon normalized this would also mean that faster weapons are doing less damage than they should.
---
I can't remember the exact threshold, but I know it varies for Daggers vs One Handers vs Two Handers vs Ranged Weapons. I think it's 3.3 weapon speed for 2h weapons.
---
This means a Warrior using a 2.7 speed 2h axe is doing less dps than they should (even though they shouldn't be using such a fast weapon but bare with me for this example). 
---
So in theory this bug can cause instant attacks to
---
deal more OR less damage depending on weapon speed.
---
It's good for the masses and abused by the few. Seems they should implement a system like - someone hops layers 5 times in an hr, flag em for system abuse. Maybe a 5 hr ban or something.
---
Given enough time mushrooms will grow on anything
---
How would this be due to layering? walking into a capital wouldn't put you on a new layer, this is just phasing.
---
Because I enjoy the playstyle of a classic mmorpg? There's a difference between seeing other players in a zone and missing a few mobs to tags and waiting 3 hours to complete a kill quest because of over saturation. Your entire point there is disingenuous to my argument and misrepresenting what layering is there for. Besides, classic isn't just for people who played it in 2004. It's for everyone who wants to experience the game the way it used to be. Why would blizz purposefully destroy their new cash cow by making it unfun for all the new people playing too? Classic is about community and rpg gameplay, not about login queues and grinding
---
My experience was the exact opposite, but I was on the Alliance on the other PVE server (12).  It was ruthless in the starting zone (Northshire Abby), the only way to tag mobs and complete quests was in groups and it still literally took hours to complete them. Picture an ant hill that has been kicked.
---
The only layering experience I noticed was early Friday a.m. (US) when I started my second trip to 15 as. NE. There was a point when I died and ran back to my corpse along with 4-5 other whisps and suddenly instead of 1-2 mobs the zone had been repoped entirely, like a fresh start.
---
It did seem like the server was lower poped in the early morning hours so it is possible that playing in Australia might have been a part of the issue you had.
---
Only normie sheep like his videos
---
??? It's a bug, bro
---
His personality is really exhausting, no idea why hes so popular. Watched his stream once a couple weeks ago and he was just going on and on about how he handles conflict and how people are trashtalking him in his chat. Like for hours. The guy is just so boring.
---
I wish it wasnt so damn confusing. Hurts my head ughhhh
---
More importantly something like a 50 ilvl difference.
---
Thanks for sharing! Enjoy and be safe!
---
Chat-eww
---
It will. More importantly, that population will spread out. Layering's main purpose is to assist in the time when *everyone* is in starting zones. When people are split across many different zones, it's not nearly as necessary.
---
Disclaimer: I believe layering or sharding should be extremely temporary, like maximum two weeks. I do think *some* measure is necessary at the very beginning though.
---
It’s actually really starting to annoy me how important he is to the classic scene. He’s literally becoming the face of classic and I don’t want to see it anymore. Can I have one day where I don’t hear his name or see his face?
---
I gave him fifteen minutes and noped him after that. He eerily looks like someone I grew up with. It's uncanny.
---
If you follow my instructions you too can have relieving sighs of breathe
---
It doesn't have to be about pride. I can very much imagine classic reaching a critical mass where all the casual players switch over to follow the community. If classic subscriptions actually surpassed retail how would they explain that to their shareholders? It would be very embarrassing for the company.
---
Ok cool so what
---
Layering's *purpose* is to assist with overcrowding, which becomes less of an issue as people spread out across zones. The technical functions of it aside, it loses much of its *purpose* as time goes on.
---
Haha that poor guy
---
I already have, thanks for your help
---
Did you read the OP? I said I did a /who and there was 20 people in the entire zone.
---
Must have been the Horde side, the Alliance was ruthless in Northshire Abby. You literally had to group to tag mobs and complete quests and it still took hours to complete them all. Picture an anthill that has been kicked, that’s how it looked.
---
I'm going to stream and if this happens I will accept my fate.
---
They'd report "hey, our WoW subscriber count went up." If it's a financial success, that's all the shareholders are gonna give a shit about. They don't even need to delve into specifics with this one, because modern and classic have the same subscription.
---
Sure is fun playing an empty shard...
---
I haven't seen any solutions that tackle both sides of the problem. 
---
Sharding fixes saturated zones but leaves depopulation after launch alone, meaning servers will die and people will have to merge, something many people want to avoid. 
---
Having large servers will fix the latter but many people will have to take several more weeks to be able to play in a non grindy way, and server queues will kill group play with friends. 
---
At worst, layering will be exploited by the top end players for a couple of months and then disappear forever. I really struggle to see how either of those two are better than that. 
---
If you have other suggestions I'm willing to listen though.
---
With all due respect, i was the one carrying people half the time. I hit rank 10, full Tier 2, and more. WoW is not a game that really requires quick reflexes, particularly as a Druid.
---
Could you imagine if we get to Patchwork and he just one shots tanks and blizzard says this is how it was?
---
Based on what I've been reading, I'm expecting druid to be much more popular this time around.  Still low, but more than before.
---
Nope layered to shit.
---
Maybe. But a lot of people won't join guilds right away. Hopefully blizz is smart and tries to mitigate this issues before launch
---
oh
---
Definitely not. Used to see duelers when you round the corner
---
If the government announced tomorrow that starting the day after, a man would come to your house three times a day and kick you in the balls as hard as he can, but it's just a temporary measure and it'll stop after a couple of weeks, would you raise hell over that? Surely not, because you'll never have to care about it again after it's over, right?
---
They listened because of complaints. Don't use cynicism as a catch-all.
---
Layering is to reduce stress on the hardware, not to save costs on infrastructure, any player can \who to get how many players are on each zone, blizz should have the data.
---
I’m in the screenshot!! Hah dad look at me now!!!
---
Well people can layer hop pretty easily apparently. Language specific layers lol!
---
This is why I will main hunter in classic.
---
I feel Northern Europeans and North Americans have a distorted view of the importance of English in the world. It's very important sure, but far from ubiquitous, especially in latin America/Asia and French Africa.

I cant remember if this was vanilla or tbc, but there was the epic "the unstoppable force" 2h mace i believe. Then there was a grey hammer that dropped randomly called "the stoppable force" made me crack up lol
---
It's good feedback though. Blizz can always tweak the layers to include more people and luckily they're testing it instead of just leaving it as is
---
This should be stickied. But seriously though, awesome video!
---
Im in the same boat, played since ~4 or 5 (parents were into it and liked the idea of me farming fish while they worked) and now I’m gonna get a chance to re-experience it with an actual brain
---
The real titles are in the comments
---
Yeah if you missed out on lore those island quests would make no sense. I love orcs and even I hated Garrosh!
---
Layers are 10000% bullshit. I can understand them being applied to the starting zone but outside that? Nope. Really ruins it. Walking into the capital for the first time and seeing it bustling with activity is an experience that layering will absolutely rob from the playerbase. 
---
It's an abomination in its current form.
---
Stream sniping = Okay
---
Switching Layers to avoid constant stream sniping = Not okay
---
Interesting

Didn't affect the final at all. Keep grasping at straws to justify your hate.

I think it’s your atrocious reading comprehension acting up.

I don't really know that much about it but you can find a little more about it here, https://www.wowhead.com/news=291722/layering-in-classic-wow hope it helps
---
If your only asking about Bank and AH, SW and IF are about the same. If you include crafting, particularly Smithing and Engineering, IF is far better.
---
Remember, it only takes a minute or two to take the tram from IF to SW if you want to get to a raid.
---
I think it's just more realistic to think people will quit down the line. Hope for the best, prepare for the worst as they say. I would rather having layering early on than have to merge a server and lose names, guilds, etc.
---
This isn't exclusive to Classic, take a look at the general forums &amp; it's just as bad.
---
The good news is that these forum communities are just a small angry minority and it's never as bad once you're actually in game.
---
How does having to restart a duel where the players used cooldowns not have an effect? You're delusional.

No bro. It's terribly put together. If you understood it then great job.
---
That was TBC. Sold for a good bit of gold, too.
---
If you’re in a borderline ‘shared’ section then it’s possible the server is sampling your location and returning one of two locations. I’m no expert in this department, just saying that travelling a bit always resolved it for me.
---
Good attempt, don't let this failure stop you.  It's not completely terrible . . But it's a bit fucked honestly.
---
&gt;It's for everyone who wants to experience the game the way it used to be.
---
But you're obviously not one of those people, because you *don't* want it to be **the way it used to be**, you want it your way. You're the one being disingenuous when you're calling people selfish who want to get the original experience while you're pushing to have the game changed in ways that make it more enjoyable for *you*. Do you honestly not see how backwards that is?
---
I was on realm 3 horde and didn't have issues seeing people where I was but I also had no issues getting tags in either. Probably only saw 5 people in mulgore before heading out to durotar to meet up with friends again only saw a handful of people there too. Was still easily able to group for quests without having to ask in chat though.
---
Will do

I just read it again. It’s perfectly fine.

It won't be in Classic. The client no longer supports that kind of automation.

I fudged up some papers on my uni HECS stuff and had angry creditors calling me up for 5.5k a few months out of high-school. They were pretty much harassing me and I told them I couldn't help..

Getting calls from them 24/7 making demands I obviously can't fulfill has turned me off answering phones for randoms. I feel like they are just going to start blasting me and I don't want that.
---
loading boarder. as people said barrens and duration river its super obvious. basically it unloads things i thinks you wont see  or in another zone. this is actually part of why a lot of zone boarders you cant see over. like for example deathknell into tirisfall you walk around a wall. org walls in Z formation. its all to stop you from seeing this exact effect.   
---
its super annoying as a zone border because sometimes things like herbs or enemies spawn over the border and as you cross they despawn and are unreachable.
---
i couldnt tell you which spots were in vanilla and which are new but thats exactly whats happening in this example your crossing a border and the game goes oh now you need to see these people. and unlike most places with middle loading zones (the Z corridors in org and other spots) their arnt walls between you and whats in front of you so you visually can see the transition
---
Word is they had different layering on different servers.
---
I am going to assume that layer 3 had extreme layering, I was ally side on 3. Day one I saw a good amount of people in Elwynn. Day two and three I had much the same experience you did. No one anywhere. Even when /who would bring up others. I was at least able to group and see people so there is that.

It's not abuse this is a beta it's meant to test these things and their limits. Fuck sake. They know it's not ideal take a chill pill and let them address it, it's not a simple solution like you all assume it is.
---
They were being normalized but to the wrong numbers.  For 2h they were being normalized to legion's 3.6 instead of vanilla's 3.3.
---
Wow people still say Sike? Haha
---
That's not an addon.
---
Guild.master back in the day had yayocazm, and his friend was nosecandy. Nosecandy was reported and changed, but they never got Yayocazm.
---
Yea now imagine a raid with 18 melee doing 700 on average.. you're looking at an extra 504 dps. It's basically like bringing an extra player to the raid. And considering at 60 there is going to be a lot more crit gear it's probably going to be above 4% on average.
---
It is bigly useful.

Where is this video? I’ve been waiting!
---
I have horde ink &amp; haven’t really even touched alliance since mop, but I might still end up maining Alliance side for classic for the PVE scene. 
---
Definitely not because I miss being a cute little gnome or anything...
---
Yeah. I main horde but played more ally during the stress test. Lots of good groups and general chat. Most people were a pleasure.
---
Yep, completely new fresh launches with the nightmareish 5k in tirisfal experience and usual (at least on priv servers its usual) server crashes and stuff. 
---
There were some really controversial stuff too in some of the occasions where a few guild found some new way to break the game tho giving the private sever community a good laugh and a mew meme like the 1200 warlock dps. 
---
As far as i know manx of the week 1 kills are fully uploaded on youtube or vods on twitch
---
We’re hoping to see some more bugfixes in the next few weeks. 
---
If you are playing try to keep your pet on defensive not passive, this helps avoid one of the bigger issues.
---
Yeah man you got me. Superb argumentative abilities dude. Grade A intelligence right here.
---
As always each time new content comes out(each phase) their views will peak then go down, once all phases are over theyll decline until TBC gets announced and so the cycle will go on.

Depending on the streamer they could start variety gaming if they dip too low or if their viewers are loyal enough they will keep them alive during droughts.

Once you get to 100 the quest grind becomes more enjoyable. I really liked the quests in legion and BfA. Particularly the Alliance quests in BfA I thought were much more exciting than the Horde ones.

Yeah I would definitely be testing the hell out of the servers if I didn’t have to pay blizzard to test their game and provide them with data. Literally broken logic

Isn’t it better to keep it at Theramore till Phase 5 since you can fly from SW to BB quite fast and effortlessly?

How will having national servers prevent uou from reliving your past experiences ? You've completely missed the point.
---
Blizz said they were testing out different sizes for layers and to give your feedback on what you thought in the stress test feedback thread with your server, the time you were on, what you thought of the population, etc.
---
If you are going to "test" the game - you should probably be active in the Classic forum at the very least.
---
This is the feedback they want.
---
Link to source?
---
blizzard bad upvotes pls
---
layering streamers leeway there I even used the buzzwords that deserves a gold
---
If Blizzard wanted the game to be completely no changes, it would be. In this instance, I think it makes sense for the majority of the player base that will be paying their sub to play it. So, no, it really doesn't seem backwards to say I'm okay with layering because that's the direction that most people seem comfortable with compared to the way it was. You may want a exact replica of vanilla to a T, but that was never going to happen. Even if blizzard changes nothing from 2006, we've all changed significantly in 13 years. Most of us have lives outside the game and other things to do with our time. Why should blizzard gate keep the plurality of players to please the hardcore crowd? That's why I think it's selfish for people to cry out against layering without a realistic solution that fixes both problems. They're taking away from the game and the community for their own self satisfaction so they can go in the mirror, pat themselves on the back, and tell themselves they're a hero because they fought for #nochanges. We want classic because we want an old school mmorpg that was the foundation for a sensation that still is going on today. If you want to spend all your time waiting on mob spawns because you have to compete with 400 other people, that's your prerogative. The majority of players will not.
---
As far as I'm aware the big ones are;
---
Feign death having a slight delay on dropping combat making FD trapping buggy
---
FD not working in BGs
---
Pets going passive after one attack
---
Delays on pet commands
---
Minimum range being 11 yards instead of 8 (conjecture on whether this is a bug)
---
Melee leeway allowing enemies to hit you from very far away when kiting (conjecture on whether this existed in vanilla) 
---
I feel like the bugs will probably be fixed but if the game launches with an 11 yard minimum range plus melee leeway I probably will pick another class. I can see this happening since it's not clear if this was a part of vanilla or not, someone posted a video yesterday demonstrating a 3 yard sphere around players implying it might be intentional / true to classic. I play primarily for world pvp so getting crippling poisoned or hamstrung from way outside what feels like melee range sounds like it will make me rage. Plus I'm not that good which will make it even worse hahaha
---
Same thing happens on certain pservers
---
There's a really simple solution - simply make the Alliance on these servers English only, and relegate all the one time enemies of ~~The Empire~~ The Alliance sch as French, Germans and Italians to their true status as the filthy unwashed Horde.
---
See all fixed in 10minutes and we can now go to Stormwind to celebrate with some tea and crumpets!!
---
&gt;Ideal scenario is they monitor it and just turn it off no matter how much time has pased.
---
Yeah, knowing blizz and their track record, I'm sure that's exactly what they'll do. /s
---
lol. bfa? the problem started a decade earlier, but okay, keep sleeping.
---
I find it hard to believe that there wouldn't be some parties that would put 2 and 2 together and be like, "umm why is the playerbase for your game outright rejecting the game you've developed and you've spent hundreds of millions of dollars on?"

The elegance of the Horde cities are that they are a bastion of power. Also, because my cousins' Human Warrior fell through the floor right at the gate to Orgrimmar ages ago, that shit was funny.

You may wanna re-read it my dude. It's his answer to the quest about the demo and judging demand.
---
"With the goal of, once we’re a few weeks in, having all of our realms collapse down to a single cohesive world per realm, no sharding or anything like it. But that will help us manage the early-day player load while still keeping healthy populations in the long run."
---
I will not give a penny.
---
How is this not an example of a problem? Layers are literally keeping you from seeing other players in a capital city in an MMO.
---
I always thought it’d be hilarious if a raid wiped while pulling/fighting him and some rando hits him next and gets kill credit and all loot.

You are literally explaining layering again... It will be only for the start and only for a few weeks
---
Are commands acting as spells perhaps?  .3-.5 seconds, isn’t that about what the spell batch timer is?
---
For a priest? Not as useful as Fear Ward and Desperate Prayer.
---
So what happens if it doesn't get removed? You'll probably still play, and we'll all go on our merry way, end up in guilds together, and shit will be peachy
---
The silence is probably indicative they have found something and they're trying to fix/explain it. There's been constant posts about it for a week or two now so if it was just a 5 min check to verify it's 1.12-like and working as intended they would have just come out and said it.
---
Nope. It started after patch 2.3 when deadzone was being removed from classes starting with the Hunter.
---
Source: I googled the patch notes and you can, too!
---
The hard truth is layering is the best possible choice. They were never gonna do a release with as many crashes and issues as wow launches had in the past. It would've completely fucked the hype to have so many people trying to get on and crashing the servers entirely. Those #nochanges types that can't see past a couple weeks are the most toxic people on here rn.
---
Did you ever land the front side flip?
---
If by phase one you mean all of phase one, then you're wrong.
---
But otherwise it's a good perspective to have
---
Okay, I guess the top classic wow paladin content creators have been wrong this whole time and they're also beyond help.
---
I was horde in tbc when i started and was always DM, honestly only heard VC first within the past year or so.

@13 sec you can see the wf procc resetting the swingtimer and 1 sec later again
---
The only way it could be more real was if the guy asking had "XXxPussyCatPunderxXX" hovering above his head. I swear every time someone makes fun of my name for being from random name generator he's some variant of a hunter called "BowJob"
---
Really wish I would’ve done more than rfc and wc. But given how far our group of 15s got in wc, I’d say maybe the dps isn’t quite right.
---
Yup you're totally right blizz joining together realms to fix population issues with PVP isn't a merger. It's just functionally the same. Just like sharding and layering are functionally the same thing. But go ahead and keep your fingers in your ears, it's totally fine you do you.
---
The #nochanges mob should try to ban streamers.
---
It's funny, I did find a list from 2011 of high-level proc chances, but the info didn't ring true on some numbers. Regardless, the highest procs were those that didn't deal damage (stuff like Silences, Interrupts, Stuns, etc.) so I wouldn't be surprised if the Earthshaker truly did have a proper high proc rate.
---
Nope - after patch 2.3. It never existed while deadzones were in, so pre 2.3.
---
Patch notes are easy to find with Google.
---
It can come in handy in BGs - mainly for hunters who are on defense duty and tricking an enemy into thinking you're not there can easily give you some extra time or play to your advantage. For rogues/druids it obviously doesn't help that much and for priests/warrior going nelf you give up to much and you're rarely going to be on defensive duty anyway.
---
You’re giving the streamers the attention they want.
---
People in your guild are in the same layer.
---
lol, Oceania will get their own server/s.
---
Where did Blizzard say they were going to use phasing? From the beginning they said they would be using layering and they were very open about it. Blizz did not want the weird effects of phasing where leaving zones would phase you out. With layering you will only experience that if you group with somebody in another layer
---
Nope, that's just warm apricot jam. The real lava is further down.
---
Ever seen a streamers twitch chat? Now imagine that in-game everywhere.
---
[Here's the thread we're talking about on the official forums](https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-european-realms-structure/56694)
---
Specifically:
---
&gt; An exception will be made for the Russian language, which will have separate realms due to its reliance on the Cyrillic Alphabet. For technical reasons this will also mean Russian is going to have its own separate game client, similar to what happened in The Burning Crusade.
---
Given what we've been told, I find your argument to be extremely odd.
---
I'm sorry to hear that your one and a half year old daughter has been brainwashed into being a stinky, filthy, horde player.
---
Blizzard really can’t leave this in. They have been doing pretty well listening to player wants but if they go through with this none of that matters.
---
It's good to disappear in a chaotic teamfight if you lose combat. Lets you breathe for a moment and reassess.
---
If you're being chased you can use it quite efficiently if you trick your opponent.
---
There's a lot of sutble uses for it. As a priest you can get off a clean Mind control in strategic locations on the map easily
---
Have you played Splatoon? Its great, an instant classic. The games of your childhood aren't in anyway objectively better or more important than those of your nephew. Honestly you sound like a dick to dismiss a kid's interests just because you don't understand them. What if your uncle did the same to you? Put down your interests as a child to raise those of his own childhood? Its one of the worst things adults do to children casually, refusing to engage them in what they're actually interested in and instead try to force them to somehow relive the childhood of the adult. You can't force your kids to like stuff, and attempting to do so is the fastest way to get them to hate it.
---
It looks like it's fucking up his timer addon is all.
---
Okay I got out of bed and created a youtube channel and made a video. Was not expecting someone to call my bluff -.-  
---
[https://youtu.be/vwT\_45FTtyA](https://youtu.be/vwT_45FTtyA)
---
Thank you? I think lol. Kinda confused, but probably how I worded something or grammatical errors
---
&gt; It's just functionally the same.
---
It's not.  That would be like saying cross realm LFD/LFR means that there are no individual servers.  And you wouldn't say that, because it's retarded.
---
&gt;Just like sharding and layering are functionally the same thing.
---
They're not.
---
&gt;But go ahead and keep your fingers in your ears, it's totally fine you do you.
---
You're the one with the fingers in their ears.  Because Blizzard has explained that they're different.
---
It had to to do with the different stuff they we're testing, like layers.
---
Animal I have become by three days grace. This was my Druid theme :)
---
Above 20... And absolutely non in capital cities. 
---
Imagine walking into the capital city, expecting it to be teeming with activity, but it's a ghost town because of layering. 
---
Layering is bullshit and indefensible in its current form.
---
Of course there's not population balancing between layers, that's *sharding*. That's moving people between shards mid game which hasn't happened at all.
---
BuT tHeY wOnT fIx LaYeRiNg
---
Arent the new starting areas newer than cata? Like mop/wod?
---
Just me
---
Game is definitely a bit too bright for sure. 
---
With that said, I don't really remember nights being all that dark; more of a bit of a tone shift overall along with the night sky.
---
Theres a difference between internal acknowledgment and public admittance.
---
I'm not sure what you were expecting. Its been 15 years since classics story so they had to keep the story moving. External threats get boring and the story for the horde and alliance is actually quite good. It looks like you didn't even give it a chance because it was different.
---
"I don't like people being able to swap layers to farm resources or escape ganks in pvp so they should be allowed to do so easier."
---
We always called it Mines in my Horde group.
---
Idk why it needs to be VC or DM just call it Mines.  Like Scholo or Strat not all instances are acronyms.
---
We shouldn't have two DMs and there's no reason you call an instance after a boss...  Mines.
---
That's a stupid assumption to make considering they could simply have more servers with dynamic respawns (which are infinitely more blizzlike solutions than layering) or drastically limit layering. Waiting for tags is not "not being to play" or gamebreaking whereas layering has to potential to be.
---
Even with that in mind, your opinion on the better solution shouldn't take precedence simply because it would allow more players to be able to play sooner at the sacrifice of the authenticity of classic wow. I wouldn't want blizzard to make classic wow free just because it would allow for more players to be able to play, for example. Or that they should just remove server queues because then it would let more players log in.
---
Absolutely nothing, they respawn after X time and you aren't rewarded anything. City raiding is just hard and fun, and raiding your own cities was extra fun.
---
Global chat will be unreadable at launch whether streaming existed or not. Literally the case during every expansion launch. Imagine getting you're panties twisted up because there's gonna be some twitch emotes among the endless spam.
---
You really need to get out of the pit of denial.  Any random joe can do this lol... 
---
Did you miss the proof that a single person can swap layers without the need for an invite, or did that somehow go right past you?
---
When did they say that?
---
No, you don't lol
---
how is this even a priority?
---
and this is why Retail is what it is
---
Where am i wrong in my understanding of layering
---
&gt; this is new blizzard
---
This is the Classic team, who bothered to do shit like re-implement spell batching. If a company is going to turn around, it's going to happen in stages. The whole thing wont 180 in a day. But keep being a pessimistic pissant I guess?
---
You don't need an invite to swap layers.  You just need one person to help you assign multiple lvl 1 characters to different layers and keep them there.
---
Eating and drinking in stealth is underated imo. Dwarf has a ton of good racials tho
---
Or maybe you can pay attention to where Blizz already said layering is only to deal with the influx of players, will be assessed continually to see when to turn it off, and will 100% be turned off by the start of phase 2 at the latest. 
---
Or just keep bitching about shit that's already been addressed and being an ass to people on the sub who point it out. That's cool too.
---
Except where they already said it would be turned off before Phase 2.
---
It's cute you think most of the autistic ramblings from people about streamers are older gamers.
---
Depends on your play style.  If you're able to stand still and waiting for something to happen and attack from ambush then it's hugely useful.  If you're like me, I'm constantly moving, scanning, looking for targets, baiting targets, etc so it's not so useful.
---
Stealth is always useful, either defending objectives or flag carriers or setting up an ambush, band has great synergy with a rogue or druid, or one of the many nelf hunters. Mind Control out of meld is very good.
---
People will try to sell you on fear ward, but any Horde Warlock knows to re-apply fear on any Dwarf Priest they come across.
---
10,000 people all crammed into 6 starting zones is not the same as 10,000 people evenly dispersed across the world. Population does not have to drop for layering to become obsolete.

You pop as soon as you start the cast so not as nice as it once was in vanilla.

How do morons like you miss the point so easily?  How many alts do you think the average person is going to have for the first half a year of playing vanilla/classic?  It isn't hard to make a lvl 1, test with a single friend to see which layer it is on, then keep that alt on that layer forever.  
---
It is not hard, and people will abuse this if it is possible.
---
Not to mention the economy will right itself after a couple weeks regardless of how much anybody farms. Even if there's a legion of bots farming shit.
---
Yup. As an enhance shaman player. "We didnt have time to visit shamans for the new expac, they will have a rework in 8.1" by 8.2 its "we never promised a rework".

https://www.wowhead.com/news=291722/layering-in-classic-wow
---
not sure what the issue is when on private servers there's a number of different nationality guilds running around spamming their guilds in their own language which will get the attention of those relevant languages/countries.
---
Is it that hard to fathom having to read characters not your own?
---
Sounds like most of you need a can of cement to harden the fuck up.
---
They will just ban the average joe post launch if they are caught I am sure.
---
I hate that fast backwards walk they replaced strafing with.

has absolutely no relevance to anything.

For starters thats why /ignore is a thing
---
secondly nobody forces you to join channels

thirdly HARDEN UP
---
It's so lame
---
it's the only rationale I'll accept because otherwise I have to accept that this sub is full of teenagers which is worse.
---
No kidding.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if an add on could be made that can at least identity a layer a character is on if nothing else.. which would mean the entire exploit would be easily doable with a single person instead of 2 or more to prep.
---
I was able to kill them with a level 12-13 rogue. I was lucky and got a green sword though.

Seems the trap doors are fully functional.

Yet quite a few people white knighting them like no tomorrow.  Exactly what blizzard was counting on.

GODS YOU WERE STRONG THEN BOBBY B
---
&gt; if something is in place on a beta for WoW it is absolutely going to be that way when the game launches.
---
I can't explain these posts
---
YOU LET THAT LITTLE GIRL DISARM YOU?
---
Makes you wonder if anything else like this is slightly broken making everything feel easier and it's not just shit memories.
---
I feel bad for the people worried about streamers. You all are pathetic.
---
Shadowmeld is useful in PvP servers for drinking/eating in relative safety.
---
In PvP in general it has limited niche uses. You can surprise someone with Mind Control and make them jump off a cliff, a boat, or into some lava. Its really fun, but it can get old faster than you'd think.
---
Shadowmeld also allows classes to defend the flag room a bit better in WSG. A Warrior charging at you from Shadowmeld is pretty shocking.
---
In regards to Night Elf Priest specifically, it is literally the worst Priest race choice in the game, bar none. You essentially have no Priest racial spells, and your actual racials don't help you in any meaningful way. Its one of the most underplayed Race/Class combinations, despite Night Elves being an incredibly popular race and that is for a reason.
---
Any other choice is better in terms of value. That said, if your heart is set on Night Elf just do it. Yes its worse in every measurable value, but who cares if its fun for you.
---
Bad enough you've willingly exposed your kid to toxic shits in fortnite but your'e more than happy to introduce it to addictive game mechanics /facepalm
---
Blizzard never lies! They didn't already move the goalposts with layering! How dare you insinuate that my favorite company is a greedy corporation who's only true concern is profit!
---
You know there is an entire generation of morons between boomers and teenagers.
---
Gear is the same, each type needs a debuff slot though and fire mages will do more if everyone is fire for ignite so generally everyone stays the same. Everyone frost for MC/BWL, everyone fire for AQ+.

you are whining about nothing.   Something that won't happen.
---
I think there's people on this board who think that the beta reflects how the game will play at launch.
---
Shadowmeld is useful, but fearward is just insane together with stone form to remove poisons (including blind), bleeds, and Disease is just broken. 
---
I would find an argument for Warrior and hunter, but priest is just not that strong as the alternative.
---
create guilds for said languages/countries
---
create channels for said languages/countries
---
open can of cement and drink - hardening the fuck up.
---
Because y'all would be bitching about all the server migrations the same way y'all are bitching about layering. It's a messy process and people hate it. It's no better of a solution than temporary layering, because the reality is they cant predict how many people will start and how many people will make it past week1, 2, etc. Layering isn't a bad system all things considered.
---
"first few weeks"
---
They've said it could last through phase 2.
---
It's a bigger problem than you're suggesting.
---
Attacks are nomalized based on weapon types so that Slow weapons speeds aren't incredibly overpowered.
---
In vanilla 2H's were 3.4 speed in Ability Damage Calculations, and in Legion and therefore the beta, it was based on 3.6 speed.
---
Same with other weapon types, which meant abilities like MS, SS, Backstab, etc. were doing 5-10% more damage then they should on Beta. But the Blue post says it's being fixed already.
---
I hope warriors are the most popular by a landslide, so that I can have more people in support of bashing every other class in the game. 
---
Warriors are the best.  Better players play warriors.  Warriors have to overcome the greatest hardships.  Warriors are typically the leaders.  Warriors sign your paycheck.  All hail warriors, the true overlords.
---
Large amount of ships in one space, they literally redice the speed the game plays at. Not great.
---
Shadowmeld is decent but compared to Stoneform it’s hot garbage. Being able to Stoneform things like blind, crippling, and viper sting is a godsend.
---
This sub would shift to complaining about server merges on a dime.  Ruins the game, I've been told.
---
Don't bother. None of these types can figure out the difference between sharding, layering, and phasing.
---
Agreed! I'd love TBC. Heck I've been playing on a TBC pserver while I wait for Classic.
---
Ah fuck. Been a while. The harbor isn't in SW.
---
I WISH I could play on a non-English server now. Great way to practice other languages.
---
He did not. Ion said many times numbers can be hotfixes, but major class redesigns were going to have to wait for major content patches.
---
I wonder how many more instances of complete and utter abuse need to be shown to get everyone off the white knight crusade already.
---
This is actually the reason why I mostly just use keybinds, now I use a game pad so I have 16 buttons plus a shift key, an alt key, and a Ctrl key, and the 8 buttons on my mouse. I make the decision to have slightly more clutter onscreen however I see every cool down independently (also I main lock so I have lots of buttons)
---
You can't quite do that for a variety of reasons, but you can include "/startattack" at the front of all your normal combat skills. Each time you press an attack, it will also try to turn on autoattack. This will all but guarantee you continuously attack your target. 
---
It seems like you keep your autoattack on your action bar. You should remove it since you can just drop your current target to turn it off, or right click them to turn it on. It mostly just wastes valuable hotkeys.
---
Don't forget about economy.
---
"No one will play classic."  
---
A lot of people in my guild said this for months and months.  
---
Haw Haw.
---
They did not say that.  If you want to carry on this nonsense show me where they said that.
---
Horde cities usually have a decent amount of people in them
---
The biggest example of leeway is deadzone kiting warriors as a rogue. This was very easy to do in vanilla and the meta way of duelling warriors. It's now completely impossible in the beta client. It is clearly not the same implementation. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoR1BDlqRMI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=165   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNhkT66TqDo&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=246
---
Hard to see, it may just be affecting the addon and not the actual internal swing.
---
Its a trick, Troll warriors are best racial wise PVE in the first place
---
Classic forums are filled with the biggest babies known to man.
---
glad theres ZERO streamers in OCE.
---
Inb4 phase 2 is 4 months after launch
---
Imagine caring so much about someone who has never thought about you
---
You're very welcome. Let me know if you run into character limit problems, as stance dancing tends to do. I can help you condense or split your macros.
---
Yea, which is completely stupid.  
---
It is also indicative of a possibility that they could require people to go to cities to swap layers, which would be such a frickin timesink in vanilla to the point of insanity.
---
I agree. But I want to play a Horde Paladin and I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm struggling with what to play now.
---
I would think orcs cooldown would lead to more DPS?
---
Private servers (even "Blizzlike" ones) have also had non vanilla cash shop items for years. I would take lauerong for 2 weeks over purchasable 28 slot bags anyday
---
He literally says few weeks and not a couple, if you are new to Blizzard yhey would never in a million years say something as concrete as "a couple of weeks" unless they are officially giving a release date. The official statement is a few weeks but definitely before phase 2. The problem with this is
---
1) a few weeks can be 6 or more weeks, (depending on their definition of weasel word "few"), it could literally be months
---
2) Blizzard lies. A lot.
---
Same and the dwarf vs human choice is killing me
---
I think it is possible that it wont be quite as bad, but I am sure layer hopping exploits will still be present.
---
you mean when people actually communicate
---
It was like this in vanilla, I distinctly remember it
---
Two. Millennials and gen x.
---
Straight up they need to trash phasing/layering. Just throw that shit in the trash.
---
I lived on the island of Mallorca Spain for a number of years, could hardly watch Netflix
---
Which is completely opposed to the original design philosophy of vanilla.
---
It is just the addon. I went frame by frame.
---
He swings regularly, gets a WF proc with 2.08 seconds on the timer, the timer resets, then he swings again with 1.72 seconds left on the timer. That's a 3.4 second swing time. Without combat logs I can't really be sure what's giving him the 0.2 seconds of haste, but the WF proc definitely did not reset the timer.
---
I'm already preparing for this by learning a bunch European languages.
---
Because Character in Classic IS a big time investment and inability to change races with $$, the initial race/class selection is even more important. Imagine picking a human mage or warlock only to later find out gnomes are just flat out better at both.
---
You really think they wont be capable of working this out?
---
What was the result?
---
The obvious plan of action would be to go full shit bucket, and IV leveling mode. Use your now higher level character than your whelping friends to corpse camp them until they get right with God and reroll horde.
---
Six demon bag, it has a chance to do a few things; one of them being a direct damage ability.  It has 6 abilities.

Polymorph:Sheep  
---
Whirlwind  
---
Felhunter
---
Well you can't beat those dance moves on a human male ;-)
---
God I missed this comic
---
If the game only grows, then layering cannot be dropped.
---
If people actually applied even a tiny bit of a logic to this situation then they should easily come to the same conclusion.  You can't have 3+ layers worth of max server pop converge into each other without also adding 3x the servers and then expecting so many people to take a transfer to a new server.
---
Seems like Classic might be a little more balanced than the elites would have us believed.
---
I haven't messed with macros for years, and play pservers on a stock UI because I'm lazy.  I will definitely have to get back into it and get my stance dance on!
---
Aw that's sick, glad to see you there!
---
Cool, thanks! Not a mage question but you seem to only what is up. Are locks a pain to find a spot with for casual/ semi-hardcore raiding? Are they really significantly worse to level than mages?
---
This is a common comment format. "Imagine &lt;doing a thing&gt;" is a way of expressing disdain for the person who is doing the thing. The implication is "Imagine how stupid/careless/ignorant/etc. you would have to be to do that."
---
Thank you!
---
Considering I'm the author of the Anti-Streamer Blacklist addon that he's talked about on stream several times and definitely contributed to his decision not to stream, yeah, he's thought about me.
---
This is THE best reaction video. Thank you for this!
---
Shaman? It's so good. I was going to play a Paladin too but I've been Horde since I came back to retail and these were the Horde glory days. I was having a blast on my shaman in the stress test.
---
the 25% to BASE melee AP? The axes specialization is much bigger DPS boost.
---
What am I looking at.
---
Did blizzard have the best idea with WoW in the second half of wrath, in cata, in pandaria or beyond?
---
Was blizzard right about buff homogenization, LFD/LFR and cross server phasing/sharding?  
---
I agree with you one something though.  Activision Blizzard did do a number crunch, and it was to reduce the amount of total servers they need to physically run and maintain by creating a system that diminishes gameplay beyond the first few days of launch.
---
If layering is this atrocious I’ll probably just go the TBC pserver lol
---
If you prefer the way humans look then definitely pick a human. You spend all that effort getting full raid gear, then realize you are a 2 feet tall and can barely even see the gear. Maybe you like being small.
---
Mind adding me to that list?
---
They can also only layer non-contested zones. That plus option one would be ideal, especially if they turn it off after 2 weeks once the initial wave calms down
---
Sure but you can get it started when they have no idea you are around.  You just hang out at some point of interest in the world and wait.
---
Avoidstreamers.com
---
Paladin? 
---
Humans have perception (situational) and weapon specialization only really important in PVE melee DPS, so a must if your Guild lets you Ret DPS.
---
Dwarfs have Stoneform ...... immune to bleeds and poisons ..... 
---
So PVP Dwarf, PVE Human.
---
Should’ve been a void elf on the right and a human male in middle
---
&gt; Play the Race that you want to Play
---
Ok. I pick the one with the best racials for PvP.
---
I hate it &gt;:c
---
These stress tests are just getting me addicted to the game again and then taking it away from me!
---
But your "emotional investment" only matters for your own wellbeing/morale.
---
A coder cannot go to the director and tell him "this new skill you had me code is stupid and unbalanced, I'm not doing it"
---
So is this just printed on canvas?  What size did you do and where can I get it done so it looks that good
---
problem is, there is no fix to layering/sharding/phasing. its a concept that just doesn't work with mmo's, retail is the best example.
---
Agreed. And Tauren is a master race. I wish they could be rogues.
---
Yes, I'm thinking so. I think I have finally decided what I'm going to play. Thank you for your comment! :-)  One quick question... which spec to start with?
---
I was going to upvote this until I saw the lok tar at the end....I will never support you horde scum!  
---
(Jk take this upvote and cheers for the positivity bud)
---
Yep a day after layering was announced I asked whether anyone else was worried about the potential abuse, aka layer hopping. My thread got like two downvotes and few comments saying its not sharding and it'll be ok no need to panic.
---
its hard for me to say since im not in the beta so i cant test it but im also getting reports that sword specc is resetting swing timers. also that video is nearly a month old and wf was changed a few times since then. at the point it is right now it was tested by a friend of me and atm it is resetting your swings
---
Complaining about downloading, thats a downvote.
---
Apparently. People who are world record holding speed runners are about 5 days play time. That's after countless runs and practice. 
---
Even with a leveling guide, I'm not expecting to hit level 60 any sooner than 7 days played, because I want to hit all the dungeons leveling up. But I wouldn't be surprised if I'm more than that.
---
I might be taking the first week off work, but even playing 16 hours a day (not likely, but a maximum for me) I'll only have 4 days 16 hours played by Monday evening (labor day). That next week, Im back to work, so I might only get 6 hours a day in tuesday-friday. Then 16 Saturday/Sunday.
---
So, by the end of week 2, a best case scenario for me, I'll be at exactly 7 days of play time.  I might just barely get 60 Sunday night.  Maybe... That's also assuming Indo nothing but eat, sleep, play WoW and work one week of work. If it does take me 5 days played, I'll hit 60 a week after release.
---
For most normal people putting in 6-8 hours a day, you're looking at 2 weeks if they do 5 days played to 60.  If they're 7 days to 60, that's three weeks to 60. And that's just straight leveling, no exploring, no "having the vanilla experience" by any means.
---
Even the most avid poopsockers won't get 60 until a week to a week and a half. Having only a few days of layer exploiting if it does end in 2 weeks.
---
Then post combat logs. But so far your evidence has proven the opposite.
---
Who the actual fuck thinks 90% of the players are gonna drop out two weeks in. You gotta be a special kinda stupid.
---
&gt; since im not in the beta
---
how
---
I romanticize anarchy as much as the next person, but at this scale it will only lead to either 'layering' in the form of user filters creating a confusing browsing experience, or new subs popping up that will attract the pro-rules(the majority) audience.
---
What is the plausible narrative you're suggesting could have happened here? That Blizzard would refuse to publicly admit to a bug's existence *to save face* despite clear-cut evidence and community complaints?  
---
"Damn, the community proved that this bug exists. Better not say anything otherwise we'd admit to our incompetence!"  
---
Does that anime-villain level of arrogance seem in any way plausible to anyone?
---
If you are torn about, don't.
---
And when you get banned for exploiting are you gonna QQ on this sub?
---
Humans are way better Paladins dude. All of their racials benefit Paladins in some way.
---
Dwarves? Find Treasure is useless, Stoneform is largely obsoleted by Purify, and Paladins can't even use ranged weapons(gun spec) at all.
---
That is cataclysm. Garrosh goes bad in MoP, the Forsaken were bad at the time of the zone revamp.
---
Corporate cost cutting at every turn is what we are seeing. 
---
History has shown that rough launches don't negatively affect the lifespan of an mmorpg if the game is good and worth playing; this is also in part because people already put down a sub fee (or game purchase) and would be unlikely to quit without waiting for things to settle anyway. 
---
More layers means less servers.  Less servers means less maintenance required by actual employees as well as fewer costs associated with running them to begin with.  
---
Look at loot trading and right click reporting+automated punishment.  Both reek of the desire to hire less GMs. 
---
There is nothing tinfoil about this.  Corporations don't exist to make us happy.  They exist to make as much money as possible while spending as little as they can get away with.  This is why Activision Blizzard canned 800~ people this year; they dropped costs in order to have the quarterly report show a net positive gain to their shareholders, who in turn keep investing in the company.
---
For leveling, enhance all the way. It depends on how you want to play the game. You'll see a lot of talk about specific builds being best but those are usually for a specific leveling trick or strategy. If you're like me and like to think of your guy from an RP sort of perspective, just go with your gut.
---
The RPG part requires a fair bit of brainwork but I love when games have homework, Crunching the numbers and testing things. So I think I know enough to kind of chart my own course and I plan to roll with the punches and do my best to make my character work the way I want.
---
Definitely look at some videos on YouTube for Classic Shaman to get a better idea.
---
Of course they were. They are zone dependant, but they are server wide. If you're in a capital, you see every message anyone posts on trade chat. If you're in Mulgore, you see every message people post in general chat.
---
I feel like you and some other people need to shut the fuck up and stop screeching about everything, especially when you're so dumb you don't understand really easy, basic shit.
---
Not sure if they'll be in at launch, but there were cloth turn-in's for faction reputation gains.
---
But I like Asmongold. His streams are always interesting and I’ve been watching for almost 3 years now.
---
Maybe I'm understanding this wrong, if Instant Attacks were weapon speed normalized to 3.6 and now gets changed to 3.3, there's no way you could *gain* dps by that, regardless of the speed of your current weapon?
---
Seems like most of this subreddit thinks so. 
---
Not sure why OSRS history or actual vanilla history isn't being taken into account as examples, but in both examples the games in 2 years both gained FAR more than they lost.  That was before OSRS had content voting too.
---
This is not about stream sniping, this is normal pvp life that now gets ruined by a immersion breaking system, that also acts as a safe space for retail babies.
---
"Only people who agree with me have a brain" is such an asinine way to think about the world
---
Then how did you test it? None of the stress tests have been high enough to get Windfury or any of the extra swing talents or items.
---
More like TwitchBobbyB
---
Layering won't solve that.
---
Because in a game where pulling two mobs is trouble and pulling three mobs is death, having faster respawns is really really bad.
---
It's the constant to deal 1 damage per second.
---
Honestly I wasn't sure about your plan, but this really sealed the deal for me. I'm 100% on board.
---
They can't have current layering work in a way that doesn't apply to the entire world, that much was clear with the stress test.  
---
For that to be a reality, it would essentially just be a form of sharding mixed with layering, and I don't see that happening.
---
Post wasn’t meant to be taken to seriously. Was just having some fun talking about my experience and the fact that it was harder than I thought. Also I haven’t played a lot of Vanilla Warrior so I was learning along the way and I’m sure I goofed or played wrong multiple times.
---
They'll probably level better than mages unless the mage in question can somehow edge ahead of the launch pack and get some AOE grinding spots all to themselves (unlikely).
---
Locks are always needed, they have utility not found elsewhere, but their damage apparently scales a lot more with gear (and especially they lack hit% at the start of p1).
---
There's really no *class* that wont be taken to raids at any level, but there are *specs* that won't see daylight.  You'll just have to do research on what you want to play.
---
Shouldn't have any troubles finding a raid spot, particularly on alliance. Warlocks are usually said to be easier to level than mages if anything, they can't aoe grind but they have low downtime with pet and dots which some people think is fun (people often complain that you have to drink a lot on mage). Probably the main difference is lock tends to feel a bit sadder in 5 mans. Summoning people is awesome, but actual combat utility is lacking. Utility like poly/nova/blizzard and good instants like CoC/fireblast /arcane explosion make mages the best 5 man dps. And of course as a warlock you get to experience the joy of a super slow run when your healer runs out of water.
---
/bow
---
I'm only playing classic to kill soda ;)
---
Then why do the anti layering people keep asking for 10k+ servers? That's a pserver thing, and I would say it's a bigger change than layering if they keep layers at the same population levels as servers were back then
---
I wish you were right.
---
Wait, if instant attacks are normalized, why is everyone still going for the slow hard hitting weapons?
---
What do people even mean by "normalized" at this point?
---
It's funny how this system was supposed to make the game more accessible but instead seems to sow endless confusion. I fucking hate this normalization shit.
---
racials are stupidly powerful in vanilla wow.
---
Moat people on this sub don't think for themselves. They rely on others opinions to find a way to latch onto the hate train
---
I wish you luck.
---
Thanks so much TLR! I will definitely check some videos out. If you'd like, add me on BT. Synsational#1300. I don't play as much as I used to since my son started college and I got a 2nd job but WoW is my "thing I look forward to getting home to" now lol. Thanks again!
---
A fresh private server comes out in 14 hours. Just play that.
---
You could play WoW on 1Mbps.
---
People vastly overestimate how much data online games require
---
go tank instead
---
What exactly do you want them to do? Buy millions of dollars of more servers that won't get used after the first few weeks of launch? Not trying to hate just unsure of what exactly is the sollution here?
---
Woooooo great wow experience
---
 I am sure this did happen in vanilla.  Duelers were not always clearly visible  from the gates.  Everyone else saying anything different is lying and  trying to shit talking layering.
---
that's me in the bottom right! nice screen shot ^^ thank you I'm gonna save this.
---
Still says Dreamweaver
---
I don't care if you make this decision based on cosmetics, but don't expect to be competitive if you do. You will lose fights because of your choice and there will be some guilds and premades that choose a player with the advantageous race over your cosmetic choice.
---
Yes, Social Services its this post right here.
---
Such an alliance thing to do....that is all,sewing some preliminary discord.
---
It's all passion baby
---
I mean, truth be don't I don't know how long phases will be. If they have layering for the whole of phase 1, and say that phase 1 happens to be 5 months, I'm not sure it'd be good
---
Haha well I really wanted to run enh shammy but will hold off on that thought. Thanks for the thelp
---
Too many people think people from neighboring countries actually like each other... oh how wrong they are.
---
All the q&amp;a's are NA time, all the beta testing is NA time, server resets are NA time everything in this game is NA time and for once it would be cool if they atleast cared a bit.
---
Get the fuck out of here with your full words
---
Layering will ruin it tho
---
This is so accurate for every big corporation it's scary
---
Then why are you here?  /r/wowservers is that way brother.
---
Probably roll mage then, thanks again for the help!
---
They've been so anal about everything.  It is so painfully obvious that I can't believe people would actually defend it.
---
Imagine how far up your own ass you have to be you sincerely, without a fucking hint of irony, think you speak for 99% of wow fans. Geez loweez, fuck off with that nonsense
---
Level 3 was for sure different from 15, i leveled on both and I barely saw people outside of the first few hours on 3. On 15 there weren’t many people but at least you’d see some people. On 3 I legit sat in goldshire for maybe 30 minutes and saw less than 10 people.
---
scare tactics
---
Is the joke that PVP isnt part of WoW?
---
You're correct.
---
That's true. If phases are flexible and people are farming MC by the end of month 1,I think we'll be seeing phase 2 around the 2 month mark. But layering isn't necessarily tied to phases anyways, so even if phase 2 takes longer, they can turn off layering whenever
---
Im not saying you have too. I feel people need to know what they are getting into long term. How much would it suck if you spent 200+ hours to realise the top end content you want to do in the way you want to experience it is not viable because of the choices you made at character select.
---
Truth hurts.

It’s a great list !

---
I read that last sentence as: you just hang out at the great lift and wait.
---
Do you even listen to yourself?  
---
If people can't frickin understand each other in classic, then good luck forming groups and coordinating.  
---
Your issue is that you live in fairy land where every nation's people loves everyone who neighbors them in another country.  That isn't reality and it never has been, and likely never will be to be frank.
---
Way to pick at the least important detail in my post.
---
Nope. Layering needs to be in at launch, and I'll continue to defend it. The pros outweigh the cons.
---
I was thinking the pop just died after the first few hours but now I’m thinking everyone just got their own personal layer.
---
I’m leaning more toward Paladin right now, originally I was thinking stoneform is the selling point but without arenas I’m realizing it means less to me
---
Alright, sounds good. I only have 1 child and she's 2 so my days can be chaos sometimes. Definitely gonna try to get some free time when classic launches though! I'll add you for sure, I play Horde on Mal'Ganis, been leveling a Mag'har Orc Shaman after my fun in classic with the shaman.

Even if he was incompetent as a Game Director, his reaction on Blizzcon when someone suggested that Classic is not the real game (and the way he talks about Classic) clearly shows he likes Vanilla. To suggest he is some evil, bitter person who wants to destroy Classic because some people like it more than modern WoW is simply detached from reality.
---
might as well kill some time till tbc classic coms out.  supporting this mess also increases the chance of tbc classic getting made.
---
Why wouldn't you be able to switch layers via character swap?
---
If they want to system to appear seamless, then you need to remain on the layer you were last on.  If not, then it might as well just be a jumbled mess of sharding. 
---
This is an exploit that is a byproduct of the system and cannot be removed without arbitrarily requiring people to go to a hub to switch or something... which is another can of worms altogether.
---
Ooga booga, bfa bad, classic good!
---
&gt; Wait, if instant attacks are normalized, why is everyone still going for the slow hard hitting weapons?
---
Because they are still best when paired with abilities that instantly deal your weapon damage (mortal strike, backstab, sinister strike, etc). You essentially get a "free" weapon swing with instant attacks so you want the highest damage possible (which generally means the slowest speed).
---
Speeds being normalized was just a nerf to the really slow weapons, basically.
---
Anyone else ever thought it weird that Shamans get by far the best shield talent in the game?
---
Paladins: Shield block bonus, but *only after being hit with a crit*, and 30% increased damage blocked, for 8 points
---
Warriors: 5% block, 100% to generate one rage when blocking, and one-point-wonder that is for some reason three point talent = 6 points
---
Shamans: 5% block AND 25% more damage blocked for 5 points.
---
There's been a [ton of research](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?issue=10394&amp;highlight=windfury#comments:0) done on this issue by private servers already.
---
There's video analysis of videos that were recorded after 1.4 and in which Windfury does reset the swing timers. Patch notes aren't always the truth, especially when there was very clearly an undocumented change that made WF and extra attack procs reset the swing timer in a patch after 1.4.
---
TL;DR there's multiple video evidence of Windfury resetting the swing timer in post-AQ patches, 1.4 patch notes aren't relevant.
---
I had thought that but you could see people in chat still, and using /who Elwynn showed 50 which is the max it shows so I’m there were tons of people still on and you’d have to see them since you’re effectively confined to a few zones. SW was also completely dead despite trade chat always active
---
Interesting, good to know!
---
Credit for art assets goes to [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/)
---
Yet people are phasing out at city gates and have been for almost a month now.
---
I'm in its my purpose for playing. I'll roll any server he's on hit me up. Soda tears will fuel my wow machine.
---
They have literally never said that.
---
I was a part of it too, that was honestly one of my best wow experiences. No matter what the haters say, i highly doubt they would’ve done that if asmongold wasn’t there. so i have him to thank and the rest of the community too. thank you everyone ❤️
---
I dislike layering just as much as the other guy, but sometimes i dream about blizzard removing it and letting players wait in login que for 6h fuck you idiots this is what you wanted
---
Ya I leveled my shaman up with the assumption 8.1 would make big changes. When 8.1 hit, they ignored Enhance, and basically just buffed bad talents on ele, which made them competitive dps-wise but still the worst feeling dps caster in the game, bar none. Retail team half-assed this expansion so hard
---
how? 
---
i thought in order to get discounts, you need at least  **Honored**
---
Stop being silly. 
---
We will have oceanic server's 
---
We will have 1 normie 1 pvp minimum. 
---
They wont dog the boys like that. 
---
Separation by language is not the same as having a server located in your country or close enough to get sub 150ms. 
---
Thats all we care about.
---
Didn't realize it was base AP only. That's a bummer.
---
They actually specifically said the complete opposite, multiple lead devs in multiple interviews INCLUDING the blizzcon q&amp;a stated that vanilla wow coding is so lightweight and the  calculation of the spells and abilities takes so little resources that modern day servers can easily handle massive amounts of players in one building.
---
They specifically stated that layering is a solution for gameplay issues (mob tagging) and not technical issues.
---
Wrong weaponskill does way more in classic then on p-server. [https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/issues/5](https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/issues/5) here for numbers but short said  remove the \~2-3 crit protection of bosse give you \~1hit some even say 2 hit. With that Weapon spec of human and orc is way more OP. Btw there is still a min glancing of 5% that can never be denied what can be on p-server.
---
The arrogance and idiocy is thick. Getting this salty over something that will be removed in a few weeks, does good for the whole server, AND having the arroagance to pretend that it's for the greater good? That's a whole new level of dumb. Have it it bro, I'm not going to argue with a moron.
---
No. Layering is much better because you're in 100% control if you ever change phases. Sharding means it's 100% not in your control, which is fucking terrible.
---
That was fast
---
Even though this was uploaded in 480p, it still brought me a feeling of happiness. 
---
Thank you.
---
Welcome to corporate life.  If anyone here thinks a corporation gives a flying crap about any of us, then you are sadly mistaken.  
---
Classic is a project much like every other game Activision Blizzard produces.  They cost cut as much as possible; remember this year's 800 employee lay off?  
---
If layering wasn't enough of an indication that they want to run as few servers as possible despite the extreme controversy, then I don't know what to say anymore.
---
Depends on the country, but spanish, italian and french people especially are very bad at it.
---
I suppose I should have specified Prot over Fury. Berserking is tops for threat generation.
---
Well, I still see people confused about shadow meld, since it can't be used in combat in classic, it's handy with feign death, though.
---
Kill a mob, get invited. If a new mob appeared in place of the dead one, you are in a new layer.
---
I don't think it's that weird, there's a lot of other things in their kit/talents that make it seem like Blizz probably intended them to be able to tank at one point in development.  Numbers just didn't pan out and they let it fade away as they updated the class (sadly).
---
What's the solution then? besides everyone learning everyone elses language?
---
Fixed
---
Hoe come people say this is how vanilla worked? This technology didn't even exist back then.
---
This is layering/sharding. And no its not lagg or view distance because he coudnt even see the dwarf that spawned BEHIND after he moved 5 steps forward.
---
And that guy that tried to gank you that your force-layered away from? Was he 100% in control?
---
The problem with layering is that if there's 4 server layers, there's 4 layers of high-level zones that people can abuse to farm 4x the materials.
---
If they do sharding BY ZONE, and turn it off for everything 30+, then there IS no sharding/phasing once you approach higher levels, and the server is still stable while thousands still go through the starter zones.
---
Your boys make up less than 4% of the total Western playerbase. I'm not sure Blizzard even gives much thought to you.
---
Layering and streamers. Fuck em both.
---
The only world where troll beats axe specialization is if you happened to be one of the very few people wielding thunderfury, and if you're wielding thunderfury you don't need someone to tell you what racials are good.
---
the second option? What is so bad about mergers? when they are done agressively who fucking cares? You still keep playing with the same people, juts + a bunch more. It is by far the best option and the fact people are against it drives me crazy?
---
Seriously, what is the downside to merging servers? I just don;t see it.
---
I started taking CBD just 1 month ago, and I found out about WoW classic’s re-release 2 days ago. 
---
So, needless to say, this post made me smile. 😃
---
Yeah on retail it doesn't matter with sharding and cross server functionalities, but on classic if you end up on the french realm for exemple and nobody speaks english, your experience will probably be awful.
---
Who are you quoting?
---
I doubt peoples reasoning for disliking Soda is his skill in the game.
---
Streamers will be treated like royalty on any server they play on. As much as he wants the "classic experience" he's going to be fed loot and gold.  If all the streamers roll on one server then they will probably dictate how the server runs.
---
(I'm not salty at streamers I'm just taking a guess)
---
I’m pretty sure people go for slow weapons even with normalization because a slow weapon will still have a higher damage range compared to a fast one. For example, weapon A with speed 3.6 will have a damage range of 400-600 and weapon B with a speed of 3.0 will have a damage range of 300-500.  Just made up numbers of course, but you get the idea.
---
Maybe in OG, since there is a “tunnel”
---
Much better then any Asmongold content Ive seen. I didnt have a headache after watching it. Thankyou
---
&gt; Because they are still best when paired with abilities that instantly deal your weapon damage (mortal strike, backstab, sinister strike, etc).
---
Except these are normalized too, this is what the thread is about.
---
The princess was in another castle?
---
His head looks put on backwards
---
Vanilla dungeons were never hard. Anyone who believes they were hard is confusing having shit group mates who would over pull as the dungeon being hard. There was a reason people so fondly remember TBC Heroics because those dungeons actually were hard on a standard pull. Crowd control in vanilla was only required when someone fucked up.
---
If you want to simulate the nostalgia goggle "hard" vanilla dungeons then have 3/5 of your party members with bad specs and random gear, have a hunter that pulls extra packs every pull, and a mage that sits so far back to drink they pull patrols you forgot to kill.
---
You can't possibly be this stupid.
---
Stream sniping = their own self-inflicted problem. irrelevant to this
---
Switching layers = it's about the effect on the entire population, not just the one streamer
---
Layering isn't about cutting costs though. It requires an equal amount of resources to run multiple Layers as it does multiple realms, if not more because of the overhead for swapping players around. Certainly more in development and testing time and resources.
---
And not giving Germany or Australia their own servers isn't about cutting costs either. They're still completely supporting the German language and will still need realms for Australia to play on. If anything, they'll lose players because of it.
---
The decision is completely based off of what Blizzard thinks they need to ensure every Classic realm is a success.
---
I love in every one of these examples there's never anyone else in any of the other layers you swap to, lmao.
---
Apparently you're the only person in the area and when you change layers it's guaranteed to be completely empty and you won't be swapping into a situation that's way worse and there definitely isn't going to be anybody farming there.
---
Get over it. Sharding isn't happening, layering is. It will probably be tweaked a little more before live, but you're not going to be changing anything.
---
Considering I'm talking about Prot spec then TF is likely. TF with +30% attack speed sells it even further.
---
10 mbps is not horrible internet lol...
---
Go with DSL as it is very stable.  Satellite will always drop during bad weather and is heavily impacted by a neighbor also on the same plan. 
---
Keep in mind that 10mbps will let you stream just about anything reasonable quickly, and most people in early WoW probably were hovering at around 2-3 mbps and did just fine.   5 was a luxury for a long time.
---
Happened to me once on my Shaman... I just logged off in place and jumped on my other toon.  When I eventually logged back over, the area was empty and I completed no problem.  Most of the time, though... people recognized that grouping up was the best solution.
---
He’s your president 🤡🌎
---
Easy to test. Go back in the city and come back. 
---
If people are the same there is no layering.
---
Yes.. they are normalized - do you know what that means?
---
It was!  I ran into people several times and I could feel a sense of community building within 48 hrs.  Classic is such a great experience.
---
lurking here made it obvious everyone already was against layering
---
Aggressive free server mergers, no fee because it is extremely simple to do. It solves all the problems and has no downside.
---
I did several times, always the same people
---
Yeah man, these idiots don’t know it’s just so easy to “look at the code”.  I mean for Christ’s sake, blizzard just look at the code! It’ll tell you everything, with one simple glance they could catch every minor thing by just looking at the damn code!
---
Again, the only world where troll beats it is **specifically** with thunderfury, and if you're one of the people that's getting thunderfury you already know what racials are good.
---
I want to play dwarf priest so I can get that ginvite over your night elf priest.  Sorry, but this is how it is going to be in a lot of serious raiding guilds that actually progress.  
---
Also, orc warrior DPS &gt; other races by a landslide.
---
did anyone ever think that since there is a low amount of people playing the beta, and that they want to test the layering that it'll actually be what they said before being 1-10ish to flesh out leveling then? I bet you don't.
---
Sentient
---
stfu
---
As i said before. 
---
Blizz will hook there aussie friends up.
---
OH MY GOD STUPID SERVER MERGE STOLE MY GUILD NAME
---
&gt; Why wouldn't you be able to switch layers via character swap? 
---
Because there is no reason you need to.
---
&gt; If they want to system to appear seamless, then you need to remain on the layer you were last on. If not, then it might as well just be a jumbled mess of sharding. 
---
Exactly my point on why this is a bug...
---
&gt; This is an exploit that is a byproduct of the system and cannot be removed without arbitrarily requiring people to go to a hub to switch or something... which is another can of worms altogether. 
---
Character A is on layer X
---
Character B is on layer Y
---
Logging on or off shouldn't change your layer.
---
I dont know what race to play as a rogue since I enjoy world pvp it stands between gnome and dwarf.... I really want both escape artist and stoneform but I lean against dwarf but the shame I know many horde players feel when they get their asses handed to them by a gnome may be worth playing it.
---
Yeah that was one of my favorites also.
---
Layering is much worse that Sharding for Classic. You cannot have single-instance zones for higher levels with layering. Blizzard CAN do that by Sharding early zerg-infested zones and everything 30+ be a singular server, single zones.
---
BOTH systems would be turned off in a few weeks, but every server's economy will get fucked over by layer-hopping resource farmers that speedleveled ahead of the zerg.
---
The game was stitched together back then. They hid the seams really well but sometimes you would see this happen, even in vanilla
---
/counter-cringe
---
Locking servers to one language and country.
---
I was a casual player when I started in BC, and eventually made it to 70.  Mostly did PvP during BC.  Then during Wrath I got pretty serious into raiding.  This game will accommodate casuals quite well, and it does a good job of converting people into serious players.
---
Really want to be known as a great WSG Druid flag carry. Trying to learn everything I can. Hoping to push high ranks of pvp.
---
It depends on your point of view.  You can easily count the times Fear Ward absorbs a fear for you, but you can never quantify how many times you didn't have to run back from the graveyard because you were drinking in Shadowmeld.
---
It's BY FAR the best race for casuals.  Wisp form and AFK Shadowmeld are god tier time savers for people who get interrupted while playing.
---
That’s fucked up.
---
E-Celebs were a thing back in vanilla too. There will always be people who stand out. You cut one down another will rise to the top.
---
So more than a month into the beta and this kind of bug is only being discovered now... With all the theorycrafting that was already done in the first weeks this is surprising. 
---
This proves even more that anyone who thinks the beta is always right is very wrong
---
Agree to disagree. The entire point of the post is that other races are viable and even arguably better.
---
I can only assume anyone who would recommend sharding over literally anything else hasn't played 5 minutes of BfA.
---
Enjoy your layering.
---
Idk about that, if you’re doing 1k dps having a difference of 20 dps could mean a few more lucky crits.  It definitely wouldn’t stand out to me as much as you’re making it seem like it would.
---
it didn't occur to me, no.
---
Thanks dude.
---
A lot of streamers are actually saying that they won't reveal the realm they're on until a few days or weeks after launch. Just shows how inconsiderate they are.
---
&gt;Unintended use of game mechanics
---
Yeah, a unintended use of game mechanics designed to be used. Sounds logic.
---
Many of the basic quests in the world really are designed to be done with groups.  I am an introverted person, so it is not something I seek out.  But, in Classic, I learn to love the experience of banding together to get it done.  Things become significantly easier the more you group.  The grind turns into something fun, and before you know it... you have played six hours and downed RFC, when you had only planned on killing some Zherva in the Barrens.
---
Just thought I’d share this classic vid, it was made 12 years ago, and brings me a feeling of happiness every time I watch it.
---
Enjoy!

heres a link to another dev at the same event saying months, u/NoXousX is full of shit.
---
Im gonna comment in every layering thread i see until. 
---
LAYERING IS NOT GONNA BE A PERMANENT FEATURE. IT'S GOING TO BE USED FOR THE FIRST FEW WEEKS AFTER LAUNCH TO AVOID THE POSSIBILITY OF DEAD SERVERS. IF YOU THINK ANYTHING ALONG THE LINES OF "LAYERING IS GONNA KILL THE CLASSIC EXPERIENCE. OMG LAYERING IS GONNA RUIN THE GAME AND THE SENSE OF COMMUNITY", THEN YOU ARE STRAIGHT UP DUMB
---
It is about running fewer servers, which is why they keep testing more and more layers every stress test.   More layers means less servers, and there isn't really getting around that fact. 
---
The alternative would have been to just host more servers to meet demand, but they clear aren't in favor of taking the vanilla/TBC approach. 
---
Tell me this.  Based on the knowledge that both vanilla and TBC were never negatively impacted by absolutely piss poor launches, and that OSRS (pre content votes) only gained players for 2 years, do you still think that an arbitrary decision to incorporate layering for the 'health' of servers is true?  
---
They are going against history of success, and that is because it poses a risk.  What do corporations avoid at all costs?  Risks.  They will take cost cutting to improve quarterly reviews so that they can maintain investments from shareholders.  Providing more servers means that their cost will absolutely go up, but they would potentially be securing a longer term lifespan for classic in a more player friendly way.   
---
Securing long term support isn't what shareholders want out of any company; they want pay outs, and a company going through a starting phase of a product going out means that investors will react accordingly in a way that isn't as profitable to the company.
---
Yeah, just like they hooked their German, French, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese friends up.
---
nice straw man kiddo
---
&gt; despite clear-cut evidence and community complaints?
---
You way overestimate the size of this subreddit. Loads of random shit that gets spammed could be swept under the rug and would be forgotten about after the game is out for a few weeks.
---
It's also common for developers to take a pretty solid amount of time to address major bugs in betas, and Blizzard has been doing a commendable job of addressing major bugs publicly within 48 hours.
---
Meanwhile we have the leeway code which is about 20 times as important as this since it affects meaningful gameplay instead of meaning a marginal dps change for content that people have been clearing for over a decade.
---
Layering allows for larger realm sizes to begin with meaning when 1/2 the characters are inactive it is still populated. Essentially, it’s either layering or smaller realms
---
Blizzard expects that there will be a ton of people trying classic, but going back to retail or quitting way before 60. If they kept the max server sizes the same, that would result in loads of dead servers a few months after release.
---
In order to prevent this there are a few options I see.
---
1) Raise the population caps. This gets you tons of people on the same server at launch, and likely healthy numbers down the road. Downside is that the game wasn't designed for mega servers, so spawns would suck and it goes against the whole idea of #nochanges. It also messes with the social aspects due to having way more people.
---
2) Keep server caps the same. This satisfies #nochanges but Iikely results in dead servers down the line that either stay dead or get merged. This would also likely mean large queue times on release which may cause people to quit right away, or  they open tons of servers, but then when the people just trying out classic leave, the servers would die even faster.
---
3) They do something like they have planned. Layering allows for mega servers at the start, but split into different layers or instances that are kept at the same population as an original vanilla server so that everyone can log on without queues at launch while keeping the number of players in line with what the game was designed to handle. Then when the population starts to stabilize after a few weeks the layering is disabled it's game on as usual with everyone playing together The problems with layering that I see are basically that people dont trust blizzard to end it after a few weeks as promised by your to implement it properly so that it can't be abused the way sharding is.
---
Layering itself is just multiple instances of the same server encompassing all zones (so if you stay on the same layer, you see the same people even when changing zones, unlike sharding in retail). You can't directly switch between layers, but doing things like grouping with people will cause group members to swap layers so that everyone is on the same later. A few weeks after release they will turn off layering and put everyone on the server together.
---
Literally any old linkin park
---
You realize you're the one that had the poor reasoning first, right?
---
Yup..It's a whole different ballgame. When the shammy needs to healtank on a 3 pull with a priest healer, and an actual war tank it all sinks in. The sense of danger is important to the experience.
---
I doubt layering is maintained throughout the life of Classic WoW. The way it seems is that it will be a solution for launch week and throughout phase 1 at the most. It would be a mistake for it to be a permanent fixture within Classic.
---
Again, you still think that +1 realm and +1 layer have vastly different costs. They don't. Technologically, they're identical.
---
I'll just assume you havn't even read my post, or refrain from using any critical thinking skills because the word "sharding" sent you into a blinding nerd rage.
---
Call it a layers, call it a shard, call it a phase. Whatever. But Blizzard can extend this phase to a whole zone, and only have them in starer zones. This way anyone lvl 30+ won't have to deal with EITHER system and the server economy isn't corrupted in the weeks we all have to deal with layering.
---
You merge small realms, not rocket science. Nothing is any guarantee that realms won't die at some point with or without layers. Layers have way more cons than pros.
---
You don't have the beta. You had access to the stress test like everyone else, which is now over.
---
Can you pm me too?
---
&gt;letting players wait in login que for 6h fuck you idiots this is what you wanted
---
joke's on you, I would never log out and my cats walk all over my keyboard when I'm not home anyway, so...
---
You made me very curious, ill look up some old footage from bsck then after work
---
I don't think anyone's disputing this. Ion said they'd definitely be out by Phase 2 and he also said Phase 1 would last "a couple months".
---
Sorry OP
---
Puddle of mudd - she fucking hates me
---
Yes, that's a problem. Good thing it's a beta so we can find these things.
---
That's easily fixed by assigning each player a preferred zone. They may get 2 different zones, but odds are they won't get a drastically improved farming experience.
---
Yo. Go back and grab the D&amp;D books. Send em to me. I’ll pay postage. Real.
---
Calm down there  mr big dick. I was obviously exaggerating to make a point.
---
Endgame kinda sucks, Naxx rogues stunlock-kill you most of the time and most classes don't get two shotted anymore. This is playing a T2 hunter vs T3 enemies, as T3 isnt much of a step up in dmg.
---
Are you tanking?
---
Cause that's what we need. More bloated CSS that makes this the slowest loading subreddit on the site.
---
I won;t play if they break Hemo.
---
&gt;By zenmastervex on 2007/10/22 at 6:41 PM (Patch 2.2.3)
---
&gt; Yes.
---
&gt; Many attacks, such as sinister strike for example, are "normalized." This means that in the formula to determine damage, the weapon is considered to have a set speed based on what kind of weapon it is. One handed swords and maces are set at 2.4. The basic formula for a normalized attack is:
---
&gt; (Attack power X 2.4) /14 = Modifier
---
&gt; Modifier + Weapon Damage= Total damage
---
&gt; So whether your weapon speed is 2.2 or 2.6, the formula is the same. Weapon damage is averaged using another formula to make sure that a 2.2 speed weapon with 80dps and a 2.6 speed weapon with 80dps both come out the same.
---
&gt; Hemorrhage is a non-normalized attack. This means that the weapon speed is directly inputted into the formula to determine the modifier. The formula for a non-normalized is:
---
&gt; (Attack Power X Weapon Speed) /14 = Modifier
---
&gt; Modifier + Weapon Damage = Total Damage
---
&gt; As you can see, the weapon speed becomes very important in determining the modifier. The slower the speed of the weapon, the more damage you gain from the attack power multiplier.
---
&gt; Just a couple examples: If you have a 2.8 speed weapon and 100 attack power, the modifier is:
---
&gt; Normalized: 100 X 2.4 = 240
---
&gt; Non-Normalized: 100 X 2.8 = 280
---
&gt; The non-normalized attack really shines when using a slow weapon, and this is why it's important to know what attacks are normalized and which are non-normalized.
---
Note the patch this was written, Hemo wasn't normalized until after that patch, TBC. When they do fix normalization I hope they don't break hemo.
---
Bottom line is that neither of us have absolute proof of either server cost point.
---
  Though my other points still stand.  They are using a feature that has never been needed in the past, because they view classic as a risk they aren't willing to get behind.

He's speaking off the cuff and literally follows up with "It's to survive launch". By this point everyone knows the purpose of layering, it's not going to stick around for months.

No joke? it’s 3.5 edition... with arms and equipment book too. 4 books in total.
---
Oh god, how can you stand the the Windows taskbar popping up like that all the time?
---
Was definitely based on what realm you played on. I played on Greymane (a normal, mid-pop server), and we called it VC. People even got shit talked and trolled if they called it DM, so it was pretty official by our standards.
---
However, I don't care either way, DM makes more sense honestly, and if you're not sure if they mean Dire Maul or Deadmines, a shift-click on their name is all that you need to figure out which one they mean

I can pinpoint the moment my heart ripped in half as I was reading this comment.

---
It’s 3.5 /:
---
I mean if i was a tester at blizzard, a bare minimum dps comparison would be 5 x 5minutes on the target dummy with a comparison of damage range, hit table, crit rate, avg damage on white attacks and special attacks- for every class, in 3 sets of gear at 60, and then again at 45, 35, and 20. That's like the bare minimum. If an attack had a damage range 20 higher than another you would definitely notice.  
---
    
---
More than likely if I was a tester at blizzard I would have a debugging mode that I could turn on and could look at the actual calculation for any attack to see the exact formula. I would also probably have a sim mode where instead of just doing the test on one character I could multibox 40 at once and have the data be put straight into a spreadsheet making it very easy to get a ton of data very quickly by one person.  
---
I think a random on a forum picking up an error in a 2 day test without a reference client that blizzard had missed in 6 months of testing really poor. Hopefully they just made some adjustments and this is a new bug. If it's been that way for 6 months that's ridiculous.
---
I started WoW right at the tail end of vanilla/ early BC, I'm looking forward to classic. Reminds me of a time when the game was much more social and fun.  I've already contacted old friends and a few are getting into it as well as a few friends who have only played since MoP.
---
Me: can I see thrall?
---
Mom:we have thrall at home.
---
Thrall at home:
---
But in reality it’s not half bad.
---
Couldnt find a solution to it staying over my WoW screen and blocking my abilities so I just went with the next best thing
---
If it's the launch day we're talking about, I think it's safe to expect huge crowds anyway
---
The server experts at Blizz disagree. If layering is only implemented short term it really will not be as big as an issue as some think it will.
---
No joke. I love older edition d&amp;d books, I play mostly fifth edition these days but the older books are great resources for ideas on stuff. Shoot me a pm if you want
---
“Nothing beats a Classic”
---
Ah, just like how vanilla was
---
did it on the test, it was fine easier than i remember i was level 13 warrior, took the green staff from hogger quest. just heal up between every harvester coz a couple misses in a row and you might have to hamstring and run.
---
Experts? You mean the shareholders? They don't want to spend the money needed, the EU realm structure is just future proof of that. Yeah "short term", we will see about that.
---
That has nothing to do with that. The cathedral you see outside is smoke and mirrors. And iirc it's the throne room you see not the cathedral. (It's on top of a mountain right?) 
---
It's the same with undercity and a lot of other stuff in vanilla. Made to look right from certain angles because you couldn't get everywhere like retail. 
---
Hop on any private server and fly into that cathedral. It's just a texture.
---
&gt;Except these are normalized too, this is what the thread is about.
---
the normalization only includes the Attack Power contribution.
---
So, if you have 140 AP (10dps) and use Mortal Strike with a 2hander the AP will contribute 33 damage to the hit. However then you have to add your weapon damage range and that depends on the weapon. Slower weapons still have their higher damage range.
---
a friend that has beta acces told me since he tested it on the beta
---
Learn German
---
And you would be one of the "fanboys" then?
---
Leave the name calling in pre-school
---
Then he needs to post combat logs, because a rumor of a rumor of a rumor does no one any good.
---
Druids can tank fine if that is all they put their talents, and gear toward. That means full Feral tanking talents, with Improved Mark of the wild, Furor, Improved Healing Touch, and Improved Rejuvenation.

Why is rag the classic icon. Everyone knows Onyxia was the main baddie.
---
Jerk'tar Ogar!
---
I like how you keep avoiding the central question.  
---
"If it was an exploit, can you point a single statement from Blizzard where they said so?"
---
They only stated they didn't expect it, not that it was an exploit, and there is a big difference.
---
That’s sick
---
can you point to one where they said it wasn't an exploit?  checkmate a
---
Yeah totally full of shit.  The point is it's based on need.  Once the pops die down it goes away.  Don't be so damn dramatic.
---
Well... People could try learning english if they want to play online games. I'm not a native english speaker either. 
---
If I had the choice to play on an international realm OR on a realm meant for my own countrymen, I'd pick the international one without a doubt. People need to get out of their comfortzones.
---
Thanks for this info... I thought this was the case.
---
That aint no better than Priest 21/25/0. That build makes PWS godly, and the damage(spellpower) bonus/regen from a spirit build is insane.
---
No, I don't accept your premise at all. First, you clearly have no background in devops, otherwise you'd know layering is pretty much identical to separate realms as far as backend resources required. Second, it's costing them money to develop and test the system, where extra realms requires none. And third, there's more reasons to believe that Blizzard wants Layering in to ensure Classic realms are all successful than that Blizzard wants Layering in to mitigate some sort of bottom line risk.
---
Some that actually like playing wow will maybe stay but still 3 streamers instead of 200 is better.

its not a rumor of a rumor of a rumor. he tested it and found it was bugged. im bringin it up here to get attention on it so i can be fixed if indeed it is bugged
---
That reminds me of something I was about to do, can't remember what tho
---
Thye manualy modified everything and they can't know if something is wrong until someonefind out.
---
In the blizzcon demo everything was super wrong, almost all of the values were from the legion client and casters had 100% bonus crit dmg instead of 50%.
---
Played wow from vanilla till now (later xpacs on and off) and god did i feel at home again after jumping into the stress test. I suddenly had goals again, i knew everything (quest/mob/leveling), it felt the same and im actually loving the modern UI. Just the simple fact of seeing someones name you had seen a few hours earlier in the start zone put a smile on my face! I didn't morn the fact that i had lost "actiony" combat (wow was never about the combat), i was more engaged with every other aspect of the game, pull mobs in this order, pull mobs them this way, remember spawn times, watch for packs...the list goes on and on.
---
I have logged into modern wow since the stress and it just felt like an empty, dead world that had a bunch of ride me signs all over the place, ew!
---
I prefer D20 but the books aren't all that rare. Still worth grabbing if you are into PnP
---
Yes and not really, in the end everyone from the states shares a country, here people have actual hatred between neighbors that goes back since before the us as a country was born. Those get passed down for some dumb reason and people hate eachother for what happened hundreds of years ago, Hungary and Romania being some prime examples.
---
Normalization is in regards to the benefit instants get from Attack Power. Slower weapons used to get more AP, after normalization it's on weapon type basis
---
You still have local servers or servers close to you..
---
The language thing sucks. 
---
But stop being silly. We will get our servers :)
---
I find that a surprising amount of people aren't willing to lose a little convenience for such a rich experience. They usually can't handle the slow combat and amount of thought you have to put into your build and your gold making and every aspect really.

I was wondering why my during the stress test, my rogue felt like it was killing faster than I remember and even from private servers.
---
Then provide some fucking proof. Otherwise this is just a rumor and is worth no one's attention, let alone Blizzard's. [There are people doing extreme testing of every little aspect of combat](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/bug-instant-attack-normalization/200006) and not a single one has reported your rumor.
---
That was one of the greatest things about vanilla was the amount of time and thought you had to put into your build. It really made each of my characters feel truly unique(as dumb as that may sound as far as an MMORPG goes). That reminds me, I need to put in for time off around launch lol.
---
Most people are going to want PI from their priests and any disc/holy isn't going to touch what elemental shamans can do burst wise because of  spell dmg coefficents and elemental fury. It's alot better especially when you add in windfury for your group.
---
It doesn't work that way. If it's in the game and it's doable with normal means it's not an exploit unless Blizzard states so and subsequently fixes it.
---
The good ol days
---
Yea when your level 13 you do fine, not when your level 11 going against 15-16 harvesters
---
It's so sad to think Blizzard still don't have trust in classic....
---
As a vanilla player who feels like vanilla wow ruined gaming in general for the past decade or so, welcome to the club!
---
Can only load this sub on mobile. It's that bad
---
Yes, you'll get your servers. Three actually. They'll be called US West PVP and US West PVE and US West RP. And they'll be hosted in Los Angeles.
---
Definitely brought back the feeling of Vanilla for me unlike anything and has me so pumped for the end of August
---
Just two more months to go!

Nobody wants to hear this out, because it has been posted a million times.

I haven't been watching for 3 years, but I second the opinion. I genuinely enjoy Asmongold's content.

Im pretty sure like latin america we will get our own little tab on the blizz boy log in. 
---
Blizz loves aussies.
---
As much as people hate streamer at least they're helping find dumb shit like this. I've been watching Asmo play classic lately and oh my god the layer hoping is fucking real, it's disgusting....
---
way to move the goalposts after being proven wrong, what a little person.
---
fIRST OFF, i DON'T ACCEPT YOUR RETARDED AS FUCK DEFINITION OF EXPLOIT.  EVEN IF I DID, NY ARGUMENT HOLDS.  YOU ARE JUST ASSUMING BLIZZARDS POSITION JUST AS MUCH AS ME.  
---
SECOND, IF BLIZZARD DOESN'T KNOW OF THE EXPLOIT, THEN THEY CANNOT FIX IT.   THIS WAS NOT ABUSED IN VANILLA.  
---
THIRD, THIS FITS THE DEFINITION OF EXPLOIT, SET BY BLIZZARD.
---
FOUR, YOU HAVE NO ARGUMENT.
---
Please Bobby B, make me your salt wife
---
OHHH, SHOW US YOUR MUSCLES! YOU'LL BE A SOLDIER!
---
You can't compare both games in terms of loading resources and traffic.
---
What is your source that you were “world first”? Killing VC is so mundane that only streamers and wannabes make claims of world firsting every little thing in the beta after years of wishing they were in the Uber hardcore guilds that only live for the world firsts. So you don’t know how many other people cleared it potentially before you but didn’t think it was some worthy achievement to brag about.
---
But you can't sac your vw if he's sapped, which any good rogue does first.
---
This was a very specific and detailed response.
---
Barrens chat... Everywhere.
---
So 9 million people can live in New York City but Fargo can only fit 100,000?!
---
Are you serious right now? They're completely separate games with separate environment sizes and separate needs.
---
10,000 people all in the same 6 starting zones would be an absolute fucking nightmare.
---
&gt; Is there something I'm missing?
---
Yeah, common sense.
---
I have absolutely 0 issue on any platform and wonder if you guys are browsing from uncooked potatoes.
---
Nop
---
&gt;  THIS WAS NOT ABUSED IN VANILLA.
---
It was. By a huge percentage of the raiding population. Just because you don't know shit about it it doesn't mean you're right.
---
But I guess I'll have to concede the argument since you wrote an all caps post, I'm impressed.
---
&gt; Not saying you dont know this but I am pretty sure this was all done on purpose.
---
I just wanted to show my experience.  Going from a full valley of trials layer and reaching Orgrimmar later that night only to see nobody there (despite there being several layers at maximum capacity).
---
The final few minutes were amazing though, I was still getting 30-40 frames and 178ms latency when we were all on the single layer and Baron was blowing everyone up.
---
&gt; Don't want people thinking this is how layers will work on launch
---
I don't think anyone can really say what layers will work like at launch unless they are actively working on the project.
---
Your skill in Protection increased by +5 "We're planning to keep this".
---
Yes, I am that jaded.  Which is to say that I've been paying attention.
---
The internet is for corn!
---
Yeah I've never understood it myself.
---
lol brutal
---
Lol, you just defeated yourself.

Every single one of the Latin American and Brazilian servers is hosted in Los Angeles. They bitch about it all the time.

Eve is a spreadsheet simulator while WoW is a game. They’re different things.

&gt; skeletons lasted long enough for a single gold farmer to spell out an entire website's name in ironforge and persist for quite a while, and it was done with 1 body to boot.

It is possible people doing things like this is a factor as to why they changed the timer on it.
---
I think it looks great, it's clear you have talent. His stance, however, needs to be more dynamic and bold. As it stands, instead of being the fearless warchief of the Horde, it looks like he's helplessly watching his frostwolf take a dump on the rug.
---
For the longest time as I kid I thought Ony was his mom and Paladin dude his step dad lol
---
That may not be true. In the first two closed stress tests people had to “zone in” to each zone they entered. There were people lagging at the boundary from Elwynn to Westfall and going into Stormwind. It took several attempts before it actually worked and gave an error message along the lines of “error zoning into instance.” 
---
Blizzard may have worked out the kinks in that before the open stress test or abandoned it entirely because nothing like that happened over the last two days.
---
I believe this is how it actually worked.. out in the world however, nah Fam that ain't it.
---
The joke:   ------&gt;     .

Can you share it with me too.
---
that poor oppressed streamer
---
And do you have any proof to back that statement up?  Am I suppose to accept that you do have background while you sit there already dismissing what I have to say?
---
Again, you keep going back to that point, but feel like arguing the other ones, or just going to fall back on the classic strawman?
---
So...10% of spellpower means it doesn't scale?
---
Because completely different game design. Your comparison is really bad. When you don’t play EVE you should not try using it as a base of comparison. EVE is built to support that many people on one server through design. WoW can’t do it due to its design. Limited space and limited resources for the players.
---
You're missing a lot.
---
Title is really misleading. He didn't join the group to escape ganking, he was invited and then commented on how stupid layering (it's sharding) is.
---
Yes in a sense. Its weird to explain, but their number system is made out of 20s, and it starts at 50 with how they say it
---
50 - halvtres (tres = 3 twenties)
---
So that means how 50 is said is half tres. But you'd think half of 3 twenties would be 30 right?
---
But in their system it would be 2 full twenties and half of the third, but you just say that latter.
---
Which is why 90, "halvfems" is basically 4 full twenties and half of the fifth.
---
It is a logic system they get a lot of shit for, but it's hard to learn as a foreigner going in, but becomes very simple after some time.
---
Source: I'm Norwegian with lots of family and friends in dk, and I lived there for 4-5 months attending a school :)
---
It sounds like they’re building automated systems to de-layer realms as well, so three weeks after launch one populated server may have 3 layers while another has 1.
---
The Latin American and Brazilian realms have always been hosted in Los Angeles and they have cross-realm functionality with US realms in Retail. It's very unlikely South America will be getting their own realms.
---
I think the problem with Westfall is that many of the quests require non-quest dropped item from mobs, which takes a very long time to gather, especially with a party. But for watchers, definitely the best bet.
---
You're correct ish, they don't say "fems" though, they still say 100.
---
But yes, firs is 8p, and halvfems is 90, because its "half" of the fifth set of 20s
---
Or how about this.   Now just hear me out.  
---
We accept the fact that Blizzard is going to do layering just like they’ve said all this time, and we stop making 50 posts about it every day.
---
Before normalization two things mattered.  Weapon speed, and damage range.
---
A blue with a lower DPS would outdamage a higher DPS epic if the speed difference was big enough.
---
This was especially true for hunters, which is why Aimed Shot and Multi-shot got the nerf despite not being insta-cast.
---
Normalization was added to prevent weapon speed from having as big an impact on weapon DPS (though damage range means it still does) since weapon speed didn't cost "points" when they were designing the items.
---
I prefer the classic stiffer models over the bouncy new ones. My orc in retail cant run without stabbing himself in the face, and his body sways all over the place. Tauren now look like they started to run too fast for their own good, so they're constantly toppling over their own feet trying to maintain balance and not fall on their face. And the way cloaks look on tauren is horrid now.
---
Oh no. I have become apart of top ten anime deaths. 
---
Dont worry about it. 
---
Blizz will hook the aussies up because we are pretty chill. 
---
Thanks for the giggles though.
---
I'm a VC guy, but what I like more than my opinion is starting and stoking DM vs VC fights in gen chat.
---
&gt; And third, there's more reasons to believe that Blizzard wants Layering in to ensure Classic realms are all successful than that Blizzard wants Layering in to mitigate some sort of bottom line risk.
---
We've had multiple mods including our actual CSS dudes try to replicate this and no one can get the same issues to occur. I think the current theory is that some addon/extension on specific browsers is causing an issue, but still we're not sure.
---
Yep, I expect it's designed to aim for a population range. As layers drop below the minimum (probably a weighted minimum to account for fluctuations) they merge.
---
The key ring isn’t in the beta either

They said layering would only exist for like 2 weeks, I'd honestly prefer 1 week but that's just me. 7 days would be impossible to truly abuse layering asides only one thing, the gurabashi arena.
---
Wow... you so coool
---
The thing is that you are all little kids and idiots. Blizzard said, and I repeat what they said, the plan for layering is that it disappears by the time you reach 60, so weeks then it's gone forever, and if you thought a little, you can see that you idiots will be all over the forums, and already kind of did, about how they plan to address leveling congestion. But ofc, you are all little kids and you all want to roll on Sodapoppin's server to gank/snipe and layering is in the way.
---
Ok that didn't work for you? Well they said that they will remove layers little by little that by the time you are 60, they are completely gone and everybosy on the server should be on one layer. But ofc that was mentioned on this reddit already and we have idiots who posted images of a full bag of black lotus LUL
---
Definitely having people help along with the I'm sure 8000 people also there to help or get their own axe
---
He's not saying "allow them to do it easier" in fact he's stated several things that would make it harder than the current state of the game (Must be out of combat, must have a cooldown on channel switch).

The interview where he said stacking was intended, but not getting them all and raiding?  That interview.
---
You are right, I win.
---
Would all of those icons really make sense in a classic wow subreddit, though?
---
I'm not trying to poop on your idea though, or the newer classes (monk and DK are two of my favorites; Monk was my main back when I still played).
---
Play the one you think looks cooler. both are good options
---
Yeah, there's so many small things that make such a big difference. For me, it was chat. I'm so sick of spam. So much spam that it makes it even more single player. General chat in Durotar was off the hook and was a quarter the reason I had so much fun.
---
Absolutely not! I just couldn’t find vanilla icons 😁
---
Draw distances and lag??? I said it's because you're moving from one instance to another. It doesn't have anything to do with draw distances and lag and it definitely doesn't have anything to do with layering or sharding or any of that crap.

"Classic is grindy and boring" - bfa player doing the same raid for the 200th time on a slightly more difficult setting to get a 0.5% item level upgrade.
---
I wish i had what he had not going to lie, but the reason isn't jealousy, it is the the fact that if you watch him, he clearly doesn't appreciate what he has, and he doesn't give a shit about the fact that he has so many benefits as a streamer, the moment he gets to taste the negative side of it he cries like a bitch and wants to stop.
---
Sorry, I don't care. "Blizzard's tool". What a pathetic, paranoid crazy person you are.
---
Yeah there was generally about only 1 other person in the zone with me on test server 3.
---
Never in my life would I ever play a gnome for any reason.
---
Yes we can lol. imagine actually thinking people will learn basics of a language though a video game
---
Cheaper materials and consumables because of saturation is a good thing for the economy. Buying things cheaper is never a bad thing.
---
&gt;And it will have a negative impact on the raiding scene. 
---
What negative impact? Raids will be cleared as soon as they are available with or without world buffs.
---
Testing layering at this level of the game, this far through the beta, is pants-on-head retarded.
---
If layering is only meant to be active in the starting zones, or the first week/two of the game, then test those conditions, not layering across the entire game, for the full duration of the beta.
---
And what more do they need to test with it? Clearly the system does what it's meant to do, and clearly what it's meant to do, is not in line with the vanilla experience, or what people actually want.
---
So am i..you are not alone.
---
Current WoW ruined current WoW for me.
---
The first thing players will do is install questhelper.
---
If anything national pservers become a bane to themselves unless their country can really support that higher pop numbers.
---
10k on one vanilla server is aids tbh. 5-6k would be ok
---
xXArthasslolXx
---
Blizzard excludes you from sales, hikes up prices, and doesn't invite you to esports competitions.
---
Yeah, they don't care about you.
---
Adblocker on firefox is the only extension I use. I keep is simple :)
---
Classic has easy purples. Classic has quest helper. Classic is easier than the rest. Your confused about what happened after classic I think.
---
Completely dead server = very few players. I enjoy having people around myself so I'd prefer to roll on a server with layering that won't be a ghost town after a few weeks.
---
 Careful with that edge kid...
---
Oh, that's unfortunate for them I guess but the good side is that I'll be able to play lag free with them then. 
---
Thank you. 😁
---
That's because I'm specced Frost.
---
I did 16hrs of questing straight with just small food and toilet breaks. I had never ever in my 10years + playing wow had I enjoyed leveling so much nor leveled so long in one hit. (Started playing when BT came out, I never played vanilla wow)
---
8hrs on a undead warrior questing with a mate then
---
8hrs on a troll hunter questing with a different mate who had to work during the day xD
---
It was a bloody good day ^^
---
lmao are you retarded?  You didn't prove a single thing wrong.  The end of layering is based on populations and it is temporary.  Hence the different answer by devs.
---
Also nice buzzword of the day.
---
Then go shadow and never heal him once.
---
Stone form is your only saving grace against warriors.
---
What an idiot.
---
Except this is one area of the game that is a 1-2% difference from the target.  Why worry about something that is 1-2% off (read: go through the trouble of doing all of what you just wrote) if there might be other, much larger, bugs to fix?  I’m sure they tested damage and saw it was pretty damn close and moved onto the next huge obstacle they had to tackle.  Not to mention this affects only instant melee attacks.  I get that you think it’s huge, but looking at it from blizzards perspective if they wanted to get this to us before 2030 they can’t be anal about every single 1-2% difference, it’s nonsensical.  It’s better to get it close, have players test it and see what they come up with.  That way you aren’t spending years trying to find every single small bug.
---
Sounds terrible. Imagine doing 10 raid tiers and the whole time there's only 1 decent tanking spec lol.
---
I actually had a similar experience like a year ago when i re-tried classic wow on a private server. Because i didn't touch wow for over 9 years then go back and get re-blown away by it.
---
This is also something that doesn't exist as much in even burning crusade. This style of play was phased out over time but was such a amazing balance back then that it carried WoW for years. If anyone is genuinely curious what i mean, go level up a character on a TBC private server. Theres a huge story behind why this occured and to be honest I only give about 30% blame to blizzard.
---
Shadow priests are beasts in PvP and i think alot of the priests will play PvP mostly, healing dungeons as shadow is definitely viable
---
While you started off asking about Factions your mainly talk about the difference between your / your friends play styles. Sounds like you’ve made up your mind and want someone to either say it’s ok, or give you a compelling reason not to.
---
Either way, Factions or play styles, I say go your own way as you will enjoy it more than conforming to something you already say you don’t want to do. Or play with your friends in one faction and go your own way in the other. Maybe they will join you going your way, maybe not. Maybe you’ll play more with them, maybe not.
---
I have a sneaking suspicion that these modern features aren’t natively supported in Classic WoW. Sharding each zone probably required a lot more effort than layering the whole game world. In one of Gurgthock’s interviews he mentions not having the Retail dynamic spawn system available in Classic.
---
What if they made major cities unlayered and made it so you can only move between them in capital cities or instance portals?
---
How is it toxic if we want to play with people who understand us?
---
&gt; It's going to last like 3 weeks man.
---
&gt; [Months](https://youtu.be/UHMd0KC3eTY?t=779)
---
petty and little
---
IMO, swapping in rested areas is a more viable version of this suggestion. Regardless, I don't think either need to happen.
---
I love watching peak hate. The people you hate do the exact thing you want them to, and you find reasons to hate them even more. 
---
It’s refreshing to see the human condition at work.
---
Kindly point me to that interview then.
---
Competition, you're not getting a fresh untouched layer when you swap. Combined with higher resources being time gated, it's a minimal advantage.
---
Make your boyfriend go priest. All you have to do is make a pouty face and say I don't want to play a healer.
---
It takes so much time to fully level/gear a character that you may as well just play whatever you want. If you don’t then there’s a good chance you won’t stick around long.
---
Huh, really? I must've misheard. I do remember them bringing up spells in a zone, maybe it was more that the new version try to process everything so fast (no batching) that they have to limit it now, but vanilla is easier on current hardware?
---
AFAIK this can't happen because tags reset only on combat reset, but combat reset results in leashing, evading, and health regeneration. So attacking Kazzak would preserve the tag for the people who initially engaged him. I could be wrong, though.
---
How so?  I didn’t see him join a new group or anything that would cause him to switch layers.
---
Go warlock. Never share your healthstones.
---
You're so angry you're not even saying things that are remotely true. There is no crossrealm. I legit can't understand you people with your hate on layering. It's a temp measure and will be removed once stability is achieved. Layering does not ever pull people from other servers. Those people are on your server and just phasing and and out as needed for the server to not crash and burn. 
---
At least get your facts straight when you sprout this drivel.
---
We were actually talking/laughing about doing this in discord last night
---
The best part is, you can layer YOURSELF. Every character you Create is on a different layer meaning... Create a lvl 1 alt, logon, logoff, logon to main and just like magic, you're now on layer 2. Repeat for endless resources. 
---
After everything I have seen, I'd rather have  500 players fighting over the same boar then have layering. Even if they disabled after a week, people who played with layering would have a permanent head start on everyone who missed out. 
---
Eve Online had a similar situation that gave original players a massive advantage over those that missed it once it was changed. It made gaining new players impossible and choked the game, creating a lose lose situation for the company, pissing off its most hardcore fans if they took it away, but significantly discouraging new players if they kept it in. 
---
I hope they listen. I'd even prefer sharding starting zones to layering the entire world.
---
Lisbon is fucking amazing.
---
Eve online server is multithreaded. You clearly don't understand why that is a huge deal.
---
 acckkkshhhually, this sub is fine
---
This post was going to be approved and was totally fine until the closing two paragraphs. I'm convinced this is just a bad attempt at trolling, so your post has been removed.
---
Two answers for two devs based on an unknown number of players with an unknown longevity.  Your point is completely irrelevant.  Maybe it's 3 weeks, maybe it's 3 months.  It's still temporary.
---
Also maybe you should take a break from these forums.  Everybody else seems to be having a good time except for you.  Be miserable somewhere else.
---
Hes enhancement this time around.
---
\&gt;  I dont play EVE
---
At this point in typing, people with sense would stop typing and realize that maybe they aren’t exactly qualified to ask why Blizzard cant do what Eve does.
---
So you could end up on his server without knowing it, level to 60 and suddenly be stuck with either rerollig or dealing with potentially 1000's of twitch kids following him around.
---
I've always played dps on every game, thought it was time to do something different.  
---
Did WC last night and it was pretty fun. Think i'll stick with it. We'll see though.  
---
I never played classic haha
---
Darude -Sandstorm
---
Flasks were never really needed or actually used a lot in Vanilla, not even in Naxx. Flask usage overall was pretty limited and generally it felt kinda as a "big thing" when a individual player popped a flask. They had their uses, but every fight is doable without them. Its more or less a pserver thing where is common to have every buff in the book, including flasks, each and every raid
---
I was there.  The hell, I don't know lol.  Now you have resorted to lying.  World 1st KT kill they had 2 of the 7 world buffs.  This was not used by a "huge %" of raiders.  
---
Five, Blizzard could have seen the exploit, but ignored it, because the content didn't matter anymore.  They were handing out welfare epics like crazy anyways.  tbc was right around the corner.
---
Hahahah, nah. He's too torn between Warrior and Warlock.
---
Then why isnt it limit to the starting zones?
---
I talked my wife into rolling a shaman, just by saying she would basically never have to do much in the way of farming and it would be easy to keep her raid spot.
---
She was sold.
---
TBH Priest is a really strong and interesting class in vanilla.
---
You have no clue what you are talking about...
---
&gt; tbc was right around the corner.
---
yet they didn't remove them until far into TBC.
---
You clearly underestimate your power as a woman in a relationship.
---
Will playing mage be hell since it probably will be the most played class? Or is it still worth rolling even though it’s mass played?
---
Mage is the only class that fit me 100% except shaman, but I’m rolling on alliance due to friends.
---
Rogue and Warlock look pretty cool \^\^
---
People that claim that this is not an issue are obviously not from Europe.
---
At the start of the stress test in Northshire, I made a similar suggestion several times in general chat and groups I got in. “Let’s make a raid group to get through the starting zone.” This zone was a beast on both the PvP and PvE servers I started on. I ended up staying in the PvE because it was a little lower pop, therefore more tolerable.
---
Idk the technical limitations, but SOMETHING needs to be done. Layering is so heavily abusable it has lasting implications after being forced to wait "a few weeks" until it is turned off.
---
You people are the bitchiest little queens i've had the displeasure of knowing exist. Actually worse than the "twitch kids" you complain about.
---
This aint bfa...
---
There's two conditions for this to work right ? Player A and Player B need to be moving.
---
Why not add a 3rd and 4th condition where Player A and Player B need to be above 150ms (Which I assume was the average latency back in the day.)
---
&gt;If I'm wrong please correct me, but this doesnt seem to be the most optimal solution.
---
- sharding it's something we don't want
---
- layering is something we don't want
---
- multiple realms is something we don't want
---
And you're not lying to the players.
---
&gt; It says right there: "Spanish". You can speak Spanish on this server
---
Imagine taking anything Asmongold says seriously..
---

---
Wait.. my unscratched murloc suit card could sell for what now???
---
Layers are sreated according to demand. You might get lucky once in a blue moon but odds are you will be on the same layer as several thousand others.
---
Have you ever played on a private server?
---
Leeway is 2.5 yards. It is only active if both players are running. If one player is walking/standing/not running it will not work. It does not apply to deadzone or AOE abilities.
---
You say that now. There's a reason why Blizzard uses sharding in retail, it makes their job easier... at the expense of a immersive and cohesive world. It already sounds (from recent blue posts) that they don't think that classic will pan out, and once the launch rush dies down a bit there is very little the playerbase will be able to do if Blizz decides to keep it in the game. It's a slippery fucking slope, that's why people are expressing frustration.
---
i seem to recall even with separate realms by language that you always had non native speakers on the server.
---
I'm European, so have my own problems not related to streamers. I do feel sorry for anyone who ends up on a streamer server though. That is going to suck.
---
It's been a while since I played EVE but you aren't looking at it correctly. 
---
EVE has a lot of concurrent players but you are spread out throughout the universe. During big battles the servers lag like crazy. 
---
In WoW people tend to congregate more. Can you imagination 6000 players in Stormwind? It just wouldn't work.
---
yeah she's a keeper
---
If I’m the dev team, I dunno how much effort I’d spend on something that’s only going to matter for a few weeks to a relatively small population of quick levelers.
---
I think Spriest is valuable as an addition to a healer, so like 1.5 healers.. makes for a safe run
---
Yet history shows that it is completely unneeded for the long term health of the servers.  If Blizzard wanted to, they could advertise the living crap out of classic again and it would likely see similar results as it did back them, especially since the gaming market has grown tremendously since 2004/2005.  
---
But I do agree that the entire point is that they don't want to take any risk what so ever, even at the cost of overall consumer contentment.
---
Thank ye.
---
If there's no sense of challenge, there's no sense of reward
---
In retail, challenge is only an *optional* way to see content, so there's much less incentive to actually do the challenging content
---
Demo
---
&gt;NO. This is incorrect.
---
How do I nominate you for the most infuriating kind of comment on reddit?  
---
If you going through the effort of calling something incorrect, provide some (any) kind of supporting arguments/facts/evidence. Not saying I agree/disagree, but... c'mon man. That's just lazy and unhelpful.
---
They could put limits to it. Like you cant switch between more than 2 different layers in a 10 min window. If you want to switch layers, the other party member must be in same zone etc. These are just examples.
---
If only there was a simple way to automatically merge separate populations into a server after the first few weeks..
---
you arent a female
---
Life will be tougher
---
Same, I literally spent all morning before the stress test leveling 2 druids to 15 on a pserver, and then it felt noticeably easier on the stress test server to do the same thing, and thats even with people saying that druid forms are doing *less* damage on beta than on certain pservers.
---
Demo Shout
---
I thank you!
---
See you're already wrong. They never said it would be off by phase 2. They have said it would be in affect in phase 1 &amp; maybe 2. They have never given a set in stone point where they will DEFINITELY turn off layering... it just screams of a bait and switch to make their lives easier.
---
Yeah it looks....bad
---
Demo Shout will help you grab quick AoE aggro if you can get them before heals start going off
---
The quick levelers will corrupt the economy of the whole server through layer abuse, so it affects the server's market as a whole.
---
Don't let it dissuade you from playing what you want. Theres going to be a lot of everything. What's more important is your commitment. It may take you a while to get those truestrike shoulders but making friends and maintaining your commitment is what sets apart the people who fade out and those who continue to progress.
---
You'll find out even without being in a raiding guild theres still plenty of opportunities to get pieces and because of pvping you'll have an additional source of gear.
---
Best of luck dude
---
If I had to guess, it goes to no one.
---
[Fixed since OP was too lazy](https://imgur.com/a/B3xJjK1)
---
.. You couldn’t add Horde and Alliance symbols? 😜
---
Problem is that rogues don’t have 1 spec that works in both pve and pvp. So you’re gonna have to respec between raiding and pvping.
---
Sounds like they need real beta testers and to expose people to more content.
---
By all means celebrate the kill with your guild but to ask for blizzard to make an announcement about a boss kill seems ridiculous to me.
---
Alright man keep on using JOL on a low raid damage fight.
---
They said it's going to be for the entire first phase .. so no you are wrong
---
Alright, I'll let Blizz know you cleared layering of bugs or potential issues and that they can turn it off.
---
&gt; what people actually want.
---
What people? The people that have an interest in Classic are not a monolith. The vocal minority (i.e. the people on this sub complaining about layering) do not represent everyone who is going to play Classic. Stop talking about "what the people want", it's ridiculous to state that most people would rather have a giant unplayable mess of a launch than dealing with layering for a little while.
---
Yes you're right, it is 2 seconds.  I keep getting my cast times mixed up since I specced moonglow.  It still remains that it is a fast and effective spell macro combo.
---
10k is a lot of people for one server. Go any higher and no one can enjoy the game.
---
A functional "MEGA" server would be around 6-7000 players.
---
New water is crap. Not in my Azeroth.
---
His source is the fact that nobody else has done it.
---
That's sort of what he does sooner than later
---
To add onto op's question.. (forgive my ignorance as I did not play a warrior in vanilla) will pulling a group and then using battleshout to buff your party give you snap aggro while the moves are running to you? Like if a hunter shoots one mob and all 5 run towards him, can using battleshout give you snap aggro? I know it worked like this on private servers but I always took it with a grain of salt

---
Private servers currently project threat at 55 per person affected by battle shout, not sure if that is the value for vanilla.
---
So this proves that the citites (obviously) weren’t instanced. What the hell has everyone smoked lately. All these layering apologists needs to get a grip.
---
A world first by POWER but without Staysafe? That’s kind of strange.
---
If you replace everything in the pic but the names, you can still tell it's Alliance.
---
Might be a technical limitation. They've said it's basically all or nothing.
---
Why not just play retail then?
---
I wonder what people did when wow just came out and there wasn't a consensus on day one.
---
The whole “hey we have a super secret 1.2 client” always seemed so weird to me. If they really had that client and it was perfect, why couldnt they use that for the base of the game? 
---
I really do wonder how much we/they can rely and trust this super secret client they keep refering to. Surely there are tons of bugs/wrong formulas.
---
 Classic is easier than some of the later expansions, but let’s not generalize, it’s NOT easier than all. Cataclysm is where the big switch occurred to make the game more accessible to the casual crowd. 
---
TBC,WOTLK both were great expansions. 
---
The idea that Classic is easier than the rest is due to it being 15 years old, and the fact we actually know what we’re doing. Not completely new to the World of Warcraft game universe. 
---
Look at Legion and BFA those are the easiest expansions. Want epics, here’s a few quests scattered all over the place that will give you some. Oh want some more, here’s some mythic dungeons that’ll give them to you as well. Oh what’s that can’t be bothered to find a raiding guild we got you, here’s Looking
---
For Raid, dumbed down raids that rain loot on you also, help you can AFK half of the raid without a raid leader breathing down your neck and still get loot.
---
Define “corrupt”, because early on there’s not going to be much gold to buy their farmed items, so they’d be better off holding onto their supply until long after layering is turned off. 
---
It’s not going to be anywhere near as exploitable as DM farming.
---
Well, its been 15 years of Pservers and Retail.. Cant blame them really. But for the love of god, everyone is typing nonsense but no one adds a source/proof
---
I took my Tauren all over, from Mulgore to Moonglade, Org to UC, UC to Grom'gol, Grom'gol down to Booty Bay, back up to the STV arena, back to XR and down to Thousand Needles.
---
Running around for the sake of running around was so much fun yesterday.
---
Don't mind me, just posting a reply for future reference :)
---
So why does someone phase in behind him if this is due to view distance? Dude this is due to layering/sharding.
---
All coming from Hazzikostas as well. Who doesn't exactly have the reputation of a man who holds to his word either.
---
It's that tell-tale feeling of being fleeced... this is why I quit retail.
---
There's no more depth to PVP, these things can still happen with a way better tickrate, they just happen less and more fairly.
---
There's no extra depth from interrupting a cast 0.5sec before it finishes then having the kick batched and the cast goes off.
---
First they said only for the start. then they said only until phase 2. 
---
What makes you think they wont go back on their word again?
---
Depends on the number of targets and where your party is at.
---
Battle Shout gives 55 threat for each member that receives (or refreshes) the buff, but it will be evenly split amongst the enemy mobs.
---
Demo Shout gives 43 threat against each enemy mob affected by it.
---
If you're buffing 5 players each time, anything less than 7 targets makes Battle shout better.
---
But if you're only buffing 3 players, it's anything less than 4 targets.
---
The whole " I was able to do it so everyone who cant is a retard" is just ignoring the fact that in a 65millions people country like France or Germany where everything is dubbed you simply don't have to learn another language for your everyday life.
---
You don't bring any solid point to this debate with your experience
---
Play melee hunters, boomkins, ret paladins
---
&gt; what hardware someone is using is out of blizzards control and even if it wasn't it would be logistically impossible for them to supply every player with old hardware.
---
Ok so how about they limit framerate on the client to 10fps, that would be easy to enforce. Do you want this?
---
I played WoW hardcore through Woltk. After I quit, I played Eve daily for 10 or so years. 
---
Eve’s design is DRASTICALLY different. They have blade servers and an entirely different architecture. Their servers also have a design feature called TiDi. An analogous situation in WoW would be imagine if 10,000 players met in WPvP. The servers can’t handle that. So the game slows down every player action by 1-10-100x. If you activate frostbolt or move your character the action takes 5-10 minutes. This is a design for the large battles that let a large number of players be in one place. The largest eve fight is 9,400 and still the servers virtually died. DC’s and a terrible play experience.
---
WoW has a lot more inter connectivity between you and the game. So many abilities, timers, and cool downs. In EvE, that isn’t the case. I would argue there is much less demand for an individual playing on EvE than an individual character in wow.
---
You don’t pay my sub
---
Really terrific Info if this holds true for Classic
---
y
---
I noticed this. After the stress test, I went to a TBC private server to play around a bit and noticed that every weapon I had, which were the same weapons as in the stress test, was doing more dps and hitting harder. I could pull 2-3 mobs with ease in the starting zones.
---
Now that's a sweet set up
---
I can't determine any "good" reasons why they wouldn't separate servers by language. 
---
As an NA English speaking player I wouldn't want to end up in a non-English speaking server, especially if the majority role doesn't play out for a month or so. That would lead to, what I imagine, would be an extremely toxic environment until shit shakes out. 
---
It's bad enough hoping to avoid a "streamer server", now we gotta gamble on language?
---
Yea it's like they played stuff until they found out what they liked
---
A lot of people played Alliance back in Vanilla. This time there seems to be a shift towards Horde. I suppose returning players want to try something new.
---
At the same time a lot of people played a Rogue back then too. A lot. So there is a chance those people will pick a different class too. I won't promise there isn't going to be a lot of Rogues. But my bet is on there being a large influx of people playing Warrior this time.
---
If you do choose Rogue. Like all popular classes you will need to do something that makes you stand out. My advice is to watch guides and really learn your class. Learn how to synergise with other classes in your team. Be a real team player.
---
One of us... one of us... one of us.
---
Huh?
---
Farm dozens if not hundreds of Black Lotus, then hold onto them until ~BWL patch when they hit 80-100g a pop. This person could then run the market on any number of trade goods by having SO much gold to work with.
---
I would totally queue for 6h if it was removed, that would be a worthwhile swap 100%.
---
Good point. It really did go MAJORLY downhill after Cata. Thats when I first stopped....
---
Yeah when we all had the time to make those mistakes. Nothing wrong with op looking to be a bit more efficient with his limited time
---
History doesn't show that. We had insane queue times, server mergers, dead servers, sharding, cross-realm battlegrounds, cross-realm zones, cross-realm dungeons. All of this was a result of a server having too many players wanting to login at launch and not enough players wanting to login later.
---
And I think Blizzard knows what they're marketing capabilities and projections are far more than you do.
---
[Fixed again](https://imgur.com/a/ok8Us2b)
---
don't worry they will separate layers by language.
---
I think Troll may take the cake with fury daggers. Much more rage generation to dump when paired with Beserking.
---
To understand each other on an european server, what language would you choose? Mandarin?
---
They'll still get griefed, just not ganked.
---
&gt;Will rolling a highly popular class be worth it?
---
If that class is the most fun for you, then yes it will 100% be worth it. Its really that simple.
---
I wish my bf would play with me :/
---
Good effort, looks like he has down syndrome though.
---
Pretty much hit the nail on the head. The elitism and toxicity within the Classic/Private server community is absurd. And honestly, I have a hard time believe most of these people actually even played Vanilla.
---
WoW came out 15 years ago, most players were in in HS or College back then. That makes them all late 20s to mid 30s. If these people are genuinely that old and still act this way, then that's a bit worrying. 
---
More likely though, is that private servers in recent years were largely, or at least partly made up of people who never played Vanilla. And then co-opted the "Classic community" and used it as an excuse to be entitled to the highest degree.
---
I can’t find myself :[
---
I find it hard to believe share holders care where blizzard gets there money from all they care about it bottom line.
---
There is so much wrong with this it's not even worth spending the hour to do it.
---
I really wonder if it was the right choice to use the Legion client. Like yes, from the networking side of things it made things much easier, but with so many in-game systems like this, it's going to be reeeeeeeeally hard to weed out every last bit of legion stuff. I'm sure we will still be finding little things that are wrong for some time after release.
---
Shamans fill a different niche than paladins, I wouldn't call them "less powerful" since totems are distinctly powerful buffs.
---
I have a 2yr old too. Life also hell. Hope I get enough time to play! Good luck.
---
Im sure you can figure it out.
---
The “vocal minority”? You mean those same people that pestered Blizzard so much for so long that Classic servers are actually happening? They have good reason to complain because Blizzard has shown time and time again for over the past decade, that if complaints are not made then problems don’t get fixed, and even then it takes ALOT of complaints and outcry for them to take notice.
---
For what reason does there need to be layering in STV arena when only 3-4 people are in the area? Absolutely none and yet it is there, as shown on the video. If layering is to be in the game it should only be in the very first starting areas for each race, and something that should not occur at all in the wider game. Any blanket duration where layering exists game-wide for X amount of weeks at the start of launch is way too long. People will exploit it and it will detract from the vanilla feel of Classic.
---
Roll what you enjoy, first and foremost.
---
If you're worried about getting the BiS raid gear, it will be slower than druids, but it's not like raids/5-mans are opposed to having an abundance of mages
---
You don't have to if you don't plan to raid. And even if you do want to raid you can spend just go enhancement and totem twist while doing less dps than a tank or spend your time oom as an elemental shaman.
---
Or maybe you will be lucky enough to join a guild that will let you play whatever you want. If you don't mind being carried.
---
Problem is, i cant play a horde dwarf druid :(
---
At least give them some credit.  They're probably baked potatoes.
---
(☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞

The amount of people quitting befor level 30 is so big u wont even have to worry about it

Bobby "Do You Guys Not Have Jobs!?" Kotick strikes again!
---
Is yours an adorable little girl who is far too aware how cute she is and is actually evil incarnate too?
---
&gt; the normalization only includes the Attack Power contribution.
---
I see.
---
Now why do I feel that the overall difference between high damage/slow and low damage/fast weapon would therefore be absolutely miniscule?
---
How much of damage in an endgame raid is just the raw weapon damage and how much of it comes from AP?
---
these are 33 year old bald dudes with goatees crying about a streamers
---
Don’t tell me which race to play.
---
No focus in classic.
---
young teenager Thrall
---
it's not about being able to speak english but about being more comfortable with your native language and having enough people speaking the same language as you to fill in several servers, that blizzard chooses to ignore
---
Awesome suggestion. Unfortunately you are not working on blizz
---
Because then he’d have to think twice about all the streamer dick he sucks.
---
Catakids...  
---
I read this in Cairne's voice.
---
Why do people on this sub constantly spread bullshit about things that they don't understand? Seriously, I don't think I've ever seen a bigger cesspool of misinformation and people willing to spread it because it confirms their biases.
---
Anyway, are you aware of the fact that AP normalization only affects instant attacks? For Vanilla melee classes, autoattacks tend to be around 50% of their overall DPS. The 4% increase only applies to the other half, or rather just a part of that other half - it also does not apply to instant attacks that don't use weapon damage calculations (Bloodthirst), damage procs (poisons, oils), sapper charges, oil of immolation and other similar things.
---
 And that part about crit is kinda random - you do know that 4% is 4% regardless of your crit chance, right?
---
This also applies to important world drops, like Devilsaurs in Un'goro, they're huge money.
---
I think what he's saying is that if you want to build threat on your party when you're tanking them, you need to do Battle Shout.  
---
I think Perri Piper did a Battle Shout in one scene and everyone in her party went straight to her.
---
Because EVE Online has:
---
 - Server tick rate of 1Hz(yes, once per second)
---
 - The entire game divided into discrete Systems, it's not a seamless open world
---
 - Blade server architecture which allows it to allocate more or less server power to particular Systems sorta-kinda on the fly
---
 - Time Dilation, where the game literally slows down to as much as 10% normal speed when things get too intense
---
 - Superior Stackless Python Master Race Spaghetti Code
---
This just isn't correct. Rogues are one of the few, if not the only DPS class, that doesn't lose out on premade or wPVP viability by using the same spec for both PVE and PVP.
---
Warriors need to respec to Arms.
---
Warlocks need to respec to Soul Link.
---
Mages need to respec to POM+Pyro or Shatter.
---
Hunters need to respec to deep Survival
---
Once I got raid daggers, I used [this spec](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/30530310501135-302305002001-05) and competed on meters in every raid while still being able to eventually hit rank 11 for my mount.
---
Was it the absolute best spec for PVE or PVP? No. But I was never so far gimped in either scenario that I needed to respec constantly. There really isn't another class that can say that.
---
Please tell me how tagging a mob with 400 people competing is different than 4000? You’re fucked either way
---
You're assuming they can manage layering on a per zone basis. Maybe they can, but as far as we know, that's not how it works at all.  If they can end up doing that, then I'm all for it. If they can't, and the choices are layering as it currently is, or no layering at all, then I'll choose layering every time. I would guess most average players would as well, which is why Blizzard is implementing it to begin with.
---
Blizz has a standard they like to hold for polish and general player experience (yes they fall short of that plenty of times). They have stated they want to maintain that standard with Classic as much as possible. They are not just going to let Launch, the most important period for attracting and retaining new players, be a complete disaster where no one can even quest or play the game the way it was intended.
---
You're good at rationalizing getting shit on by Blizzard.
---
Welcome to a glimpse of what we had to go through 10+ years ago. You explainedit perfectly.
---
I have (somewhat) fond memories of it taking nearly 6 months to level up to lvl 60 and getting my first mount at 40 was an achievement in itself. Things like Scholomance and Stratholme were a pipe dream and only very few people completed them.
---
I love wow and always will, but there's notl denying it's become A LOT more accessible over the last few years to what it used to be back in the first couple of years of release.
---
You forgot polish and russians. Kurwa and Блядь
---
I'm still not sure how he can force himself into a new layer - someone care to explain?
---
They were never hard, it's just that there were a lot of MMO newbies. As someone who came from EverQuest, we would always complain how easy and watered down WoW was in comparison.
---
From playing a test version of the game where the focus of it is testing things...
---
...layering was too easy to switch.
---
Almost like you can't compare a world designed to hold 2.5k-4k people max at a time to a game with a literally galaxy to explore.
---
I would always stand in there with my gnome because it makes you like 95% submerged. Never took damage.
---
lol'd
---
yes but not as good as their native language
---
You were on Asmon's stream! He mentioned you by name! [link](https://youtu.be/cNlUAoEygwk?t=440)
---
Another thing to consider is demo shout can be resisted. Battle Shout is usually guaranteed threat even on red/skull mobs.
---
no.
---
awarded accordingly
---
Don't listen to these other posters, they don't know wtf they're talking about.
---
wpn dmg works like this,
---
14 atk power = 1 dps
---
wpm dmg + atk power/14 * Atk speed
---
example:  Before normalization.  wpn:  3.6 speed 2h axe deals 200 dmg per swing.  You have 840 atk power.  
---
wpn dmg:  200 + 840/14*3.6 = 416 dmg
---
Atk speed normalized to 3.3
---
wpn dmg:  200 + 840/14*3.3 = 398 dmg
---
Okay, now a 3 second speed wpn with the same dps and normalized.  (200/3.6=55.56 dps).  3*55.56 = 167 dmg
---
wpn dmg:  167 + 840/14*3.3 = 365 dmg
---
Vanilla, TBC, and wrath did not have that many dead servers, and in most cases (not all sadly) servers were merged in reasonable haste.
---
Yes, we had que times, but vanilla launch was immediately followed by an accidental shipping of an extra 500k copies of the game before they had enough servers to hold them (stated by Mark Kern multiple times, one of which in a classicast video).  Despite that, I don't think I ever had to wait more than 15 min to log in.
---
And TBC, which I would argue had a worse launch day due to alliance and horde being lumped into the same, single starting area for the first time, was nearly unplayable, yet the ques were 5-10 min (over 1.5 million people joined the game leading into TBC and within the first week), yet people were willing to wait and they were still capable of moving forward after launch day.
---
Why even bring up cross realm crap?  The game lost 2+ million players a couple months into cata and had stopped growing in the second half of wrath because they had started to transform the game into the modern trash heap we see today.
---
None of that crap was needed, and all of it could have been reverted had they felt inclined to do so.  Instead of removing QoL features that drove millions of players away faster than they joined, they decided to keep taking the streamlined path and clearly didn't want to spend all that much money on the game anymore...remember the content drought in pandaria?  Should I even bring up WoD?  
---
Sorry man, I absolutely cannot jump on board with this instant gratification mindset.  People wont leave due to ques.   They never have, and they never will so long as the game is good.
---
I'd much rather end up with the "twitch kids" than the cesspool that is this subreddit's vocal population, to be honest. I'm confident that some people on here will never enjoy the game because they're stuck always looking for something to be outraged about.
---
&gt;No group finder
---
I'll never understand why people believe that making it easier to find other players to play with is anti-social.
---
You don't make friends by screaming in local. You make friends by playing together. Group Finder makes it easier to find people to play with.
---
Weird flex but okay..
---
Omar?
---
More people will leave the game because of no Layering than will leave because of Layering.
---
Well, isn't this exactly what Classic is going to be? Except there's 3 tiers.
---
They will hook us up with servers 
---
Stop being silly
---
You seem pretty grumpy at a company that produces games. You can just not play there games? 
---
Your not really entitled to it.
---
&gt; would therefore be absolutely miniscule?
---
it's not  miniscule but it's not so big that a slower weapon is better than a faster one with a much higher dps.
---
Layering is in complete contradiction with "the way the game was intended to be played" though.
---
The game is not meant to be played by exploiting server layering mechanics to avoid PVP, or to easily farm herb/mining, or to farm rare mobs and world bosses.
---
The issue of stability in the server self-rectifies as people level and spread out, as well as queues to reduce the rate at which people enter the server.
---
If they can't localise layering to specific zones, my preference would be to do away with layering altogether. Classic is about reliving the vanilla experience as close as possible, in all its rough, unforgiving glory. Competition for resources/mobs to complete quests in the early game is a part of that.
---
I think you’re highly overestimating how easy black lotus are to farm, especially if multiple people power level and try to farm them. There’s not a whole lot of control over which layer you’re hopping into, and the lotus could be any of a dozen spots on each layer. You may keep popping back into layers you already checked only to spend half an hour running around checking all the spawn points. Remember that pservers buffed the crap out of their spawn rate compared to Vanilla. The odds of any one player getting 100 Black Lotus, even with 5 layers, seems preposterous. And if the market is flooded with Lotuses in Phase 3, they will drop in price.
---
!remind me August 13
---
!remindme August 13
---
Nah, you're right. The only way a rando could steal a kill is if said rando tagged Kazzak (or really, any boss/rare/elite/regular mob) right before the raid attacked it and somehow never noticed that the loot wasn't theirs (big grey nameplate).
---
Herb mining is the pre 60 epic mount Meta tho. You don't need to track both. It's called Gatherer Mod.
---
&gt;That would be like saying cross realm LFD/LFR means that there are no individual servers.    
---
That is pretty much what I'm saying. Yes separate servers exist. With cross-realm and sharding, they are functionally irrelevant. From the player's perspective they function a single giant server in all measurable capacities. They have been this way for years. 
---
&gt;They're not.
---
This is a cogent and intelligent counterpoint, adding much to the discussion. I'll give this one to you, you got me with your wit.  
---
&gt;  Blizzard has explained that they're different
---
Blizzard says a lot of things, we'll have to see in classic live. All signs point to layering being a terrible system, but we'll see.
---
&gt; because it's retarded
---
Use your big boi voice and tell us how you really feel
---
I see it!
---
Clearly a dwarf in wc3 and the lore even mentions that gyros are no longer gnomes
---
Eh. Speaking as a vanilla shadow priest, he’ll heal fine in shadow. Plus no one can look at your talent trees so the only way they’ll know is if you pop into shadow form
---
I speak English and I'd roll an alt of this server..
---
Only if it was RP-PvP though so I can play as a true tourist..
---
i cannot provide proof since i dont have acces to the beta you dumb cunt. holy shit
---
hes terrible at the game anyways this would be a good thing.
---
And removes the incentive to add people to replay with since you can just use group finder to find new people.
---
"fellow Americans" as if America is the only country in NA.
---
Thats what I've been wondering too. In my memories AOE threat was always a issue with 5-6 or more enemies. Viable, but there where always mobs breaking out due to unlucky misses/ressists. If that calculation above holds true then warriors will be the undisputed kings of AOE threat.
---
Dear lord this was rough to read. 
---
Multiple other solutions have both been proposed already or are easily apparent to even a simpleton. Layering is one potential solution, sharding is another, more servers with merges/transfers down the line is another. And yes, some people don't even consider the "launch day congestion" to be a problem. There are pros and cons to each, but we certainly don't need stupid hypotheticals like "what if there's nothing else blizz can do?" 
---
As to the release date, you're wrong. People have waited forever for Classic and can wait longer if that's what's needed. Remember when Blizzard said "when its ready."? It's not a coincidence that Blizzard dropped that line at the same time as all the bullshit that has killed retail started showing in the game. Being too afraid to delay a game and make it perfect is new Blizzard and people want and expect the old Blizzard philosophy when it comes to Classic.
---
And your last sentence just shows how little you actually care.
---
Yep it's stupid, they're all pve servers now
---
They've both been quite faithful in the recreation of Vanilla wow in philosophy and gameplay/content, while adding many qol and architecture updates that improve the game, all the while sticking true to the vision of classic. 
---
The phased roll out is indicative of this, while layering and a few other points stand out as sore spots.
---
Sorry this was super late
---
Current wow has ruined current wow, nothing to do with classic.
---
Complains about the dissemination of misinformation and then goes on to provide alot of information with no sources linked........
---
&gt;But I like Asmongold
---
Don't go around saying that in this sub or you will be called a 12 year old virgin.
---
Eew, everyone running around with fantasy names? That's so lame. I'll take "Roflxdd" in the guild &lt;Easy Game GG&gt; any day over something like "Arion" in &lt;Believe&gt;. Eew, just eew.
---
Or dynamic spawning in the starting zones... the fifth option that original vanilla wow had and you completely ignore
---
The option that has 0 impact on gameplay past lvl 20 is clearly the best
---
You also get 35% bonus damage to tens which flat out shortens kill time by 1 sec , plus more rage generation which you are starved of during leveling.
---
fwiw I enjoyed the read and echo a lot of your sentiments
---
Is there any lag in the situations shown on the image? This was not possible in Vanilla without incurring massive server issues.
---
This is me too lol
---
Imagine that, actually adding people you actually like rather than random morons you have no choice but to play with because the game is being obtuse on purpose.
---
I'm really rooting for this!
---
This! ^^
---
Great work! What paints did you use? 
---
I think the skin looks a little bit flat on the chest and arms. If you hit it with a nice shade wash it should make the muscles and recesses stick out more.
---
If there are 5 layers in phase 1 and phase 1 lasts just over 2 months that would mean more black lotus spawned during the first phase of gameplay than the following year. But I guess that’s not a problem
---
Well thats a sub.
---
This is a very good point. As a massive fan of BC I definitely see Classic+ incorporating a lot of the balance and design initiatives from BC. 
---
OS RS has proven that a forked path of the game can be viable, and I for one have dreamed about this concept for years and years.
---

"Felt cute, might become war chief later idk"
---
Gamer bros gonna gamer bro, prepare for the offended party to furiously downvote and send angry replies to my post but it's a computer role playing game which is dominated by white males who often have pretty sheltered political views. It's annoying but you can leave general chat if needed. Or just put the people spamming "memes" on ignore.
---
I want to play a human but I'm going to play gnome for escape artist and the expansive mind is that what its called
---
When I was recently on a TBC p server, I leveled as hemo when it became available. Everywhere I read that combat is the way to level in vanilla classic. Was the TBC normalization you mention the reason why it became a good leveling spec and isn't in classic?
---
This might not be important to you because of the way you play the game. But for everyone else interested in PvP or other social interactions, this is a shitty system. Mock people all you want, but you do come off as kind of a clueless dumbass with comments such as this one.
---
Didn't read your post after seeing someone who started in Legion get into the beta. Nah nah
---
JK.
---
Good, this is how RPG games should be.
---
A sub full of subs.
---
Literally not an issue on PVE realms
---
I don't think the *@cursor* modifier works on classic realms... I'm not 100% sure tho
---
This is late, but I totally agree with this, and gating different parts of the post naxx raids with gear from interspersed bosses would be a great way to make an interesting web of attunement
---
Imo limit changing layers to major cities and/or inns, maybe tack on a 10 min delay if you recently looted a rare mob, gathering node, or chest. These were common places where people would log out anyway so seeing people disappear isn't as jarring.
---
If that doesn't work, make the servers like Chromie 1/2/3/x share character names with no transfering between them with the idea to merge them down the line.
---
I think they'll probably be top aoe even if battleshout doesn't work as it does on private servers. Consumables and engineering (bombs and Force Reactive Disk) gives a lot of thorns effects that druids can't use. Plus shields mitigate a lot more damage when dealing with multiple targets.
---
Not as familiar with paladin tanking in vanilla, but I've heard mana problems pretty much eliminate them from tanking effectively in late game.
---
how can I get only asmongold react vidoes that i havent seen yet
---
Good. Welcome to The Fam, Fam.
---
Until you try it yourself, you just DONT GET IT.
---
The comment wasn't about PVP and the effect layering has on it.  It was about specifically people complaining about things popping into view ruining their immersion.  Go read one of the countless threads on layering and someone there will complain about it.
---
Do I look like I'm writing an academic paper? Everything I wrote in my comment is common knowledge for anyone who knows a little bit about Vanilla mechanics.
---
Anyway, are there any particular claims that you find dubious?
---
It is possible to have a boyfriend and not be a woman.
---
I saw a mage in my guild do it once, and it didn't seem too hard.
---
Not being normalized is a huge advantage if you know to go for slow weapons. I think you are misreading or I'm misunderstanding you. I have provided evidence of when it wasn't normalized, I don't remember the exact patch it was, but it was a huge nerf when it happened.
---
Yeah latest it gets disabled is end of phase 1. Potentially earlier depending on how first few weeks go.
---
Because you actually had to talk to people to get a group? Made it a lot more friendly and immersive?
---
Just a small tip. I've learned russian for a while at home so I am still A1 level, but the russian alphabet is super easy to learn and in 1-2 hours you'll be able to read most of the russian words. Also it will finally make some sense, if you're slavic.
---
Agreed also. I recently tried playing a blizz like server running 1.12. Leveling to 10 is noticeably more difficult than in TBC. In TBC there were times I could get to level 10 in less than 2 hours /played. Took over double that time in vanilla and I died way more, ended up having to do far more quests in the starting zone than I ever remember doing before as well.
---
*found out what was so shit it was broken
---
don't they use layering anyways? if i understand this system correctly, they could theoretically just have one realm but on that realm there's multiple layers.
---
I am now one.
---
because everything Blizzard does apparently kills the pvp, community, economy, blah blah blah. 
---
People are bitching to bitch as if they are already lining up excuses for when the game doesn't match their perfect little world they built up in their heads.

Capital citites are not ‘kinda like instances’, and I don’t know why in the world you would think that? 
---
Look at the proof in the following comment:

No there are not, but don't criticise other for misinformation when you go onto provide info with no source. Does not need to be an paper for you to cite things. Otherwise what is stopping someone posting the exact same complaint about misinformation to you?
---
Do you realize controlling devilsaur and black lotus will be more valuable during phase 1 making it MORE likely to be camped by guilds? Controlling the spawn for 2 days with layer manipulation gives you more mats than a week after phase 2
---
Anduin got some big ass feet,
---
Don’t worry, I like your minimalist approach! That other add on might feel too big and cluttered, I might just want that easy to read spell list that you provide 👍
---
Yeah, why do we want gold farmers to be capable of this? A skeleton despawn timer change isn't particularly game breaking to me

OP with the click bait title
---
I can't even barely remember playing when I was 14, you don't remember shit from when you were 3.
---
Imagine caring
---
That spec is atrocious for both pvp and pve. I don’t think you know much about anything.
---
Every server is a PVE server because everyone realized how shitty world PVP actually is. 
---
A handful of douchebags camping lowbies or griefing quest hubs.

Enormously imbalanced factions

I misunderstood you, and at this point I don't even remember what I thought. Thank you for clarifying.
---
L-l-loktar O-gar, I guess, If you don't mind. Uh, sorry for that.
---
One of the things I was looking forward to classic was to not fucking play with those kind of people.
---
lmao, 
---
"maybe I can play wow today, I have been in queue for 3 weeks. today is the day"
---
Not in Vanilla
---
Yeah, layer hopping isn't too difficult. So you could do everything you're describing. But that layer is likely going to have people trying to grind the same mobs you were trying to grind before you hopped. 
---
So yes and no. Its possible, but the competition should be great enough to make it not worth it.
---
Ignore those polls. If you only play a class because of how popular it is, you probably won't enjoy it. Play what appeals to you the most
---
Classic was too hard so he switched retail. Adorable, really.
---
Okay kid.
---
So for the sake of argument let's say the population stays at like 90% of the starting amount at 60. There are a few particularly important farming spots. Particularly Tyr's Hand in EPL. If there's 1000 people fighting over each spawn we run into the same issue again. If Blizzard is concerned about the specific criticism of "too much competition over mobs everyone needs" why would they suddenly stop caring then?
---
Yeah, sorry about that.
---
"Denson spits on you"
---
Jeez have they really only added 3 classes in 15 years? Thought it was more for some reason.
---
well inside ironforge there was the "lagpit" you would often end up in that while you loaded all the players at the bank/ah, just like you do here
---
Dynamic respawns were in vanilla retail. Kevin Jordan said it on stream a few weeks ago.
---
So you say, but where as you and people on your side are merely assuming what could happen, people with similar thoughts to myself look back on history in regards to the original WoW and its first expansion.  
---
If you feel vanilla was truly that unbearable back then during the launch, and you know the population only kept growing during and after it,  then why are you assuming that ques would kill the game this time, especially now that servers are more powerful, the average PC decimates the game, and the average internet is also leagues faster than even the highest speeds available at the time.
---
Play the class you love, not the class everybody else wants you to play.
---
I played in beta and vanilla.  I spent tons of time, probably several days of played time dueling in front of org.  I also spent probably 10+ days doing  wpvp.  This is not how it was.  There was never any discrete line that you passed at the gates which made new sets of people visible.  That’s just wrong.
---
Well, unsourced information is not necessarily misinformation.
---
I get where you're going with this, but sourcing each and every one of your comments on basic Vanilla mechanics would be incredibly tedious.   
---
And most of my comment was also self-explanatory - if you're aware that AP normalization only works with instant attacks that scale from your weapon damage, the rest of my comment is common sense.
---
I think limiting it to cities or inns would definitely solve most of the problems the current system has.  It remains to be seen if blizzard has the ability to make something like that happen, or if they even have the intention to iterate on the system.
---
I suspect it all depends on the amount of dev work something like that would take vs the amount of subs they would loose if they don't bother.
---
I don't mean to be a downer, but all the game breaking stuff people bring up doesn't matter much to me personally.  In my eyes layering is just a better version of phasing, and I'm probably going to be okay with that until Phase 2.
---
Well yeah
---
Yes this is a canvas print on a wooden frame, this one is 120x60 cm or 47x23 inches I'll pm you the place
---
Oh boy, this thread for the thousandth time.
---
of all the hilarious 'opinions'
---
&gt; Competition for resources/mobs to complete quests in the early game is a part of that.
---
They're not trying to remove that competition, it will still be there. They are trying to ward against absurd and game-breaking amounts of over-crowding on and shortly after launch. People need to accept that Blizzard is not going to have ridiculous amounts of players crammed into the 1st several zones. It's not happening. It would be such an off-putting experience for players, new and old, wanting to try out Classic. Just look at the stress test servers that were highly populated, Blizzard doesn't want that.
---
So the options are either have layering, or have a ton more servers to spread the population out. The second options is a terrible idea, because it's very likely that Classic is going to undergo a large population drop-off after a few months. If they spread the players too thin there will be a bunch of dead/dying servers before we even get out of Phase 1.
---
We're talking about a disaster of a launch experience for who knows how long, vs a temporary shard swapping issues that the average player won't even be abusing.
---
Fear ward is purged and dispelled in group PvP, so people rate it too highly. Stone form is the racial that really sets dwarf apart from the other races in PvP. Shadowmeld is much more fun though, and also very usefull in group PvP (but less obvious).
---
Please learn to critically think.  I’m implying the current implementation is analogous to cross realm.  It’s functionally the same thing because each layer operates as it’s own “server” and can be discretely moved between.  If you don’t understand that point then maybe you’re not up to speed on how it is working.  You implying that I “don’t have my facts straight” makes you look retarded.
---
Paladins are useless as tanks in raids.  OOM, bad threat, no taunt.  They cannot push crits and crushes off the table.  Druids can't either, but they have armor to compensate.
---
?
---
To a degree, having overcrowded spawns will always be an issue. If people dislike this so much, just don’t play classic. Sharding creates more problems than it solves.
---
Phasing didn’t happen until wrath and it was only used for northrend content, with the exception of a few wotlk quests in the old world. I’m not playing classic at all. Not with tucking phasing or any derivation of it. I’d rather be on a server without phasing. Even if it meant my faction was outnumbered 2 to 5
---
They can, they just don't want to. The server caps were chosen carefully to foster a sense of community where people recognize each other and actions have server wide consequences, you can't have that with 10k people online at the same time.
---
Well to be fair this sub is has got a huge amount of manchilds... 30 or 40 year old somethings that literally have never reached mental maturity and still act like teens. Most people here are good people I'm sure (the majority of those are probably the ones that were here before Classic was announced), but there are very active obnoxious groups here that're truly ruining this sub. Those groups implicitly encourage you to voice only opinions that are safe and mainstream, but absolutely nothing that hurts their feelers even if it's the truth. It's a weed that's taking over this sub.

On this tech site that I frequent they have a system that when a member abuses the voting system, they get a warning from the moderator. When said member continues the abuse, that member gets his voting privilege taken away. It's not perfect, no voting system is, but it's the least worst I've seen.
---
Thanks for this post.  It's nice to hear about the differences in the two.  I left WOW 8 years ago and was going to get back into it because of Classic Wow coming out.  Another thing you might or might not realize about Vanilla is that cross realm dungeon groups were not around then.  You grouped up with people on  your server or with in your guild.  Guilds would partner up to do the bigger raids if they didn't have enough members.  The Dungeon Finder didn't come out untill Dec 2009, Patch 3.3 and Cross Realm didn't come out until 2011 Patch 4.3.  So imagine coming into the game when it started in 2004 and then now.  Back then when you found a good party you ran met up outside the instance and ran in together and at the end you ran out together.
---
That’s a little excessive, imo.

**Internet troll**
---
In Internet slang, a troll is a person who starts quarrels or upsets people on the Internet to distract and sow discord
---
by posting inflammatory and digressive, extraneous, or off-topic messages in an online community (such as a newsgroup, forum, chat room, or blog) with the intent of provoking readers into displaying emotional responses
---
and normalizing tangential discussion, whether for the troll's amusement or a specific gain.

Both the noun and the verb forms of "troll" are associated with Internet discourse. However, the word has also been used more widely. Media attention in recent years has equated trolling with online harassment.

"update"-  Battleshout 55 threat, per person affected, 20yard default 30 yard when talented in (definatly worth talent).  
---
the threat generated, is then divided by how many monsters there are so... 55x5= 275
---
275/5 = 5 mobs =55 threat.
---
275/1(boss)= 275 threat &gt;&gt; Beating out Sunder Armor( 261 ), assuming battleshout hits everything 
---
275/7 (battle shout) 7 mobs = 39 threat per mob
---
Demo Shout = 43 threat per mob...  (demo shout wins when there are 7 mobs or more)
---
Thunderlcap =  130 threat to each target, affecting maximum of 4. (small 8yard range) = 130x4= 520 threat  
---
I think after alot of research, ive managed to layout the situational threat scenarios.
---
Thunder clap = number 1 threat gen, when atleast 3+ enemies are bunched up (any more than 4, and u risk losing threat on 1 mob that wasnt affected).
---
Battle Shout- use for number 1 threat source, in most scenarios, even above sunder, if everyone is in range, even if single target mob.  
---
Demo Shout- demo shout only beats battleshout, when fighting 7 mobs or more, having slightly less range, be wary of wether it will affect all the mobs.
---
Simple questions get simple answers.
---
Get RES. I view almost every subreddit with the subs CSS turned off.

You're literally ridiculing someone for having a different opinion than you.

What, my small town of 20k people can't sustain the population of New York city? That's awful.
---
RES, maybe? I had to disable the css on this sub cause it was locking up my browser.
---
yes, the threat table starts when the monsters enter combat, battleshout will be the ideal way to generate threat to them, especially since theyll be out of range from demo shout too.
---
what even is a layer?? I have no idea what it means
---
Well most people won't even be 60 after 2-3 months.
---
There is a website for that. Just google „wow classic guild finder“ or something like that
---
Probably, but that sounds pretty lame. Do people hate streamers or do they actually just hate some of their obsessive fanbase.
---
Yeah, that's what I meant, I soloed them as a mage.
---
I've uploaded my data from the server 2. Well, I played mostly Horde, so it might appear the Alliance being a minority, but it's not true. The Alliance population was slightly higher (A:800; H:700). I just had no enough time to play my Alliance character more.
---
2 months seems like a decade to me at this point honestly...
---
It's called https://www.vanillafriends.com
---
Not really trolling to point out a basic bit of (even if unintentionally) hypocrisy.
---
That is so accurate
---
Does this comment even have a point? Those major content patches have come and gone and still no redesign.
---
Threat from refreshing battle shout isn't blizzlike.
---
How it changed was due to several factors but one I'll bring up is unnecessary QOL 'improvements': in making everything as streamlined as possible they made the rewards inevitably less valuable. To put it another way, the easier something is to obtain, the less value it accrues.
---
\&gt;Anyone else feeling the same way?&gt;
---
&gt;ew differences here and there.
---
Like I said...  Few differences here and there. Hardly worthy of calling it "strategic choice".
---
It's why pre character creation is a lot more than a money grab, it's to gauge interest and realize just how fucked they might be 2 weeks ahead of time.
---
I was a lot less mad about extra 2 weeks sub after realising this (very late I might add).
---
Awe c’mon, take joke mate! Just havin’ a bit of fun with ya! :-D
---
So since this is an informative thread to begin with, instead of just insulting the dude you are responding to, maybe explain what’s wrong with his spec so the OP of the thread has more info?
---
Are there specific points in his talent tree you disagree with? Because seal fate build was highly viable in both pve and pvp.
---
My compelling reasoning is my 50 days played in vanilla as someone who spent tons of time dueling in front of cities and doing wpvp.
---
Will this issue result in a further decrease in form damage in classic when its fixed? The hits just keep on coming for druids, wtf.
---
Layering doesn't even work like that.
---
Bloodthirst and Execute is still around 25% of your damage. Definitely significant
---
Jokes aside do go shadow while leveling either way. Priest leveling as shadow is way better and you'll still easily be able to heal all dungeons!
---
\&gt;I'm geeking out   
---
\&gt;Anyone else feeling the same way?   
---
...
---
You can cherry pick whatever you want to prove your point. And dont get me wrong your opinion is as valid as mine. But to me personally getting a blue item while leveling feels better than anything in bfa. Im not saying the system is perfect by any means.
---
Many whelps??
---
I agree with all this, but i’m pretty sure it should be the other way around. 
---
Most people who play retail don’t care about Classic but most post on this sub has been about shitting on retail and people who play it ...
---
It’s a good thing you made a new thread about layering because we haven’t had one in 10 whole minutes!!!
---
which one? link?
---
Bruh.
---
Good
---
It is not. Layering doesn't work like that.
---
Layering is dynamic.  There's no set schedule.  The server adds and subtracts layers as needed.  Eventually all the servers will have 1 layer, but each server will get there at a different time.  
---
Might take server x 2 weeks, server y 5 weeks, and server asmon 8 weeks.
---
I'm commenting here so I can find this later

My girlfriend tells me to give u gold, I give u gold
---
This really reminds me of Azula for some reason
---
There were (maybe still are) exploits to farm resources/mobs multiple times faster through it. Layering will go, a ruined economy will stay.
---
Anecdotally:
---
Overrun servers and long login queues will go, a healthy economy will stay.
---
So basically just [this meme](https://images.app.goo.gl/FExMV68coAGs8skx5) but less expression?
---
yah, If you levelled from 10-50 you'd also notice a lower sense of reward in items, and less replaceing. Because things where "optimized", a current game that is in falling down a actual similar trap is path of exile. I've said how poe had a lot of good ideas. Well, they are "optimizing" the game too much and now the game is so easy that you can do exactly as what this OP is talking about. Think about other stuff and auto pilot in the game.
---
Your realm is your world. You should never have to care about what happens on another realm, including what they name their characters. Merging realms affects the economies and completely destroys realm and faction identity.
---
There's absolutely no evidence to suggest that any perceivable balance issues with Layering won't be fixed by launch day and plenty of evidence to show that Blizzard is actively experimenting, testing, and modifying Layering on the Beta.
---
Private server. I know which one just by looking at the video.
---
k
---
Your words make you seem retarded.
---
Do you have a source?
---
Pretty sure 1.12 gave Kazzak a leash, so this won’t be possible.
---
Been suggested by several people before.
---
Locked layers
---
Choose a realm, then choose a layer.
---
This solution has other problems with guildies and friends being able to join a layer if it fills out before they are able to login. This is especially true if layer player limits are excessively low on initial launch to ensure starting zones aren't overcrowded.
---
Level up, find a guild, show up to every raid. You will gear up eventually, the worst part is waiting for some really strong but relatively rare drops early on (mana igniting cord, mageblade).
---
Or how about we just keep out the literal toddlers that make posts like this one?
---
"Arena will be out by the end of the year"

Eh... But why? What is appealing about enhance?

A lot of retail people are worried it will split the playerbase etc
---
Blizz lies ALL the time
---
You've done nothing but spam incoherent crap on anyone that says anything pertaining to layering. Quite frankly if you're going to be that loud and obnoxious you should be clear about your intentions. You said crossrealm and layering is absolutely NOT crossrealm. Layering itself is only a problem if you're the type that feels the need to cry because for a few weeks you can't see everyone and spend that entire time trying to camp a single spawn to kill.
---
Whether you intended to say one thing and said another doens't change the fact that you're rude and a major example of the problem with Classic and the community. OP asked a question and you bounced up and down to do nothing but flame anyone that talked, then got mad when someone called you on your false rhetoric and opted to call someone a slur just because you're in the wrong. I don't really care for layer but it's a necessary evil to make the game playable at launch. My hope is that they keep it permanently now, just so that way you and people like you, with your unnecessary aggressive and belligerent behaviour get SUPER salty and leave.
---
Aside from the non-Vanilla classes I like it!
---
Your inability to coherently respond makes you seem retarded.
---
If you're Alliance you'll be fighting fury warrs for swords and maces, but if you really want to be a rogue then just go for it!
---
Western Switzerland doesnt count i'm sorry 🤣🤣🤣

The real Vanilla experience is not being able to play for the first couple weeks

Maaaaybe they dont because they are discussion internally on how to tackle this the abuse of layering?....

Though about that?

Priests dont kill things slowly, if you're talking about leveling, they're easy to grind with.

I have a 3 step plan:

1) Make friends with a higher level hunter
---
2) ask hunter to help
---
3) murder people with my new WW axe.
---
No changes means no changes. It's really simple. Retail vanilla had those buffs - taking them away in classic would be changes.
---
Bloodthirst and Execute are not affected by AP normalization.
---
Yeah. To be fair I haven't given retail much of a chance, I stopped playing in MoP. But I've renewed by subsription 2 or 3 times since then (1 month recently to play the stress test), and it just didn't interest me. I enjoyed classic a lot, but when the test was over I tried out retail and I just wasn't interested in playing. Even the UI was worse when they moved the menu options to the right. The stats have been simplified as well which I don't like. I'm really just a casual player, so I mainly look at the leveling process and dungeons, but classic is just far superior. I personally think some parts were too grindy (like getting a mount at 40 instead of 20), but I guess the pain of the grind made it that much more enjoyable when you got your mount, or better items.
---
Granted, for most people leveling in vanilla is almost new because they've been on retail for so long, so once the novelty wears off I'm curious if people start dreading leveling another character to 60 because it takes so long. It's probably why blizz made leveling easier in the first place.
---
&gt; Imagine that, adding people you actually liked playing with
---
No one will add you after meeting you through group finder. Because the group finder is still there.
---
The amount of thought you have to put into the already tried and tested cookie cutter builds you find online?
---
Don't get me wrong, i'm hyped for classic as well and my friends are recruited as well.
---
But the amount of reverence this game receives in this sub is mindboggling to me.
---
this is disgusting
---
I feel like this Soda guy is the worst of them all...
---
I just find it funny because the EU loves to hate on the USA for toxicity, and then they go and blow up Reddit with their own toxicity cause I guess they all hate each other too lol.
---
It becomes the standard spec in high end pvp - where every team has support. In that situation ice barrier is useless because it just gets dispelled instantly (if you're being targeted), and slows/snares aren't that good because they get dispelled quickly and there's lots of free action potions and blessing of freedoms.  
---
So yeah in that situation your ability to burst becomes really important, and a powerful fireblast and blast wave on a nova is the best way to do that - and voila elemental becomes the meta spec.
---
Well no spirit of redemption is also a good indicator at lvl 60
---
It’s possible but unlikely.  I spent hundreds of hours in front of org and doing wpvp in and around cities.  I’m sure I never had this happen.  Pay close attention to how it occurs.  Nothing renders until the character passes a certain line.  That’s not how it was.
---
You don't need to organize at all. I can be the only guy in Duskwood at lvl 24 in Raven Hill. I can invite any random level 15 in Westfall and it might layer me. Just do that til it does and then repeat til 60.
---
Or lets say I'm not ahead of the pack, I'm that level 15 guy in Westfall. Well, maybe taking the invite from the 24 guy layers me instead of him. Maybe I'm in a guild already and there's a gmate who's also 15 in Loch Modan, I'll just invite him real quick to try. No, that didn't work. Oh, there are a couple in Darkshore too. BOOM, got it. 
---
It's not nearly as hard as you make it out to be.
---
So just your 5% Whirlwind
---
Get the vanilla flairs
---
sorry what is a layer? Is this cross realm stuff?
---
Posts are being locked because mods are being over sensitive
---
The thing I don't get why blizzard made it so consistent it is always the player who invites you who gets to stay if it was just random who would pull who it would be a risk to try and exploit.
---
Then there are things like getting layered to a persons layer when they might be many zones away so the layering doesn't need to happen right then and there.
---
Or hell why can you still be layered and retail sharded while in combat! That has always just been wrong.
---
A lot of private servers have english as their official language, and somewhat enforce it in public chat.  In private groups then you can speak whatever you want.
---
I would expect mages to be comfortably ahead of warlocks in MC and even BWL comfortably, even after factoring in spriest. Warlocks have bad mana problems and no free hit from talents, it's very rough raiding in blues/greens. After ZG and AQ comes out it's game on and they'll be up there battling the mages.
---
If your ahead of the pack, it likely won’t be viable to get it as there will be few at lvl 30 and even less willing to help. The best bet is guildies, or mages who are out in front levelling and potentially aoe farming Arathi who can get the charms for you. 
---
If you’re crushing a long it’ll be doable, the charms will likely be on the AH, and there will be higher levels to help vs Cyclonian.
---
There was that one warrior levelling guide, that had the guy with alchemy and nature resist pots I think it was, so that’s s consideration vs Cyclonian.
---
Except he’s right. Don’t know why the hive mind is downvoting him.
---
I would also add beside meeting stones to the list of areas where you can switch layers, along with rested areas. Still can be exploited for greifing in world PvP which sucks, but also 3 people getting there and the lock being on a seperate layer sucks harder.
---
A lesson you will learn in life is that no one listens to an asshole. You might be right, but no one will care.
---
TLDR this is bullshit.  My point is that this is 100% not how it was and this will adversely impact gameplay.
---
You know warriors basically always beat rogues yeah?
---
What should they be saying?
---
There are maybe 5 German retail server, that are no ghosttowns.
---
How did you get it printed? Through the artist himself?
---
Not sure about that, in all my years of gaming I never had such attitude from others, both in wow and in other games. I'd say it's just the general negative image, easy to pile on all other sins when somebody is already generally disliked after dropping one cyrillic привет in chat.
---
Oh, and I played many privates and some retail with fellow comrades, never seen a cheater or a botter. Plenty of professional self-centered douchebags :D
---
Idk if you read his post but he started playing in legion: he didn’t know what he was missing. So when he got to experience the magic of classic, classic ruined current wow for him.
---
Not every EU nation has specific servers and clients on retail and it still works and worked for 15 years
---
About a dozen it seemed. I have screenshots but am not near my desktop.
---
In my defense, Cairne had little to no voice acting!
---
&gt;So for the sake of argument let's say the population stays at like 90% of the starting amount at 60.
---
There's no point saying this, even for the sake of argument. No game in history has ever had more than maybe 10% of people who start the game end up finishing it, and MMOs are worse than most games for this. It's an idiotic assumption for you to be making.
---
I have joined the Anti Streamer Movement Of No Good Overly Loquacious Dorks (ASMONGOLD).
---
Lol shut up
---
&gt;Seriously, there are what, 3k on a realm? Blizzard can't possibly be so dumb as to think there won't be 3k German players or 3k French players.
---
Nah with layering there can be up to 56k on a realm apparently
---
If layering persists long enough for the hardcore people to get into the 50's, the economy of that server is doomed forever.
---
1 week of the hardcore people abusing layering and farming Devilsaur, Black Lotus, Rich Thorium and everything else will destroy the economy and put those people super far ahead.
---
That is less than a week.
---
Are you rolling a rogue? Because if you are then you’re in for a nasty reality check if you go with that dreadful spec. You won’t be anywhere on the meters and you’re not killing anything in pvp.
---
Make layering not work in combat?
---
She is, do you agree Bobby b?
---
The fuck are you on about?
---
And doms!
---
Classic response from someone that resorts to calling people slurs when they raise valid counterargument and don't have the intelligence or civility to respond. You're either a moron or a troll. 
---
TL;DR - Manchild tosses out insults if you disagree with his crap.
---
Lvl as protection like to tank instances? Plz tell me what server so I can heal you ps please play alliance. Also lvling as prot makes you a legend in my book.
---
Thats true. I had never issues clearing dungeons or getting quests done on pservers even when we had chinese players in our group. However, thats not what people are complaining about. Some value the small interactions that can happen with random people, discussions in world chat, banter etc. Personally, I never wanted to play on a German server anyways and we are already a big group of friends that are going to play on the same server. Still, I understand the outrage about it. At the end it is what it is and people will adapt. I just didnt like the OPs comment.
---
Sure they did.
---
Beautiful
---
[From Asmongold's stream](https://youtu.be/cNlUAoEygwk?t=1066), it is very laggy, though the amount of people present on this layer might be absurdly high due to being a streamer layer.
---
I wish blizzard added German &amp; French speaking servers at least.
---

---
I'm already decided on going priest myself, but shaman looks really appealing to me as well. Their utility with the totems just seems super cool, but there are...needs...I must fulfill with mind control. Revenge 15 years in the making shall be had.
---
yes bobby b, and we were forced to play retail instead :(
---
THERE'S A WAR COMING, NED. I DON'T KNOW WHEN, I DON'T KNOW WHO WE'LL BE FIGHTING...BUT IT'S COMING!

Hi, /u/Ted_From_Chicago

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c3mvaz/how_to_beat_warriors_as_hunter_in_duels/). 
---
That's a drastic underestimate.
---
No that definitely did not happen in Vanilla.
---
It sounds like shit tbh if this is what we can expect.
---
Fair point that there may be a valid distinction between layering and phasing that i failed to adequately address.  I am not sure about that.  However, my point stands that this is not how it was.  There was never a discrete line that you passed that would allow new players to be visible.  While players would load in like this in big cities, this discrete line is absolutely not how it worked.
---
I want to try this now. Having a language barrier but trying to do stuff in a group sounds interesting. But tbh, most other countries seem to speak english as a second language, while almost no english countries speak a second language.
---
That’s easier to hide since you can just say you talented into disc.
---
Are you me?
---
I wish my gf would play with me :/
---
You would lag but people would never “appear” if there were too many people to load outside you would’ve been lagging from before you could see the outside of the tunnel.
---
be good at your class and you'll stand out. a TON of people will be fresh come classic and won't be experienced / very good at the game
---
I completely agree with that statement. The sense of danger and ability to lose is very important to the experience. Overcoming a challenge is a very satisfying. But what baffles me is the same people who praise Classics leveling difficulty and joke about how faceroll retails is don't seem to have that same mindset when it comes to raids.
---
I think raiding in classic will be the easiest form of raiding we have ever seen in WoW. We're talking LFR or easier levels of difficulty here. The fights naturally have no to few mechanics and combined with the knowledge of the game we possess now, things like world buffs and having 1.12 talents in the early raids I don't think we're going to find any of that sense of danger in raids that we once did.
---
August 27 my lord, august 27
---
Stability on modern CPUs and server structures, and lack of battle.net integration are the main three reasons. They would have to do a lot of work either way, but this way is tweaking as opposed to rewriting if they used a real 1.12 client.
---
did  he really? where did he state that lol
---
If There was layering. I wouldnt want To ever see people from other layers at all. I dont want to group up with people that i Will never see again. Key Word In Vanilla is community.
---
Can you let me know as well please, not everyone can print it it seems
---
Hope we can make more people see the problem. It's not just pvp, it's also material farming that's affected.
---
I’m sure you think that but I skimmed your response and there’s no valid argument there.  Feel free to rephrase with less frills if you want to try again.
---
I blame OG Playstation for only coming with one controller and no games.  That was the beginning of the end.
---
Damn they're so right about this sub, bunch of cry babies on this shit.
---
Exactly. Then it will be there permanently.
---
This is actually a really good idea, there isn’t really a better option to layering honestly but this seems like a great fix. Hopefully the need for layering goes away sooner rather than later
---
wait seriously?? 1.7 million? Wow. Blizzard should really pay attention to what made classic so good. Blizzard threw around the idea of pristine realms 3 years ago, I think that would fix some of the damage.
---
All the layering doomsayers need to get specific. Explain to me how what you are seeing here relates to layering in classic. Why is that behavior indicative of layering. How does "instance" relate to layering.
---
Separate servers are more expensive because you will have unused computational potential idling around the clock and the merges will be more expensive as they don't rely on existing BfA tech.
---
The fine details of your gameplay experience don't matter, since it's more important to use the cheapest manageable infrastructures and maximize the profits.
---
The biggest problem is that some servers are going to become low-population realms much faster than others, some potentially from the start.
---
So far instance lets say we have Mankirk 1,2,3,4. Who the hell is going to choose 4 right away? Most people's psychology is to choose 1, then 2, and so on.
---
So 1 will fill to capacity quickly. 2 will have a moderate but sizable number of players, while 3 and 4 will basically start the game as ghost towns. Layering would allow all of these people to play with each other and fill each others worlds allowing everyone to have a richer experience.
---
The good things that layering does, outweigh the small temporary negatives in my opinion.
---
*shudders at the thought of alex the kid*
---
tbh this almost completely killed all hype I had for this game. 
---
Not even because of this issue itself, but because it shows Blizz doesn’t care as much about Classic as I thought they would.
---
Lol what. Fyi, i never watch streams anyway.
---
This sub is so hilarious. Let people do whatever they want. Even is a streamer is pro LFR i couldnt care less, altough i disagree personally. A lot of people here should move to North Korea where there is only 1 opinion allowed.
---
not to disprove your point, but I'm hella casual and I subbed just to play the stress test.
---
The irony of doing this with a Velf model lol. Is the Classic female also using a retail model?
---
These constant "boogeyman retail player" posts make you look incredibly insecure about your own opinions and turn people away from this community
---
And what is the deeper sense behind it?
---
 i mean you could just go to the trainer and look it up
---
Love your site Ive been using it every day since you made it and spent lots of time on it. However, for some reason this ring https://itemization.info/item/19325 is not included in the database im not sure what mightve caused that or if theres other items causing that to happen. Any ideas on why that may be the case and if its possible to add this item to the site?
---
If MS Warrior then Pain Redefined by Disturbed.  
---
If Stun Lock Rogue then Locked Up by Akon.
---
If Soul Linked Warlock then Indestructible by Disturbed.
---
If Shadow Priest then Fade to Black by Metallica.
---
If Elemental Shaman then Getting Away with Murder by Papa Roach.
---
If Frost Mage then World So Cold by Three Days Grace.
---
If Holy Paladin then Bring Me To Life by Evanescence.
---
IF Marksman Hunter then Remember the Name by Fort Minor.
---
Oh you're on the "durr its just the beta durrr" people....The stress test was in the live server environment. It is entirely reasonable to use data from the stress test and exptrapolate that out to Classic release. As even you youself said, that's kind of the whole point...
---
So did Faol/Bolvar engage the boss this time?
---
Hes playing retail now. Did you watch him try to play classic? He is really bad. I like the guy as a streamer but he is clueless about Vanilla.
---
Agreed, we’re all WoW fans at the end of the day.
---
Bah, who needs him? I'll play with you ;D
---
Fair point, I see that online all the time.
---
Night elf female is Alizée though...
---
I only ever heard it be called VC towards the end of vanilla and once into Burning Crusade it got called that even more.
---
My guess is after a while more people reached the level where Deadmines was a thing of the past as opposed to a more relevant Dire Maul. 
---
I’m a DM guy.
---
Agee 100% with your post and I would like to piggyback off the point of comittment. At the start there will be a lot of everything. 
---
That will definitely change even within the first few weeks. People will pick classes that they have either never played, or always played and for some the new class won't be what they excepted.
---
 Or the guy like me rolling a pally for the 15th time, might just get bored and start something new. Commitment is key because of the grind of lvling and waiting for certain spells to make your class liveable so to speak. Like OP saying he wanted to play rogue and might not know how late you get cheap shot and kidney shot, and perhaps after finding this out some would rather not put the time in to make it to those levels. And may change classes. I could be wrong but I've seen this before where people pick a class for endgame without understanding how painful the 1 to 60 is, and they can't mentally stay committed to the grind.
---
I said the same thing about RS3 back in 2013 when Oldschool Runescape first released. RS3 ruined RS3, not Oldschool ruined RS3. I've said it before &amp; I'll continue to say it many more times; Classic WoW is going to be 2019's OSRS (🦀🦀 except it' a $15 subscription instead of $11! 🦀🦀)
---
I never said it was this way in vanilla, I should have clarified that.
---
They are probably downvoting the despair or the sentence.
---
It's a huge problem on private servers, that doesn't really exist on EQ throwback servers because they have picks (different instances of the same zone). I'm glad to hear their introducing this for classic, grinding quests would have been unreal tedious without it.
---
disagree with the third one but you make good points
---
And 70 others that have some players. How many full servers do you think that would add up to?
---
Browser and what version will likely help them.
---
I'm doing the best I can.
---
They do this now with overwatch servers. Basically everyone just speaks English or doesn't speak.
---
Imo play whatever faction/race/class/spec you want, just do some research about it before, so you know the pros and cons with it
---
With the race pick, some are going to regret picking their race because they end up liking how another race looks more, while others will regret their race pick because another race is stronger
---
Both will happen, promoting cosmetics over racials just increases the people who will regret their pick from one of the reasons to the other. Telling people to gather info so they can make the best decision for themselves, are way better imo
---
Just make one or two server without layers with appropriate warning and you'll forget about us. As it currently stands, I'll have to start the game few weeks later or may be few months later, because I can't stand any sharding and that kind of sucks to miss the initial rush.
---
Whelps!! Many whelps!! HANDLE IT!!!
---
I dont count retired wow players who quit a long time ago as a portion of the player base. 
---
Now blizzard is going to have to make sure what they make is good content so people will want to stick around. If retail players move to classic it’s because they prefer it. Bring classic things to retail and they might return.
---
It’s just like market competition. It’s good for everyone.
---
gross
---
Is this where you want to be when Jesus comes back?
---
People would level up following Joana's guide with or without layering.
---
I don't understand the point of this post, I don't think this really is a discussion so much as your frustrations and disjointed thoughts; for that I recommend a diary.
---
I'm good. Subjectively I'd rather learn german. So I can sing along to rammstein properly.
---
Nope. Senses are things our brain uses interpret the world around us. Those things you bring up are feelings that are results of the 5 senses.
---
I think that it's still zone-wide sharding below. They just modified transition behaviour, so for players from the same shard in the Elwynn Forest to choose the same shard in the Westfall.
---
"Skimmed" you can't be bothered to read anything that's not in your narrow-minded view. Your posts are hidden all over this thread because you're being downvoted because you have a garbage attitude. 
---
My point was valid and clear. Not my problem you're too up your own ass to understand that you attack and insult people that don't agree with you. I'd suggest not doing that to any friends you get in real life, if you ever get any.
---
The games are made for different audiences. Classic was made for people who wanted an adventure, general D&amp;D people and so on. Current WoW caters to the casual gamer, since anything but their very endgame raids are generally hard.
---
No
---
How do I alter this addon so all I see is asmongold videos?
---
Or you know, just /who and see if it matches with the streamer
---
It’s not about hate, but as a german person myself I would be completely fine with an English server f.e. because I speak it well enough to understand most things. 
---
The problem starts when French, Spanish and Italian speaking people join the same server. The 1. and 2. Chat will be a mess because I can’t understand them, they probably can’t understand me and/or even each other. 
---
It’s just not a good experience to deal with five or more languages of which you only understand two. And I’m sure the majority of people don’t speak more than two in the EU.
---
Where is this layer cap bs coming from? Blizzard has mentioned nothing of the short and there the correlation between total players on the server and the number of layers is probably quite weak in actuality. Layering is a solution to the problem of local (read: subzone) congestion. It doesn't really have much to do with total server population. If 1000 people are on but its 20 people each across diffent zones, you probably don't need a layer. But if its all 1000 in Coldridge Valley, you'll probably need more than even 2.
---
The point is that playing the Classic version has ruined the experience of playing current wow for me. It's doesn't feel as meaningful. Don't underestimate how many new players will switch to classic and never look back.
---
Let’s be honest. It was mostly “cool” art and memes.
---
Bruh lemme get that addon. That range update is super fast compared to others I've seen.
---
ahh don't listen to the naysayers. Obviously it's not perfect but it's actually pretty detailed. It's just his posture that people seem to have a problem with.
---
I'll take my personal experience over your conjecture any day. You play your game where you shit on every spec that isn't 100% optimized and I'll play my game where I do what I want.
---
Windfury procs, class fantasy of being a melee caster, maining shammy MoP and Legion, being the only enh on the server, watching my brother's friend stomp people in wotlk, windfury procs
---
Buddy you didn’t take a position. All you did was rage about the words I used.  I have good reading comprehension.  If you want to contribute to the fact debate here please do, otherwise fuck off because you’re seriously low caliber.
---
Well Yeah, you're absolutely right. There are people who have already been here and tested everything and they've done the math and they know what's best. And when I raid, I know that I have to follow a more strict build and rotation/role.
---
But I also want to experiment and find my own way. I don't have to have a perfect build to just do some 5 man's and get halfway decent beat and level professions. I want to see for myself what I can do and what I can't accomplish without help.
---
I also love efficiency and this game is all about efficiency. And I can also get my RP on in my head as I play.
---
English is not the problem. I can write and speak it. Will there be not a single mistake? Ofc not but it will be enough for a game. 
---
The problem are people who don‘t agree and spam chat in french, spanisch and german...
---
I don't know. Most of them are really dead though.
---
That’s tbc
---
That sounds like a lot of fun, count me in as a rogue!
---
First thing I’m going to do is to see if I can kind controll people out of the exit portal near the gy in wsg.
---
Sorry but you’re wrong, and a simple google search will show you. There’s even more than I listed.
---
We don’t know how big layers will end up being.
---
Imagine thinking there are still that many people paying to play BfA.
---
I'm glad someone said this even though you're currently at the bottom of the thread.
---
There's also this old post [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20080625021841/http://elitistjerks.com/f15/t7613-rogue_mh_mace_oh_sword_swordspecc_oh_proccs/) which shows extra attacks resetting the timer.
---
&gt;If you acquire an extra attack in the middle of a swing timer, that extra attack should proc instantly and reset your swing timer, provided that you are facing your target and autoattack is active.
---
If you are not facing your target, you are far away or the autoattack is not active, your extra hit will be stored and unleashed on the first occasion when you activate your autoattack. This can still happen before your swing timer cools down.
---
It's worth noting that this means if you're a warrior spamming hamstring to get windfury procs, you can lose DPS depending on when in your swing the proc is caused.
---
I wish I had a SO
---
because whatever you say, but retail models &gt; classic models
---
Some servers will definitely still have very large populations comparable to their launches
---
 i ping 80ms to nyc from amsterdam
---
Because it works exactly as designed. You got invite, you transitioned to another layer to play with that person. What would they tell about it? There's not enough time to develop new systems. They probably will fix extremely abusive behaviours like looting multiple arena chests, but that's about it. That's why I'm pushing for few pure layerless servers. That's a realistic option.
---
When half the ‘grievances’ are ‘Don’t play on a streamer server’ - I mean ok then, I won’t?
---
When I watch the best play CS / LoL they make it look easy too!
---
A few deaths here and there? I’m sure you’ll learn it real fast.

Wow, another one of these threads. Yes, two very different branches from the same tree.
---
A N A L [ D I R G E ]
---
No thanks ill take cross server bg over hours long queues and wintrading.
---
It's layers in a very literal sense. Server has multiple layers in them each with their own players.
---
Dream evil - the chosen one https://youtu.be/MM_c_avPlx4
---
Layering how they actually explained it without these janky instances of people phasing out in front of each other. It was promised that would not happen, we kind of expected 1 or 2 people could leave a layer by being invited by a larger group. 
---
Moving 100 people in one hit is way worse than sharding is. It’s jarring, immersion killing and shit design.
---
Retail models look too cartoony
---
Then start acting like the adult you claim to be, use your fucking brain, and think for a second.
---
You make it sound like bam you can just hop layers but it's not that simple at all.
---
Yes.
---
I can stand this awful staged posts anymore...
---
all of wow looks too cartoony. That’s the main point, why the game was preserved so well.
---
That was just some rough estimation from their side. The only definitive answer was that they'll disable sharding in phase 2. So that's the only guarantee we have, other numbers are pure speculation.
---
I, for one, don't believe that it'll exist for the first few weeks on all servers. There will be extremely popular servers which will be overloaded forever. And how they will deal with that is another question. They hope that people magically stop playing to form 3k online? What will they do, when phase 2 arrives and online is 15k?
---
Nah, much rather have a thriving pvp system instead of a constantly dying or dead one
---
Yes leveling is really good, but the question is, how is endgame? Is that good?
---
No personal loot, back to master loot. Expect all kind of ninjas, from loot councils to people doing it on purpose.
---
PvP is not about skill but having an overgeared premade. In a couple of months arathi and wsg will be 24/7 premades raping pugs. Like 6 warriors and 4 healers. Just wait in ghost form at the grave. If you don't want to play in a premade you have to afk at grave till rank 11. Going further is impossible without a group.
---
World mafia, resources for crafting, like devilsaur leather, will be camped 24/7 by gold makers and guilds. Do you want make yourself that set? No way.
---
You think you do, but you don't. People with a life will quit after realizing the time and the frustration involved in a 15 years old game with well known exploits in the system and mechanics.
---
I really suggest you to don't play on streamers servers and on the server from that guy monkeynews which is owning a mafia system to win on private servers.
---
Best answer
---
Oh look, a classic &gt; retail thread, again.
---
probably take me like 3 tries to get it.

im not saying its not bugged but I stopped playing my hunter in vanilla because the commands functioned terribly

Well said

wait, you actually like those goofy ass models lmao? Taurens look like shit in retail

Hey I was here! That was was really fun glad to spend those last moments with ya'll

\-Meso level 12 female orc warrior
---
Finally, some one who gets it. The correlation between # of players and # of layers is extremely volatile based on the geographic distribution of those players and every one is out here acting like it's always and forever at 1.
---
derp
---
Sharding 2.0
---
In the link provided by /u/Vendrex we see that the world is cohesive. You're able to see players inside IF while in Dun Morogh. 
---
In the clip from OP we see that in classic this might not be the case. You can clearly see people appearing all around him as soon as he walks out of IF. This could mean that IF is in it's own shard/layer/instance (we could invent a new term for this, since the three mentioned does not have the same meaning), and walking in and out will cause surroundings to phase in or out. 
---
This will ruin immersion for a lot of people.
---
The ooga clan will probably be doing this.
---
No thanks.  I will take my reduced queue times, and less exploits.  
---
&gt; You can form those things cross server too.
---
 friendships, rivalries
---
I offered facts, you admitted you didn't even know them before someone in this thread told you. You obviously don't have any form of reading comprehension to go along with your garbage social skills. You can't formulate anything to defend your points, and you resort to insults. I also said in one of my responses that layering is good because it will make the game playable at launch. You'd know that if you didn't skim or knew how to comprehend all that reading you claim you do. 
---
The mods need to step in here, you're the worst kind of person and I think you need a time out Jr.
---
As someone who played the original classic, I'm glad the game changed dramatically over the years - often when I come back the thing that keeps me around or pulls me in is a major change (like transmog, or the wardrobe) that makes the game more modern and, honestly, more casual.
---
There are a bunch of things that are great about Classic - the danger of regular mobs, the importance of every item upgrade, the incentive to group and take content more seriously, but you are deluding yourself if you think WoW would have remained the industry leader for 15 years if it didn't change with the times.
---
Storytelling in WoW has gotten better over the years (classic does a lot of world building, but a long continuous narrative wasn't its strength compared to current WoW or even other MMOs). Retail is a lot more accessible than classic - most of us grew up, got jobs, partners, kids, a mortgage and don't have the time to play the game like we did in school. Retail was faced with losing its original audience to changes as they grew up, or adjusting its content to be more accessible to the changing availability of our time.
---
The irony of the whole thing is it's clearly why retail changed the way it did - often many of the frequently cited issues with retail are praised for being that way in classic (like a long, drawn out leveling experience where mobs are dangerous - the stat squish resulted in this and people hated it). It's also the case that retail had to change, because leveling for 60 levels to reach cutting edge content makes sense when 60 is the cap, level for 120 levels to reach cutting edge content was never intended - it's a bloated legacy from 15 years of growth. You can't expect players to spend the same amount of time in the kobold mine near Goldshire in retail that they did in classic - they have mines in Draenor, Northrend, Cataclysm, Pandaria, Draenor again, Broken Isles and Theramore to explore before they can join their friends in current level content. Almost no-one would make it to level 120 if the leveling experience was the same as it was in classic - it had to change to account for a decline in players in leveling zones, to account for a massive time sink to reach level cap, and to account for the changes in how much time people have to play these days.
---
Classic just gets to be Classic. It doesn't have to stretch our progression (without power creep) over 120 levels, or stretch leveling players across seven campaigns of content, most of which have few people playing them (now with and without War Mode). It doesn't have years of inflation, years of materials sinking into the market. It is easier for Classic to be Classic.
---
I'm excited about Classic. I'm glad it exists and I'm glad people are going to enjoy it, but I'm realistic about why retail is the way it is. BfA might not be the best expansion WoW ever had, but Legion had many of the same systems as BfA and was incredibly popular. Retail is a very good game, and BfA might be a rough spot, the game is overall better suited for what it needs to be in 2019 than if it had kept most things the same as they were in Classic.
---
I'm glad Blizzard is offering us the chance to enjoy both. I'll try out Classic for the nostalgia fix but I don't think I'll be one of the ones sticking it out longterm. I just don't have time for that in my life.
---
Go try to dig up actual sources on vanilla dps breakdowns. I’ll bet this https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/687011-Vanilla-Raid-DPS is as close as you come, and that’s not a breakdown. Asking for sources that don’t exist is silly. Particularly when it’s clear that one party in the discussion has no idea what they’re talking about. 
---
His statement roughly matches what I recall seeing, and his statements about crits are clearly obvious from any knowledge of how the mechanic functions in any game that has them. The other guy’s statements about crits are pure silliness - to the point where they really shouldn’t need that even mentioned.
---
It doesn’t look like anyone actually preserved their logs from that time period. If you can find otherwise, I’m very interested.
---
Thanks friend.
---
Vanilla looks the right amount of cartoony though
---
There is this fricking guy called perplexity
---
Are they not removing this shortly after launch? There is an incrediby small group of people that will take advantage of this. And before anything of importance happens at 60 the system is gone. I'd still have it over not being able to quest in Durotar/Barrens/next zone.
---
How does it look in SW?
---
That would be so funny and immensely depressing at the same time.
---
If you are torn about it, do.
---
See, our sentences do not add much value right now. You’re OP’s reasoning makes both side’s points equally.
---
You are investing a lot of time. Perhaps don’t pick a race you might regret hundreds of hours down the line. Because - like it or not - some racials are huge and game changing.
---
If you make an informed decision to RP, adequately understanding what you are missing, go for it. If you don’t then better inform yourself.

Night Elf female what? My guess would be druid.

Im going human male warrior. Maybe dwarf male warrior for obvious reasons.

And to those who're saying that retail players don't care about Classic enough to complain about it? you're wrong in my experience as a retail WoW player who is still subbed and playing, whenever we (I or somebody else) mentions ANYTHING to do with Classic in general chat or trade chat, or to individual players in whisper, or to groups in party or raid chat, there are usually always passive-aggressive responses shitting on Classic straight away with the usual "It will be dead in a month." "Fuck Classic." "It's out-dated, I played once and won't touch it again."
---
Its cause your better then everyone else.
---
&gt; On this tech site that I frequent they have a system that when a member abuses the voting system, they get a warning from the moderator. When said member continues the abuse, that member gets his voting privilege taken away. It's not perfect, no voting system is, but it's the least worst I've seen.
---
We can't implement that at all. We can't withdraw someone's ability to vote, nor can we see who votes how.
---
&gt;Are there specific points in his talent tree you disagree with?
---
Not him, but:
---
&gt;Because seal fate build was highly viable in both pve and pvp
---
It wasn't, seal fate is really bad until you get high crit, it starts to be "viable" on AQ+ patch.
---
Hes losing DPS by not having PvE talents from the combat tree, and also not having the mix of PvP talents from sub.
---
Haha funny MEME, DUDE
---
Ironfoe? Gressil?
---
Nah I'd rather keep annoying overly sensitive nost babies
---
&gt;I mean layering/phasing has already jumped from "just for launch" to "until phase 2 at the latest".
---
It actually jumped from "never at all"

&gt;"One of the tenets of Classic WoW is none of the cross-server realms and different [server] sharding options that we have available to us today.
---
a slim chance at a 0.5% upgrade and even if it drops it may not drop for you it may drop for someone that it's not an upgrade for but due to being a higher ilevel means they cant trade it
---
Must... Max... Out... Ap...
---
Kind of funny and ironic, you can switch classic and bfa here and still be 100% correct.
---
People can like other games
---
&gt; 90% of Vanilla battlegrounds were fought against only other people in your server.
---
Except they weren't.
---
Battlegrounds were released on 7 June 2005.
---
Cross-realm BGs came out 22 August 2006.
---
TBC came out 16 January 2007.
---
If the same number of BGs were played every single day, that's at best 75% of BGs without cross-realm battlegrounds, but we know that's far from the truth. Some realms barely got one AV match a week. 
---
It's much closer to 50%.
---
We have exactly the same mouse keyboard and headset..
---
Edited, ty. And swapping the humans gender around might be something too.
---
I realize it's not your job, but the link is no longer available to download
---
&gt; Because you actually had to talk to people to get a group?
---
"LF DPS deadmines" is not "talking to people"
---
Leveling in Path of Exile has become more smooth due to earlier options for skills but once you finish the story mode tutorial it's just as challenging as it's felt for a few years now. I've yet to progress to the big endgame stuff despite playing every league since Abyss.
---
Retail WoW is for Tide-pod eaters   
---
Simple as that
---
Why does anyone become friends with anyone IRL then, if there are "other people out there"?
---
You're being absurd.
---
I remember players phasing in randomly in vanilla all the time. And you end up saying that this "could be" sharding/layering/instancing, which are all completely different things. It's clear you don't have enough information to even relate this clip with layering in classic, let alone use it as a gotcha against "layering apologists"
---
Even without looking at wow, every game that claims to be difficult at some point but if you have to shoot yourself three times in the foot to reach that point has a terrible design on difficulty.
---
OP's clip is sharding, IF is its own "instance", while 2006 footage show that was not the case back then.
---
I swear, 99.9% of the people whining about layering has no clue how it works.
---
Wow, can you chill? You're having a mental breakdown over this. Of course seeing layering work in an unusual ideal situation is wildly different than someone explaining how it should work. Calling people fucking stupid over it is not cool, and this toxic behavior shouldn't be tolerated.
---
Classic good, retail bad! Ooga booga, nochanges
---
Call me weird but I’m roll female human arms warrior. Best armor and animations in the game in my opinion
---
i think the majority of the current player base will play it as something to do between raids, some will go onto it hard core but i dont think we will see the mass exodus that some people seem to think will happen with the mentality of "classic is going to kill retail" fist off classic wont kill retail as all blizz is worried about is that sub number not what version you are playing as its all the same to them secondly if it did some how cause a mass exodus from retail i think it would end up doing more harm than good to the overall game
---
please enlighten me how layering solves overcrowding?
---
this shit is pretty easy to understand but too hard for your pea brain apparently.
---
Same here. I've been subbed on &amp; off since late TBC and the last time I can recall having so much fun on WoW was in WotLK, Wintergrasp on my heavily Alliance-dominant PvE realm as Horde with tenacity buff stacks to one shot players lol. While that experience isn't Classic (since I never got to play Vanilla) just being a scrubby lvl 1 on the Stress Test is so much fun even without the streamers on organising events.
---
I'm glad you understand. You think you do, but now you do.
---
very cool, pajit
---
Entered another zone. Layering is more aggressive than we've been lead to believe.

i’m basing my “opinion” on playing online games in the US and EU for the past 20 years on english-language servers. the culture between US and EU is vastly different and the US servers (in literally all games) are far far far more social (and obnoxious) - my guess for this obvious difference is rooted in the fact that scandinavians represent a large piece of players on the EU servers and scandinavians are in no way shape or form as social (which has become a political issue in recent times with immigrants failing to adapt to the “introvert” culture).
---
now if you want to talk about germans or russian or spanish or italian, i wouldn’t have a clue how they compare to americans because i cannot engage with players who actively refuse to communicate with me, mostly due to their unwillingness to speak the most used language around the globe: english.
---
RES works fine for me. Running ublock origin as well, but I think I get everything that is supposed to be there (it does look like the old forums). If I remember I’ll try disabling it tomorrow. I have ... an unreasonable number of tabs (lets say high two / low three digit and not ask for a count) running as well, so it’s unlikely to be tied to that. 
---
What browser and other extensions/addons do you have running?
---
For the same reason you add friends after finding someone in chat. That's literally a perfect parallel to IRL.
---
If there are four layers, there's four times the population as normal. Instead of ten nolifers farming at 60 with little competition, there'll be fourty nolifers farming at 60. This is not a problem, the economy will be absolutely fine.
---
&gt; How it was possible to start with such a great game, and end up here like this?
---
By making change after change "for convenience" or  to make X " more fun", and forgetting that every change comes with unintended consequences.
---
Take retail dungeons for example: It was deemed unfun (by players as much as devs) to manually make groups. Common complaints were the time it took to build the group, and the time it took to travel to the dungeon. With time, a subset of players also didn't find groups at all any more (usually because they had earned a Reputation on their server), which also was deemed risky by devs - players that don't have things to do quit the game.
---
So they put in an automated system that took over all those unfun things: It automatically grouped people up and transported them to the dungeon. But since those players never even had talked to each other, they could not be trusted to have the necessary amount of teamwork and team spirit to master a moderately challenging dungeon - so the dungeons were toned down so even groups that did not communicate *at all* could run them, and run them well - because with no time and effort invested in the group, people tended to leave at the drop of a hat.
---
...Of course, now you have taken other things out of the equation as well: Manually seeking players means *engaging* with those those players, having conversations. Manually traveling to a dungeon means time for socializing (including bitching about how far the dungeon is - as we say, shared pain is halved pain, and sharing/suffering such inconveniences creates a bond between players), and being out in the game world, mentally engaging with it: People tended to learn where a dungeon was - it had a connection to the world and its lore. 
---
All that time and effort invested by all players means that now everyone is furthermore invested in the dungeon. Which means everyone is more ready to stick and work together, and Be A Team (just like you were in RFC). And when you succeed, and that feels like actually having gone on an adventure, having overcome the odds, and leaving with shiny loot to boot - shiny loot that now *means* something. And the players you fought with now are battle brothers and sister, and you have shared experiences, and you will remember their names. Not every one of those will land on your friend list, but the shared world means that you likely will cross each other's paths again at the very least - another thing that was largely patched out in favour of convenience (sharding, CRZ, server-hopping).
---
There is a reason "the road to hell is paved with good intentions" is an adage; I am sure that every change between Vanilla and Retail were well intended, just as the people now clamoring for things to be different surely are well-intended. but as we've seen, the road of good intentions led to Retail.
---
Oh yeah that. Kinda agreed. I'm more preoccupied by the EU servers, personally.
---
I like Westfall so much. And Duskwood. Even Elwyn! But I want to go horde :( And I will miss these zones so much!

Would solve  All issues except that it let you get away from Ganks in inn (happens from time to time that rouge kills anyone who spawns there.)

No, they don't.
---
Also ur rogue spec is trash tier for both pvp and pve, seal fate seriously? lmao
---
I don't think so, I remember this stuff happening on retail long before sharding was a thing.  I actually remember it happening at this specific point too because I liked to duel and outside IF right here was always a good place to find people to duel.
---
lmao look at this fucking guy thinking he has a clue. Youre American i assume
---
&gt; a current game that is in falling down a actual similar trap is path of exile
---
Oh guys Tencent money totally wont influence us at all don't worry /s
---
That I forget to do basic stuff in dungeons and I can't pvp whatsoever. Basically I'll be a burden on society.
---
&gt; The irony of doing this with a Velf model
---
Well, that's the template we have so far.
---
People will be more spread about the world after a while. When Classic launches, everyone will be in the starting zones and so on. It will be VERY busy in those areas. Layering is there to help with the initial burst of players in the same zones.
---
Chrome is a great browser but it runs like shit on my machine. Total memory hog and I have no idea why. I'm no tech wiz, but I know enough to clear my cache and it just doesn't matter; chrome is so slow, but firefox has no issues for me. I prefer chrome's layout but not enough to deal with whatever issue I seem to have with it. Not blaming chrome; it could be something I just haven't figured out, but I swear I've gone down the rabbit hole trying to get it to behave like an internet browser when it comes to resources and I just couldn't solve the issue.
---
I wish my cats would play with me
---
I'm a bit confused here, when you create a new group you are moved to a new layer, but does this mean that when in group you can't see anyone else but the group, or you can interact with other randomly selected layers or something?
---
"How it was possible to start with such a great game, and end up here like this?" -OP
---
Building the game for mass appeal and maximizing profits.
---
Many years ago, games were built for gamers. They were difficult adventures with rewarding experiences and one could sick hundreds of hours into them and not run out of stuff to do.
---
Today, games are built for consumers. Players are meant to login and get their daily dopamine fix and log off. Games aren't built for longevity because self-emergent gameplay doesn't generate profits.
---
Sure, but I want to be able to play the game without (much)problem, it's the product I paid for.
---
I think the issue to me after playing since 2004 is how Ion speaks about the devs.  I keep hearing Ion always say things like we do x because we want more people to experience what the devs create ie pathfinder for flying.  LFR was added so more people would see raid content. Or creating expansion specific systems ie artifacts(which were awesome), garrisons, heart of azeroth that simply get discarded at the end of an expansion cycle. That's cool,  I'm not gonna s*** on the devs completely.  But it takes away from the world when they  approach the game in that manner.   What I'm trying to say is that we dont play the game for the devs theme park specifically but, rather we play it for the experience of a living breathing world that evolves on itself.
---
I personally like the old icons for the current flairs and /r/wow can keep their cleaner, more modern icons to fit retail WoW's polished graphics.

I don't ever recall having seen anything like what happens in the clip during vanilla. However I've seen it happen many times in retail wow after sharding was implemented. What happens in this clip is obviously an implementation or extension of that technology, and even if you don't have any issues with the technology I sincerely hope you agree that this is what's happening in the clip. OP literally says in this thread that moving in and out of IF causes people to phase in and out. That didn't happen in vanilla.

&gt;And I can also get my rp on in my head as I play
---
This right here is what ruined tbc for me and also why I love vanilla wow! I can actually feel like someone struggling through the world which has rich ties to WC3 lore!
---
I've seen this with quite a few NPCs
---
Yup, but I think Blizzard realized it (making some dungeons Mythic-only in Legion, admitting flying was a mistake in WoD) but they’re just in too deep. You can’t make people accustomed to accessibility and then take it away (look at the response to difficult heroics in Cataclysm)
---
Skewed sample set. If you ask currently subscribed people, only current subs will respond. Try on a forum where you can verify if someone currently plays or not. Doing so on a reasonably large forum, I’ve seen more responses from people who aren’t currently subbed than who are, regardless of the content of those. The only people worried about the sky falling on current are a tiny fraction of current subs. The people who think vanilla will drop subs within a few months are about half the folks who played vanilla, regardless of current status.
---
Your acting like its hard to communicate cross faction / server in 2019.. see a premade, look up the guild discord - BAM your in.
---
Yeah all stoners think that they are playing the same way when they are not high
---
I'm with this guy. 
---
Battlegrounds are going to last awhile. We've already seen on streams that some of them can go on for hours. All they need to do is work on allowing a greater number of multiple BGs within a single server.
---
If that's the case, people queing will either have to wait for enough people in que to start another battleground, or wait for someone to leave and replace them. 
---
There will no doubt be tons of players looking to PvP. There never was a shortage. Even when you had to run all the way to the portal just to que, there were tons of people there. 
---
I don't remember people complaining about the wait times back in Vanilla... all the fuss is coming from the comfortability cross server PvP brought.
---
Its not because of layering, its because the whole realm is empty. Currently peaking around ~200 players per faction concurrently online.
---
Ohhh ur choosing music from around that era. How do you feel about st anger by metallica lol. I love that album tbh. Personally I just have one massive metallica playlist with all their songs on it, I have a pretty big rammstein and megadeth playlist as well. I'll probably just cycle through those, but I might just stick to the ingame soundtrack.
---
its kind of been the opposite for me. Albeit, I've stripped my goals in current down. No longer doing Mythic or high M+ . Classic has been a reminder that I still have genuine interest in the game even if I don't enjoy the current content structures and gameplay systems. 
---
I'm glad there will be both. I'll likely spend more time in Classic over the next year but my interest in retail will still be there because of it.
---
Welcome to the same boat as the rest of us; where we are all waiting for classic and no other game scratches the itch.
---
Many of us log-in or resub to retail, only to realize that the game isn't what it was in classic.
---
I know what you mean, been playing on a private server for a few weeks now and while I was leveling I remember pulling an extra two mobs and I just relized I was dead. I also needed breaks for mana and grouping up with people etc. Really fun experince then I went back to retail and thought I'd continue to level my druid and I could just be watching Youtube and not really worry about what happend with my health and mana since I'd survive anyway.
---
Difference to me is how automated everything feels, no one really talk in the world when I try (a few have and made some good friends that way though) and it feels like just npc's run around and you won't ever see them again. I enjoy max level content still, Been enjoying pvp and gonna try to get into raiding in 8.2 if I enjoy myself enough but differance is crazy.
---
What facts did you offer?  Are you referring to a different post chain?  I’m actually confused,  That longer post I initially responded to was full of irrelevant and emotional insults.  Your response to me was totally emotional, non-objective, and didn’t contribute to the discussion at all.  To be honest, too, lots of your word choices just didn’t make sense.  
---
I couldn’t care less what type of person you think I am because you’re just wrong and your reading comprehension blows.  I don’t respect you and therefore don’t care about your opinion.  
---
I acknowledge that I’ve been abrasive because I haven’t tried to make you feel good about acting like an idiot.  Honestly your best play is to either say “ok fair point, sorry- here’s what I meant” or to say “you said the word retard which triggered me so yeah sorry the other stuff i said wasn’t objective” or just to shit your mouth, because you’re being at least as big of an asshole as I am, perhaps more (revisit your emotionally triggered post).  
---
I invite you to report this post to the mods if you’re so inclined.  I also invite you to consider how you may have escalated this discussion.
---
Man reading your post revives the feelings when I first started playing the game. On Ally side it was dungeons instance. Wipes were unlimited. IMO if the game is too auto pilot it becomes boring. I played on and off after BC and wrath. It started to get easy, too easy. What is fun in playing a game which is geared towards making you feel like you did 50 instances in brief period of time. Rinse and report. Na, original wow, BC, and to an extent Wrath had it all. You had to be social, talk to people and make friends within your guild and outside. You had to know what you were playing. You had to improvise. As the game progressed it lost all of it. So you are right, game is not what it used to be and what it was, was an epic experience. You had to earn it and that was the game. 
---
Even played Legion for a bit but it wasn’t same. I’m looking forward for August launch.
---
Ya man i know how you feel. This latest news about the servers really killed my hype a small bit. I will still play the hell out of it, but im now worried about finding out one day that im on the unofficial server for a language i dont speak.
---
NE Male Druid and NE Female Hunter for lore reasons.
---
being unsatisfied with models is not the same thing as saying that objectively they are of a better quality. i advocate for the latter
---
There's a better option to all of these: Remove the ability to easily and reliably abuse Layering.
---
Let's say Character A is logged in and on Layer 2:
---
1. If Character A logs out or quits the game, upon returning, they will be placed in Layer 2.
---
2. If an Alt of Character A logs in, they will be placed in Layer 2 no matter what Layer they were in before.
---
3. If Character A joins a group with a character in a city or on a flightpath, that group member always gets pulled to Layer 2, never the other way around.
---
4. If Character A joins a group with a character drastically lower level, that group member always gets pulled to Layer 2, never the other way around.
---
5. If Character A is engaged in any sort of combat, temporarily suspend Layer swapping for any and all party members until the combat is finished.
---
6. When 3 &amp; 4 are not available, the group members that get Layered or don't, will be completely random at first. Once the decision is made, leaving the group and rejoining always forces the same decision.
---
7. Always force guild members and friends on the same Layer upon logging in, otherwise ignore these changes.
---

You guys really say headshot like that? I have grown up with just spelling out HS. Seems easier and doesn't sound as cringy.
---
Are we sure druids are affected by this, when their weapon speed doesn't matter? It might be other things that makes it easier instead of this specific bug.
---
Suggestion: Players have to be in the same zone to layer hop.
---
Just trying to get all the layer discussion in one thread, more about cleaning up the spam than anything else.
---
I don’t even care about raiding in Classic, that’s never why I played WoW
---
Don’t worry, no one is going to bother stream sniping you.
---
For some people it definitely seems like it's about hate lol, I understand the situation completely however. As an American looking in on the situation and seeing all the shit-flinging I still find it pretty funny, though. 
---
Sounds like a money thing to me. They don't wanna pay to support servers for different server types for each language when they know the population will most likely dip at some point. Then again who really knows.
---
Oh, well that solves the whole issue. This should be higher up
---
If you look at the whole video, you will see that he did in fact switch layers. You will see that most of the mobs in the area were dead before he switched layers, and after he was invited to the group the mobs were suddenly all alive. Take a look yourself.
---
You don't buy reagents in Thunder Bluff, and it's still only 10%. Rep is basically a meme that everyone ignores except RPers and completionists. IIRC you start up with the discount of your respective capital city, or start very close to obtaining the discount, you also get a lot of rep doing starting quests and probably gain it before you can begin aoe pulls.
---
Oh, I weren't trying to present an elaborate sample or anything here, you know? I was simply sharing my personal experience from when I was casually playing BFA over the space of weeks from the Classic Beta hype and such, and asked friends, random players I got talking to, and engaging in discussions in general chat and trade chat. You're right though, of course you'll get seemingly more players hating on Classic from current subs ON retail WoW, however I do see a lot of positivity surrounding Classic elsewhere, which is to be expected. Well, everywhere except the Classic WoW forum discussion right now on EU. It's a mess with the nationalities being merged.

I did rank 11 on Nostalrius. Facts.

they do kill relatively slowly until the 40s. They rarely die though.

I dueled a lot outside IF and remember having to walk out all the way (sometimes, not always) to see if there were any people outside dueling.

Anything by Linkin Patk

Ok let's say you are right. That means you have proven that there is sharding in classic, because this just isn't how layering works. If that's the case, then why are you talking about layering apologists? If that's the case, then this is an entirely different issue. "Layering apologists" aren't defending sharding, because sharding isn't supposed to be in classic. So why are you talking about them?
---
I can certainly respect that and the effort you made in this post.
---
Yup. And 200ms minimum if you're from a southernmost country like Argentina or Uruguay
---
I agree. I think people need to just stop telling other people what they should find fun.
---
You're a colossal douche and you're antagonizing so many people you can't even keep it all straight.
---
Grind.
---
Or doing it on the easiest difficulty for that small chance of making the drop magically turn into a drop from the hardest difficulty
---
Then join a guild and get over it.
---
You should absolutely stay away from classic and those toxic private server Chads for your own well-being.
---
You imbecile.
---
I think it's a stupid idea. It's just gonna end up being a server half full of Germans and half of people who wished they'd rolled on another server.
---
Nostalrius was Chinese paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to staff to close an eye on their r14 account selling business. When players found out about it and made it public, then Blizzard got involved.
---
And 20k players is in no way conducive to better community than 3.5k.

As much as I don't like how kids basically only play multiplayer shooter games now instead of more varied experiences like a lot of older single player games I played when I grew up (RPGs, RTSs, platformers, puzzle games, etc.) I'm not a fan of this type of mentality. The most important thing IMO, especially now that playing games is so common, is that they are able to grow up playing the same stuff the people in their age group play and are interested in.
---
It's fine if they choose to not play those games and instead play older ones but I really don't like the mentality of "they need to play these games before I'll let them play newer ones." To me, doing that seems like the fast track toward making your kid feel really out of place among his peers and making it harder to fit in / make friends. 
---
And honestly, this is one of those things that in a way is as old as human history itself. Every generation thinks the next generation is growing up with the wrong books / movies / TV shows / music and the "right stuff" to grow up with was the stuff you grew up with, now you can add games to that list. I would've hated if my parents tried to force all the old stuff they liked as a kid on me, the few times they did it just made me resent whatever it was because it was being forced on me and was completely out of touch with my generation.
---
this is the worst rogue spec ive seen and im been playing this class before you were born
---
the pvp reasoning sounds logical to me. Not sure about the dungeons, because based on what everyone says on forums, raids took 1 spriest max per 40-man raid. There is a stigma against pve endgame spriests which would dissuade people from rolling this class. For leveling, they can heal dungeons as shadow yeah
---
This only affects instant special attacks with weapons, druid should remain unchanged unless there is a different druid bug.
---
This is a perfect example of why idiots should stop spewing “blizzard has the correct numbers and you dont” rubbish.

Megathreads are great for some topics and not so great for others. Streamers and layering, mostly due to the nature of the discussion, being two things they won't support well. I'm mostly speaking for myself, but here goes:
---
Megathreads tend to be great for moments of excitement, when the community is all reacting to the exact same piece of news, and when the news won't update. Instead of dozens of threads popping off with single-sentence content all of those threads get removed and redirected into the megathread. Which is why we've used them for things like the stress test in the past, Blizzcon, and so on. 
---
Another thing they tend to do is lead the discussion. The less popular opinion gets buried far more quickly, and the more popular opinion looks like overwhelming consensus. For this reason alone we don't want to use a megathread for topics where there are a lot of varied opinions (layering and streamers being just that). They're also not great for reflecting updates to that news, because you can't change the title, you can't wipe away the previous discussion (without removing it - which we don't want to do), and so on. 
---
Finally, we have 2 stickies. We had to get rid of the bug report sticky to sticky this, and still maintain our weekly posts which from previous feedback were widely appreciated (and in the case of LFG and WSIP overwhelmingly necessary).
---
Instead of using a megathread we're simply removing nearly all single sentence posts, and directing people to post comment-length posts in the body of a relevant post, as there is always a fresh layering/streamer thread every single day, if not several.
---
There is no "eu" culture though, so your opinion you have formed is flawed. Eu consist of tens of different cultures, were most have no issues socializing with randoms.
---
And Scandinavians are hardly any majority in a big game. And certainly not a region in europe you can use as a base for "eu" culture. As even between mus Nordic countries we are different.
---
And even more so when compared to Central Europe.
---
As a Swedish guy I do enjoy the meme about how we are recluses, or like our personal space, but thosr are just memes. In reality most of have no issue talking to strangers if we want to.
---
Slightly biased in that it only takes into account lvl 40, which doesn't show choices as much as fastest leveling speeds + choices, could be 4 times the number of druids as mages but if they leveled slowly on avg and were only 39 you wouldn't know it.
---
Gooble Gobble Gooble Gobble.

God damn that movie was scary as a kid.
---

---
I'm so glad I was here to witness this.
---
What about feral attacks?
---
You should have understood that instantly from overwatch. But I disagree in relation to this setup.
---
This kind of opinion is so short-sighted its almost worthless. Yes, layering is for the casuals and not the no-lifers. But you can be sure the no-lifers are going to pull every single advantage they can from layering. And so while layering might save the launch experience for a casual, it has a high risk of also really messing with the (in my opinion, far more important) long-term health of the server, and therefore the long-term enjoyment of that casual player. If layering is left in any more than two weeks, there will absolutely be a few realms that end up becoming like mafias or cartels run by guilds that managed to snowball super hard after farming like crazy with layering. 
---
Imagine being a casual player on a server like that. You can't effectively farm gold because all of the best spots are on 24/7 farm by that guild or people they can pay to do it, and everything on the AH is inflated so you can't buy anything. You're behind the curve in terms of gear so getting into groups is hard. You can't farm epic world drops or rares either for the same reason as above. So unless you got a lucky world drop while leveling you are basically screwed with no way out. At that point who cares if it took you only half the time to kill kobolds in Northshire this time as it did in 2004? You hate your server, you hate your character, you want to switch servers but leveling again is such a grind and layerings gone now so you can easy boost a mage. Does that sound worth it to you? Because it's a possible outcome whatever you may think.
---
At the end you would heart out
---
So people who were telling the damage on a beta realm was off were right, despite ActiBlizzard's drones constantly shitting on them and making fun of them "LuL PrIVaTE sErVErS cRoWd".
---
Tbh I was only 6 in 2006 so I don't have many memories, but I'll mainly be listening to metallica and rammstein. Most of metallicas music is slightly nostalgic for me, even there newer stuff.
---
Whether I’m a douche is irrelevant to what you were previously saying, so my best guess is that I said something that offended you so you lashed out.  I’ll even concede that I’m a douche because it doesn’t matter to me and isn’t relevant.  
---
I invite you to demonstrate what I am failing to keep straight, but honestly that’s just a huge waste of time.
---
It only took one expansion for players to forget how to mark priority targets.
---
Lich King.
---
That would be impossible.
---
And this is definitely a worse spec: https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/12312102-1151501011-512030132132
---
That's where we're at now? Just throwing the word "megathread" into thread titles without actually being a mod, just for a little bit more attention?
---
Great sub guys.
---
Ah I get your point now. You’re right that sharding and layering is not the same thing, but it seems to me that the people who are in favor of layering has no issues with stuff like this, but I could be wrong of course. I could’ve worded it differently, I agree with you.
---
That makes no sense. Benelux and UK has almost nothing culturally in common with the Nordic countries.
---
There shiuld be a Nordic realm though, for only Iceland, Denmark, Greenland, Sweden, Finland, and Norway.
---
I'm not taking anyone using private servers as their argument seriously. You cannot relate the private server playerbase to the playerbase of retail wow. Whatever you may think.
---
This is not layering, this is straight up Sharding. IF is its own instance in OPs clip.
---
What you are remembering is old hardware/engine where people some players pop in and out due to server load or view distance. But nothing like OPs clip. This is sharding straight from retail where this happens everytime when you enter/leave a city.
---
That's a funny argument, especially when that's not gonna be happening :) good times
---
Wow has been a constant thing in my life for 12 years now, but I've never played properly during vanilla. I played on my friends account and leveled his mage through arathi for him. After playing the demo and the first two stress tests I just don't feel like logging in on my retail account anymore. While, I hope for TBC servers (nostalgia aside, as a druid player, TBC feels like it really fleshed out the druid class in areas they were lacking in Vanilla. One of the reasons I'm skeptical of rolling druid on classic, but that's a whole other topic), I'm still excited to experience classic and August can't come soon enough. If anything, I hope classic inspires the retail team to take a step back and fix their game, make it feel like a game again rather than a check list of activities with random rewards.
---
Be quiet you arse.
---
they really aren't, though. Look at the realm population. Most of them are at middle. Most of them are still somewhere at 500-1000 players, which isn't a full server obviously, but far from a ghost town.
---
Depends if you were questing in the area or not.  You could run out and continue questing.
---
If you're on a PvE server for some stupid reason it sucks. This is where you'll find all the Dwarf Priests and Human Warriors. On the real servers tho? It's game breaking. How amazing is it to have a permanent stealth on a non-stealth class. Even if you can't move its still amazing for escaping/ambushing.
---
Throw in AGM, devilsaur leather, a couple of the most popular black lotus/thorium spots and a large guild (or coalition) could easily take over an entire server if they snowball properly.
---
Classic is only like 5 or 6gigabytes. Retail is past 20gb. Also I tried retail after playing the stress test and I got bored. Not many people, I don't like the new models, the new UI, the new abilties, the new talent tree, and it looks like they simplified the stats on armour and weapons. Leveling is too easy, I didn't play dungeons this time but they were super easy last year when I subbed. All my old characters I invested so much time into, but I'm not interested with playing them because blizzard ruined the game.
---
Ahem... Mana problems? With Life Tap? I agree on +hit though. This is a problem. But +15% from spriest debuff is really big. Anyway, we'll see.
---
Not untrue but a bit of an extreme. I do however think, as mentioned before, that large community's that mainly talk xyz language will be detrimental for others on the same realm that dont speak said languages.
---
I think saying people wont play because of this is a bit over the top, but it will be a lesser experience for bóth sides.
---
If you’re on my server and I end up being a higher level than you (or even just the same) I’ve got your back homie. 
---
-a hunter trying to make friends with warriors so I get brought to dungeons and raids
---
I know LFR gets a lot of hate around here but I feel like it can't be inherently bad. It must be flaws in the way bilzzard implemented it. Having people sit around and spam LFG/LFM in general chat isn't great. It seems like the things they got wrong was making it so that the group/dungeon/etc is so disposable.
---
Making it so you can continue to do quests while in the queue seems nice but it has the side effect that you don't need to be near the dungeon so they added the teleport thing. I think that feature is a mistake. Making it so you play with people on other servers makes it all feel very anonymous. Devaluing the play interaction portion.
---
I don't think EverQuest had an auction house. I'm pretty sure you just had to stand around using chat commands spamming WTS. So when WoW came out and had a builtin AH, that was nice. And I don't think it made the game worse in any way. (I could be wrong, I didn't play that much EQ). So it seems like automating group finding could work in a way that doesn't ruin the game so much. 
---
At least, I'd like to believe that is the case.
---
RemindMe! 6 months LMAO
---
Tell him to role Warrior and give him the “at least then your useful to me” comment :P
---
I was goona say, I remember hunters launching half finished, this just sounds like blizzard going above and beyond for recreating the authentic experience.
---
Blizz backing away from actually difficult HCs is what made TotalBiscuit quit WoW. And he was one of the biggest WoW youtubers at the time. Too bad blizz are so stubborn and learn all the wrong lessons.
---
You are the type that was making fun of people who were telling beta felt off in terms of damage numbers. Shitty ActiBlizz fanboy drone.
---
I mean, there is no requirement that you have to be a mod create it. If you don't think ones needed that's one thing, but I haven't seen one created yet so I figured I'd try.
---
It always is. It was too late for Azerite and it IS (that one hurt haha) too late for shamans.
---
Roleplaying game games?
---
No they're not but they are a part of the world wide web which has a majority of English speaking. I'm not saying they *have" to speak English, I'm saying it doesn't really matter. 
---
I'm glad you had a good time with those guys but when I play late I end up playing with Turkish, Russian ... I mean anyone but English and I enjoy my experiences with them. I don't see a single issue doing this on WoW I find it poor behaviour to put up a wall without an ounce of experience. 
---
The worst argument against what I'm saying is those mentioning private servers. That should show you how little anyone knows about what's coming and so we should sit firm and see what it's like.
---
I miss TB so much, I used to listen to WoW-Radio while leveling. 
---
Also THAT RETARDED HORSE
---
I don't care personnaly because I speak english i'm just explaining why this is a problem for many people.
---
Yea, while they deserve praise for being communicative on the OP topic and others, I've noticed that they really only communicate after they've found a solution or made a decision.  The lack of communication on leeway makes me think either they are still debating on the correct solution or the correct solution might be technologically challenging or slow to implement.
---
Yeah, for me classic is much more about the journey. Although I'd love to see Rag for the first time or experience old naxx
---
Will that let you show the information for multiple abilities? I recall it only letting you do one.
---
Stress test, not beta.
---
Here, take my two cents , real money transaction &gt; abusable bad temporary system.
---
I'd settle for an official blue post specifying a singular date that layering will be removed from classic. A lot of the layering panic comes from a fear that it won't be temporary, and the fact that blizzard keeps hedging their bets and giving half answers that actually say very little.
---
I work in a hospital.
---
If you're that against grouping with people who aren't English, don't do it. The choice is yours, it's toxic to say it isn't and that because you speak English you should be separated. 
---
None of us can say what it's really going to be like until it happens, and if you look at some more replies I've got, many *are* toxic.
---
You utter mess of a human.
---
Is this a crossover episode?
---
P.s does this mean people who enjoy BFA are wow-equivalent keepers?
---
At least the specific example mentioned seems to work. https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c3b97c/with_10_buttons_or_less_your_macros_can_access/erqgc3w/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
No promises on anything else.
---
Wow nice name calling my dude.
---
Trust me, it's a nice experience. Those replying to me with some kinda boundary against other speaking languages are just vile people who refuse to accept there's a world out there that isn't English lol. 
---
Everytime, even in extremely toxic central games, I've still had amazing times with those who cannot speak English.
---
Yeah I miss him too :c I never listened to wow radio because I started watching him during the cata beta, as I guess most people did. But I've been watching his content ever since. May he rest in peace.
---
nah Sheeps are in fact diabolical creatures. It is said that Cthuns complete body resembles that of a sheep, what we see in AQ is only the eye and its stomach worms.
---
I think it's sad you have to add the disclaimer, people take offense way to easy now a days and can't understand a joke. like banter between horde and alliance players on this sub seems to be frowned upon but its one of the greatest things about wow I think. no other game has the same type of faction system I feel, Noone has done it aswell atleast
---
I completely agree with what you said about retail Wow.
---
I also got hooked into WoW a few weeks after vanilla release and was full on it like a meth addict, had a blast of a time made tons of new friends and everything you mentioned above, it was glorious.
---
Everything was fine up until Wotlk. After that the new expansions didn't feel like rewarding or challenging for me, so for myself I just tuned a few weeks into new expansions and quit after a while.
---
To extend what you said about Classic ruining retail for you, WoW in itself in all honesty ruined EVERY other game in this specific Gametype for me(excluding shooters that's a different kind of story).
---
But nearly every other mmo off or online is just like meh, tastes like heated up 3 day old food.
---
It just isn't the same, I can't force myself into enjoying new games and stay tuned on them.
---
Atm I'm playing Elderscrolls Online to bridge the time till classic release and man I can tell you it's hard for me to play it for more than 1 hour. Everything feels so overfilled with information and no real structure and insight. Also gearing in this game is like gearing in retail wow dungeons, you just get set by set by set, till you hit max level.
---
Also NOTHING is really challenging. You can pull as much mobs as you want, if you aren't full handicapped you will manage to get you through the fight pretty easy.
---
Pretty sure that PS2 was out by the time WOW debuted.

The beta is there TO TEST ALL FEATURES. Layering is one of them. They NEED to have it turned on ffs.

I mean he's been playing it for a long time, just because he switches to  a different version of the game doesn't mean he stopped playing for that reason. I watched the whole youtube video, he got kills, everyone makes mistakes sometimes. Honestly 90% of all player bases of all games are dog shit. Classic wow  leveling isn't even difficult compared to the vanilla p servers lol. After playing the stress test server to level 15 and doing 5 hrs of pvp, i switched to league, and apex for a bit because i was bored. Not everyone likes sticking with the same game all the time. He doesn't care  to be the best from what I've seen from one of his rants about all the elitist losers. IMO out of all the communities I dislike Wow community, At least league is toxic because you fucked up. Most wow players just bull shit to feel good about themselves. I was saying the leveling in classic was a bit easier than a p server. ( could kill level 4 spiders as level 1 can't do that in a p server) everyone and their mom suddenly played p server disagreed. It's not logical. So I wouldn't hate on this guy, he's not used to that type of community, probably wanted a break and just played retail where ppl wouldn't bash em for doing w.e. the fuck he wants. If he dueled people all day for about 3 days, tried to work what he did wrong in duels, I'm sure he would have most things down pat to be decent in pvp and learn from there. I'm not sure why you need to inflate your ego so much. IMO wow pvp isn't even difficult, the game itself isn't. Competitive Shooters, and  more so mobas are more difficult to do well in. He just now started  playing games other than shooters. He's played a top level in shooters, something you'll never reach. Get off your high horse, he's not even trying to be good at the game, just enjoying himself.

Idk about stealing but Thunderfury is BIS for a hunter tank (I am serious). As a hunter tank I've put many other tanks to shame and I am happy to talk about it more just let me know.
---
Tbh this problem isn't mine as I'm from australia. But I understand why people feel this way.
---
If you honestly think im gonna read that, you're out of your damned mind.
---
You'd hope so, but he never mentioned that such an addon exists, even outside Classic/Vanilla.
---
Oh god, one of those: "we all quit retail because we grew up and had kids" posts.  
---
Nobody quit playing retail because they got older and got married, they quit because the game sucks.  
---
&gt;I'm excited about classic
---
No you're not, you're excited for the next trial of style in a glorified barbie simulation game.  You're excited for 8.2 and afking warfronts for free gear.  You're excited to not play an mmo rpg, but endlessly add to a pointless transmog collection so only to impress people like asmongold.
---
[x] rekt.
---
Depends on the circumstance. If you know someone is about to take damage (say, you see them standing in the fire), mouse over may be more effective than waiting to see which of forty bars drops when the damage tick actually happens. 
---
I suspect it will end up being handy to have both options available, but I recall that not being terribly hard to set up.
---
I feel similarly.
---
I wonder how much of the changes to XP scaling and whatnot were a side-effect of the approach they took with expansions. I feel like the expansions end up trying to replace the base game instead of trying to co-exist with it. I started a character at the end of TBC and hit max during the start of Wrath. So many empty zones in classic content and then when I got to Outland I finally "caught up" with the player base. That capital city with the naruu had players coming and going (Org did too, but in a different way. Like mostly bank alts and such). Then Wrath launched and it was a ghost town. Everyone moved to Northrend.
---
I'm not sure I have a good answer for what co-existence should look like in WoW, but I think that's the biggest reason doing so many expansions has robbed the game of its character.
---
I think much of the classic/TBC playerbase was replaced in WotLK by players who want accessibility above all else (hence the term Wrath Babies)
---
Mmmm, spicy, I'm gonna use that, cheers.
---
We get it, you like to defend streamers.
---
And I understand why people shouldn't feel this way. I get your sentiment and the others but keep note not a single person can actually talk about what is and what isn't coming, because nobody knows. 
---
Trust me bud, even when people cannot speak English, it's an enjoyable experience. Nice people draw nice people. Toxic people(like some of the comments I'm getting) will only have a bad time. 
---
One person said "go try Dota 2 then" well if I did that and came back to say I outright refuse to play with people who can't speak English, I'd be a pretty disgusting human being, no?
---
[x] rekt
---
Fair enough. I did a bit of reading up on it myself and it seems there isn't a consensus on how many there are. But more than 5 for sure.
---
They are but you know reddit gangs, they like to circlejerk about the same thing every day even if it's been explained to death that layering will leave after the first few weeks. If it weren't for this, they would be complaining about another thing
---
I was watching Jordan something stream earlier tonight, he was a vanilla dev.
---
He said the best way to do it is tweak it so you can basically match servers based on faction population. Also make it adaptive so you end up playing the same pool of players still but reduce que times. If this makes ques not instant but say, no longer then 10 minutes, thats a win for everyone.
---
Easier said then done however, someone much smarter then I would have to figure out how that actually works.
---
For thought who don't know, the song is from the play "Avenue Q" and it's hilarious. It's basically dirty muppets. Other songs from the play include things like "Everyones a little bit racist" and "If you were Gay".

Unfortunately not a lot of people think like this. Did you forget the rage posts from the first stress test already? People don't know what they want.
---
Healslut
---
It is really hard to approximate but generally you would look at the damage values of a weapon rather than the dps of the weapon when deciding if you want it or not. The difference between a fast 2h weapon and a slow one can be like 20% dps when you first start raiding.
---
&gt;"Your realm is your world. You should never have to care about what happens on another realm"
---
You said that, those are your words. So how can you be in favor of cross-realm BGs?
---
Would be cool :)
---
Could you ELI5 it?
---
I’m happy with the idea of layering. As someone who can only play a few hours here and there, it would be a very disappointing launch experience if the first few hours I spend in the game would keep me from even finishing Durotar.
---
No problem. Read the replies before making a comment like that and my "name calling" specifically relates to "imagine thinking"
---
Which is rich, as you've just said this won't be a problem for you in Australia and your only experiences playing with "none-english" is playing with English new Zealanders. Lol. Nice.
---
I'm le confuse, you won't play until layering exists? It's exists from day one.
---
Honestly I just beefed up my computer so it could run free and I wouldn't notice it. It is a huge memory hog so I get it. It's hard for me to use my computers at work because they run on internet explorer.
---
RIP IN PEACE
---
Because being able to play BGs with my friends whenever we want without waiting is more important to my world than whatever names are above the people we’re fighting.
---
You won't play before layering is implemented? I'm confused
---
I only played classic WoW and my brother has been trying to get me to play it when it comes out.
---
I wasn’t really considering it but reading things like this will probably get me there.
---
No, I’m just going to play on a server that doesn’t have any and if some do end up on my realm just ignore them rather than obsess over them.
---
I do realize it is fun to watch as people gank him and see him tilting, but do you really enjoy everyday/every stream constant whining about how everything is shit, and bfa is bad, blah blah blah. I really don’t get it.
---
I had the same feelings about XQC in overwatch community, and didn’t understand why so much people love toxic streamers. Although in person they’re probably good human beings (I’ve seen asmons video on a anxiety topic),  they trying to be so toxic, and people love that.

Today's fast paced rush GO-GO-GO games aren't for me. I don't think it's for the vast majority, but there are no games that aren't like that because those games don't make as much money. So people don't know how good games could be...

It's shallow temporary fun and usually riddled with MTX.

I think humans prefer the more meaningful deep satisfaction you get from working towards a goal over a longer period of time. If they give it a chance (time).

Dota is a known toxic game. You can't relate every single experience you're ever going to have gaming with other languages to Dota. 
---
And keep in mind, we're becoming a far closer race on a global scale so just hold your breath and wait buddy. Wait. 
---
You also cannot take the stance of a know it all either, you come to me saying I'm making complete nothing statements but you're sat there using Dota as your only excuse for this ridiculous short-sighted argument. Do you not see how ridiculous it sounds saying things like that? Damn!
---
That’s a really good point. I think the super serious people might burn out quickly, due to how much better people are, in general, at video games and communication these days. 
---
But that’s not to say that the raiding experience as a whole for vanilla will be short lived. Either way I’m super interested to see how classic plays out. I’m rooting for it!
---
I prefer sw personally only because I know where everything is. IF is awesome because of the bank and AH being like in org right next to each other. I usually alternate between those 2 cities being my hearthstone. Low lvl human pally kept sw as my hearthstone till I was high enough to do sm runs then I would switch to IF to save flight time. And I would usually keep IF after that until 60 because it's closer the methil harbor for doing raids in kalimdor and for leeching dire maul buffs. The time you save is minimal but over the course of your time lvling and doing raids those few mins save a lot of time in the long run. FOR THE ALLIANCE
---
30 0 21 as already stated is pretty good for grinding, pvp and decent for raid healing (mostly chain healing). 
---
Other options may be 10 points in enhancement (to get the 2h axe/mace prof.) and put the rest in resto. This will make you a strong healer and gives you the option to switch it up and pray for the windfury procs. 
---
You probably need two sets of gear for both of these approaches: Healer set, ele set and melee set

Those glowing eyes and ghost wolves behind him is just how I see Thrall

OP played activision version of wow while classic is blizzards version of wow
---
Dont have beta to test it, either. Well in any case: it is something to remember and test when classic drops. If it works - good. If not - didnt really lose anything
---
old combat text? plss
---
Nah dude you’re wrong, I remember this happening.  Looks like it’s two internet strangers words against each other, oh know.
---
I think horde priest always should be undead, fits so well with SP too
---
Hell no! Those icons represent modern WoW and spit on the ideals of Classic.
---
I'd much rather see the old forum race icons instead!
---
I wish I had a gf and I could play with her
---
Don't forget the unreadable (for me atleast) polish/russian in world chat though.
---
"LFM Tank BRD"
---
*Invites person*
---
"у меня нет щита"

---
Seconded on the bard
---
Could have one healer spec and two dps specs. 
---
An AOE healing spec with some cool utility buffs
---
An AOE Damage Spec
---
And a Single Target DPS spec (like college of whispers/shadow priest sorta deal)
---
no way, bobby b is in this forum now. awesome!
---
I used to do the exact same! I remember logging on to IRC and getting a shout out at the end and being so happy.
---
I used to listen to all of the shows, but blue plz the most. I walked past TB at insomnia once as he was getting out of a taxi and I kick myself to this day that I didn't say hi. I also met Turpster at the cataclysm launch in London, didn't make the same mistake twice.
---
Lately I've been binging countdown to classic, which is great and very informative, but it's not wow radio :-(
---

Its far less of an issue at that point though. People will be naturally more spread out by level 10, there are more quests so skipping shitty "collect" quests isn't as big of a deal, and, most importantly, its much easier to just grind higher level mobs in a group at that point (more abilities to use), as well as the first dungeons coming on line (so dungeons runs for xp become an option as a worst case scenario choice).
---
Ugh.. 
---
I'm 32. I played Vanilla like a maniac when it came out. For straight up YEARS.
---
This time I have 3 kids and a job, so I'll be playing only once or twice a week for a few hours.
---
My point is: who gives a shit about sharding/layering ect? Who gives a shit about a paid beta, or even streamers? Take a fucking chill pill, folks!
---
WoW classic is back, and that's really nice. Can we just enjoy this nice thing?
---
From my memory, yes and no. Yes because sometimes you could not see people next to you, in crowded zones because of the latency of your internet connection: downloading data from the character was not a priority, so you could target a spot on n the ground moving, but not seeing the character. But they did not appear all of a sunder as you change zone.
---
No because it was progressive as, more and more characters were visible the longer you wait.
---
The distance to Blackrock Mountain from both Capitals is debatable, SW to Burning Steppes or IF to Searing Gorge, I'd say that Ironforge is probably closer. The time to get to Onyxia is hands down better from Ironforge because the Menethil boat to Theramore, which puts you closer to Onyxia's Lair/AQ as well as Dire Maul/Maraudon.
---
Add in the distance to Strat/Scholo and Ironforge is the best placed Capital for time saved through travelling.
---
Honestly I think Blizzard saw this coming with the reaction and drop-off of the last few expansions a month after launch - this way they are at least diverting people into another revenue stream they control rather than other games on other platforms (when you go to open WoW you open Battle.net which may make you more likely to stop and play a game or two of Hearthstone etc). It's fascinating from a strategy perspective.

No, for some reason this is a common thread. It's prepped up for release and the stress tests in between.
---
If you had beta you could play it, you can double check on the bnet site as well
---
they should talk a bit about measures they're taking to prevent abuse. or at the very least acknowledge concerns.
---
Ok
---
American mods don't want to have to read about regions that aren't America, especially when they're not Anglophone countries.
---
Who said 2 weeks? Last time I checked it was going to last 2-3 months.
---
This is a discussion about shadowmeld. What does your point contribute to it exactly?
---
I agree, I've never killed twin emperors or 4 horseman back in vanilla, so I have never seen Ouro, C'thun, Sapphiron, or KT.
---
But I wanted to see them, and seeing them in Lfr wouldn't have been the same thing
---
Barrens, my dude. The best and worst of chat always happens in the Barrens. God it felt so good to noatalgia meme while questing.
---
He's just mad. If all the discussion is consolidated into one thread he and his friends can't keep spamming the subreddit with new threads so it appears as if layering is a bigger issue than it is.
---
You’re mistaken
---
yea I thought the title was a bit misleading too, he didn't type "inv me to new layer" in world chat or something like that, he even says he shouldn't be able to do it (get invited to a new layer)
---
Exactly, it's comfy. That is the whole problem that it tries to cater to the new-age gamers who have the attention span of 5 seconds
---
Why isn't server merging an ideal solution?
---
I totally agree. I prefer slightly longer queue times. 20-30 minutes is perfect for me because I like to get other stuff done while I wait.
---
I'm genuinely excited that I got to be the level headed one for once. 
---
The cost of convenience is real, and I'm actually having a lot of second thoughts about playing because of this bizarre mindset.
---
Ok I checked bnet and can't find anything. Thanks!
---
Am i the only one who have not heard retail players complain this way?
---
There are different levels of it,though. Take a look at spell animations for example:
---
They look quite basic in vanilla. Probably a technical limitation of the time, but I still prefer it to the flashy, disco lights that go off after each button press now. ( main contender for this was paladin IMO. From holy warrior to walking lighthouse in just 2 addons)
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Same goes for models I guess.  And I am not even arguing that the old ones are better, just that they appeal to different people. Similar to how classic and bfa have different target audiences.
---
Np I wish they didn't rename all this shit, it's jebaiting everyone
---
That opinion will not actually be unpopular. But I grant that such being true never stops anyone from claiming that their popular opinion is unpopular (or the reverse).
---
don't speak for others. I would be perfectly content with at least some acknowledgement of the issues it can bring.
---
It caters to the old gamers who played vanilla and want that experience. I want the experience I had leveling wayyyy back in the day and layering accomplishes that.
---
You hit the nail on the head. The sense of a server community is dead in current WoW. In Vanilla you got to know people better and build relationships because you were forced to actually talk to people and had to work/struggle to make it. 
---
I used to play Horde on Shattered Hand back in 04-06. If you're reading this, Hi Satsloader.
---
which is my point exactly.
---
That scene is nerve wracking
---
Perfectly put. That's why humans are suffering with the introduction of industry, automation, curling parents and the obsession of positivity/happiness. And you can see it in the gaming industry too. Developers act like curling parents who do everything for their kid, even if it is with good intention. In the end, you end up with a child who is incapable of social interactions. Who is incapable of any type resistance and seek instant gratification in all ways possible. Everything is served on a silver plate and you lose the satisfaction. The equation of satisfaction involves [resistance+meaning*time=satisfaction]. When you remove time and resistance you essentially get what wanking of to porn is VS real sex. It feels good for a second after you nut, then you get this instant dissatisfaction that is followed by meaningless. Instant satisfaction is like advertising. You think you get the product, but they just sell you an empty feeling. There is nothing in it when you wrap it up because it was manufactured without true value and hardship. Just like a diamond is formed through hardship, so is satisfaction. We can make artifical diamonds, but they will never shine like one who has been formed and compressed for thousands of years. This is natural law, and an important one, to keep humans in contact with the production of things and not just the end result. And with this long ass text, let's end with the a pretentious quote &gt; "Life is about resistance, not instant satisfaction"
---
First time at the keyboard?

Yea, to each his own. I, for example, got several colleagues, who are in love with current paladin and enhancement visuals.

---
&gt;...  didnt ask my portuguese, italian, english friends with whom i used to play wow 
---
Thats what you wrote in your original post, so I assumed you already played on one server back then (the german one). If that would be the case, then it would have made no difference for you if there would be official language-realms and you could have picked the same realm langauge as in the past.
---
Additionally, you and your friends have to speak english anyway all day long when you want to play the game together, so for you and your friends there is no difference between official/non-official language realms. For example you can pick an official english speaking one.
---
Sure, as you stated, you might hope there will be different langauge-communities on one server if there are only EU-wide servers, but as it looks right now all languages will be separated anyway (and everybody has to find out by himself which server is for what langauge). So for you and your friends that would mean that you might land on a realm where 90% of the server speaks french, but you are lucky to get into a german guild. Do you really feel happy with that? Don't you think that this splits the community of one server in a bad way? I for myself think that IF there is a split between languages anyway, blizz can announce the "split" by themself.
---
Don't know if I have made that clear enough: I do not have a problem with EU-Wide servers if everybody agreees to speak english and no sub-langauge-clusters develop. But IF this happens, then I for sure prefer blizzard to announce language specific realms to make that split between the communities clear right from the beginning. Right now, it looks exactly like every langauge-community is targetting to play on the same server. So this is definitely a reason for me to prefer the official language split realms. The explanation is simply close-minded. Nobody is hindered to play with their friends anyway. I understand your point but you and your friends are simply the exception in my opinion and the explanation that you and your friends can not play "better" together does not justify to ignore the drawbacks of splitting in-realm-communities.
---
doesn't matter, layering takes away from the game itself and they are just doing it for the cashgrab. I would prefer the long queues and the eventual crashes, also much much much slower leveling especially on low level zones than layering. There are other ways to combat the server being too full, just bring down the population allowed on it. But no they want the retail crybabies not to have a crybabe experience and thats why we get this shitty layering system that is going to harm the economy and the game the first few weeks, if they don't go back on their word.
---
I think realms had different layer sizes, not that every layer had different sizes on each realm. I joined a lot of layers on 3 and they were all equally dead.
---
I mean what are they gonna do when they realize more people like classic? What will the point of layering be when the game outshines retail just like runescape? Server merges may be inevitable
---
I'm hoping they tune the values up a bit to make up for the 1.12 talents. There's also progression to consider, a bunch of fresh 60 with no +hit and low mana pools would probably have a hard time getting anywhere in MC.
---
Mostly "many" mechanics doesn't necessarily translate into difficult mechanics. I saw a comparison between 60 Naxx and 80 Naxx at some point  and they compared some of the same mechanics and they were made an insane amount less punishing in 80 Naxx. The one I remember was a poison debuff applied to a lot of the raid at once. In Vanilla people needed healing within 4 seconds or they were dead, vs about 12 seconds... Plus I've seen a bunch of "avoid the dangerous parts of the floor when they switch colors and give you plenty of warning" type mechanics in retail fights. Compared that to "keep a constant eye on Onixia, if you don't and waste a single second getting to the correct side you're dead like dinner." As someone who quit pre-raiding WotLK, I'm genuinely interested to see how retail players cope, should be interesting either way.
---
I agree! clearly something a big brained individual would say, as we both are!
---
I loved LFG at the time it first came out.  It's when they made it cross realm that it sucked.  Mainly because you could be grouped up with an awesome group from a different server and if you wanted to keep on doing things with that group (aside from requeuing) you couldn't.  It gave that aspect of the game a less personally feel also.  Before the cross realm LFG was a great way to find a group of friends or even a guild, or a way into a better guild.  I wasn't saying it was a bad thing it was just one of those things that took away one cool aspect in order to make way for a different aspect.  I mean if you were a DPS it opened up a whole new world for finding groups lol.  As a tank it didn't matter one way or another for me.  
---
That being said what the final straw for me originally leaving the game was the build/spec changes that came with MOP.  I played the Beta and hated that you couldn't cross spec anymore.  I felt it took away a very unique and personal feel of the game.
---
I agree on a baseline mainly because I like the increased polygons and updated texture resolution... but I think they could have done a better job at recreating the original look of the models when they updated them.
---
Typical American then
---
Sweet summer child.
---
You've never worked in analytics, why are you making assumptions about a field you know absolutely nothing about?
---
Saying Bizzard have absolutely no data is naive - Blizzard know they pool from a large dormant playerbase that play the start of expansions, they also know how many people are interested in classic based on demographics - how many old players of the game are playing now, how many people used the beta signup etc.
---
Also, check out the response the beta got on twitch, it wasnt HUGE - but you can compare that with other game demographics also.
---
Classic will likely boil down to a 'low' amount of players (still in the hundreds of thousands) after the initial few months of hype, but will definitely start off high.
---
What they choose to do after classic burns out will define WoW for the next decade. If they choose to go the old school runescape route, and I pray they do, it could be fantastic.
---
This game is named world of WARCRAFT. I've been playing warcraft 2-3 since i was a kid and was my favourite game.   
---
The story of Illidan and Arthas ended by wotlk and the game went on like a series that cashes in good money so the writers add some totally retarded bullshit to it, just to milk the series a bit more. Same thing happened to wow.   
---
Destroying the whole world and recreating it is just as cheesy as using time travel to deal with the gordian knot. Oh wait they did use time travel not so late after that. I went little away from the topic, but what i wanted to say is that the literal world of warcraft ended by wotlk.   
---
Of course game design had a lot to do with it, but i think everyone got a little bit distanced from the story.
---
That's the thing. Current WoW is just an MMO. Classic WoW is an MMORPG.
---
In this article, a Blizzard dev comments that phasing was invented to solve a problem in Burning Crusade, so it at least should remove whatever falls under "phasing" from the question of what was in this clip.  [https://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news\_index.php?story=25192](https://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=25192) 
---
My memory of vanilla is that what happened in the clip did not happen in the game. Sometimes people would appear suddenly, but that was due to lag or some hardware factor, particularly when moving at high speeds. It didn't happen consistently in a particular place as I assume it would have done in this clip.
---
thank you for your passion! 
---
keep on raging.
---
Sure but most dungeons were way too long to just run out and just a few of them had a nice shortcut exit like deadmines.
---
Also, elite mobs in the pre-instance and stuff.
---
"Port to IF/Org plz"
---
Leeway is a massive buff to all melee.
---
Hunter min deadzone is bugged as well and the min range is much bigger than it should be.
---
This seriously goes against everything that is great about vanilla, why re make it just to butcher it?
---
&gt;we get a system down where i sap
---
This makes me happy. Crowd control was an essential part of the game in vanilla. As someone who played heavily in vanilla and only a bit over the post WotLK expansions, it drives me nuts when I suggest a sheep or a sap or a hunter trap to reduce the number of mobs and people react like I'm crazy.
---
I love that as someone who never played in the early days that you thought about your abilities and realized you could use them to this end. That's a lot of what we were doing back then - figuring out how to get the most out of our skills. 
---
People will argue that you didn't need CC for everything but using it meant you could do harder content - you didn't need to be overgeared for everything. You could go into a dungeon at he earliest possible level and through careful planning, accomplish what less-organized players couldn't do five levels higher. Group composition mattered. You couldn't just bring any random classes. 
---
That was a large part of the social portion too. If you grouped with people who knew what they were doing. You'd want to seek them out again. You made connections from there.
---
I'm glad you're getting to discover this. Maybe if more new players realize how rewarding a more challenging MMO can be, the next retail expansion will shift back in that direction.
---
boomer meme
---
Because every time they add a new class it's retardedly op.
---
Not really. The best leveling efficiency is actually smitepriest.
---
If that is their concern they could just announce that support is only given in english. Where is the problem? Splitting the servers by langauge officially is nothing more than a language tag in the realm name if you ask me. Or am I missing something?
---
You better not have a different opinion than I do!
---
There’s no key ring at all on the beta, it likely wouldn’t have shown up had he been able to get a key anyways
---
I think you made an orc with a human physique xD
---
See this is exactly the problem, you think your situation is the same and that the demand comes only from people who just speak English. As I said before that is not the case. It is NOT only people with an English mother tongue who want you to speak English. English is the international language of the world. Thinking German or French is comparable is plain wrong and incredibly nationalistic. It will take the least effort for you to adapt to the world and not the other way around. And if you think that is unfair I'll agree. But the situation you proposed is even more unfair and makes you come off like someone who only cares about himself.
---
Also it would probably help you if you stopped dubbing everything, you'll be surprised how easy it is for people to adapt.
---
Hey, quick question. How difficult was Isha Awak? Do you think a Priest and Warrior could down him in the early teens? He ends a long quest chain that rewards a really good wand that I want to get my hands on ASAP. You can start the chain at level 10 in the Barrens.
---
All you had to say was "they're going to cause irreparable damage to the auction house and within a few weeks be market leaders on many items and thus removing the legitimacy around pricing."
---
That's all you had to say. That's exactly what's going to happen and no I'm not happy about it. BUT. I do also understand their argument and it does make sense, I'd rather blizzard took a strong stance on the no-lifer farming behaviour and went to town on those trying to manipulate the auction house early game. Once layering is removed(here's hoping) I'd expect them to take the necessary precautions and remove the advantages gained by those abusing the layering system. No matter how ridiculous that may sound, at this point it is your only cure.
---
phase two would legitimately be ruined by phasing.
---
you can't have two Kazzak spawns on one server.
---
even Ion has said so.
---
I always invested that one talent point into a miniscule bonus instead of taking the spirit of shame.
---
Its only at launch.
---
Im personally pretty confident that right at the start, if you are in an area that you are being ganked, switching layers will just put you with another group of people ready to gank you. The pop is going to be super high.
---

---
The ench soec seems cool.. there is not a 30/21/0 spec?
---
About the gear is prob true but as the only mail wear that uses spell dmg in the horde..may not he that bad
---
exactly my point. But many people still lime them, so to each his own
---
There’s probably 50 threads a day about this
---
Private realms have wrong damage values. People do too much compared to the gear and what people used to do, by a large margin. Well see how it goes come live
---
WW3 is fought in Azeroth. ^^
---
And then after 2 years of grinding, Blizzard wipes your character and you gotta start all over again
---
This did not happen in vanilla no

---
&gt;Queuing up for RFC in classic
---
Wut
---
It worked fine for me
---
no one said he was crazy, everyone said he was a piece of shit for thinking that should be worth blacklisting them from the game.
---
Sankyu
---
That being said: I'm one of those people that wouldn't mind the option of using the new character models in classic WoW (minus the new animations, I never liked those).
---
But then again, I'm not a no-changes shill either, so what do I know?
---
I feel like the proportions are a little off. Hands being too small, shoulders a little narrow and angled too far forward, etc...
---
nitpicking aside that is awesome, love the detail in the face... I didn't realise until just now how much I wish WoW did a line of warhammer figures (like LOTR Warhammer)
---
Lock pets are really garbage too, idk about less bad when imp literally just does nothing in prob 50% of fights even spamming petattack and firebolt.
---
hunter has the worst nerfs in classic atm.
---
&gt;pet pathing and AI is literally fucked
---
&gt;melee leeway doesnt let you kite melees properly
---
&gt;heartbeat mechanic seems to be waaay worst meaning people can break your trap earlier
---
on top of that some melees got buffed, rogues can apply poison by sapping/gouging you, he doesnt lose combo points anymore by switching targets (ccing your pet)
---
It will happen anyway naturally. It much better to coordinate in advance and let everyone know, otherwise you'll find yourself at level 60 on a server where the majority speaks a language that you don't understand.
---
You haven’t watched enough of his content. The reason people watch him is because he speaks his mind regardless of positive/negative. If he believes something is good he will speak highly of it and if he thinks it’s dog shit he’ll call it out. Watch vid of him talking about 8.2 if you don’t believe me. It directly contradicts your statement that all he does is call BFA bad. Asmon is not toxic, although his chat is despite his best efforts. Impossible to perfectly police 900k+ internet users.
---
What a moron you are. Rather than enjoying the game, you’re going to spend your time forming a group to hunt streamers - at which point the streamer gets a bigger group and steamrolls you, leading to either a) you bring massively pissed off for something you started or b) having a great world pvp experience and owing much of it to the streamer
---
I love how you even edited that Monologue, as if anyone will ever read it.
---
 \[x\] rekt
---
&gt;Ahem... Mana problems? With Life Tap?  
---
Yup, life tap not that great. You'll be getting about 1 lifetap for 2 shadowbolts. So it effectively slows your shadowbolt by .75 seconds, it tanks your dps if you're relying on it for mana - and that's if a healer is happy with you constantly tapping away for mana.   
---
Frost mage has much better efficiency with frostbolt and has gems/evocate.
---
it's ok, you'll have the rest of your life to be right.
---
fine, for now we'll go with gullible idiot.
---
have a nice weekend!
---
Yea it didnt Lol how can you remember phasing in vanilla and tbc when it literally didnt exist????? Its not hard to go on youtube and find a video of people going from org and if to go outside and duel and you Will see it doesnt phase like it does on the beta at all..  there Was a render distance for other characters but they wouldnt all pop up out of nowhere when you zoned

oh okay i didn't read the original comment properly yeah you get xp and xp gets you levels you're not level 11 the whole time you're in westfall guys. start where he says to and do the quests as you can i did it in the exact same order and it was really easy. lvl 11 warrior has no problems in westfall except heirloom quest and the last peoples militia you will need someone with you or to go to loch modan and grind out some levels there.
---
yea, I’d really love to have it as a toggle-able option, cuz it’s client side and doesn’t affect anyone. For me personally it would be more aesthetically appealing
---
And watching an Undead male dance while Gwen Stefani is on repeat and the Queue timer is ticking *up*.
---
I can only hope the future of Classic wow is half as successful at OSRS has been. RS would be dead without OS and OS wouldn’t be nearly as popular as it is without the changes they’ve made to the game. Classic *has* to do the same. It’ll have to evolve eventually because any game, as good as it may be, gets stale if it never changes. I can only hope Blizzard does nearly as well as Jagex has with OSRS
---
Exactly, I just want a fun and rewarding game. If BFA was a better game, I'd definitely be playing it along side classic
---
I meant first hit. Not at enrage. But I guess he still one shots most tanks without close to bis. Bad analogy.
---
You're low-balling it!
---
Farm your epic mount. Nothing is as much of an upgrade as na epic mount early.
---
Layering ruins exclusivity and the fun of farming certain items/mobs since people Can just hop a later to get tidal charm instead of spending 20 hrs camping it, doing pvp to Secure the spot and Finally getting it and feeling happy because Its not easy to get due to competition. Its the same for certain elite q mobs or essence/devilsaur/Lotus farming the whole point of an mmo (of playing with others) is to compete. With lasering everyone is free to find a layer where they Can get whatever they want in minutes instead of hours conpeting.
---
But suuuuure layering gooood )))
---
Bro that underbite.. No wonder..
---
Absolutely true for me.
---
I look forward to play a priest in classic. And I still have an 87 priest on retail i could slowly level in the meantime. When I still had an active sub last month. I logged into the priest, looked at it ingame, at the spellbook and had zero motivation to play this fucking game.
---
I know my GM (roleplay guild) is worried it may split the roleplay community.
---
Yes, they did actually.  Specific locations this did indeed happen, whether you want to believe it or not.  I know you've probably been playing on private servers and think you know everything about vanilla but that's just not the case, I'm sorry.
---
Let me tell you soemthing about the people on reddit. When Blizzard first announced Classic, I had discussions with some about the release date.
---
Them:
---
"Blizzard can just take the Nostalrius server and fix some bugs! Why would it take months?"
---
If you are alliance, go for bonebiter instead
---
Constant incremental changes. Same way a child turns into an adult without ever seeing a different person in the mirror.
---
Ok but druid and warlock are fast levelling classes lol so if anything it's biased the other way, they are being over-represented in a max level sample.
---
this meme has transcended into cringe
---
this is super wrong you don't even want to touch shadow until you're your mid 40's.
---
Waah live sucks im gonna go whine in classic

I'm extremely curious where you're pulling these statistics from. Is it from a little place called "my ass"?
---
That’s a lot you learned in one stress test..... fake and gay
---
Left side! Even Side! Handle it!
---
I don't limit myself to one game, and we're on reddit, not in game.
---
Waaaluigi
---
yeah wasnt ps2 2002ish?
---
From someone who got raided up to C'thun (couldn't kill him) in classic, the mechanics of raid fights were never the hard part.
---
Getting 39 other people geared up when bosses dropped two to three pieces of loot at a time was the massive wall that blocked you from progressing.  And sometimes paladin loot would drop for horde and vice versa, it was like not getting a drop at all.
---
That, and trash respawned after about 30 minutes for the boss you were on.  Oh, and there were no "checkpoints" where you zone in deeper into a raid after a boss dies.  
---
If you die to Nefarian in BWL, you respawn in the graveyard in Searing Gorge.  Have to ghost run back to the instance portal, then run the entire way through BWL back up to Nefarian's balcony. THEN you waited for his twenty minute respawn.
---
You'd still be stuck playing BFA if it wasn't for those people dumb ass
---
Farm epic mount.
---
Farm proffessions and ingredients.
---
Farm gold.
---
Do dungeons for early pre-bis items.
---
&gt;  there is no fix to layering/sharding/phasing
---
DISABLE 👏 PHASING 👏 OR  👏 NO 👏 BUY !!
---
Get Ony attunement, lvl professions, get your pre-bis, farm BGs, farm epic mount and do stuff you guild might need like boosting healers/tanks and farming mats.
---
What am i missing?
---
That it is not worth it?
---
I am completely obsessed about it. I have been binging countdown to classic. The other night I was listening to it right before bed and in the morning my partner said I was talking about DPS in my sleep &gt;.&gt;
---
&gt;What are some things we should do once we hit 60 to take advantage of the slight competition?
---
If I tell you and the 142.147 people that browse this sub it won't put me in advantage anymore.
---
THEY PUT ION IN THE GAME, ISNT THAT ILLEGAL????
---
No bgs till phase 2 and he's talking about people who will level in the first weeks, not months later.
---
It only works for a party member and was just made for specifically testing things like hitbox/deadzone/leeway/spell range. It's useless in actual combat.
---
Wg rip.  wow kiddos would sudoku over it today.
---
Why not ;-)
---
Ooga Gang has it sorted
---
not a bug.
---
If you can't handle simple banter, I don't want you in the community, sorry.
---
Depends. Did you hit 60 to raid the first or second week? If so you're gonna want that attunement and to farm as much gear as possible.
---
Otherwise I'd just be farming for Epic Mount.
---
but its in the middle of the water and it also has the same design (in a bigger form) tho
---
My issue is picking a server and spending a month levelling to then find I've rolled on a server where the majority are speaking French/German/Spanish. Then having to re-roll somewhere else. 
---
As I plan to level from day one, there's no way around this. It'll be pot luck on picking the right server. 
---
Hopefully we get more information on server names etc. Closer to release and an unofficial nationality will be tagged onto it through reddit/forums.
---
&gt; I probably had more player interaction in one hour of classic than in more than two years of playing current WoW. 
---
This...
---
Layering should just aggressively try to fill up first layers. So when you are in layer 1 and someone from layer 3 invites you and layer 1 is not full, then the guy who invites you should get pushed into layer 1, instead of how it is right now, where everyone gets ported to the one who invites.
---
Aggressively force layer 1 and layer 2 to be filled up, then people can't just switch between them and exploit it to farm resources or to escape the enemy faction.
---
signed
---
depending on current state of the game rank 3 pvp and exalted with your mount faction along with money for 20% discount
---
after that, bis gear
---
starting with weapons, longest lasting item or easiest to obtain.
---
depending on server population and dungeons running. if you the first 60 the items obtained from quests are probably your start.
---
along gear farming get your onyxia/mc prequests done.
---
unless you plan to be your servers enchanter or other traid profession i would wait with them.
---
gathering professions after epic mount if you have them
---
Enhance. Your friend will love WF and the address dps. You'll still be able to drop a heal as needed and heal dungeons with not much issue.
---
Right
---
This just proves blizz knows what we want, they just dont want to do it.
---
Personally? Their fan base. But hate is the wrong word. Loath? Loath is probably good. Detest also works. 
---
But then again, I plan to solve this by simply avoiding them. I’d love for Blizzard to come up with a way to quarantine them to a few specific servers, but I don’t actually there is either a possible or ethical way to do that, so I’m just going to pick the server with the fewest streamers (well, some metric that really tracks total playing follower base). 
---
Essentially, this is a problem that I can almost certainly solve. So I will. “Solutions” that rely on other people acting the way I want them to deserve their quote marks. After all, if they were going to do what I wanted, we would never have had the basis for me to care about them in the first place. 
---
So, sure. I detest them. But that’s my problem. I’ll be the adult and quietly move on with my life away from the problem so long as that remains reasonably possible. Which, from what I’ve seen, should be close to trivial.
---
Br Br Br br
---
Prove to me that you aren't either lying or that you haven't listened to a ton of content around why classic is good...
---
Your analysis is spot on. So I'm skeptical as fuck.
---
OP, why do you insist on being an evil person?  You are broadcasting a plan to make the playing experience of a certain group become hell just because they belong to this certain group.
---
Does this remind you of ANYTHING? You are a bad, evil person.
---
"how useful is a life vest on a plane?"
---
"Not as useful as a parachute"
---
Yeah, really helpful.
---
&gt;  And then they fully merged all layers and a tidal wave of people came rushing into Trade District and the lag started.
---
&gt; THEN I KNEW
---
its a mostly 10 year old engine...
---
with server tech today it should be effortless to have that many low level characters in a city.
---
Read the post again. Most of that behavior applies regardless of game.
---
But there are already class flairs on the subreddit.
---
For me, healing is the most fun I had in WoW.
---
If they do like another fresh launch years down the line, I think most of it will be worked out by then. (Hopefully with no layering too). This is going to be a completely scuffed launch. There's so many game breaking bugs, exploits, layers, the pet classes currently don't even work, etc. I think they'd be better off pushing the release back, honestly.
---
That's how I remembered it.
---
"yes we will have flying"
---
It's kinda true. Saurfang never really gave a shit about anything, hahaha. Not till WoTLK.
---
Retail WoW feels like playing GTA with all the cheats on. You've got all the fancy weapons, you kill everything you look at, you teleport around the world instantly, and you're swimming in money.
---
And just like in GTA, it gets old real fast. There is no real sense of progression, and nothing is a challenge.
---
Shouldn't be too surprising that people find Classic WoW to be more enticing. It's honestly beyond me why Blizzard fails to recognize this problem with the current state of the game. It seems rather obvious.
---
Happy Cake Day! I always called it DM, but my buddy calls it VC, and started the argument in trade on accident LOL good times
---
Never played classic and started in wotlk and left during mop. Vanilla sounds amazing in every aspect except one that i cant judt get over and honestly turns me away a little bit. The 16 limit debuff on raid bosses. I was watching raid videos from vanilla and it just looks terribly boring for a warlock to have 1 or zero dots on a boss and just literally casting a single spell. I understand it was a big aspect of vanilla (and ive read that the complainers need to fuck off because it was main mechanic of the game) but it just sounds like it takes away from the entire game. Not being able to use half your abilities. I know itll never happen but if they could just get rid of the debuff limit and change hp or damage to balance it out. Its the single drawback about classic for me that just seems like it will be so unfulfilling to raid once i get there and am beyond excited and then to just manage 2 or 3 spells over and over again
---
\#No Layering or No Buy
---
All flairs are hunter flairs
---
wow when did chuck fuck your mom???
---
It is helpful when you are deciding what to bring. And in this case both of those racials are way better than Shadowmeld.
---
Only other ones that might be interfering are tampermonkey and stylus, but neither of them have any scripts/styles set for reddit
---
Sorry but this is just aggaravting to read.
---
For YEARS retail loyalists have been shitting on people who want to enjoy classic. YEARS of some fucking scumbag shitheads telling us we don't know what we want, rose tinted goggles, "i hope something bad happens to your experience" and other vitriol.
---
I don't have a lot of sympathy left for these shitstains. I try not to talk their experience down like they did ours and I know it's not all retail players that are like this, but the ones who are can go fuck themselves hard. All these "rose tinted goggles" assholes can go get beat up in an alleyway for all I care for the abuse they threw around at a community that only wanted to have their game back.
---
Wtf paladin is the MOST complex, *especially* from 1-50.
---
The beta doesn’t have layering issues it’s just completely dead. Ironforge was empty on stress test server 3 though and that was a layering issue
---
Its beta. They need to test it. Just buy some fresh bread from the dwarf lady and wait for release (;
---
So let's be egoistical pigs and deny others their fun, so my fun is not impacted.
---
I'd have to find the source but a blizzard person im like 90% certain said that they intend to have layering for 2 weeks, then remove it because having multiple worlds would ruin a lot of end game stuff
---
Woah.. I just tried IE to confirm. They don't appear on Chrome!?
---
Did you read what they wrote?
---
I never said he didn't like classic. He'll probably be playing. Buy splitting a community is something some people are worried about.
---
Why can’t we love both? I love retail, my characters have been around through the ages of wow. I really enjoy playing through all the new expansions with them. My computer has been busted for almost 3 months now and I can’t wait to get back in. I decided it was a convenient excuse for a break but I’m getting parts replaced just for classic. I joined the game in tbc, that’s as close to classic I ever got. But I’m super excited about playing the “prequel”, if you will, for my current characters.
---
And i know it sounds kinda whiney. But i won't go to Classic with layering. It's just one of those things (even if it's not the same as phasing/sharding) it's not supposed to be there and it will be abused.
---
#nochanges (atleast not a big one as layering).
---
Those who can hit 60 that fast dosent need to ask these questions
---
/u/Soupasoka confirm?
---
I'm not really into PvP so I may just be way off base here.  Your point #4 could be an issue when a lower level player is getting camped and asks for help in General/LocalDefense from higher level players.  The lowbie may get just sucked away to safety, and the others miss out on their fun.  
---
Maybe that's not a common scenario, and it's worth losing that to prevent other abuse, I dunno.
---
Your title is shit..
---
Biggest hope for us being continuing classic with new content in the spirit of classic
---
Second biggest hope being for Blizzard to take notes and classify retail.
---
But they're NEVER gonna get rid of flying, they tried in WoD. Neither of 25 difficulty modes, pokemon and other garbage that pollutes this game. There is too much of a fan base for this crap to remove it. 
---
Maybe the best course of action is making another expansion that is so horrible that everyone leaves, so the next expansion can be a clean slate.
---
Theres only room for 50 ignores in vanilla
---
I think Classic would be as good as ever
---
Very true
---
With a normal setup there aren't 25k people on a server, there are max 3-4k or so, there are just more servers.
---
No, you can camp someone for as long as you like. Stalking someone counts as player harassment, which would require two accounts or friends on the opposite faction to check which zone they are in so you could follow them across zones.
---
Ganking and camping is something you sign on for when you make a character on a PvP server.
---
Interactions can get weird. Just because it shouldn’t interact doesn’t mean it actually doesn’t.
---
shouldnt it be female warriors aswel?
---
Why can’t you make flying work while being able to Pvp. They thought about it before. Just let us do things on our mount just like in Pvp. And melle can hop to your mount and attack you on it with their regular rotation.
---
But I always wanted classic wow to be a restart like osrs was. I think this is where the direction of the game should go imo. The best of both worlds.
---
Always good to ask questions, you never know what you might learn
---
Woah what? That's crazy, they probably need to send out more waves to get things tested. Couple hundred peak pop is not enough to test the vanilla world..
---
I think in arena it's more because you want them to hear what you're saying.  In 3s if you say something once it can get muffled by the other 2 people saying something.  If you say it 3 times it has a better chance of sticking and being heard.
---
I was a warrior on a pvp server and leveling was rough solo.  I remember doing Mara over and over for safe leveling and then some amazing world pvp.  I loved pvp during Vanilla and hated it in TBC, mainly spell power went up to fight new boss hp at a much higher rate than our own hp. 
---
Any case, off rambling. A lot of classes had crowd control.   Doing any dungeons and it was needed, especially a rogue with improved sap.  I know it got more easy mode in Wrath, but I also went from a MC and BWL raider to a casual with a baby, school and work.  
---
Some days I miss the more needed skill and group comp, but there was easy toxic ness that happened if you did not know how to play. Other days I like the pull a group and air and move on from trash. Maybe the key is a balance?
---
It is a much different game and glad you are liking it. Makes me excited.
---
I am 99% sure this didn’t happen.. in general the whole phase-switching is super awkward and wasn’t that visible.
---
United Kingdom (47%)

---
We don't know. We really don't. I'm with you on being sceptical about the whole "retail will die because classic is the superior game". People fail to realize that there are people out there who love walking simulators, Farming Simulator, The Sims and other games that are unbearably boring and stupid to me. Just look at the market and what's popular. To think that classic will convert all these people is ... bold.
---
I hope so and MAYBE a lot of these people have just never tasted the enjoyment of playing a challenging game, but these people talking like it's a sure thing are equally as annoying as the "rose tinted glasses" naysayers. What's worse is that if they're right they'll take it as "I KNEW it" rather than "I was lucky with my statistically entirely unfounded assumption that was based purely on my subjective experience."
---
thats still a few hundred people fighting for exp but only on wipe day.
---
And everything ive looked up shows more players than that. And obviously more people are gonna play classic because its well, classic
---
Same here, definitely not the case. If I was outside IF PvPing I could see people running down the entrance hallway.
---
30 21 0 may not be to good in pve. In raids you should always be healing. It may be possible to go 30 enhancement and 21 resto. But I am not sure if the increased melee attack power is worth all the healing/support power you lose. 
---
The latter 0 30 21 spec may be viable for enhancement shamans in raids but that role is a bit niche as healing shaman is always prefered. 
---
If you aim for finkle lava dredger (or whatever the mace is called) in MC you would need the 10 points in enhancement anyways. Its an awesome 2hander for healing and it has great damage for the juicy wf procs.
---
Don't wanna be
---
Put fiery on some low level white weapons, sell them, make bank
---
Y'all
---
I feel Burning Crusade was also quite good, never really played Wrath a lot (gave up early on) but it seemed to continue the theme.  Dungeons were hard.  Heroic dungeons were VERY hard.  Missed Cataclysm, Pandaland, Legion and have come back for Battle for Azeroth but something's missing.
---
Maybe because some of the people complaining are from europe, and can't speak english very well. And the very first thing you learn in any language are usually insults.
---
What about the people who recall this and didn’t spend any notable time on a pserver?
---
Wouldn’t view distance have the closer people render first? Not just a whole bunch of people at once.
---
It's kinda sad that so many people cannot take this away from this. Years of abuse from the "rose tinted goggles" assholes and once we won some people are not good sports about it but have to turn the tables and become the assholes they always resented for telling them that what they find fun is garbage.
---
If anything it just goes to show that reddit's emotional maturity on average is ridiculously low and one can only hope that this is because they're actually stupid kids and not grown ups with the brain of a 12 year old.
---
If you're going oom as shadow you're doing it wrong.
---
&gt;Best of all, I met so many players grouping up for quests, questing and dungeons
---
and the best about it is that it feels so natural. It takes forever to kill an enemy and you have to kill 10 or more of them. Then there is this other player. It's such a nobrainer to immediately just invite him in a group and do the quest together.
---
And there is no dungeonfinder tool where people are like "sry, can't group up because I'm in queue for a dungeon right now". If you're out there questing, you are out there questing and you are gladly taking that opportunity to group up.
---
Paladin warrior
---
I feel like you would have to know english to even find a private server. Which means 99% of people on private servers would speak english.
---
Sure, but it's something people have dealt with fine before in various MMORPG/PServer launches, it's not a big deal.
---
The total amount of people doesn't matter, only the amount per server.
---
HAHAHAHA eLvEs ArE gAy RiGhT gUyS????!!! xD 😂😂💯
---
&gt;  A month would be more than enough for Blizzard that keeps track to decide if realm is dying and when vast majority of people have not reached level cap yet, and merge them, and a month old community is malleable enough to recover from this nebulous, vague damage you think is direct cause of mergers.
---
This goes against literally everyone who is screaming "but muh early level friend building".  Seriously, I don't get how you can say this is a solution while at the same time say layering is bad because it ruins early community building.
---
IMO the most downvoted comments in this thread are also the most correct. He may be rude and condescending but he’s not wrong at all. Vanilla was not like this..
---
I understand the view distance argument and this aint it chiefs
---
We may not have EU dedicated language realms...but god was good to us.
---
We dont have this kiddos and streamers.
---
From the only other game that's comparable to Classic WoW, Old School Runescape's 2013 release, which saw over 40,000 people on launch day, down to under 15,000 a few months later.
---
A huge chunk of the people who play Classic in the first month are only going to check it out for a few days or weeks and then leave. That will happen no matter whether Classic is good, bad, amazing, spectacular, whatever. 
---
We can agree that the only people who will be playing Classic in 6 months from launch are the people who either are 
---
a) already dedicated fans or
---
b) try it out to see what it's like and end up loving it
---
The number of people who will install Classic "just to try it out" is going to be fucking enormous, and unless you're suggesting that over 90% of people who try Classic will want to stick around, then a massive dropoff of userbase a few months into the game is inevitable. Not because it's overhyped, not because it's bad, and not because people didn't want Classic - simply because Classic is being so well marketed and promoted so heavily that almost every single person with a passing interest is going to at least try it. But most of those people won't stick around.
---
That's correct, although it's more bothersome having to click every single foreign item when, if it were to be in english, you can often tell if you are interested in the item at a glance.
---
Someone selling [Minerai de cuivre] for 20s? Better click it and see what it is.
---
Someone selling [Copper ore] for 20s? Disinterested at a glance.
---
To me its this is not true, to the simple fact that the shadow tree have shadow focus, also there is alot of nice dmg improvement talent in shadow... 
---
And shadow can heal anything
---
I also think that shadow priests is the most mana efficient class of all times
---
Other than might buff, why paladin?
---
People are getting defensive about the idea layering is shit. Watch out, we might take away their easy access to Vanilla..
---
Hi, /u/YaboiAndrei
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c3nu07/hey_guys_so_ive_seen_layering_being_mentioned_a/). 
---
Well yeah 0.5s is too big of a window I guess.  But BFA is too short.
---
I don't think it has anything to do with view distance.  I remember this happening in certain spots in early WoW regardless of view distance (the river seperating durator and barrens for example).
---
I wish more people like this would exist the game at launch
---
Eve has four races, and each race has three different starting "zones". But after you finish the starting zone, everyone spreads out, and each "guild" usually sets their "hearth" in a different place. There is a capital "city", but people avoid it unless they need to go there. There are no quests nor gathering nodes in the capital, nor any other reason to visit except trade.
---
There is a (separate) auction house everywhere, and enough repeatable quests to satisfy everyone at every level. Except for PvP and trade, nobody ever has any reason to travel. Imagine if your guild was based in Moonbrook and my guild was based in Aerie Peak, and we each never really went anywhere else, except on special occasions for raids and battlegrounds. That's Eve.
---
You forget all the Serpiroths in original Guild Wars...
---
I mean it just seems like its gonna be a big problem IMO. and the more total people there are the more there are per server unless they make more but that will cost them more
---
Who recall it not happening?  I don't know what to tell them, there were certain spots where this did happen.  Can I say for 100% certain that it happened at this exact spot?  No, since it was so long ago but there were certain places where it did happen and I have faint memories of it happening at this spot as well because I spent a lot of time dueling outside of IF.
---
#no changes
---
I back this though, the best guild on my server in wrath was for 'Danes Only' and they wouldnt invite anyone who wasnt fluent. You also had the stress of some people who were great in game joining voice chat and suddenly their English is broken and they'd get left out of things unfairly.  
---
That said some of my best friends were forged in this game and growing up many of them are now dotted around Europe and when I travel for work it's great meeting up with them so I don't mind too much. It's easy being the English language speaker though hah.
---
Well marketed? What marketing is it getting? Aside from reddit and streamers there really isn't much "marketing". The average joe who's not on reddit and and doesn't watch streamers won't be following it very much.
---
Every day I have a look at the classic talent calculator trying to figure out what my end-game tree would look like, and what my leveling spec should be so I wouldn't have to respec too many times etc.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/014005001-5050501303022151-05002
---
What is this rush..? Jesus..
---
I'm 99% sure it did, considering it definitely happened at the river seperating durator and barrens for example.
---
Just in case it wasn't clear from the deeper comment threads: that's completely wrong. The highest number is 9%, but NOT total DPS. Only an increase of your AP scaling on instant attacks. Instant attacks are anywhere from 50-70% of your damage, but that's not where the "math" ends. They use your weapon damage, have some internal base damage and then scale with AP. And only the last part is bugged.
---
This is a change of 2-4%, maybe slighly less.
---
I am thinking about making public my theory crafting around Arcane mage (mage using AM) in vanilla, is this something that anyone would be interessted in?
---
&gt; The fights naturally have no to few mechanics
---
The *bosses* have fewer mechanics, but that doesn't necessarily translate to easier fights. Players have more mechanics they need to keep an eye on in every fight as well (aggro, mana management) - and you have 40 people contrasted to maximum 25, which in itself adds a lot of noise, points of failure (my go-to is running into C'thun's room) and randomness to every encounter.
---
You are probably right in that MC and *parts* of BWL will be easier than they were in Vanilla - simply because we start out with 1.12 talent trees, and those weren't in for most classes when people were actually progressing through those raids.
---
But from a certain point, the sheer numberocity of encounters will make them pretty hard. As u/FollowTheEvidencePls points out, some mechanics just were tuned to be excessively punishing, especially in AQ40 and Naxx.
---
Imagine playing a gnome. Ugh
---
the problem is that goddamn dungeonfinder tool. Difficult heroics worked when you made your own groups. But Cataclysm heroics were a shitshow when you used the dungeonfinder. 
---
Who could've known that when people can get into dungeons without any effort, that they also won't put in any effort in the dungeon itself.
---
I probably will just plug a mouse into my laptop and save the money. It isn't top of the line but ran a P Server fine and it they're teasing the most recent engine that means it'll probably work great. For all us Potato users - the WOD switch to running off the GPU was a godsend.
---
I can't wait for all the crying snowflakes when classic goes live. Hopefully they will all rage quit and go back to retail and leave the server.
---
There’s no duo that has more pvp potential than a holy paladin and a warrior. Paladin has far better survivability than a shaman, better cc, better single target healing, cleanse, and the most important thing is blessing of freedom.
---
Absolutely everybody who has ever heard of World of Warcraft knows Blizzard is remaking Classic, because it has been all over gaming news constantly.
---
Blessing of freedom and a great lay target
---
The story before the wrath is garbage and the story after wrath is garbage. Vanilla has no real story,  its a sandbox RPG where you do some random quests but the world has no story whatsoever except different villains popping out here and there. Tbc was such garbage that they made Illidan into a random villain and the story was so bad that they had to give him a redemption in Legion. Also Kael'thas was one of the Best characters in w3 and he appears as some random boss of a 4-boss raid (and he wasnt even EVIL in the first place). Completely massacred the little boy.
---
View distance rendering is different from zone phasing / sharding as seen in this clip.
---
If it was based on distance the front of mass would have appeared before the back while running. Not a huge pile of people at once based on the zones crossing line..
---
If like to see how the fuck you plan on not going oom. I used to mess around with it in vanilla and the dps was big for 2 min, then I'd wand for 5.
---
The next scheduled stress test.
---
Yes, let's make my 4 button rotation 1 button. What fun and engaging gameplay
---
Flying ruins much more than just PvP.
---
&gt;And melle can hop to your mount and attack you on it with their regular rotation.
---
Yea I cannot see how that's not really really bad design for classes that need to stay at range. Be a mage, have Rogue jump onto your mount, get fucked. Great design. 
---
It's a terrible idea what you're suggesting. Utterly terrible (sorry, bashing the idea, not you). It's SUCH A HUGE change that you cannot possibly gauge the impact it'll have on the game. It's on the same scale of introducing flying in the first place.
---
What do melee mobs or players on the ground do if you attack them from your mount? (locking them in combat and preventing them from mounting up themselves) 
---
What about this anyways, why would anyone ever dismount again? We'd have a game of people flying 95% of the time. And the problem of people nosediving straight onto objectives rather than fighting through the intended route to get to them would not only still be there, but much worse. It would warp the game SO HARD you couldn't even recognize it.
---
&gt;But I always wanted classic wow to be a restart like osrs was. I think this is where the direction of the game should go imo. The best of both worlds.
---
That's the big hope for many of us, assuming we trust Blizzard with identifying what "in the spirit of classic" means for adding new content.
---
Its for the pvp aspect.  The paladin can cleanse away snares and roots from the warrior. 
---
The paladin also has bubbel, and Hand of Sacrificie to pass some of the damage from the warrior to himself - basically making the paladin immune to ANY CC that breaks on damage. And ofc freedom just makes the warrior unstoppable 
---
The shaman sure makes the warrrior have more burst. But WF totem wont do anything when the warrior is sitting in a frost Nova. And you as a shaman have no hard CC. 
---
That Said - its still a brutally good combo both in pvp and pve. So dont be discouraged. Me and a friend planned the same thing but ended up alliance due to other friends preferece.
---
This is because nostcore servers use sharding. Yes, literal sharding. Ironforge is running in a different instance than Dun Morogh.
---
Enhance for leveling until at least 40+. Melee dps scales with the stats you can actually get on lower level gear.
---
Btw I recommend 1h+shield, take the block perk, get shield spikes on your shield when you can. 10% chance when hit to take greatly reduced damage and reflect with spikes
---
The question was not "nelf or dorf". The question was "how useful is shadowmeld in PvP". 
---
Not to mention that in PvP fear ward is not even that big a deal, most of the time it will get purged or the subject will be killed by being sheeped instead.
---
Ill delete tho title is too aggressive its 5 am lol
---
People whine about everything. Give someone a bag of money and they will complain that it costs 10€ to withdraw the bag
---
I would rather have overcrowding to be honest. Dedicated players will be ahead of the curve anyways.
---
I feel like op is either 11 or 50
---
In most cases they do. Its even more idiotic to believe that private server experiences are correct
---
Would this be able to sell for profit when people don’t have much money while leveling?
---
The question has been answered. @2.04 in this link its pretty clear this aint even close to Vanilla WoW. https://youtu.be/t83jrj-WgOA
---
Its funny after all these years even Blizzard can’t make a Blizzlike Vanilla server..
---
In my opinion, Wrath was the end of the Warcraft series.
---
The Burning Legion had mostly been blunted/temporarily defeated in Burning Crusade. All of the Legion's attempts on Azeroth had been massively thwarted. The first Well of Eternity, Warcraft 3's plot, Lich King becoming an independent evil instead of helping the Legion invade, Burning Crusade. The Legion was essentially done.
---
All that was left was the culmination of the story that Warcraft 3/TFT left off with, Arthas and the Lich King. Fighting the Titans and the God's and all that being the chosen one nonsense just became too much.
---
Finally defeating the undead scourge and ridding Azeroth of it's last big-bad evil was the real end of the series.
---
Cataclysm was the beginning of the end of original WOW and the beginning of the lazier cash-grabby casual friendly Blizzard that forgot it's original player base and lost it's way through a myriad of filler story lines and other shit that they used to milk the series dry of all artistry.
---
It's no surprise a ton of players quit between CATA and MOP. Wrath really was the end of the original series story line and everything after IMO is just WOW's swan song that was necessary for Blizzard to keep milking money from the rabid fans.
---
Well I didn't mean your GM personally, but many people with that worry have been throwing vitriol at our community and those can go f themselves, because they're egoistical shits who value their own fun so high that they're willing to deny other people theirs.
---
Tauren Paladin in live called Holycow
---
You mean like it allways was back in the days when something new is released ? 
---
Layering is shit and competition gone. 
---
Please! Don’t change my mind
---
Has it? I almost never see mainstream media covering Classic. And how many average joes that play WoW follow the mainstream gaming news?
---
a new class every second expansion. If they keep it up, next expansion should have a new class
---
Besides front parry % for bosses what have we learned about private vs classic player damage? Main takeaway I’ve seen is that up to the lvl 40 content we can see from beta streams the dungeons are all substantially less difficult than private servers
---
You dumb
---
Are you even from europe ? Because it doesnt seem like you understand how these languages work at at. But il take the bait and explain it to you
---
Yes theres like 50 countries but not every country wants to game in their own language. But there are certain countries with a stereotype that they refuse to speak english ( germany , france and spain as example ) most other countries have a huge english speaking playerbase where its not a problem if they are mixed and matched. But rolling on a german server is like going to a russian server. Not a single word of english will be seen. So yes its not unreasonable to ask for german french and spanish servers because they will choose a server anyway and totally dominate it with that language. So since they already take up a server slot anyway might aswell make it a german/french/spanish server so that new people dont level for nothing on a server where they cant communicate.
---
In that case the answer to "How useful is shadowmeld in PvP" would be "Not very useful, and you have to miss out on better abilities to even use it."
---
I see what u mean here. But for me too much cons. But we should try to get our servers back :D
---
Well im just saying for the first few days because yeah things should be competitive but the first few zones shouldn't be that level of competitiveness
---
shocknorris ;)
---
Why are all of you guys acting like he is the only one that has a say in all of that stuff? Just cause he is lead game designer doesnt mean he can play hitler and decide everything on his own.
---
LETS GO.. im sure we can do it with so many people complaining in forums and other plattforms :D
---
Wow doesn't work like that though. Starting areas don't have their own instance, they're part of each continent as a whole. So one wouldn't be able to just layer the starting zones on their own.
---
Looking at raid in bwl gear half of the players are doing 1000+ dps. That did not happen.
---
From what i see in this thread its completely the other way around. On r/wow there are no posts like "classicf is literally garbage". There are lots of them here in classic wow. Its the classic guys who are hating on everything about retail in a rude way.
---
Agree
---
Forever alone.
---
Lmao i used to play Overwatch daily. Mainly main or offtank in the master bracket. One night i was queuing and this Mercy main in my team asked me if i wanted to queue up together. We joined voice and it was this dude... kinda shy, barely talked but every now and then i could hear a *ugh*. Like not fully moaning but a small *ugh*. 
---
After a few hours i had to leave and after leaving discord he /w me ingame and said "thanks that i could be your little heal slut tonight"
---
Lmaooo didn't knew about "heal sluts" before that but i googled and found that sub. Apperantly some peopel get off of it. I dont swing that way but i didn't mind. I thought it was funny.
---
2000 in Japan, 01 in NA
---
FFXIV uses it on expansion launches and it works okay(-ish, S rank rares are still an issue). Slightly different there because zones have loading screens between them, but if I was implementing it in WoW:
---
Layers are numbered, players are told what layer they are on.
---
You can freely change layer at any innkeeper or meeting stone
---
You can change layer on the spot once/hour by being invited to party, they have to click a button to do this (similar to 'accept summon' and this can not be done in combat or in FFA areas (gurubashi arena).
---
Players are offered to move to a more populated/less populated layer when layers empty/fill up (again, via an 'accept summon'-like window).
---
Its about hate “ no its about not being able to communicate “ no its about hate. 
---
Do you realise why the americans get insulted in this thread ?
---
[x] rekt x2
---
Is this something new added in beta/stresstest? I havn’t seen it before. Then again, I havnet had a keybind for it in years.
---
Welcome to the "I'm not interested in retail anymore" club. It's fun here.
---
I never played with all my friends on the same server because we were split in different language servers dude. We played together later on when they allowed anyone to group up with everyone. Other than that we played tons of games together but not wow. And yes we would speak english all the time with others, but that was never an issue for us, thats how it works in every game we play. We speak in discord whatever we want but we use english to communicate with others. If the servers arent eu wide then everyone will go to the server of their prefered language because of guilds. Thats the only reason, no one cares about speaking english in wow, but they want german or english guilds for raids, and you will never have those 2 types of guilds in the same server unless they are EU wide. And im not close minded at all. I dont care playing on eu wide, english or german servers. But not all my friends are as good at english as i am and while its ok for them to type english they wouldnt want to be in an englksch guild for raids. With split servers i will always have friends in different types of servers, never all in the same, and its nit because of me. I would even play on a portuguese server, my native tongue and i would be willing to play on an italian too because i also speak italian (although im shit at writing it).
---
I say it again, i dont care if they backtrack on it and i just play on a german server because thats where i have most of my friends but you dont get what the issue is here. Not all my friends are willing to play on german realmd and not all are willing to play on english exclusive realms.
---
Looking back tbh, i'd say playing over that period of WoW made me a lot better as a gamer. For the first time I couldn't coast along and perform - I had to come to outside information to help push my game to the next level. This included DPS rotations / cooldown management and developing a bigger understanding of how the game really worked.
---
Could have gotten an NA sub for a month and play
---
Mana cost per second is about the same for AM and FB? The problem of using AM is really the spell power coefficient. AM does not have big dps (in fact ot has really shitty dps exept fpr base dps which is alright). Maybe you had found out something that I don't know or could your memory possibly be decieving you?
---
Good for him
---
Weapon damage/speed is irrelevant to druids melee damage in a form.
---
no thanks
---
Are you suggesting Blizzard isn't going to make the launch day blindingly obvious for anyone currently subscribed?
---
&gt;Having people sit around and spam LFG/LFM in general chat isn't great
---
I created a need to speak and communicate to people, which makes you interact with people and the world. Maybe you add the tank and healer to friends. Maybe you try and make them your friends. Now you have someone to play with.
---
Okay, troll warrior is kinda meta)
---
I added the /s because of the "Who could've known"
---
Anything with healer and a tank is always lovely for dung's... Its not a bad combo, but consider druid and warrior, go feral and arms/fury for leveling... This way you can tank, heal AND dps ALL dungeons in the game, also this way none of you have to suffer yourself for tank/healer build... But if you love shaman and warrior, dont ask anyone, just do it xD.   You can NEVER find the perfect combo
---
Dunno, I doubt they will
---
Yes. 
---
A multitude of reasons.
---
See that's the thing though.
---
Everyone in Vanilla had a specific role to fill to make raids successful. Everyone wasn't just a cookie cutter reskin of the same DPS class. There was no major homogenization of classes.
---
Some classes use a full rotation in raids, others are there specifically for a few key buffs/debuffs like Paladins and Locks. And depending on the raid or other event like PVP or during the leveling experience different aspects of each class really shined.
---
Locks are great for PVE during the leveling experience. But in raids they are not nearly as important but a good 40 man will have at least one lock for their specific needs. PVP they can be a real monster.
---
Paladins on the other hand are just downright awful during the PVE leveling experience unless you've got a duo partner to level with. But in PVE raids Paladin buffs were what gave the Alliance an edge getting raids done over the Horde.
---
This meant that every class you played had a very specific flavor. And you either learned to love that flavor, or you re-rolled your character because if you wanted to raid you had to commit to one or two level 60's and stick with it. This made your class *mean* a lot more to you. And it also meant your talents had a huge impact on what role you played as well.
---
Playing a hunter, rogue, warlock, or a mage, although all DPS, all would be very different experiences depending on whether or not you're raiding, leveling, or pvping. You weren't all just nuking the shit out of everything with your best abilities, you had very specific jobs that were more important than just slamming the boss with as much damage as you can output.
---
In retail WOW Warlocks are basically mage/hunter cross breeds. In Vanilla your debuff is specifically needed, albeit maybe a little repetitive. Point is, your role may be a boring one, but it's an essential one.
---
If after all that, it's still not going to be enjoyable for you, then you need to pick someone else because it's not easy to reroll and max-level someone like it is in retail these days.
---
Can you make one for blizzard loyalists who think classic is made with love and will be perfect?
---
If you break down your complaints the heart of it all is laziness. 
---
I can’t completely blame them. I mean I’m sure most of their good ideas were blown after 2 expansions. 
---
That being said they continued to sell and market the game. 
---
The issue of lfr is one of content. It’s far easier for them to reuse content. Accessibility is just marketing speak. 
---
Same thing with systems. “Oh we can’t continue that system into the next expansion, that’s too much extra content and work.”
---
Wrath was the start of this. The end game content schedule was garbage. Naxx was repurposed content and outside of the two drakes there was not much going on. 
---
Ulduar was like 5 months later or something?  And then what was the delay after that 4 months? Brutal.
---
What have I doooone I've killlllleddd a wabbitt
---
It didn't happen in this circumstance, there is a YouTube link posted multiple times in this thread. At 2.04 you will see clear as day this aint the case.
---
My understanding, and I could be wrong on some or all of it, is the "zoning" you're talking about are used as anti-abuse measures.  To prevent people from hoping layers by simply being invited to a group.  They have to be in the same proximity, or in this case "zone" as the people in the group they joined.  It's just a simple character state check.  
---
Warning, shitty pseudo code incoming:
---
&gt; Group leader X invites character Y.
---
&gt; Group leader X zone = Westfall
---
&gt; Character Y zone = Darkshore
---
&gt; X zone does not = Y zone
---
&gt; no layer hop
---
The interval in which the server checks for this or how it checks I'm unaware of, this was just an "end result example".  The error for not being able to join an instance could just be the layer hop failing and using the term "instance" for lack of a better one and piggy backing off that error since the syntax already exists.  The same error and behavior occurs when you try and join a dungeon and get reverted back to outside the entrance for whatever reason the game has for encountering the error when trying to move a character from the world to the instance/dungeon.
---
I don't doubt Blizzard has the capability of making layering a per-zone application, but I don't think it was built from the start with that intention.
---
Oh look, a screenshot of retail Ironforge ! /s
---
I will go back in time and tell 11 year old me that thanks for the advice
---
Welcome to hell
---
That specc is great, good job man.
---
It will allow you to play ret PVP and ret farming solo (to farm that sweet sweet gold) but also allow you to heal dungeons and the first raids with ease.
---
Bear in mind if you join a strict pve guild they´ll probable ask you to go for a full "holy" build tho! but this is great after you ding 60 to farm and be able to heal etc.
---
No. This is called achievements and we dont care
---
Stupid people more often speal their mind than anyone else, is neither interesting nor entertaining
---
Sums it up perfectly, thanks!
---
There have been tons of solutions proposed by said bitchers. How many choosing your layer when you first log in, and you're locked into that layer unless you relog? How about a cooldown? Only changing it in rested areas?   
---
You are just making up strawmans for some reason lmao
---
This is the best description I've read of how WOW slowly lost it's way.
---
It's kind of like the internet and human socialization. Facebook and other platforms have made communication instant, and easy, and heck you can even facetime or post pictures of what you're doing and all that. No more need to tell people you took a trip to Vegas, they already saw it on your feed.
---
People don't call anymore like they used to, they text, or they don't talk at all. I remember calling friends on the phone to talk or catch up. Now all that catching up happens through facebook and other stuff.
---
In some ways, you gained something. Mainly convenience. But in the long run you also lost something.
---
Bro.. Ive been thinking about the same, and my only conclution is: DONT STRESS xD.    If it was me, i would be getting the ubrs key from lbrs, so i could make some money this way
---
Yes they do. That's why they go noggenfogger or savory delight 24/7. They wanted the racial but they hated the aesthetics.
---
I feel like Spanish without the lisp (i.e. the one spoken in America) is way uglier.
---
Right, nothing I’ve talked about has anything to do with view distance rendering.
---
He’s not in the same spot at all??...
---
Northern Italy was also widely influenced by Ostrogoths. Venetii too. And not to mention they have actual Austrian Germans in their borders.
---
I mean we're all rather polite about battle for azeroth but isn't the story literally Jaina's family doesn't love her go quest to fix it to unlock these reskinned humans? I stopped playing barely into the third level of quests and that's the impression I left with. 
---
Surely they recognize it's crap? Legion was amazing in my eyes. Even silly story Mists had great questing. Even stupid story WOD had fun quests. BFA... I was shocked to find myself so bored.
---
PvPing rankings won’t exist during phase 1, so rank 3 isn’t something a speed runner is going to be able to do as a new 60 until phase 2 launches.
---
I don't think the dungeon finder was the issue for difficulty.
---
I think it was that dungeon finder cam at the end of wrath, where Dungeons could be rushed through. And the än when cata released, that was the expectation for those Dungeons as well.
---
Great post. I think this is the core of everything  wrong with wow retail at the moment. But as you articulate, it goes way beyond that.
---
Except he never zoned in/went inside the gates at that time stamp.
---
Going to be moderately mirthful if layering is disabled after 2-3 weeks having done a wonderful job of smoothing out early levelling and having had a minor impact on late game farming and game play. Seen some crazy angry posts about it.
---
How does it get the data of how many players are online?
---
Trusting Blizzard is a big mistake from my experience.
---
You’d do the same shit anybody else would do as a fresh 60.
---
That's really cool, I don't care
---
May the skulls and girls be plenty, Your grace
---
Never skip lfr day.
---
FARMING SIMULATOR 2019 IS FOR IDIOTS.. I said while quietly playing Crusader Kings 2.
---
Different strokes for different folks.
---
Does anyone know if you do a /who search, will it only find players on your layer, or does it return a list of all players on your entire server?
---
Alliance char named Parts or Investigator. Then get the pvp rank "Private".
---
Gnome called Tripwire.
---
Most people have laughably bad intuition on statistics. Anyone who says they'll immediately be able to tell whethet or not their 2% crit trinket or whatever is missing is just wrong.
---
Each group does not own their own layer, nor is a layer created for each new group that is formed.  Each layer is designed to hold X amount of people.  If you are in a different layer than the person who invites you to a group, you are moved to their layer with everyone else currently in the same layer as them.
---
If you just so happen to be in the same layer as the person who invited you, nothing changes.
---
we hate the game, not the player lol.
---
it's more a case of acknowledging that they listen to good reports, investigate, and respond publicly with openness
---
these are all good things that encourage trust
---
i'm not at all surprised they missed it
---
I mean, they've all been doing it. partially for themselves, partially to show how B.S. and like sharding it truly is.
---
Or, they're not completely sure and are using conservative estimates, so if their expectations are exceeded, they can open more servers, which is great PR. The opposite would happen if they open enough servers to match their high estimates, and then have to shut down servers or merge servers if their expectations aren't matched.
---
It is possible to be a part of several communities at the same time though.
---
It's a meme.  
---
https://invidio.us/watch?v=wb3AFMe2OQY&amp;t=1m51s
---
I didn't need to play Classic again to see what a joke current WoW is. I went back just before Legion. Was rolling through the old world content like it was nothing. World mobs were nothing. Dungeons were nothing - thanks heirlooms which I despised like nothing else. Nothing had meaning, value or purpose anymore. Calling it a bad game is undeserved praise for this pos; it has become an absolute joke. An over-glorified slot machine.
---
I'm watching someone do transmog runs through BWL atm. A place like BWL was this end goal for me in the early days of WoW. It had this sense of mystique. It was this high-end, exclusive place that I aspired to be able to see and experience for myself. And here was are, seeing all those legendary encounters be mindlessly one shot by a solo priest. That's just emblematic of what the game is these days. Everything's been devalued to the point of pointlessness.
---
They destroyed this game through years of terrible choices and turned it into a game for lazy babies. There's no saving current WoW as it stands and I don't want anything to do with it. I want another team to start again with WoW classic and to keep it alive moving forward by eventually releasing the newer content, retuned to work with, and be faithful to, the older game systems. I hope this happens but if not then WoW classic will just be last last hurrah for me and then I'll be done for good.
---
They kited some dragon on the beta so hopefully no leash.
---
Yet others are supposed to care about what you think looks "insecure" or "turns people away from the community"?
---
It was super late in the expansion with TBC talents so maybe that was it.
---
That comment totally read as "Exactly, I like WoW Vanilla and some like WoW Dogpoop" LOL
---
Not classic but terryworgan always made me laugh.
---
pffff..... are people that find fart jokes funny.
---
No, that's not the right block and yes, that vanish is just the spray paint tool.
---
Where did blizzard touch you?
---
Blizzard is the only winner in this “battle”.
---
Not having played retail WoW now in almost five years, I forgot which expansion I simply said... "No, thanks..." -- I'm using the "free-to-play-to-level-20" option to test out my new rig and monitor.  I wanted to make sure my FPS was good for those ol' time raids.  :)
---
Realizing that all of the starting zones are now different, and that I've only played Alliance twice on a private server -- I wanted to get a feel for the retail dungeons, the different classes, etc.  As I was questing out in the Barrens, (North) -- a young paladin came up to me and said...  "Are you okay, you're not using any heirlooms..."  And I had to laugh because as a hunter I was two-or-three shotting NPC's that would have taken me far longer to kill, and my "focus" or whatever was immediately restored.
---
My little priest could heal RFC in all grays and still have mana.  Ditto for healing DM and even then, not winning a new staff on the boss kill.
---
My mage of any talent spec could one or two-shot equally leveled NPC's and more.
---
My monk leveled the fastest simply running around the starting zone and riding on carts.
---
However, I still suggest that even when "classic" comes back out that WoW makes the dungeons as close to original as they can so that dungeons and raids are not one-trick ponies and cleared in less than a week.
---
Folks are gonna hurt when they realize that they need to know their class, both offense and defensive skills.  I remember well when mages were torn to shreds for not being able to time their silence on the battle mages in Live Strath and when those NPC's could mean immediate death for one of the players.
---
And the sad thing?  I don't want to level past 20 in retail WoW.  No one talks, even in dungeons except when they try to insult each other and/or get huffy and leave.
---
I remember when we finally cleared LBRS as a five-man when the spiders were not nurfed, when the fire orcs were still one-shotting players -- it was the absolute best feeling.
---
It was "hard-mode" for dungeons.
---
And sadly, it's never going to be recreated, not even in the new Classic release.
---
Thank you for the insight
---
1.12 fixed DM farming. There's a huge elite blocking the path.
---
Lol, bruh. If you think tanks and healers are going to be easier to find than DPS I've got a condo in the middle of the Atlantic ocean to sell you.
---
Nearly a million people disagree with you so not sure what to tell ya bud. His job is to entertain people. One way in which he does this is by offering his opinion in entertaining ways. He wouldn’t be where he is today if he just sat there and played WoW without talking. If you don’t like it, just don’t watch. Or you can choose to waste the limited time you have on this Earth complaining about it to strangers on the internet. Your choice.
---
Personally I don't know nor have I seen anyone with this opinion. I mean yeah, classic wow is going to largely fizzle out once the content is consumed, but that's any game. People are already talking about classic TBC and at least those people are honest enough to look past the hype and look to the future.
---
Keys / attainments seem like good ideas, noted. Ty
---
Be aimed at people's alts
---
I've seen this video before I saw porn
---
I respect opinions, but my perspective is like “woah” to this opinion. I was like a kid in a candy store when Demon Hunters were announced, and they first demo’d double jumping. It’s hard to imagine people not caring a bit.
---
speedrun is relativ, maybe he starts in phase 2 and still rushes to 60 ;)
---
Oh okay! I got you, that makes alot of sence! :D
---
Good cause it's fuqqing shite!
---
He is on the other side clearly looking at people halfway INTO IF..
---
Your just looking at the other side of the window buddy.
---
This is the sort of thing that has me worried. Tiny little things that almost nobody would notice are wrong/different. This is why backporting your game is a bad idea.
---
Yes, just enough for the abusers to get a monopoly on the whole AH.
---
&gt;	From the only other game that’s comparable to Classic WoW, Old School Runescape’s 2013 release, which saw over 40,000 people on launch day, down to under 15,000 a few months later.
---
Which now has over 100k during peak hours, and average 50k online?  
---
http://www.misplaceditems.com/rs_tools/graph/
---
Not a very good comparison there, as it proves the opposite of what you said.
---
While true, OP specifically says speed running on release though.  So phase 2 relativity isn’t relevant in this discussion.
---
Can’t get polymorphed if you have brokentooth and are out of range. :)
---
It happened very early in Vanilla. I was on Silvermoon EU, and before BWL came out, realm transfers opened up for our server, and 3-4 of the best guilds left. It happened at least another twice to Silvermoon EU in Vanilla.
---
Can you not see people on the other side though?  If you can't see the correlation between the YT clip and OPs clip i'm done playing ELI5
---
The PvE realm is way worse, around 100-130 per faction lol.
---
I really don't know why they only invited such a small amount of players to the realms.
---
Are you accounting for 100% uptime on world buffs/obscure consumes that those numbers come from? Vast vast vast vast majority of numbers from vanilla come from players/guilds that had nowhere near the buff stacking. 15% melee haste, 140 AP, 5% melee crit. Just from orgrimmar raid buffs.
---
 I am not saying you are wrong, I’m saying an apples to apples comparison, of the type you suggest BWL dps numbers are, does not exist.
---
oh, seems i skiped over that part
---
my bad
---
That’s cause r/wow is mostly art and posts about leveling or should I get back into wow or complaints about allied race grinds. Any mention of classic and the same vitriol exists. Obviously classic peeps hate retail with all the changes their game was destroyed and people were douches about it forever.
---
It’s just the truth.  The game isn’t different for a speed runner, they just play it for longer periods of time and try to do available content in an efficient manner.  It’s still the same available content.
---
We came so close to having the bard class 
---
https://i.redd.it/xtxzokv4rop21.jpg
---
Monk wasn’t OP to my knowledge. So that’s something.
---
Humans in general are toxic creatures. Blame society and capitalism for creating a society of psychopaths who only care about them self.
---
How is shadowmeld not very useful in PvP exactly?
---
We will see soon enough I suppose. I don't think those buffs give a 100% damage increase.
---
Yes, in crowded areas it took several seconds to load up the other player characters.
---
Oh god, I actually remember that.  He's not even exaggerating...
---
1.12 macros are more ridiculous than that.
---
For example, a tank warrior is usually trying to use his abilities via a pretty clear priority system like 99% of the time. This means you can just make a macro like
---
/cast Revenge  
---
/cast Shield Slam  
---
/cast Sunder Armor [well, actually /script KLHTM_Sunder() to make it work with KTM]   
---
and this will do most of the work for you. It is not optimal because sometimes you want to get sunders up quickly or maybe you want to wait a split second for 1 more rage, but for most cases this will do your basic rotation near perfectly, giving you time to focus on stuff like positioning.
---
If you add the Supermacro addon to this you can actually get really deep into writing a script that does nearly all of the work.  
---
It is actually pretty ridiculous what the macros and addons in the 1.12 client can do. From what little I have read into modern WoW macros those seem way more limiting.
---
We didn't have dedicated language specific servers in vanilla why would we have them now?  
---
What we had in vanilla was through time same players from same countries would migrate to the same server. So making the first " dedicated language/national servers". Some bought the transfer, some just leveled up a new character. Now classic will last to the end of time and if you accidentally made a character to the wrong server and don't want to pay 15€, or whatever, to switch a server why not just level up a new character?
---
Blizzard stated that they would release classic servers way in advance so players can pick a server in which they want to play. So why won't people choose a server which they will make their "language dedicated server" national server.
---
When the serverlist is published just make a forumpost which server you're going to pick. OR see if someone else has made same specific post and follow them.
---
Best warlock name i ever saw was Harrydoter

Think you missed the part where I said I don't care
---
Paladin called Famostvchef, never did find out if it's true or not

---
Insta kick/leave.
---
I really disagree strongly with this. I don’t think anyone intended to make the game worse, but that’s what accidentally happened through many small changes which accrued into a transformation of what the game was. Death from a thousand cuts. Just a small thing like item level. On the face of it, yes it’s good to know how good something is immediately, but the downside: everyone only looks at the darn item level, when deciding what to equip and even more grimly, who to group with. Instead of bring the player, not the class, now we have, bring the item level, not the player. This is just one example. There are hundreds.
---
I think the reason the game is bad is precisely because things are now so easy, it satisfies no one. See the post above about deferred gratification. When everything is epic nothing is epic. When everyone is epic, no one is epic.
---
US Realm people get upset when they queue with someone from Ragnaros or Queldorei, imagine being forced to be on the same server.
---
You just combined 2 images form xkcd and added wow. Fuck you.
---
I think if they implemented the current version of group finder(not to be confused with LFD, which is the spawn of devil that came in patch 3.3) instead of the auto-queue LFD, it would have been a very nice compromise between the automatic queuing and lessening the "LFM Nexus HC" spam that leaders had to do, since all you have to do now is choose the dungeon/activity, queue up and wait for other people to discover your group and sign-up with their role and a small note.
---
TL;DR there were german and french servers.
---
That egg timer thing resonates with me so much. I really despise dailies and dread each reset where I would have to log in and knock  out another set again so I can hit exalted with X faction. I never had that feeling grinding Timbermaw Hold rep or Frostsaber rep. They were just simple grind mobs as much as you want for as long as you want whenever you want. Some nights I'd spend an hour on it before I hit a wall and some nights I was in the zone and go till 3 AM. Whatever mood I was in I never dreaded login in. I personally think that a more free form structure for grinding reps, currencies, or other super grindy content would be better than dailies or weeklies. Keep those for raid related activities which naturally have a weekly cycle.
---
Binging? Wow...that's..dont see that a lot
---
I do appreciate that fact that, even today, a lot of young folks from developed countries still don't know English or simply don't want to bother with it. It's   baffling to me, but that's like trying to force me to learn Dutch; yeah, no.
---
The problem is that most of us with basic understanding of English want to go on a server where we would preferably be able to communicate with at least 90% of the population there. In order for that to happen, it needs to be done through English since it's pretty much the universal language. 
---
As someone who lives in the EU and have lived/visited other EU countries, I really don't want to have the language barrier forced upon me in a goddamn video game. 
---
This would effectively segregate most of the EU community, but let's face it, it's all an illusion anyway. Take a 150 mile trip to your nearest border and you're already in a foreign land which has nothing in common with yours, speaks an otherworldly language and doesn't really want to bother with you. 
---
All I want is to pick a realm which is labeled "English" and where preferably most of the population would be willing to use English as a primary communication tool.
---
Europe?
---
Hey leveling with full boa gear was challenging... when you literally pulled the entire instance (at your level) to the boss and aoe'd it down. 
---
Jk it was still stupid easy.
---
Why would you want to ruin the game for not just the streamer, but everyone watching his stream? 
---
All they want to do is play and stream the game they'be been waiting for for 14 years, but if people like you start to hunt them down and ruin their fun, because no one is going to have fun when the 10th big battle has started in 1 week. What you're doing is going to deter them from streaming the game so that they can avoid toxic people like you,  and just get to play the game they want. 
---
If you hate streamers so much that you have to form raids to ruin their fun and the thousands of people watching, because lets be honest you're an attention whore so you wont bother with streamers below 1k viewers because they wont be able to get enough backup and you wont get enough attention. Just leave their server alone, they'll probably all go play on the same 5 servers and youll know 2 weeks before the release which server they will play on, so just play on the 20 other servers.
---
There a lot more than a million stupid people in the world, it doesn't really mean anything to the rest.
---
There’s no way they can fix it. If people can’t hop layers by grouping people will be furious, jf people can hop layers and escape from pvp people will be upset aswell.
---
Layering is just sharding without the crossrealm part.
---
it would've been the same if dungeonfinder came in BC. The simple truth is that many players didn't do heroics in BC. Blizzard made them easier in Wrath to get more people into that content. And even then there were still a lot of players who still didn't go heroics, so they made the 1-click LFG tool and that pushed so many new players into that content because the barrier to entry was lowered significantly.
---
It's not that the expectations were low, it's that the kind of players you find in LFG/LFR don't go into higher difficulty content. Maybe it's because of some social anxiety or some other reason, but many players who use these features don't seek out groups to tackle harder group content. And because they never do that, they never get better at the game.
---
So you wont get annoyed after being camped by 10 people everytime you log in?
---
These names made my day
---
lol, nope, fuck europe.
---
You didnt make this comic. You just stole one and changed the first line. #Originalcontent
---
He are talking in dungeons, not pvp
---
the issue is if they are keeping it changed for this reason or for any reason and they want to mention this as well, they need to come out and say so.  They won't.
---
Incorrect, I bring anecdotal proof #1:
---
Name:McNanners
---
Level: 4 
---
Area: Dun Morogh
---
Age: 21
---
WoW Exp: MoP-BFA
---
McNanners travers to the troll cave in the starting zone, within 30 seconds of entering the cave, he dies due to body pulling. Minutes later after corpse running, resets to the beginning and tries again. It took Nanners half a dozen deaths atleast, much swearing on voice comms, with lines such as:  
---
"I'm going to do this!", "I cant give up", "No I don't need help, I'll figure it out", "Maybe I can go the other way in the cave".
---
Listening to his strife in a level 4 cave, and determination to carry on was inspiring. After finishing the cave: "I've had more fun here, than I have in any BFA content"
---
In my defense, Warcraft 3 &amp; Frozen Throne
---
I ain't gonna be raiding at 03:00 in the morning, thank you very much but no.
---
Bingeing? Its a weird word to spell
---
It makes for like a 4% DPS difference or something, so probably not.
---
Well the ooga gang is something else, what they do is art. They come in, gank the streamer, get their laughs and then leave instantly. Where as the spergs who is going to be stream sniping the streamers will only leave when more people come and kill them or if the streamer kills them repeatedly
---
I plan to roll a Night Elf Warrior and tank raids. I used to tank with a Orc Warrior and a BE Paladin on the Horde back in the day but this time around my friends want to go Alliance.
---
So I'm going to be a motherfucking Night Elf Tank Warrior.
---
Everyone tells me I need to play a human and I understand all the racial reasons why Human sword bonus is better than the Night Elf dodge mechanic and shadow meld.
---
But have you seen those tiger mounts? How about the Night Elf being the biggest Alliance race and looking like a *motherfucking beast* in heavy plate?
---
I also absolutely love shadowmeld in PVP or just avoiding getting killed afking while leveling.
---
I really hope it wont make anyone pass me up for raids since I am a pretty kick-ass tank. But I'm concerned people are going to treat me like I didn't know Night Elf was not the 100% optimal choice or use that as a reason to complain about my tanking even if my tanking is fine.
---
But I intend to roll a Human Mage Alt.
---
I don't really want to have a main tank human and a human mage alt. How boring would that be?
---
Out of curiosity where are you getting the numbers to compare from? I’m interested in taking a look at different classes vanilla/pserver. And I agree we will see soon enough how things shape up. Although soon could come a bit faster :)
---
If there would be more people from EU, then there wont be a raiding time difference, since we are all from EU ?
---
To be fair they missed 5 out of 10 times.
---
Everyone wanna be a rogue, yes you will struggle.. Its always been like this in classic, tho i have seen a big downgrade on rogues on private servers, i think people have learned their lesson, but private servers is for a special core, when classic releases and alot of newbies is gonna join, i bet you that 50% will pick a rogue, just like in 2004
---
He was op af in mop
---
i prefer retail over classic, classic just gets boring after a few minutes imo. i cant sit for hours playing classic, which i can do with retail
---
What is the name of the song playing?
---
I cant answer that, as the server was never even close to naxx-geared at any point during retail Vanilla. 
---
We had 2 guilds that cleared the place and I would guess around another 5 that made it past the entry bosses. And this was considered a pretty advanced pve realm. 
---
But of course that meant that the pvp grps that was usually gathered from some of best geared pve-players regularly clashed. As any sort of organized pvp will tell you, your odds of surviving is based on a team effort. I never really played distinct support speccs, since being able to pump a lot of healing was my main task, usually by babysitting the FC. Pure support is rarely worth it in BGs in my opinion due to low uptime and lack of synergy on debuffs. 
---
If you are honestly neck and neck with the 2, I would go priest main and rogue alt for farming etc. Priest is considered a stronger leveler than rogue anyway and especially as dwarf, your friends list will fill up in no time. Rogues are way more gear dependant and unless you are ahead of the leveling curve, will be hard pressed to find groups in comparison.
---
That was their original plan before they changed over to layering.
---
my view is one of two possibilities - 
---
1) they did find the 1.12 database (they had previously said they did not have it), and either are inclined to soften up classic (tuning it easier makes it more accessible) or are really that early in the test phase they didn't catch all this stuff
---
2) they used a later database (2.3 or later) which had had substantial nerfs to certain content.  Someone has mentioned that classic dungeons feel like the difficulty they gave in 3.x, for example. (which is a pretty damning statement considering how many player buffs had taken place by then, as well as dungeon nerfs).
---
Hopefully everyone can see why they would never admit they used a later database version as their template.
---
I guess you didn't play a rogue then 😂
---
Was his name Zack?
---
Battleshout does not generate threat on Beta.
---
Oh shut up please. You don't understand one thing about running a multi-billion dollar company.
---
Warlocks can definitely AoE grind, just not in the conventional sense. Its more of a DoT up - Void Aggro - Dot Up - Void Aggro - til you have 3-4 mobs and then drain life / health funnel / refresh dots.
---
With that and life tap you can go on almost infinitely
---
Won't layering only be in the game for the first couple weeks?
---
Hi man
---
my guild &lt;TRASH&gt; are in need of active players in general - we will be raiding one weekday (based on the schedule of other players) and running 1 optional saturday run per week. Hit me up on [https://trashguild.com/](https://trashguild.com/) if you are interested!
---
Cheers
---
Friend was looking at a stream and noticed something weird with meters. 1000+ in bwl with appropriate gear was something that did not happen at the time. There was a huge deal when a decimation warrior broke 1000 dps with the best gear on the planet with every buff known to man back in naxx

I'd much rather go 21/30/0 and take 5/5 Spiritual Guidance over Spirit of Redemption. Lightwell in its Classic implementation is useless and even the Spirit is mighty overrated IMO

So everyone you ever met IRL is your friend?
---
You're still being absurd.
---
Enh in Wrath was a different beast!
---
At least we don't fuck ourselfs &lt;3

One million and one if you include yourself. Just because something doesn’t appeal to you but it does to others they are all stupid. Cool, got it.

Remove kebab.

It would affect BG queues

I sincerely hope that you are correct.
---
But not all keys, only the ubrs key will be important, if you are among the powerlevelers to hit 60 first.. You will make a ton of gold on the ubrs key, since no one have it, and everyone wanna go ubrs... Ive done this, and you can easily make 50-100 g in an houer, (not killing any mobs), also the fire potion recipe drops in lbrs...  I m going to run a 5-man grp with irl friends, and as soon as we ding 57-58, we are gonna spam run lbrs,  we discussed this alot, and it seems to the the best gold making oppotunity at the very release.. Gl bro :)
---
We've tested layering and found it to be garbage.
---
1-20 is all about the wand baby. Wand spec means it does heaps of damage!
---
Am not sure about this. Mc was tough as fuck with shit itemsation when your tank hp bounced. Later with some bwl gear it was a loot pinata
---
No it's stupid because it's stupid. How many religious people are out there? Billions?
---
Look at that, a german server!
---
I feel exactly the same. Great post.
---
Ha, no. Adding everyone you ever meet in WoW as a friend was *your* absurd idea. No one does that.

---
All they have to do is, after the last content phase is released, they announce TBC servers. There, people are hyped and will continue to play till TBC, some stay in vanilla, some move on, some new players join because TBC was their favourite and didn't like vanilla.
---
Classic has a lot more of a longterm plan than OSRS did. OSRS had everything unlocked at the start and the team focused mostly on bug fixes for the first month or two. Classic has a +3 month beta phase where they iron out the biggest bugs, and then they focus on polishing the next set of content, not only raids, but all of the possible quests, systems(honor system in phase 2) and items that will be released with the new phase.
---
Blizzard already has their content plan ahead of them, and players feel like "new" content is coming their way every 4-6 months, even if they know what it is, they will cherish it when it finally comes(particularly the Honor system, before Honor system, it's a lawless world out there).
---
I don't think they will be so many players.
---
Looking back, the small number of loot drops made the game longer which I think was a good thing
---
hi again  - just a data point observation follow-up.  one data point proves nothing but I found this one interesting.
---
you may have seen the yellow attack normalization values being by about 10%, using much later values (current engine values I think, though I donn't recall when those were changed).
---
I have coded and well understand a reference value can get stuck somewhere unexpected when you think it has been removed.  I certainly don't know if the legion database values are still present anywhere in their build, though.
---
I think it is notable that the correct vanilla values were publicly known, and thus it was possible to demonstrate beyond statistical doubt that the beta is wrong.  most areas of doubt do not have public hard numbers to compare against.  I question whether a vague 'is yellow attack normalization' complaint would have gotten the same prompt attention and correction.
---
Or have mass shootings
---
These buffs are huge and the boss damage is buffed on pservers its gonna be easy as fuck in classic
---
god forbid someone avoids being harassed.
---
Can I be a slut too :D
---
The DW ready stance looks retarded
---
So many inconveniences and bugs. I bet many will be ignored and carried over to release.
---
Do a flip.
---
Which is exactly what I said?
---
&gt; People fail to realize that there are people out there who love walking simulators, Farming Simulator, The Sims and other games that are unbearably boring and stupid to me.
---
"Just because I think these games are stupid doesn't mean there aren't people who enjoy them."

YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVEN'T SEEN TANARIS IN MAX GRAPHICS!

The only time this will ever be a problem is level 60 PVP/Raiding.
---
If you are level 60 on any race/class within the first couple months of the game you're going to be head and shoulders above most players and it wont matter how oversaturated your class/race combo is because there is not likely to be a ton of 60's, let alone competent players, around for 40-man raids and PVP guilds.
---
If you reach 60 in a reasonable time and can play the role you're filling with some competency you'll find a place.
---
You'd be amazed how many people never reach 60, or reach 60 and can't play their class well, or reach 60 and then spend all day running around doing nothing but showing off their mount and helping low-levels get shit done.
---
The amount of people who will be leveling to 60, pvping/raiding and doing it with some skill will not be a huge percentage of the population.
---
If end-game content like PVPing and raiding are your aim, then I wouldn't worry much because just getting to the end-game is an accomplishment on it's own and usually will earn you the chance to get into a guild that can find a place for you.
---
The people saying #nochanges dont realize that there were in-fact DE and FR servers back in vanilla.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Server:Dalaran_Europe
---
French only server that was opened in EU launch.

https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Server:Alleria_Europe

Well, point by point, Battle Shout is better. However, you cannot spam BS for threat gen, unless everyone in party is canceling their BS, every GCD. That is a stretch for most players. And your BS only affects 5 players.
---
Demo Shout on the other hand can be spammed without any member doing an additional action, and doesn't have any limit on targets. You can Demo Shout ANY number of targets, be it 1 or 1 billion.
---
However, as a Warrior (which is the best single and AoE tank in Vanilla), you will NOT AoE tank just using your skills (Tab Sundering, Cleave, Thunderclap, Demo Shout). You will use Oil of Immolation. You will use Dragon Breath Chilli. You will use crystals. And Shield Spikes. And most important, you will use Goblin Sapper Charges.
---
But, even without the use of AoE consumables, a cycle of Charge &gt;Thunderclap &gt; Bloodrage &gt; Demo Shout &gt; Tab Sundering &gt; Cleave &gt; 2nd Demo shout is MORE than enough. You might lose threat on a target, but usually that target is a non-elite, and it will be half dead anyway.
---
Warrior AoE tanking in Vanilla is not hard, because most AoE pulls are non-elite mobs. When there are elite pulls...your group will CC 1 or 2. 
---
With AoE consumables, Warrior AoE tanking is a breeze.
---
It was crazy good for pumping out those first 10 15 levels cause fiery lasted for a while, and was on the cheaper end. Crusader was good for leveling too.
---
Exactly... so if there was only English servers again there would be no difference
---
Devilsaur, rotus!

This reads like /r iamverybadass honestly.

Amused by the censored part of chat considering the resolution is so bad after all the JPEG-ing that its unreadable anyways
---
Dude u really make me wanna play it right now! Fuckin shit cant wait for release.
---
Iirc Spanish and Russian ones might have been introduced with the TBC pre-patch
---
And yet I get down voted. I don't care whether or not I get into the beta, but the more people around the world that get invited, the better it will be for testing.
---
LUL
---
If you play anything else other than Nelf yes, because you need to learn how to ride a cat.
---
depends on the role. Every time they add a new tank they're fucking terrible for at least one expac. (for all the people who are going to comment about how their unholy DK tank was great in WOLK, it wasn't great to heal you. It wasn't great at all.)

Assuming that blizzard could put 10fps cap on the game and there was literally no way for people to get around it, no I don't think they should. Capping the framerate like that, while an accurate experience to what some people had during vanilla is, unreasonable because it would kill the game for most people in a way that spell batching, leeway, and the debuff slot limit don't. Capping the frame rate is in another ball park compared to those other things in terms of how much it negatively impacts gameplay. On top of that batching, leeway, and debuff limits can be viewed as gameplay mechanics and were all added to the game during classic, so they fit within the mind set of no changes while still being reasonable, limiting the framerate fits into none of those 3 categories.
---
I am a happy european. Thank god i was born and raised here and not in the US.
---
&gt;Not a very good comparison there, as it proves the opposite of what you said.
---
It doesn't prove the opposite of what I said unless you misunderstood what I said.
---
It does have some niche uses. Nobody said it was useless and that you should never take it.
---
Very important. Otherwise multiplying by speed doesn’t make sense and makes your units (damage^2)/sec which makes even less sense than a random 14
---
Streamers weren't banned in Vanilla, that would be a change.
---
I hope this happens to me so I can take advantage of farming spots and getting rare pets
---
I did play back in vanilla although i dinged 60 4 months before tbc release and besides for leveling i dont have much experience of vanilla. But TBC continued on same principles so i am familiar with "classic" wow.
---
Some time ago a friend of mine called me to play on a private server. I was not convinced to play. I was thinking that things cannoy be the same again. We were young back then, noobs, everybody was noob, it was my first MMO, blah blah blah.
---
I logged in and... success. I felt the same excitement for my first green item as i did back then. I talked with people, grouped with people, got my first blue and was super happy! 
---
Its not nostalgia, its game design. Period.
---
Good times.
---
You know, I sat on that beach -- as my alliance paladin -- fishing with my grandmother's Tauren Elemental shaman.
---
She's passed away, but had two accounts, with a hunter on the alliance side, and the tauren on the horde.
---
Seeing that picture kinda made me mist up a little. My grandmother's passed.. but I'll remember that. Forever.
---
BfA is a watered down, soulless husk. It isn't WoW anymore. There is nothing to look forward to, nothing gets better, and even the leveling experience is a horrific grind. 
---
Play Elder Scrolls online. It's fun, challenging, engaging and has a ton of content. 
---
I'm looking forward to Classic but if I'm honest, I dont even want to give Blizzard my money at this stage because they dont deserve it.
---
To be fair, it's english that's close to Scandinavian languages and not the other way around. Also, English has a much Latin influence as it has germanic.
---
No it doesn't. Go away.
---
Not much
---
Then let them. Given an even spread, english will still be the main language and they'll be the ones missing out.
---
Judging by this video from 2006 [https://youtu.be/t83jrj-WgOA](https://youtu.be/t83jrj-WgOA) (2:04), I think you're correct. It might have been added in WoTLK when they started experimenting with sharding.
---
Please Tanknoob; tell us how you run your multi-billion dollar company.
---
Retail is like playing GTA with cheats on. It's extremely fun for an hour, and then your mind is plunged from way high up, down to a hopeless abyss. Nothing there to see or feel. You're numb. No satisfaction.
---
Another analogy that fits well, Retail wow is endless servings of cake. You can only eat so many slices before you get sick and fat. Retail wow is a slow-cooked stew served over a bed of fluffy rice. Loaded with flavor, heartiness &amp; long-lasting nourishment.
---
Damn. I was already convinced they wouldn't cheap out on us like that.
---
Different type of toxicity, but given my experience on pservers, the lead up to November 2020 will be.....unbearable....
---
Slightly, but BG's still have reputation, HK's and gear to obtain from. It's not like a massive majority will be doing arena. 
---
It will also take a lot of the extreme tryhards out of casual BG's, so you're welcome for that.
---

ehhh, half half !

Pvp players vs pve playerd
---
I remember telling my Dad about this and he asked me what date it was
---
I would imagine they kept them on the same servers as the rest of the continent at least until they changed their infrastructure and got rid of the old server blades. After that WoW has been running ~in the cloud~ AFAIK.
---
YO THANKS FOR THE 500 BUCKS MAN
---
That's literally the issue. It's about servers that will be dominated by a separate language that you could unwillingly join and waste time playing on to find out endgame is capped by a language barrier. What they have to do is make a few servers that are dedicated to separate languages, or since they anticipate specific numbers based off of previous installments of the game, make some of the servers they're already planning on releasing dedicated to specific languages.
---
They're catering to casual women. SJW infestation occurs in all fields of prominence. Instead of catering to women who actually, you know, like gaming...
---
I started in tbc alliance and only heard "vc" recently as well
---
go get shot in a school
---
Blizzard gets people to quit classic because they come back and it worse quality than a private server because it has layering, now not as many players so no need for layering. 400 iq.
---
Retail WoW is a classic, pristine demonstration of the adage: "Be careful what you wish for". The players, and many Devs, all wanted each singular introduction of convenience features. But, together with the totality of time, it ruined the game.
---
We got what we wanted, and now we have no soul left.
---
Yeah, I wanna know if us Oceanians get our own server, fuck-all of us can speak English.
---
Here I was, an European, being glad that we wouldn't really have to worry about streamer servers, unlike the people in the US.
---
Then this shit happens. I guess we needed some server drama too to balance it all out.
---
I would say that in EU you should be able to expect that an English server's PRIMARY language was english, with small sub-communities that speak their own language but can still do relatively well language wise in an international dungeon group.
---
yeah ok buddy. let me know how you feel when you've actually leveled a bit. im trying to dictate whats fun for anyone, the fact that you even think that speaks volumes of how self centered you are.
---
Any vanilla hunter know how tanky hunter pet gets? Do they become gimps after raiding since they dont scale or are they fine?
---
Im at a lost for words...everyday the Internet amazes me.
---
I don’t want any expansion material because I don’t believe they have the capacity to make material in the true spirit of classic anymore. 
---
Those devs are long gone and they took the vision with them.
---
That's true, but I feel like you can't say that it does not hae any negative impact whatsoever. 
---
Although ultimately it would be interesting to have vanilla go the same path as OSRS (If they choose not to progress to TBC etc), where they would do community votes for new ideas.

&gt; We're still in beta, Blizzard is still working things out and they need us to voice our concerns, but these things take time to implement changes for. Don't give up faith in the classic team, they listened before so there's no reason to believe they won't listen again 
---
BfA players : "We're still in beta".
---
WoW players : "Blizzard is still working things out".
---
Blizzard : "Things take time to implement changes for".
---
You : "Don't give up faith in the classic team, they listened before so there's no reason to believe they won't listen again".
---
Well, I reject the "we're still in beta" which implies, basically "shut the fuck up and wait for launch". I won't to this. Yes, Blizzard is working things out, but when they come with EU realms being international, that is stupidity, and have nothing to do with working.
---
Ofc, things that time to implement changes for...but we can SPEED up this process by expressing our concerns as often as possible, and as loud as possible, until the change is done...PROPERLY.
---
I HAD faith in the Classic team...but it was over when they clearly assume that Classic will fail (not offering realms for Germany, means that the German speakers cannot fill up a realm, hence, less than 100k player will play Classic in EU, in Blizzard's opinion) and the ONLY way for them to regain my faith is to quickly fiz this stupid decision of EU realms structure.
---
When they will do it, will be the point when I believe that they listen us again.
---
I havent said that the story was perfect, but you could still relate to the world and the story you've been told in warcraft games. The only relatable thing in the new games was the burning legion.

Good riddance. Have fun over there

I have a list, gonna create each class and see how many I can get at launch
---
The problem lies much deeper. What you've said is absolutelty true. But adding to that is a huge drop in world cohesion because everything is queued and done from the main city. It just doesn't feel like an immersive MMO world anymore. And that's a core problem that came with all the "convenience" features.

You have no idea how much I want an 'Old School WoW' - it's the only reason I really care for playing classic.

There are serious issues with classic a lot of the community are repressing, and will definitely be fundamental to the games longevity based on how reactive blizzard are at creating a better game after Naxx.

Where have they said that? Are you referring to the video where they specifically say it CAN'T be active when P2 launches?

I'll probably be the only openly trans tank around
---
This is gonna hurt.
---
1. No level 1 players, no. Go to where the max level cap is. It has been like this since Wrath tbh.
---
2. 15 years of gear will do that transmog aside. Pretty unrealistic that they would stop making sets after vanilla. BG's are there and you can queue for low level dungeons but you're right, its not the same and there really isn't much point till max level (don't ever queue at max level, its trash gear with really bad players).
---
3. Yep
---
4. There really isnt one on classic leveling. Its sort of a tutorial on how to hit your buttons. Retail leveling is only enjoyed by a very small crowd. 
---
If you like raiding and m+ then yes, it gets much much better. PvP I cant really speak to. Casual content is in a pretty bad place right now (hence the "fuck BFA" you see all the time) but the high level content is enjoyed by a lot of people. Finding a decent guild opens up the game completely. Chat isn't a huge thing anymore because the people who socialize tend to do it on discord. If you are someone who basically has to be forced into groups instead of seeking out a guild then you will probably have a bad time. I typically recommend that someone uses the boost before they quite completely (if they have BFA), espcially now that 8.2 is dropping. Your call.
---
There is no evidence of that at all but sure
---
This. So hard this. I wanted to make a meme about how much shit EU was giving NA for having to deal with streamers and then this shit drops and now we all get to freak out. Anyways best of luck dude

I'm pretty sure Shadowmeld added +1 to stealth level in Vanilla so for Rogue and Druid it improves their stealth so thats cool.

There's a reason so few guilds cleared AQ40 and even less cleared Naxx. It took extraordinary team work and communication to get anything done in classic WoW. There was weeks of wiping on Ragnaros getting everyone their fire resist gear up, then personally my guild spent 2 and a half months wiping on Firemaw in BWL because you had to get 40 cloaks for everyone, then there was everyone building up nature resist gear for Princess Hurehan in AQ40 which had your leather workers and blacksmiths going all out and if you were skilled enough to be in an elite guild you got passed 4 Horseman in Naxx and needed a crapton of frost resist for Sapphiron. It wasn't a perfect system but it was challenging and fun.

Sounds pretty selfish to me that you dont want people to have their own servers that they had for a long time just because they didnt have them in classic.

Yeah, I played many classes but never Demon Hunter and only tried DK once, I thought it was dumb.
---
Yes, there might be a drop-off after launch, but osrs as you mentioned is not proof, it's just one game, that is not enough for making an accurate analysis. 
---
And even if it did do the same, player population rose back up again, and even surpassed launch numbers. Which would clearly require them to reactivate layering to handle the load. Or they would have to add more servers which they don't seem to want to do.

Yeah, forgot that, shadow is OP for leveling on pvp server

---
Such a great writeup and so many good points!     
---
My favorite sentence:  "The danger of pulling more than one mob gives the world a real sense of adventure, forcing me to try to use every ability I have." One of my favorite part of Classic WoW, is to face hardships and try to maximize the use of my spells and abilities. This is also why I always recommend my fellow players to get all their skills and abilities while they level up and learn how to use them in that process. This is why leveling your own char was so important in Vanilla, and not get boosted / carried or level so fast that your don't have time to learn to use abilities (retail). You could easily spot players at level 60 who bought a characters. In retail WoW, this would hardly make a difference.

That's Jennifer Hepler, formerly of Bioware, though it's apparent that Blizzard was infected with that mentality. The more I think of it, the more I think (to John Staat's consternation) that Rob Pardo had a big role in ruining WoW. Everything that got casualized that is public seemed to flow through him. 
---
This "accessible for all" mentality pervades the scene, she was just one of the few people to admit it. She actually left Bioware in 2013, which is a shame since she was a good writer.

The community has been split for years, as many people have been desperate to play wow, like me. We come back every expansion hoping things will be different, then quit without whining after 2-3 months. We've been playing on private realms for years now, I personally don't think many BFA players will last in Classic, it will likely bore them on the route to 60. Most wow players that started in WotLK+ will not know what that level 30-40 mountain is like.

Thanks for bringing this up again, hopefully blizzard will see it this time.

Yeah this is a weird fucking post.

There language dedicated servers on Vanilla launch. Seems like a lot of people are arguing for no changes yet seem to have no clue what Vanilla was like...
---
I really don't mind speaking english. But I have travelled a lot in Europe and I know that in some areas english just isn't spoken by a lot of people. I feel like putting them all together is gonna be a bad experience for all of us. Those who don't speak english because they're gonna feel alienated and those who do because they have to deal with people eho can barely communicate.
---
&gt; And im not close minded at all 
---
I never said that. I said their explanation is: While it has advantages for a minority like you and your friends it has huge drawbacks in terms of realm community.
---
&gt; ...you dont get what the issue is here. Not all my friends are willing to play on german realmd and not all are willing to play on english exclusive realms. 
---
I do get what the problem is and I answered to it. Again: I think your point is valid but it is only reasonable for such a small part of the whole WoW community that it should not overcome the different experience it will create on Classic WoW servers in comparison to Vanilla WoW servers. 99% of the server speaking the same language was a part of the Vanilla WoW experience. The idea that everybody has to speak english is good, but it won't happen as you already can see in reddit and as you already stated yourself. So basically there will be clusters on one realm. And that is simply not the original WoW experience. Not to mention there is the problem that players not reading reddit/the boards might land on a server where 70-80% of the players do not speak their language and where the players refuse to speak english.
---
I loved Burning Crusade so much. By that point I finally understood my character (I only played in Vanilla for 6-8 months before BC hit) and had an amazing guild and group of friends. Running heroics was my favorite part of the game. I definitely got in to raiding too but something about having an experienced team of 5 friends that worked well together was the height of bliss for me. Those were the folks that ran heroic Shadow Labyrinth with me over and over again til I got my Sonic Spear in my hunter. Just hours and hours of camaraderie and increasingly hilarious jokes as we all complained about having to spend so much time in this insanely hard dungeon but loving it anyway. And Karazhan is still my favorite raid to this day - always had a preference for 10 man raids.
---
Wrath was fine in my opinion but I quit during it. Tried to come back in Cata and hated it. Dipped my toe in once more very briefly in Legion and that was it for me.
---
tl:dr; BC was great and felt like an actual evolution of vanilla. I wish they’d add it to classic eventually.
---
Have to agree with this. I’m going to be jumping between both versions of the game which I imagine will be quite a popular way of doing it but I defiantly see more hate on here for retail. That original posters cartoon could quite easily also apply to the reverse situation.
---
&gt;Which would clearly require them to reactivate layering to handle the load. Or they would have to add more servers which they don't seem to want to do.
---
You've completely misunderstood the discussions around layering vs more servers.
---
The reason why layering is the preferred option vs more servers at launch is because the launch population is *temporary*. It's going to spike up, but it's also going to come way back down. 
---
As you say, there is not enough information to make an accurate analysis, so they're not exactly sure where the post-launch population will drop to. 
---
It's much, much worse to have too many servers than to have not enough, so the layering is their solution to avoid opening too many servers.
---
This is completely irrelevant to the choice of whether to open new servers later on, months down the line, because the population later on will grow steadily and isn't going to have any unexpected sudden drops, so if the population growth keeps going, they don't reactivate layering, they open more servers.
---

DK tanks took almost no dmg. Our raid strat was if dk tank died, our warrior "tank" taunted long enough to brez dk, then dk proceeded to tank everything since the warrior was a pancake.
---

---
Yea, what are these people smoking
---
As a NA player, I actually welcome this. I've made some terrific friendships with people overseas. Generally because of my lack of a decent sleep schedule I spend all night playing and I always enjoy finding people from the EU I can get to know. Hopefully a solution is created and it makes it easier for all of us to enjoy the servers, but worst case scenario, you'll have people welcoming you
---
To be fair, neither is very organic but a streamer causing it most definitely isn't.
---
Thanks :-)

I’ve been reading your guide - impressive work man! Got a question you might have a good idea about: If I wanna roll UD/Troll mage, but do all Thunderbluff quests to get that sweet kodo mount - how much rep will that end up leaving me to runecloth turn ins? I know you focus on Alliance, but thought you could give a more competent answer than most. 
---
Hope you got some insight in that matter 😊
---
+ nice comment @fluke
---
I don't think people are ignoring it as much as they don't have faith in their words. 
---
They are doing well for most stuff regarding classic so I hope they stay true for what they say about layering as well.
---
But they did say that sharding, when it was added in WoD, that it would only be used sparingly and for extreme cases.
---
But it's used everywhere and as much they can.
---
I will be Priest, my main class that I've always played as. Might not be the best to kill enemies quickly, but it's what I will play, and have for 15 years.

---
Really though, it's not some life philosophy.  It's that I think the "100% no layers or else" guys, are in large, retarded.
---
They have fixed the issue with LFD with mythic+ , if people want a challenge it is there for them. however far too many want their preferred play style forced upon everyone else.    
---
People tend to only focus on current content near the end of the patch and expansions when players are usually by then geared beyond the content's designed levels. Now where I think they blew it was with scaling, instead of making the outside world challenging it made it tedious. When all zones are the equivalent there is no sense of accomplishment of earning your way from one to next.   
---
What LFD did not do but the development team did do was to reduce lower level dungeons to LFR equivalents. They did this because to the developers only the current expansion really mattered. Heirlooms for the longest time were simply granting to strong which further made a mockery of these instances. They partially fixed heirlooms but the lower level instances are pretty much devoid of threat. 
---
There is nothing inherently wrong with LFD but it does stand room for improvement. One can hope that if classic catches on that they make less tweaks to game play as expansions are layered in or that they go a different direction entirely. beyond classic the only real need would be a bit more tuning to insure that there are no dead specs. I really hope they don't trap classic to be entirely what vanilla was because truth be told, too many are wearing rose colored glasses. It was fun compared to the competition but it really needed class tuning
---
Of course it's a Night Elf Huntard ninja looting the hat
---
At this point Idk if you are trolling or just dense so I'll explain it to you...  
---
When certain amount of people is reached, other people on the server will be phased into a new empty world (aka layer)... They won't be able to see the rest of the people on the server... It will be desolate for them which is totally ruins feeling of playing an mmo... Imagine walking into a capitol city and seeing like 35 people around you when on another main layer there are like 450... This applies to every zone... There are countless ways this can get in the way... From seeing someone getting phased in front of you, to looking for an enemy only to realize he must be phased, missing out on some type of random event or gathering (wanna duel in front of Orgrimmar, too bad for ya bruh)... It makes your server feel artificial and breaks immersion...  
---
It doesn't have anything in common with one big fat ass server where everyone is on the same terms...
---
Sorry OP, unfortunately this is not the beta

I could only imagine the fucking shitstorm here if people couldn't log in and be one of the streamers was in game playing.
---
The fact that they are against rp realms, certain language realms in europe, and the fact that they're insisting on using systems like layering.
---
I assume you mean classic wow at the beginning of the last sentence?
---
I agree. If most of the community doesnt want international servers they should backtrack on it 100%.
---
I don't think you can *realistically* play both Classic and Retail at the same time and enjoy both. You just can't. One is a '70s muscle car that's difficult to handle, has a shitload of power for its time and is not appreciated by much, but still gives you possibly the most authentic experience of that era. Compared to a modern muscle car, again, with a lot of power, but very subdued, very calculated, assisted in every way imaginable and overly used. There's little character to find in that one, even if it adds some sense of fun.

It's amazing how these systems designed around player retention statistics just end up burning players out.
---
It never stops with just that one thing either, because people will just log in for that one thing then they're gone. Rather than remove it, they just keep adding more and more timer based bullshit until it's so much that it **will** burn you out having so much to do, every day, if you at all care about progressing your character, and then they don't even have the decency to have a clear finish line for that awful grind because of things like titanforging obscuring that finish line.
---
But sure, keep saying it's so you feel excited occasionally when that piece of loot titanforged. It couldn't be something so cynical as to encourage you to keep running lower difficulty content to pump that player retention stat! 
---
You know what's exciting? Getting the loot you wanted and knowing you got **it**. Not a version of the item, but the item as it is for everyone else.
---
Yeah same here. Pretty out of order for Blizz to tease like this imho
---
A simple calculus based on German speaking players (20% of the EU) leads to a worrisome conclusion : Blizzard is expecting Classic to be a MAJOR FLOP.
---
If 20% of the EU players CANNOT fill up a Classic realm...this basically means that EU will get 5 realms. Which, considering Vanilla realm population (12k total players, 3k concurrent players), Blizzard is expecting that only 60k players will stay on Classic after the tourist wave.
---
Even if we TRIPLE this number (because if you do a German based realm, you have to offer 3 options :  PvP, PvE and RP), we are still looking at 180k player for Classic, in the EU, after the tourist wave is gone.
---
Blizzard is assuming that Classic EU realms, at launch, will have between 60k and 180k RETURNING WoW players (that will play long term) and over 1 million EU retail players, that will quit in 1-2 weeks.
---
Worldwide (NA, EU and Asia+Oce), Blizzard is expecting between 180k and 540k returning WoW players for Classic.
---
I don't know, but for me, these numbers are ridiculously LOW. When you have like 130 million people that played WoW since 2005, to expect around 500k or even LESS than that, to return for Classic is borderline insane.
---
Not even ONE PERCENT of those 130 million? SERIOUSLY, BLIZZARD? NOT EVEN ONE PERCENT ?
---
I have no idea what analysts are at Blizzard, but they are either dumb as a rock, or on meth all day long.
---
Dude this is so well said it’s nuts.

Because I choose to have some faith in the Classic team. They've shown us how hard they're working and how dedicated they are to giving us an authentic experience. They deserve some trust for that. If they prove me wrong, fine, I'll move along to another game. Until then, I'm not going to be running around looking for things to be pessimistic about because "hurdur blizz sux amiright?".
---
Why people feel the need to speak about things they know nothing about?
---
Time to RP entirely with emotes
---
In all seriousness, I hope there is a solution because you have a great point. This will hurt those interested in RPing in the EU
---
I hear you.  I usually just have a recurring six monthly subscription these days and check it out when I feel into it.  This last two classic stress tests have been the most fun I've had in the game since TBC.
---
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Classic ruined the entire game for me. I have no interest in playing a 15 year old game.
---
The fact they put so much focus on bringing it back has taken away important resources from BfA, making it worse.
---
Before they focus on the ACTUAL game, I have no plan on coming back.
---
&gt;Go warlock. Never share your healthstones.
---
I'd probably kick people for this.
---
With how things are currently looking it'd appear that anyone who isn't mainland NA is getting fucked over.
---
yes, there are **some** people blowing up layering. we're talking 1% of the community. a very loud minority. nobody cares anymore
---
New and scary different things always get a ton of negative attention and when you have a group of people literally clawing their faces off for any piece of classic juicy tidbits, things generally take a turn for the worst. 
---
I also personally thing things are overblown. But, on Reddit I've learned a squeaky wheel gets the grease.
---
&gt;and the fact that they're insisting on using systems like layering.
---
Come on man, use your brain, this is obvious if you've followed literally any MMO launch ever. 
---
The population at the launch of an MMO is *temporary*, you can't open more servers to handle it because when the population shrinks back down you are left with too many servers. 
---
Having too many servers is a big problem, and servers can't easily be removed once they're added. Layers, however, can easily be added and removed.
---
The population later on will grow steadily and isn't going to have any unexpected sudden drops, so if the population growth keeps going, they don't reactivate layering, they open more servers.
---
Thanks for clearing this out, also approx. how many layers are there and how did the guy who invited him  seemingly know they are not in the same layer, did he just speculate or is a distance / location also a factor here?
---
Blizz know you cant launch Classic without layering.  If its only the first 2 weeks, then let them go ahead and get it beta tested..
---
It's the thought that counts :p
---
Demon hunters were shit for most of Legion, though. Atleast in PvP.
---
Zzzzzzzzzzzz... Obviously no point playing.
---
I'll take it that you're trolling. Ofc there were dedicated servers back in vanilla.
---
The problem with unofficial language dedicated servers is that you will have people who have no clue what language will mainly be spoken. By the time they realize this, it might be too late to roll somewhere else and will have to adapt. This just an unnecessary mess. 
---
So why not just give official servers sorted by language? I just can't believe there won't be enough German, Spanish, Italian and French speaking people to sustain at least 1 pvp 1 pve and 1 rp Server.
---
Does this mean, that I can play Classic with a controller?
---
The plan is to *reduce* the crush, not remove it completely. Seeing as each layer is the size of a 2004 server, yes, it'll still be chaos, but fairly authentic chaos. Layering (if it even ends up working) will mean that there's 600 people in Northshire, not 2400.
---
&gt; having so much to do, every day, if you at all care about progressing your character
---
This burned me out so much in Legion...
---
Farm dinos for a week.

---
Maybe you should’ve checked then
---
I know why they choose layering. But I am also of the opinion that they should merge servers instead, should population decline, or servers not having enough population even with layering (Which might happen).
---
Because there are literally more than 50 posts about this exact thing on this subreddit and it has been going for days - no you don't deserve an answer if everyone has been asking the same shit for a long time. The answer is there, even the broken reddit search would help you in that case
---
Woah, I'm a 'wannabe' sculptor in 28mm, and I'm impressed with the level of detail in the sculpt, and pretty good proportions man. Awesome job.
---
Need to cycle through people in the beta, if you're not actively testing make room for someone else
---
Russians are getting servers tho (thank fuck)
---
I think I'd take this over layering abuse at this point.
---
I unsubbed from the subreddit weeks ago after seeing how moronic the threads and discussions got. Streamer/layering/retail hate is just exhausting to see, and it's such an echochamber you can never bring other perspective into the discussion because they don't want to listen.
---
I visit now from time to time, like observing in a zoo.
---
It not pride. It's 101 business.
---
Blizzard will HAVE to, first, explain a lot of things. Secondly, can you imagine the MMORPG market reactions when Classic blows out of the water EVERY SINGLE MMORPG out there, Retail WoW included?
---
Third, Blizzard will HAVE to start develop NEW content for Classic on top of TBC, and they will have to restructure the Retail WoW as well.
---
It's not about pride. It's about the impact of a 15 year old MMORPG on Blizzard.
---
And that impact, believe it or not, will be HUGE.
---
Most people still don't realize what is coming, for Blizzard, for WoW and for MMORPGs in general.
---
Everyone is expecting a small number of Classic players...but they are wrong. It will be a TSUNAMI. people like me that expect 5-6 millions or more players to return to WoW for Classic, are considered crazy.
---
Will see about that.
---
In about 2 months.
---
The food analogy is solid. 
---
Another comparison is travel. Pleasant to take a relaxing, all-inclusive vacation on a cruise ship, pampered for a week, but what do you take from the experience? What remains a year later? Contrast that with a solo train-trip through unfamiliar territory or an arduous backpack trip into the mountains. On those kinds of trips you're using your head to survive, making connections with people, deeply immersed into the experience. I have more distinct memories from a backpacking trip I took in the 90s than from Vegas a few years ago.
---
All of those "solutions" or band-aid fixes over layering that all come with their own problems.
---
Locked to a layer unless I relog? Okay so now I just relog to hop layers? How is that a solution.
---
Cooldown to hop layers? You mean a cooldown on joining a group to get my bracers enchanted, and then another cooldown when I wanna group with a different guy to sell something? Pretty awful "solution" they would probably impact more players than later abuse it's attempting to prevent.
---
Only changing in rested areas?  So you wanna inconvenience everyone trying to play the game legitimately? Awesome solution.
---
Every "solution" that gets proposed is terrible.  Here's the only "solution" we should be talking about: have layering for launch, and get it out of the game ASAP.  Anyone abusing it to the point that they are massively fucking up the balance of the server can be banned by blizzard.  Why are people acting as if everyone is just gonna be able to exploit and get away with it? Once we are passed launch population stress layering can be removed, and any exploiters banned.
---
Reputation gain is much lower in Classic than on private servers. If you want the best chance at getting exalted with Darnassus before reaching level 60, then you might consider a quest completionist approach that gets you all of the Darnassus quests in addition to spillover Darnassus rep from all of the other Alliance faction quests:

---
Thank you for this well written comment, u/itchy_bitchy
---
That’s still going to be absolute chaos
---
I'd guess it's due to changing zones. You can't look ahead into another zone before you're in it yourself. Not due to layering. If he'd been invited into a group and it happened, it would have been layering. Switching zones isn't the same as switching layers.
---
Huh? I’m not making a statement on anything, I’m asking about the mechanics
---
They will immerse themselves more fully in the RP then ever before. 
---
The French will only play Trolls and Gnomes
---
The Germans will only play Undead and Gnomes
---
The English will play Humans and Orcs
---
The Spanish will play Night Elves and Taurens.
---
The Italians dont get to play sorry, it doesnt work in my race structure ):
---
There will be a real language barrier to simulate the language barrier amongst the races. In this RP world no one has yet to learn each other's languages. 
---
ezpz
---
You played a game you dislike for 10 years? Fuck.
---
I can see I'm dealing with a very intelligent person.
---
It was specifically Kazz that was leashed. Maybe a few others i don't remember. Kazz had this nasty habbit of showing up at Stormwind a lot.
---
Please point me towards anything official stating that they'll fill up each layer to the brink.
---
You have no idea what layering is judging by that answer.
---
It could be argued that there are different languages from different areas of the populace.
---
Local Languages etc.
---
Though my biggest concern will be from phase 2 and beyond. With the shrink of the total online population will cause further issues.
---
Aim for 6 months.  
---
Layering should be used in the first week only and be disabled after level 10 or 15.  "It doesn't work that way". Then they need to fix it and this is the entire point of the beta; to find these problems and improve the experience.
---
I personally think the game isn't as crowded as everyone thinks it is. After the first few levels everyone spreads out exponentially. I just think it's idiotic to not merge whatever servers "die". A lot of beta players have already experienced being on a "dead" layer. Layering is pretty lame right now and they need to change it.
---
I'm not in beta so I can't comment on the overall pop there. However, I was in the stress test, and this is how Classic 12 felt the entire time up until the last few minutes when they collapsed the realms to a single layer each. Then it went from feeling like wtf nobody showed up to holy crap this place is packed.
---
Honestly that was the most striking thing to me about the stress test was how it felt like nobody showed up and the world was completely empty. Other than the throngs around Northshire chapel right at the start, there were very few people anywhere else in the world. But based on the mobs that were there once the layers collapsed, this seems to have been mainly due to players being spread over too many layers.
---
It wasn't unplayable or anything, and I was still able to fine onesy twosey random groups in most areas that I played. And the timing of this last stress test pretty much guaranteed the lowest possible turnout on the days and times it ran. But it was clear if you were there at the last few minutes there were loads more players around, you just weren't seeing them because layering.
---
I'm not saying "layering is bad" and I don't think it shouldn't be used. It's certainly necessary as a way to deal with the initial population surge without crippling loads of overprovisioned realms within weeks when it crashes out. Overall it's actually a good and elegant solution, and needed. But the way it was tuned for this last stress test was not great and made it feel like they made a game and nobody showed up. If it's tuned similarly for launch, it's going to make a really poor impression.
---
But I assume part of what they were testing was to see how few is too few and to see if the servers can maintain the number of layers they estimate will be needed at launch even knowing they would not be packed. And obviously they have the capability to expand and collapse them at will to deal with numbers present on the fly, as they demonstrated at the end of the stress test.
---
And the classic wow model in front
---
There's a Classic WoW launch coming up, a few people around here are a bit excited about it.
---
Let's be honest BFA is done for might as well just wait till classic is finished and the next expansion goes into development
---
Layers are a dynamic system and there is no strict rule saying each one needs to have 3k on it. Layers are more like a dimmer switch. 
---
My guess is the starting zones are going to be hea ily layered and those layers will start to merge as people start to spread into different zones.
---
Awesome! And do you mean beat by just the amo ui not of players or the enemies? But yeah that's a similar idea and glad ya wanna be part of it!
---
You tottally missed the point tho mate, people will get classic, and classic could be around for years, but if they could add some new content once the majority of the main player base has burnt out etc they could really take it in an even better direction than retail but still maintaining the classic vibe, no level increases just stronger raids, stronger bosses, more story, events, addition to builds or some more balancing 
---
I dunno, I think everyone is in denial that people won't get burnt out; but they will at some point haha, as wicked as it is it would be nice to follow on the classic setting with some xtra stuff YEARS down the line
---
kek
---
Ye hes been maturer for years... just go watch his streams from like 2014 or something (when his hair was pink or white) and youll see a world of difference in his toxicity.
---
Some say classic brought back the old soda, i guess but i havent watched him much back in the day and tbh ive only watched like one of the first classic streams he did.
---
Asmon is more interesting when it comes to classic, he does more events and im sure you know his way with speeches... its funny at times.
---
Some of their roles seem to be more like characters rather than just themselves talking to a mic. Its like comparing tyler to soda. Theres a clear difference when someone is playing an obnoxious character and when they are simply a streamer - themself.
---
ps. all streamers have a role of some sort. Cant be successfull without one, but in most cases its just themselves being more vocal. (imagine standing behind them while they stream - they talk alone in a room) ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I've never played on a pirate server as I see it waste of time and unsafe. Didn't wanna take the risk of having my hard work deleted for some reason, like whoever runs them one day just decide to shut down the servers.
---
There's no rush in getting exalted with Darnassus as I only need to be exalted to ride the mount, which will be at least two months after I'm level 60.
---
Demons can't be sapped, they can be blinded however.

PIN NUMBER

That’s the whole point of stress testing and tweaking layering. 15k players on 5 layers is 3k per layer. Yes. But it’s also 2142 per 7 layers, 1875 per 8 layers, 1666 per 9 and 1500 per 10.
---
&gt;According to Ian in an interview phase 2 is not going to have layering, at all, that was a statement and they tend to keep it.
---
they also gave a reason why layering *literally can't* exist in phase 2.  world bosses.  which is obviously just a throwaway fake reason to put some weight behind their promise to get people to trust it
---
Exactly! He’s obviously an old player that wants attention
---
Welcome to the real world... what's left of it..
---
We will all RP in English.
---
Add RP-PvP to it as well :)
---
No.  In real vanilla each continent was one whole zone.  You didn’t notice any phasing or loading anywhere inside a continent unless you went into an instance portal.
---
Also blizz specifically said that layering was supposed to stop this from happening so assume they’ll be patching it at some point.
---
I would rather play on US instead and deal with streamers imho
---
Monks were super underwhelming when they first came out. WW was meh, MW was OP but was nerfed and did not see any real play until BfA after the initial nerf(their mastery sucked ass for the longest time). BrM started okay but became the best tank in the later tiers of MoP and best utility with kiting adds shenanigans.
---
DH started out pretty okay as well, the DPS spec was really good in dungeons, and pretty good in raids as well until they nerfed the Bleed talents after first tier. The Tank spec has never really seen much play, it has been a pretty massive flop, it has always been either "meh" or bad.
---
Well...they still DO actually have the correct numbers...and they are TESTING them, to see if the game is properly tunned.
---
When it's not...they FIX it. But the numbers they have ARE CORRECT, it's just that the Classic is built on LEGION client, and beta is for TESTING.
---
Ofc that there will be wrong interactions, because of the infrastructure, and it will show wrong numbers...but this is why beta is for : to ADJUST the numbers properly to their CORRECT value...which Blizzard HAVE.
---
He's absolutely right that it is the beginning of the end of your enjoyment of the game. The only step that is missing between you minmaxing with an egg timer mechanic and you completely quitting the game is the realization that you are only playing for the timed reward and nothing else. Once you realize that it's only that reward that makes you login, you won't login anymore.
---
That's how it went with Hearthstone for me. For a long time I only played to do the dailies and then logged off again. Once I realized that I only played for the dailies and that I didn't really have fun anymore outside of the dailies, I just completely stopped playing Hearthstone.
---
Edgy
---
I’d think English would be humans and undead. German would be orcs and dwarves.
---
Former Greymane player here as well! /wave
---
You are misremembering.  In real vanilla the entire world was seen less. You’d only see people loading in/out at max range for you to see them.
---
He was agreeing with you while also making a joke. No need to assume everyone on Reddit is trying to contradict you.
---
Because every time they add a new class it's ~~retardedly op.~~ melee.
---
I feel like you dont know what spell batching is.
---
I hope they would do that for starting zones, however they’ve said nothing about it and nothing has been tested like that in beta yet
---
We know it wouldn't be unplayable because we've played on overpopulated realms on launch day. Yes it's very crowded and yes you can't complete every quest but it only takes about an extra hour to hit L5/10 and after that it's fine.
---
There was nowhere that this happened in vanilla.  You’re thinking about wrath.
---
No you wouldn’t
---
What are you talking about dude? Of course you can see into another zone, that’s the most wrong thing I’ve read today on this subreddit.
---
Considering everyone with a sub can reserve names 2 weeks prior to release, I'm guessing zero.
---
To be honest, you can solve this problem just by using language separated chat channels (as in LOTRO for example). Since Blizzard uses layering for the first few months, they could combine this technology in order to ensure, that certain communities stay together and always have enough people to play with. Kind of like the mega servers in ESO.
---
I don't think #nochanges applies here that well. I do remember how people built their reputations on certain servers in Vanilla. But times have changes and the majority of people doesn't care about your shiny gear in IF/ORG anymore. The only ones  who do care, are those going for R14. But most of us will not play the game for the first time, the virginity is gone (I play vanilla private servers since 2011). 
---
If we really want #nochnages, we all should get a memory reset to 2004/2005. Otherwise there are no technical reasons to have a server structure like back in the days.
---
Well class design is much better  now or maybe it was best in wotlk rather than vanilla. Vanilla has plethora of dead specs and downtime. Also revamped zones in cataclysm are really good. Ofc you experience it at level 1-60. So it’s not so black and white. Classic for most people is new and wow. Has a massive fad factor. I think it is a difference game but for me 3.1 so wotlk ulduar patch was the best this game was ever. I know everyone has his moments but for me personally  first yog kill was so much better than anything except maybe feeling of elitism after killing few bosses in old nax. 
---
I think world buff farming will wear down people faster than they think but having classic around will be good. It will be another game to play meantime regular patch cycle downtime.
---
This is what happens when you put the RPG back in MMORPG.
---
The sound of children crying is found within the post.
---
According to the vanilla client database the shield from flame wrath scales with spelldamage btw (but I checked 3 release ago). Nothing else to add though.
---
&gt;You could have a macro that will use either Charge or Intercept in a single button press depending on the situation.  
---
&gt;/cast [harm, nocombat, nostance:1] Battle Stance; [harm, nocombat, stance:1] Charge
---
&gt;/cast [harm, combat, nostance:3] Berserker Stance; [harm, combat, stance:3] Intercept
---
That macro is actually kinda bad tbh. It's certainly not good for PvP.
---
It happens VERY often that a warrior is spamming Charge while waiting to get out of combat. You can't do that with this macro. But what's even worse, is that if you press it during combat, while waiting to get out of combat to Charge, it puts you in Berserker Stance. And you don't want that.
---
You also can't pre-emptively put yourself in Battle Stance to get ready for the Charge when out of combat.
---
So, worst case scenario for this macro is that you press it too soon while still in combat, you get put in Berserker Stance. Then you get out of combat, and the macro puts you in Battle Stance again (you should never have gone into Berserker Stance in the first place). And then finally it uses Charge, after 2 wasted stance dances wasting time rage.
---
It's probably fine for PvE though.
---
Yeah, I remember stepping into Vanilla for the first time on my uncle's pc while I was visiting him. The amazement of my first time adventuring through Azeroth as an orc warrior in the barrens for a week. Never to return until I had made an account in 2009, when I played WotLK. Sadly, the memories and the hope for classic wow in August has made it very difficult for me to play retail. It hasn't been the same adventure as it was back then, never will be.
---
&gt; That something this important could have gone completely unnoticed all the way to Kel'thuzad 
---
I am sorry...WHAT? 
---
The Vanilla numbers WERE CORRECT.
---
The Classic WoW beta numbers ARE NOT, because of the Legion client.
---
Did you just ASSUMED that killing KT in Vanilla in 2006, was on a BETA from 2019, built on a LEGION CLIENT from 2017?
---
Way to go Blizzard ! You just discovered time travel !
---
1 and 2 are correct.
---
3 is stupidly WRONG.
---
I wish Warlocks were that easy to play but they are definitely not.
---
Damn dude that is so sick
---
We've been saying it for years, and people have just rolled their eyes. Welcome to the fold!
---
I've been engaging in conversations about Vanilla and sometimes supporting an option for a Legacy/Classic/Vanilla server since 2011 on the retail forums, mmo-champion, and reddit and have usually received negative replies. You are probably not the only person who has not seen this kind of stuff but that is probably because you were not involved.
---
Hey cunts, I made a community discord server for the Oceanic PvP realm once it gets released. If you're planning on rolling PvP in the region give it a join:  [https://discord.gg/Be682x6](https://discord.gg/Be682x6)
---
It is layering.  View distance draw would see you loading a few people nearer to you and then the others further away as you walked forward. Here they clearly all load as you walk past a threshold where you are being put on their layer.
---
hahaha you guys complain, try playing wow in Africa 😂
---
It appears your dialect causes you to spell dwarf and human slightly more different than is standard.   ;)
---
Merges are an absolute mess, are you ready to give up all your names because someone else already has them in the other server
---
Still better this for a few weeks than a launch just like during stress tests.
---
As someone who played during the stress test, I spent 20 minutes just looking for Mangy Nightsabers. 
---
I would prefer they double the spawn rate of mobs for the zones 1-40 and let things balance out after that.
---
I always liked the Gnome puns 
---
Executie was always my favorite.
---
Yesh
---
more like a normal life in the US
---
A lot of us English speakers are thinking about playing in NA servers now.  We’re still hopeful that blizz will walk back on this terrible idea though.
---
I recently started playing vanilla on a private server to prepare for Classic and it's interesting to get "addicted" again. Getting this feeling to *want* to play. I *want* to login and keep playing my characters. I don't even know what I'm going to do when I login, but I want to play. It's so different from retail WoW where you feel obligated to log in because you have to do X, Y and Z.
---
One of my friends is still a clicker, literally has always been. I started playing WoW years after him, yet I have a keybind for literally every spell slot on the bars. Including the secondary and tertiary alternate bars. I use macros, spend lots of time perfecting my UI to my preference. Strafe mobs, do all the shit every player should leatn to do. Yet he has the most ridiculous setup, clicks, fuckin never pays attention - yet somehow he's still a god at the game...
---
You will only be able to reserve 3 names per subscription. So it wont be that hard to get an unique name.
---
Very good points that I hadn’t considered! Thanks for the input!
---
I guess the best approach will be to just expose them to the old and the new and see what sticks, and let them fall in love with whatever it may be.
---
Somewhere on the scale of zero to fuckall.
---
Where are you getting 6k peaks?
---
A unique name sure. A common pun name that everyone knows about? Impossible.
---
STV chat is good too, big zone with wide level range.
---
The correct form is to go into shadow form after you've killed the last boss of the dungeon.
---
But we already have all the [vanilla icons](https://puu.sh/DJhfR/0390f908d8.png), why would you want the BFA design on a Classic discord?
---
They literally had 48 hours of testing just for different layering settings.
---
But just think of all the fresh bread you no longer have to share
---

It certainly makes it more difficult to test dungeons and group quests, because it’s that much harder to find and make groups. I’ve been slowly making my way through the Beta, testing every single Alliance quest as I update my quest completionist guide (https://shadowpanther.net/questing.htm) and there are some quests that I simply cannot test because I can’t find a group. It took me two nights to make a Stockades group and I had to give up altogether on trying to get into Wailing Caverns and Blackfathom Deeps to complete those quests.
---
Laughs in oceanic

IMO it kinda sucks until shadowform
---
You'd be surprised how many people don't speak or refuse to speak English.
---
It's easy to make changes in a complex code base.
---
What's hard is making sure it all works afterwards.
---
.mmmmmmm
---
That hasn't happened on lh k1 k2 k3 or morthdale you're being dramatic.
---
Sounds reasonable, I'm getting tired of all the "if we assume 8 layers and 25k pop on each server"  topics. We don't really know how it's going to be, but they want to avoid starting areas being crowed, så stuffing each layer with a full server pop doesn't sound right.
---
This.
---
I may have been a little over the top with my comment.  More humour than actual plan. 
---
I want to share my old stuff and I hope they like it. But I will not force them to graduate thru my collection of course. 
---
Like another person commented, new generations connect in new ways and old dad will have to realize that.  I just hope they can appreciate some of the old, mixed with new.
---
I hope you roll a char on a server that turns 90% italien after two months.
---
But they already said no layering in phase 2, so crisis averted yes?
---
That's not an Australian that's a Shammy

That seems really boring.

To be honest it really started with Super Nintendo amd the ability to save games. Thats when the rot started to creep in.
---
This 100% won't remain the only major bug to be revealed until classic release.
---
Never played on private servers, yet leveled 4 different classes to max lvl back in Vanilla pre patch 1.9(naxxramas) and the damage dealt by elite in SFK, RFD and SM is handsintofire too low.
---
Either there's another hidden bug or patch 1.12 nerfed those dungeons into the ground.
---
Can't wait to be proven right.
---
I didn't mean "in general", I meant in this instance and probably more. That would explain the behavior. Layering wouldn't since that's not how layering works.
---
No matter what multiplayer game i play, there's always german and swedish in chat, no exceptions.

Stories like this remind me of me, quiting an MMORPG, where I invested 2 years, for Vanilla WoW. I was extremely skeptical and 100% sure that there was no other game that could possibly make me decide to throw away 2 years of my life.
---
How wrong I was...
---
Anyway, this will happen with Retail player in a MASSIVE proportion. Classic WoW is just too damn good and highly addictive, and in 2019, it will run so much smoother. Many people stopped playing Vanilla because high latency and crap machines.
---
**Everyone is "Meh, I'll try Classic for a couple days, but I will 100% go back to retail".**
---
They have NO IDEA...
---
I don't believe you if you're saying that you know the reason behind this. 
---
It has been shown countless times that people trying to deduce Blizzard's reasoning are never right.
---
I remember earth shocking to pull one guy off my tank during big pulls
---
Agree that they would pick the flow of least resistance, but if people didnt have a choise i think they would just adapt to english pritty much... Ive been working and traveling different places in europe, i realy didnt meet alot of people that didnt speak english (this is real life people, NOT gamers)... Dunno, its easy for me to say since i understand english :P
---
Kazzak should be leashed on 1.12. He was on classic back in the day anyway, I was one of those bastard hunters that liked randomly kiting mobs around.
---
Interestingly the mobs near Kazzak, felguards and felhunters and the like, all have linked aggro so you can actually kite 2/3 Felguards at once, but they're quick so you better have improved Cheetah.
---
Well they've also added Blood Elves, Draenei, Worgen, Goblins, Pandaren, and now six new Allied Races. So yeah it can feel like there's a lot more options than there really is.
---
I'd disagree entirely with that. People in r/wow still shit on Classic. And trade chat on some servers isn't any better. I stg its argued multiple times a day on my server.
---
Raid/premade times. Guilds. Queue times. Latency. Trump spam.
---
Current wow has ruined current wow for me lol
---
It is because of layering, I was playing earlier in an empty orgrimmar but found it actually had over 100 players in the city in different layers by doing /who orgrimmar.
---
I joined an RFC group and it layered me into another slightly populated orgrimmar and then later a WC group that showed another different slightly populated layered org.
---
Its fucked, the city can have a pretty respectable 150 people in it but having them split between 5 or so layers making them all look dead.
---
Why is it so fucking hard to understand people want to talk to other people in their native language? It's not about not knowing basic english to communicate. It's about being comfortable and able to express your thoughts in great detail. I can't believe this concept is so foreign to so many people.
---
Oh no that's cringe, holy shit
---
Sleep
---
10/10, great take, big iq
---
&gt; According to Ian in an interview phase 2 is not going to have layering, at all, that was a statement and they tend to keep it.
---
With so few EU servers they will have a stack of layers per server, so what are they going to do when P2 comes and the server still uses 5 layers to hold active 15k pop? Dynamic respawns, splits, merges or queues? And why sacrifice one-world immersion with layering if you're going to end up with queues and merges anyway?
---
&gt; streamer extravaganza is blowing this up like nobodies business, its not supposed to blow up like this, people going on the wagon for no good reason at all
---
I disagree, there's too much attention to exploits but too little attention to immersion that layering breaks. Layering is a queue, but automated. Seamlessness is a lie, because the seams are very visible all the time. It's like home town turned into urban megalopolis, where high speed of transport is touted as seamless and efficient, but ends up just being a permanent nuisance as faceless drones go about their business. New places to group up are opened, but it's not the same thing, even if your group takes a second to smell the flowers, other people around them won't stop popping in and out.
---
&gt; Layering in short, puts you in a layer upon logging in, the system will try and keep you in that layer for aslong as it can, you will also remain in the same layer as your guildies and whatnot, according to the devs.
---
I don't want to log in to a layer with my guildies, I want a consistent world.
---
&gt; But people are intentionally inviting people that are on different layers to skip around ganks and stuff
---
This is not the main issue of layering. This is a supplementary issue that springs from the main issue.
---
&gt; Layering for the most part shouldn't matter to more then 80+% of people
---
It matters to everyone, regardless of their stance on layering. There is only one way to have a consistent world. Dungeons and raids were already a compromise, because they are sharded, and now it's amazing how the developers thought that it would be a good thing to further compromise the world integrity. I can accept dungeons, raids and battlegrounds, but these other shards/layers are too much since they break the main world.
---
&gt; If we can get a smoother launch and gameplay without queues and hickups and server crashes, then I'll take layering anyday
---
Why would you choose short term reward over the long term reward of no layering at all?
---
&gt; they're reacting like its the end of the world for whatever reason
---
Heh, but it literally is the end of "the world" if you know what I mean. Imho, layered worlds are no match to authentic home world feeling of a tight server community.
---
&gt; you'll be busy enough getting a few characters to 60 and geared up and getting epic mount, stop worrying about PvP stuff
---
We should consider the server and community at large, not just individual achievements. This lack of attention to community aspects - and by that I don't mean in-your-face group activities but subtle integrity of the game world - is perhaps what made current WoW so different from what Vanilla was.
---
I'm on Chrome, they do appear.
---
Hey. Do you have same thread on official forums? This looks pretty huge (especially because everyone agrees that leeway is overtuned right now) and worth at least response from devs.
---
Yes of course it's worth it. If it wasn't worth to play highly popular classes, then they wouldn't be highly popular.
---
Adapt, take over servers or simply not play.
---
It's a bit different coming from a country where even some kids shows are not dubbed and you learn English at an early age.
---
I've met so many people who understand English just so they get by in games, but it's not really enough if they don't feel comfortable with it.
---
Brother saw the light ! Welcome !
---
You seem to be under the impression that the EU realms are going to be English realms. They’re not, they’re going to be EU realms. You might as well ask “It’s 2019, don’t people speak Albanian?”
---
what's the problem with streamers? am i missing something?
---
Complains about people unable to speak english, proceeds to butcher english in his own post. GJ OP.
---
So for your warrior which seems he wants to tank in dungeons sounds like he likes to play like me. I would suggest [This](https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/?class=warrior&amp;talents=qfrqrrqcrsqlryrzrArBqmqisYqCsyszsAsBqGsKsLsMsNyPyQyRqFqEqzs-tatbtcqHH_H.s8s9qBsZs0s1s2In) build it is a DW build. But it is wonderful for being able to tank dungeons. If you scroll to the bottom you will see the build order. It gives him great utility in both PVP and PVE so he can still do really well in the open world as well as in dungeons. If the elites are not hitting as hard as they did on private servers like a lot of people are claiming i will be DW tanking the whole way up. If you are confident in your healing capabilities you'll be able to have him do the same. Best of luck if he has any questions don't hesitate to ask me.
---
The entire office meme was great
---
My boyfriend is rolling warrior on classic, he's got an entire group of friends that are rolling paladins, priests, etcetc, luckiest son of a bitch alive.
---
Meanwhile I got kicked down to druid for flag carrying duty. I am NOT impressed. Least I always have Horde side for my Windfury totem.
---
You get nothing
---
Or play Diablo III there almost the same in some way
---
They have added quite a few race/class pairs.
---
I mean, im not english, and my first language would be easier, but im not complaining about it.. Think people are just a bit to fuzzy about it. But im here to learn :P
---
Playing on a server with 20000 people on launch day does not either.
---
jejejeje
---
he is probably doing them himself... all the editing.
---
Thank fuck not alot of people think like this, waiting in queue for an hour would suck bad let alone 6
---
I find this post very ironic.
---
Layering has nothing to do with the endgame. Ion stated that it is only there 'for the first couple of weeks.'
---
I'm fairly certain those assets are aviable. like said, i just can't find them anymore
---
There was even Dklegolasdk, not lying
---
Everyone got it. It’s a stress test.
---
Swap the male and female orc cause Female orc warrior BAE!
---
I disagree completely.   Very happy they’re implementing cross realm for BG’s.  Especially as somebody that will be PvPing a lot and plays almost exclusively during off peak hours (morning and early afternoon EST).
---
Historicly not true, but i get your point!
---
Just because it *can* work doesn't mean it *should*.
---
you can't use yourself as an example and extrapolate that to the rest of the world.   
---
just because you're not complaining it doesn't mean every other person shouldn't either
---
the difference tho is that Swedes generally speak and write english and that germans are really bad at it.
---
“you guys know this isn’t a real mmorpg anymore, the game got ruined after Wotlk. guys stop having fun in BfA and listen !!”
---
PoE has been on my to do list but I can't shake the feeling that it's not tactical. Classic WoW had planning, crowd control, mob management... Does PoE?
---
The sense of completion and achieve will always be far greater un vanilla. We are comparing dota to league here, they are completely different games even though they are the same genre, differently paced and entirely for different type of players. Better or worst... that’s just an opinion at the end of the day. 
---
Sorry you didn’t like vanilla, the fun is in the journey to lvl 60 and it does get a lot better at lvl 60, I promise 💜
---
&gt; I mean, pritty much all of eastern europe, scandinavia and the baltics is better at english than the us/english people.... 
---
....................  
---
who told you this
---
I know why ;P
---
Also the rewards are capped per reset so even if you wanted to do more the game won't let you and if you fall behind you cannot catch up because the rewards for that particular day you missed are gone forever.
---
Yeah. 3 classes. Races are almost entirely cosmetic, which they have generally done well with.
---
Glad to hear that I'm not the only one feeling this way.
---
It's really a pain in the ass. Forgot to mention (it's not that I want to start a shitstorm about Elderscrolls online) but the way their dungeon finder is set up is exactly like retail WoW.
---
You are invited in a random group of 4 Players, get shit out in some random dungeon, people most of the times neither say hello nor goodbye and there is absolutely no need to text at all even in the veterans dungeon (comparable to mythic+ dungeons)
---
In the open world there is ABSOLUTELY no interaction with other players, besides you play with irl friends.
---
And another thing I am really really worried about is that servers are not divided in specific languages (as it is planned for classic atm). Eso has one big European megaserver where every country and language, even Cyrillic is mixed together. It is absolutely horrible trying to communicate with people and I can for sure tell you there WILL be by far less interaction with people who barely can or are not willing to understand you. 
---
I am not unwilling to adapt to a certain language in this case English as it is the most common language (tho my mother tongue is German) 
---
But there is no way a community is forming on servers where 50% are willing to speak English, the rest speaks Spanish, Turkish, France, Russian and what not, you get the idea.. 
---
This isn't made up by me, you could watch every day how miserly communicating is on this non language divided servers if you would log into Eso one day and spend a few hours in a capital city.
---
Noobs. I lvled to lvl 19 in 14 hours as a warrior before i died my first time. No help from my main.
---
You clearly don’t know how to be a dominant man in a relationship.
---
Then again, I am in the wow sub
---
Dunno what lh k1 k2 k3, or morthdale is. Guess servers. I didn't say it had happened, nor would I know as I've never played on one. I'm just saying I don't trust private servers over Blizzard's own servers. I feel it's time wasted when it's not on the real actual servers, even if they stay up forever. Was the same in my old Ultima Online days, even there I only played on the real live servers, even though private ones = free, as no monthly subscription was needed.
---
Sorry for not wanting to play on private servers. There's no need to downvote me for that.
---
Agree, thats why i try to use the word "think" alot :P
---
But if he wants to play rogue, but dont want to play the most populated class, and rogue becomes that.. Then playing what he likes doesnt necessarily mean he will have fun
---
Highly developed, jokes on you.  Italy has been stagnant since the 90's  and their children lives with their parents for a long time... " At the opposite end of the scale, young adults in Malta and Croatia  remained the longest in the parental household. **They left home at an  average age** of 32.2 and 31.9 respectively. Young adults in Slovakia  (30.8 years), **Italy (30.1 years)**, Greece (29.4 years), Spain (29.3  years), Portugal (29.2 years) and Bulgaria (28.9 years) also left the  parental home at a later stage. **"**  
---
Also France have a lot of tourists, so if they can't communicate with foreigners they will just seem arrogant and uneducated.  It's sad they don't learn English how are they supposed to acquire or share any knowledge? They eventually fall behind because of their stubbornness.   
---
I've been all of these countries, I know Germans are more educated and most of them can speak English. So I don't really have any issues with them.
---
Wait until you realize how important professions are that now are obsolete..like enchanting. Wait until you’re forced to be patient with someone who isn’t necessarily great at playing their class and get to watch them develop. Wait until you get ONE mount and have it be the greatest thing that could ever happen. Wait until you experience Barrens/trade chat..haha. Wait until you don’t have to worry about quantifying someone’s skill by their gearscore/item level. Wait until you have to write macros to be proficient at your class. Wait until you make long term friends in the game because you see them every time you play. 
---
The list goes on. There is a reason this was when WoW subscriptions rose at unprecedented levels and made it the legendary game it was. It’s hard for me to remember sometimes that many if not most players haven’t experienced anything but relatively current content. And while everyone is entitled to their own opinions, those who are forming that opinion without experiencing what everyone is saying are in for a wonderful surprise. 
---
Hope to meet you in game, but if not, enjoy Azeroth!!
---
Aren’t they a little young to assume their faction? Let em make their own choice ;P
---
You will also want to tab sunder and cleave otherwise you will lose threat just spam shouting.
---
Why the French have to be the ugliest ones... 🤔 Well I guess they have the best racials then
---
Guess that's why Ironman challenges are so popular...
---
There was a discussion in another thread around this, the most common comment that struck me was: "in vanilla I played in server X and after a while it was overrun with Y speaking people".
---
I am against this, for few simple reasons.
---
15 years ago the server cap was much lower, we're speaking of ~1500/2000 players on both sides, so language-speaking communities were pretty much encouraged.
---
I say now it's more safe to take private servers in the past 4 years as a base reference; they introduced larger server size accomodating over 7000 players at any given time with spikes of 15k, if before 1200 players out of 1500 were from a single country, being 80% of the server population in a 15k server it would be less than the 10% of the player base.
---
Even if it's an unpopular opinion I would be open to expand the servers as many timezones as possible. Playing along with NA, EU and Asian players on the same server pretty much allows to have dungeons running all the day long and have a more "casual" approach on the game and less waiting times on LFG spam on trade chat.
---
In a regional server however my biggest fear is that we will go back on the same issues we all had back in the days, dungeon/raid time are confined only on the evening hours as well as long wait times for anything else during the rest of the day.
---
In my opinion that is why the current model of the most popular private servers do actually work, don't forget that most of the vanilla players now are well in their 30s and above, most of us have family, partners and work commitments which can sometimes see us busy in the morning and sometimes busy in the evenings. People's spare time span around the clock and not only "9pm server time".
---
I have leveled a character to 60 myself on a private server in a completely uninterested matter over the course of 5/6 months, I never felt the sense of "overcrowding" nor faction imbalance or a dominant foreign language.
---
Korean and Chinese players of course stand out from the crowd on trade yells and chat but I delightfully quested and ran dungeons with them, most of the Asian players spoke English and those who didn't copied and pasted from an obvious Google translate, funny to read but greatly appreciated.
---
It's 2019, world is more globalized than ever and we should start to think forward instead of isolating ourselves to our 4 virtual walls.
---
&gt; First thing I notice is the mobs hit like a truck. If you pull more than one, you're probably dead. 
---
*Laughs in Warlock while juggling 3-4 mobs with ease*
---
Its easy to make changes in any codebase thats not trash.
---
Unfortunately most developers have little experience, henxe most codebases are trash.
---
:(
---
This is a joke, right?
---
One of the OG devs that came from everquest once explained it simply as the conundrum of what to do when the player gains power. 
---
 The player gaining power is the classic experience, everything afterwards the player already has power so its not the same.
---
As someone who cut his teeth tanking tbc heroics, man I loved those heroic cata dungeons before they got nerfed.   No dungeon in wrath really felt challenging at all.
---
More like the sound of someone who wants to discuss anything else than "the only allowed way to play WoW". Also someone who wants to stay in topic.
---
But sure, anything else than what the min-maxers think is children crying.
---
&gt;that for the first 3 weeks or so
---
What if it's all the way until phase 2? What if it's months?
---
I want to upvote your comment more than once. But I can't.
---
We can dream!
---
Get downvoted
---
If a server holds 5 layers of active players when Phase 2 comes out, does it mean they will have to split / merge / dynamic respawn / queue anyway?
---
Because if they have the capability and intention to still config servers with only one layer in phase 2, then it means that they are certain those populations will all fit one server?
---
trump2020
---
not quite true but i like the approach. trispec is still the best for leveling with a warrior. wand -&gt; spirit tap -&gt; holy nova -&gt; inner focus -&gt; silence.
---
You exaggerate a lot of things and make wrong conclusions. Just because you choose not to cc monsters it doesn’t mean that you can’t/shouldn’t/others aren’t doing it in dungeons. Just because you choose not to socialize in retail it doesn’t mean others don’t. Just because you can’t pull 2 monsters without dying it doesn’t mean others can’t, it’s just that some classes lack the tools necessary. Getting gear in vanilla was just as easy as it is today and almost everyone could clear mc/zg and be full epic in a matter of resets or even farm gold and buy entire sets in the auction house without ever killing a boss.
---
I played vanilla ever since it became available in my country and I loved it, but let’s be real and stop comparing a 2004 game that took 10+ years of development to BfA which took 1 year to make. Also let’s not pretend that it’s Blizzard’s fault that people abuse the game systems in order to breeze through content, without socializing or committing to parties. They put a fantastic voice chat system in game and no one uses it because they don’t care! When they put voice chat in vanilla we were amazed and excited so much that we broke it. 
---
Game changed over the years but so have the people. I blame the people for the problems and not the talented developers who try to please us.
---
We should have stopped at death knights
---
You can, me and plenty of others do.
---
The difference being a difficult and challenging leveling experience versus a more fun-focused &amp; simple leveling experience, most likely with new players in mind, with retail mythic being the far more difficult endgame content, versus Classics overtuned(in some cases) bosses, and artificial difficulty-pieces.
---
The benefits, are that the more challenging content (leveling in Classic/Raiding Mythic) both bring a sense of community that you don't get during the retail leveling progression, and some don't get during the Vanilla raiding, as you can pass through it with 5 friends that know ehat they're doing and 35 people that know what buttons to press, unlike Retail where every person has to know every inch of the fight and so on.
---
You can easily love and hate both simultaneously without it being a problem. One more streamlined, but also more layered, one far more open to exploration and testing things, but also a lot more basic in terms of mechanics.
---
they do...
---
You’re clearly very hurt by these people existing and I hope you can recover so you can enjoy your 15 year old game exactly the way you remember it.
---
The echoes of children crying is found within this comment.
---
The heroics in Cata weren't difficult though.
---
I wonder if the delay on pet commands has to do with spell batching. If so that may not get fixed.
---
Current WoW ruined current WoW for me but go off king
---
All i am saying is Orc Female Warrior is the best model in the game with plate.
---
I loved how strong you felt when you grouped up. I rolled a mage yesterday and man you have to be careful if you’re alone and you can pull slowly and carefully alone but even if you find one partner to quest with you feel so much stronger together, like the boys out in Azeroth. 
---
I went and rolled the same exactly thing in retail and I literally pulled 7 mobs and didn’t die at level 2 or 3. I’m thinking to myself “Why the hell am I so strong?” I didn’t even do anything but pay for the game and I’m already an unkillable machine...so sad what the modern game is. It’s like a gross perversion of the classic game, especially when you play it back to back.
---
What do you mean, we got the best race. Gnome have glorious moustache
---
Won't be playing it at all, made a joke. So sorry I hurt your feelings.
---
But layering is not zone-specific.
---
Love it when US server people complain about the brazilian servers and basicly blacklist them in retail wow and yet go full retard here.
---
This is an issue with 1 language. We have English, German, French, Spanish, Italian as well as many unofficial language servers like turkish nether (twisting nether), czech realms, swedish, danish, netherlands.
---
Fucking retards
---
ur logic is false, its like saying that old talent trees were removed because "everyone realized how shitty they actually is."
---
If developers wanted to remove World PVP they would do it more than 10 years ago back in WOTLK or TBC.
---
world pvp rewards is questing items and xp, world pvp makes questing more fun and challenging because u need to defend ur self, this can be avoided by going to pve realm or unbalanced realm with only one faction, but the same way other things in WOW can be avoided like getting boosted or carried by geared friends in Raid and dungeon while being under geared on alt
---
There are no unnecessary QOL improvements. QOL improvement is what drives people to live. It’s the reason we wake up every morning to go to work.
---
Imagine private servers being able to handle more players and massive ddos attack’s than blizzard in 2019.
---
and not even one "kurwa"? :/
---
I don't recognize some of those
---
No it's an action rpg. Build for optimal kill speed vs survivability. Best skill tree path, minmax on items and whole trade game too
---
yeah no. spirit of redemption is not really a thing you would do in a normal spec.
---
Complaining*
---
Oh no thank you.
---
I don't know how this wasn't the most obvious thing, and the most obvious point this meme could have.
---
Snorted.
---
Quite funny. 
---
We, french people make fun of Belgian. Half of them actually speak french too...
---
its actually quite easy to tell the difference between 2.5 and 3 sec heal.
---
Thanks, thats just a leftover from when I introduced localiztation! Going to be fixed in the next version :)
---
I played in the recent stress test.  Made a troll rogue, similar to my troll rogue in vanilla.  When I logged in, the starting area was full of players.  Teamed up with a shaman, we quested together for 2 hours straight.  Died a bunch of times.  Had a blast.
---
Then I returned to retail, logged into the Barrens, did a /who.
---
0 players.
---
Yeah that's what I figured... I don't care about numbers as much as I care about puzzle solving, so to speak. 
---
Like if I was an action movie hero, I'd be John Wick weaving in and out of cover, using people as shields. PoE is like Rambo. Jumping out if trees with with two machine guns and blowing up tanks and sentry outposts.
---
That damn rogue stealth
---
I think OP has tricked us. It's actually retail at peak times atm
---
You're pretty fucking dumb, aren't you? Here, let me "enlighten" you.
---
Day one at launch, 50k people make an orc or troll within the first 20 minutes on one server and thus 50k people are fighting for the same mobs, the same items, and the same *everything* for the first several days. 
---
Or, day one, 50k people make an orc or a troll on one server but get layered into a continent of 3k people spread across all races and factions. Now that 50k number is only say 1k people. They spread out faster and stop fighting for the same stuff within a matter of hours not days or weeks. 
---
Mindblowing right? Oh no that's right, it's pretty fucking basic.
---
I believe blizzard said they wanted to implement it for the crowdiness at launch, after a week or so i think the playerbase will be very diverse in levels, eliminating their perceived need for layering. I cant imagine it lasting a whole month
---
You haven’t played wow. Vanilla was the easiest version of wow.
---
well you should "think" that you are wrong whenever you use yourself as an example and try to say other's are acting too fuzzy about it because you feel indifferent
---
Judging by [Requires Tiger Riding](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13086/reins-of-the-winterspring-frostsaber), apparently you indeed need Darn exalted. 
---
But it's first time I'm hearing it. Live and learn I guess.
---
But it shouldn't matter much, Wintersaber Trainers exalted is like 10 times more grind than Darn exalted.
---
As a streamer of a very small community i am really hoping people don't hate on everyone. I want to stream this game because i love wow and I want to help people better understand it. i have played on every single classic server and tanked through KT so when i am Main tanking in classic i want people to be able to come into my chat and watch my awesome guild and ask us how we do things. I want to be able to be a small niche streamer for those who want to  have fun and maybe learn something about being part of a non toxic community and hopefully spread that manta to others here.
---
Yeah those Albaniens sure have had a big pressence on the world stage and spread their culture all over the world, inovating navigation, cartography and other milestones in human history. /s
---
Because their client is already translated in their native language and have been for the past 15 years. It seems natural for them to have their dedicated servers
---
Same here, keeping a secret until then
---
I was wondering the same thing, if it was just nostalgia fueling peoples desire for classic.  I leveled up a Warrior in current WoW to level 85 or 90, and was bored to tears with it. I didn't get into the beta, so I looked into private servers. Hoped on one, and now that's all I play. I can hardly stomach logging into current WoW. I'm currently a level 32 rogue, with about 65 hours played, with sooooo much to do.
---
I'm rolling EU Rp, I'd much prefer RPVP but we will have to see if they actually give us a server
---
Is that seriously a thing? What the heck man
---
This whole thing is a wild hot take. Compared to Mages, who really don't have much responsibility in a raid other than coordinating ignites, Warlocks have a much higher stress job with no aggro mitigation, the strongest sustained aoe in the game, and no oh shit button. 
---
Warlocks have a boatload more utility and far more responsibility.
---
The only thing they said for sure is that it won't be there on phase 2. Everything else is wishful thinking (I mean I *hope* it'll be gone in couple of weeks too).
---
MW was solid af in Legion, what are you talking about? They were hard to play, and mana-hungry as hell, but could easily stay just behind the OP druid if played right.
---
Then they got buffed, and passed even druids.
---
what if the world ends tomorrow
---
ur not making an argument
---
Why should they cater to Germans and French, removing them from the European community?
---
My dream for years now has been progressive servers where they go through the expansion, one a year, so I can relive the entire story from start to finish!
---
Spec shadow, melt his face and call him your « Training dummy ».
---
Don't have to worry about language barriers on RP relms if there aren't any RP relms.
---
Yeah haha!
---
99 little bugs in the code, 99 little bugs in the code, take one down, patch it around, 127 little bugs in the code!
---
To be honest, if Blizz simply cap layering on, say, 3 weeks, 90% of the shitstorm will be over. I think that most worries come exactly from "what if layering lasts for long" idea.
---
Thank you for the thorough reply! Yeah it's really a toss up - I really enjoy the flavor of rogues (poisons, lockpicking, pickpocketing etc.) and melee DPS but healing has always been quite relaxing and I would really enjoy not sitting around spamming people to group up indeed. 2 more months to decide I guess!
---
Cuz murica. Bald eagles, guns and Donald Trump. Fuck yeah.
---
I don’t know what games you play but wow isn’t like this.
---
Le literally this!!!!! To the top with you!!!!
---
EDIT: DOWNVOTES?!? REALLY?!?
---
From 13th to 27th, maaaaaaaybe.
---
but that's already the plan. blizzard have been pretty transparent on layering as far as the length of it goes
---
I don't get it, you're allowed to speak German, French, Swedish, polish and every other language in the world with your friends but in official channels we speak English.
---
I mained priest in vanilla. Will play it again in classic. Rank healing is just too much fun &lt;3
---
Vanilla WoW also had a server cap of 2500 which we know will be absolutely dwarfed now in classic. Dynamic spawns only go so far, which puts us back to do they dramatically cut the server populations and eventually do mergers as the influx of players die down, or layer it for a while.
---
I would rather not get in day 1 than have the first few months ruined with layering 100%.
---
Being solid is not good enough. They brought 0 raid utility. Revival is weak, still is really, cocoon is okay I guess now, in Legion it was pretty bad.
---
Fair point.
---
The biggest advantage of hitting 60 early is that you now get to group with other people who are as invested as you and do the end-game dungeons with them. This will make doing that stuff much more enjoyable, and will allow you to build connections making it easier to get into more engaged guilds if that's what you're into.
---
Any statistical advantage like being able to farm gear or mats or whatever is gonna be mostly irrelevant after a month or two.
---
MW Monk was also pretty decent in WOD arena
---
&gt; I know that in some areas english just isn't spoken by a lot of people
---
Give Albanian servers or I unsub.
---
It's just a joke, I support German and French and Spanish servers.
---
You apparently read my post out of context.
---
The problem isn't the 50% that talk English and join a mixed EU guild. The problem is the rest of the 50% that don't want to speak English and purposefully piss off other people by doing this.
---
Just to farm gold to buy game time for classic
---
Yes. Compared the WotLK they were very difficult.
---
Original legend of Zelda on the NES comes to mind
---
Any feature that allows instagrouping and instaporting, is inherently OPPOSITE to the very fundamentals of MMORPGs.
---
LFR is not only inherently bad, it is 100% the OPPOSITE of what MMORPG means.
---
Ignorance is bliss I can agree on that. But I do not agree with you going around spreading your blatantly awful spec.
---
Honestly I really enjoyed monk healing, and also monk tanking is very unique. WW is a bit meh tho tbh. MW really fills a good niche imo and there were some encounters where I could easily outheal better geared players of other classes just due to its healing style
---
Yeah sorry, I was referring to players online concurrently on Classic Beta PvP realm and that number peaked at 435 total since thursday.
---
So? Did I attack him? I couldn't know and I'm used to misunderstandings on reddit so I'm not sure what issue you take with me clarifying in friendly manner.
---
Sure it will. You won't have to queue for 12 hours to be able to play.
---
What a good way to explain how fucking boring casual experience modern WoW has become, Blizzard made all these changes to fit the majority of gamers, but ended up killing WoW as people remembered it and why they started in the first place. All modern WoW is today, is a dungeon crawler and not MMORPG anymore.
---
10-15K pop?
---
I mean it's no wonder that these people are so bad at English when their countries are doing everything to make sure they don't have to use it. Every form of media is overdubbed, all text is translated, even games are dubbed and translated. No wonder you suck at English...
---
EU realms is an opportunity for these people to finally come out of the closet and learn the language. If it works fine on private servers it'll work fine on Classic too.
---
Why? Mandarin isn't known as a global language. Everyone knows they have more native speakers but everyone also knows that all first world countries have English in their curriculum THEREFORE it's a universal language. Use the universal language in a massive multiplayer online game.
---
Just watched that segment, laughed at the end regarding focusing on analytics to guide game design:
---
"You don't sound like a person, Ion... you sound like a computer trying to evolve into a sentient AI."
---
If you start a PvP guild with a focus on streamer hunting you will get more issues than bonuses. Lots of your "guildies" will be there JUST for the hunts. Streamers are often instanced and can't be hunted. For the first few weeks you will have to fight layering. What happens when people grow tired of it?
---
Sure it would be fun every once in a while to arrange some wPvP, but I think streamer hunting will be a niche thats almost exclusively fun to WATCH when people like the Ooga gang does it.
---
It seems like queue + dynamic respawn + free server transfers is what they’ll do with high pop servers.
---
&gt;Yet currently skeletons seem to be despawning in under 20 minutes and only one skeleton per player is allowed to be up at any given time.
---
&gt;My guess is that they will not change this unless someone forces their hand.
---
I can't really see anyone caring enough about skeleton timers, or 1 skeleton per player enough to force any hands...
---
Seems to benefit the region though as a whole.
---
I feel this 100% bro. I play every expansion to max level and soak up the lore( missed MOP though ) , but nothing much after that.  I tried to do some random quests on retail after classic and I logged after running through what had to be 100 trolls and dinosaurs without dying to look for some stupid outpost.  The state of the game was obvious after all the fun I had getting a night elf to level 8 on the stress.
---
I've played in a starting zone on a realm where the pop jumped up 5k overnight. It wasn't even bad to the point of being particularly frustrating, let alone unplayable. The only people who suffer in those situations are completionists who can't handle not doing a quest.
---
Mm ... where , in the game, is the place in the Drawing? ... seems like stormwind / Lordaeron related...
---
Thanks for the submission, I really appreciate it. Every tiny piece helps to complete the greater puzzle :)
---
Don't be daft. No Dutch natives prefer German over English.
---
Sure. I will do that on the English servers. I won't cry and say "Swedes are amongst the most progressive gamers of all time. We want to play with our own kind. Don't force us to play with non-swedes".
---
How many more of these do we need to post to see that this is a huge issue.
---
Also "told you so" to 50% of this subreddit when blizzard first announced the layering system.
---
Make fun of "no changes" all you want but this is what you get
---
lol no
---
Layering will go away when it goes away. Could be weeks, could be months. Maybe never? Who knows? Blizzard isn't committing a drop time for it.
---
&gt; Assuming that blizzard could put a 0.5s delay on the game and there was literally no way for people to get around it, no I don't think they should. Forcing the artificial lag like that, while an accurate experience to what some people had during vanilla is, unreasonable because it would kill the game for most people.
---
I was told that the best mana efficiency you can get from priest is Improved Power Word: Shield, and that means respecting to Shadow only after 50 so you can have PW:S and Shadow Form.
---
Sounds like a good compromise tbh, though my real concern is them not removing layering entirely asap.
---
I'm digging your point of view. Can totally get behind that
---
Raiding is fun in retail, but when we're done with Azshara and her raid. Our guild will probably enjoy Classic until 8.3
---
this dish has more ingredients, its of superior taste!
---
Classic wow was always superior that's why we bitched at blizzard to bring it back son
---
[Good luck with that...](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_sanders-6250.html)
---
Clearly you haven't been interacting with people on retail (not that you'd have a reason to).
---
Yup. Np getting exalted with Darnassus. I will create my Human priest and travel to Darnassus/Teldrassil/etc and quest there. Will die a few times on my way there, I guess, but np.
---
Absolute waste of time to everybody planning to read this reply.
---
Nope. Every country has English in their curriculum. It's not a privilege.
---
I wouldn't be too worried, There will be a lot of more casual guilds this time around. All of the info for raids and equipment is readily available so it will make the experience smoother. Plus with a lot more 30+ age players like myself it will be fun just for the social aspect.
---
Back then people unironically named themselves this because they wanted to be their hero (Legolas)
---
Nowadays there'll be tons of people ironically naming themselves that in an attempt to be funny.
---
It'll never stop
---
I think that comparison makes sense wrt the action side. But since POE has more rpg elements and lots of other things to optimise you could still do that tactical approach but in the build and plann of your character. I personally don't think retail or classic wow has that same type of feeling.
---
Both are great and POE is free so as along as you have time give it a go. The devs are also very communicative with the community which is refreshing too.
---
Mm? The only definite thing they said is that it won't be there on Phase 2.
---
If I were you and hellbent on getting that mount then I'd be going to Teldrassil by L5 and doing literally every NE quest. Good luck.
---
you know what they say...
---
:o how do I get one
---
Referencing on Reddit comments...?
---
I don't think the node is on a 1 minute spawn time, is it?
---
thank you
---
Couldn't agree less.
---
Sharding is. Which is why, again, I want layering to be only active in specific zones, but consistent, throughout said zones.
---
Prioritize the improved totems in the Enh tree. So the first Will be Str/agi totem. Then alot further down improved WF totem.  
---
Once you have that, id go into resto instantly and get mana efficient talents for heals and totems and totem range
---
Youll be support damaging with your own 2h wep with WF ofc. But the focus is keeping the warrior at a place where he NEVER stops pulling.  So you’ll move along and keep him WF buffed and throw a heal now and then to prevent sitting to eat etc.  But dont blow your mana on shocks and shit. Your mana is for Totems and Healing to keep the down time to 0. 
---
When your warrior gets sweeping strikes at 30 he Will start doing insane damage, couple sweeping with cleave and its GG om chain pulls of 2by2. 
---
At 34 you get WF totem and it gets even crazier. Mobs Will start dying so damn fast.  And at 36 the warrior gets Whirlwine and you can start taking 3-4 at a time - so long as you have Sweeping Strikes ready.  
---
It may sound boring for the shaman, but if you are Rolling shaman you should be the type that enjoys support. And its super fun to be able to ”allow” a warrior to go nuts - specially when you are two friends on voice coms. 
---
Sorry if the format is shit - im on mobile.
---
Can't wait playing my Demon Hunter in Classi!
---
&gt;What if it's all the way until phase 2? What if it's months?
---
what if there is no layering at all? and you are staring at a 3 hour queue everytime you want to log in for the 1st 45 days. Have you ever set an alarm for 4am. just to get into a log in queue, go back to bed and then wake up at 10am with 30 minutes still still on the queue? if you have, and still don't think layering is a necessary evil. Then I don't know what to say to you.
---
Well it won't bring you to exalted most likely (I've seen guides, but people said that it's private server thingy with increased rep gains). You'll still need Morrowgrain or cloth. But overall it's np compared to WS Trainers indeed.
---
And Priest
---
I fired up retail last night just to see how it looks.  It looks like garbage.
---
OHHHH this explains a lot lmao
---
It can have a bad effect in PvP. If consumables are really cheap it will make people more prone to use them in World PvP scenarios, which can have a negative effect on the experience.
---
Powerful consumables should cost imo.
---
I think they should just make it so you can't change layers during PvP or within 5 minutes of PvP and maybe even PvE or any combat at all.
---
Put a cooldown on layer hopping intentionally, something like 60 minutes.
---
The druid thing is a different issue. Druids on classic beta have anywhere from 5-20 less damage value for shapeshifted attacks than they do on private servers. No doubt, the classic beta versions are the correct values, but it does make druids worse for leveling and they lose some threat/dps for end game content.
---
"You - Me, FuckFuck?"
---
This. There’s so much opportunity for expansion just in the things that never got fully developed in classic. Kara crypts, Hyjal, and so on. But the entire outlook and philosophy of the development team has changed. Just look at their inability to fix retail. Literally everyone knows what the problems are, and they could just do a massive (much more than 8.2) overhaul like cataclysm to fix it, but they just don’t get it on a fundamental level. 
---
I don’t think people realize how much content is in classic and the time it will take to even experience endgame content. People are so used to clearing endgame in a month that they don’t fully comprehend that it will probably be a couple years before the conversation of expanded content even needs to happen.
---
Hoe about no layering out of starting zones? 
---
Aannd its fixed.
---
“some people were mean to me so now i hate them all for having fun in a different game &gt;:( “
---
again you could change around classic and retail in this copypasta of a comment you just posted 
---
For years my elitists friend shat on current WoW and me for having fun in MoP Legion, that doesn’t mean i’m not glad the classic community got their win and il
---
not excited to play classic, maybe i’ll get bored, maybe i won’t. The point is, there is assholes in every community, single them out is the worst thing to do
---
It's hard to keep a codebase from evolving into trash over time.
---
I do mostly agree that layering is a necessary evil. But I'm concerned about it possibly lasting months.
---
Go play Justice Online. It's 2019, don't people speak Chinese?
---
Path of least resistance or whatever, go play Justice Online and learn Chinese. Chances are, you'll simply quit. Same goes for 60% of Europe's playerbase, which **doesn't** play on English realms.
---
This is where you (and many others, including Blizzard) are DEAD WRONG.
---
Classic will steal a good chunk of BfA player base...because retail WoW, while built for modern gamers, still have roughly 30-40% of the players that are TRUE MMORPG players, but they don't have anything else to play.
---
Those 30-40% will change to Classic as their main game very, very quickly.
---
I seriously doubt that BfA will survive Classic, in terms of active players.
---
It is going to be a ghost town, come August 27th, and it will snowball from there.
---
they better not, layering is to prevent those things
---
+morrowgrain turn ins for darnassus( everyone wants a tiger anyway) or thunderbluff
---
There isn't a need. We know how to speak English and since we don't segregate ourselves. We found our countrymen around the world of Warcraft. And we befriend each other if we like each other.
---
How the fuck is there an orc in Mulgore?
---
To be honest I don‘t understand the fuss being made about EU-servers. German player here. It‘s not like you arent’t allowed to speak german or form a guild with other german players.
---
Now think on the flipside- if they released no content after WoTLK, would your even still be here? What would people be doing? All “good” MMOs are doomed to the same fate.
---
&gt;One of my favorite bits is him talking about "The Egg Timer" from Ultima Online and how that translates into modern WoW: https://youtu.be/JwojRc4ZAOM?t=1849
---
Oh boy. He's spot on there and this is such a great bit - just the first 10 or so seconds from your time marker. I see why you like it. It's a huge problem of modern wow and pop culture in general.
---
It's also to fix the queues. If you've ever witnessed a private server launch you'll see what I mean by queues.. these are not some dinky 500-1000 queues that last a few minutes. I'm talking epic 50k queues that last the whole day. 
---
But yes it will be chaotic and I think Blizzard said they want it to be chaotic because that's what it was like during launch. It is epic to see a sea of players trying to tag mobs. I especially like seeing the tauren starting place, it's just something funny about a herd of cow-people waddling about.
---
Thats the reason he's complaining. His tank was unholy xD
---
Please don't use the r word.
---
3k players online at the same time is authentic. Don't change that
---
&gt; “some people were mean to me so now i hate them all for having fun in a different game &gt;:( “
---
You lack reading comprehension. I explicitly don't hate them for having fun in their game, I hate them for being utter dicks towards people who don't have fun in their game.
---
Go back to school, pick up some books and learn to read.
---
terrible launches were never uncommon with wow, starting with vanilla
---
my point is, even the better expansions followed the trend post wrath
---
This is great
---
Absolutely not.
---
I clicked on a retail streamer by mistake and felt sick from watching for just 2 minutes.
---
&gt; They've said it could last through phase 2.
---
This is a total falsehood.
---
Are you drunk ? There were dozens of german realms to release...
---
Absolutely... If there was LFR for those raids, the encounters would've lossed so much meaning and mystery. One of the coolest things about them was they were hard to get to, and it was something to strive toward with your guild.
---
Last night, husband went to play some Destiny and ran back into the living room going "Classic WoW is out! Classic WoW is out!" He was pretty tipsy and it took a bit to explain it was just the stress test. "Don't care, wanna play!" So I grabbed a token off the AH and bought him some game time and we had fun playing dwarves all night. We're currently playing 2 gnome monks on retail because now he's got the WoW bug and is antsy for Classic release.
---
 I'm so jazzed - our game interests rarely overlap that well, and while we will each play a game the other likes so we can play together, we've yet to find one we both adore (outside of MUDs, where we met, and don't play anymore, too much time investment). WoW lets us each do what we like but still play together, so he'll go off min-maxing and I'll pick flowers and it's all benefiting both of us. We are very pumped for Classic release, but also having a great Saturday being derpy newbs on retail because the stress test got us playing together again.
---
My friends and I are making a Dutch (mainly Flemish) guild, there's never been any Dutch servers and we'll only speak Dutch on discord/guild chat and English everywhere else. Don't really see the problem why French and Germans can't do the same but mehhh, if they want their own server fine

It's not good for the buisness if the country fails to populate the server/s and then are (eventually) forced to be merged to a English server, resorting in a high influx of Germans or French people protest-speaking their won language and refusing to cooperate with English speakers

What's your idea to solve conflicting guild character names? You better have one, otherwise your idea is worse than layering.
---
Thats not even a picture.
---
The same hunger for classic wow, just like the other men bobby b
---
YOU EVER FUCK A RIVERLANDS GIRL?
---
Sounds like you have a pretty pessimistic outlook on this, eh? I understand though given BFA. I just think layering is the easiest thing to sort of undo post launch. Making smaller servers creates its own problems as well. People aren’t going to agree on this but I would rather populated servers that feel alive throughout the phases of classic
---
It’s just something new that people are excited for. (New for people didn’t play vanilla or TBC). How retail wow got to where it is now? The people who played vanilla and such, who voiced their opinions, its almost a natural progress.

This is nonsense.  If there were that many people fighting over the same few spawns in tyr's hand the vast majority of them would leave to farm somewhere else, as it wouldn't be the least bit profitable.
---
Seems to not be his main action bar, as it's action bar 4. Each is probably a different spell. I get why you'd maybe want 3 different healing touches, but what's the point in 3 different ranked rejuvs?
---
I believe that the player-centric way to do this is similar to layering, but with static realm populations and aggressive merges when needed. 
---
**Clusters** (21,000 active players) consist of various (3,000 active) Segments which all share a name pool for easy future merges. Dragontooth 1, Dragontooth 2, Dragontooth 3, Dragontooth 4, Dragontooth 5, Dragontooth 6, Dragontooth 7 comprise the Dragontooth Cluster.
---
You pick a segment to sign up on, just as though it were a server. It effectively is a server because the population never changes day to day on your cluster. Nobody comes in, nobody leaves, unless they started a new toon or quit.
---
Any two Segments with population drops can be merged together. Until then and after then, players on each segment log in every day to the same player base. Strangers become acquaintances become friends as they did in Vanilla and TBC. The downside will be the painful merge (or a few merges) to compensate for the expected population decline BUT, if population does not decline, Clusters have an advantage over layering in that they allow for Segments to stand on their own, never needing a merge.
---
Layering a megaserver is similar to sharding when the person you quested with yesterday is logged into a different layer today. Mobs, nodes, and people disappear upon group invite. People exploit it and you wonder if you should learn the exploit or just accept that the economy is getting more scuffed every minute. We've seen how exploitable it is in myriad videos. If the expected population decline doesn't happen on some servers then Layering will be around forever or they'll have to find a way of separating the population. Layering is rife with downsides and has only one advantage over Clusters: avoiding merges.
---
They are not. Their accents are bad but they are not bad at english by any means.

That's not even remotely similar lmao. Name one first world country that has mandarin in their school curriculum. I'll wait... Btw, I won't name the ones with English as a required language in the curriculum because that's ALL OF THEM. THEY ALL DO. because it's THE UNIVERSAL language. China has over a billion inhabitants and people who have migrated to all over the world. Doesn't Change the fact that ALL 1ST WORLD COUNTRIES LEARN ENGLISH AND NONE REQUIRE YOU TO LEARN MANDARIN :)

True, still highly developed

I fully agree that layering has alot of positives and it's a good thing at launch. But, my problem is that it can ve abused by layer jumping. But that problem seems to have a very easy fix: Have a cooldown between layer jumping. So when u jump from layer 1 to layer 2, you have a 12 or 24hr cooldown where u can't switch layers. I don't know how easy that cooldown is for Blizzard to actually implement to the game, but it sounds easy enough? Like my issue is that someone might for example rush to gurubashi arena at launch (just run there at lvl 1) and be the only one there, and if he's on a popular server with say 10 layers, he can realm jump and get 10 chests, netting him massive amounts of gold by selling those lvl 40+ greens + potions + getting 10x Arena Master Trinkets.

Thats why gnomes are so good , if you dont move in battleground people will sometimes confuse you with a totem
---
I wish there was an option to get to a server with a queue and dynamic respawns right from the beginning... But then everyone would get in those and no one would join the "smoother experience" that layering supposedly provides.
---
I would pay double or triple monthly to get a consistent world. 😐
---
What you mean
---
Heals and Hammer of Wrath ( paladin ranged execute ) both reset swing timer. ):
---
Early dungeons like RFC are a bit special too since classes are so low level they don't even have all their abilities yet.
---
It's like a restaurant coming up with the recipe for THE best burger ever.
---
And then they realise they can take away the onion and save some money.
---
And then the owner's new wife doesn't like salad so they take that out too.
---
And then the meat patty goes to appease the vegan crowds that have started coming in.
---
And one day they come in to work and find out that nobody likes their fucking two bare pieces of bread burger, and they're just absolutely gobsmacked.

Dwarf priest, orc warrior, human mage

Sure I can, WoW isn't immune to toxicity. Just look at the battleground chat and you'll see rage, wiping in pugs you'll see rage.
---
It's two thirds of the way through summer, which is pretty fucking close to the middle of summer.
---
Just because you went back to school doesn't make actual summer over.
---
I feel like they truly do understand what's wrong with the game, but at this point know it's impossible to really fix retail's core issues in a smooth way. With the ingame item shop and all the instanced content from the past expansions,  the completely revamped zones and leveling, Dungeon finder etc etc. I dont see Blizzard removing all these features. Not only would it look bad for them, and it would actually cause alot of casuals to stop playing too imo. 
---
The only real option would be starting a brand new mmo, maybe with a different IP, but that wont happen either. At this point, I really dont care what happens to retail sadly. It isn't something I see myself ever going back to.
---
You shouldn't be arguing this topic as you clearly haven't ever looked into it.
---
-Undead Rogue 
---
-Male Nelf Hunter 
---
-Any bald human male character with beard (soy style)
---
I mean if it was Asmongold I totally would have that reaction too haha but seriously that is a bit ridiculous. Watching streamers (mainly Towelliee and Sloot) like hypes me up for WoW and makes me want to play more.
---
Yes, everyone has friends to play with at the very start of Classic. It is known.
---
Which is why they want servers in which the official channels speak their native language.
---
holy shit you think this is absurdly detailed?
---
This was one of the easiest things to test. Also likely would have noticed quickly if you played Vanilla.
---
Aaaaand your IQ is lower than your vanilla character level.
---
The purpose of layering is to reduce the massive overcrowding that's going to come with tourists. That's something that's likely going to last for weeks.
---
You'll be exiting the starting zones in a matter of hours. How does simply moving the overcrowding to a different zone deal with the issue of overcrowding at all?
---
Honestly, I do not like layering. Or sharding. Or anything that divides the community, but I recognize that it's a much lesser evil than the alternative: A basically unplayable launch event followed by dozens of dead servers.
---
In complete contrary to the expansions
---
I swear some people act contrarian for the sake of being contrarion.
---
All of Wraths release raids were cleared 3 days into the expansion, many guilds didn't even have a full roster of max level players.
---
That expansion gutted this game's difficulty curve.
---
If I'm so wrong at least one of you should be able to provide some evidence?
---
Yes proving someone wrong by simply showing them demand for their own product leads to “multiple people suffering” ...
---
Sadly I'm EU
---
&gt;even though I'm 100% correct
---
That's a subjective opinion my friend.
---
&gt;and you're just mad. Pathetic
---
You feel sad that people have been shitting on your favourite incarnation of a game and then you go ahead and talk to people like this. No shit nobody likes you ...
---
&gt;France and Germany have English as a required language in their school curriculum. So we are catering to a vast minority of people if we don't account for the stubborn ones that refuse to use their English
---
They also dub almost every bit of media in their own language and a lot of people that don't use English in relation to their job simply forget what they learned in school over the years because they don't use what they learned... like ever.     
---
It did get better in recent years though.
---
Sneaking around, carefully scouting the arear to see if you can kite-kill something without pulling additional mobs. That was fun. 
---
In Legion I just hopped on my Pally and pulled everything in view. Got to the high level elite part, did the exact same thing. Sure the random rare elites were tougher, but not harder, just took more time.
---
“most c*cked combinations” what does that even mean?
---
The people who want there to be FR/DE/ES servers are usually the English speaking population that don't want their chats flooded by jajajajaja sacre bleu etc.
---
Is it slow leveling as prot ? I mean...slower...
---
I didnt downvote you, it was likely others due to your tone.
---
Will forever be a classic (no pun intended)
---
Comparatively, they were. We get it though, you're an elite gamer
---
Based on surveys, rogues will be one of the least played classes.
---
Yup. This is not a debate. "Difficult" is relative - and they were quite objectively more difficult than WotLK heroics. Or are you suggesting players *pretended* to find them difficult?
---
Queue for RFC? What? They included a dungeon finder? That's not the classic experience I remember lol
---
I know, that's what I meant. Sorry if it was not clear.
---
There should be no changes between the version and vanilla had FR servers.
---
Well yeah, and the alternative to that is layering that people don't like either.
---
Except servers should have only 3K simultaneous players max (once layering end). The game isnt playable without tweaking too many thing if you have too much people.
---
Also, you are underestimating the number of people that don't/can't speak english. For example about half the French don't know any english words according to some stats. I know there was some on private server that couldn't play with anyone except other french because of that and i expect the number to be alot higher on official realm because to get on a private server you have to follow some english instruction (high barrier of entry).
---
Has blizzard made a statement why they are not planning to release language specific realms?
---
he’s also not talking about the fact the he instantly downvoted me but then re-upvoted to make it seem like he didn’t, thinking i wouldn’t see it
---
blizzard's official stance is to remove layering before the end of phase 1
---
Boy nothing says friendly like telling people you’re friendly.
---
🤯 But those exploits are just supplementary problems that stem from the main problem of the world becoming sharded and losing its integrity.
---
Original developers were hesitant to add dungeons, raids and battlegrounds to the game for that same reason... But this new crew seems to be operating from fundamentally different premises. Instead of releasing 1.12 and looking back, they seem to be releasing 1.12 and looking forward to WotLK era... 🧐
---
Okay even if that was the case (it's not), do you not see that there are individuals in charge of game design at the top that realize exactly how poorly it would reflect on them if everyone started playing classic? They aren't stupid.
---
Maplestory has a feature like this, they call them “channels” whenever you’re looking for a map to grind levels or whatever, it’s not uncommon to have to cc hop until you find one without people.
---
Seems like you only played them post need. I remember people wouldn't run Stonecore because most pug tanks couldn't do the mechanics right. It was like Arcatraz all over again.
---
Fuck weapon skills, stupid back then and stupid now. Annoying, not immersive, it was a mechanic people found out how to cheese level very early on because it sucked.
---
https://youtube.com/watch?v=Q-GobXQTf6w Blows my mind that this wasn't common knowledge.
---
&gt; That's a subjective opinion my friend.
---
No. What I write and how you interpret written text is not subjective. When I write "The people who are behaving like assholes are assholes" and you interpret that as me saying "Everyone who plays retail is an asshole" then you are just plain wrong. Objectively. 
---
&gt;You feel sad that people have been shitting on your favourite incarnation of a game and then you go ahead and talk to people like this. No shit nobody likes you ...
---
Pathetic. I stick with that. You're an idiot and you apparently cannot comprehend simple written text. Not even if I explain it to you like I would to a 5 year old. You stick with your ridiculous misinterpretation of what I wrote and blame it on me.
---
I'm done with you, not gonna argue with someone who lacks basic reading comprehension. Been there before.
---
&gt; Am i wrong?    
---
Yes.    
---
Layering only exists in currently heavily populated locations. People still have to group to complete instance, elite quests, and similar. Additionally in areas where a realm is heavily populated there will still be tons of opportunities to interact with people since layering only spreads population rather than removes it or isolates a player.
---
Perfectly*
---
I can distinctly remember graphical pop-in occurring all the time during classic.  I can't say with certainty that it specifically happened here, but it was most certainly a large problem.
---
Yes they were compared to the ones before them.
---
&gt; Historicly not true, but i get your point!
---
But that is **because** there were alternatives on the official realms or rules enforing "english only" on unofficial realms in combination with an overall bigger english-speaking community because it wasn't EU-only.
---
I think you underestimate the size of the french and german communities when compared with the english-speaking one.
---
A gif is a series of pictures, my dude.
---
&gt;It‘s not like you arent’t allowed to speak german
---
Which is exactly the problem.
---
Thanks you! I watched one vid on YouTube for about a minute and haven’t stopped getting these videos recommend since !
---
Hahhahaa, the plan
---
So people from different realms cant see me talk in general chat right? If im looking for peeps to group with in my realm?
---
Was a good time on server 3, we tried to drag him to Thrall a room and almost made it before shut down.

Pally/warlock stomps all over pally/warrior
---
I never understood why undead horses still had their blinders on when they don't have any eyes.
---
Yeah this sounds like something I want to do as well. I played SL lock as I loved demo in Vanilla. I never finished a Nemesis set though. I started playing a warrior near the end. 
---
Felhunter is a pretty solid pet all around as demo though. Still decent auto attack damage, and can find rogues. Obviously OP as fuck vs all things magic. Only issue would be warriors at that point.

---
We can and will do the same, but it is called an MMO.
---
We want to interact with thousands of people on the server, not just the 1/5 we can understand and the handfull of people in the guild.
---
Layering has nothing to do with cross-realms. There's no cross-realm functionality at all except PvP.

Because some people want to speak their own language not just with their friends but also with pick-up group, people questing or in their guild.
---
I mean for exemple I speak all day at work in english and I like the idea of playing in french after work and making jokes relevant to french popular culture. Is that so hard to understand?
---
I'm not a native English speaker. I do not speak German, French, Spanish or Italian either as my first language. My native language is insanely small. So yes, I've made my peace with the fact that if I want to communicate with people, I'll speak English, because yes, most people you interact with, especially online do speak English.
---
I really, really advocate national servers because the difference between my language and German, French, Spanish, Italian? These are huge languages, with insane amounts of people speaking them. And there are people who very, very much are still used to the fact that they don't have to speak English and do not want to speak English and WILL NOT speak English. And I do not want to be on a realm that will be majority German or French and get kicked out of every party because I do not speak that language.
---
The class design is the worst aspect of retail for me. All the classes are indistinguishable from the others. Also, the talent  vs spec system is horseshit. It ruined character creation for me. I loved mapping out my talents, creating a spec that I chose, a character that reflected MY decisions during leveling. Now, they decide which abilities and spells I get based on their idea of a shadow priest. No more hybrid specs,  not more individuality....just a thousand gingerbread men in fancy wrappers.
---
Oh, and the gear/ability score reduction sucks, too.
---
I certainly didn't reupvote you. I don't see why. You're talking straight out of your ass and accusing me of opinions that I neither hold nor exclaimed. Entirely grounded in your lack of reading comprehension.
---
It takes a special kind of person to read
---
&gt;I know it's not all retail players that are like this [insulting classic lovers], but the ones who are can go fuck themselves
---
as "I hate all retail players and they're stupid for liking their game"
---
The bug was reported just recently, I’m sure it will be looked into like every other reported bug. There are alot of steps for a bug to go through on the development side until it’s fixed, fully tested and deployed to production. And depending on it’s complexity this process can take days or even weeks. 
---
It’s a beta environment which means things are allowed to be broken, repeating ”just fix it” does nothing but annoy the shit out of people. Have some patience.
---
It’s not about efficiency per skill, it’s more that with the way spirit tap works and by stacking spirit gear you can essentially kill a monster without losing any health and then regen your mana to near full before pulling the next monster.
---
50% of a mobs health will just be killed by a wand, so the priest will already be regenning mana under five second rule before they gain spirit tap and then be getting real big ticks by the time the mob dies.
---
Both sides have had insufferable people for many years now.
---
It’s time to get over it and develop some emotional maturity.
---
So you say it‘s a problem that you are allowed to speak german? Makes no sense to me.
---
That's hilarious, your clip doesn't even say what you claim it does.  There's no mention whatsoever of it being extended.
---
I used to smoke weed and heal as a shaman, apparently it was a stereotype
---
A few weeks would be the best case scenario and even that is way too long for people to exploit farming several times more resources. 
---
Everything that layering does can be accomplished through realms and once they get emptier, like you said, you simply merge them just like layers would merge. If it's a technical reason as to why having layers as opposed to realms is more convenient, then display the separate layers and allow a limited number of layer swaps (1-3) so people can join up with their IRL friends in the same Azeroth. Also, implement a restriction such as having to be in a capital city or logged off for 30 min before you can swap to another layer. 
---
40 people fighting for 1 quest has nothing to do with layering, but rather the population cap. Layers can have caps and so can realms. 
---
3-4 weeks of layering is a disgusting phase 1 which will have an effect on phase 2 due to people having a lot more resources gathered up (like a bear that's been gathering way too much food for the winter - it's overpowered). 
---
Hear me out. :)
---
Same. I guess being shat on for a quite a while at least pays off now that this thing finally gets the exposure it needs to for people to see how damaging this thing is to Classic.
---
I claimed they said for a limited time and then they changed the plan for months with layering. All facts.
---
Why female orcs though?
---
Add more servers?
---
Let's be honest here, layering is not here to solve any gameplay issues, it's to make profit and prevent costly "manual" merges or having to create and maintain separare server structure for the Classic version.
---
Thanks! It's in there but it does look like there's an issue around it. It ended up flagged as horde-only so you can't see it on an alliance character. Would that be the case for you?
---
Yea I agree. I find the fact that some classic lovers use their victory (getting classic servers) to shit on retail lovers as they did on them  sadly ironic.
---
Another argument (which I dont see mentioned) for adding these language servers is that the ones that has the most to loose is the language specific server players. So why dont give them what they want.
---
I'd love to, but I gotta work with my current salary and bills
---
Our whole guild is going to roll on the same server. We're still playing retail, but will have Classic Nights, Classic Events and things like that mixed in with our normal raid schedule. 
---
My son was a baby when Classic was out and he's now a regular raider in our retail guild. He's looking forward to seeing what the fuss is all about. 
---
That being said, I think there is an element of "rose coloured glasses" that will be evident within the first month. There are many quality of life additions to the current game, whose lack will be irritating to players that never played the original. Further, I think many people remember the game in a nostalgic light. It was cutting edge and amazing and huge back then. That magic has come and gone and cannot be recaptured since it is clearly an experience to which we are accustomed. 
---
It will be fun for us, since we are bringing our community with us. Hope you all have a good time too.
---
Keep your feet on the ground...
---
You are insanely wrong. Stop talk about PvP meta, dad gamer.
---
Because theyre not a 3rd world country, highly developed, im assuming they learn english in school early on just like other well-developed countries heck i learned german in school id be hella surprised if they dont even learn english.

Nothing says I was being rude than saying "you were being rude" with absolutely 0 effort put into pointing out where that happened.

So where did it change?  He says "a few weeks" in that interview, he uses exactly those same words against in may 2019.

Every time I mouse over something, it glows.  Every time I see an NPC, there's a little scrawl of text over their head so small I can 't read it.  The right side of my screen is covered in quests I didn't complete 5 years ago, and the first thing I saw was a flipping pop up telling me to go to twilight highlands.
---
I'm sure I can tweak all that out, but just logging in and looking like a rainbow vomited all over my screen was a real turn off.  Sure, Anduin Wrynn looks great when you can actually see his model, but the UI is so over designed my first task is to start poking around in menus to figure out how to turn all that crap off.
---
Sorry bud, that didn't come across for me. Carry on :)

i feel like the leeway and Batching is insane complex, but i just hope for this to get better, gonna be a sad experience to play mage if it stays the way :&lt;

Im missing something obvious i think.  She quit because they’re making her work over lunch...what relates to WoW? Please hold the sarcasm this time.
---
Classic will not be enjoyable for everyone.
---
Game's dead
---
There's nothing "perfect" about it. OP assumes the hype is not enough to clog the servers, and believes the only "fix" is a cooldown on switching layers. The often talked about "only switch layers in inns/main cities" is a really good solution and ignored by him. He says queues and dynamic respawns are enough, but that wont stop dead servers from people leaving the game.
---
Layering deserves criticism, but that thread is bad.
---
AU has less people than the EU, enjoy your US servers.
---
I agree with the comic but everyone must realize all the wow factors are gone. No one will feel that excitement of “what’s next???” anymore. Everything is old content and everything will be cleared extremely fast. 
---
I’m just as excited as all of you for classic but don’t be a little bit surprised if you find yourself a little bored after you guild full clears MC 2 weeks after release.
---
Shadow destroy in pvp too tho.
---
On average yes. Some servers had 25k some had 5
---
Queued for RFC? You can't queue in classic.

The vast majority of those generally have no clue how vanilla WoW actually was

The good old malediction bitch spec... that I intentionally specced into during Tbc because I loved the idea of my warlock being a support character without being a conventional healer or tank.  Same reason I loved dual pistols in TSW.

---
Yeah wait till you find out what you have to do to get into raids.
---
Honestly boys i get your points but if there will be 1 or 2 other specific language server then there should be a server for each language in europe. There are 40+ countries in europe each with at least 1 official language so it will be hard to achieve. 
---
I dont see the issue of specific language communities get on a server even if it is english one and make it their own. I remember back in early wrath ragnaros eu slowly became a danish server for example so why not do the same.
---
I didn’t know that about World Buffs.
---
Yes that can all be adjusted.  Doesn't mean the game looks like garbage.  That's all ui and layout that you have issue with, not the game itself
---
Wait I never thought about that happening lmao
---
It’s not mana efficient if you try to kill mobs with spells, you won’t need mana if you dot, mind blast + wand tho.
---
Content inflation and monopoly
---
Imagine having realms where 30% of the people playing cant communicate with each other because of the language barrier. I
---
did it lag?
---
&gt;I remember back in early wrath ragnaros eu slowly became a danish server for example so why not do the same.
---
Because it sucks if you spend weeks or months on aserver just to find out it is the unofficial danish server if yaou aren't danish yourself
---
This. This is why I haven't played wow I years. I keep trying to log in and play but it's just not the same. I was honestly under the impression my rose goggles had worn off, but this is refreshing and makes me super excited to get back into it one Classic WoW

&gt; No. What I write and how you interpret written text is not subjective. When I write "The people who are behaving like assholes are assholes" and you interpret that as me saying "Everyone who plays retail is an asshole" then you are just plain wrong. Objectively.
---
It's objective in the sense that people have been downtalking classic in the past. It's completely subjective to say you're 100% correct when you write stuff like:
---
&gt;All these "rose tinted goggles" assholes can go get beat up in an alleyway for all I care

Death begets death begets death. I hope you're familiar with it.

&gt;Pathetic. I stick with that. You're an idiot and you apparently cannot comprehend simple written text. Not even if I explain it to you like I would to a 5 year old. You stick with your ridiculous misinterpretation of what I wrote and blame it on me.
---
You spew hatred around like it's a 5 o'clock news report. We can discuss matters without personal insults and belittling of others. As strange as it may sound, there are folks just like you sitting behind the screens.
---
I did not misinterpret your thoughts. I simply disagree with your generalization of a vocal minority and your idea of "eye for an eye" politics.
---
&gt;edit: Holy shit you're not even the same person. Not sure if that's more or less sad.
---
Why is that sad? Am I not allowed to chime in with my own thoughts into a conversation?
---
&gt;Go read a fucking book and learn some reading comprehension instead of pissing on me for your lack of it.
---
I've read quite a lot of books recently, but thank you. I never said you were generalizing the entire retail playerbase, yet your opinion on a matter is subjective, you're an individual in a crowd. Your opinion can be objective until the point of "hating on the old game happened" and then enters the territory of subjectivity the moment you go "can go get beat up in an alleyway for all I care". I'm sorry you feel this way.
---
You really should calm down. Take a deep breath.
---
O'rly? And when did I state that I didnt want non-English servers?
---
What I said was that when classic released they had dedicated language servers and it was against the TOS to speak other languages in the main chat channels. 
---
I also stated that even when you dont have dedicated languages, a single language often rises to prominence and effectively becomes the soley used language in general chats because everyone understands it's easier to do it that way.
---
Lastly I stated that IF they released English servers only... it wouldnt stop people from other nations playing the game or creating guilds and social groups for people who preferred to speak their mother tongue on a day to day basis in-game.
---
This is what I hate about reputations in modern wow at least, not being able to grind out how much you want since its limit on daily quests or what its called now. I like the Vanilla way instead since Its mostly killing or grinding a few items whenever you want and how much you want. + The chance of getting something very special or other items that sell for a decent amount
---
The real issue is money.
---
&gt; you simply merge them just like layers would merge
---
This takes too many resources. Remember, thry already removed GMs and automated reporting system. It's much more cost efficient to let already existing server system (from Retail) to handle players.
---
&gt; display the separate layers and allow a limited number of layer swaps (1-3) so people can join up with their IRL friends in the same Azeroth
---
This would mean that there is unused server potential because the layers would have to stay there less populated off peak hours. Not enough profit.
---
I'm not worried about the exploits, it's the game world integrity that is much more precious and effective than economics.
---
Lol jaded as fuck. Go have some coffee and enjoy the ridd man.
---
I just want to make a simple non inflammatory point and ask a simple question.
---
Question: 
---
when a person makes decision to visit a foreign country that doesn’t speak in the same language, should  that same person expect the people of said country to accommodate them or should they prepare themself and learn the language prior to visiting the foreign country.
---
Point: 
---
blizzard is an American company, they are not obligated to provide any language format other English. 
---
I personally do not expect any country, person or buisness to accommodate me, I feel like this is the “everyone gets a trophy”mentality, that is plagued by a certain generation.
---
Noone said it wouldn't be. The point is to reduce queues from 5hrs to 30 mins and have hundreds of players in starting zones, not thousands.

---
I gave an alternative friend don’t shoot me down :)  
---
I firmly believe in what i said above there should be only english servers or one server for each language of the eu because then we will still run in unofficial server language if we have only french, italian and german language servers.
---
sad to see that blizzard servers are worse than pservers :(
---
Why only one server for every language?
---
Some languages are more popular than others you know

But there is no such thing as their chat. It’s called EU servers, not british servers. Everyone is free to talk in their own language. So who cares what they want? Just ignore them. They aren‘t in a position to tell others what to do or not. 
---
I also think intolerante people who behave like that are a minority. Most people are cool and friendly. That‘s at least my experience with international gaming communities.
---
Definitely not. But I did die a shit load of times in helfire penninsula from rogues I used to own in 1v1s
---
I mean... same. But I'm just playing FFXIV and their new xpac until Classic because I'm a filthy weeb.
---
I plan to play a Druid. What is this mouseover macro? I know nothing about macros
---
For soloing and leveling they're fine. Especially since the hunter can feign death to reset threat.
---
A turtle has very strong armor with their shield wall ability.
---
The biggest problem is that pet threat is extremely low lategame as it barely scale with gear (only a few set bonuses apply to pets).
---
How is this blatantly untrue from literally every shred of info theyve released but is still top comment with 9 upvotes XD
---
Waiting for an hour is nothing compared to the problems of layering.
---
I don't get the big deal. Just queue from work and log in once you get home.
---
Yeah, in vanilla you had to know how to play your class and have a at least basic knowledge of how the mechanics worked to be successful. Nowadays you can turn off your screen, roll your face over the keyboard and still succeed...
---
There were just so many people going after the same stuff in the starting zone. I thought it would be oddly funny, at the same time appropriate and more efficient to do the quests like a raid. But what you were suggesting sounds entertaining and would be fun, especially if there is another stress test.
---
Devilsaur leather will always be the best gold making on a fresh server. That set is preraid bis for warrior/druid/rogue/hunter.
---
&gt; 10 years old speak fluid english becous of video games now a days)
---
That's such a wrong statement.
---
Of course you have some countries where some 10yo can speak basic english quite well but let's not pretend they speak "fluid english" 
---
I mean have you played Overwatch and listen to audio chat where children barely manage to say coherent phrases in the heat of things? have you played LoL where outside of 'fucking jungler gank my lane' people are butchering English with 13 mistakes every two words
---
I noticed he's playing FFXIV in the background. What are his thoughts on that game?
---
This doesn't bother me. If you want to adrees me talk in English if not talk in whatever language you want.
---
Any """solution""" that requires restricting the amount I can play with my friends is only making the problem worse. Like putting out a fire with gasoline.
---
The most sensible actual solution I've seen so far is to only be able to switch in rested areas.
---
OP never said "single picture".
---
[Here](https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-testing-schedule/49664) \- that's an EU one but it is the same worldwide.
---
If I need a secretary I will call for you. Meanwhile, go frack yourself.
---
Seems like a bad idea tbh. People will go do there mining/other gathering prof route, head to a inn in the zone and swap layers, rinse and repeat. No down time, a million resources. Seems great for the economy.
---
Come on don’t be like this :) i meant at least one for each language hope we can agree now
---
Your statements ending in question marks that don’t require them are aggressive. You misinterpreted a person’s simple joke and responded unnecessarily defensively. When someone called you out on it, instead of acknowledging it you decided to argue with the other commenter as a bizarre means of saving face on the Internet. Hope that clarifies things.
---
I wouldnt claim that modifiers are one button.
---
Theres more than enough actionbar space to not need modifiers where a separate button could yield more clarity (bound with a modifiers)
---
Most of your macros are for keyboard space, and modifiers are for visual space. Important distinction
---
No, it will be English just like on pservers. 
---
I understand that you want to push your point to the extreme that everyone will staunchly use their native language to make international server idea look bad, but it's not true :)
---
But we have to be the nazi zombies.
---
He should will of forsaken the sheep.
---
You're not wrong.
---
No, it's not wrong. It's just that the way you put it implies that the target audience was totally changed.
---
&gt; The games are made for different audiences 
---
I was saying that this is not the case, and while the majority of current Retail players are the target audience, there is still a good part that will also be the audience for Classic, even if they play Retail now.
---
Maybe not 30-40%, maybe less, but still, there is a part, of the current retail player base that will change to Classic.
---
Retail is a fast food impersonation of the original game, where everyone has become the hero, and every multiplayer content has been nerfed to the point where a mindless keyboard smasher can complete it.
---
There is no story in classic, the only story is you trying to survive this brutal place and get a little bit stronger.
---
Was also thinking of italy (mainly south of rome) where english is pretty rare. But no idea how many people from that region play wow...
---
It makes perfect sense to have everyone speak the same language. It's not intolerance or anything of the like. It is just annoying to have to filter through a bunch of messages you dont understand in order to get to ones that make sense to you. You probably don't read Russian novels in Russian either if you don't understand them - you get a translated version to read.
---
Having language separated servers is the only thing that makes sense.
---
Just put intercept on a separate bar.
---
Thats how I do it for cd's in forms on live.
---
This macro still gives you a very effective bind
---
And I’m 14
---
I actually ripped out Isha Awak's tooth after killing her! https://imgur.com/inDDB8h
---
You can, and both communities certainly have people who get too mad about what other people enjoy. But also, only one of those communities has actually been historically serviced.
---
It's a little disappointing to read the comments all over this thread about how they've never seen retail players with this opinion. I mean, its a good thing that this attitude isn't as prevalent as it maybe once was, but at the same time the retail community has a massive history of shitting on vanilla wow. And it stings to see people who clearly only joined this community only a month or two ago run around and spout about how it never happens. 
---
Classic has legitimized a lot of this communities complaints, but before it existed, we were treated like shit by both the retail community and by blizzard. It's not surprising that there is still some bitterness there.
---
This movie was such a disappointment considering how good Aslan looked
---
Other guy says im wrong. Now im confused.
---
Locked layers would be just like Vanilla realms, but just grouped under realm names. The real issue is that they don't want to support that many realms/layers, because it's too expensive and because they want to support BfA and Classic with similar server structure.
---
&gt; mouseover macro
---
Google that, look at an article and/or video - much easier than me giving you an explanation.
---
Why is flying always part of the "problem". Its part of MMO's and a standard in the industry. The stronger you get the faster you do things. Flying is part of the power curve. It "hurts" what exactly? World pvp? Almost no one does that anyways in retail and we dont even have flying yet.
---
Newwwww CRAKC
---
&gt; The german community is already planning a take over of several EU realms.
---
Like a Blitzkrieg? So the French will surrender, the Polish will be removed and the remainder of the server divided up between the Germans and the Russians?
---
I support your decision to abstain.
---
My wife won't be playing either, you two can hang but leave the Fedora at the door.
---
Current WoW, with sharding is not even an MMO.
---
Current WoW is...I have no idea what, but it's not massive, is not multiplayer, and clearly not RPG.
---
It is online...but that is about as far I can go with trying to label current WoW.
---
Yeah, he's polling worse than all 5 top democratic primary contenders; people seem to be seeing through his egocentric bullshit. 
---
Annoying that is has to be brought up in a sub dedicated to a game great for escaping such real world drama...good ol' sycophants.
---
And you learned all of this duting a stresstest? I agree with the points made, but this doesn't  seem that legiy
---
&gt; Death begets death begets death. I hope you're familiar with it.
---
"for all I care". It's a personal statement, marked as such and ranting. I'm not threatening anyone and telling me I'm a bad person because I'm frustrated with years of abuse by people who wanted to deny me the game I love is just asinine.
---
&gt;As strange as it may sound, there are folks just like you sitting behind the screens.
---
Then be respectful to me and I'll be respectful to you. I've been on the internet for long enough not to let some trolls insult me while I stay polite. If you want to have a proper discussion, don't accuse me of shit I very explicitly did not write - that I even very explicitly EXCLUDED from what I wrote. 
---
&gt;I simply disagree with your generalization of a vocal minority
---
It's hilarious how your brain is still incapable of comprehending that saying "the people who insulted classic lovers" is just targeting exactly these people - the ones who insulted us. Not the others. I'm not generalizing - no matter how much you want to project that onto me.
---
&gt;Why is that sad? Am I not allowed to chime in with my own thoughts into a conversation?
---
It's sad that there are 2 people utterly incapable of properly reading what I write, accusing me of the same stupid shit that I EXPLICITLY ruled out. And you STILL do. Like - how daft are you? How often do I have to cite the passage that clearly says "Not everyone who plays retail is an asshole, but there are some retailers who very extremely vile towards classic lovers and this specific sub-group of retail lovers can f themselves"?
---
What does it take for your moron brain to comprehend this? How could I not get angry with 2 twats continuously accusing me of saying the exact opposite of what I actually said? Am I supposed to be happy with this? Say "Thanks for maliciously misrepresenting my argument and attacking me for it!" ?
---
&gt;"can go get beat up in an alleyway for all I care"
---
If you're so freaking sensible towards rants like this, if you take this so freaking literal and personal, maybe don't go on the internet. It's an emotional topic for me. Me and others here have literally been verbally attacked by people who wanted to stop classic from happening for YEARS and now you're getting pissy because I'm mad at them? Get lost dude. I'm not having this conversation.
---
We played 1000s of hours when it first came out and have waited 12 years for it to come back.
---
&gt; Layering only exists in currently heavily populated locations 
---
No it doesn't, it exists in entire continents. As long as durotar is heavily populated there will still be several layers of tanaris.
---
And I’m 41
---
I feel you guys but in all honesty - I live in Berlin, cant speak German and it's 100% fine - I'm sure I can cope on a more international server.
---
It's for knowing if a trainer visit is even worth it.  If you're out in the world and the closest Trainer is 15 minutes and a hearth cooldown away, maybe you don't want to spend that time when the only things available at that level are Arcane Missiles and Conjure Food
---
I miss the daily quest comics
---
A normal classic server is 3k people.
---
A layered classic server is e.g. 15k people, on 5 layers.
---
Each layer is a full copy of the entire world. Think about each layer being an individual server, and "layer hopping" being "playing cross realm". You "layer hop" by being invited into a group, switching to the layer of the group. Currently you can also switch layers by relogging.
---
Why does Blizzard do that?
---
Many people assume that the population of WoW Classic will rapidly drop after a short time. That means these 15k people will become less and less each week. This allows Blizzard to reduce the layer number until there's only 1 layer left, the "main server". It also allows them potentially to create e.g. 30 layers for 15k people (instead of 5) during launch, so the starting areas are not full with hundreds of players. I don't think it's confirmed anywhere that they want to do that though.
---
Layering is supposed to go away after a few weeks when the population has balanced out, but no later then phase 2.
---

---
Just light hearted humor
---
Killing someone on a PVP server is not harassment. If you don't want to be killed play on a PVE server.
---
like bfa :)
---
&gt;I also stated that even when you dont have dedicated languages, a single language often rises to prominence and effectively becomes the soley used language in general chats because everyone understands it's easier to do it that way.
---
Yeah but its not an official language so you can speak other languages without it being against the ToS.
---
I know this is a spicy topic, but I wanted to give you the best answer I could in hopes of starting a productive conversation. We as a community NEED to get this right for launch to be successful... 
---
The way sharding works is in the simplest terms is that there is a certain number of players that should be on each shard in each area (not zone, think going from where Waycrest Manor pops up on your screen to the next closest area in Drust’var). When you move between areas, you move to a new shard. You’ve probably seen a lot of videos where people can’t do world quests because of sharding or phasing.
---
To the best of my understanding, layering is only supposed to affect the starting zones (1-12 zones). And the way it’s supposed to operate is that there will be a cap on each continent (not area or zone) for how many players can be active (let’s say 500) on that server to ensure that it will be viable to do quests, etc... Once the first layer is full, the 501st person would start layer 2. Originally, once all of those players move to Silverpine or the Barrens, they are supposed to fold the layers together. This makes the most sense in my head because as you level up there are more varied directions you can go for questing zones or grinding areas. 
---
I think layering only serves the purpose of making 1-12 remotely viable and should otherwise be no where in Classic WoW.
---
If anyone has heard a later update (with sources other than this subreddit’s rantings...), I would love to talk through it all. ❤️
---
I watched a few minutes of it. What he says feels right towards my feelings of the current game when I played through January-March before quitting because of how my schedual in the game was «formed». As he says in the video, I began only logging in 2 days for raiding and to get done with the weekly chest. Once I realized that I literally played that little each week and how I felt about it...I quit
---
Hard like heroic was good but I preferred M.A.G.E.
---
&gt;  The sense of danger is important to the experience.
---
You also leave with a sense of accomplishment once its complete.
---
Plus the succubus picture in the background :)
---
Most EU people brag about all the different languages they can speak because of the diversity of the location they live in.... So, what's the problem?
---
For mods: Its footage from beta so you dont think its Pserver footage the streamers is known in the Pserver community thats all!
---
Yeah, I really hope they go for that. If they're too scared about rested areas they could chose to only allow major cities, but I believe rested areas should work quite well.
---
It only "has" to keep your layer between reloggs, no matter what you do (unless your layer collapsed in the meantime).
---
Is general chat all layers or just for one?
---
Aslan wasn't in BfA. He was in the Narnia series.
---
I saw Avenue Q off Broadway in maybe 06 or 07, and yeah, absolutely hilarious.  Rated R Seasame Street.
---
Looks like his using spirit gear. Working as intended...
---
Old school runescape cannabilized the main game and is still going strong. There are enough players where people will still likely play both versions of WoW and hopefully results in a net subscriber increase.
---
And where are they now?

It's like mini servers within a server. You get invited to group from someone on another mini server and you get phased into that one.

Pve at first 
---
PvP later on
---
Out of curiosity maybe but I doubt it. I know what I'd pay money for.
---
I had no trouble doing the quests in Deathknell the first night (started about 3 hours after the stress test started).  
---
Mulgore the next night was basically a single-player experience.
---
oh boy
---
You mean for the beta? Invites only
---
The thought of ally healers wanting to be in range of raid bosses for extra dps makes me balk.
---
My heart is broken
---
I'm thinking about playing on 2 accounts at the same time, and just alt tabbing on the priest for heals and maybe to wand for extra dps.
---
Imagine if people put in as much effort in to learn each others languages as they do each others class mechanics and boss fights...
---
Raid gear is bound to your character when you pick it up. Most of it is used in both pve and pvp. There is gear sold on the AH but I cannot speak to its quality., it’s called BoE or bind on equip. There are also vendor which sell pvp gear which becomes available based on pvp rank
---
No thanks, European servers are most welcome. Merci beaucoup, muchas gracias, grazie mille.
---
You'll also need a time machine to go back to June 19th at 2:00 PDT.  Stress test is over, now.  Next one is July 18th.
---
Can you explain? So do you also get better gear for pve from pvp?
---
At lvl 15?
---
Yeah, right :D
---
Thank you. The way you explain it, at least if it were implemented that way doesn’t sound like such a bad thing. I remember playing vanilla launch and it was way over crowded to the point being annoying. This seems like it would be a good idea at least for first few leveling areas
---
Rank 10 and rank 13 gear 
---
But don’t count on getting those without a real commitment
---
Time for improve RP with the NPCs...
---
...and then the awkward silence when another player rides past and reads your conversations.
---
What about removing layering?
---
I just wish someone would put together a pre-dungeon BiS for lvl 60 characters/classes.  I keep reading the advise that after speed running to 60 I should join dungeon groups...
---
If I speed level to 60 on a server and there are not any tanks or healers at lvl 60 that really limits my ability to run dungeons.  The problem clears up in a couple weeks sure, but that is a LONG time in speed runner time.
---
At this point if I get unlucky enough to be on the wrong server where no healer or tanks speed level I'll just have to speed level an alt healer or tank after my main hits 60 I guess. Feed it some gear from what my main collected or can get from lower lvl dungeon farming for a few hours.
---
Tl;dr
---
Pre-dungeon BiS, waterlords rep grind, rapid attainment quests, grind money and/or crafting mats, level a useful alt.
---
So in short:
---
Tradeable gear is garbage
---
Pve gear is untradeable and a starter pvp gear as well
---
After you earb pvp ranks you can buy better gear, suited to pvp
---
exactly, just compare taurens on retail and classic.
---
it's like saying TF2 and overwatch have same artstyle.
---
Na
---
As a person in NA who only speaks English, I signed. I don't think it's AS bad as people say when they talk about how it will negativly effect them, but I do think it will improve many players experience for very little effort on blizzards part. With Layering there only needs to be one realm for each.
---
&gt;when deadzone was being removed from classes starting with the Hunter
---
Wat
---
&gt;I googled the patch notes and you can, too!
---
And yet you don't source the alleged proof for what everyone has been bitching about for over a month- FeelsWeird
---
All.
---
half of your arguments work for any new game where player are still stuck at the same level, leveling.
---
Can’t see an abuse here.
---
Because people are obsessed with getting more elves.
---
That wasn't how it was working on the stress test this week. You'd leave a busy area and the layer would disappear.
---
Easy. Void on one, fear the second, tank the third. Becomes easier if you can get your paws on a smoldering wand or something similar. It's harder in the 35-40 gap because your drain life doesn't quite hit hard enough without SM and Shadoweave gear.
---
Yeah, It's getting hard to wait.  I only reached level 6 because I didn't want to venture out of the starting zone and "ruin" the experience further for August.
---
My plans to make the next two months go by faster: 
---
\-  I'm taking a summer class 
---
\- Go outside - hike, grill, anything because I know I wont be going outside much in September :)
---
\- Fix up anything in the house before launch 
---
\- Any "adulting" that I've put off trying to get done
---
So what? this is how its always worked.
---
durrrr nO cHaNgEs lmao
---
Happens all the time. Dunno how I always come off as... whatever the tone is. I don't see anything wrong with what I'm saying. All I see is people not agreeing with me, and thus throw hate at me in one form or another. So childish.
---
no this was never the case in vanilla, I played it. I basically destroyed my late teen years playing vanilla wow. 
---
nothing was instanced layered or sharded in the open world, the technology didnt exist back then.
---
the reason why i remember this is due to the initial outrage when they did the first implementation of the sharding system. Many people were outrageous because that would destroy dueling in front of towns. I'd even look it up with the webs archive but i don't know the patch/date when the first iteration was implemented (maybe someone who knows can).
---
Another problem is THIS shouldn't even happen on the beta or in classic because thats not how LAYERING works, your gif basically shows sharding and that's not supposed to be in classic/beta
---
My only concern is that we hopefully don't have this even after layering is deactivated (and we shouldn't because it never existed back then as stated above) because there are still, according to the gif, working code fragments of sharding left.
---
This subs obsession with retail is fucking pathetic and childish
---
Alrighty thanks
---
&gt; Why is flying always part of the "problem".
---
Because flying causes huge problems to the gameplay that have been listed and discussed to death. I don't give a shit about the "standards of the industry". The mmorpg industry standards suck. This is why we want classic in the first place.
---
&gt;It "hurts" what exactly? World pvp? Almost no one does that anyways in retail and we dont even have flying yet.
---
Jesus really? Have you been under a rock in the 12-something years that people have been bringing up tons of points for why flying is bad for the game?
---
Here's a couple very grave issues that have been brought up a million times:
---
World PvP is dead. For some reason you acknowledge that it is dead but fail to realize that it is dead due to flying. It's kinda hilarious, really. wPvP was alive and well in classic (blackrock ganking, huge community of open world PvP videos, SS vs TM [though that one kinda died when dishonorable kills were introduced, not because of flying]) and then suddenly started dying down when people could AFK 500 meters in the air, CC someone, mount up and fly away or just straight up 'hide' in the air when you saw someone approaching. It's mind blowing how you bring "World PvP is dead" up as a pro flying argument. That's so twisted. Flying KILLED World PvP. That's why it's no longer there.
---
Trivialization of outdoor content. In classic, when there was a named mob at the end of a quest, you had to get to him. Walk through the entrance of the enemy camp and fight your way to the named mob you needed to kill before the mobs start respawning and overwhelming you. With flying, you just fly over the mob you need, dismount, kill him, mount up, fly back. 0 Danger, 0 organic quest progression, 0 fun. Just 100% efficiency. Great.
---
The world shrinks. At 310% movement speed, even huge zones become easy to traverse. You may not think that's a problem, but it is. It further kills World PvP (cause you cannot camp a commonly used road to ambush bypassers) but also kills immersion, as it severely cripples your perception of the scale of the world. Kalimdor is HUGE. Going from North to South in classic a long time. And even with the use of flight masters getting from A to B took longer, as the scenic routes that gave you a sense of the worlds size took longer than the straight line route so high up in the sky that you cannot see anything of the world anymore. 
---
&amp;Nbsp;
---
I think that should be enough. It's been discussed to death. These are 3 big points that I can think of off the top of my head. Flying has massively hurt WoW.
---
How is this abuse? There is tons of spirit gear in the game. The player is just using it in between combat.
---
They won't.
---
You give each guild a random name if there are collisions, just like how they do with player characters (currently they use it for people who hasn't played for a long time, so the name opens up for other players) that gets their name replaced by a random name.
---
You also give the players advance notice so that they can prepare and decide what to do.
---
As for PR, it's hardly an issue with merging if they handle it properly in the announcement. 
---
And no, in my opinion the downsides of merging servers are not bigger than layering. layering, and any other technology that splits up a realms popular, do far more damage and will ruin an MMO. It is a big part of what ruined retail wow in my opinion.
---
Because this is what will happen with almost every single player that started WoW after Wrath.
---
Dust hast!   Du hast blizz!  Du hast blizz because, du hast blizz because.
---
Me and the boys getting ready to attune to Onyxia
---
Because it’s not an abuse of game mechanics. It’s clever use of game mechanics. 
---
Thats what spirit does. Increased health and mana regen. Of course melee dps classes aren’t going to gear their characters for that because it gimps damage, but if you want to go out of your way to collect a spirit set to utilize in between pulls for regen then thats clever use of game mechanics. It’s too much trouble IMO.
---
is  that tauren feral druid?
---
it's ridiculous to think we don't need layering on launch. 
---
if you want to sit in queue for 6 hours and disconnect every 15 minutes **even if** you make it past the character creation screen then Idk what to tell you
---
I agree, people will be speaking english 99,5% of the time.
---
Did nobody read where they are testing different levels of layering or does everyone here just want to be a whiny little bitch baby?
---
a raid needs 3 warlocks. (curses)
---
Anyone got character race percentages? Could help some people pick their race.
---
spirit gear was pretty popular in our raid guild. It‘s not abusing. It‘s just clever use of game mechanics and a little effort to farm this gear.
---
Not necessarily, pve gear is good in pvp and there is also crafted gear which is BoE
---
Then it seems like old
---
Quality fucking meme
---
There is bop (bind on pick up) and boe (bind on equip) once equipped it becomes “soulbound”. No one else can equip it but you once it is soulbound. That means soulbound items can not be sold to the AH. BoE items can be sold if you do not equip them. BoP become soulbound the second you loot off a boss.
---
There is also set pieces which provide set bonuses. At end game there is Tier Pieces which offers a really good set bonus, but usually pretty rare as you can only get them in raids which reset weekly. Plus you’re fighting other people within that tier’s class. By this I mean each tier will have several different classes assigned to it ie (druid mage rogue).
---
The gear you earn from dungeons/raids is your best gear usually. However there will be gear you can earn from honor and depending on your flavor of playstyle you can choose how you earn your gear. Usually raiding at end game is most optimal.
---
&gt; Your statements ending in question marks that don’t require them are aggressive.
---
That's ridiculous. Don't project your own dickish behaviour on me. If I feel like someone is an asshole I'll call them that, as you can see in my post history. I'm not such a petty prick that I do passive aggressive questionmarks. 
---
Ironically you accuse me of attacking someone for misinterpreting their text while doing exactly that to me now. I'm done with this conversation. I'm not having you tell me how to interpret the stuff that I wrote. 
---
If you read everything so maliciously, that's more of a problem with you than it is with me.
---
I remember this from when I first started playing, it reminds me so much of my first WoW buddies, Stompsalot and Tabbytauren; I miss them a lot, the only gaming friends I was able to truly connect with.
---
L5? Like level 5?
---
Yes, I've already planned on going there to quest, do all quests I can find, and even look at rep guides to find those that exist elsewhere as well.
---
But will head over there at level 1. Will probably be level 2 or something by the time I get there, due to experience from exploring.
---
Thanks for wishing me good luck. I will become a Human Elf :)

Yea, if they say something that is even 0.001% inaccurate, we would drown in the wave of posts here made to bitch about it.
---
Kind of. There are a few tier 1 pieces that are tradable(BoE) and not garbage. But for the most part as you progress through raid content it will be replaced by BoP(not tradable) gear.
---
The PVP earned rewards have a healthy amount of stamina, which is why it’s better suited for that. However, depending on your class/spec and your ability to gear up some of the PVP pieces also have applicability in PVE because of the generous allotment of stats based on item level. 
---
Hope that helps. But my advice is don’t worry about gear too much, it will come with time. Do a healthy mix of PVE for some of the items you need and PVP as your heart desires.
---
Yeah cool, just wanted to point out that doing the NE starting zone is the single best decision you can make if you want to hit exalted with Darnassus!
---
Ahh, thanks for clearing that up
---
He was right, I meant that even though its only for phase 1 or early zone it matters.
---
Yes officer this comment right here.
---
thank you for getting my point across
---
Okay.
---
insane how so many people are defending blizzard. If pservers can run 15k pop with massive fights with little to no lags then it should be expected for blizzard to do better. Layering is a lazy excuse for bad servers imo. here are some clips from pservers and classic:   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYFD06UFscw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYFD06UFscw)  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPnMFJiOxT4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPnMFJiOxT4)

---
Man, why are you being such an ass lmao. Can’t wait to play in the great classic community with people like you.
---
Cancer.
---
it won't be 3000 players online at the same time. by the time you make it pas the 6 hour queue on launch you'll be disconnected after 15-30 minutes and end back up in a then 3 hour long queue. by the time you get to play you'll have cursed your surroundings and be hopelessly behind and frustrated that you waited 8 hours after launch to finally be able to play the game without issues
---
that’s... the matter of subjective taste just like new models. For someone like you a banana might taste better than chocolate peanut butter fondant pudding
---
Just take spirit tap and wand spec and it doesn’t matter what else you take.
---
Uhh what is your definition of downtime?Does the time he spends standing there waiting for his health to regen not count?
---
I see a lot of people doing this or playing the beta super hard. I just want to say remember it’s the beta. Those characters won’t be available on release so don’t burn yourselves out before the game even arrives. I’m super excited too but I would hate to see everyone burned out by the time the game releases. I don’t want to stop anyone from having fun I just want to issue a friendly warning to keep that in mind.
---
I was 12-13, i played wow and was raiding, my english was not good, but i got around... I mean, man op, learn english, or play another game, we already got wow classic... People just want more and more and more
---
inb4 post is removed
---
The difference is that Classic isn't even out yet and people are already doomsaying that it's going to """fail"""
---
Who cares?
---
Play on a private server
---
His analysis is fantastic. I never even thought about it this way but it feels exactly right. Increasingly, WoW has become exactly that. You have your bucked list of weekly things to do, do them and then you can have fun - if you still want to.
---
In classic you looged in and goofed around, did whatever you felt like. You never had that feeling of "I still need to do this before the reset". You did it whenever you felt like it for however long you felt like doing it.
---
What really strikes me is how young Lore and Ion seem next to Kevin and it's kinda reflected in their arrogance and their lack of experience and insight.
---
Most best gear is from pve but some is from pvp, depending on class and how hardcore you are. Basically you want to raid to get great pvp gear, but pvp gear often isn't better than what you get in raids except for the really top end pvp stuff for a while.
---
I‘m sorry but I still don‘t understand the problem. To me it‘s just not such a big deal to ignore or filter messages that are irrelevant to me. Isn‘t that something everyone of us does on a daily basis while reading stuff on the internet? 
---
Yep I don‘t speak russian and don‘t read russian novels. But it isn‘t an russian server but an EU server. You are allowed to write in german in general chat and others are allowed to write in spanish or whtever. If you too want to have a talk, you have to choose a language which both of you are fluent in. That‘s just the same as in real life isn‘t it?
---
Question: If you travel to a foreign country by choice that does not speak your language do you expect that country to accommodate you? do you expect said country to provide you a special set of road signs, restaurant menus, etc? I personally do not and I have been to various non English speaking countries.
---
Blizzard is an American Company, they obviously don’t feel inclined at this time to provide non English speaking servers. 
---
I do not search out games that are not in English and try to play them, but if I did I would not whine about it or expect them to change their product. 
---
This to me is the “everyone gets a trophy” mentality that is rampant among a certain generation.
---
You can, but it will require some heavy time investment to farm the gold that is required
---
Yeahs its better... But also fucking borring :P
---
BFA girl looks like the twilight chick lol
---
This is why dual spec was eventually implement because spending 100+ gold per week respecting is just not feasible. They should really lower the cap down to 25g IMO.
---
Yeah, that's pretty much expected.
---
Stockpile the shit out of high value consumables in Phase1 and sell them for a huge profit later on letting a few people dominate the AH with wealth accumulated early in server progression.
---
Come on bro, lay it out to me.
---
I write that I am mad at people who have abused the classic community for years. People accuse me of shit I never wrote. I defend myself. I am the asshole?
---
The hell is wrong with you?
---
feign death can be resisted though unless you're talking about other than when that happens
---
Look, I feel sorry for you. Really.
---
Retail is going to die on August 27th, 2019. Not saying that retail will close. No.
---
I am just saying most Retail players will swap to Classic or quit WoW for good. And those that will remain...won't have enough players to make raids. Most of them anyway. Not all. But most retail guilds will not going to be able to form raids after Classic is live.
---
And this will snowball, fast. Less and less players will play Retail. I know it, Blizzard knows it...and apparently you also know it.
---
I am sorry if the game you enjoy is going to die.
---
But this is life. A superior product will ALWAYS kill an inferior one.
---
On a vraiment besoin de serveur localisé . Le confort de jeux sera enormement degradé sinon . Dans une version du jeu ou tout le monde va devoir communiqué pour la moindre chose , et bien plus qu'a BFA , avoir des serveurs suivant les langues est indispensable 
---
Je parle anglais couramment , mais c'est loin d'etre le cas de beaucoup de monde . 
---
Quand vous allez grouper pour une instance avec un anglais , un allemand , un francais , un italien et un espagnol , et que aucun ne parle une langue commune ( l'anglais generalement )  , cela va vite devenir ingerable . 
---
De plus le recrutement de guilde pour monter un roster raid , cela va etre l'enfer !  un serveur ou les 3 / 4 des gens parlent une autre langue , le bonheur pour recruter des mecs pour du raid 40 
---
TL;DR : If you don't understand what i previously wrote , you now get why we need localised server . 
---
It's not " we don't like german or english people " , it's really " we NEED to communicate , whatever the langage we use " . 
---
I couldn't care less were you came from . But who server is not an Gaming version of " We are the world " . We need to be able to communicate with each other easily
---
Twitch kid located. But hey at least we are on the same page, you can go and floss with your favorite streamers, trading them gold in the hope they'll say your name and then leave us old fogeys to whine/complain in peace on our own realms.
---
That depends if you have competition, then its not gonna be the same.. Also devil farming makes you relie on other people alot more than lbrs running, this is a deal breaker for me atleast :)
---
Yeah I thought that but don't wanna spend time a on private server then in 2 months all that time is wasted more looking for an alternative altogether so I can look forward to classic
---
Wait no.. we were just getting deep .. wait that’s not what I meant either ...
---
he should delete his cloak and report a bug
---
Yes, so I think unless the americans come in with a D-Day, Azeroth might be conquered by Germany.
---

---
In Classic, I enjoyed this aspect of Vanilla. Forces you to post your role in pvp and pve!
---
Diantre ! we don't say sacrebleu since many year 
---
FICHTRE !
---
They can't bring classic things to retail though. That ship has sailed, can you imagine the uproar if they said 
---
"Here's our new expansion, Azeroths Rebirth, we're gutting the cross realm so a lot of realms are going to have to be shut down, those affected will need to pick their realm from the pre-approved list (bye bye many guilds) you'll no longer be able to queue for dungeons via an interface option instead form all groups manually and run across the world to enter. Reputation has been changed such that you get most of your rep from repeatedly killing the same mobs over and over, up to the thousands."
---
That's me just picking a couple of random things out of the air that they would need to do to get close to putting classic into retail and they would as likely kill the game as anything else. BfA relies on it's casual playerbase and that playerbase barely make non LFR raids, do you honestly think they would stick around to do a Thorium Brotherhood style grind to get their next shiny mount or pet? They'd ditch the game.
---
It’s the tried and true victim complex mixed with the superiority complex.
---
I don't know if this is a bug or feature, but please keep this!
---
Q
---
1) the way they teach us English is broken. I learned English at school for about 10 years, when I went to England it's like I was in China ! I learned 90% of my English skills by watching US TV shows and reading on the web.
---
2) 99.9% of them don't need it in their every day life, so the few things they learned at school disappear quickly.
---
Looks like retail.
---
I would say I'm realistic, maxing profit at the cost of player experience.
---
The entire point of Watch Dogs was to be a modern day Assassin's Creed. There's even a mission in it where you hit the CEO of Abstergo, and in black flag you can hear Abstergo employees talking about Blume.
---
Lol, people can play both. It isn't a "us vs them". You take gaming way too seriously...
---
Also swapping gear back and forth. And if it’s a PvP server leaving himself vulnerable with a non optimal gear set. Too much trouble IMO, just eat some food for a few secs.
---
That's just r/wow, they shit on everything, it doesn't matter if it classic or retail
---
We have 9 years of getting shit on to make up for it.
---
The audience of private servers and retail blizzard servers is vastly different.
---
pservers is a niche within a niche and your average soccer mom and dad who only plays on official servers does not and will not speak english.
---
And even counting people like that out 99,5% is never gonna happen.
---
Frostbolt.....Frostbolt....Frostbolt....Leveling maybe but im not so sure you want to make this a blanket statement.
---
“Content relating predominantly to private servers and the private server community should be posted in r/WoWServers. This includes encouraging others to join or switch to a private server.”

Spell batching affects all actions, not just spells.
---
Agreed. Would love to come across a cloth wearing spirit geared warrior out in wpvp hah.
---
"And adults who play video games are pathetic" adults who dont play talking about you
---
What are you talking about, Brewmaster was overall the best tank the entire expansion, they we're the best in the first (Mogushan, Terrace and Heart of Fear) and second(Throne) tier, are we second best tanks in the last tier, Siege of Orgrimmar behind warriors.
---
I agree with your point of view, but i also think that living in europe (2019) and not speaking english is kinda your own fault... And it shouldt be blizzards problem
---
Aye, it’s been a few months since I’ve been able to log on regular WoW in a consistent fashion with all the hype building up.
---
Dont broadcast your location to the world then
---
Have sex
---
For pure PvP nothing beats double rogue or double mage. The amount of burst and cc they have is criminal.
---
But if you are looking for fun all around and are set on warrior any healer class will do the job. In PvP paladin does take the cake. The magic and poison removal is huge for warriors. The blessing of sacrifice makes you immune to most CC.
---
What’s the point of it being called a vanilla private server when it doesn’t have vanilla mechanics? That makes no sense. X15 xp and shit make it nothing like vanilla. Mind as well go play retail wtf
---
Knowing english or not is one thing, you forget about the part where people from a country will form communities on a server and they will talk in their native tongue in said communities even if they know english.
---
If you were to move to Europe into an American community, you would speak English for the most part in the community, you would only speak the language of the country you are in when talking to the locals or at work.
---
I’ll answer the question with the assumption you know next to nothing about how the gear works (not trying to insult or anything). Gear has two general categories with many subcategories from my point of view: it is either Bind on Pickup (BOP) or Bind on Equip (BOE). BOP means the gear, once looted from the source, is bound to that character. BOE binds to the character once it is equipped and thus can be traded or sold. Garbage gear (grey and white in color) can be traded once equipped but in general is useless and can be vendored for gold; as such it won’t be considered beyond that.
---
From there the first kind of subcategory is the type of gear: weapons and armor. Each class has access to certain, but not all, weapon and and armor types. Weapons can be one handed, two handed, and ranged. Weapons include polearms, staves, daggers, swords, maces, axes, bows, crossbows, guns, thrown, and wands. Armors include cloth, leather, mail, and plate. You can look into each class to see which gets access to certain weapons and armor types.
---
Beyond that, gear has a tier system. It increases in power/rarity (generally) from grey (low quality) to white (common), green (uncommon), blue (rare), purple (epic), and finally orange (legendary). You will come across greys through blues while leveling. Epics are very rare while leveling but do exist as rare world and boss drops. Epics are generally more common in end game from 20/40 person raids and PVP rewards. Legendaries (3 total) will only be earned by the elite.
---
From there, the question is how do you get the gear. While leveling, you get gear from various sources. Quests, mobs, dungeons, low level PvP, vendors, chests, and professions to name a few. In general, gear is a valuable commodity in vanilla/classic and upgrades actually feel like upgrades. Some gear from certain sources will not be useful to you. In the event it is BOE, you can trade or sell it. Do your best to research what stats and features are useful to your race and class and gear accordingly.
---
While at max level, gear will come mostly from bosses in dungeons and raids for PVE players and from vendors for PvP players based on your rank. However, early on, crafted gear from certain professions will be best in slot (perhaps to near end game). Some, if not most, of those items are BOP so you may want to have that profession if you’re desire is to have the best gear at certain phases of progression. Note that for PVE players, raiding takes TIME to get gear. It is not fast and groups/guilds typically have a system to award gear. PVP players also take time to get geared as ranks progress week by week and you are competing with other players for higher ranks. It is a brutal grind to rank 1 in PVP.
---
This may not be 100% accurate but it gives you a good overall understanding of how gear works in Classic!
---
You know ... they might have been ... and still with me on this one ... it's just a thought but ... I don't know, it could be that ... they were testing stuff?
---
I get that but that's not a logical solution. "can you give us dubbed servers? The government/film producers dubs our media content so we don't (remember?) English. 
---
Being anti social or having social anxiety shouldn't be an issue that Blizzard needs to fix. You can literally just type." Looking for German players to level/pvp/raid with, and if the Germans aren't hidden away on a special needs server, they will be all over the place. You know.... Since there are enough of them to populate entire servers. Because that's what they're saying right?
---
Set it to feathermoon stronghold in feralas once dire maul is out. Hearth there to farm dm north and port to wherever you need to go.
---
But the french and german commutiny exists in 2019 becous they have a choise, not becous they dont speak english, if they didnt have a choise; i bet you, one month into playing, you wouldt even notice the language change
---
That third video really brought me back.
---
Nah
---
No, because you instantly switched to personal attacks when someone challenged your opinion. That’s why you’re the asshole. Do you think attacking people is acceptable? What the hell is wrong with you?
---
I think it's going to be worse in classic. Judging by the euros servers announcements I think Blizzard will release as few servers as possible.
---
So the servers will be packed, all the big hardcore guilds will be on the same few servers and we will have massive PVP activity.
---
If I'm right I expect R14 will require something like 20+ hours a day. You will have to be in the "rank mafia" and wait for your turn and probably have to account share.
---
If they don't go the classic+ route, it might be way easier to rank after Naxx has been on farm for 6 months (in 2+ years) and a lot of people have quit because there's nothing else to do.
---
4% is a lot in wow terms.
---
Yes, stress test access but no email.
---
I played on many privates, pritty much everyone had 99,9% english trade chats all the time
---
I give this bait a 2 out of 10. Laid it on a little too thick and that's where you went wrong. My advice? Workshop this some more and come back in mid-August with some better delivery.
---
I propose 2 others:
---
Three days grace, animal I have become
---
Cross fade, No giving up
---
Now, let’s talk about the serious issue here: Shaggy... seriously?
---
ITT :How dare people  enjoy things I don’t deem particularly important 
---
Just let people do whatever they want with their lives , you are not their father or whatever
---
Classic has been out since pserver were around, it's not making a huge comeback its just making a legitimate one. First people wanted it how it was, so they put in synthetic spell batching, then leeway, people are crying about that now. Layering and sharding will be a big part of classic, doesn't matter if we like it or not, we're still going to play it. It won't be bustling like it used to when we were all learning together because we relied on each other, times have changed but there's no reason we still can't have fun. People are just over hyping this, and that does nothing good for the game
---
and my axe
---
Tradeable gear is not necessarily garbage, some items are BiS (best in slot) untill next raid/phase becomes available. PvE gear is a/are boss drop(s). 99.99% of them are BoP (bind on pickup) which means that once the item is looted from the boss it can't be traded with or sold to another player. And the PvP gear isn't necessarily the best for PvP. The stats on the items are more suited for PvP. They have more stamina (hp) then PvE gear, but less output/dps stats. Put two players of the same class with same skill level in a duel, one with the best PvE gear and one with the best PvP gear, the PvE geared player will most definitly win.
---
This is eu vs germany and france... Not eu vs the world bro
---
a valiant effort
---
Yes, I'm aware of this issue. It did seem to reduce as the druids went up in levels as well, so my hope is that the private server values are based on level 60 values from 10-59, but we will just have to wait and see.
---
europeans are actually pretty nice people, I'm sure it'll be fine
---
And some people are extremely deluded if they dismiss the possibility it's only going to last for the first day whilst Blizz gets on top of things. 
---
Truth is though, both are very unlikely.
---
Not sure that's abuse. It's been long known that a very high spirit total for warriors can make leveling faster than stacking strength.
---
They just need to boost their numbers for bfa to justify another expansion.
---
The UI is an extremely important part of any game.  If a UI is poorly designed, it detracts from players' enjoyment of the game.
---
Went all in with that post.
---
OKay its a hero class..
---
But how does it compare to its D&amp;D roots? I've always felt mage was way too focused on being elemental in wow (shoot ice or shoot fire). Wheres the lore? Wheres the Love?
---
The other guy is right. You're wrong. That's now how layering works.
---
Good fact ;)
---
I agree, once Naxx is done a lot of guilds will fizzle out. But some might just min/max for speed runs. So there's always that desire for perfect gear.
---
My thing with classic servers, they're stuck in an era. That way I can run alts through top tier content that I really couldn't do in vanilla retail. Highest I ran my alt through was BWL and world bosses. 
---
I'd like to run a couple classes at least, granted the second alt class is going to be ez breezy most likely if I'm running with the same guild.
---
But I'd also like it if they kept progressing servers with expansions. My ideal is to run TBC (IMO the best era) and WotLK (missed raiding here) which would be perfect. It would be nice if you could transfer characters, but Id hope there are fresh start only servers too.
---
I'd also like a run through cataclysm with a fresh start, no instant levels or transfered characters. Never did level a character though the new cataclysm impacted zones and it would be a nice change of pace.
---
Because if you roll on a DE realm as an English speaker, you wanna get the hell out of there. Roll on an FR server as a DE speaker? Tough shit, you gotta transfer out of there.
---
For the low low price of €20 you, too, can play the game you wanna play. Other than that I can't see why they can't just stick (DE) (FR) (ES) on ONE server, that's all people are asking for and it's not exactly fucking difficult.
---
Got a link for them saying it would be I'm affect in phase 2?
---
Hence why I've used my own custom ui since vanilla haha
---
I have absolutely no idea. But whenever I see Russians in my group I either kick them or leave.
---
Uh huh, the hype for classic has lasted for 15 years.
---
Two of those are the same thing lol. Maybe world pvp being an unbalanced mess for years and most rpg games now (even MMO's) havung fast travel is why those arguments seem dumb. 
---
When was the last time you played retail? None of you points are close to problems retail actually has. Like loot showers, lfr, poorer class design. I actually have learned to enjoy both and see probablems with both, but I really feel like these arguments stretch it lol.
---
Reminds me of this video https://youtu.be/XXNcTcf8TJg
---
WOTLK heroics were actually pretty tough back in 3.0, to the point where the final boss of Halls of Lightning had killed more players than any of the raid bosses (Naxx, EoE, OS) thus far.
---
But yeah, a plethora of nerfs + a plethora of catch-up gear made them a joke, and you could just aoe-faceroll through every single heroic.
---
I loved Cata launch heroics; challenging 5man content was awesome. My very first heroic at Cata's launch was Grim Batol, and I got into a group with 4 people from the same guild on another server, and we spent like 3 hours in there wiping away at bosses before finally clearing it. Good times.
---
It’s only in the game for one week after launch to make sure people can actually level
---
bgs will not be ingame till phase 3 sadly
---
I didn't know anyone watched towelliee. I thought people just showed up for the giveaways and he view botted.
---
Even if blizzard don’t do this it feels like the community could achieve this on their own by deciding what servers will be what
---
He said it was more fun in classic, not that he dislikes current wow.
---
 Playing Classic is still better than being a shitty Redit troll.
---
Single player but try dark souls 3 or bloodborne. It has that sense of accomplishment when you finally beat something you've said is impossible.
---
But you dont want that. Trust us. Lol
---
how are you confused? you perfectly explained why its different yourself. literally right there \^\^\^
---
The first issue is about language, regardless of location.
---
The second issue is about location, regardless of language.
---
Simple.
---
We have tons of flair and have for months. What are you talking about?
---
You’re insane if you think that vanilla warlock is easy.
---
Always loved the Tauren name Udderdoom =D
---
The votes have it.
---
Biggest downside will be leveling. Shaman has wolf, warrior has nothing.
---
How about no fucking layering at all? K thanks
---
This is what's keeping me from playing priest. If you stick to holy the rest of the game is just not as fun. Personally, I'm rolling warlock
---
Happened to a lot of people, plus the last stress test was open to anyone with a sub
---
Double that beyond my sight range in front and half of that behind me.
---
Each layer is the size of a full sized server. You'll return to the same layer each session. 
---
If anything you'll have the ability to form more connections since you'll be able to interact with people from other layers when forming dungeon groups via trade chat instead of organically out in the world.
---
Without layering you'd see the exact same people each session that you would without it.
---
Yes they do.
---
If I’m not mistaken, I had some macros changing the view / graphics to a higher degree then it was possible in the settings menu.
---
This was 7-8 years ago so it’s vague but i just wanted to mention that more utility then keybinds can be utilities from macros.
---
Fair enough, but its hard to appreciate how good things look when the UI keeps vomiting all over my screen.  Turned off glowing auras and tiny names, but now it keeps throwing noob pointers that take up 10-20% of the screen that I can't do anything about even if I turn off tutorials.  Might just be a trial account thing, but its still pretty hard to get around.
---
Fix? It's how it's supposed to be. #nochanges

Hey guys - received some messages for an updated link with the high resolution version, here it is:

---
Enjoy :)
---
1. Its not only about the trade chat.
---
2. Very very different playerbase on p-servers.
---
3. They knew it was an englisch server. Players who wanted german,french etc. p-servers played on those, so you have to count all those in.
---
Get out there and make world better place
---
So bad, so good
---
This point is far misunderstood than it should be. The fact that there are items you can use at 52 in a 60 raid and it’s BiS shows the difference in gearing and difficulty in obtaining said gear. They Fd up when they made gear replaceable and must be replaceable every tier. Vanilla was on point with gear. I could run a mix of mc bwl gear and even a couple blues (if they were the right ones) and run aq40. In release, if you aren’t full geared from the previous tier you can’t do the next content. But let’s be seeious, you just spam dungeons and lfr for their gimme drops to bring your I’ll up. VOA in wotlk was a good idea. LFR, went too far.
---
Ur right about most of what u said, however the threat generated from battleshout is the same even if they already had the buff to begin with, the threat generated remains the same.
---
no its not :D #NoChanges :D

I don't take it well when people when people twist what I said and misrepresent my argument like I'm some sort of Hitler. I don't need to be nice to people who are such blatant assholes towards me. What's wrong with me? I've been discussing shit on the Internet for 20 years and wasted tons of times on trolls maliciously trying to piss me off with shit like that, so I'm just not taking it.
---
If you're respectful with me, I'm respectful with you. If I say A AND give you quotes with explanations as to how I meant them (because I am aware that sometimes you just misunderstand things during conversations) and you STILL insist that I said B and that I'm a bad person for saying B regardless of me making it clear that I didn't and explaining to you what and how I meant it, then you are an asshole and I'm not going to sugercoat it. 
---
You do not have the prior claim on interpreting the text that I write. I do. If you think you know better what I mean by what I write than I do, you're a fucking lunatic.
---
He is saying that BfA was a disappointment too despite looking good visually
---
What noob pointers?
---
And frankly I agree with you that the stock ui sucks, its why I've ran my own custom ui since vanilla
---
Sounds like autofellatio.
---
Layering is the current "reeee" topic, so yeah just an easy way to get karma by whining about it.
---
“Nobody quit playing retail because they got to older and got married” you’re a moron if you actually think this
---
Layering *is* fine you muppet.
---
Supporting  #nochanges means precisely German and French only servers.
---
Yes!
---
I play FFXIV too, and yeah, layering is a very familiar system that's almost perfectly fine to me.  I'd even be fine with having no "cooldown" on changing layers.  However, it really should be even more like FFXIV's system.
---
For example, if someone on another layer invites you, you shouldn't be instantly moved to their layer no matter what.  You should have to go to a rested area and relog or exit the zone entirely and re-enter.  I think that would fix the issues people seem to be complaining about while still making it relatively easy enough for people to play with their friends.
---
After all, the only reason you can change layers by being invited to a group is to play with friends, even those you haven't made yet.  It doesn't seem unreasonable to me for friends to coordinate and plan on re-entering a zone or at least go to an inn.
---
I guess this ended up being what you said mostly.
---
This makes 0 sense
---
The layering babies can't read, they only exist to bitch and flood the forums with their garbage.
---
But do they overdub everything on Netflix too? What about Youtube and Twitch? Or do they just refuse to watch anything in English?
---
People making spirit sets for inbetween mob pulls is nothing new, neither is it an exploit.
---
I never said it was going to "make a huge comeback".
---
Stop putting words in my mouth and then writing up a paragraph arguing against them.
---
assuming [this](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Health_regeneration) is correct :
---
- he regens 65 Life per tick
---
- warriors regen life at a rate of: spirit *0.80 +6 per tick
---
- so he would need 73.75 spirit for 65 life regen ticks.
---
It's not about not speaking english, it's about being able to communicate with great details, using humor or anything.. so that people can make lot of friends and have more fun together !
---
The classic ui is generally regarded as trash and will be replaced by a lot of people very very quickly. Its subjective but there arent many players that dont modify their ui in some way. Doesnt make the game bad.
---
So you do agree its better than the current way it is, that’s important :)
---
They ARE two separate games. Modern WoW is endgame focused. All the difficulty is in Mythic +, RBGs, Arenas and Raiding. Endgame in Classic is almost an afterthought.
---
Okay. That only works if you're the only one doing it. You're still limited to the resources of each layer which will also house an entire server's worth of players.
---
If you believe you can run around in the world and have a monopoly on all the resources you need to sit down and think about this.
---
Even if it was possible and you had a monopoly it would still only be one player affected. Compare that to a world without layering where every single server is completely dead because the retail tourists have left, that affects every player in the game.

It's what worries people, the notable difference between few weeks and few months.

So Azuregos to Org is still possible?

i had like a dozen people in dun morogh. guess everybody went human and all the dwarves and gnomes got split up even further.  wonder how dead teldarassil was
---
What do you mean? That's how the system will work. But let me guess, you don't want to understand you just want to complain?
---
They did. This is the inverse of a comic that came out in Legion
---
This isn't about willingness, it's about how we remember wow classic. It worked just fine in retail from vanilla to bfa to have language-specific realms, so why change that? People on these realms are used to it and expect it. If it's different for you, that's fine, but nothing changes for you. You can just play on the English servers as before.

I'll answer your question with a simple counter question.
---
Question: As a company that operates internationally, is it smarter to accommodate to your potential clients so they can make money off of them, or not and lose the business?
---
Point: Blizzard is a company that indeed operates internationally and gains customers through accommodating to them. Every international company does this because it makes a lot of sense from a business point of view.
---
Nobody expects anybody to do anything. But everyone has a right to be disappointed by certain decisions and choose not to buy the product as a consequence. Or, they buy the product and do whatever they feel like with it (without breaking TOS) ... in this case speaking their own language on international servers. Without accommodating to their customers everyone looses in this case: Blizzard looses some subs, the players who want to speak their own language do not get to play the game they wanted to and the people who would be willing to play on an international server (and speak English) have to put up with people who will speak their language.
---
To sum up: The scenario in your question has absolutely nothing to do with the actual scenario of EU servers. And, while the point you are making is technically true, it is wrong when it comes to companies that operate internationally and want customers from different countries who speak different languages. Because if a company truly wants to do significant business in said countries they will have to accommodate to their clients. If they don't, way fewer people will buy the product.

You said ill be able to form more connections because ill be in different layers? But if layers didnt exist these people would be on my realm anyway?
---
And I never said you said that, you ironic little toaster. Get bent elsewhere if you can't be civil here.
---
It is true. In my country porn is in the top ten visited web sites. Don't trust the guy that tell you are a pervert because you look at porn to masturbate when needed. He is probably owning a whole collection of snuff movies in his computer.
---
Each layer will have the same cap of a full server. If there are queues that means that every single layer is full which in turn means that every layer has 3000 people online.
---
"I" "I" "I", well I have to tell you that I don't  care what your personal experience/ease with English is. We are talking about thousands of players here .. "I can do it so everyone should be able to do it" is a stupid argument
---
BfA vibes.
---
I didn't say it makes the game bad.  I said it detracts from players' enjoyment.  The fact that so many players modify their UI is evidence of that.
---
It's a running joke that he'll end up being a warrior with 9 heal bots in WSG.
---
As for me rolling druid? I'm gonna do it. I never played a druid during any of the old expansions, so I'm excited to give it a try in vanilla. Aaaannnndddd if it all goes to pot? I know how to power level a priest from 1-60 in classic in 2 weeks ;)
---
More like removed 5 classes. Nowadays we just have ranged dps, melee dps, healer and tank.
---
Might give it a go again. Tried on ps4 but a boss straight up did my head in using ps4 controller
---
That is normal now. You will think differently after few weeks when Classic will launch.
---
This was a thing in some expansion. Healers healing by throwing dots and their dps heals.
---
Ludicrous, though pretty fun for the healers. Just like how Mists of Pandaria's, er was it called vengeance mechanics, made it so tempting as a tank to just stand in Garrosh's AoE, take 1 million damage, survive at 1 hp because cloak, and then do twice as much dps as anyone else.
---
It really is not, especially in this context.
---
How are you gonna tell me what I remember from my childhood😂 I remember my third birthday party at chuck-e-cheese, I punched chucky cuz he was scary asf
---
Hand of ragnaros. A single raid can merit a single item, you are very spot on sir. There are so many ways to widen gear, and not just divide it in tiers
---
First off, I love how hurt you are. Most people in my guild who are also private server heroes don't want world buffs in the game too so I am well aware of being a minority. 
---
It's not an advantage if all you have to do is \*play the game\* an extra hour. It's not an advantage unless you intend on competing in raids and by the sounds of it you aren't really a hardcore player to be thinking of that anyway.
---
Just na/oce afaik
---
Cata had pretty hard dungeons, too. That was genuinely fun for me, someone who started at the very end of Wrath.
---
Of course the Cata heroics were nerfed, too.
---
Very high chance they don't play on European realms anyway or aren't affected by this at all. If someone from France or Germany wants to play on English realms they were able to do that in 2005 and when classic launches. They're not affected by this at all.
---
Hey man! I was the shaman in that run, Enrim. You were the rogue right? You did awesome :D
---
Agree with most except Nelf fem hunter...those flips...!!
---
Good description. A shorter version of it would be $. Why did they make the game easier and easier? $. Pissed off players quit games. As you mentioned, players with nothing to do quit games. So you simplify and streamline everhrbjnf to keep the maximum amount you can engaged with the game. Why? $. 
---
Now, taking it to a macro level. Why does anyone make any product or service, or go to work? $.
---
So to summarize: you make aggressive comments, get called out on it by not one but two people, and are now saying it’s us misinterpreting your “friendly” comments. Got it. But hey if you’re done with the conversation you’re done I guess.
---
Yes but they wouldn't be able to log in.
---
* Let's say there are 30k people on your server. 
---
* The cap of the number of simultaneous logged in players of a Classic server is 3k.
---
* Without layering you'll only be able to interact with 10% of the entire server population at any given time.
---
* Let's say each server can have 5 layers at most, then there will be 3000 x 5 players online instead, so 15k. You can now interact with 50% of the server however you'll only see 10% when you're out in the world.
---
Ah I meant about the windfury totem since it does not benefit shapeshifted forms. Grace of Air is better for druids 😁
---
60 levels is the difference you’re thinking about
---
Looks amazing.
---
&gt; You give each guild a random name if there are collisions
---
Who gets priority?
---
It's actually the opposite for me. Don't get me wrong, I think classic is the superior game for all the same reasons you listed, but simply because I have two versions of the game to choose from now, it made me appreciate retail a bit more.
---
What I mean is that, before classic, I would get frustrated with retail the same as everyone else. Levelling was boring, the sense of adventure was gone, and I just couldn't enjoy the game much anymore. But now that I know I'm going to have classic to play instead to fix all those problems, it made me focus on the newer things of retail instead. Mostly the fluidity of combat, the storytelling, music, great artwork/models, and newer classes like monk and dh.
---
I got an appreciation for these things knowing they won't be in classic. Now I still think classic is the far better game, but I suppose me knowing I'm going to take classic seriously allows me to play retail casually instead. Playing retail seriously is awful, but when you slow down and just enjoy for the experiences that ARE there, it suddenly doesn't feel so bad. So I'm going to be playing both, classic most of the time for serious and meaningful gameplay, and retail every now and then just for the story and immersion.
---
I realised most of my problems with WoW were due to the fact that we couldn't go back and play older versions, we were stuck with what blizzard gave us at the time. But now, that's not a problem. I'm not forced to play retail if I want to play wow, so it's easier for me to focus on the positives and actually enjoy my time if I do decide to play it.
---
This is shit ... The real problem is layering not language servers
---
 classic wow was made when levelling up made up 50% of the content,  now it's just blast to max level and min/max stats for that sweet e-peen.
---
my favourite gaming moments of all time across all games mostly come from the levelling times of classic wow.  that one time my level 12 lock killed a skull level warrior (around 40). just great times.  now I hear you can just create a character at max level in retail?? what's the point?
---
Yes, since not everyone knows english the germans that don't will naturally speak german and won't be able to communicate with the rest of the population.
---
Holy nova was literaly the worst and biggest mana sink in game. Mainly used only to pop rogues out of stealth with rank1
---
Why is the cap so small then
---
There are no PvP rewards and there are no honor system. Everyone will focus on PvE content in order to prepare for when the PvP systems are enabled in phase 2.
---
This is basic stuff.
---
&gt; When was the last time you played retail?
---
My last sub window was roughly between July/August 2018 up until about the first month of BfA. Locking flying for the start of the expansion was a good move because it lets them do some things that are just impossible with flying. It goes to show how hard flying it makes to create good content for them and how they forcefully need to remove it at least temporarily to create a better leveling/early expansion experience.
---
It's funny how you can see all these problems that flying creates and the measurements that Blizz takes to try and contain them, yet fail to draw the connection between the problems and flying.
---
Blizzard knows flying is shit. They tried to remove it but being scared of the community backlash, who have gotten used to the convenience, have chosen to at least contain it by restricting it to the end of the expansion. The classic community AND even the WoW devs know that it's shit for the game.
---
And mods should delete those comments (if against the rules) and not lock down and entire thread.
---
unintended uses of things in vanilla is a big reason why people STAY with the game
---
the world is not so black and white. there are ways to prevent this like locking an entire account to one layer so you dont magically float through space and time every 20seconds to mine another arcane crystal for 40g when the server launches.
---
You dont need a monopoly, you only need to sit down and consistenly log in and out and you get a cut big enough to let you settle for the rest of the server cycle.
---
the other day there was a screenshot of some random pleb farming 7 arena master chests within 20minutes of stress testing by hopping layers.
---
this trinket went for thousands of gold as it was incredibly difficult to secure one and some random guy manages to circumvent paying 1500g+ by logging in for 20minutes. thats quite the gold per hour.
---
&gt; The moment I knew I would never see retail WoW the same was after queuing up for RFC in classic.  
---
Does classic have a dungeon finder?
---
How can you make all of these observations by leveling from 1-15 in 48 hours?
---
Couldnt we make a addon that filters foreign language in channels. This would solve the spam but we still end up in groups where u possibly cant communicate properly, which made vanilla WoW so good
---
Healing and tanking is way more interesting than in retail. Mana management, crowd control are just a few things that make it more interesting as well. 
---
Plus you have to work for your rewards... No instant gratification like in retail... Meaningful work and meaningful relationships... That's the biggest difference between vanilla and current retail.
---
NE Druids also have the wrong lvl 1 mana pools on all the pservers I've seen. They have 67 mana on ND but had 100 on the stress test. After lvl 2, they all line up.
---
And people who want to play 15 year old game online aren't niche ?   
---
Give me a break. Yes there will be bunch of people who can't speak english but it doesnt matter - they will play in their language guilds and not communicate all that much with others. You don't need to know english to be able to do "WTS Linen Cloth 1G" "COD?" "YES"
---
The problem is that modern high school and university language courses don't prepare you for the vocabulary you'll need for World of Warcraft.
---
I can speak enough French &amp; German to ask where the bathroom is, for example, but not to ask where the warchief is.
---
No unfortunately not. Spell hit is intrinsic to all spells and depends on the level difference between you and the mob, or an enemy and you. 
---
Resistance has two factors; the level difference between you and the target and the resistance on that target vs the spell penetration you have. Similarly to the 1% miss chance you can't get rid off, targets have a level based resistance value that can't be reduced in any way. There are a lot of theories on how exactly this works, but essentially it's something like 5 or 8 resistance per level difference. 
---
Another thing about hit and resistance, some talents say "Reduces the chance for enemies to resist your x spells by y%." This just means hit, it has nothing to do with resistances or spell penetration. So talents like Suppression for warlocks give you +hit with your affliction spells (not shadowbolt unfortunately), Shadow Focus for priests give you +hit with all shadow spells and Elemental Precision for mages give them +hit with fire and frost spells (overpowered btw) while Arcane Subtlety for mages reduces the target's resistances, which essentially is spell penetration.
---
They will combine all the layers into one server in phase 2. So you’ll end up with the same people on the same server eventually. But yes in phase 1 everyone will be scattered all over the different layers.
---
English will be the primary language and people will be told off if they sway from it in general chat.
---
However certain servers will likely become unofficial language servers where none of it matters.
---
I actually made the mistake of believing someone when they said this to me in vanilla. I leveled as wand spec spirit tap and primarily disc talents. Second time I leveled a priest? I went full shadow and honestly the difference is night and day.
---
Due to the hit talents you gain the ability to slaughter mobs easily 5-7 levels above you as a shadow priest and it puts you absolutely leagues ahead in terms of questing efficiency.
---
Anyone that says shadow "just goes oom", spirit tap with a load of whale/owl greens will regen your entire mana bar from zero in a matter of seconds. Even if it didn't? I would still say go shadow, buy water, use your spells to kill mobs. You won't always have a top of the line wand for DPS, and investing some gold into water isn't the end of the world if takes literal hours off the time spent killing mobs.
---
 They won't but people will ne swamping around like crazy.
---
Now imagine that with 3 minute respawns on all mobs... no thanks.
---
Yoy will be honored with your faction by level 20 if you quest in the proper starting zone.  Aoe farming doesn't become WAY better than normal grinding/questing until your mid 20s so you should be fine if all you care about is the discount .
---
On Moonguard this is true
---
&gt; you make aggressive comments
---
I rant about something
---
&gt;get called out on it by not one but two people
---
I get my rant misrepresented as some form of evidence for an allegedly terrible character that I have - even through me explaining the rant and what it means - because you know better what I mean than I do.
---
You continuously harass me for the same shit that I have numerous times explained is not as you represent it to be. I don't know what your problem is or why you're so hell bent on proving that you know better what my posts mean than I - the author - do, but this is my last reply to you. I'm blocking you know because clearly this is going nowhere and you're incapable of accepting that you're just wrong in assuming that you know me better than I do.
---
Stick your arrogance up your ass.
---
That’s insane.
---
Everyone is being all nice in here....I'm probably gonna be the one who steals nodes from people in combat &gt;.&gt;
---
Because that's what the game was designed around. They wanted that small town feeling where people recognize each other and settled on 3k. They actually wanted even smaller caps initially.
---
Everything in the game is designed with that cap in mind. Mob density, mob respawn timers, number of gathering nodes and respawn timers on those and so on. 
---
And since the community have been aggressively pushing for no changes and the developers seem to agree with that stance they're not changing the game. Layering is a way to get around that, you can put more people on each server for a while without changing the entire game. 
---
Later when the hype dies down and the millions of BfA players get bored and leave they can remove the layers and each server will still have a healthy population.
---
It's one of the strongest AoE spells in the game and allows the priest to solo farm DM E.
---
It's still a thing for Disc priests, and other MMOs are pushing healers to DPS more, now. You won't have enough DPS to kill endgame raid bosses in FFXIV if your healers aren't DPSing.
---
Layering is literally so they don't have to have to do everything you are saying. Having more servers and then merging them is pretty well understood to be a much shittier solution. Most decisions have cons, thats life. Layering does too. The pros outweigh them pretty heavily, and the most frantic posts I have seen about it are from people who seem pretty misinformed.
---
It's because they don't care , since LH will close in 2 months.
---
It actually doesn't work shit in LH...everyone is ignoring everyone else. You are confusing indifference with "it works".
---
The first argument of the post shows that OP does not understand why blizzard is implementing layering in the first place. The goal of layering is to be able to manage plenty of Players in the same zone and This will happen ONLY at launch. Even if the flow of players is multiplied by 10 progressively, it’s Not an issue. You will be able to do your quest and pex properly as most of the people are going to be out of this zone. The launch is the only issue.
---
People wanted authentic vanilla spell batching. And not this bugged monstrosity where it feels like you’re playing with 500ms.
---
Some were difficult and others were easy. The Nexus was a dungeon that I remember just running through without any problems at the start of the expansion. 
---
But sure, you could die in wotlk heroics. They weren't braindead from the start. Still their difficulty was way lower than BC heroics. Those were brutal at the start of the expansion. Cata was somewhere in between.
---
Yeah I've thought about this for a long time and the more questions I ask, the more I push myself to play mage rather than priest.
---
yea it can last months, it can last years, classic might be cancelled before phase 2, etc. etc.   
---
we can't really argue against hypotheticals because you're not wrong, but it's speculation and nothing else. if you just want to raise your concern then sure, everyone is concerned. doesn't really help
---
I’m in favor of language specific servers because it will be provide non-English speakers a place to meet other people who are in their position. While a good part of Europe learns English not all of them want to have to communicate using a secondary language.
---
I have tried to learn other languages over the years and it can be hard. I wouldn’t want players to feel alienated, just because of a language barrier.
---
I respect your comment as well as your point of view. 
---
My post had nothing to do with corporations and their thought process or buisness model, intentionally. 
---
But since you brought it up.
---
It goes without saying to me that yes Blizzard markets their product world wide is a company with investors and they care about money. However they are free to do whatever they want however they want to regardless of what you or I think. 
---
So to clear it up, I’m plainly stating my opinion and how I view what some people are complaining about. I think that the complaint of Blizzard not providing a minority of certain people with what they want along with saying that only English is to be used in public chat is well within their right.  I feel like the majority of people just have their feelings hurt because they are not getting what they feel like their owed.
---
I apologize if my reply is a bit out of sorts I’m currently at work and having to multi task. Good day to you.
---
Because there's a ton of tryhards these days who know exactly how every detail of this game works and will be going at 95% efficiency from minute 1 till 60. This is going to help all throughout the initial launch of classic in all areas. 
---
They also have to worry about how many people are going to join, they simply have nothing to use for reference. Account for too few and servers are overloaded, account for too many servers are dead and they've wasted money. This isn't as cut and dry as Reddit would like to believe.
---
I tend to be my gf's healbot whenever she plays with me.
---
To be fair, for years and years retail players shit all over vanilla players. Remember the "wall of no"? I'm pretty sure we've earned this. Also, classic &gt; retail is absolutely more true than retail &gt; classic.
---
&gt; You dont need a monopoly, you only need to sit down and consistenly log in and out and you get a cut big enough to let you settle for the rest of the server cycle.
---
&gt; the other day there was a screenshot of some random pleb farming 7 arena master chests within 20minutes of stress testing by hopping layers.
---
&gt; this trinket went for thousands of gold as it was incredibly difficult to secure one and some random guy manages to circumvent paying 1500g+ by logging in for 20minutes. thats quite the gold per hour for a level 4.
---
Yes and those are obviously bugs with the system and should be reported so they can be fixed. 
---
You and your guild are supposed to get stickied to "your" layer and you shouldn't be able to switch layers unless you're in the same zone as the player who's inviting you.

Yea it's before it get bottle fed to noobs. Proper wow
---
Good. Welcome aboard the aware boat brother!

Hit the group with a "Kinda new to tanking, be patient please." at the start and you are good.
---
Yeah you’re right, anyone in na / oce with a sub, no email sent
---
Would you provide a filthy basement for mods who can't afford their own underground junk food den?
---
Eh, I don't use it that often, mostly reserved for when a caster takes some light damage and they don't really need that much healing
---
So it occurred to me that from my experience playing vanilla I don't remember the huge leeway, but it is hard to say what is correct with lag, private server bad info, and 15 years of memory decay, but I do remember certain situations where players seemingly had superhuman reach.  That would be when a rogue was sprinting or when a warrior was midcharge, their ability to make contact seemed intentionally broken in vanilla.  
---
So with this video it is clear that leeway is not constant, that it should change on the relative speed difference between the targets, since some slows change leeway, but that it has to be bugged since some slows are changing leeway and others do not.  
---
That makes me wonder if the probably too simple solution is that there is a bug that is making the leeway calculation double the speed difference between players so that anytime both are running the game is rewarding the leeway to the player as if they were sprinting.
---
Hello sir, what does M stand for in MMORPG?
---
Glad you joined the team bro, welcome
---
No, there's only room for one obese lonely nerd in my ~~mum's~~ basement.
---
Guilds will usually take one shadowpriest into raids, so there are competition for spots. You also have to consider what raids you are doing. If it's only MC then really you should be able to heal that as shadow. That raid is completely doable in green gear as long as the tank has decent gear. If the tank has shit gear then an army of T3 priests won't keep him alive. We have one shadowpriest currently but two of our healing priests will spec shadow for pvp and heal in raids. You just gotta find a good guild, but it might be too late for that.
---
Their reasoning is completely irrelevant. It was not changed during the lifespan of Vanilla and so it shouldn't be back-ported to Classic.
---
I second this.
---
The path of the least resistance. This is what people DO.
---
People will rather take over a realm, instead learning a foreign language.
---
Since they will do it...why the fuck NOT giving them official language realms in the first place?
---
Nice.
---
I like you, I just wanted you to know that.
---
Right, they can make assumptions about ratios, when it comes to regions. But there is not current statistic they can use to credibly predict the overall demand for classic.
---
I did a very quick analysis from two different sources yesterday for the ratio of German players. It is somewhere between 16% and 21% ... I'd assume that France is at the very least at around 10%. So, depending on the estimate for overall (mid to long term) demand it is quite clear whether or not regional servers are a good idea. Let's take a very conservative estimate of 100k players in all of Europe for a longer period. That leaves France with something around 10k+ and Germany around 16k+. Both numbers are large enough to have at least two decently populated servers.
---
Nice
---
It's clearly a bug, the error message "There are no fish in here" appears throughout all of Ironforge. However, when clipping the edge of the pool at some angles, it is possible to fish into a wall that has no fully removed its fish!
---
Going to sleep/outside few hours then come back and it's gonna be OK to progress :)
---
If they don't enable dynamic respawn that will make players not creating groups, it's "ok".
---
No, I played them at launch. We were farming them to level the guild up. We entered them undergeared and still pulled through with no problems, when we had a bit of gear from them it turned into faceroll.
---
&gt;How it was possible to start with such a great game, and end up here like this?
---
Small changes. Each one could be argued for or against on its own merits, like its *convenient* to be able to use meeting stones to summon party members; who could object to that change? But it takes a little something away from warlocks. A portal room in shattrath? Awesome! Except, it takes something away from mages. A buff to ret paladin dps? Nice for paladins, but then when you can get outdps'd by a paladin, whats the point of playing rogue in pve? They do the same damage but also bring extra heals, buffs, bubbles etc.
---
Small changes, over time. They need to ask themselves when we're post-naxx and looking to expand whether they want to make the same changes they did thirteen years ago or go in a different direction this time.
---
But that's my point: your english was not good and neither is the level of the random kid/teenager in europe outside of a few countries so let's not pretend the level of 10 yo in europe is good enough to have more communication than 'don't stand in the fire stupid'
---
And I just remind you that server in German and French were there from the start in Vanilla so it's not really wanting 'more and more and more'
---
But I hope you won't complain if you happen to be on the unofficial german or spanish server and you'll take that opportunity to learn a new language.
---
You’re a fool.
---
Atm it’s not really viable. With spell batching + leeway it’s extremely difficult to kite packs of mobs. It’s nothing like it was back in Vanilla.

It does so automatically on mobile, and it’s not something I regularly thing about.

You want to talk about what some mod did to make you so cynical?
---
Most players are just bad.
---
3 weeks is plenty of time for abuse
---
He regens 39-40 life without his spirit gear and 65 with his spirit gear
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Health_regeneration
---
Assuming [this] is correct, warriors regen at
---
&gt; spirit * 0.8 +6 
---
life per tick
---
Now lets apply this to the footage:
---
With Spirit gear he gains 65 Life per tick
---
Amount of Spirit on his gear:
---
- 5 Boots
---
- 7 shoulder
---
- 4 belt
---
- 3 wrist
---
- 7 hand
---
- 2 leg
---
- 9 chest
---
=&gt; total of 37
---
His dps equip has 4 so the difference is 37-5 = 32.
---
Now we only need to calculate the regen the additional spirit gives:
---
- 32*0.80 = 25.6
---
- 65 (with spirit gear) - 40(without) = 25. 
---
So yeah as others said, not an abuse.  
---
I recommend that next time you make it sound less...idk... offensive/accusive.
---
 It is a great tip players that dont know as much about the intricacies of the game, but the title kind of reads like the warrior is abusing a bug.
---
I felt the same way. Still ended up giving it a shot. I realized that I had forgotten a TON about the game. Being able to play now is actually prepping me for when the game goes live in two months. Watching streamers (the ones that are leveling) on twitch helps.
---
Weapon skill is unnecessary but yeah classic is better
---
That's absolutely ridiculous.
---
It's worth keeping in mind that over time the devs painted themselves into a corner. Once the player base was accustomed to convenience the devs would have been reviled and players would have left in droves anyway. 
---
It wouldn't surprise me if the classic reset was a clear eyed attempt at not just making rose colored glasses, but resetting those fundamental dynamics to the last time they contributed to a robust community.

I played a Resto Shaman in BC. IIRC, I made macros to make all my healing spells cast on mouseover. So, whichever Ally I was hovering my mouse over was who I would cast the spell on. 
---
Something like
---
/cast [mouseover] Chain Heal
---
For example. Made it a lot easier to heal a lot of different targets quicker.  
---
I also had a macro that announced when I used Mana Tide Totem. 
---
/cast Mana Tide Totem

/p Whimmy Wham Wham Wazzle! It's Mana Tide time!

I'm sure better Shaman can point out some better ones.

It's not gonna be possible to play with keyboard and mouse I'd reckon but go ahead and try.

Talking about a serious issue so that Blizzard can see that people are not pleased with their decision.
---
DC COMICS
---
lol did you seriously just compared learning boss mechanics with learning a new language? Are you aware that people take years to learn a language to a basic level and it can take decades to become fluent enough to be comfortable using that language?
---
Yawn. Go on a private server, with the add ons in place (and they’ll be in Classic), many players from European countries can’t even see what you’re typing in general chat, let alone join you in a group. This lowers the amount of people in your  layer who can actively join your for elite quests, making the world feel smaller.
---
Believe it or not some of these quests require coordination, when group members can’t speak the same language this only makes it harder and ensures frustration for a lot of people.
---
I’m sure the typical parade will label this opinion as “toxic” but those people likely have no evidence aside from old vanilla memories. Go onto any private server and tell me how you go trying to group up with players who don’t speak English. Sure, there will be that one great story of that one awesome guy who you managed to communicate with through emotes but that is the exception, not the rule.
---
Empyrian demolisher is a mace that drops off kazzak and has a chance to increase attack speed my friend had it on a private server and it procced quite alot so really good for furys and hemo rogues
---
No they dont however that wouldnt matter because whats going on is they are swapping to another layer where the node is already spawned.
---
If this is a #NoChange for you then you had some issues in your game experience.
---
Streamers will also ruin the game for non streamers because they will have a horde of followers that will give them whatever they need as well as grief people in areas that streamers need to quest and just generally ruin the economy.  Who do you think will get the aq event, asmongold or any non streamers on his serverm
---
I can 20 man raid on retail with 1mb. You'll be fine
---
With proper addons you will be able to swap between the 2 sets with the press of a button. You won't really be vulnerable in pvp except from stealth as you would see anyone else coming in advance and be able to put on the dps set instantly.
---
That's what we've been saying all along. It's great to see you write this. Cheers
---
If you just want to play vanilla then just go on a private server and muck about a bit before launch. You can also go backwards. There's an Everquest private server (which is legal even) called Project 1999 and that's definitely a completely new experience. 
---
Also Diablo 2, Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights.
---
I wonder how many people thought that and resubbed.
---
A big thing that was lost from WoW for me was all the RPG elements, more specificly the loss of mechanical expression. There is no design intended rotation in classic, just a bunch of tools to solve different problems. Hybrid play was a form of player expression, but it was seen as sub optimal and to be removed. 
---
Blizzards design philosophy is akin to a over bearing mother, sanding away any sharp jagged edges, building the class identity for you because you can't be trusted to build effectively. 
---
One of my favorite memories was farming my bow skill on my warrior, as I just felt like I wanted to make my warrior the best sharp shooter in the realm. I was then fighting a rouge in battlegrounds and got him down to a sliver of health. I got rooted by an enemy druid while the rouge made his escape. This is what I was training for, this was my chance. I click that shoot button and watch the arrow trail towards him in anticipation. Direct hit and down for the count, all my training paid off and it felt amazing. 
---
Today I cannot express my idea of a warrior or a shaman, I have to play THEIR version of a warrior or shaman. No longer can I be the warrior who has mastered his toolkit, a true master of arms, or a shaman who is not afraid to take the threat for the team with a shield and his trusty totems at his feet, I have to play their finely tuned and optimized versions, their idea of what my class should be. 
---
A huge fantasy world where I cannot express myself is not a world I want to be part of.
---
BRING BACK THE WHITE ETHNOSERVER
---
Because manually manipulating the layers for the sake of stressing out the server (what is shown in the clip) is not an example of what will happen at launch.
---
There isn't one. Everyone speaks English.
---
I haven't waited two years for Classic just to sleep during the launch. I want to actually play the game, not just sit in queues or standing around trying to tag mobs in a sea of people.
---
Yeah, same here.
---
I'll probably just log into retail and sell whatever I have left in my 5 guild banks.
---
How am I supposed to queue from work? I dont have wow on my work comp
---
&gt; I know it could be an unpopular opinion, but do you think it's because all the people that play retail had the opportunity to play the stress test this time? I know when I attempted to play retail while I was waiting to see if I got into the beta I had the same experience. 
---
I don't think that's an unpopular opinion at all, in fact it's probably exactly what happened. 
---
Current WoW players have been taught to behave a certain way due to the systems of the modern game. A couple of hours of vanilla isn't going to "cure" that, a lot of them probably don't want to get cured and will leave once they realize what kind of a game Classic is.
---
This is the exact reason why we need layering, the flood and subsequent ebb of the retail players would leave every single server barren without it.
---
I hope that if you happen to be on the unofficial german server, you'll see this as an opportunity to learn a new language and won't complain to see "Wer hat den Schlüssel für obere schwarzfelsspitze?"
---
Afaik can't post without sub, so can't really help :(
---
The entire server.
---
So layer for the first few weeks and then get rid of it once the population spreads out.  I'd rather be able to log in and actually get quests done then having to wait hours and then once I'm in have to compete with 500 other players for the same quest mobs
---
Alright then. Let's flip it around, show me footage from 2004-2006 that proves that it's incorrect.
---
It hasn't for me.
---
The core gameplay in retail is still leagues above classic. You can actually play specs according to their flavor. Vanilla is gutted by comparison, changing talent specs doesn't actually change that much about how your class plays, comparably. Respeccing in retail changes how your class plays massively, and the reworked talents can actually give you some choice, instead of the illusion of choice like in vanilla. Thankfully we have some \#changes to fix that from the beginning.
---
WoD, though lacking content, was perfect for someone who wants to log in, raid mythic, log off. None of this titanforging, legendaries and other such nonsense.
---
One could say that you are in *deep* trouble!
---
What? Who? Dafuq? What kind of weird machine genius have you meet ta can speak 24 languages? Only 38% of Europeans that don't have english as native language can speak english.
---
Right... cus that works. 
---
No it doesn’t work btw.
---
Oh no, we plan on rolling up some Horde alts to relive our glory days as Tauren Warr/Troll Sham. I'd be the WF bot, he'd be the benefactor :P
---
Dude is this a satire post? You attack me after I call you out for attacking someone else. Take a deep breath. You’re toxic af.
---
&gt; I get that but that's not a logical solution.
---
I honestly don’t think that you do get it.
---
&gt; Being anti social or having social anxiety shouldn't be an issue that Blizzard needs to fix. 
---
This change – and it is a change since French and German servers were a thing on EU launch of the game – is clearly hindering the social experience and not encouraging anti-social behaviour for anyone that isn't confident enough in their ability to speak English.
---
&gt; You can literally just type."Looking for German players to level/pvp/raid with, and if the Germans aren't hidden away on a special needs server, they will be all over the place. You know.... Since there are enough of them to populate entire servers. Because that's what they're saying right?
---
But exactly that is why this whole situation affects everyone. 
---
Most of them won’t be “all over the place” - the communities that previously had their own servers will try to form on unofficial servers for their language. Everyone that is not clued in to that situation will be out of luck should they unknowingly roll on (for example) the French speaking server – the majority of players there simply won’t communicate in English. 
---
&gt; Tl;dr. It's not our fault that they're being stubborn and refuse to integrate with the world.
---
The fact that there were people out there suggesting that the EU should change its official language to German or French after Brexit, should give you a hint that the situation clearly isn’t as cut and dry as you make it out to be. 
---
Many people simply lack the skills and given the reason I mentioned earlier in combination with the fact [that English is only #4 on the list of natively spoken tongues in Europe](https://www.babbel.com/en/magazine/most-spoken-languages-europe/), it’s hardly surprising.
---
&gt; Seriously. To assume that the game should cater to them in 2019 is weird to me. 
---
I’d agree if it wasn’t for the fact that these communities had server options for their native languages for over a decade now. Seeing as the social aspect in Classic is very important and the whole thing is a recreation of the WoW we were used to, I think their complaints are valid.
---
&gt; And people are arguing with me in English about it
---
I’m not affected by this situation any more than any English-speaking person would be. I’m just arguing for those that can’t argue for themselves because of the language barrier. A novel concept, I know…
---
&gt; LUL
---
WeirdChamp
---
This is misleading. The PVP and PVE realms are actually really empty. There are like 20 L. 40 Horde players on Classic Beta PVE. On Alliance its like 3x more. These numbers are about tripled on the PVP server.
---
at least provide a [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) if you put a song in peoples head.
---
I was considering chosing a german server just to improve my german, but ofc no one will do that :P  
---
ive been reserching a bit, and ive found out that we could have a HUGE freaking problem with spanish xD wich there probably will be..
---
check wowclassicpopulation.com
---
Supposedly the Germans have already decided to all roll on one server, so I'll know which one to avoid. Also my guild is like half German and all of them hates the idea of playing on a "German" server, so I'm quite safe from that. I still think Blizzard should make an English-only policy for public channels like they had during early vanilla.
---
Lol
---
First Old school RuneScape ruined retail for me and Classic Wow did the exact same thing
---
I saw the stress test footage, that's massively multiplayer enough for me. Even there it was hard to tag mobs.
---
It's new in the beta.  Watch the video when she strafing backwards, she's doing a fast walk backwards instead of the old running sideways motion.  It's really weird looking and it's triggered by using the strafe keys and locking the camera looking back.
---
Rofl, one week? You are too naive...
---
Seal of wisdom and some melee to regain mana in WOTLK. Wonderful.
---
Apart they weren't exactly funny but I'll always chuckle when I see this screen: https://i.imgur.com/WcxRk4M.jpg
---
I also find it abusing game mechanics when a warrior has a tanking seat of gear and a dps set. Filthy cheater!
---
We have a server data center in Sydney for all other Blizzard games so I'll be extremely surprised if they dont have a few
---
It's a symbiotic relationship.
---
Not when you're saying it all fast and mumbly like they usually do. But to each their own.
---
It's also worth keeping in mind that vanilla era was also very grindy and exclusionary. The base game is very different and arguably better, but the time involved was much more severe. And by extension many players were excluded from experiencing end game content. 
---
Think about the original Naxxaramas raid. The gear required to even complete the attunement was steep. Needing 40 players. The raid encounter complexity itself. 
---
I'm not advocating for it. My guild in classic killed Kel'Thuzad, but that was by far the exception not the rule. 
---
However, think about all the time and money at blizzard which went into making that raid, and the tiny percentage of players who actually saw the inside of it let alone killed any bosses. 
---
Is that a good model? Likely not. 
---
I'm hoping blizzard gets those issues right this time around. 
---
Having 40 people in raids was hard logistically for almost every guild, but cool. Learning complicated encounters, again tough but cool. 
---
The flipside is capping the value most players get from the game with a high bar for gear, logistics, and time investment is still a problem.
---
It's sad because i would have to ask you too, to prove me that we were playing with the same latency as now.
---
Because this mechanics even if working as intented was here to compensate for our poor network. Which is not the case anymore. It's like saying that Classic should still support Windows 98 and XP to be #NoChange.
---
&gt;	Who gets priority? Random? Creation date? that’s the stupidest fucking idea I’ve ever heard. I just get to randomly lose my character name because you insisted Blizzard create more servers than they would ever need? Don’t be a fucking idiot.
---
Yikes, calm down.
---
That is how these issues are solved.
---
Just look at old characters you haven't played. They will have a random string to make your name avaliable to anyone else. The string kn wow looks kind of like "dhalphir12847" or something like that. And when you then logon you get a free character rename.
---
The same could be applied for guild names should there be a collision in naming.
---
&gt;	Yes it is. Merging servers is, and always has been, interpreted by the larger community as a sign of a dying game. Developers will avoid it at all costs.
---
Me not know what?
---
PR is what you make of it.
---
If you merge servers and make a proper announcement with the reason for the merge it will not be a sign of a dying game, unless the game is dying and players know it.
---
&gt;Only in the long term.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;	if layering is still here three months after launch, come back to this post and tell me what an idiot I am. Until then, shut up, because you genuinely have no idea how the entire MMO industry operates.
---
You  need to calm down and stop calling people names and act like you know everything. You only make your argument lose value.
---
Layering, sharding, etc, even short term, is bad for the game. If it has any of the issues that people have found on the beta, it will allow some people to massive abuse the system while it is active for making massive profits.
---
That will cause long term economic effects, even if it was a short term feature.
---
There is also the fact thst a lot of connections in an MMO are created early on. When players just start and look around for help while leveling and questing etc.
---
And then having the game split into n amount of layers and thus hiding people from each other will cause issues with this.
---
Damn now I can only hear her voice for Whitemane reading this comment. Good observation!
---
Realistically, this is something Blizzard has been running numbers on internally to deem viability, and it's not something that's going to give them great results.
---
Private realm data is and surveys are pretty great resources for checking viability. All data points available show a sharp drop off in players between before level 20, indicating a lot of people quit. With server populations being what Blizzard wants them to be, can multiple EU realms exist with multiple languages without becoming barren? Once you designate realms based off language, you effectively cut any potential growth points.
---
Meanwhile, with English realms you get basically the same thing you get on private servers: clusters of large guilds and unofficial server clusters. That has its own problems for both native speakers and people who speak English.
---
We need a creative fix for this. Like, I would think extending the sharding on specific EU realms designated as foreign language realms, with the shard being chosen by your default language and stricter shifting restrictions could allow for Blizzard to have a failsafe built in in case of server death. If populations get too dire on like, a Scandanavian language cluster you could always break the shard and shift them into, like, a Dutch shard for example. Theoretically you could merge realms seemlessly into a pan European server without the headache of realm transfers if things get too dire.
---
If projected numbers are too bad they could do fusion realms. If they don't think German language and French language servers will quite be populated enough they could have official German a d French servers. Native speakers could form communities and the commonality of English as a second language could help things cohesive.
---
Frankly, and God this would piss people off, an open beta specifically for users who play on current foreign language servers may benefit Blizzard for updates concrete data.
---
Even if they default to just no EU language support servers after running tests, I'd rather see them throw modern design fixes at the issue and try some fixes over just giving up and saying fuck it. I think it's a good gesture if you say 'were gonna try x, y, z with our current tech to try and give you a desirable outcome. Might not work, but we'll give it a shot anyways.'
---
If you don’t take wand spec while leveling idk what to even say. Literally every guide takes a mix of disc and holy focusing on mana efficiency up until at least 40 where you can go full shadow but then still go wand spec 41-45. There’s a reason nobody tells you to do this and you are not questing properly if you’re routinely fighting mobs 7 levels above you.
---
lol I wouldn’t call this an exploit
---
Thanks. Only because other people speak in other languages, I don’t need to be offended by everyone. This would make my whole life so much harder, no thanks.
---
I guess he refers to the total character recorded for that realm: [https://wowclassicpopulation.com/characters?realm=Classic%20Beta%20PvP](https://wowclassicpopulation.com/characters?realm=Classic%20Beta%20PvP)
---
What is? 10x Gurubashi Chests cuz of Layer Hopping, or cooldown on layer switch?
---
Spelling "rouge" is the real classic experience
---
Actually*
---
&gt; becous they have a choise, not becous they dont speak english
---
[Citation Needed]    
---
Quite a few people simply lack the ability to properly communicate in English. 
---
Given the social nature of Classic and the importance of community building this is a big issue.
---
&gt;i bet you, one month into playing, you wouldt even notice the language change
---
And I bet they would either not play at all or take over one server for their language – which would result in unhappy English-speaking folk because the community on that server wouldn’t communicate in English for the most part.
---
It’s not just 50g each week. You would be looking at 100g round trip, per week. 50g to get into holy and 50g to get back to shadow.
---
It’s definitely possible to farm 100g a week, but it’s a huge investment of time. Priests holy nova is great for running Dire Maul East. Lots of YouTube videos on this. Start researching now!
---
Making every class a multi-tool so there are very few unique specialities that only one class could perform really took away a lot from the game...
---
Leeway is making me nervous of playing any ranged class at all. 
---
I was so set on warlock for so long. Now I might have to roll a warrior, even though I wont like it as much, because it looks so hilariously unbalanced as is. 
---
Have they said anything about it at all?
---
Non-sequitur.
---
I think the game felt generally correct to me. 
---
Most players being invited right now are competent as well. You can’t say the same at all about real vanilla. 
---
I’m not that far along on the whole conspiracy thing.
---
Could also be that it's old news now and people are using the stress tests to test out leveling routes for launch. That's what I did anyways. I didn't get any whispers but if I did I would probably reply. I can see some people not bothering though because the characters will be deleted anyways.
---
How else can we make the idea both more convoluted and shittier without a reddit megathread tho?
---
I started playing WoW in Cataclysm, and seeing everything about Classic has really shown me I started halfway down the slide on a fun/excitement level.
---
I had 10 MBit fiber in 2004 as did most other people in my country. Maybe you lived somewhere with bad Internet and that's the difference?
---
This is false. On privet servers it's against the rules to not use english. In Classic you can use any language and I from my own experience I have been on realms where English was the minority language in chat and once when I played on an unofficial Italian server as a noob chat was made up of like 99% Italian.
---
Best thing to do is roll disc to level, you get 50% bonus damage on your wand, your dot is enough combined with fears to kill efficiently and stay alive.
---
The only thing why I it would have been cool to have a German server (Austrian here) is to relive the exact same experience back in 2005. 
---
But I played on Nostalrius and had the same fucking fun back in the day, only in English. So it’s not that bad as people claim it to be.
---
So true. I was on Antonidas. Great time before O switched to Horde on Arygos
---
Mmm I should have been more clear for people like you.  My point was that it’s all application of the same technology, none of which was in place during vanilla and all of which will adversely impact gameplay to the extent left in.  How’s that?
---
Trying to get some real meta tribalism going early.
---
Ballparking 30-50g/farming rate.  Most gold guides are about crazy aoe skip/jump runs that are nice but herb or fishing once the server is mature and raiding consumables are valuable is about 80% as strong gold/hr so it can be pretty class/spec agnostic. 
---
If you like healing in pve, why not heal in pvp? horde typically lacks healers and priests especially.  Disc is slightly better in pvp, and slightly worse in pve, but guilds are often happen to take disc priests since they add other utility to offset the slight healing loss like PI.
---
Wow yeah wtf... Where are the new ranged classes??
---
&gt; Just look at old characters you haven't played
---
Yeah. Characters not being played is a very different scenario chief. You're talking about taking names away from people actively still using them.
---
Maybe Mr Crowley?
---
Early STV or badlands as alliance dont have an inn.
---
Western Plaguelands and Ungoro miss one as well AFAIK.
---
==&gt; Not without its problems, but definitly an improvement to what we have now. 
---
I am still against layering as a whole, but that does not mean i am against a good change either.
---
A 12 to 24 hr cooldown is dumb. 
---
All they have to do is remove layering, add dynamic spawns in the first few zones and let the population spread out naturally.
---
Artificially limiting who you can play with is dumb and ruins one of this big pillars of classic wow.
---
OP's post history basically strokes off MonkeyNews content and seems to want to post things like this.

All you need to know is he posted Alexensual content.

Haha nice!

"Pictures" is a synonym for movies. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/picture#Noun

I think there will be oceanic servers. I would highly doubt we would get jewed like that. Far too many players.

All hail the era of CC!

This was a vanilla bug.  I got polyd right at the moment I lost a duel.  I appeared fine on my screen, but as a sheep on other players.  Including when I mounted.  On redueling the same mage every time he sheeped me nothing happened at all, so I was unstoppable.  Tried to abuse it by Qing a BG but the bug faded when I zoned.
---
Thanks, the other one made me angry
---
Whatever. They were still objectively *more* difficult than WotLK ones

Nights were darker, you can buy potions at the dark moon fair to change it back to darker nights currently in retail. So I imagine yes it will be darker as the potions won’t be necessary
---
Looks like southern fucking California. Get out people!
---
Would you be kind enough to add me to this list of PM'ing the printer's site.
---
i have never seen such divided game in my whole life. what should blizzard do in the end i wonder ? just stop retail and focus on classic ? i don’t know. what a cluster fuck
---
People also don’t understand that the IT infrastructure is completely different than when Vanilla was our. Blizzard used to host every server and DB, but they use the cloud for everything now.
---
Oceania is more that AU - if Indonesia and Malaysia join in, it more than both EU and US.
---
If we end up on the same server, we can do the grind together. :) I did it once in vanilla, as a human priest, and I’m doing it again!
---
Retail seems to be closer to Diablo now, just fast paced hack and slash gameplay
---
I'd say they are two completely different games. Legion had extremely fun and fast gameplay and rotations (while BFA has slow and boring gameplay), while it had no real RPG aspect. The opposite is true for Vanilla.
---
It's 2 months until launch still, I'm sure they'll have it sorted by then. Blizz does have a bad track record with timely fixes sometimes, but they've also shown they understand the importance of a full and authentic vanilla experience. They're not going to launch with a class whose core mechanic is broken, imo
---
Oh man. I remember this. I remember laughing my ass off with my middle school wow buddies.
---
It’s projection. 
---
This sub is populated with posts by the angriest of neck-beards. I like to think these are the players who have disgusting, patchy, multi-colored beards which leads to self-negativity, projection, and ultimately, a lack of patience. 
---
Things in game need to fixed. Everyone knows this. That’s the point of beta’s and stress tests. 
---
There are about 2 months (8 weeks) to fix things. 
---
Certain people need to learn how to focus on progress of solutions rather than dwelling on the problems.
---
First of all it isn't an exploit as others in comments have pointed out. 
---
Secondly, if it was an exploit isn't it good that the private server guys found out and decided to publish it on Twitch so that Blizzard fixes it?
---
Fortunately the ignore list becomes relevant again and I hope there’s an add on to auto block any 1-10 in trade.
---
So... The download option never appeared in my launcher... Where was it?
---
They never remember to use them anyway. Fuck em for making me use up a soul shard.
---
I 100% agree with op and this comment. I’m staying positive though. Classic gives me something to look forward too.
---
Bruh I am already popping pimples on my ass from the stress test.
---
Yeah, layering is going to go away "after player populations settle down", just like the toll on a bridge near me is going to go away "once the bridge is paid off".
---
Hahaha
---
It's still fun though.
---
NO. I'm not running back to Orgrimmar over and over while my friends trickle in from their day jobs.
---
There is an NA server that is completely Chinese for some reason.
---
exaggerations
---
I'm quite interested in classic. I've always quite liked a standard mmorpg. Not many of them left. I do still play retail and will probably keep doing that. The raids are quite fun and challenging. But everything else... Meh.
---
In my heart I'm a priest. But I liked to alt with a mage, shaman and death knight. All 4 I deem pretty much ruined. Mages and dks are stripped bare and boring. Shaman and priest are ok at best.
---
Priest, the class I have the most experience with are dull. And they are my favorite. The hard split between the specs is annoying. The small flavor skills are gone and the talent system is shit. Glyphs are basically non existent. And the professions are meh.
---
I'll keep playing retail I think, but can't wait to start making my mains history.
---
It will still look like this with layering :) 
---
Dynamic respawn is so much better.
---
Berlin rly rly rly doesnt stand for regular Germany du Spast
---
I am sorry if I came off as too harsh.
---
&gt; My post had nothing to do with corporations and their thought process or business model, intentionally. 
---
But this is exactly the context of the whole situation. It makes little sense to leave this very critical aspect out of the argument (intentionally or not) because it is about a business making a decision that affects their customers.
---
You see, I would not mind playing on an English server myself because I am proficient enough to do so. But I know that many of my countryman (and women) are not and will get way less enjoyment out of the game or just not play it at all. And I don't think that people complain because of hurt feelings but because they are disappointed about the decision. And we are not talking about minorities here, just look at the countries' sizes according to population:
---
* Germany: Largest country (not considering Russia) with ~83 mil
---
* France: Third largest country (Turkey being second) with ~67 mil
---
* UK: Fourth with ~66 mil
---
* Italy: Fifth ~60 mil
---
* Spain: Sixth ~46 mil
---
From a language POV German and French are spoken (at least natively) more than English in Europe, so why not make one of them the standard language? 
---
The point is: It is hard to talk about "minorities" in Europe when the biggest country itself makes up only about 13% of Europe's population (again, not including Russia)
---
While many non-native English speakers in Europe do speak English well enough, many others do not or are not comfortable enough to use it during a leisure time activity. Example: My parents understand English well enough to watch movies in English, but they will always much rather watch them in German because it is easier for them.
---
You have a good day, too and hopefully enjoy your work.
---
As an English teacher the incorrect use of “you’re” hurts here—but great meme and endearing MSpaint skills.  Upvoted my fellow horse brother.
---
While there are a lot of things you can do solo on vanilla, there are tons of things you have to group up for. You have to communicate to get things done. I guess they will realize that or leave. I agree, we need layering to not have dead servers a month after launch. They just need to fix the issues with them.
---
So what are you and your mates planing to do with that Antonio Banderas sex doll on 26th of august in your basement?
---
Weird flex!
---
Es kann doch nicht so schwer sein zu verstehen, dass wenn alle sich auf den kleinesten gemeinsamen Nenner einigen müssen (sprachlich), eine völlig rudimentäre Sprache gang und gebe wird. Diese sorgt nicht nur für Missverständnisse und Kommunikationsbarrieren sondern nimmt auch jenen den Spielspaß bzw. schließt jene völlig aus, die Schwierigkeiten mit der englischen Sprache haben!
---
And if you didnt understand it than get yourself a dictionary cause german is the most spoken language in the EU and the arrogance to expect everyone to speak your mother tongue is quite similar to the arrogance that is implied in my statement. :) 
---
And just to let you all know what I wrote I try to use my pidgeon english to translated it since i can't write nearly as eloquent English as I can write German:
---
Is it that hard to understand that, if everyone has to speak English ppl have to rely on the smallest common demoniator, which ends in broken English for everyone to speak in order to make sure everybody understands eachother. This will lead to numerous problems based on misunderstandings, which lowers the experience for those who lack English knowledge(such as myself) and maybe cast out those who can't speak English at all.
---
work to live. Live to work
---
So bite is really good but if you have claw it doesn't have a cool down so it can just spam claw where bite has a CD. I generally will only teach it Claw and not bite so it can spam claw harder.
---
I had so much fun too. I just wish their weren't so many dorks spamming horrible shit on the /1 chat all day. 
---
I ended up just finding a party and making a new chat window without the gen chat.
---
Sit down Peanut gallery
---
Yes you can, but again, I'm pointing out that e.g. on ascension, even when the vast majority of the NA playerbase is asleep and it's mostly EU players, a lot of whom are not native English speakers... you still dont see a sudden influx of non-English into the channels.
---
Also as has been pointed out, despite it being against the ToS, you still had servers where the dominant population was e.g. Russian which resulted in that being the main language spoken on chat even though it was against the ToS
---
&gt; On privat servers it's against the rules to not use english and the GMs moderate the chat and hand out warnings. 
---
I fucking wish... It was like that on Nost but GMs haven't been monitoring chats for years. It's all trash spam and empty messages from Chinamen.
---
Same.  Specifically rolled shaman in classic to be a totem plopper because I liked feeling like I had an essential part to play in things.  After they mashed everything together and shared all the abilities I sorta lost interest in playing the endgame at all. 
---
 Who cares what class you are at that point, 4 others have your abilities and all of them have basically reskinned attacks anyway.  Big nuke, small fast nuke, a dot or two, and CC. 
---
oh and THEY TOOK AWAY EYES OF THE BEAST.  UNFORGIVABLE.
---
I feel ya man I have played since December of 2004 and have played everything but MOP. Loneliness is the killer of the game imo I don’t play an MMO to just do solo content. I am still playing BFA in anticipation for the 28th and I will be home again. Phlux will return to azeroth a happy orc shaman.
---
I see why some people might get upset, but not that it doesn't work, it does work and people will get over it.
---
And honestly, I don't believe it will ever come to the need of having to merge in the first place. So It won't be an issue. This is just the very last option that they will employ if the need arises.
---
lol @ retail &amp; community in the same sentence.
---
Uh, stuff.
---
This is exactly why I don't like current FFXIV, and why when I went back to FFXI it was so much better. That game is basically modern WoW with a different skin.
---
Roleplay Realms my dude
---
Lol no
---
It's a pretty vanilla fetish
---
😂
---
I see me!
---
Could it b because the EU people were excluded? It's not a small number.
---
but what happens if the big servers still hold 10k players?
---
For all the druids out there:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EPrW9rC3vA
---
I do hope its possible to all content when only raiding 3 days/week
---
If you run into someone shit, just /ignore and move on.
---
Yeah! Get him! 
---
Also how do you get flairs?
---
Did you read what I did?
---
I like this because it almost has an RP perspective.  Meeting up at a local inn before going out adventuring.
---
Maybe make it an inn *or* entering an instanced dungeon puts everyone on the same layer.  So if you find a group and dungeon, everybody can enter on separate layers but leave on the same one to continue together as a group.
---
Agreed.  This should have been done in the starter zones and that would solve the issue and be much more palatable.
---
Just to see where Im at gold wise for a token. But no Im lvl 110 will stay wherever I parked him
---
So you admit your likely shitting on a child who doesn't speak English well, Lmao.
---
And you think pointing this out does anything but make you look like a toxic gamer stereotype? 
---
Whoops
---
&gt; Just how are they going to merge layers, when layers by definition are in-realm instances of 3.5k people(Vanilla pop cap)? 
---
Because by the time they start merging layers they won't have 3.5k people in each one. 
---
A lot of people are going to quit Classic after the first couple of months. Like a lot. 
---
There were a lot of issues with Classic and the game itself up until around Wrath. That vast majority o players (before Cata came out) ***quit playing*** after hitting level 10. 
---
Blizzard expects the same with this game. They also expect that player interest and time in the game is going to drop off as time goes on as well. You have to have a lot of time to play Classic since the quests and leveling process are time consuming by design.
---
Ouch! Which one do you take issue with?
---
The American Revolution , WW1 or WW2? Please don’t say 9/11.
---
Just trying to figure out where the ill will is coming from.
---
A lot of popular specs will respec at 40 or 44
---
They've not said as far as I know, but I imagine a significant part of it is that if you have an official German language server, you also have to provide German language GMs and customer support. And since they seem very uncertain as to what the long term population is going to be, or how steep the drop off is going to be, they are perhaps wary of the risk of over -recruiting language specific staff. 
---
Particularly since they will be staff in Europe where employment law makes it harder to easily get rid of the excess staff if population numbers fall fast.
---
During early Vanilla there was German and French servers though.
---
And will you avoid the second german one if the first one is full and the french, spanish and italian ones? 
---
And if it's something that you'll be very careful about because you don't want at all to be on these kind of servers, doesn't this mean that it would be better for you and everyone if they were officials?
---
One of the original dev's confirmed dynamic respawns were part of release, so it's not like it's way off base. Even if they had to adjust it.
---
This is really just personal opinion. I tried retail a while back. Had not played since WoTLK and I thought the characters (specifically Dwarf and Gnome) looked so stupid I couldn't play them. 
---
Again, my opinion but the new models to me are atrocious.
---
Layers divide the player base, which could mean you’re on a layer where you’re not seeing a large number of players around you. That is a problem.
---
Months*
---
Didnt they already say layering will be temporary, essentially just using it to mitigate launch problems? 
---
I don’t think it should be a huge problem.  Maybe there’ll be some diehards who get gathering professions that high before layering is remove but kudos to them at that point
---
Equating layering with the game mechanics you listed is asinine.
---
&gt; do them and then you can have fun
---
This summarizes the issue with retail perfectly.
---
Complaining doesn't help anyone here.
---
Blackmoore &lt;3
---
Black desert online! A ton of fun for the first few months then gets super Grindy but it’ll definitely keep you interested until classic comes out there is a ton to learn in the game and a lot to do
---
I keep bringing up questions about the cities and world buffs and people keep shouting me down saying Layering isn’t going to be in the cities.
---
And yet...it is on the beta?
---
Then they can look at dynamic spawn times for rares or rares will be more rare. Not sure what would be preferable to the community, but you can't exactly go around telling people what server to play on based on a problem that may or may not exist. Cross a bridge when you get to it I suppose
---
Looks like a dungeon to me. With statues and brambles.
---
It does, you just need to block all 600 of his highlights channels
---
That problem is two fold. 
---
It feels bad when there's a "secret" to playing the class that you don't know about. Especially a "secret" that is not immediately apparent. It is not intuitive at all to think that you have to do an instance that is 30lvls below you for the best druid tanking weapon. 
---
You also will have the feeling of being "incomplete". You know what I mean? Like when you go to pvp, you don't feel "ready" until you look up a pvp spec for the class you want to play and get some macros. You want to feel "prepared" and it takes enjoyment out of the game when you know you're not. (at least for me.)
---
I shall humor you with a question.
---
Do you know what a bottleneck is?
---
Ps: 
---
For later in life when you get out of high school: You really come of as a dumb fuck with remarks like that.
---
If you think a 12-24hr cooldown is dumb you are equally dumb, as it wouldn't really limit who you play with? Once you're on a layer you stick to that layer unless you get invited to another layer at which point you stick to that layer till invited to a new one, etc. So you can invite anyone to your layer and play with them and they will stay on your layer. This way you can have your entire guild and all your friends on the same layer, only difference is you can't abuse the layer system by jumping 24/7 due to a cooldown. Sure, limiting layering to only lvl 1-10 (maybe first 2-3zones per race so 1-15) also works, but that means massive stress on the server due to overload. Layering helps fix that, and even at some point there will be massive amounts of people in Stranglethorn Vale so limiting layering to start zones might not be the solution. A cooldown to layeri g switching helps reduce the ways you can abuse it, while allowing Blizzard to have alot of people on each server due to layering.
---
&gt;It's 2019, world is more globalized than ever and we should start to think forward instead of isolating ourselves to our 4 virtual walls.
---
It's easy to say when your english is your native langage . But not everyone speaks it , and it shouldn't be a requirement to play World of warcraft . 
---
And in this globalized world , why should we speak english ? why not spanish or chinese since there's more people for whom those langage are native ? 
---
I'm french , i speak english , but i really would appreciate french only server , for all the people who natively speak french ( France , belgium , some part of switzerland , canada etc ) and i would like the same for german player as well . 
---
i really don't get why so many people are against it , since it won't affect them ! . 
---
So yeah , maybe for you in this globalized world , a chinese guy who talk to you using google translate is a " Delight " , but maybe for him , it's a fucking pain in the ass .
---
Pservers and Official servers target vastly different audiences.
---
While there certainly are a lot of players that are willing to go through the lengthy process of playing pservers,
---
there is a much bigger audience that simply doesn´t. Ignoring these communities has two massive downsides.
---
1) roughly one third of those players won´t bother playing at all.
---
2) roughly another third will play their way and alienate player bases from other regions with the inofficial server language being different to the official one.
---
I want both options for classic. I want post naxx content and the ability to take my warrior into TBC through wotlk.
---
So true. We need a real life classic.
---
Horde for life, sorry!
---
I was playing retail up until I started playing classic beta. I’ve had a tase of greatness and can’t go back!
---
Bantering among European countries is a wonderful bonding experience when meeting people from other European countries. 
---
I sometimes even get a couple of good jokes about Danes when listening to other nationalities bantering eachother, its all in good fun. 
---
I accidentaly ended up on one of the unofficial swedish servers as as swede, we even had a few raid members that did not speak a word swedish, when they needed information the raid leader went through it quickly in english or in chat. I'm worried a lot of people will make a mistake and not knowing it, even if I'm swedish I would much rather have ended up on a international server, had i wanted to play with other swedes I'd play other games then world of warcraft. 
---
"Tjaswe?" was the standard introduction amongst the randoms i groupe with as far as i can remember, its slang for "hello are you from sweden?", Once this was getting tiresome as they always forced you to speak swedish, bantering you with "lol why are you writing in english", i picked up on what some others did and answered with "no rus", forcing the group to speak english to keep keeping it much more civil and relevant compared to when 15 year old swedes wrote in swedish.
---
IIRC there was a niche at some point for unholy tank, but i didn't play DK in Wotlk, only priest and shaman, and my memory is pretty bad.
---
The last years of "retail WoW" have ruined "retail WoW" for me too!
---
thank you comrade, long live the great, glorious, and correct Blizzard
---
Multilanguage is indeed horrible but you can play on US servers from Europe now, and there are guilds being set up on US servers which raid at European time zones
---
Retail has a huge issue of over rewarding non content to the point if just spend some time you be the same ilvl as heroic raiders leaving ether casino like gambling or straight up mythic raiding for gear progress. And that is end game content they design that way.
---
Leveling in current is just awful rather than be challenging that you can make easier with side content it is all cake walk all day everyday.
---
Yikes! It won't be that bad, if it helps. With modern tech it's 220 ping for Perth to hit US West nowadays, so east coast will be even quicker. Hopefully we get servers here, but even if we don't, it'll be much better than vanilla latency.
---
I don't find it that much slower, personally. You definitely kill stuff a lot slower and are at a disadvantage in PvP, but your surviveability is amazing and downtime is crazy low. It's about as slow as lvling a holy priest... time to 60 about 8 to 9 days /played
---
Well considering how easy it is to fuck him up during the grind, its highly unlikely that such a big streamer like asmongold will get scarab lord since he will just get camped all the time even with people carrying him through everything
---
Blizzard has an office in Sydney. It would be really weird if they didn't give OCE servers.
---
Barrens chat will always be off the wall, even in current private servers barrens chat is as...interesting... as ever 🙂 wouldn’t have it any other way
---
That’s how layering was designed, not how WoW was. Sharding has been in the game for awhile and that works on a zone by zone basis.
---
Rend?
---
Im just joking around champ ;)   
---
WHOLE of europe is divided right now becouse of a game, one way to get people back together is finding a common interest. 
---
In europe its a common interest to make fun of americans, it just kinda always works :p
---
Kenny with the only CRT monitor lol. Kind of makes me wish I hadn't tossed out my 21" NEC CRT.

How is mouseover better than clique in that example?
---
Clique is mouseover, but you use the mouse button instead of a keyboard button.
---
Welcome to the good times of WoW. Now you understand the complaints from nostalgia players about retail. &lt;3
---
current wow ruined current wow
---
Not than DPS.  Than Mages.
---
&gt;Yes you can, but again, I'm pointing out that e.g. on ascension, even when the vast majority of the NA playerbase is asleep and it's mostly EU players, a lot of whom are not native English speakers... you still dont see a sudden influx of non-English into the channels.
---
I dont know why you keep bringing this up. I never said that it happened
---
&gt; Take a 150 mile trip to your nearest border and you're already in a foreign land which has nothing in common with yours, speaks an otherworldly language and doesn't really want to bother with you.
---
Yeah I agree Danes are so inconsiderate
---
Im sure that most people here prefer leaving this crap in the major bottleneck areas then layering the entire server/map.
---
This was very nicely said said I have a question how should my warrior friend build himself also you think you could fill out a build on a site for me ? I’d love if ya did that
---
yeah fuck blizzard if they think layering is a good idea for classic
---
Oh noes you it might take a few extra minutes to finish a quest. I'd suggest you stick to Retail or some type of FPS that is designed for people with the attention span of a gold fish and require instant gratification.
---
This really depends on how many people they let on servers. Full and high pop servers in vanilla were 2k
---
That's the server i was on, and it felt like i was leveling on a dead server.
---
Dungeon finder forces difficulty to be lower. 
---
With dungeon finder, everyone can get into a group regardless of skill or gear, which means content has to be trivial.
---
Yes it will be glorious
---
I'm really excited for classic wow, and I'll probably stop playing current when it comes out. But as a player who had never really experienced current's endgame, I'm having a lot of fun right now. But I also feel like I'll be bored with it in a few months.
---
The one on the left looks really similar to a road on larch mountain that I like to take pictures on. Looks great
---
I think once kids are a year old you no longer need to use months as a measurement.
---
I think it's also taught in Stonetalon for Horde, and Elwynn for Alliance. Not entirely sure though.
---
Better for me yes, I'm just saying that it's beneficial to the Germans, French etc that they are forced out into an English environment so they finally learn the language. Guess where I learned English? Being forced to use it in MMOs and other online games. 
---
What do these people do when they are on holiday? Sign language their way to the beach? I can't honestly believe that a huge fraction of gamers in Germany and France can't communicate in English. 
---
As I said, about half my guild is German and they all speak English pretty well.
---
No. They even said they werent in a blue post few weeks ago.
---
Nah, I spent 24/7 high for 2 years. I was unable to function when I wasn’t high so I can confirm I played the same high as I do now sober.
---
You would need to respec as a mage as well.
---
Everyone’s experience was different. I didn’t get into the beta, but had a blast during the stress test. Buffs thrown all over, grouped up several times when questing, chatted with those peeps too. Felt great. Not everyone buffed of course or wanted to speak, but even with some of those they got the idea of helping pretty quick.
---
1. Auto-accepts quests, so you don't have to read the quest text. -- The people doing this already don't read the quests, so this doesn't change that, it just makes it more efficient.
---
2. Auto-complete quests when you talk to the quest giver, without you reading the completion text. -- Again, we already do this, this is just more efficient.
---
3. It skips the cinematics and cutscenes for you. -- We already do this.
---
4. If there's a multi-page dialogue, it'd skip to the last page for you. No reading required. -- We already do this.
---
5. It tells you exactly where to go, and adds exact lines on the mini map for the shortest path. This removes the need for exploration and wandering etc. -- Efficiency.
---
None of your arguments are actually against this addon, you just don't like how some people play the game... tough shit.
---
The start of the stress test is the essential thing. Most people quit after few hours.
---
Yep it sucks, and reading through the different layering threads I’m surprised of the amount of people defending it.
---
And if it fails, open free transfers to low populated international servers, like in WoW classic, the biggest, oldest and poorest performance servers like mine, Magtheridon US, had free open transfers to less populated and newer ones. Not complicated and win situation for all.
---
Its still a thig for everyone. If you dont have to heal for a second you should dps. At the very least you pre cast an offensive spell for the pull.
---
I miss frost DK tanking so much...
---
Hopefully the playerbase that sticks around is the older playerbase so this is kept to a minimum.
---
Last tier I got a pair of 390 gloves from the world boss in stormsong. Mythic dropped 385 gear.
---
Dumb af
---
Amen to that
---
What are you talking about? Asmongold didnt made this happen. The same thing happened on the horde side too.
---
*Me and my mates
---
That speaking 4 languages isn't enough when there's 50 to choose from.
---
If they keep Layering it will destroy Classic. They need to disable it after Day1. The Retail-Scrubs will be gone and won't even make it to Level10 anyways.
---
Mate you won't finish any quests like that. Remember Ely launch? I do, it was better XP/hour to run your arse around gathering exploration XP. I don't mind competing for mobs if it's more like the modern private servers. A new server launched today with about 6k online and it was fine. Took me maybe one hour to get out of Northshire Abbey.
---
Don't forget with auto grouping and teleporting to somewhere means higher chance of ninja looting and ungrouping bc there was zero consequence.  No bad rep in trade chat, no nasty whispers afterwards, just grab and run.  So they had to change the need/greed system to simply auto loot for everyone, further deminishing the need to actually interact with your fellows.
---
why would anyone corrupt their own offspring with hordethoughts? i cant wait to purge people like you and your equals when classic hits
---
A lot of gaming subs are like this. /r/hearthstone, for example, is super downvotey
---
I was more talking about the damaging to heal thing, but yeah you're right.
---
You're confusing the fact that they're forced to use English due to their low population with them actually wanting to use English.
---
Damn private server players, we all hate private server players, always at it again

You know it (typing mobile is hard)
---
I'm not an expert by any means, but I'd imagine that implementing layering/sharding on a single zone that is programmed/created with layering in mind, is different from implementing it on a single zone programmed without it in mind. 
---
You might be right though.
---
I agree that the current lfd has a low difficulty barrier. I just don't think that it necessarily has to be this trivial.
---
Ah okay that's too bad. Thanks for the detailed response though it cleared a bunch up for me :)
---
oof

Yeah I liked it better when the difficulty of a dungeon was just completing it at all, partly due to classes being janky as fuck and partly because we just didn't know better. The dungeons were also way better designed with exploration in mind and not just a big hallway to clear quickly in mythic plus. The esportsification of WoW is really a shame.
---
The danger must have purpose. The reward must have meaning or the extra danger is just annoying.
---
I just happen to understand and speak a bit german as my 3rd laguage, dosnt count for alot of people - i know that :P
---
I see your point with the expression thing, but:
---
We are playing a game, not trying to build a new country...  Just find a guild for your country, but use english in world chat, how much do you realy need to express in vanila wow? Unless your playing a hardcore RP server.
---
@seitanpatty
---
I understand that you are from germany and wish for german servers?  :)
---
All the rpg elements, quivers etc, the sense of danger... oh boy I want it all back
---
People are objecting to exactly that. They want english realm german realm etc so they can play with other people who speak the same language. With just EU realm there is a language barrier.
---
&gt; Because if you roll on a DE realm as an English speaker
---
Why would you do that? Language specific realms always have been clearly marked as being language specific, so in order to roll on a German realm, the first thing you would have to do is switch to the rider labelled "German" in your server menu.
---
I literally waa just telling my husband that. Because i did the beta stress test. I looked to him and was like i dont think i can play retail anymore. Fyi i never played the original wow either
---
They should open the beta to everybody with a sub for a month
---
That should filter a big part of the tourists away, and it would give them a lot of time to test stuff
---
Dunno why they insist on testing layering with a big player pool for so short a durations
---
i mean there are still a lot of german only servers on retail..why wouldnt they do it in classic just dont get it.
---
Im pretty sure, english will be the only allowed language in public chats is it were on private servers
---
Im not english btw
---
I’m in beta and it 1000% has layering. Hell,watch a stream for 30mon and you’ll see it. Or some clips that get posted here...
---
&gt;in WOTLK
---
*vomits*
---
Farm the Arcanite Reaper recipe..
---
How? He was explaining how he had time to play alot and explained that he got a few rare achievements.
---
He wasnt going "I was the best character with the best gear. People would flee from me. I could kick anyones ass who tried to challenge me. You look at me wrong? Fireball to the face!"
---
Jajajajajajaja
---
&gt;Edit: Even just going back through the new posts in this thread people are admitting a lot of neighboring countries don't like each other, and that other threads and forums discussing this are filled with insults between people lol...
---
Its bantering, amongst European countries there is a strong sense of togetherness. When I hear finnish people talk about sweden it gets quite toxic, but then you realise that its the exactly same thing we do with danmark and that is fully for jokes and laugh, and what norway does to sweden, then you realise its kind of what the french does to the and the brittish and vise versa. In my opinion when push comes to shove we work it out (these days atleast, not historically)
---
Or perhaps you did not mean shit flinging amonst eu nationalities but towards blizzard or some other toxicity I've missed from this debate
---
Google Lights Hope. The new realm is called Silver Hand.
---
I logged in once during Legion.
---
I don't think I need to see any more.
---
Yea when you have 5 dailies per rep, they give you like 500 rep so you have to do them for half a year for “retention” and having 10 reps. 
---
I find repeatable quests ok, but why make them daily?
---
Even better is to have mobs drop items to return or combine, summon and so on as it was done in Silithus rep.
---
Not a bad suggestion, depending on your end goal. where would you put the extra 25pts?
---
Minority was probably a very poor word choice to use on my part, I generally make it a practice not to discuss topics I’m not well versed in but it appears I have broken my own rule today. You definitely have greater knowledge in this regard and have put a lot of thought and effort into this. Very well done. 
---
I wish I had more time to discuss my point of view with you, I enjoy the banter back and forth. I want you to know I have know problem and If put in yours and many others position I can guarantee you I would feel the same. 
---
If you haven’t guessed I am an American, and the majority of Americans are entitled $&amp;@!$. So when I see arguments of points such yours I naturally go into with “this person is one of those entitled $&amp;@@!”.
---
 However after this exchange at least in your case I don’t think that’s what it is. Please don’t take my comments as arrogance, I truly do see your point after the information you have given me. Thank you.
---
By the way, no chance of enjoying work, but I have put in for vacation a few weeks after classic drops.  Looking forward to that.
---
It's hosted by L1ghts H0pe
---
&gt; You say I'm "too lazy" yet after your second post you still haven't backed up your argument at all without providing any solutions.
---
It's the same excuse from you people every time. I've answered this question MANY times already. You don't win by just parroting "Source?"
---
There are many better solutions that *other people besides me* have suggested. It's not my job to educate you, do it yourself.
---
can't speak for him, i personally think the worst thing was the slavery of africans and genocide of the natives. could also be the more recent warpath the us are on.
---
Only 4?
---
You are overly optimistic.
---
Going to be like 12.
---
Thank you all for sharing your opinion and  criticism. Dont for forget to share it was all your friends. 
---
Hope i see you all in Classic WoW &lt;3
---
Layering is continent wide. You don't know how it works
---
Well the idea would be that it's basically just  a server from the player's perspective. As long as they have enough layers, and open more if the population goes up, this won't be an issue.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqnFnWSYzaQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqnFnWSYzaQ)
---
It is grindy but that's part of the game.
---
All layering is going to do is help blizzard cheap out and cause classic wow to be less successful than it could be. Even if it's for 3 months, that's time keeping each servers community segregated. 
---
I understand why they want to put as little money into classic as they can, but I'd rather see classic communities flourish from the start, instead of become stagnant, fragmented layers. 
---
Cute YT channel tho.
---
I firmly believe Kargoz create a lot of his content,  he's on the worker side. He get some info from knowledgeable peers but certainly produce the final form and conclusion.
---
Look also at Melderon, another analytic guy which i find really ressourceful (specially for shamans).
---
I upvoted your post and it went from 1.9 to 2k. Life complete. 
---
Ps. I agree. Vanilla WoW was the absolute best, can’t believe we’re lucky enough to have it re-released!
---
Make Azeroth Great Again!

If they make bfa free

Vanilla WoW was SO good, my friends make fun of me for actually missing the Barrens grind to level 20 and the 58-60 levels.  The expansions just kept making everything 500x easier, it actually pissed me off when they dropped the flying mounts by 200g cuz I spent two years saving my gold, finally got mine, and then a week later the cuts came lmaooo killme.
---
Chuck Norris jokes!!
---
When my group went to WC in the stress test we made sure to remind everyone in /1 that behind chuck Norris’ beard there is no chin. Only another fist
---
Unholy was a great tanking spec early on due to their ability to mitigate a monstrous amount of % magic damage.
---
I'm on about if you roll on an unofficial server
---
I remember having a mouse-over blind macro is vanilla, it's not a new feature.
---
I remember one of the game devs went to Riot. He was asked his favorite thing about moving and said "I don't have to design games made for everyone and his grandma anymore".
---
Every alliance starting zone is likely swamped, since gnomes and dwarfs share zone
---
Tauren is probably the only horde zone that’s not full, and Troll/orcs can run there in like 15 mins if you run south and swim to ratchet
---
Hop layers till you find him, sounds like you don’t pvp
---
I'd get rid of prowl and bite. Claw does all the dps you need and you can ignore prowl in mara by calling your pet only for bosses and leaving it on stay to dismiss it inbetween boss fights, which is what you'll do anyway once you're a gun at it!
---
Came here to say this. It’s takes less than a minute to figure out if general and trade are 100% German or English or mixed. Anyone who takes 40 levels to realize that doesn’t get to have a say.
---
Lemme guess - he wants to be warrior? =p
---
"It's all about me me me me me me! Why can't Blizzard cater to me! I don't care about the game, I just want them to care about me me me me!!!!" &lt;- This is you.
---
This is the reality. Also something that no one talks about, Layering will never be turned off on mega servers because it will be impossible to turn it off on such servers.
---
I'm seriously considering putting off playing classic and waiting for servers to stabilize and choose the right server. It sucks to start from behind but I would rather be behind everyone than ruining my experience.
---
Yep. I'm a casual player and none of these daily/weekly lockout things appeal to me at all.
---
Maybe I have a lot of time on the weekend, and I really just want to focus on grinding out that rep, or those professions. And then for the rest of the week  I ended up doing something else. I will be behind regardless, but I'm not really missing out on anything.
---
But in retail I have to basically login at timed intervals, or I get very solidly behind in a hard way on something random. God forbid I didn't know about it.
---
it doesnt really matter its swp + wand regardless lul
---
The ones that dont say anything, then after the first wipes and you give people instructions and wipe again, trying to confirm with them that they understood can even result in a ok. Third wipe you realise they they dont really speak english at all but are russians and everything you've written have most likely blown past them. 
---
I can live with broken english and google translate, i can't live with idiots that dont even try to communicate, and that is how the russians on private servers I've met handled them not being able to speak english. At best there was 1 dude that could translate to them otherwise they would not even confirm "rus?", just ignore you.
---
If you can't laugh at a fart I don't trust you
---
Layering is God tier baby ❤️❤️❤️❤️. Long live the ability to fucking level.
---
I mean you shouldnt need to make your own custom ui in order to make the game look playable
---
Ah yes extraterrestial advisors. Crucial to running any buisness
---
I'll fuck you up in WSG filthy horde!
---
It will let you view the information for one ability at a time, but you can use conditions for it.
---
For a useless example:
---
showtooltip [mod:shift,combat]Revenge;[mod:ctrl,combat]Shield Block;[combat]Sunder;Defensive Stance
---
This will show Defensive Stance when not in combat, Sunder when in combat, and Revenge and Shield Block when holding shift/ctrl while in combat (including their cooldown). Bear in mind that this macro doesn't actually *do* anything yet, it needs appropriate /cast text.
---
It's either that or dead servers in a month. Pick your poison.
---
That’s great; never forget.
---
Yeah but it was done by 1 quickly switching targets so you'd lose your combo points as a rogue.
---
Nope that’s done and gone. Just gotta wait
---
They'd have to cap servers at like 5000 max which means there would be crazy long queue times on launch week. No problem if you get to play but really bad for blizzard when 90% of people are sitting in queue
---
can someone post this to /wow? that way we can have a non 100-0 discussion
---
With success comes money, and with money the vultures arrive. The body isn't even cold, and the vultures begin to pick meat of the bones.
---
"You're destroying something we love!" says the community.
---
"These changes will create more engagement and drive sales. It's for the best."
---
Iterate on that about a million times, and here we are. This is my wildly oversimplified theory of what plagues modern humanity: our population has grown to the point where there are enough vultures to *literally ruin everything humanity has done.*
---
Do you have a source for them using cloud services? Seems like it'd be more expensive for a company like Blizzard
---
Unfair advantage!
---
To be honest, all the DPS have extremely easy raid rotations in classic. Like, mages rotation is just spam frostbolt.
---
Raiding is much more of a social experience. The challenges are in getting 40 people to manage the fairly simple mechanics and consistently raid.
---
See what you can get away with re raiding heals imo.
---
Alright, this shit is actually out of control. God forbid you cant camp somebody for an extended period of time. Now instead of logging off, they can try their luck on a new layer. Herb / mine nodes will not be a problem, there is 0 chance that hopping layers is max efficiency any time outside of the very first wave of 60s as each layer will be farmed by multiple herb / miners. By the time you hop one layer, you will be behind the respawning nodes on your original layer. Third point again 0 chance that spam hopping layers will be time efficient as chances are the quest zones will be equally distributed among layers unless again, you are on the cutting edge of the leveling grind. 
---
All of this complaining about shit that makes 0 sense to actually do in game outside of the very top of the leveling curve is infuriating.  The only real issue I can see is items like the arena master, which again outside of the cutting edge, will probably be fought for on each layer. So unless you are bringing a full group to each layer somehow, I cant imagine the farm rate to be that out of control.
---
Not to mention the things people are bitching about is fucking pathetic
---
You might've seen it by now but it happens around ~20 minutes in to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNlUAoEygwk)
---
A lot of people used a custom UI because they hated the one in Vanilla though. It's all personal preference.
---
This was my experience as well
---
Idk man, when I was younger and played on EU for the first time some guy asked me if I was Danish too and I straight-face typed "no but if I was I'd like to be raspberry."
---
**My mates and me
---
Guys, pretty sure sap/gouge always did that. It's just less viable than you think. Pretty much only duels, and if you're doing that shit in a duel people will just be annoyed that you wasted a minute of their time sapping them to build combo points. Shit, using BLIND in a duel was frowned on due to the cost, and how little duels matter.
---
Who were you in the party? Piedmont here, lol.
---
All around build not just mara build. Prowl is for PvP.
---
Oh no the 60 cant have his fun of ganking lowbies whatever shall they do
---
&gt;Now instead of logging off, they can try their luck on a new layer.
---
Attitudes like this is what turned vanilla into retail over time. Don't listen to this person, they are wrong.
---
Lol I have my addy too, but won’t be needing it because I’ve become one of those insomniacs that can’t sleep for days at a time without tranquilizers. Addy just makes me nauseous 😓
---
Yeah I wish they would implement some of the things classic has into modern wow, more challenging questing/enemies and more.
---
I do not like just one shotting and plowing through enemies while leveling, it's not fun, same reason I cant get into games like diablo because you can literally wear a blind fold and spam an ability and win against hordes of enemies.
---
Classic is more methodical in its approach which is very appealing to me.
---
For a pure Mara build, I wouldn’t take dash either.
---
Fair enough, then get rid of Bite imho!
---
Couldn’t agree more. 
---
But I can tell you this, there’s no one walking around with a ball and chain hanging off them now. 
---
The American Indians are building and operating resorts and casinos on tribal lands.
---
History is just that “History”. We can debate for days each country’s short comings past and present, but this post isn’t the place. Believe me I can hold my own on world politics it’s been my full time profession for 28 years.
---
oh no, getting camped is no fun, people need to level safely!
---
Granted, that's a bit of a problem on unofficial servers (though sitting in a capital and listening to trade, or joining /world usually is as good way of finding out about this early). Official retail, however, has designated server languages. The only way this would become an issue is if Blizzard insists on having *no* language specific ones, i.e. they ignore the player base clamoring for the way it's always been in WoW until now.
---
It's probably not an abuse but it's part of the mechanics that were knew by a small percentage of players. 
---
But in Classic a lot a players will know those mechanics like this or hunter tribute, using world buff to raids etc...
---
A small percentage versus the vast majority gonna bring some change in the Classic experience
---
Let me start by saying this: I think it's necessary to give feedback on this because subscribers are paying for a service and feedback is what may change a company on a subject.
---
After years of saying NO to an official vanilla/classic solution, Blizzard finally said YES and answered the demand for such a need.
---
After months of peeking through the streamers that got into the beta, anyone can feel the excitement about a WoW franchise product, not the kind of yet another expansion, no, rather the excitement of feeling great.
---
Great adventures, great role-play, great community, great rewards, great sacrifices.
---
Nostalgia is a tricky thing a surely Blizzard, you know that and anticipate a certain amount of quitters after the initial release (Blizzard actually has data to analyze so they know more precisely than us).
---
But if you know your clients (or more precisely a -large?- chunk of them) are expecting that "vanilla" flavor, why would you, in a modern era where technology allows way more than in 2004/2005, mix the language-bound communities together?
---
In the name of what?
---
* simplicity to deploy servers? that's not very consumer-oriented
---
* the symbolism of Europe? that's not very realistic considering the disparity in foreign language education across our continent
---
* the fact that servers might be empty after the initial on-boarding effect stops and players start quitting? well in vanilla Blizzard did offer free transfer from overcrowded servers to new ones, so you do know you have options
---
* your opinion that classic should NOT siphon away players from retail ? maybe you should address the attractiveness of retail with retail content, not classic?
---
* technical limitations? let's be serious and not even go there, you guys built battle.net two decades ago and its features are nothing to shy away from, you can do it if you wish so
---
* management decision? well, then, maybe, managers need to look at the management they're providing within and outside the company (between departures, having to let go of employees, BFA very bad financial results, fans outcry at almost every single announcement, delays after delays on every single content)
---
I mean, it's not like Blizzard didn't manage to do so in Vanilla with less than 500k players so we all know they can if they want to, so the real question is this:
---
`why would Blizzard kill a community-driven game by not making it easy for certain communities to gather and play together ?`
---
And being French, I know how bad my fellow countrymen speak/read/understand/communicate with the English language: it's bad, for many reasons (cultural &amp; educational mainly).
---
To conclude my little piece of feedback, I'd like to point out the obvious:
---
A client / service-subscriber has only so much power, he can vocalize his concerns but after being denied the audience, he has only one way to manifest his disagreement: his/her wallet.
---
Just look at EA when the CEO didn't listen to its community (or even tried the "you don't like it don't buy it then" bit) on Battlefield V pre-launch for a perfect example of this.  
---
Or, if we are to talk only about Blizzard matters, **just look at the numbers**. We used to have 14 million players during WotLK, where are we now?  
---
Legion gave something back for a little while but it didn't persist with BFA, let's all be honest about that.  
---
\[personal opinion: the -quite extensive- RP part of Legion might have had something to do with it, suggesting maybe that the *RP* part in MMO**RP**G actually matters\]
---
Anyway, please let us french, with all our flaws amongst which lies our very poor foreign language skills, have our own communities. Let the German have theirs, let the Spanish and Italians have theirs.
---
**If possible give people options, freedom; don't restrict them, that's what gotten us to Bfa with talent trees that look like a joke to anyone who played in Vanilla / TBC / WotLK.**
---
Sincerely,
---
A(n old) vanilla wow player.
---
Did you create a project on any addon site that I can bookmark?  I like yours out of all of them I've seen so far.

With apologies in advance...

---
Just add some fucking dynamic respawns for the first few days. Its 100x better than this layering garbage!
---
Very informative if correct. Thank you.
---
All these spergs constantly bitching about layering are making me want to kms
---
This is really important. They have a very limited amount of time left and besides fixing bugs, they also have to find solutions to the layering issues. Once they find solutions, they would have to test those as well. Judging from every beta ever, nothing big ever changes until after release.
---
We can hope that layering wont be (as) abuseable at release, but it is very unlikely that there will be big changes until then. And thats not being a "layering-hater", thats just realistic.
---
Yeaaaaaaaaaaaah, I mean it's like Mr Burns going up to a town meeting hitting every point on why Burn's power plant is so much better than new power plants. 
---
This post was almost a roadmap of what to say. Skeptical as fuck. 
---
It's all true, but the wording makes it feel canned.
---
Every one of Kevin’s streams has a phenomenal amount of insight into the MMO genre and what makes them great, and one of the largest factors is the community aspect.
---
I logged into retail after the stress test, and queued for a random heroic, and realized the reason I had such a great time on the stress test was the people I ran into and worked together with to accomplish simple tasks. And then a random raid of westfall by the horde led to a massive pvp back and forth battle which took up the last 3 hours of my play time Wednesday night. That was the most fun I’ve ever had in WoW, and my character didn’t level up or gain any gear at all. In retail, that is nonexistent, and I don’t think I’ll be able to recapture that until Classic releases.
---
Reading comprehension fail.
---
They literally said that there will be German language customer support. So all of this makes even less sense.
---
Agreed zoning into a dungeon together could also put you in the same layer
---
fewer.
---
Who?
---
Who else is going to be selling invites to based Asmogolds shard?
---
Going to be making so much gold off this, I can't wait!
---
You’ve never raided classic Naxx have you?
---
Then you’ve obviously never been grouped with anyone from the Brazil servers. It’s incredible how consistently terrible they are. Without a doubt I can say that if their name says xxxx-Azralon or xxxx-Goldrinn, I’m gonna have a bad time.
---
I have nothing against Brazilians (I was in love with a Brazilian for a number of years, in fact). But I speak English and Spanish. Not even my Spanish can help me with them. It’s like there’s some sort of prerequisite for them to not understand game mechanics. And that would be ok (I was a noob once too! It’s ok!) if I could just **explain** things. But I can’t, because my Portuguese isn’t good enough and neither is their English.
---
Now imagine that to the Nth degree with a dozen more languages. For our European friends to have a good time this game **needs** language servers at launch.
---
[I don't remember PVP being like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OPLHgw54h4)
---
Haven’t seen one about this yet. But sorry. Was just curious on people’s opinions.
---
What will happen when Orgimmar or IF is under attack on a different layer?
---
They aren't even his, that's the hilarious part. He doesn't get a dime from them, he's probably losing 10k a month in potential ad revenue.
---
I did it once too, but don't remember if it was before or after the changes.
---
Grinding together would only be good for the ones that only requires to be killed, not looted, as loot only goes to one of us, so would need double the enemies and thus have to wait for respawn :)
---
I don't know what server I'm gonna play on tho. Always been on PvP, but might go PvE this time just to not get ganked when grinding for the mount (then open a ticket to get transferred to a PvP one). Then there's several servers of each. But yeah, who knows, maybe we will do it together :)
---
Still 2 months left.
---
I have experienced similar, but that doesn´t make it generally applicable.
---
People tend to forget that there is a much bigger audience for official servers than there is for pservers.
---
And most of them just want to have a good time with the least possible inconvenience for themselves.
---
Europe did plenty of that too
---
Vote with your wallet, don't play until layering is removed.
---
I believe that the player-centric way to do this is similar to layering, but with static realm populations and aggressive merges when needed.
---
Clusters (21,000 active players) consist of various (3,000 active) Segments which all share a name pool for easy future merges. Dragontooth 1, Dragontooth 2, Dragontooth 3, Dragontooth 4, Dragontooth 5, Dragontooth 6, Dragontooth 7 comprise the Dragontooth Cluster.
---
Layering has too many issues for me: it's a megaserver that will feel similar to sharding: the person you quested with yesterday logged into a different layer today. Mobs, nodes, and people disappear upon group invite. People exploit it and you wonder if you should learn the exploit or just accept that the economy is getting more scuffed every minute. We've seen how exploitable it is in myriad videos. We haven't yet seen all the ways it can be manipulated. If the expected population decline doesn't happen on some servers then Layering will be around forever or they'll have to find a way of separating the population. Layering is rife with downsides and has only one advantage over Clusters: avoiding merges.
---
There’s also no reason to group up or strategize and use your abilities or think at all
---
I much prefer classic to the new wow. But I do think blizzard is worried about classics success. I dont think they are worried it will fail, I think they are worried it will be way more successful then the current platform. From what I under stand the money is the same for them no matter what version you play
---
Or.. Get this.. Which is the most likely..
---
They make it so it isn't as easy to hop layers.
---
The combined minds of Blizzard and the community can surely find a better solution, it doesn’t have to be “either that or dead servers” as you put it.
---
I'm ready for English, German, French and a bit of Slavic languages. I'm lost if someone speaks to me in Italian or Spanish unless I can guess what it is due to Latin languages being so similar. With that being said, I totally expected segregated servers and intended to roll on an English speaking server. I still think we'll have segregation upon release, though. It's just too idiotic otherwise.
---
Also...Dire Maul isn't even out until phase 2. Gold making for most 60's in phase 1 will be professions and/or grinding mobs in the open world that drop any grays that sell for silver.
---
Even the mara farm for a hunter will be basically impossible at that early gear level.
---
that would be unironically better than the shit we get now with leeway and layering, numbers are off but better than retarded legion mechanics
---
This is the real wow. Only 2 months ... and the journey begins.
---
1/10
---
Funny.
---
The way I see it the leader of the group won’t switch layer.
---
So as your friends login just invite them to the group and they will switch to your layer as soon as possible.
---
If they log into a rested exp zone it won’t be any time out of their day!
---
This
---
&gt;Well, their fault or not doesn't matter. The very fact that these people do exist is reality. The fact that they exist and will eventually turn servers into unofficial (insert language X) servers is a problem. Not for them, for the rest of us. It should be Blizzards problem since it will directly affect the people playing the game and their enjoyment of the game.
---
This is going to seem like a weird suggestion but try Divinity 2 original sin. I just finished it playing co op with a friend and it’s probably the best game I’ve played in a long time. Strong RPG with lots of amazing gameplay components.
---
The single only reason why Shadow may have an edge over Holy Smite spec is Shadow Word: Pain. Mind Flay does **not** give you more DPS per mana point before Shadowform. But it's debatable whether Shadow truly has got any edge over Holy Smite, because the biggest argument for a Holy Smite spec is that while the DPS per mana point is the same, Holy Smite way more bursty, so you spend less time casting, so you utilize Spirit Tap more efficiently. And because of less casting time, you will *also* spend more time wanding, which raises Holy Smite efficiency even more.
---
If you however level with a buddy and are a pocket healer, then it depends on whether if your Shadow Word: Pain can finish all its ticks or not (I'm talking all ticks for the normal SWP; not the improved one). If your buddy is a DPS class, and if he's remotely half decent, you realistically won't have time to get your money's worth from Shadow Word: Pain, because mobs will die to fast (especially on lower levels). So that doesn't make Shadow the lesser spec of at least up to lvl 40.
---
And even at level 40 you still can't make an argument for Shadow, because despite Shadowform boosting your mana efficiency for your *DPS*, it will cost you way more mana for your *healing* to keep your buddy up, because Vampiric Embrace and Power Word: Shield will not be enough, so you must heal, and so you must swap in &amp; out of Shadowform very frequently.
---
I am not and i i do Not think that i have to be. Seems like the biggest player bases are forming their unofficial servers (I've heard of an unofficial German and french server). 
---
So I really don't understand how this is better than just putting [de] at the end of the realmname, since that's what's gonna happen for the majority of the players. This just screws the casual players who have to reroll after some time.
---
“Accessibility for all” is corporate double-speak for “maximize growth/market share.” Casualization of the game was intended to spur continued exponential growth but it triggered a retention crisis in the game. Wrath churned through thousands of subs, gaining and losing players at a rapid rate. Blizzard failed to recognize that the low difficulty of Wrath hurt retention, and instead began ratcheting up the QoL and minimizing the role of the world in favor of funneling players into instances content. As soon as that decision is made, the instanced content inevitably had to be pegged to the lowest common denominator.
---
Look over there on the right (if you're not on mobile or app).

There's a box to show your flair on here ;]

DH tank was terrible for raid tanking in Legion and BFA but was extremely good for M+ behind DK in Legion and the best in BFA at least till Jan when I completely stopped paying attention. DPS spec has always been above the avg DPS at any given time. Only problem it had was lack of raid utility outside of mobility for some encounters and now it has the magic debuff in BFA.
---
People dont need to level safely, I would venture that most people on a pvp server will respawn and attempt to fight back initially if you are around the same level. But back in the day you only had one option when you were being ruthlessly camped, logging off, Now there is simply another option. 
---
Il admit there will be a slight drop in extended world pvp, but if you want me to cry that you cant camp some poor guy for an extended period of time, Its not going to happen.
---
bur
---
this exactly.  If they do this, they fix the major issues of avoiding pvp and such.  I hope they're testing some such solution, as layering abuse is the biggest problem we can see.
---
I don't mind running to an inn or hearthing to switch layers for an instance or whatever.
---
ATM Machine
---
I do agree, I would like to see servers without layering, but I'm 100% sure they will stick with layering, therefore I'm just looking for the best options available 😊 I don't think layering will be there for the full 3 month period tho, maybe up to 1 month, but we'll have to wait and see 😂
---
We defo need a list of unofficial country servers. Last thing i want is to end up on something like russian or spanish speaking server. I like to understand what is writting in the chat when I play.
---
Yeah, on every private server I've played, druids level 1 mana pool only allows for 1 cast of Wrath before being too low for a second cast, whereas on the stress test I was able to cast 2 Wraths from level 1 before being too low on mana.
---
From what I've seen from the 58 AV test vs pservers, the druid form damage issue seems to decrease as you get closer to 60, so I'm hoping the pservers got the values right for 60, but didn't have the correct scaling formula for 1-59.
---
Should've rolled Orc
---
What they said was they were slowing down substantially, unless I missed a post, in which case I apologize.
---
I think this is hilarious
---
Absolutely no offense taken,
---
Should've rolled Orc.
---
Newwwwww
---
*Resist*
---
Speaks and wants to speak are two different things.
---
You're making this argument in context of a game where 90% of content is 5-40 people only?
---
But that is pretty irrelevant to this discussion. The point was they just need enough to keep a full realm population after layers are disabled. Even before that happens they just need enough to fill out one layer really, since the important thing is to have the world populated and not feel like a ghost town.
---
wasnt it like October of 2001, with huge supply problems?
---
The alternative is that dungeon finder turns into "chain kick bad players/leave bad groups until you stumble upon a good one".
---
&gt;That makes them all late 20s to mid 30s. If these people are genuinely that old and still act this way, then that's a bit worrying. 
---
Nah, if anything I would think it is the older neckbeards who are the ones who get super elitist. The ones who are old enough to devote an absurd amount of time to their hobby and form an identity around it. You know, the comic book guys of the world.
---
You know I didn't realise there weren't even going to be I thought this meant Russian and Portuguese etc

He said on a stream he was losing close to 70k/mo but doesn't feel motivated to do anything.

---
In the spirit of coming clean, I'd also like to take this opportunity to say I **don't** actually hear the visual medium and I **never had** this particular conversation with any teacher. And despite what's written, I'm a human being, **not** a digital animation depicting a 2004 video game.  Sorry I misled you.
---
Did they not say its going to be there for the entierty of phase 1? That aint 3 weeks.
---
I knew either classic would take over bfa or classic would die within 3 no the of launch but now it's safe to say we've regressed back to 2004 as our primary game
---
Nope, I am not a native English speaker and guess? My country has a shitty school system, nevertheless having English classes.
---
All my English comes from internet, speaking with other people in game and using message boards like Reddit. If it wasn't for this game and international forums I wouldn't knew a single word of English.
---
Absolutely agree. I think to myself, if you are dependent to others, why should I write in German when looking for a group/guild/raid? If there is a guild refusing to speak English, I wouldn‘t encounter them in the game no matter what. They want to be with themselves
---
but people will be too busy playing
---
Awesome thanks for checking into it!
---
&gt; Clusters (21,000 active players) consist of various (3,000 active) Segments which all share a name pool for easy future merges. Dragontooth 1, Dragontooth 2, Dragontooth 3, Dragontooth 4, Dragontooth 5, Dragontooth 6, Dragontooth 7 comprise the Dragontooth Cluster.
---
This logistically just doesn’t ever work, which is why we have layering. We’re not ever getting anything other than layering.
---
Only four?
---
Got anymore fancy twitch emote words for us ‘spergs’? And ending your life because of layering might be a bit too drastic, even though the technology sucks.
---
They've also admitted they've done wrong in retail and are going to overhaul a lot of stuff, including doing a level squish. I, for one, hope this means that if classic is a big enough success that they go back to the old style talent trees in retail, as well as the difficulty.
---
The title is actually correct.
---
I am on the mobile app. Can you just choose what flair you want?
---
TBH, I'm debating myself about playing Classic at all.
---
There are some real shitty private servers out there, but also several good ones (the "N-word" specifically). I've played casually on these for years, and the more details I hear about Classic, the less desire I have to play it, for several reasons:
---
* Private servers are free, and you can have multiple accounts
---
* They're moderated for adults: no bans for using swear words
---
* No Blizzard launcher
---
* Leniency towards buying gold, which is controversial but I don't mind it because some people can't spend hours just to farm consumables, and the best items are Soulbound anyway
---
but most importantly:
---
* High population without layering
---
I know a lot of people despise crowding, but to me that's what made Nostalrius so damn great to begin with. There's 24/7 activity, competitive markets, and if you play on the server -- you play on the server: no risk of different layers, no transfers just to play with your buddies, and none of that emptiness retail servers struggled with. 
---
When you're used to \~8000 players average online, seeing a handful of people in OG feels depressing. Community is everything in Vanilla, and the more population, the more it feels like you're in a living, chaotic world. (But I'm not big on raiding so I realize it fucks with for example world bosses too.)
---
I guess ultimately it's a matter of preference. But Blizzard's idea of a "high pop" server is \~2000, and they still seem to have this obsession with moderating everything in the game. Not everything needs to be perfectly balanced, fair, equal or appeal to everyone. 
---
That sort of anal micro-management, is precisely what ruined WOW -- and many MMORPG's alongside it -- to begin with
---
It was the peak of wow before dungeon finder. Best classes, best raids, best lore.
---
I expect a lot of people to mistake the various channels in the game for twitch chat.  
---
It scares me.
---
Well said. It's a self-perpetuating problem, since people (possibly the majority) who are interested in an experience that pushes back a bit are going to leave once the puppet strings become too visible. When too many of them are gone and only the people who like being puppeted remain, you can only make puppet-based content.
---
No, I'm telling you that I had a mouse over macro. It was in vanilla. It's possible you're just wrong you know.
---
dude spot on.
---
Lol okay, you win buddy
---
While I agree that we wont get anything else at this point, why exactly wouldn’t this work? This in theory is by far a better solution. Sucks that Blizzard couldn’t think of this.
---
Better. Still wrong though since it happens at other places, is confirmed to have been like that in Vanilla, and has nothing whatsoever to do with layering.
---
why do you expect that?
---
Ooh I could use spam and egg breakfast please. Mango smoothie as welll
---
Very, very doubtful. I don't even think the beta is going to be around much longer, but that's just a random hunch.
---
I was in a 30man Horde raid on the LVL 15 test and we actually had trouble finding more than 6 Alliance at Goldshire and the gates of Stormwind so it really can vary.
---
Doesn't matter that someones always a shithead, because that doesn't give them a license to be a shithead.
---
Melt his face
---
Yes I've seen this idea a few times and it seems promising, however we are two months from release and I doubt Blizzard can pull off something like this in two months. I know they are extremely wary of merges and so am I, so that's probably why they won't do it. 
---
Also the people you meet while questing during launch have a 80-90% probability of not playing after a month. Either they reroll to something else or they quit because they don't like Classic. Even on private servers the population drops really quickly and those people definitely want to play the game. Ely went from 50k queues in week 1 to 2k queues in week 2 and no queues in week 3. I really don't think layering will be there for a significant amount of time, especially since they are zone based so if you get out of the starting zones early then you won't have this issue at all. 
---
The resource exploit has to be fixed though and I'm sure Blizzard is working on something.
---
Which is what is happening lol
---
But on which shard?
---
I hate this blame SJW bullshit. I hear it all the time and I don't think I've ever had an interaction where someone was a raging feminist/PC police. Mostly I blame the capitalist mindset. Studios are now run by the shareholders instead of the artists and they want money over everything. How do you appeal to as many people as possible? Dumb it down and make it easy. How do you make even more money? Fill it with micro transactions and pay-to-win mechanics. There's a pay $60 to skip leveling option for Christ's sake. And you blame it on women liking story more than action? Give me a break.
---
Certainly, but you can still have a conversation about why you like what you like.
---
That is why you make buddies with people who have 60s.  There are solutions, and they might not always work, so yeah the rare time that happens you'll need to switch to an alt, but despite the obnoxiousness of it, it was part of vanilla that you could be camped, and that was the price to pay for playing on a pvp server.  The world wasn't always safe.
---
I wont be camping lowbies, I'm not arguing from that perspective.
---
name of one of the druids
---
Current wow also has literally zero incentive to socialize unless you want to raid mythic. I quit at the end of wrath and went back for legion and it always blew my mind how disconnected I was from everyone else compared to back in the day. 
---
Remember when you were two hours deep into a dungeon and you just really wanted to kill the last boss but someone in the group says it's bedtime or they just have to go. So now one of you has to travel to the nearest big city to start asking for someone to replace their team member, then that person who accepts has to make the trek all the way to the dungeon. That kind of shitty shared experience created a bond between you and the other players in your group. That just doesn't happen anymore. Get a dungeon you don't like in the queue? Just leave. Someone pulled too many packs? Vote kick and instantly replace. Everyone in the game is just a number now unless you raid mythic with a guild. It's just fucking sad.
---
Yeah they can, but not in two months with a small development team. It's a miracle they even managed to evolve sharding into layering.
---
The rule is to remove the other party (my mates), The title isn't correct.
---
I august 26 2019 makes no sense
---
Me august 26 2019 makes sense.
---
his likely shitting on a child what
---
Im ok with it being one Server for All but id be more ok with language dedicated Server so i signed. Lets see what happens.
---
Nope. If I was up for that I'd be playing retail right now.
---
I feel like a pattern emerged where blizzard got too absorbed into their own designs that they missed the basic concept of "is this fun". Really strange considering "make it fun" is supposed to be their first company mantra.
---
And then backlash from the community makes their next expansion reel in those mistakes. But then they go right back into the same pattern on the expansion after. Some blame it on A and B design teams, but I really am not sure. It should still be all going through the same leadership, which would guide and approve designs. I think it's just that they get so caught up in their own design speak that they start treating it like a math formula.
---
 The only thing that really matters is the outcome, despite the best laid plans. If they could just keep that in mind more, and listen to the PTR feedback. Treating beta feedback as being too late to change direction is a fallacy. The evidence is there.
---
5 to 7 levels above?  Even with 5/5 Shadow Focus, the ability to do full damage on mobs that high fast enough to kill them seems...unlikely.
---
Current WoW ruined current WoW.
---
yeah, even with this sword spec is probably still better.
---
But how is that different than the current layering behaviour
---
If anything this change would make that better
---
Classic haters always bring up the really obvious things like being forced to heal in raids as a pally, but fail to recognize that the grand design of the game is VASTLY and OBJECTIVELY better. 
---
Sure there are aspects that are really not friendly for if you want to not go hardcore, but the ways they ended up solving those problems absolutely gutted the game. 
---
It's frustrating to see the state of the live game. They refuse to remove those destructive elements of the game despite the fact that they have other solutuons also in place to the problems in vanilla. The have over-solved so much shit.
---
[Sad Thrall is sad.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkUOACGtGfA)
---
Don't die.
---
Definitely agree on that. However it will be pretty awkward if you have to enter a city to group up with your friends. Especially in the starting zones. I gotta run all the way to SW to get into a group with my guildies? That's pretty silly. But they definitely have to fix it somehow.
---
No it did not, the world was seamless. There was no such thing as sharding or layering back then.
---
I know cause I was actually there.
---
Really don’t understand the point of lying about playing Vanilla just to make yourself seem superior to others. It’s definitely not that big of a deal.
---
They seem to be very scummy about this beta test.      I happened to sub 2 days before they announced you needed to be subbed to get an invite.  My intention was to try bfa.  I hated it alot.   And noticed the beta thing on my launcher and my account expired again and thought maybe they were flagging people who's accounts just expired as a way to get them back
---
I don't think that is even remotely the same. sub-communities in itself is not a problem, it is specifically when a sub-community is made solely due to language and thus make a language barrier between sub-communities.
---
Eve Online is also a vastly different game. The reason language based sub-communities cause a problem for WoW is due to the relatively small size of a realm. There really isn't *that* many players on even a full pop realm, so if a part of it exclude themselves (or worse, in case they are the majority exclude everyone else) it is a really big deal. For Eve Online there isn't this small realm problem, so sub-communities can be a player made "feature" instead of problem that it is for WoW.
---
And I'm french and I speak English perfectly even if I played on a french server in Vanilla. WoW isn't Duolingo
---
For me Wow vanillla was a game in french and I prefer to be playing with people mastering their language and speaking perfectly than dealing with people struggling with english when you go beyond basic communication as it is the case in almost every online game in Europe.
---
Arent Brazil players on NA or Oceanic realms?
---
Like I get what you are saying, that will happen, but I don't think it will be as bad as you think. Also as I said, I signed it, I agree there should be language based realms. You're trying to preach to the converted for not being converted enough?
---
LoL - "Spirit of Shame"  Perfect.  Thieving it.

Why do you want everything to be easy? You don’t have to play if you dislike challenges.

I remember a night we were trying to invade a kind of mage tower in Arathi for a really difficult quest, with a group of strangers. I took us almost 3 hours, and I don't even remember if we made it in the final, but damn I recall I had fun this night.

Streamers killing classic!!!!!! :-)
---
yep
---
My GF and I are planning on leveling as a warlock priest duo. Anyone have any ideas on what the best talent combo for that would be?
---
Yeah, I see what you mean - but honestly they are just random numbers because I'm not fully sure how many will be on a realm. The point is you only need some thousands to have a healthy population for a realm, and that is not even near a problem.
---
there's no point to r/wowcirclejerk anymore.
---
The entire thread is telling you that you’re wrong while providing numerous videos as evidence.
---
Why make the topic of you’re going to remain unconvinced regardless of evidence being thrown at you?
---
Must be all those retail players ruining your family fun time
---
Truly retail concept.
---
90% of the Classic players alts will be bank alts.
---
By the time real alts will be a thing, fiery weap enchant will be dirt cheap.
---
absolutely not
---
Ion will make it legal
---
There should be 1 more option for "I don't know what the hell I want to play in classic".
---
The people who whined about sharding are 100% to blame for this shit. They tried to do a system that helped people with their ""immersion"" because people were deeply upset with seeing players popping in and out. 
---
Should be sharding in zones up to like level 20 and non-existent for everything else. No reason to use a system that affects the whole game when it's an issue that should only affect certain zones. People can suck it up and deal with sharding for a few zones.
---
who cares what layer people are on. am I missing something
---
Let me be your shield
---
I'm very confident that, if layering happens, everybody who currently hopes that Blizzard will get it figured out are going to wish they'd joined the opposition to it that is going on now. Sharding and phasing are old technology and the /r/wow subreddit still has weekly posts showing the crazy things that happen with technology designed to warp you, your friends, and your opponents between dimensions.
---
That's only the case because they keep lumping in the Russians on EU servers for some reason. It's why you can't communicate with anyone in LoL, HotS, Overwatch etc. But Russians get their own servers on Classic so that won't be a problem. I've played WoW on EU servers all my life and I've never encountered someone I couldn't communicate with.
---
Even the AH was empty 😔
---
Druid Boy Chicken Wing
---
Hard to take Kevin seriously when his main rebuttal to world buffs was "don't use them if you want a challenge".
---
Perhaps on other topics he's more knowledgeable.
---
I was the shaman in your rfc haha
---
Got my vacation approved so game on!
---
yeah we know
---
The game lost the feeling that this event gave me sometime around mid to late Wrath. This tool me right back to 2004
---
Hit the nail on the head. The game was already a theme park, with rare exceptions like Black Rock Mountain. You could suspend your feeling of theme-parkness with how immersive the social aspects of the game were, and the tedious travel times. There were lots of books and crannies to explore, even if they weren’t fully fleshed out; and lots of attention to detail for very small but flavorful things like the citizens outside SFK turning into worgen at night. The game encouraged you to explore, and rewarded you for it.. but not by showering you with upgrades or AP, but by giving you that sense of immersion. 
---
Now the game is set up to make sure you see every little thing along the way, and that sense of exploration and immersion is gone, and all you’re left with is a densely packed theme park and very transparent player engagement mechanics with even more transparent time gates.
---
The theory is garbage just like every other alternative **because it doesn’t work. There’s so many problems with it and they are all incredibly obvious, it’s very easy to see why they went with layering.
---
Firstly, Blizzard isn’t ever going to name a fucking server dragontooth-6. 
---
What happens when the servers fold and you’ve got more than 10 characters on one cluster? You lose random ones? You exceed the realm capacity?
---
How does each layer handle server capacity? Can you just not login to a layer if it’s at capacity? You’re just fucked and have to make a new character on a new layer?
---
How does name reservation work? You can’t use a name even though no one in your world actually has it because someone in another layer does?
---
How do you change layers? Is it in the battlenet launcher or in game? If it’s in game then they are servers and what happens when the servers fold and you’ve got more than 10 characters on one cluster? You lose random ones? You exceed the realm capacity?
---
Jesus people use your noggin.
---
I had an addon for a prvt server back in the day that filtered out Chinese characters. I'm sure it's possible to do the same with other languages
---
Well, I think, the only reason they aren't re charging people for classic is because it will boost BFA sub numbers and make the expansion look like it's doing better than it is. After all, they have to get the next expansion approved where we all internally raid our inner demons in a solo raid. Maybe this time they will add the pet battle raid also.
---
Maybe for you, I tend to see them as equals that bring different things to the table
---
Did I say dislike lol?
---
As opposed to seeing no one for months because your on a dead server... Or can't login with 60 min queus
---
It definitively was the right choice, could you imagine back porting battle.net integration, directx 12 support and 64 bit support to 1.12?
---
I played from launch through 2007, eventually clearing all the way through AQ40... your assessment is 150% correct.
---
Can you explain? Leeway?
---
Imagine having to group to do quests..
---
I am just confused as to who you think is going to die once and then instantly hop layers, to create this problem. If you like I do plan on rolling on a pvp server, its because we enjoy the world pvp that comes with leveling, and that it makes sense that most people on the server will as well. 
---
Its possible to enjoy world pvp on classic while leveling, and also realize that having the sole alternative to being camped by one or a group of the opposite faction being logging out is not fun and engaging gameplay for anyone. And to that end, if a side effect of the layers if that players can escape a prolonged camping by hopping, I am ok with that.
---
Yep, you can do that. And I hope you have fun doing it. I have zero doubt it's objectively a shitter route, but I'm not here to tell you how to play.
---
The game definitely hasn't had the same draw for me that Vanilla through Wrath had until this stress test.
---
That's weird, I don't see Gamon anywhere :\^)
---
Mhmm, I still get on from time to time. Invested too much time in the game over the last 14 years to just forget about it.
---
Fuck for as much hate as BfA gets for clunky class design, a lot of the specs are about 5000% more fun than most of the Classic ones. There's not a lot of joy in a one button rotation.
---
No. Rebalancing all future raids for 40 aint happening. Other changes like no lfg and no flying are more likely.
---
I never liked shaman because there were a few things you depend on that only work on random procs. Never felt like I was fully in control and it drove me mad. Maybe I played wrong or it's just not my style but couldn't do it.
---
I'm going to be devil's advocate here. I used to have crippling social anxiety and grouping up the old way never happened for me because I was too scared to talk to people. I actually ran some dungeons with lfg though, and even though I was scared to death it at least let me get over that initial bump. My anxiety is no where near where it used to be, and I'm actually looking forward to manually grouping. But I don't think lfg is inherently evil.
---
Join the opposition? Who do you think you are, Han Solo? I've been throwing ideas for fixing sharding and layering to Blizzard for years in both Classic and retail since it was introduced in Wrath. It's pretty clear the clustering thing either doesn't work or the merges are too dangerous.
---
It will not "die" but it will rather swiftly lose popularity.
---
Get attune, spam BiS and get as much FR as possible, max engi, keep farming dunegeons til everyones ready for MC, sell runs
---
Same thing here. Was 15 when I started playing in 2005. I now have a group of around 20 friends and acquaintances in their late 20's / early 30's who all quit around TBC/WOTLK, never resubbed, and are all returning for classic. It's gonna be glorious.
---
Oh I totally agree with you on this subject. Classic is way harder and therefor allot more fun in my opinion then retail. But I got one very big doubt on classic.
---
When you reach level 60 and start raiding the raids will be cleared in no time. All long time players or decent guilds already know every tactic to every raid. I’m not a hardcore raider but even I know most content and tactics from all classic raids. So a decent guild will be more likely to clear a raid in a matter of hours and not days. 
---
My suggestion for blizzard would be to make new raids after the classic content. Start all over again. Skip everything else that came after. Use new lore. Make raids hard and keep them hard. Just sad blizzard proved to many people by now, including myself, they just don’t care what people think and that makes me pretty sure all the wishes people have won’t happen and classic will slowly die.
---
true. so, you believe they told the truth? you believe they want general EU realms to 'free up barriers' so all the german guys can play with their spanish friends?
---
Op is just trying to be a bundle of sticks.
---
No you are not missing anything
---
Can you explain why this wouldn't work? It presents a few bad days when/if merges happen but, other than that, is superior in every way from the player perspective. 
---
From Blizzard's perspective they'd just have to create sequestered Segments of servers with a shared name database. Then they'd have to actively monitor populations within these Clusters of Segments to identify when/if merges are needed.
---
I’m very confident that if layering didn’t happen we wouldn’t have a game to play, so deal with it.
---
If you can’t afford a few hours a week do you really think you should be playing video games where 40+ people rely on you?
---
Two weeks is too long because by then all the pros will use it to their advantage and be farming MC. Not sure if it matters though, as it seems the most efficient way to level will be spamming instances again and again. That’s how all the streamers are leveling.
---
got rused
---
Source?
---
Yeah what a fucking challenge it is to stand around for 10 minutes between killing mobs. Unless you are a class that can tag really quickly like a melee class or mage/druid after level 6 you won't get the tag on spawning mobs. Even in groups it's almost impossible with thousands of people breathing down your neck.
---

&gt;Mate nowadays most people speak native plus english
---
From my personal experience that is not true. Sure most people can some English, but it is not uncommon in some countries that people have quite a hard time with it. If they have a hard time expressing themselves in English and the opportunity to speak your native language is there, then they will take it. This can snowball to the point where if a sub-community of some language grows too big on a realm it might become a "official" language of the realm and cause even those that are good at English to instead use this other language if it is their native.
---
Thinking most people are good at English is being naive. For Scandinavia, British Isles (obviously) and a few other places it is true, but in France or Portugal as examples I've met so many people that don't speak passable English. Sure you can communicate somewhat with most, but it is clear many have a hard time with it. And there are even a surprising amount of people that you can't even properly communicate with unless you know their native language.

You realize mana tapping is a large dps loss?
---
No matter how bad it is, it won't be worthy of the meltdowns it's causing. It's just a game, not the defining aspect of your life.
---
I don't know the actual circumstances, but I feel like a very large portion of the ruining of the game comes from Ian. He is a very logical numbers based guy. He loves metrics and graphs showing increases. He thinks that making things more inclusive and seeing people log in daily rather than once or twice a week means that their changes have a positive effect on the game. For the life of me I don't know how they don't see the subscription graph steadily decline during mid wotlk and think "oh maybe every decision we've made since that point has been terrible". They think MMOs are dead and that's the reason. They're not, you just killed wow.
---
Are you just saying random stuff then?
---
The zone inn layer changing would wreck the economy like I said. You understand how much resources you will be able to farm in an hour if you can change layers in a zone inn? There should be a NPC in capital cities that they put in far away from the main attractions in the city who you interact with to change layers. It shouldnt be some toggle button, thats not very classic-esque.
---
You clearly don’t want Classic, you want what you thought Classic was going to be like. Layering is not Classic.
---
Are you?
---
It's a good suggestion. Prepared to be downvotes for wanting to discuss reasonable solutions though. Idk what took over this community but it completely changed from maintaining a classic experience at all costs to what ever it is now once the beta was released.
---
I agree that this macro is simple and would not be great for PvP specifically. When I wrote it for the other thread, it included a shift modifier to return to Defensive Stance, because it was for primarily tanking. I advocate personalizing macros to solve problems. An easy way to add a fine degree of control is modifiers.
---
It's not that flight is a mistake, but it trivializes leveling.  That's it.  Gating flight was a terrible idea and the reason I unsubbed.

You realize this was because his stream was kiting a 60 dragon into stormwind? People wanted to get into his layer to be a part of that. God forbid people have fun on the stress test
---
K bro cry more
---
Damn
---
This is why they need to make realms with 1 dofficulty. They can give flying and LFR to people on the kiddie realms.
---
I always thought the unofficial language of the internet was English.
---
Why does dynamic spawning “only go so far”
---
In theory it could go down to 1 second and no one would be complaining there’s not sufficient mobs. Obviously I don’t recommend that, but it’s clear that dynamic spawning can support a starting pop of any realistic number of concurrents
---
If you want to play with your friends, why not just invite them to the group? Why do you have to try and get on the same layer?
---
Hey I played back then, and never really touched Horde. By the time I switched factions, it was WotLK and I made a DK to save time, then twinked a BE Hunter at 19. By the time I made other alts it was Cata and the world had changed.
---
I got to experience a pretty large amount of Vanilla as Alliance, but nothing past 15 really as Horde. I've still got some new content to see. I know it's not going to be mind blowing, but it'll be new.

&gt;Unpopular opinion: French people are just salty their language isnt the global one.
---
That's not an unpopular opinion, though (except in France, probably). Honestly even in France I've met a lot of young people that jokes around with how stubborn their country is. At least that might mean the new generation is better.
---
I was thinking about that same idea just this morning. You have my vote.
---
Please, stop language segregation. That is not way humanity should go for.
---
Haha, i was only pointing out the alternative, which is grinding in that case.
---
The endgame of WoW has always been the same - aboring af grind for a marginal upgrade. Thing is, this grind was an adventure because of the player interactions.
---
Problem retail WoW is that it is basically a grindy single player game. Yeah, you are supposedly playing with other players if you use the dungeon finder but no one ever talks and you won't see those guys ever again after the dungeon so you might as swell just be playing as bots. Hell, they may actually be bots for all we know.
---
Basically allows you to cast spells attacks on players without targeting them. So say you're fighting a warrior, you see a rogue coming over. Before he stealths you can hover over his character and cast feirie fire without clicking off your target
---
Wiping really meant something as it was expensive as fuck and you knew if you wiped too much the group could disband too.
---
I know you're doing this as a joke, but just in case people are confused:
---
Stacking resistances on top of the Master Demonologist bonus from felhunter is useless in PvP outside of duels, as you're going to be trained by physical dps in every real group pvp encounter. OP is just doing a funny dueling build to smash mages even harder than usual.
---
How is it misleading? I literally ran through the main part of town and took a screenshot. I have never not seen it *completely* empty in my history of playing wow.
---
 Literally 0 other players!
---
Great idea!
---
One option is a bunch of bullshit. You can always leave for a different zone? Don't like being excluded from an area ? Get some friends or stick to pve.
---
You know, you hit the nail on the head with this. My retail friends don't really understand why I play on the private server and refuse to play the real game. They don't get why I ask them constantly if they are going to try classic when it comes out, and talk about how great it going to be when we start questing. They don't even see why I ask them what class they plan on maining. Maybe if they read this, they will get it.
---
You get random epics through quest rewards, mobs out in the world pose zero threat to you, you get teleported around through hubs and the LFG tool, and money isn't exactly tight: you don't have to skip on buying spells (if you'd still be required to, which you aren't) just to save that extra bit of money so you could hope to buy that mount. I could sit here listing shit all day.
---
I don't know what game *you* think you're playing, but yeah, WoW is like this.
---
Adding flying in the first place is one of the biggest mistakes they ever made
---
There is a fairly large opposition to the implementation of sharding in Classic. Are you implying that it's pretentious or vainglorious to oppose a majorly flawed alteration to the Vanilla rerelease?
---
WOTLK was the expansion where they started making a lot of "the boss will hit really hard for a bit and you need cooldowns to survive". DKs were amazong because they had the most cooldowns, in particular anti magic shell on Sartharion.
---
After 30 minutes of playing a new baby warrior, I realized how much of a difference all the years of understanding warrior mechanics and gearing makes.
---
Death and more death with a mild heal lean.
---
I never noticed that and I've seen this episode at least 10 times. Good eye
---
I know and layering will only exacerbate the systems that made that possible.
---
emphasis on the "pfffff"  or how do you make a fart sound in english? goddamn i ruined it, didnt I ?
---
I agree that people seem to be overacting to the level of layering currently in the beta build. It is likely that the devs are trying to find the best way to implement the system. The best way to do so is good old trial and error.
---
So, yeah, the layering will be rough as they're trying to figure it out. That being said, I think it is important for people at air their complaints. The devs need feedback on the layering systems just as much as everywhere else.
---
Yeah, it's been under 200 each faction, often dipping way belpw that.
---
So much for those people shouting "Blizzard has the client! Of course they are right!"
---
No it's not. Give us the option to pick layered or non layered servers.
---
And this would be okay, if that was the only thing layering was for - the the crowded starter areas. But it's also to combat the inevitable decline in players n weeks in and to prevent server merges.
---
So, when and if Blizz wants the server to have an authentic vanilla experience with server cap of about 3k people (IIRC), what happens in your scenario when you ding 15 ? or 20? You're thrown into a 5 hour queue for the people above lvl 15? I don't think that's exactly a great solution either.
---
not THE best, but other than SM/Ruin which has already been mentioned, 1/31/19 for hunter is very solid in both PvE and PvP
---
Id take that over layering
---
They themselves suggested this in the form of Pristine servers
---
Not arguing his point about that not being how it works. My point was that he had no clue about how layering was being implemented and was being a douche to people. 
---
There's a big difference between simply telling OP that that's not how it worked, and replying to anyone that commented on the thread that they are wrong, giving no evidence to his claim, being a condescending prick, and to top it off, by his own admission, got pissed because he made a bunch of assumptions and never bothered to look into the widely available info regarding layering.
---
Lmao. Better insult the guy right away so people know you’re a real classic boy
---
what a pessimistic opinion. Why? I feel like you personally want it to fail
---
This works if there was a reward.  Tbc heroic rewards were amazing iirc.  Gems, patterns, reps, tokens, not to mention the actual gear drops.  No other era had better rewards for dungeons.
---
We don't have a game to play so we just spend our time shitting on retail. I would imagine a lot of the retail hate will go away when classic is released.
---
Lol yea. Keep on thinking that they would just stop making WoW expansions.
---
Most popular but also most sought after dps 
---
If you are available to raid, there will be people that want you to raid
---
mehme :s
---
EU launch was also what, 2-3 months later? They had a better judge of what they'd need because of that. This time they're eyeballing things and are clearly anticipating it to be different.
---
Lmao. What a challenge. Waiting to tag a boar.
---
Typical wrath baby.
---
I would be pretty shocked if that were the case. It's not just about being elitist, it's about being vocally toxic and entitled, which definitely skews towards a younger, less mature demographic.
---
You have no idea how bad it will be
---
Finally playing in the stress test after years of waiting... super hard to go back to retail, but the gold ain't going to farm itself to pay for my classic sub.  Played classic to wotlk and coming back in Draenor was a real "wtf happened" eye opener.  I don't think they can fix retail, its a glorified collectible simulator, at least I get classic again in 2 months.
---
Ion has says layering will not work in phase 2 because of world bosses. They have committed to a drop time for it, just kind of an ambiguous one.
---
Yea we've already gathered that from your atrocious spelling.
---
It is peaking around 200...where did you get that 5k number from?
---
nochanges EU gets the game in November.
---
Which layer was it? 
---
Shard #14, layer #3?
---
*Sigh*.
---
Yeah....
---
Watching the slow process of WoW dying was a painful experience, be glad you get to have the inverse.
---
Also: the furbolgs you need to farm for frostsaber drop runecloth (and gold etc),and the grind is massive. you will be able to buy yourself the rep wit cloth turn ins long before you get the frostsaber.
---
I don't want it to fail, I want this stupid decision reverted. That's the opposite of wanting for it to fail
---
I played hakkar in vanilla, which was turned into an "unofficial italian" realm. As someone who does not speak Italian, it was a truly bad gaming experience.
---
Not sure if it'd be worth the time investment, but if you could level Gathering up quickly, you could farm rare mats like black lotus etc and just hold on to them. No competition early on will make finding them super easy, and you could just bank them and sell them later once the rest of the server catches up.
---
Of course, that would require you to level herb to 300, which would be a huge time investment on its own, so maybe not. But being the first high level herbalist on the server would be a very lucrative opportunity.
---
You underestimate the amount of research that went into private servers. Most of the bugs in the beta have been found *specifically* because it doesn't match private servers.
---
You are the cancer that gets Vanilla WoW to Retail WoW.  I knew WoW would be some what it is now what Blizzard catered to casual give me give me give me mentality.  You think it’s good, but it never is.  You might think I’m being hyperbolic but it’s true af.
---
Depending on how you do it, yes. If you have no way to mimic mouse clicks then I can see the following issues. You'll be restricted to tab-targeting, which can be unreliable. You'll be slow, since you'll have to keyboard turn. I don't think you'll be able to interact with friendly NPCs, since they require mouse clicks.
---
If you have a way to, say, move the mouse cursor with a thumbstick and bind left and right clicks, then you can do absolutely everything in the game. Hell, you could probably PvP at a high level with the right class and good macros.
---
I mean aren’t they planning on turning off layering completely eventually?
---
Did you do a /who ironforge at the same time?
---
Even if layering is only in the starting zones, it should be severely restricted. I’d rather get DC’d then have the layers switch up on me. I have nothing against streamers, but there truly is nothing more entertaining than one getting frustrated with things not going their way.
---
If I end up raiding at all it would have to be some variation thereof, but I also don't plan to even look in that direction until I have two characters at 60 so that I can properly enjoy leveling and professions without the pressure to "hit 60 and get geared".
---
I think for the non-hardcore group raids should be viewed as a pull mentality (do we have resources? Let's clear something) rather than a push mentality (we will clear Naxx!). I'm thinking of having a guild focused on more accessible things, like 5 mans or other non-raid 60 content. If there is enough development to pull out 40-60 people who sign up for a consistent schedule, create that spinoff group and prep it for the first available raid. Then that group can figure out what kind of schedule it can do for, say, the next two months (spitballing here, idk how much time is realistically needed to clear MC, for starters). At the end of the two months, regroup, adjust schedule, consider if you still want to run that raid.
---
I think any non-hardcore guild that is highly focused on raids specifically is going to have, err, issues.
---
What’s wrong with mix 30’s soccer moms? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Not for this, unfortunately. You'll just test it in game. A common bug testing strategy is to use show and showtooltip to see what the macro is trying to cast.
---
Honest question: why does there need to be a compromise?
---
Why is it so bad to go to town and talk to other players?
---
At some point this antisocial idea crept into the game and killed it from the inside.
---
Aroha preez!
---
Why is it so hard to understand that playing a game is a choice not a right. Just like its a choice within Blizzards rights to either offer a certain thing or not offer it. You should probably either get over it or find another game to play.  just because you feel entitled to something it doesn't mean you are.
---
Well, if you're in the US, a lot of Game Stops still have them.
---
I'd rather they just disable the ability to switch layers at all. Just allow players to choose the layer they want to play on when they create their character, and keep the layers separate until they get merged. Doing what you suggest solves some problems, but the community is still completely destroyed.
---
Great idea, at least never layer zones which has very valuable materials in them, like 40+.
---
It's not really going to make it worse long-term though. If Blizz allows that sort of thing to go on, certain groups are going to get to that point regardless of layering. And once it gets to that point the layering will be irrelevant. Them getting there a bit quicker isn't the issue, nor is it going to effect a casual player who is going to take months to get to max level to begin with.
---
Yeah I don't necessarily disagree, I'm just saying it's still better than the current layering situation.
---
I gave you the patch number. There's a million different resources with them - pick one, lazy ass. Nobody is doing your homework for you.
---
Bobby B has broke containment?!
---
Slower progress. The feeling of getting rewarded. Roll on a low population server if you want no company.
---
This is sharding, not layering. How does a 21 play with a 19 in your scenario? Blizz will turn off layering as soon as possible. If that's when the majority are level 20 that's when they'll do it. The current system provides the most flexibility.
---
Haha I wish. I just wanted a hearty and fun beta and now it's a bit discouraging to go on because it's cutting into the experience too much.
---
Blizzard need to do layering for non city faction controlled zones only and 2 weeks maximum.
---
The best defence is a great offence
---
The og wow devs and designers were mostly D&amp;D nerds who spent 90 hours a week working on the game by passion, that's amazing
---
Idk why people get so upset about that leeway stuff. I thought we wanted #notchanges ? And before you accuse me of just wanting it because it'll make me more op: I'll be rolling warlock.
---
&gt;US servers (in literally all games) are far far far more social (and obnoxious) 
---
How exactly is being obnoxious better? Some might just prefer to not talk before they have something to say. That's not the same as not being social.
---
&gt;scandinavians are in no way shape or form as social (which has become a political issue in recent times with immigrants failing to adapt to the “introvert” culture).
---
Honestly you shouldn't speak too loud about this, you seem to not understand anything about it.
---
Actually, your whole comment is based on stereotypes and somehow generalising EU to being unsocial Scandinavians and the rest refuse to use English.
---
If we are to just use stereotypes then I honestly won't even start to talk about how much is wrong with America, I'd reach the length limit on this reddit comment before I'm done.
---
alli player....
---
And now it's been tested and we're telling them to remove it. Are you suggesting we wait until launch and just cross our fingers that they'll take it out last minute?
---
WoW retail is like an arcade game for me now, I just can’t do it anymore. Classic is my only saving grace.

I'm rolling a rogue instead of a Huntard.(I fell in love with the rogue during wod and need to earn that Bloodfang set regardless of the cost)
---
But I'm commenting because I'm interested in this thread and don't want to forget.
---
Sounds like you've never played classic
---
That's not how that works.
---
No it’s not. I’ve died so many times pvt servers because mobs kept spawning every second.
---
The idea is to keep everyone past a certain level on the same layer always, say layer 1. And everyone below can be on any layer depending on group, guild, or whatever criteria Blizz uses.
---
Those aren’t the only options.
---
Yes and every one has been melee. As if they weren't already a liability compared to range, they're also super overpopulated thanks to all but 3 classes having a melee dps spec.
---
To elaborate your point, using CC and working together was how four real life friends and I got through SM Cath at level 37. When we got to Morgraine/Whitemane, the two warriors (each with a healer) tanked and pulled them apart. Then the DPSer helped burn Whitemane, and then we steamrolled the Morgraine.
---
I'm not seeing them on chrome either.
---
That's actually a really good point. Retail players don't really hate classic, they hate the players who want to play classic. Most of us just hate the modern game and don't really care if someone else likes it.
---
Why all this drama? Ion just said layering would take place only a few weeks. Then it will be gone and you will have your 2004 Vanilla experience.
---
I agree, layering is a more complex and less elegant solution to the problem than what they originally purposed; sharding for low level zones.
---
Sharding the early zones was the perfect solution. No pvp is possible for the first ten levels, and realistically for the first 20-25 for most, at least on launch day without going out of your way / doing wsg. There is not really any impactful resources to be gathered - there’ll never be a copper or linen-mafia, and even if you tried, the gold per hour from farming multiple nodes will result in much less than actually just leveling regularly. 
---
The world opens up more than enough to support a larger population over level 20, with multiple areas to do quests, grind and instanced content all the way to 60. 
---
All in all I think it’s obvious that the best case scenario here is that they are developing this tech to be used in retail to make the world feel more alive and populated outside of capital cities. Worst case is obvious enough. 
---
This much effort for a problem that doesn’t exist, and radio silence for with regards to the issues that are actually impactful, is kinda worrisome.
---
Yep
---
Easy. Level 19 will get pulled into main layer with level 20 and the rest of 20+. Everyone under 20 will be in whatever layer.
---
It definitely is a lost battle when we're already in beta and close to release. Nobody can make a huge change like clustering that close to release. If you want to fight a fight then make them implement German/French etc servers on EU. That can still be done and plenty of people are shouting about it.
---
I think they chose the solution that is most beneficial to their business. Whatever the detailed reasons are we can only speculate in a very unproductive way.
---
I wish they would, beta is starting to die out. Seeing about half the amount of folks online that we used to.
---
Bite does more damage though... Your pet will have way more dps if you teach it both Claw and Bite.
---
My favorite rep grinds have always been token based/ mob based. Imo the best rep grind in the game was to get the earth warden for feral druids in BC. You could either run dungeons all day, or you could stealth into steam vaults all the way to the area with this on elite and easy to kill normal mobs. They had this freaky quick respawn time and always dropped the tokens you needed for the turn in plus gave you a little rep. The packs were tough so you had to root one hibernate the other and kill the third. It’s like the grind was made for druids just like the Earthwarden was. I still remember I was about 1/4 into exalted when I stopped grinding. I had an inventory literally full of tokens and I turned them all it at once with just enough gold to grab my weapon and throw agility on it. Tanked Kara for the first time that day too.
---
&gt;It's funny how you can see all these problems that flying creates and the measurements that Blizz takes to try and contain them, yet fail to draw the connection between the problems and flying.
---
I don't thought because I don't think flying is a root cause, so stop trying to make it seem like I do. For two of the examples I think you are pulling strings. Areas can be designed with flying in mind and not just become Trivial.
---
Wold pvp isn't dead because of flying (I agree it is a part, but a very small part). Things like tanks and healers being unkillable, Crazy long cc, goblin glider, being able to whistle/hearth/changing shards, or just flat out turning warmode off when its inconvenient effect it way more then flying. People have to land for world quest lol. 
---
People choose the path of leasr resistance and generally getting killed 15 times by some bored rogue isn't the fun path for anyone but the rogue, it's pretty logical why people don't like world pvp.
---
 But sure it's all the flying... /s
---
DK tanking was already incredibly unique, with all three specs being viable for both dps and tanking depending on situation.
---
And I, in turn, never stated that we HAVE to have dedicated English servers. I merely pointed out that was the original status quo. Also on a side note, it does make life easier if you dont have every alternate message in e.g. trade or Lfg etc being written in a different language from the last.
---
If you group up you’ll all enter the same layer if someone is under level 20
---
And just think, Blizzard thinks classic will fail so badly they can't even support one of those.
---
A classic experience wasn't 10k+ people all jumping into a server at the same time.
---
Honestly the whole "racist tag" is getting thrown too easily. It is not racism to understand that there are different cultures and  norms. It is not healthy to just try and ignore that in fear of being "racist", it is far better to just acknowledge it so it can be embraced and worked with so it can be best for everyone.
---
That’s exactly the same for me. Great games come and go, but eventually it gets to the point where I’m just thinking ‘this is great, but it’s just not wow’.
---
Even genre changing juggernauts like CoD4, Skyrim &amp; BF3 have not been able to fill the hole left by wow.
---
Sign me up.
---
No but here's my logic. German/French servers would need at least 2 per region, one PvE one PvP. But one of each isn't likely going to be enough to handle all the players at the starteven with layering, Classic is going to have a giant surge, like we haven't seen in years. Now you get 4 or 6 language specific servers.
---
Then comes the drop off, there's always a drop off, and they expect the Classic drop off to be larger because, well it's old content, with a really grindy barrier to entry. They have a lot of numbers to work with for this, from modern play rates, to Vanilla retention and leveling numbers.
---
Now lets say you spread a thin population out across the 4 servers. Say the Germans gravitate towards PvP realms. You might be able to keep two running, but one of the PvE realms is going to be a ghost town. You're gonna have to merge it or let it die, both things players hate, even more so with the time investment that comes from Vanilla.
---
Every spec has a pretty obvious rotation designed by the devs, which is actually pretty lame. I liked it better when you just had 600 spells and you had to figure out what the best series of spells was.
---
Super easy. Of you are level 20 or 25 whatever the cutoff is you are locked to layer 1 always and cannot hop layers. If you get an invite from lower level they will get pulled into ur layer.
---
No it won't be the same, private servers are only one server so everyone is forced to speak a global langage.
---
On classic servers, communities will apropriate specific servers to make them unofficial french/german etc servers.
---
Retail servers during Vanilla were 2.5k at “Full”.
---
You can disable custom subreddit looks. All subs look plain as fuck to me.
---
"Your personal healslut"
---
It's misleading because you're implying layering is at fault, but if less than 100 people are online total, it makes sense IronForge might be empty.
---
You don't understand : it's not that they refuse to watch anything in English it's just that they can't. It's like you (I mean the non French) can't admit that most people here absolutely don't understand English at all.
---
Would you watch a movie in Chinese or Russian ?
---
If it's not dubbed nobody would watch. Even subtitles are very rare, only niche artsy movies.
---
I was sorely disappointed when I discovered the real voices of Schwarzenegger and Stallone ! And don't get me started on the voice of the blond woman in CSI : Miami (which is called "The Experts : Miami" in French).
---
Honestly same.
---
I started messing around in private servers towards the middle of legion and I fell in love with the old game
---
Legion was a good expansion and I enjoyed myself, but the old game is just so much better designed than the newer stuff 
---
That being said, vanilla wow with newer bosses I think would be badass, I appreciate the fact that boss mechanics have progressed to more complicated levels
---
&gt; Firstly, Blizzard isn’t ever going to name a fucking server dragontooth-6.
---
Why not?
---
&gt;How does each layer handle server capacity? Can you just not login to a layer if it’s at capacity? You’re just fucked and have to make a new character on a new layer?
---
Same as it was in Vanilla and TBC. If you choose to sign up for an overpopulated cluster then you face login queues. You have many alternatives to sign up for that have no queues. The choice is given to the player. 
---
&gt;How does name reservation work? You can’t use a name even though no one in your world actually has it because someone in another layer does?
---
&gt;How do you change layers? Is it in the battlenet launcher or in game? If it’s in game then they are servers and what happens when the servers fold and you’ve got more than 10 characters on one cluster? You lose random ones? You exceed the realm capacity?
---
There are no layers. If you're talking about Segments, then they'd be viewable in a server list just as servers have always been selectable. 
---
During merges your characters are transferred into the new, combined Segment. 
---
You'd have a total number of characters allowed per account on any cluster, so if the limit is 10 then that's all you get across the entire Dragontooth Cluster. Not sure what you mean about capacity. Realm capacity refers to active player logins, not total character pool, so there would be no realm capacity issues since the merge is designed to join two servers with known player populations. 
---
&gt;Jesus people use your noggin.
---
You've presented a bunch of solvable or nonexistent issues and then accused me of not thinking. Interesting.
---
I did that, was fun.
---
And neither is 1080p+ resolution and playing at more than 30fps and less than 200ms. Neither is starting out with the 1.12 itemisation and talents. Neither is being able to play at all during the first few MONTHS. Remember this? Constant disconnects for months even years for EU at least. You want that back too? Do you want the entire population to magically get mind wiped so we don't know the optimal boss strats and leveling routes too? 
---
Classic will not be like vanilla. It will be like a private server that won't suddenly disappear and hopefully without corrupt GMs selling thunderfuries and rank 14 characters to highest bidder.
---
Played Hunter till rank 11. Deciding on going holy paladin this time around. I just want to spam 1 button and heal endlessly in pvp.
---
That's not at all what I said.
---
oh no, the Chungus has permiated to the WOW. The end is nearrrrrr......
---
Chunga chunha cgunga chunga, chunga chunha chunga chunga.... aoooooooga... chung ouuuuu chunga ooou.... chunga chunga come for you.
---
The pros and cons are very much subjective there are plenty of players that would be happy to risk a dead realm to avoid layering on all of them. Give players the option to pick.
---
No, 2.5k was concurrent players not the actual population. The pop was anywhere from 5 to 25 at what point character creation would be locked.
---
&gt; It's amazing how these systems designed around player retention statistics just end up burning players out.
---
In the end, it boils down to intrinsic motivation to extrinsic motivation; If you play because you have fun playing, the reward merely gives you a reason *to have fun*. But as soon the dev "egg times" that reward, they decouple it from the "having fun part": You no longer get rewarded for doing what you like doing, you get rewarded for sitting out a timer, and "what you like doing" has devolved into activity without purpose.
---
So you start out with intrinsic motivation - when you get rewarded, it feeds back into you, doubling your fun. Then the dev switches to extrinsic motivation, and *that* always just takes energy out of you - which is why, sooner or later, your energy reservoir is depleted; You are burnt out.
---
While you were raiding top 200 I got a PhD in Economics. But nice of you to make assumptions based on thin air while you throw out more baseless accusations. And before you reply with "then you should make more sense" - any bystander reading this exchange will know who's right and who thinks they are. 
---
Now go back to your cave and jerk off to your achievement points while you inhale your own farts. Blocked.
---
It’s dumb to oppose the best solution to a problem we have. Is layering good? No. Is it better than everything else? Obviously, so stop complaining about it.
---
Hahaha this made my day
---
Rolling with a holy priest instead of a warrior, recently picked up a healing class for the first time and I can't go back now.
---
I am excited for being useful as a mage again. In classic WoW we were magical gods who could make the best food in the game (I think? I didn't play enough at lvl 60 to actually remember) and teleport players across the world. Frost mages were the crowd control kings in PvP and a good one would definitely turn the tide of the battle. 
---
In retail WoW mages are just useless magic casting hobos who for some reason can only cast spells from one school of magic.
---
There is such an easy solution to this.  All the Axis powers go horde and all the Allies go Alliance and only RP war crimes.
---
but for reals, why would you use a death knight, demon hunter, or monk flair on a section that is vanilla wow
---
As everything is balanced on the 1.12 patch the earlier raids (mc/bwl) I have been informed are relatively easy to clear compared to how they used to be ,and once you've learnt the bosses can full clear it in around 3 hours so it shouldn't be so bad
---
Attunement and pre raid BIS. I'm pretty sure a very early MC pick up raid will happen as soon as 40 people are 60.
---
&gt;But there is no such thing as their chat. It’s called EU servers, not british servers. 
---
They're literally flagged as English servers mate
---
When did classic have millions of players logging in and leveling at once? I must have missed that.
---
I'll probably try it at some point. I was so done with the game with WoD though that I've had zero interest and still have zero interest installing the modern game.
---
You were close, it's pfffffftt
---
You could always apply poisons by gouging, I am not so sure about sap but my gut feeling says it’s new.
---
This would be okay, but I'm thinking that the implementation would be quite messy. I would be okay for layering certain locations such as the race starting zones (e.g. northshire abbey).
---
Farm devilsaurs for a week with a group.
---
EA wants to know your location.
---
But that’s what I said.
---
Man I don’t know what you are doing to go oom as shadow while levelling. Apart from shadow is one of the strongest levelling specs in vanilla and more often than not you should end fights vs 1/2 mobs with full health and 75% or more mana
---
One of the problems is that if its based on level, PvP players would get annoyed. Yea, its kinda evil to get on a level 40+ and attack level 10s, but it is part of the experience, since the other half of it is requesting aid from level 40+ from your faction to come out and clean them up/patrol the area. This also happens in PvE as well, but instead of attacking the players they would attack the NPCs, which flags them for PvP allowing for your factions high levelers to come by and attack them.
---
I don't want a fight at all. This really sucks. This is supposed to be Classic but they're going to shard the first 3+ months, with all that entails. 
---
I feel bad for the Europeans and will support them in hopes that Blizzard sees their error there but I do not have energy for that topic.
---
Truth is Blizzard has no way to accurately predict how long it will take for player populations to dwindle out.
---
Welcome to the Brotherhood.
---
I’m not downloading that sack of trash onto my laptop again! I need ample room for Classic and I barely have any storage as it is! Also, does anyone know how to uninstall WoW and Starcraft? My PC is having issues getting rid of those files for some reason.
---
I actually disagree that keybinds yield more clarity. Once you have your muscle memory, how often do you actually look at your bars to decide what to do next? The only thing I do is check cooldowns or conditional skills (like Overpower), you can showtooltip whichever skill cooldown/conditional is in your macro (even when it isn't the active skill). If you have multiple kinds of those skills in one button, you can change the showtooltip parameters, but it's more likely you should spread those abilities out. Or you can spread only the showtooltip out across multiple macros.
---
For example, say you have mod:shift Overpower, mod:ctrl Sweeping Strike on button 1. You could showtooltip Overpower on that button, and #showtooltip Sweeping Strikes on button 2, which actually uses Slam (or whatever). While this would be confusing for a clicker, if you're using all your abilities through keybinds then you've already got muscle memory to activate what you want. You just need to see the cooldown information. Like a fighting game doesn't need to display all of its control options at all times.
---
I think they need to do it at one point or another. Because the accessibility is cannibalizing their own content. Why the hell would I care to do Mythic or Heroic if I can just do Normal and call it a day. I get that the challenge is there, but if you aren't one of those super competitive people then you will never be motivated to participate in the higher difficulty settings. Which separates the player base and makes it so everyone sticks to their comfort zone - there's never a challenge. 
---
Fixed raid sizes that account for deadweight and encounters designed around utilizing the unique tools that every class offers instead of emphasizing personal player performance (DPS, HPS, Mitigation) should be the way to go if we were to have only 1 difficulty setting aside from LFR.
---
Literally this. It gets so annoying lol there two different games with two different playstyles. Who cares what you like, doesn't affect me. I haven't really cared for retail since wrath, but it doesn't affect me if you do. 
---
If anything, I feel like a bunch of retail players are stoked for classic.
---
I was the third horde 15 on pvp realm 15 for the stress test, which was the most populated realm. The guy who got second place and I kept running into each other and there weren't enough mobs. We tried to separate layers a few times but couldn't. They may already be trying something like this to account for those ahead of the pack being alone.
---
What decision? Oh I got you.
---
Well the primary language on retail rp is English on mixed servers so..
---
It's just so baffling to me that a European nation can be so illiterate in the lingua franca of the entire world in 2019. You can visit small dustcovered huts in the middle of the African savannah that speak English. I did last year.
---
I feel sorry for them, English is the most important language in the world. Not learning it hinders you in so many ways. 
---
BTW watching famous movies overdubbed in German is pretty hilarious. I haven't done it in French though, I'd love to see the terminator speaking French!
---
I hope they do a remake of this episode for classic release
---
How can you say that it's better than everything else when there is a Cluster system that would offer a verbatim Vanilla experience with the only downside being a merge or possibly a few?
---
Vittra is their best album, by far but good to see this.
---
Fair enough.
---
Tbh I was probably assuming a bit too much, lots on here seem to think deep sub is the only pvp spec for rogues, but dagger+deeper assassin talents was very good in pvp, though I agree with you that seal fate wasn’t taken until later.
---
A pet can only have 4 active abilities. I'd drop bite and keep claw, dash, growl, and prowl.
---
Other than that I recommend +90 arcane, frost, and shadow resist, mainly for resisting CC in PvP. 120 nature resist for Maraudon farming + CC resists. Prowl kept at rank 1. Claw, dash, and growl max rank. Put remaining points in natural armor.
---
Problem with LFR is you just teleport to a super dumbed down version of the raid with no mechanics at all that any casual can complete without effort like a random daily quest
---
If LFR was only like a group finder it would have been fine.
---
It compeltely takes away what makes raiding great
---
*private server player plays the game better than some other people*
---
REE THEY'RE LITERALLY CHEATING REEEEEEE
---
Yeah, rotations SUCKed super hard in classic.  Mages and warlock both get screwed in this regard as they essentially have a one button rotation in classic.
---
The classes with the most interesting rotations in classic is rogue and fury warrior, IMO. And hunters if you like weaving aimed shots.  Literally every other class has either a super boring rotation, isn’t really viable for dps in raid settings, or both.
---
**Note** roles in 5 man dungeons are much more engaging for everyone.  Mages get all kinds of fun things to do in dungeons between CC and AE.  Warlocks can multi dot and sometimes either CC or tank with their pet (and a very few Warlocks are good enough to “fear kite” with fear and that one curse).
---
That's like being pissed for receiving a bucket of poop, and in response receiving a truckload of poop instead.
---
Yep, and it got drowned out by classic discussion.
---
Streamers won't even be an issue if you check what servers they are going to before deciding your realm, there are only a few big streamers to avoid the rest will be relatively small
---
Everyone overlooks the small stuff, many of which you mentioned in the OP. Many grains of sand makes a big hill. In retail, they try to go for a few big rocks and in the end, just doesn't make quite as big of an experience.
---
What I don't get is why blizz actually went through with these changes? They are the ones designing the game, they should know how much of a negative impact these changes would have on the game. I mean, hell, I was all for flying until I actually got my mount and realized how much flying will kill world PvP and player interaction in general.
---
Terrible idea... although after doing the level 15 NA stress test this weekend the starting zones were insane. I think I spent 2hrs in the undead spawn area just trying so find a single mob to tag and kill. The mob ratio to player was just insane. After seeing this and experiencing it. I'm on board for layering in the starting zones. I don't think it needs to be world wide at all.
---
And if you ding 20 while the main layer is full you just get booted from the server.
---
Same if you try to group with someone 20+ while you're still below 20. It just tells you that it couldn't form a group because the main layer is full.
---
Druid or shaman for me then.... allthough I dont like the feeling to be forced to heal in raids :p
---
I'm not fully caught up on the situation.  Can someone explain the problem that Layering is trying to solve?  If wasn't in classic, then why have it now?
---
As per previous blizz post they were testing extreme settings. From my observation sever 3 was max layering and server 15 min layers.
---
You won the Internet
---
Layering isn't going anywhere dude. The anti-layering circle-jerk here is absolutely not going to change Blizzard's mind. It's a done deal.
---
Yea, I leveled exclusively as holy through Vanilla, TBC and most of WotLK ... I never realized how painful it was until I tried out Shadow on a whim.
---
Don't grind as holy.
---
I mean, as long as the bottleneck isn’t too severe, most players will leave their respective starting zones within an hour or two and spread out more. Some, in the case of Night Elves and some Dwarves/Gnomes, will head straight to Elwynn and clog up that area instead. I think some zones are gonna be a complete shitshow while some others are just fine and will only be slowed a bit the first week or so.
---
I had a ton of fun trying to solo RFC.
---
I just wish they would let us play more, even if they just kept the 15 cap :)
---
But then you have places like humans who were (if i a remembering correctly) the most played race followed by a lot of NEs will make the run to SW because NE starting are sucks. 
---
So stay the hell away from SW and maybe go NE for easiest start.
---
It does suck for those who really care about the community and that. I honestly believe that if you really want to play "vanilla" (not classic) and all that "vanilla" means then wait to play until the launch zerg has died down. 
---
I know this is wishful thinking of course, but it is what I'll recommend people who are looking for that close community feeling. Maybe log in day 1 and check the hype, all the people, take a few screens. Then log off and wait a week or two. If private server launches are anything like Classic will be then there will still be plenty of people starting out weeks after, but it won't be completely swarmed.
---
You're probably not wrong. I think the explosion of the playerbase at wrath was because people who played WC3 but not WoW started playing because of the Lich King. Then blizzard started catering to the "wrath babies" and the classic / tbc community got drowned out.
---
dwarf paladin? :)
---
Classic is a dead end and retail is dying. Will warcraft finally die?
---
You keep it for uncontested zones, which last until about level 20 as far as I remember. That's plenty of time for tourists to get bored.
---
Inb4 next expansion
---
Brewmaster was pretty OP when it came to tanking. Guard was massively strong in throne and siege.
---
&gt;Why not?
---
Because it’s an rpg and they are Blizzard and they wouldn’t ever do that. Fairly obvious.
---
&gt; Same as it was in Vanilla and TBC. If you choose to sign up for an overpopulated cluster then you face login queues. You have many alternatives to sign up for that have no queues. The choice is given to the player. The benefit is that, wherever you choose to play, you'll play with the same dudes and dudettes tomorrow and the next day that you met today. No people disappearing from your reality for a week at a time as they log into different layers than you.
---
It’s like one of the primary benefits of layering is to allow people to actually play the game, but I can see why you’d be for a system which locks people out for days due to queues/server issues. Good point.
---
&gt;Yes
---
Bad. Imagine not being able to use a name because someone you never see and can never interact with has it. Imagine if you can’t use your name on dragontooth because a guy on malfurion has it. Lmao.
---
&gt;You'd have a total number of characters allowed per account on any cluster, so if the limit is 10 then that's all you get across the entire Dragontooth Cluster.
---
The realm caharacter capacity is 10 chief. What happens when you exceed 10 per cluster and they start shoving them together?
---
Last line critted me
---
Okay so i was not the only one. Any info on what's going on? 
---
For others: I dont have an active subscription to retail.
---
The primary feature of the game is "massively multiplayer". We can't test that part of it because there is nobody to interact with.
---
I am for layering at launch. 
---
After experiencing the starting zones with my wave of invites it would become unappealing to play. It needs to be busy but the right amount of busy with a lot of tourists who won't continue past lvl 20. Let's be honest we want a fun launch with the right amount of people in the starting zone. 
---
But after that when you get to contested zones and such there are a lot more options of where to go and dungeon's to do. This split, plus the multiple layers makes it completely empty on certain layers. There's nobody around in the zones at all. I hardly find anyone! Looking for wpvp is challenging because there is nobody to find. 
---
People also ask in chat or whispers to hop layers as well for ganking avoidance and it works. This is very bad for the game because there is supposed to only be one world. Only supposed to be one chest in stv arena. If someone is ganking call some friends to help you kill the ganker. We come to classic wow to solve problems together not take the cheat way out to get to the solution quicker. 
---
Just my thoughts to help make classic a solid launch
---
Sorry for shitty formatting. I'm on my phone and it's nearly 3am here
---
Exactly, he loses all credibility thinking hour one won't be the highest population. No idea what he's talking about.
---
&gt; Areas can be designed with flying in mind and not just become Trivial.
---
Name an example of an area that is not indoors where flying does not trivialize access to key mobs or items.
---
The entire WoD treasure hunt is made obsolete by flying. On top of this it's 100% unneeded. There is nothing that flying gives you that is essential to the game. It's just downsides upon downsides. Only upside is convenience but convenience is the root of all many many problems of modern WoW (instant dungeon teleports, random group finder, easy difficulties, easy world mobs, lack of immersion ...)
---
Yea it feels nice not having to run to the dungeon entrance for 15 minutes, but it comes at the cost of the world being a world with physical limitations that you have to live in and travel through. It's an RPG.
---
No kidding, I thought about this a couple years ago and think it's not even a dumb idea, Blizzard should make a L4D-like WoW game for you. Where you go into a lobby of varying sizes, invite your friends, select the content you want to do (raid, worldboss, dungeon, you name it), everyone selects the spec they want to play from a list, select the difficulty, hit "rdy" and then you get ported straight there, do the selected content and be done with it. 
---
When people see the world as an annoying obstacle that needs to be bypassed as quickly as possible, I wonder why Blizz even bothers building a World at all. Just build encounters or dungeons and let people select them L4D-lobby style with custom made spec-loadouts and unlockable items (for achievements like boss kills or dungeon clears with certain special requirements like nobody dying).
---
Because I absolutely see no point in building a world, and a questing experience when people fucking hate questing, leveling, equipping chars with drops and having to actually traverse a world to get somewhere. 
---
Don't take my rambling personally. I just don't get why you'd want noclip to be in an RPG. Because that's what flying is. A cheat that let's you fly around in the world and avoid any conflict. Just like playing Half Life with noclip. Zoom straight to the end of the level. Straight to the mining node. Straight to the named quest mob. Because the journey on the ground is just too tedious.
---
To be fair, it's been one every other expansion
---
TCB - none
---
WotLK - Death Knights
---
Cata - none
---
MoP - Monks
---
WoD - none
---
Legion - Demon Hunters
---
BFA - none.
---
The real trick in Classic raiding was as simple as having a guild where people would show up consistently.  If people would quit at a rate quicker than you geared people, then you could almost literally never progress past a certain point
---
Don't bother me or my son ever again, you hear me?
---
Writers don't dictate game mechanics so this quote is worthless.
---
Okay, I guess the way humanity should go for is forcing people to use a language they are not comfortable with while playing a social video game in their spare time?
---
This ideology talk has nothing to do with this decision, no one is forced at all to use a language-specific server - it's about the choice and I don't think that's a bad thing for humanity.
---
Played mainly pve as a troll Resto shaman.
---
Will now roll on PvP server and focus more on casual PvP as a Tauren Shaman.
---
Might as well call those "layers" realms.
---
Nothing on EU
---
Really hope an MMO breaks this trend.  Healers DPSing, tanks DPSing, DPS DPSing, no true utility classes, basically everyone ends up being the same role.  Need to get back to tanks being tanks and healers being healers.
---
No idea -I just noticed. Of course I tried to login but servers are not up
---
What? You thought I actually hated streamers in game? No, I made a joke about people being upset about it and you got mad.
---
I have no intention of playing classic and most certainly not retail before they get their shit straight.
---
Nah, if just one person reads it, and then listens to the actual recordings of Ion about the timeline for layering so that it changes they’re entirely wrong assumption about it, then it’s worth the negative Karma.
---
We also dont give af about the player though. Old wowheads want retail to crash and burn under the heel of classic.
---
There is no layer full. They have capacity to have 10k ppl per layer. It would be insane to play bit they no longer have technical limitations. 
---
I was on server 15 before shutdown and we had thousands of ppl in one are. The server lagged but it was because everyone was in one are on the same layer. In reality layer has no capacity if ppl are spread out.
---
Don't worry the retail folks are too casual to ruin your classic experience in the future.
---
You aren't the only one. I've played since release. Now after having the opportunity and binging a few hours on Classic - I can not bring myself to play current WoW. It's just so unsatisfying and boring. I've told my hubby so many times how current WoW is just too fucken easy and Blizz holds your hand through everything. WoW USED to be a challenge!   
---
Now that Classic is back he can see the truth.   
---
Now I'm just waiting on Classic release to actually play and grow my main char again (when having a main actually meant something unlike the plethora of capped alts I have now).
---
Classic.
---
Yeah I can see it being harder too. That’s insane! I never raided much so probably gonna go that route this time .m
---
&gt;They think MMOs are dead and that's the reason.
---
This seems to be the general feeling when it comes to MMORPGSs and video game developers. MMORPGSs aren't dead... it just seems that the gaming industry as a whole forgot what the fuck a RPG is. "No, no, no... no way someone would want to role play as someone else. They just want to kill stuff. The world is just a stage for them to kill stuff on, no need to put much thought into it." seems to be what every single MMO developer thinks these days.
---
So what I take from this is that you value convenience over a sense of truth in the game world. That's a fair way to feel, but it is fundamentally opposed to what Vanilla was. Unfortunately I fear that some of the people in power at Blizzard share your perspective.
---
You know the old saying "those that can't do, teach."?
---
Those that can't make it in hollywood, make video games.
---
Here's how layering works:
---
1. On launch, Blizzard intentionally lets realms hold more players than usual by dividing them into multiple layers (continent-wide shards)
---
2. As the realm population decreases over time, the number of available layers also decreases, keeping the number of people you see relatively constant
---
3. Ultimately, each realm will have only one layer with all players on it
---
Layering isn't a solution to overpopulated starting zones, and that's not what the alternative is. The real alternative is to have more realms. Realms that could be mostly empty a few months after launch.
---
Most people are just farming bis gear and playing wsg now. Super boring to watch beta streamers aswell.
---
Ion said a few weeks. Stop spreading the wrong information.
---
While I think this sounds nice, it won’t do anything towards the massive dropoff in players which they expect to happen. Layering is basically servers that you merge after a while, doing it this way we would have MASSIVE queue times for people that are level 20+ OR end up with MASSIVE servers. And in a world without dynamic respawns it would become unplayable and not vanilla like real quick.

---
Gods i cant wait to ruin some Alliance days ganking as rogue.
---
That's because of the level cap. If people could get to 60 and do raid content they wouldn't be losing interest. Only so much you can really do at level 40.
---
I doubt it
---
I disagree, personally. It's the only thing that actually ever got me to play a healer.
---
i feel this shit in my soul, op, i started in cata and the fact that bfa isn't very good + trying out a mystery server just totally killed it for me, at least for the time being
---
The ones in the boxes are the more valuable ones. Yennifer goes for around $70 now.
---
Me and the boys*
---
There was 3 people
---
This has some of the same issues as current layering, doesn't it? What's to prevent people from hopping around the sub-20 layers looking for spawns, or getting an invite from a sub-20 to get away from high level players?
---
This also means that, if a high level Horde wants to go gank low level Alliance, they need to get an invite from a low level Horde person. Otherwise, if they go to Northshire, it'll just be weirdly empty.
---
Some would argue that point FOR classic. In classic you had class identity.
---
Ian has only had 100% of the game’s control with BFA, with influences in Legion like Mythic+.
---
The game has been going downhill since mid-Wrath, with sore spots like Cata and WoD.
---
Before Ian it was Holinka, and before Holinka it was Ghostcrawler. Out of hundreds of devs this game has had over its lifetime, not one man is truly responsible.
---
Probably will get lost but I feel like they’re completely different games and playing classic has put retail in a new light. Made me appreciate both. Can’t wait for classic
---
As opposed to the hole you crawl up?  Does Asmongold like you up there?
---
You should be able to play without layer.
---
No, they didn't say that.
---
Woke af
---
ZAP! :D und ja, genau der
---
That's wise and would be a good solution if they were sticking with the old plan to shard the first 20 levels but we're talking about Layering for many months now. I see no way to have a Vanilla-like experience if that system goes live and players are disposable strangers who you don't see again on your shared megaserver.
---
This happened last week.
---
Honestly, I think it's rather get a truckload of poop. 
---
At least there's a novelty factor to it, rather than just getting a literal bucket of shit.
---
It is litteraly Diablo, after D3 RoS the majority of the Diablo team moved to WoW.
---
World quests are litteraly a copy of the advanture mode and bounties system in D3 RoS.
---
M+ is a copy of the rift system in D3.
---
Titanforge and item procs are a copy of the randomized loot of diablo
---
Artifact power/Heart of azeroth is the paragon system from Diablo.
---
legion legendaries were also a copy of the diablo legendaries
---
Each of these features  came in Legion right after the D3 team joined the WoW team.
---
This is precisely why I'm ultimately glad I didn't get a Beta invite. I got into all of the stress tests so far (when the login servers let me), but the short-term taste has done nothing but whet my appetite for when Classic goes live. When my friends and I are playing Classic (four of us have made plans to group, complete with tank and healer), I want the content to still have that "oh man, I'm getting to play!" feeling. (I did, however, have to make a run for Org in the recent stress test, just so I could stand on top of the bank again.)
---
Welcome to the right side!
---
Why would you have massive queue? First off the server capacity is huge, it is artificially set at 3k. Second the level 20 can be dynamic as well. Layering is only needed to make sure ppl can get to like level 20 or 25, by then ppl will spread out and some will stop or slow down their play. Blizz just needs to survive first week.
---
Break yourselves upon my body !
---
There were many other cases like this too that I remember. You would see their names first and then the character would appear. The max distance was definitely a bit on the low side. If you would run on a road and a guy came from opposite side, you would see each other very late, maybe 10 yards sometimes if you had a mount.
---
Live to win, till you die.
---
Was the stress test on the live servers this week? I was traveling and missed this one :(
---
Bump. This mechanic is retarded
---
This will be me. I stopped playing BFA when we finally got our classic release date.
---
you'll never get comfortable with it if no one forces you to use another language.
---
3 people in the entirety of ironforge, it would be normal for there not to be anyone in this specific screenshot. The beta servers are dead at this point, not the layering
---
I was Loxer but there were so many alliance I doubt I was even seen by anyone
---
Troll feels really good too, 20% heal reduction with good range and no CD. Shadowguard feels really good at 40 when you respec into shadow form build. Those blackout procs are righteous. And you can throw heals pretty fast when you get low with the racial. 
---
I've also just played UD for far too long so it just feels new and refreshing.
---
Everyone in power at blizzard shares my perspective, because it’s the correct one.
---
There’s no fucking point in making a game that people can’t play because of server issues. Imagine making a game in 2019 and having it be unplayable because “oh it’s authentic.”
---
Seriously. Get over it.
---
Another layering advantage: single economy. Another layering advantage: ability to flex layers up and down during primetime/lowtime. Another layering advantage: your whole guild can roll on a server before it gets cut off or your friend who joins late can play with you. The list goes on and on.
---
Looks like Maraudon to me, not sure if that specific still actually exists though.
---
Just as empty. Maybe one or two running around whenever I am there
---
I mean layering is not really meant for low pop, in fact it is literally for the exact opposite.  I would imagine it is based on a % of people there and someone has to be in every layer, at least while they are testing the tech.
---
Hmmmm, maybe should look into warlock more.  But as far as caster dps went, dotting things has never been my preferred style.  The thought of being trained by melee isn't fun either :(
---
No one does it precisely because flying and the shitty design direction killed it. There's a reason ppl are madly excited to have it back - the reason being that flying, guess what, is a problem.
---
Same. Nothing on eU.
---
You said "The moment I knew I would never see retail WoW the same was after queueing up for RFC in classic."
---
What do you mean "Queueing up for RFC?" There is no dungeon finder. How did you "Queue up"?
---
You don't layer locations. You still layer the entire server. You just lock anyone past a certain level to the same "main" layer.
---
&gt;  is confirmed to have been like that in Vanilla 
---
That's bullshit.  Next time spend five minutes browsing Youtube before you make false statements to avoid looking like a jackass.  Here's a video that contradicts you.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OejAdnhUDzg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OejAdnhUDzg)
---
&gt; has nothing whatsoever to do with layering 
---
Also incorrect, it relates to how characters view and interact with each other in the world, so I'd say it's very related.  It's also application of related technology and they result in similar things.  The point you were trying to make is that it's functionally different that layering, which I agree with.  That does note make it unrelated.  It's a different application of the same effects.
---
Yes they are on NA, I just assumed you are on NA as well. And I’m speaking more to your “I don’t think it will be as bad as you think” comment. It will. It certainly will.
---
So basically i wont miss 60% of the player base since i have never played with them anyway. Is that what your saying? Not a valid threat from their standpoint.
---
Your*
---
All the low levels would need to get "unlayered" while grouped with a high level for this to work. A level 20+ cannot must not layered under any circumstance or we just have the same problem again after all.
---
It’s because it’s a feature introduced in later wow expansions; and that’s what the client is built on
---
classic shouldn’t have these delays or issues
---
It really depends on the macros.
---
Keep in mind im still in a hardcore retail arena mindset, classic has way less cd's and stuff to keep track on in real time
---
Wait, queue for RFC? Did they enable Dungeon Finder? lol
---
Tbh I think retail players are mostly sheeps and will play whatever is the most popular
---
I’ve installed it a few hours ago, EU here.
---
Every time I go to Orgrimmar, chat is the worst thing I’ve ever seen. I loaded in once and it was about beastiality and if animals could consent or not (I’m hoping it was just trolls arguing yes). I’d rather just read “pog” or “omegalul” than some of that shit.
---
I played undead rogue back in vanilla. Now im going to play alliance and probably druid. I just dont have fun only dpsing now.
---
I thought it was meant to be a joke
---
This is my build I’m going to support a warrior and rogue. Not sure where I’m putting the last 5 talents but you can still dish out damage and have some faster heal casting and totem buffs to keep you going. 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/-0525200105023151-50005301
---
Which for sure would be a bonus but it's also completely not necessary for a Huuuuuuuuge part of all countries with another native language
---
They 100% would’ve done this even without asmon. Baron Geddon was in org, angry Dev in sw. it’s nice he captured this, but they’ve done this before, even 15 years ago.
---
Massive queue times because they plan on having the realms be the original size. Layering is basically «Server Name» 1,2,3,4,5 then merge them together. If you stop layering after level 25 then they would all be merged together I assume? Which means unless they’ll allow 15 000 people on the same realm all being 25+ then you’d need queue times to have the cap be at 3000.
---
There are going to be two things you need to do for this.  
---
1. Everyone you encounter on the way who is invested like you make contact with them.  Your going to want people working with you.  The content is far harder than modern wow, this is a good thing though.
---
2. Prepare yourself economically, this is something you will also be doing as you level.  Grab two gathering professions as you level, mining and herbs.  Bank everything you find and hold onto it as the economy develops do short sales for massive profit.  Gold is hard to get as a player and not an investor.  So don't respec all the time, don't buy gear and DO NOT buy materials early game.  Your focus is going to be mounts, then attunements and reputation at 60.
---
 3. (Bonus) Have fun and don't make it a job.
---
&gt; a bunch of fresh 60 with no +hit and low mana pools would probably have a hard time getting anywhere in MC.
---
​I would expect the first rag kill to be roughly 40 of these people, though.
---
Cant wait for the unofficial Brexit server
---
Though clique was the one for managing health bars, it’s been a bit since i played.
---
Just like in legion. The layer always went to the higher level player iirc.
---
It gets fun in the 30s. You can tough it out until then.
---
A demon hunter is silently crying somewhere in Azeroth.
---
Yes, that's the idea. But they could leverage their sharding tech in the backend to make the merged seamless.
---
Go disc and have fun in pve and pvp
---
okay, I'm going to write something in swahili and if you dont understand it then you must support a swahili server option
---
Warriors will most likely be the most popular class, but mages will almost definitely be #2 overall (I think for alliance specifically paladins will be #2). Doesn't matter though, the point is you're right there will be a lot of mages running around.
---
The good news is you have the best ranged dps for dungeons and raids, incredible CC, and have the capability to be gods in any pvp situation. Just go Mage if you feel like it fits you. Personally I will be rolling Warlock because the playstyle suits me more.
---
The cap at 3k is artificial. It doesn't need to be there. Also the level 25 layering can be dynamic based on current pop. So some servers and times it may be 20 some 30. Bottom line as you get higher level it forces you into one layer.
---
I had a job from wotlk on that would take me away from the game for many months at a time, so I wasn't able to ever get geared enough to see every raid.  I remember saying to my friends that I wished there was some way I could just see the content myself without having to do the gear grind.  When LFR came out I was overjoyed; this was the exact answer to my problem!  
---
But it just...  wasn't the same.  It felt meaningless.  I'd log in after a several-months hiatus, do whatever new overland content there was for a day or two, hit whatever I hadn't yet seen in LFR, and then...  bleh.  The core element of the RPG genre, character progression, was essentially unnecessary for me once LFR was introduced.  And I had begged for it.  
---
I wasn't alone.  Lots of players were vocal and happy about LFR when it released. But, slowly, I watched my friends grow more and more casual.  My guild fell apart.  I think most guilds fell apart.  Players like me did this to the game.  It's our fault.  We're sorry.  Please make the game an MMORPG again.
---
I always used battle shout after I got buffed.  Not my fault I was the only one who benefitted.  Don’t hate the player, hate the game.
---
50 small layers, down to 25 bigger layers a few hours in, down to 8 even bigger layers by day 2, 4 OG pop sized layers by day 3. Numbers are off but that's the general idea.
---
Wrath had phasing not sharding.
---
Just delete your social media. It is cancer.
---
&gt;  subjective
---
Explain? We're talking about a system being used to counteract a massive influx of players by tapering them off into set groups fighting set respawn timers on set mobs in a set area. This will last for a set amount of time. Do you know what subjective means?
---
The pros are all very objective. Some of the perceived cons are the subjective part. "People will abuse layering to farm resources!!!! Pepega " - subjective. They probably will, but how many, to what extent, is that even close to being worth having dead servers if is the case? no.
---
Exactly. In our case all higher level players are on the same layer.
---
The strength of macros is that THE SAME key input can perform different actions depending on parameters. Using modifiers counter-acts that strength.
---
Don't get me wrong. Macros are great, when they make sense. Personally I think it's counter-productive to make macros with modifiers. Then functionally the macro is just multiple modifer keybinds in a more complicated way.
---
Example /cast [mod:shift]skill1; skill2 is a pointless macro. Because the same could have been done with 2 keybinds.
---
Yeah, I started like 10 years ago in a Vanilla private server, and, being an altholic, I ran Wailing Caverns a LOT of times, so I was deeply scared of running it with less than a full group.  
---
When first I played retail (end of MoP), I joined the wailing Caverns trough the finder (not as exciting as getting there, but I didn't like the barrens for leveling anymore) and two of our group leave just after the first mobs. I was a bout to say goodbye to requeue and the remaining warrior says: let's keep going. I was amazed to see him bulldozing through the mobs with relative ease (the healer was the other remaining player)we finished the dungeon fast, and not another word was spokken between us. I inspected the warrior: Full Heilroom Gear. This experience almost shatters Wow for me.
---
Does Growl count as an active? I don’t remember. It’s been so long since Vanilla and I’ve never been into Private servers.
---
What else do you want him to say? He can't remove or change them, but he clearly doesn't like their state in vanilla as evidenced by an answer to a question about them from another stream:
---
"Were world buffs designed to be used all at once? Yes, though we discovered that was kind of.. kind of a mistake. It was just too much, you know. People can't turn down even the slightest advantage when it comes to progressing through difficult content so it established this feeling that you had to have all the buffs before you could even start, and collecting all the buffs was just too much. It was too much work."
---
If you ignore 95% of the game and only talk about high end raiding sure
---
Who is going to afford or want to use a weapon like that then?
---
Yeah I don't really get it. 
---
Take the quest Milly's Harvest ([https://classicdb.ch/?quest=3904](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=3904)). You need 8 of those, and how many are simulatenously spawned on that little farm? 20? 30? Maybe 40 at the very most, but I doubt it.
---
So with no dynamic respawn, that's enough for max \~5-10 people doing the quest. Dynamic respawn remedies that, without notable interferrence with the game world. With layering there's still going to be competition, except the remedy (having players fade in and out of existence in front of you) completely kills immersion. 
---
The former is such an elegant solution compared to the latter IMO.
---
so i was questing in EPL on retail and i started a quest only to be ambushed by three troll rogues
---
if only there was some form of mandatory educational system which would teach kids how to speak English....
---
Ion is pretty well known to the retail community for his sweettalking and overpromising. "A few" weeks can easily be 6+, and other Blizz employees have also referred to layering being in the [_early months_](https://youtu.be/UHMd0KC3eTY?t=779). If you think "a few" weeks won't result in a few unlucky servers being layered all the way to phase 2, then I have a bridge to sell you. It'll be done in a few weeks, we promise.
---
Clique has nothing to do with healthbars.  All it is, is a way to manage actions with mouse-over + click.
---
What exactly was your video supposed to show? That people don't zone in when the zone is actually empty? Well done. Blizzard have already confirmed this happens between Barrens and Durotar, and hasn't got anything to do with layering.
---
That you THINK that every instance of objects appearing or disappearing has to do with layering isn't the same thing that it does. Because it happened also in Vanilla without layering.
---
It's hilarious how bad the design of modern WoW is when they can't even compete with RFC.
---
it's going to look the same with layering
---
The cap at 3k is artificial indeed, but what does that matter? They’ve stated they don’t want to make «mega-servers» as it wouldn’t be vanilla-like.
---
I hope you realize "EU servers" doesn't mean server language will be english. It means a clusterfuck of languages all over the place or some random language taking over because the majority of the server is for example german.
---
You need a better boyfriend.
---
The push back on language localisation is really expected on reddit tbh. Most of this site's users come from Anglophone and subsequently monolingual countries, they don't see the need for localisation. I read in another thread that blizz might have picked this route because of lack of EU testers during the stress tests, which would be unfair given the timezone differences.
---
K, bye
---
Back when people had enough class to appreciate a nice set of tits.
---
It's much harder but still possible. You have to blizzard earlier to account for the slow tick batching after the damage. It's just a lot more resets than normal.
---
It was used for the stress test
---
farm the shit out of mats with layer hopping, stockpile cheap mats that levelers dump on the AH etc and cash in 2 weeks later.
---
This would make sense. I hit 15 on server 3 pretty quickly, and that shit was straight up empty. I was hardly contested. I also got a late start because I was already level 5 on a server that got axed.
---
You agreed and disagreed with the OP at the same time.
---
Dozens of us. DOZENS!
---
You do know classic would be even more broken without it? Millions of players playing in the same area and doing the same quest. 
---
That wasn’t in classic.
---
If you have a massive overpopulation even at the high levels, then Blizzard can never turn off layering as promised.
---
That would be an even bigger problem.
---
LF random native language guild
---
I think the point is they handled content wrong past WOTLK.  Classic, BC, WOTLK were kind of like the beginning, middle and end of a story.  To me the expansions after those felt like forced sequels; "gee let's create this year's threat to all existence that everyone needs to head off to fight".
---
If they were going to rebuild the world, which they kind of did for Cata, I would have preferred to see a world of warcraft 2.  Let our heros who had grown to be god like heros retire and we could start up a new batch of characters in a familiar world from the same lore.  Maybe go back in time a bit and have us playing dark iron dwarves, booty bay pirates, gilneas, and dragonkin in a familiar (but different) world that incorporated all the good things they had learned from the first three expansions.
---
Their pockets were bursting with money; I would have preferred them to sink it into Wow 2 rather than the Cata revamp and project Titan (although good save on Blizzard's part salvaging Overwatch from that).
---
I’ll join ya! But I play Horde so I’ll just gank you as you’re about to zone in
---
What are some of those reasons? As long as you can clear the content, what is the downside of LFR?
---
For me, the mythic+ system gives no sense of completeness.
---
I really like being able to say " I killed Illadin!" and that meaning something. "I did this mythic key at level X"  doesn't mean much to me.
---
Layering is going to make many servers feel dead long before we get to the point where people are on dead servers itself.  There is no advantage to layering and it will damage the economy, the game play in both PvE and PvP, and it will damage the social aspect of the game by simply not allowing plutonic relationships form due to people who normally would have helped each other never even seeing each other.
---
This is literally Blizzard saying, "you think you don't want layering, but you do".  
---
The quest waits aren't usually that long after the first few hours of game as waves spread out.  It's not some doom and gloom situation.   And server hardware is far better than before, it can handle the load of bigger servers also extending the life of said servers. Not to mention, server mergers are very easy for blizzard to perform later.  It's not complicated at all as there are no competing factors outside of the PVP rank system.
---
Layering is bad, it's already showing massive signs of abuse and gameplay damage.  Several people in my PvP group are already discussing not returning due to it as people will use it to exploit away from PVP.
---
Unholy spec Kappa
---
Those are disadvantages for me. 
---
A single economy on a 20,000 or 100,000 person megaserver in which people are hopping around between little 3,000 person segments. What connection can anybody have to that economy? Will you become friends with the enchanter you met today when you and he log in to different layers  tomorrow? Will you go to Un'Goro to farm devilsaur leather the skinner from your dungeon group 
---
Flex players up and down means that new players you've never seen before have shifted into your reality. And that you probably won't see them again for a long time when they're flexed down. Also, it means that you no longer have slow times of the day/night to peacefully farm. In Vanilla I could log in before class and get a dungeon done with a few guildies who were online, PvP and raid in the evening on a bustling server, and then farm alone at 2AM for materials. It had a sense of truth to it since it reflected real peoples' schedules. I liked it. 
---
Guilds won't be cut off. It would be just like Vanilla, where you sign up where you want. 
---
Your list was three things. It did not go on and on.
---
Upvote because you're literally the only person (in this writing moment) that the question was directed towards Lmao
---
Good, bye.
---
Millions of people doesn’t play on the same realm.
---
What I imagine blizzard is trying to accomplish with layers is to stuff 3 or 4 server worth of players into a single server while avoiding login queues. It's this is the case then this won't help, as the number of players in the 20+ layer will exceed server cap and the dreaded queue will return.
---
As I mentioned Blizz needs to survive the first week or so. After that ppl will spread out. Some will play less some will stop.
---
I just really don’t want the main cities to be empty. That’s a huge part of connecting with your community.
---
Get good gear, download the add on that shows how many people are targeting you, profit.
---
TotalBiscuit was legit. He just loved good games. And that what WoW is, with the correct (classic) design.
---
There are no contested level 10 zones last I checked.
---
US has streamers
---
EU has..this
---
Oceania has shitty ping (prob'ly)
---
I see a pattern here
---
I remember everyone wanted to log on to their alts before the head was turned in to get a sweet leveling buff. Man that's gonna suck when you go through the effort and end up in a different layer.
---
right, except 95% of cases english takes over because most people are sensible enough to use an international language.
---
I'd look up Kargoz on youtube. Has a bunch of class duo leveling tips with warlock/priest being one of them. He considers them a tier 1 duo I believe.
---
Healing is also by far the hardest role, with the other two being largely a complete joke. Tanking pre wotlk was more difficult but it's also a joke these days.
---
i'm....conflicted. on the one hand i want to try classic again as i played wow back when it was about a month or two old. but at the time, i was deep in depression and so introverted i did not interact with anyone until the Burning Crusade. in vanilla, i kept to my self so much i didn't do almost any dungeons, and never did any raids. so going into it as i am, im really interested in what it is i truly missed.
---
on the other hand, i considered my 20s an absolute waste as all i did was play WoW, and i don't know if i want to go back into it or if i did i do not want it to be the time sink that it used to be. meaning i want to play, but i also don't want to sink hours upon hours into the game like i did as i still struggle just going out for anything social. hmm.
---
I pretty much had my heart set on playing a priest prior to the stress/beta test. After running some 5 mans it turns out I absolutely loathe staring at health bars. I couldn't imagine myself staring at 40 health bars. Gnome warlock it is then!
---
Don’t let the door hit you
---
you're confusing classic for vanilla. this isn't vanilla
---
No no. Wotlk were always a joke. Actually every wotlk content outside raids. World mobs were soft too.
---
That's the thing, it is imperative that Layering exist in the beginning.  It just shouldn't happen all willy nilly.  There needs to be a stricter form of jumping layers.
---
That's funny, I got my GF to duo with me and I'm going to be HER personal heal/buff bot
---
At first I am just going to go into it based on memory and pick whatever talents I want. In the long run I will look up what is actually good to use because I have no doubt the general community will have much higher expectations in group settings than they did back then. I'd rather not get myself ostracized in the newfound server community, but also want that semi-naive first go at it. I figure I can do a bit of both as long as I don't rain on anyone else's parade with my possibly terrible build and mostly stick to myself. I'll be doing warlock which was my main back in Vanilla &amp; TBC, but that I have not played much since then beyond usually getting to new levels caps on retail WoW.
---
There's a data centre in Sydney, so ping is fine for us :)
---
Honestly haven’t seen or heard a single retail player bash classic, at worst I’ve had friends say might not be for me I’ll try it but don’t think I’ll stick with it 
---
On the flip side classic “loyalist” do nothing but bash retail calling it worst thing to ever exist but personally I think it’s just the mainstream thing for the loud vocal minority to do just like when panderan were announced when it really wasn’t the end of the world and mop turned out to be a very good overall expansion.

Nah, EA ruined gaming in general. WoW completely ruined MMOs, though.

---
The fact that you can only see one side of the coin as subjective and the other objective does your argument no favors. In fact it only reinforces my point that they can be depending on the players bias and preference. One player seeing a starting area full of people can see that as a pro while another can see it as a con for a variety of reasons. Wether you agree or disagree with there reasons of there enjoyment isn't important.
---
Let's assume 1 million players want to try the game on day one .... At 3k pop and a 2k queue you would need 200 servers. That is insane. Imagine you have 2 mil ppl....400 servers?
---
There's an open beta coming up for NA
---
I think it should also be allowed near meeting stones. Or else trying to get 3 people together to have the Warlock summon would be an even hassle. Overall I agree though, only switching is rested XP areas is fairly smooth. Zoning in then zoning out to switch would work for some instances, but others like Maura, it's a trek from the meeting stones to the instance itself.
---
You guys are missing the point that they'll be duo leveling. Dot, want, throw a heal every couple of mobs. You hardly have to worry about maximum efficiency in a duo,  in the same way you do solo.
---
Jesus Christ...
---
Millions of people are going to be playing the game the day of launch. Vanilla took months before it even got to a million players. 
---
Stop crying about wanting a true vanilla experience but then also want hundreds of people doing the same quest you’re doing.
---
Easier than private servers? Absolutely.
---
and yet even after 10 years of English in school people still suck at it. Mostly because they don't need English outside of school - and actually learning a language happens mostly with exposure.
---
Your name was familiar. You were licking Blizzard's boots last fall when people were pointing out the flaws with the design of BfA. Do you still feel that you and they knew better than the players about those issues?
---
Layering is a solution that Blizzard is putting in the game because of the millions of retail wow subscribers who are getting access to the game for free. Many of them will check out the game for a few hours or even a few days just because they are curious, but few will actually stick around. These are what we call "tourists".
---
At the launch of vanilla, in order to play the game you had to actually purchase the game in advance. It was a much higher barrier of entry, and you can reasonably assume that a player going into WoW back then would stick around for a bit longer.
---
Layering allows Blizzard to inflate a server's population, normally at around 3k, to maybe say 12k across 4 "layers" instead. When the tourists quit, the idea is that the server's population will land at about 3k.
---
Without layering, each server would be maxed out at 3k for a few weeks, and then once the tourists quit, most servers would decline in population down to maybe 1k.
---
Yep just don't think it needs to be done by level. Should be done by the zone.
---
even 2Mpbs in enough (just the downloading takes ages)
---
They were never that difficult. It’s more about the time it takes to finish it, and also just not running in and pulling a bunch of mobs like retail.
---
This is a tad extreme. Calm and collected positive mental attitudes is what's going to get us through either helping Blizzard determine a better solution, or adapting to what the situation demands. Extreme and threatening-like statements dont help anyone, and instead create divides in the communities you claim you desire
---
Quite a bit of trust in "most people" - remember, private server handled it by enforcing english in public channels, Blizzard will not be able to do this. Next point, you can't really compare private server population to the sort of mainstream population classic will have.
---
I can ensure you, if you starting out on a server which has like 70% playerbase of one language, this language will take over completely.
---
For me, it doesn't really matter. I don't care enough to say "it ruined the game" or anything along those lines. Imo both Classic and Retail have things I love and enjoy doing. You'll see me playing both cz I genuinely enjoy both. Really hate this polarized view point alot of fans have, though I completely understand why it exist.
---
Might want to rethink that then.
---
Sure, but they'll have done the fight a bunch before and I'm sure they'll have all the pre 60 BiS gear. I'd bet though, if they tune up the difficulty enough to make up for the 1.12 talents, they'll need to spend some time collecting some of the 60 BiS first.
---
Just like they do in real life?
---
&gt;Locked to a layer unless I relog? Okay so now I just relog to hop layers? How is that a solution?
---
 I never said the solutions were perfect, but relogging stops people from layer jumping while fighting in PvP. Maybe they are band aid fixes, I never said anything else. I only replied to the retard claiming that not a single solution had been proposed, which is bullshit  
---
why are you acting as if nobody else has said that? I dont even want layering in starting zones, im all for 0 layering/sharding at all, but hey, that doesnt mean a plethora of options have not been discussed
---
Ich lachte.
---
And to me, Demon Hunter is the ultimate in pandering fan-service. When I saw it announced, I thought to myself "so this is how far they are willing to descend to keep people playing...".
---
There are no loading screens when you travel. Each continent is a unit. So it is layered as a unit. Can't layer a zone. Hence the clever solution via character level.
---
Release of a new server. I can't give you an answer for how you missed it?
---
I see a wow guide book. Are those things going to be useful again?
---
telling someone on r/classicwow that they haven't played wow lol
---
New server releases were exactly this.
---
Make sure to put your character on walk.
---
The vast majority of people who played Vanilla remember it being harder because it was harder prior to 1.12, you know, when the majority of people leveled.  There will, objectively, be a distinct difference in a fresh playerbase playing on 1.12 and playing on ~1.2-~1.8.  It's one of the things people will have to accept when it comes to Classic.
---
You would need 200-400 servers on launch to accommodate the rush.
---
While layering will still be there, its effects will be significantly reduced beyond the first couple of weeks, or at least I hope they will. 
---
Most people will be disposable strangers on Classic anyways since few will make it past level 20 or so.
---
They aren’t using the legion client though. They are using 8.1 the legion client was only used to build the demo... still very possible things get stuck or don’t get passed through.
---
Hell hunters can tame pets 2 levels higher than themselves. Something that didn’t happen until 7.3.5.
---
I rolled my frist character on Alleria EU, a gnome Warlock. Good times.
---
yes, dungeons were nerfed throughout 1.1-1.12 and players were made more poweful. everything will be very easy and quick
---
I'm struggling between Mage, Warlock, Priest and Druid.
---
Going Alliance and don't want to pick an over represented class, sort of cancels out the mage.  But at the same time a raid uses so many mages maybe it's okay.
---
Warlock is something I have almost no WoW experience with so thought I'd give it a go.  Am having second thoughts because of me getting older and recognizing that my pet micro won't be great.
---
Druid is a fringe pick, I like the idea of it but recognize it's pretty well gimped in all Pve scenarios end game.
---
Next to Paladin priest is my most played WoW class, I've also leveled one to 60 on a private server.  The class is good but I'm a bit of a lone wolf when it comes to grinding rep and things and doing so holy is a bit crap.
---
No way, how do you even dispose of that? And if you don't, you'll end up with complaints the following day along with municipal fines.
---
see you on august 26
---
I’ve played enough online games to witness that while you can communicate basic gaming information without much problem in writing form, the speaking proficiency among isn’t that great and doesn’t show a lot of nuance, humor and « poetry »
---
In the end, just try to understand the pleasure some people have to talk their first language instead of playing every online game in English. It’s something that Vanilla offered and classic won’t
---
That's odd, I seem to remember having focus in vanilla.
---
It definitely was. More complaining. Less friendly. Stingy with buffs. I still had a good time and met a fair amount of good people. But I definitely noticed the difference too, even had a convo with a guy about it in game.
---
Its launch day. Queues and seas of people ARE the game.
---
I never said you said such thing. You said that it was against the ToS to talk other languages on an english server and i said it wont matter because the realms wont be english.
---
You can use potions/elixirs/scrolls and they each apply a buff. Similar ones usually won't stack. (You can have a Str and an Agi one but not two different levels of Str)
---
Into low level resists. Frost, fire, shadow so if you get caught in PVP outside any time you can still resist. Plus there are spells the goblin and such still do. that you can avoid like the fire damage.
---
Couldn't care less, people speaking exclusively their native language will be the minority on the server and ostracised and excluded from the majority of players, they're only hurting themselves.
---
Now imagine starting out in that classic version of the game, and watching as over the years the game was turned in to what it is now.
---
Who are you referring to though? Is there a demographic that doesn't get their information through a source that isnt streamers? Do we really need those people? I doubt they hit 60...
---
Read the rest of the answers. I and other ppl have addressed you concerns.
---
You're going to have to face the fact that this isn't vanilla. Something like 80% of the people on your little Dragonmaw-6 are going to stop playing very quickly. That's just a fact. The relationships are going to take longer to form with that happening. We don't know the exact timing or extent, but the outsized dropoff is going to happen. Vanilla was growing from day one, classic will be shrinking. And even then we still had dead servers.  It's unfortunate, but that's the reality. Layering is the least transparent, most flexible way to deal with that disconnect from vanilla. That's not to say layering doesn't have problems that should be addressed.
---
Because this is a healthy attitude that will engender an inclusive community that is fun to join.
---
How did you beat equally geared druids in PVP? Just hope cooldowns like POM/trinkets were ready to go and place a well-timed counterspell/silence? I feel like they always had the upper hand with their abilities to shapeshift out of any root/polymorph
---
What about energy use? The cat doesn’t even have enough energy to use both those moves in a typical fight, I thought it was best to only use one of the two?
---
Lol release of a new server when? 
---
Release of a new server during Vanilla? You think that had more population than the release of the game? Haha
---
Expansions are inevitable.
---
I want all Europeans to learn English, so I vote for mixed servers.
---
I was just speaking with a friend about this, it seems like every time I get a shit pug I look at their server and it's Azralon or Ragnaros.
---
The difference being nobody is forcing you to play the game for that time. It's a fucking game you are choosing to play and you're losing your minds because for a couple of weeks a handful of people might slightly abuse a system to not get ganked? THAT is what you're so upset about? Holy shit the entitlement of the Classic crowd is insane. I am excited for the game to come out but my god I hope I never have to run into half of you people because you are just the saddest lot.
---
It happens constantly in almost any game with chat and a twitch viewership these days.
---
Any of the servers up or just a preload?
---
It is thought watch videos from beta
---
The 20+ will dynamically shit to 25+ and so on. Blizz just needs to survive the first week. After that some will stop playing some will play less. Ppl are taking time off work just to play the first week.
---
we did the whole quest line :P  
---
He was a little scary with three level 15s, but we got it first try. lots of avoided attacks/resists
---
"Which is a bigger number? Five, or one?"
---
&gt;The people saying #nochanges dont realize that there were in-fact DE and FR servers back in vanilla.
---
US servers were launched in 2004. [The EU servers didn't exist for a year, until 2005.](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/EU_English_realms_info) You sure you want to bark up the #nochanges tree?
---
And they wanted to do loot trading in dungeons..with possibly mixed language groups. The incentive is higher to "help" your friend here. Or another example right klick report the language minority out of the general chat.
---
Just make it so that everyone gets kills when tagging mobs. Looting items insta respawn and so on. 
---
Fuck layering
---
Hard to believe you got a PHd when you're incapable of arguing a point. 
---
I did a lot or my raiding during my studies, sorry to break your facade here bro, but I guarantee I likely have less playtime than you, considering I pretty much just played to raid and the occasional arena stint with friends.
---
I played rogue then, pretty sure I'm doing it again. 90% on that. The differences, I'll be going in with the expectation I will take at least one alt to level 35, which will mean a lot less profession switching. 
---
I intend to get a little more wild with specs. I really only played hemo swords, sub dagger, combat raid sword. I only played about one week with mace combat cold blood pvp. Sure it was missing a lot of good elements, but cold blood blade flurry eviscerate double kills were super satisfying. Blade flurry in general was fun in PvP because the armor of your secondary target had zero effect until the pre-TBC patch, so you could kill a clothie and a warrior together. I want to run a lot more niche builds that generally aren't considered good, even by myself, and test them fully to see what they're worth. Switch things up for my continued enjoyment.
---
I also want to get exalted with Ravenholdt to be more RP. I didn't get exalted on my first rogue until late TBC.
---
Clearly none of you were on at the end of the stress test when they collapsed layers. The game would be unplayable.
---
Which is exactly my point, if you don’t force them to actually use it they’re never going to bother to learn it. It’s an evil circle.
---
Thanks for really getting to the root of the problem with your own understanding of the situation. Even with layering, starting areas weren't just "full" they were unplayable. Not just starting areas, but basically everything 1-10 was being camped, leading to people coming up with insane ideas like exploration EXP. Explo EXP started as a really dumb concept that is quickly becoming more accepted because of just how unplayable 1-10 was on the tests. 
---
You can keep attacking me personally if you think it will help, but layering is going in with classic launch, hopefully aggressively so, so it will have the impact needed to make the game playable. The objective is to make the game playable for the masses, and that trumps the minority who think "risking dead servers is #worth fam".
---
So a chance of a possible problem or 200-400 servers on launch day to accommodate 1-2 million players?
---
It's a feature!
---
Yeah that's also true. For example I played way to much in vanilla then stopped with BC but still got to see a fair amount of BC and wotlk because I could hop on friends characters. However after that there was just nothing that would have still hold me into the game at all because I just had spent to much time in it so I quit gaming that much in general not just wow. I think blizzard realized or feared exactly that so people could keep playing more casually.
---
However turns out that this iteration of wow also sucks so people could still play it but don't want to. 
---
So now classic comes and I'm ready to put time into again. I was wow ready again before no actually but when I tried the game (wod/legion release) it just wasn't the game I wanted to play anymore.
---
it doesn't though. it happens once in a while but that's to be expected. world of warcraft doesn't even have a big twitch following. the metrics show that classic will house players mostly between the ages 24 and 34. it wasn't a thing in the past stress tests or in the ongoing beta. 
---
the more twitch-hate I read on this sub the more I realize the people who oppose twitch culture are generally incredibly ignorant people, especially when it comes to modern gaming and the crossover from twitch
---
I feel like our opinions differ, which is okay. But to me, if the only reason for using sharding the first 20 levels is to survive the first week, them why not use layering instead, that way you’ll avoid what I believe will be overcrowded or queued servers for those 20+.
---
Having played vanilla had 0% influence On beta and stress test invites
---
They had 111 servers in EU during Vanilla.
---
&gt;  of ONE server each 
---
You mean 3-4 servers. PvP, PvE, RP and maybe RPPVP.
---
Serious guilds take a healing priest spec'ed to shadow weaving instead of a full SP.  Once you MB + mindflay up to 5 stacks, you only need to mindblast within 15 seconds to prevent the debuff from falling off.
---
Shadow has mana problems, which makes it less than ideal for a raid DPS slot.
---
Personally, I love priest, and I love healing in pve and I love shadow in pvp.  **But**, I don't want to deal with weekly respec costs in the 100's of gold, or the difficulty with which I will have itemizing shadow because raid dps gear will go to dps and healing gear is not the best for shadow pvp.
---
Nun müsste man nur noch Leute von der Hordenseite wiederfinden ;)
---
You do realize that the intent of them even having layering enabled on the beta at all is to exercise the tech as they continue to develop the game, not give you a rich gameplay experience, right? 
---
Concurrency on beta doesn't seem to be high, and they probably \*could\* disable it all together and things would feel  better (and it would certainly curb the "bUt LaYErIng BlIzZarD WhYY???" bullshit), but instead they seem to be doing the responsible but unpopular thing and keeping it running in order to help to expose integration and regression risks as they implement bug fixes or other new changes (many of which we almost certainly never directly see).   
---
Or maybe they just want to ruin your gameplay experience, in particular?
---
Shadow is kinda bad to level as until around 40. Don't mis lead people.
---
Sharding? No. Layering? Yes.
---
My priest saw about everything there is but naxx in vanilla.
---
Not enough variation for me just to try shadow so this time im rolling a whole other class.
---
Obligatory Danskjävel comment. 
---
Nice write-up, bud.
---
Australia: Hold my [Melon Juice]
---
Yea, but layering is a fact, and 3 weeks is better than 3 months.
---
I want to say you could have like 18 or something stupid like that without worrying about heals or class abilities pushing things off. It was significant, but also annoying. If you really wanted to be the very best you could drop 200g+ on a single wipe. Honestly, I'll probably get by as long as I can just using elixir of the mongoose.
---
Later dude.
---
Ho , you're so smart . . 
---
But i will respond seriously . there's roughly 150 millions people speaking swahili in the world . So if there's enough player to fill some server , why not ???
---
&gt; world of warcraft doesn't even have a big twitch following.  
---
It doesn't? This sub doesn't seem to shut up about it and any time Asmon snaps his fingers he floods a server.
---
Viewership was passing 100k for classic alone and before that it was getting \~20k easily on the regular.
---
On day 1? Or after a year of gradual growth and retention?
---
Loved your story about the great time you had in RFC.  Current retail is like watching TV.  Classic/Vanilla is like having an adventure.
---
I'd prefer the way OP says as this is what I thought layering was for initially. I seem to remember them saying sharding/layering would be in for the starter zones which I was cool with. 1-10(15-20) is enough of a period to spread people out and be good with it. Plus once you get people invested in a few hours they are much less likely to leave/log off, where as if you are level 1 and you can't tag a kobold to save your life you will probably just say fuck it.  In the higher zones you have the option to do more quests or kill different monsters or even go to different zones.
---
For another solution would it not be possible to just introduce a cooldown/grace period for swapping layers?
---
Keep the automated layering to restructure the population like they intend it but simply add a cooldown for a person to manually swap layers if they are in combat, something like 5 minutes. With anything. Person or monster. That should kill most of the problems people have with farming rares, running from world pvp and whatnot.
---
Perhaps even introduce an actual cooldown on layer hopping manually. 30 or 60 minutes. This might be annoying to players if they need to link up with their main raid/group at some point and they forgot they layer swapped 20 minutes ago though. I believe a combat timer would be a nice bandaid fix however.
---
Oppose it all you want, I guess. Enjoy wasting your time.
---
You're not important.
---
German people are usually able to speak english. French less so but should still be fine. It would be risky to set up language based servers as they might die really early.
---
Then so be it, I'd rather have layering than dead servers or full/queued ones.
---
&gt;Thanks for really getting to the root of the problem with your own understanding of the situation. Even with layering, starting areas weren't just "full" they were unplayable. Not just starting areas, but basically everything 1-10 was being camped, leading to people coming up with insane ideas like exploration EXP. Explo EXP started as a really dumb concept that is quickly becoming more accepted because of just how unplayable 1-10 was on the tests. 
---
 Again. Your opinion on wether or not that type of play style is enjoyable or not is irrelevant. It does not automatically become objective because you prefer to play a certain way.
---
&gt;You can keep attacking me personally if you think it will help, but layering is going in with classic launch, hopefully aggressively so, so it will have the impact needed to make the game playable. The objective is to make the game playable for the masses, and that trumps the minority who think "risking dead servers is #worth fam".
---
At least you used objective in a context that is correct so you have one of the definitions down.  Only time will tell with the latter.
---
Super curious if you were alliance of horde? I’m assuming alliance because of the asmon layer thing. 
---
On horde side I played priest and buffed every person i saw which was a lot in first few levels. It was 95% of the time returned with a buff back or a whisper saying thank you. I felt so great about it I texted my brother and nephew who are playing classic with me in August.
---
No. Only for streamers and people on the F&amp;F list.
---
Us normies with no connections are fucked.
---
So is being oom... Have you ever played a lock?
---
in comparison to games with historically large viewership? absolutely not. world of warcraft classic is popular on twitch right now. it's really just a phase, they come and go.   
---
at 100k viewers it doesn't even compare to other games
---
Now this is beta testing.
---
Now knowing that you are from the US, makes your arguments/opinion understandable. You do not know what it is like in Europe, when it comes to different culture and language barriers. And don't forget, the first borders only opened about 25 years ago. I still remember needing to go through border checks when leaving Germany. Cultures do not change that quickly.
---
This does not mean that we do not also have our share of entitled people.  ;)
---
Anyways, I had to look up most of the facts I posted in my last reply. When you have more time and feel like talking about this a bit more, then just reply whenever.  :)
---
Btw.: I also put in for vacation a few weeks after launch ... I'll be no-lifing classic with a buddy for the whole week  :D
---
Imagine thinking private servers will have much of any population when classic actually launches. Imagine thinking your opinion matters so much you can think that's a valid threat. 
---
"if layering goes live, people are just gonna go back to all them private servers" my sides dude.
---
&gt;Lol release of a new server when? 
---
&gt;Release of a new server during Vanilla? You think that had more population than the release of the game? Haha
---
&gt;Nothing can compare to classic release date of millions logging in at the same time. Stop trying.
---
You asked if it happened and I gave you an answer when it did. I can't help you if you dislike the answer given.
---
Mate, we're all supportive of you coming out this late in life, but for this sort of talk you're better off using the [appropriate twink subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/twinks/)
---
These communities are far too small relative to people who play speaking English. The only one that would have a chance would be Germans, based on some (untrustworthy and innacurate) statistics taht got posted players on German retail servers comprised 20% of EU population. Even if that entire 20% went to 2 servers (assuming half will go PVP and half go PVE) there won't be nearly enough to take over the entire server considering how few servers are estimated for classic anyway.
---
Well it could just put you in the same dungeon instance even from different layers, if grouped. So like the game knows your group just opened BRD #43565, anyone in that same group going into that entrance goes to that number. When you are exited, it could just put you back in a layer together.
---
People could use this just like an inn to gather on the same layer. It's not really exploitable, I'd act like another rested area.
---
&gt; an inclusive community that is fun to join.
---
Speak for yourself. I don't think I've ever joined such a community and had fun.
---
Pretty astute observations. I hadn't really considered the Germany being that high a percentage and not warranting their own realm. So East and West coast may just get 1 pve and 1 pvp? I would cry
---
She's also over triple his age
---
I have no idea what you're talking about, 100k concurrent viewers is absolutely massive and most games never touch that mark.
---
I dont know, I find mythic plus dungeons to be very fun.  But the big issue with retail is that damage can be incredibly spikey, it can happen fast, and the heals are big and can happen fast too.  So instead of the more deliberate action in classic, you get the frenetic pacing of retail.
---
Like the parent comment said, you can have an intense 3 pull, but it's not like anyone is getting chunked for 30% of their HP in one hit.  Content is more of a marathon, and you have to play better and manage the fights better to come out ahead of challenging situations, like rooting/slowing and kiting, balancing polymorphs, cycling fears and curse of recklessness to avoid pulling more, sap before pull, seduce before pull, etc.
---
In retail, you are basically spamming your heals as best you can, and the DPS are pressing their buttons as best they can, and virtually no one plays smarter because everything happens at such a wild pace that you don't have the bandwidth to *be* deliberate.
---
They've already said that there will be queues because the server won't be able to hold every player once layering "ends".
---
This clip comes from [World of Roguecraft Episode 2](https://youtu.be/cUVNOI9rI5U?t=1224)
---
Because I was looking for a right answer.
---
Both skills used at once would be 60 (35 for bite, 25 for claw) so if you leave both on auto. Basically they would probably bite once and the remaining only claw. That being said. After realizing this, I would agree having both is a waste and the points are better off placed elsewhere.
---
My lord what a sperg. Wanting to actually be able to play is not an "objective style of play" 
---
"Being able to actually play the game is just like your opinion REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE its not objective because some people prefer to literally not be able to play the game"
---
Imagine holding this view and trying to defend it.
---
Have fun farming the mace in Gnomer. :|
---
&gt;Imagine thinking private servers will have much of any population when classic actually launches. Imagine thinking your opinion matters so much you can think that's a valid threat. 
---
&gt;"if layering goes live, people are just gonna go back to all them private servers" my sides dude.
---
Ouch I must of struck a nerve if you are going back through my old posts. Don't go complete stalker or you might get bored with my veterinary subreddits.
---
To be more precise it is an *Animated GIF*
---
If you wish to play an MMO without socialising, perhaps [World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/) might be the right game for you
---
People need something to complain about otherwise they’re life will be meaningless until classic releases. They need to fill the void in their lives somehow
---
Vanilla wow was never particularly difficult, in most ways the mechanics of the current raids are far more difficult than any vanilla wow boss, but the base level of effort required by the player is much higher in vanilla than modern wow. In BFA you have no real incentive to do anything, mythic raid gear is only marginally better than daily quest rewards. 
---
The majority of content is theme park style, you get to see all of the content and there is no way that you can fail. LFR and battlefronts being the worst offenders. 
---
The varying difficulties of the same content is also a terrible game design because it's repetitive and inverts the normal flow of RPG progression. Normally in an RPG you start out weak, and become stronger over time, to the point that certain content becomes easy because of the time that you've put into your character. In modern WoW, you are allowed to rampage through content and clear the 'entire game' in a few hours, then if you want to keep playing you have the option of essentially making your character weaker through increased difficulty to add challenge back into the game. It's antithetical to RPG design.
---
\-  because of lack of EU testers during the stress tests
---
May be a stupid question, may be that they are just testing all sorts of things, but... why are cities being layered? It's supposed to relieve overpopulation and allow people to quest and grind without as much competition, which isn't happening anyway in the cities? They have no mobs, resources, etc afaik.
---
Your whole idea on how statistics works is incredibly wrong.
---
And they get to tank some fights too.
---
sorry, but you have no idea what you're talking about. there are 7 games on twitch that on average have more than 100k viewers. if you look right now you'll see league of legends at 214k, fortnite at 132k, dota 2 and counter strike at 125k, gta5 at 110k and whatever teamfight tactics is at 109k. even rocket league and minecraft at 75k and 60k respectively are larger than wow at barely 40k now.   
---
competitive games easily get 600k during tournament seasons
---
Healing in raids isn't that bad. You aren't responsible for all 40 people. Usually healers are given groups or a certain Tank to heal. So you could potentially just be a main tank healer and heal almost only the Main tank.
---
They would have to solve a weird situation of crossing back and forth at the layer line, seeing people PVP right at the edge and appearing / disappearing. They could probably find a way, but if it's going to take too long then they should do the rested area idea. They could probably put that in faster.
---
It's not that they can't speak english, they want to be able to speak their own langage. You will see things like "lfm stratholme fr only", all of the chats will be in foreign langages and non speakers will be excluded.
---
And no it's not risky at all, you can safely have multiple servers of the main languages (french/ger) and be sure that they won't die, so 1 is the minimum.
---
Not sure if you even read the OP, but this thread is not about removing layering entirely.
---
Haha, i played hakkar too it was basically ita?? When you joined group and then u got kicked..
---
A year?  3 months (nov 2004 -&gt; jan 2005) is a year now?
---
You have like 50+ posts crying HARD about layering, maybe you shouldn't use the phrase "struck a nerve." The projection is hilarious man, I hope you keep responding. 
---
Layering will be in classic. :) Aug 27th, mark your calendar
---
0.5/10
---
Lmao underrated comment right here, and big true
---
Did you not read the OP? This thread is not about removing layering entirely.
---
 "Best of all, I met so many players grouping up for quests, questing and dungeons. I probably had more player interaction in one hour of classic than in more than two years of playing current WoW."
---
Welcome to the world, my friend.
---
Best lore? What the fuck is wrong with you?
---
Username doesn’t check out
---
Mom IS pot in this scenario
---
At some point though they would need to disable or relax the constraints of the layering to see how congested areas get and what's would be a reasonable amount. Can't just hope on launch day to have it at one extreme or another without testing the in between spectrum for optimum performance.
---
Recklessness.  You can use a lvl 1 for low mana cost, and then overwrite it with a different curse to cause him to come back to you.
---
You can also pop it on humanoids right before 20% hp to prevent them from running away in fear.
---
Man I can't wait to play a warlock.

After a couple of years. At least Blizzard got the information this time, hopefully they’ll be prepared on launch with plenty (100+) of realms globally.

Even then I'd still restrict it to starter zones.  There is no need for it after that besides the exploits that have clearly seen.

How does layering correlate to farming MC?
---
No one ran back though, not when you have a shaman self res or soulstones to get a healer up, and get the raid resurrection going.
---
No they're not LMAO....

The french and german communities are  as big as the british community in EU, english servers are that big only because all the eastern, nordic and other small countries play in them. ..

No, what he's telling you is that the client switched targets for a brief second with these macros, causing you to lose your combo points. On the Classic beta, you do not lose combo points with mouseover macros.
---
Why does this elf look like Chris Cornell
---
Yeah.  Just shows how little gamers know what they really want.
---
I would love to see a screenshot without no layering at all. Just to see how many people are actually playing the fucking game
---
Some of the first slavetraders where Black and from africa, no?
---
Forgive me if im wrong.
---
&gt;You have like 50+ posts crying HARD about layering, maybe you shouldn't use the phrase "struck a nerve." The projection is hilarious man, I hope you keep responding. 
---
&gt;Layering will be in classic. :) Aug 27th, mark your calendar
---
August 26th if your american. I will give you some time to cool off, I have work I should focus on anyways. A word of advice though, people grow from constructive criticism. Acting obtuse won't get you anywhere.
---
You forgot Aus servers.
---
Yes it’s a different language
---
Accurate
---
I'm going to drop some bombs.  Nothing has been discovered since Vanilla that will change how most classes were played by people who were raiding AQ40/Naxx.  So there are a few videos of clickers and keyboard turning in Vanilla, cool.  PvE is easy and was more about carrying others.  There are people who raided Naxx who did this, there are people now who do this.  But!  A good chunk of people knew how to keybind and make macros.  Lets get away from this fantasy that no one understand such things back in Vanilla.
---
I'll play a tank and raid lead just like I did in Vanilla, the same way I did in Vanilla, because it was fun.
---
It was offered years ago so and it was a good idea so it shouldn't be hard to understand people are pissed it won't be a thing anymore. 
---
And for some reason people like you are pissed about it when it's clearly not something you give a fuck about.
---
Each layer has as many people in it as vanilla would have had online for any given server. 
---
Layers don’t spill over like you said, one layer doesn’t fill up to 100/100 and then the next one has 1/100. First layer goes to 150/100 then splits into to 75/100 layers. 
---
No dead layers. No dead servers like you ask for. 
---
AND ITS A TEMPORARY SOLUTION!!! you have no other way to do it without killing the community. 
---
Congrats, you played yourself
---
Well that goes without saying but to me healing is painstakingly dull. Then again the meta at level 15 (coupled with the lack of spells) didn't help.
---
I would love to see a screenshot of a server with no layer at all. Just to see how many people are actually playing the fucking game
---
Will this end or will I have to dissect every fact about twitch?
---
That's a very tiny number of games compared to the number played out there. It's a 1% minority. Any game that reaches that point is going to have its user base inflated and influenced by the twitch community. It happens every, single, time.
---
And they don't need to get that high to see effects. Rainbow 6 rarely gets huge viewership but I see twitch memes getting spammed in there plenty often.
---
Ahhh, the old, “it’s just the beta. They’ll have it fixed by launch” routine.
---
Please tell me the difference between sharding and layering the first 20 levels, I genuinely do not see it.
---
Do you not have a copy without a background, or with an alpha layer instead?  Those would be more beneficial.
---
Just ordered my canvas of this as well can't wait!!!
---
&gt; dk what took over this community
---
Probably something to do with it gaining 100k subscribers, tripling in size, since Blizzcon.
---
Just put a timer on it.  You join a group on another layer, it pops up a timer like rez does and you can switch layers in x minutes.
---
It should be 10-30 seconds in non-contested zones, and 3-5 minutes in contested zones or longer.
---
Make me a mod and I'll post the next trilogy of the Office wow mashups.
---
Meet the Feebles says, "Hold my beer."
---
It's just such a horrible downgrade to go from sharding 1-10, MAYBE 1-20, to 1-60 layered...1-20 is like 10% of the leveling process, I would've been fine with some side effects of sharding as long as i can get out quickly. At 20 you also have the option to do dungeons if people are killing your boars. 
---
Theres the argument that "it's temporary." It could be 2 weeks, but it could also be 2-3 months. The only real certainty we have from Blizzard is that it will only be a Phase 1 mechanic... though Phase 2, with Dire Maul and the Honor system, doesn't need to arrive until 3 or so months in.
---
Even if you want to take your time and smell the roses along the way, 3 months is virtually all of your 1-60 time. So, yes, we have a temporary problem that could last the entirety of your leveling journey.
---
I just hope we get some kind of word from Blizzard, whether they plan to strengthen layering's weak points, neuter it to a shard-layer hybrid system for levels 1-10 to 1-30, or *do nothing*, it would be good to get a blurb of feedback on this.
---
Not necessarily. Sea of people works if mobs are spawning faster, which is not Blizzlike of course. Queues can be prevented with layering.
---
The notion is to be a part of an omnipresent opposition to this. Blizzard might catch wind of that and reconsider doing this to Classic. I think it's worth a bit of time. Plus, typing and thinking practice.
---
Attunements ironically were such a great time gate. It actually involved doing something in the game rather than just waiting X days for whatever raid to open up.
---

Going gnome mage again. It's by far my favorite combination and can't wait to experience it again. Rolling some alts will come later for free time, but it will always be my main.
---
That's probably the reason why we're here.    
---
There isn't any rule book or guide to follow in terms of creating WoW.  
---
Every developer has their own idea of what they think is a good MMORPG and what they should focus on.    
---
Even the player base is split on what they think Classic WoW "should be".
---
It sucks but it forces you to talk and think and work out your problems for yourself.  Thats what classic gaming is about.  Its about the struggle to succeed.
---
IF it doesn't bother you then you're a fucking idiot.
---
oyster clams and cockleeeess!
---
this could be abusable  for nodes / herbs in places like mara and both DM's though. I think Inn's are the safest and best way. You really don't want to make switching layers accessible in the open world
---
I understand that some want to communicate in their mother tongue. I just think it's in their own best interest to do it in English instead.
---
these modifiers are something that was probably hard coded and it in the database files.  they reverted a lot of the combat code to 1.12 and probably missed this.
---
The mouse over blind macros in vanilla targeted someone, cast it, then Target the previous target. It worked, but it causes you to lose your combo points from the first target.
---
Oh god, world war 2 in world of Warcraft
---
I like the name of the dwarf. Arcanite Reaper Hooooo!
---
Of course there will be a large opposition, players are dumb. They fail to see the forest for the trees in 99% of situations.
---
Its not really worth it for speed leveling. I do plan to run a lot of dungeons on my warrior, though, because I find it the most fun way to level and you also end up with better gear for when you do quest or grind.
---
Well you’re new to the internet.
---
Not a singular example.

Husband got all excited over the stress test and we rolled some newbie gnomes on retail to tide him over until release once the stress test was done (I already play retail). He spent all night chatting with a friend from vanilla who got super excited to see him online again (he hasn't played since Cata). It was adorable to watch his bromance. I love how classic is helping people reconnect :)
---
Its usually the pvp streamers that become popular since you can learn from them and its sick to see them fuck up people. Asmongold is just a boring pve player who gets carried in everything and then does tmog contests where his judgement is actually retarded
---
Last thing I remember was dancing in needles flats with two people I had never met before servers shut down. If you guys read this, Viscera hopes to see y'all at launch!
---
cool. So you can't switch layers at *all* to farm devilsaur and rich thorium. Sounds like a happy accident
---
Blizz is amazing, forcing insane shit down our throats so that we can "settle down" with crossrealm in VANILLA.  Its still crossrealm even if u go to the inn.
---
For Real? They buffed rouges like that? Damn. That’s gonna be ruthless in pvp.
---
It wont be a major problem, if it is you might unfortunately change your realm. It would have been nice to have different realms but its not the end of the world.
---
I like you
---
Actually checking his post history, no he wasn't. You out here making up bullshit accusations and being upvoted for it?
---
I did also post on the official forums and made a bug report in the game.
---
we can end it if you want, there isn't much of an argument here to be had.  
---
you're correct about very few games making it to even 10k viewers -- but the argument is inconsequential to what we're talking about. it has nothing to do with it.  
---
&gt; Any game that reaches that point is going to have its user base inflated and influenced by the twitch community 
---
sure. the question is to what degree. we're not seeing this "twitch culture overhaul" we read about on the sub. it's just not there. as it turns out, what people do in twitch chat stays pretty much in twitch chat. sure, a small minority of people will take that stupid shit to games. it's to be expected. but is it as bad as you're making it out to be? no.   
---
you should know better than to use anecdotes
---
You don't,  it is playable out of the box, but a lot of people don't like the look of it, that's where custom UIs come in
---
There could certainly be spawn-hunting and pvp evading, but for one, that isn't as important sub 20, and for two, at least it would only be for 10% of the game, not 100% from levels 1-60.
---
Also, it could be like this: 5 layers. levels 1-20 get split into all 5 layers, A, B, C, D, E. Layer A would be the designated +20 layer, and you would still have one layer (or shard even) thats populated with low levels. There probably is an even better solution, but so far, I'd much rather that than just flatly layering the whole world for 2 weeks to 2 months.
---
Why would a level 20 be in the starting tutorial towns anyways?
---
It doesn't have to be a fact with so many people against it.
---
World pvp is lame. Its not challenging to get corpse camped by 3 rogues 10 levels higher than you. 
---
And it certainly doesn't make the game more rewarding
---
I have an alt called Knight Rider
---
Whats your worry? They are identifying these things and fixing them? Theres still 2 months of beta so far and things are progressing. I don't understand why you would wonder if it was a bad idea or not.
---
How is it that when we find and address bugs people get even more angry than otherwise? How is identifying and fixing this stuff not great news?
---
No.. its not cross-realm. What are you even talking about?
---
You def want spirit tap in your first 10 talent points. Anything else is honestly ignorant.
---
&gt; Something like 80% of the people on your little Dragonmaw-6 are going to stop playing very quickly. That's just a fact. The relationships are going to take longer to form with that happening.
---
I don't see a major philosophical issue here because the people leveling at your pace will be present with you through the 30s, 40s, 50s, and at 60 so you'll have a chance to get to know them when you see them day after day. Just because some will quit doesn't mean that some won't. With layering they just aren't around tomorrow. Or the next day. They're gone, because you're on a 20,000-100,000 person megaserver of strangers. Maybe you'll see them again on the same layer in a week and perhaps you'll even remember them. So the choice is between smaller Segments that might or might not have enough population leave to warrant a merge vs. sharding, where every stranger remains a stranger. New strangers are here today and new strangers will be there tomorrow when today's strangers are gone.
---
We all know you will be, regardless whether layering will be there or not ;)
---
Yea that can def do it. Healing can be really fun, i wouldn't throw it out the window just because of that one experience. This is coming from someone who used to tank and dps main then switched to healer and never went back. Tanking and dps is fun but nothing beats being the healer and saving people from mistakes knowing you're the only reason the boss was taken down.
---
2.3 had deadzone removed- there is no mention of the attack range changes based around movement. IDK about the tauren ranges, but that's not what this conversation is about
---
You should know better to assume that all twitch viewers are going to get into a *closed beta test*.
---
Don’t provide false hope
---
This post convinced me to get hyped for classic. 
---
Thanks.
---
How do u have 1 post in 4 years with a username like that
---
I think we both got carried away. I DO agree with the original OP. Layering is needed for early levels and ideally would be restricted to starting zones but from what I understand how layering works it is not possible. OP suggested to "lock" characters past a certain level to the same layer. I AGREE. 
---
All I was suggesting that with all other options on the table this is the least painless one and could potentially backfire on few servers. All other options are much more dangerous and may have worse problems.
---
I just instantly removed 10 channels, like damn I didn't know there were so many spergs
---
Eh saying they use the cloud isn't exactly accurate. It's not like they're renting servers from Amazon or anything, but it is true that the server architecture that Blizz uses nowadays is the same basic format as a cloud server. Without getting into too much detail, it's why your ping in New York, Dallas, LA and what have you are all fairly similar to each other even though the servers are all in California; using nodes like that makes the servers more stable when lots of people get on at once and makes it so your ping to the individual node is what matters, making for generally better latency for players.
---
Leeway is a Vanilla mechanic though.
---
Yes, Social Services its this post right here
---
Blizzard is also thinking that a *vast majority* of the launch wave is going to be BFA players, or maybe curious newcomers, what Blizz themselves call "the tourists". 
---
IF they are right, and 80% of people won't even make it to level 20 (which can take up to 1 whole day played time), then you have that 20% that remains with level 20+ toons, a post level 20 population of 4000. And then they can use server queues as a minor supplement to keep the population controlled.
---
What blizzard has said about this is that layering is either on or it’s not on. It can’t be partially applied to the world.
---
Removed as low effort.
---
Not that I care... But some players will be 60 in 4 days. 2 weeks or 1 month of exploiting layering is a hell of alot of time for neckbeards.
---
You can't talk your way into making mobs spawn faster mate. You'll just have to find a reliable spawn place and spam your keys for 3 minutes hoping the RNG gods gives you the tag. And if your ping sucks then it's just completely impossible to get a tag on anything.
---
Yeah it was basically just me alone in the barrens from 11 to 15 on Server 3.
---
How deep?
---
Much more lazy then just doing nothing and allowing 2 hour long queues into each server with insane overcrowding :)
---
good thing I didn't.  
---
probably okay to assume that a large portion of the people following asmongold around in stress tests also watch his stream. probably
---
Yes, but if everyone is in Elwynn forest that diesnt matter. Stop being such a smooth brain
---
100+??? you mean 200-400 realms..... imagine that would be insane. 
---
imagine 50% of the initial rush leaves the game .... so now you have deserted servers. There is not server transfer mechanic..... 
---
Unless someone has a better solution Layering is the only way.
---
Ok with some classes it makes sense
---
This I do strongly agree with. I dislike simply hiding extra abilities under modifiers.
---
Here's a trick: you can actually multiply your character limit by using keybinds instead of modifiers in the macro, then put macros on those new keybinds. With sufficient #show and #showtooltip, you lose 0 functionality, but can write macros up to 1000 characters (technically longer, since you save writing a lot of [mod:whatever]).
---
When you have that much space, you can start to do really interesting /target commands, or raid/party dependent controls. I don't even know how I would fill that much space, but I'm getting pretty eager to try.
---
They even predicted all of you who framed a map on their wall.
---
That and having to abandon a party just to make a trade with someone on a diff layer.
---
Looked like there was down time to me. He just stood instead of sitting.
---
LOL have to disagree there. They will have huge support and alch/ench in house. Funnel gear and buy BoE purps for the tank and everyone else will have quest greens. I would be very surprised if no one gets a week one rag kill
---
&gt; we're not seeing this "twitch culture overhaul" we read about on the sub. it's just not there. 
---
&gt; You should know better than to assume that all twitch viewers are going to get into a *closed beta test*. 
---
&gt; good thing I didn't. 
---
You're just wasting my time.
---
First it started as "just sharding for the starting zones." Then it's "just layering for 2 weeks." Then it lasts 3 months, and they never lied because "we said it would absolutely be gone by phase 2," which would logically come out 3 months after launch.
---
If as many people drop off after the first week as they think, than I'll be relieved. But if they try to sandwich a 20k population of layers into one server and expect that to be near 3k in 2 weeks? Blizzard has been off base before.
---
Cool, can I have your stuff?
---
I think you're better off having at least a chance to get to know the people who will be on your final server vs. planned server mergers that only solve the name issue. I  think you are overestimating the amount of people who will even make it to 30 on an OG pop size realm. Much less than back in the day.
---
The gnome starting zone is impossible with 20 people. That quest where you need to loot an item off the ground has a long respawn and everyone has to loot it.
---
Haha! That was pretty close to the old common strat but often it was a rogue on Whitemane to just keep her interrupted. I love that people are relearning these fights. I'm looking forward to learning new things from new players and sharing knowledge from the old days as well.
---
Honestly I really like playing support and hybrid classes, so the fact they don’t have a real niche in WoW is disappointing to me sometimes. I’m aiming to play Balance or Enhancement and I realize those specs suck but it hurts that no one values their utility (Innervate/Moonkin Aura/Battle Rez)(Totems/Stormstrike) or offhealing/offtanking and everything is just about dps and big numbers.
---
&gt; This much effort for a problem that doesn’t exist
---
Discussing how to make layering better is fine, and the OP even admits it is needed, but wtf are you on about with a "problem that doesn't exist." 
---
There will absolutely be a rush of players on the servers. That rush is so substantial it will make progressing at all almost impossible, and a horrible experience. There will absolutely be a huge dropoff of players, which if there were a hundred servers as opposed to layers, would result in tons of dead servers. Layering is what is called "learning from history", and it fixes all of these actual problems.
---
Discussing the merits of layering and then how to make it better is one thing, but saying the problems are "made up" just makes you look incompetent.
---
Fistweavers were amazing raid healers, and the biggest innovation in healing since the launch of the game - too bad they murdered it
---
I will finally start using macros like a pro.
---
Looks good to me
---
I know man, thank God Blizzard is moving forward with layering.
---
layers wont be there for long, if you want to farm high level zones it will be necessary to lvl up fast, wich means there wont be many people around anyway at those zones
---
Maybe medically induced so you can wake up just on time
---
Well we haven't talked about the logistics of how you receive the bucket / truckload of shit. 
---
Plus, a bucket full of shit would either come from a very sick, very large person, or several people, and I don't want to imagine either scenario. 
---
Whereas a truckload would have to come from a waste treatment facility or a farm, meaning it's more like pasteurized milk.
---
Yes, when the tourists have gone. And yes, the whole layering solution is.. Rife with problems. In the unlikely event that the server populations stabilize in a way that the servers are massively overcrowded, what happens then?
---
But as it stands and given what Blizz are trying to do with the layering, I honestly don't think your solution works. I wish it did, I wish there was an easy fix to the whole situation but I certainly cannot see it.
---
...You're aware that it like, literally wasn't an option, right? Private servers are just reverse-engineered from the data they have available on the disc, the back-end for them is a nightmare. Blizzards new server computers basically wouldn't know what to do with it. It's not like they're changing the back-end specifically to mess with playersz it's because the way Blizz uses to do servers and the way they currently do servers are completely incompatible.
---
The tinker is coming next expansion
---
Soon!
---
its not original vanilla population.
---
[Look he doin it](https://youtu.be/Ll3MHIBmDGU)
---
TAKE COVER. EVERYONE WHO IS NOT ALREADY IN STV, GET IN HERE!
---
I didn't realize you suffer from short term memory loss  
---
wasn't talking exclusively about the beta but the stress tests as well, as previously mentioned
---
Well, I accept to wait 3 more months if we have dedicated languages servers lol
---
Depends on the class really. Even in Naxx you saw priests with spirit of redemption where now almost all priests are disc and if they are holy they skip spirit anyways. Druids are very different too and warlocks. At least from what I've seen in vids from vanilla most warlocks didn't have a clue how to dps.
---
????? that is the dumbest thing i've ever heard.
---
Scandinavians will be speaking English. Not only British players speak English in WoW. Insanely dumb point, just go look at the populations of english speaking servers.
---
french surrender lol
---
Nope. There should be no fckn layers at all.
---
 Honestly haven’t seen or heard a single retail player bash classic  
---
oh boi ever been to WoW retail facebook groups? xD
---
Correct me if I am wrong, but I thought that there are one of each server per region? This would mean EU gets 1 PvP, 1 PvE, 1RP-PvP amd 1 RP-PvE? How would these have "unofficial language"? That would be insane rolling RP-PvE only to be with German guys or something...
---
what's semi-casual
---
Agreed I quit current wow got really boring and didn’t feel rewarding I can’t wait for classic wow
---
we DO know what we want after all
---
Leeway is a mechanic to compensate for lag in pvp. If both players are moving, both players have roughly 3 additional yards on their melee swing. This causes an 8 yard melee swing for all races except tauren, who have a 10 yard melee range.
---
Hunters have a dead zone between 5 and 8 yards (i think) which means melee can sit in that zone and kill you while you do absolutely nothing.
---
I started playing real wow got free fully levels characters and started running dungeons my friend brought me to. I fell asleep a few times not understanding what the bosses did and what my abilities were doing (I get a free max level character how would I know what he does) I would still live through the dungeon after sleeping in the boss chamber and my buddy screaming at me over discord to wake up. You can’t tell me current WoW is good. There’s nothing challenging about it for new players and I quit from boredom because getting everything handed to you is not worth playing
---
Thank God Blizzard disagrees!
---
It's because this was never an issue but people need an enemy even if one doesn't exist.
---
We need layering but we also need it to be changed so it’s not abuseable.
---
elemental is one of the best low gear specs IMO, you have blast wave but no ice barrier, maybe mana shield can drain more since you may use it due to no ice barrier, but you have better burst and aoe due to blastwave and pyro. It shines at high gear levels due to how you are able to make your spell power "proc" more often with instant cast combos (some of the casts just replace what would be an AE, which scales horribly).
---
A bottleneck is where a large volume is forced into a confined area... like the first zones where 10+layers worth of players are funneled into a single area....
---
Not sure what you think a bottleneck is.
---
Exactly. Which is the real problem with layering. What happens if the server populations do stabilize that way? I don't know. New realms and free transfers?
---
But OPs solution offers no fix for that nor do I. I can't think of any other solution than new servers and free transfers. Or indefinite layering. Or massive queues, whether those queues are for all or for anyone above lvl15.
---
My god Blizzard stop F'ing this up. Just make normal Freaking servers man!
---
Nice. I mean the cleaver thought process this took to create is just astounding.
---
I'm from NA but I do agree with your post, private EU servers are a good example of this as well. I think they need to implement servers with set languages, it's frustrating playing games like DotA and queueing for English on USEast, only to get matches with Chinese speaking Chinese, Russians speaking Russian, and Spanish speaking Spanish. Why do they queue on USEast servers with the preference "English" selected? Because unfortunately 99% of the countries these players are from are full of shitstains. Nobody hates Russians more than Russians. Nobody hates Mexicans more than Mexicans. Nobody hates Chinese people more than Chinese people. They do it to avoid their own people and as a result fuck over a bunch of other people they can't even communicate with.
---
Hopefully this doesn't happen with WoW to any degree. I know that a lot of third world countries south of the US won't be playing WoW because it actually will cost money. I know this isn't the case so much in EU but I couldn't imagine having to deal with stubborn morons spamming Russian in trade/LGF when 95% of the server speaks English. Maybe if they do implement the system properly there will be penalties for speaking alternate languages in public chat channels. And hopefully you don't get imports of Russian guilds or some other language to your server regardless of the reasoning.
---
Like, more than casual, but definitely not hardcore.
---
Yes they can speak english but most of them are in scandinavian only guilds...
---
&gt;  Can someone explain the problem that Layering is trying to solve? 
---
Huge rush of players making doing anything somewhere between miserable to impossible. This isn't waiting a few seconds to do a quest. If you're unaware of the scope of the issue, it would be easy to dismiss.
---
There will also be the huge dropoff of players, and if you create 100 servers instead of a 20 with layers, you will end up with huge population issues. Sure, you can merge servers, but that is pretty objectively a worse solution as it is less seamless, more jarring, and cuts deep into the whole "server identity" part of vanilla that people remember so fondly.
---
You know what people don't remember fondly? Dead servers. Layering fixes all of this. If you approach everything with a "NOT IN CLASSIC, NOT HERE" mentality, you're only going to have less people within the community.
---
[Look, he doin it !](https://youtu.be/Ll3MHIBmDGU?t=3m28s)
---
ohh gotcha. best of luck to you and your buddies
---
Sharding is more dynamic and will move you from shard to shard depending where you are.... it is even possible to see and interact with ppl from different realms if you get into the same shard. 
---
Layering is creating a "separate" sub server on the same realm. Like a parallel universe but ppl have found the way to "skip" between them using groups and so forth.  
---
Layering is less dynamic version of sharding.
---
I remember City of Evil by Avenged Sevenfold had dropped either ‘04 or ‘05 and I was listening to that album nonstop while playing wow! Maybe add a few songs from that album?
---
Neat. You'll only be behind everyone by several weeks. No big deal.
---
If you don’t like testing features, why are you on the beta server?
---
Not really. That’s only a couple days of casual gaming. The tourist season will last for weeks.
---
Sure, they will thin out as zone level increases, but it’s still going to be an issue until like 50+ zones at least.
---
I disagree with dynamically shitting in any context
---
?????
---
You're pulling statistics out of your ass "most". I've play mostly with Scandinavians on live and surprise, they all speak English. Your point is incredibly stupid, you're being blinded by your agenda of German only servers.
---
I never said they don't speak english, wtf ?
---
I guess we really think we do but we dont.
---
That depends on what you mean? I mean so far the list of bugs people have claimed are:
---
* Warlock Pets vanishing when a new one is summoned
---
* Larger Tauren Hitbox
---
* Feared NPC's run faster 
---
* A few elite mobs damage dealt ranges
---
* Slower respawn rates on certain mobs
---
* Melee Leeway working incorrectly
---
* Weapon normalization incorrect
---
Of that list, 2 of them are legit; the others are all working properly in the beta. But they were challenged by players anyway, and found to all be correct and verified through 16 year old YT video footage.
---
So.... are you asking if people are going to not give you trouble when you make a statement and it turns out wrong? If so, no. This is reddit, they will give you shit.
---
If you are asking when presenting detailed and extremely nuanced feedback the way the guy in the OP did; whether people will listen to you and make sure it gets looked into? The answer is yes. Worked for the OP issue, would work for your well researched issue as well. Presentation is key.
---
It's all nostalgia. Oh wait...
---
try being the adult you are and play classic, but set strict limits to yourself. (how much you can play and when)  And try to make some fixed returning outdoors appointments
---
Im gonna play warrior again.  Only this time, i actually know how to tank.  Its amazing to look back how little i knew about my class or how to play it even half decently.  I dont mind admitting i was just a clicker without a clue.  Still had a blast though.
---
Wow dude, you're just a dick
---
you're a madman
---
Nice lol I have a group of about 10 friends that I will be playing with. 2 groups for 5 mans and 1 for 10s then we will need to expand for the raids.
---
&gt; The french and german communities are as big as the british community in EU, english servers are that big only because all the eastern, nordic and other small countries play in them. ..
---
What point are you trying to make here?
---
It's not just retail "tourists" who have no interest, there's also going to be a large number of returning players, who weren't pserver people. The surge is going to be pretty fucking big.
---
The stable population is retail players who want Vanilla, the diehards who won't go back to free once they've "beaten" WoW, and any retention of tourists and returning players.
---
What's wrong with you?
---
It's a very niche playstyle because a lot of your effect is basically invisible.  You bring unique buffs and debuffs that make other people each do 3-5% more damage and all anyone pays attention to is that you personally are doing less damage than that other characters you're buffing, so you get classified as "dead weight" even if the net damage is higher for the group as a whole.
---
So some servers may experience queues. but if we dont layer Blizz will need 200-400 servers on day one..... and with estimated 50% ppl leaving after the rush it becomes a bit of a lottery if you get lucky with a good server.
---
&gt;Idk what took over this community
---
If I had to guess, it was the abject failure of BFA. The result of which was that many people subbed here and starting looking at Classic as their next Xpack for fresh content, however flawed that might be. Odds are many of these people never played vanilla back when it was just called WoW, so they are used to the creeping casualization that's been at the core of WoW's development since Cata. 
---
Fighting over taps in starting zones? You better fucking believe that's how it was and it was very painful.
---
BFA bad, upvotes please 😏
---
It's called Amish. But I think I'd prefer real life TBC to be honest...
---
I'm fine with the arrow hitting sound. I was using the sound to audibly tell if the arrows hit or missed.
---
What is it about the current state of retail and other aspects of bliz/activision that gives you the confidence to guarantee that?
---
"I'm an arcane fire mage." "Christ."
---
One thing I miss the most was dungeons while leveling. Dungeons were a pretty big deal to do, and they were incredibly rewarding, with big exp boosts and more importantly gear which could make your life a lot easier. Getting two blues from a dungeon could make you go from struggling to strong pretty much right away. It makes it so its easier to level as you don't struggle as much, but then you hit a level where you begin to struggle again. Gear felt individualized and important. I remember when I was level 25-35 I was trying to get these shoulders from RFK because they would have given me a HUGE boost stat wise, it was like a goal of mine.
---
I think server 3 was the most layered and server 15 the lest.... at least those were my observations and blizz did say they were playing with extremes.
---
OK, bye.
---
That non british players in english realms usualy play mostly with their guild in their native language so they don't really count for the english population
---
Funny how streamers had zero effect on servers in the past. No one complained that Athene was on their server or Soda. 
---
Asmon has been on KT for 5+ years and has had zero effect on the population or community.
---
wow hahaha so funny haha so original hahaha XD haha very good XD
---
Any girl is hotter than BFA.
---
All release raids are easy. 
---
Ulduar and ICC weren't as easy
---
Good plan! I'm always down to floss; it's important to maintain good oral hygiene, after all.
---
a member of the community creating events is *by definition* organic. streamers are part of the community whether you like them or not.
---
LOL that projection, just take the L dude
---
That's feral DPS, not feral tank.
---
The dungeon finder that they have right now with Mythics, where you manually form the groups... that is a good tool. I like that. I don't like the automatic one though.
---
LOL
---
It was something that I knew I would personally never see but still liked so much that they were there and marvelously some people made their way into their. They came out with gear that was instantly recognizable and you were just standing there and watching them.
---
Dude you're being childish and difficult for no reason, come on. People shouldn't complain or crriticize an aspect of a game they want to play? How does that make sense? You do realize that community feedback is often how good devs make changes, right? Lol
---
There eilk be one
---
THAT MAJOR OVER THERE IS CASTING FIREBALL. GET HIM!
---
Change it to level 40 and it's perfect. At 40 plus you enter the primary layer. By then the server population will be decently normalized and spread out while still populated. The world would just feel alive.
---
?????????????
---
You must be trolling. idk what to say.
---
Sure, and it fucking sucked. Taking 3 hours to get out of your 1-5 zone is objectively not fun.
---
&gt; This is a perfect example of why idiots should stop spewing “blizzard has the correct numbers and you dont” rubbish.
---
Why would they? Blizzard apparently was able to verify the beta was wrong due to checking it against the accurate numbers.
---
**Blizzard having access to the correct data != Everything in the beta is right.**
---
Its amazing that so many remedial people don't understand that. Im honestly glad so few of you got beta access. Leave it to us to do this, you guys would be too busy blowing a gasket everyday.
---
Edited, ty.
---
Mages lose 8 seconds to evocation, and that is if potion/gem/dark rune weaving isn't enough on top of 45% base regeneration.
---
Warlocks have potions, then have to resort to dark runes immediately, or start incurring a 1.5 global cooldown with even more damage dealt to them, so when warlocks start draining the healers time and mana for themselves yes you can say they have mana problems.  By this logic all classes with a tool that does "X" have no problems in the realm of "X". Rogues are never destealthed because they have stealth, nobody outheals mages in pvp because mages have burst, warriors never die to physical dmg because they have plate armor, orcs are immune to stuns, undead are immune to fear, paladins are impossible to kite due to blessing of freedom, and nobody ever reaches a hunter's dead zone because he has conc shot. Not trying to be snarky, there is just a lot of that type of fallacious thinking.
---
...that's seriously the best you could come up with? lol
---
Northern Swede here. Feel free to take back Skåne whenever you want. We already consider it Denmark up here.
---
I'm not bad, but I kind of want to play it just to troll people
---
in beta quest containers took like 5 seconds to respawn
---
Ditto on Cata heroics. That may have been the best time I had with the game. (Played since WotLK, liked those heroics even more than ICC.)
---
Second would be early-mid legion, since The first 3 raids, spec changes, legendary weapons, and scaling dungeons all combined to make a pretty great experience. Mage tower challenge was also great. It's a shame the world PvP on broken shore wasn't anywhere as good as Timeless Isle, which I'd consider the gold standard for a world PvP zone.
---
Honestly the reason I want to play classic is mostly fueled by nostalgia over FFXI, which had the "dangerous adventurous wilderness" OP describes in a really great way. Dying even made you lose exp equal to ~1/4th a level, including de-leveling you.
---
Most of all I want to play another MMO where leveling isn't a tutorial grind to get past, but a core part of the game.
---
I hope so for all of the RP players man, i feel bad that they don't have an answer yet.
---
Just limit it to starter zones e.g. Elwynn Forest, Westfall and Loch Modan.
---
I really don't see the reasoning behind it. There will be a specific french and german server anyways, it will just not be officially named German or French. That will result in some poor people starting there and then realizing that this ia a Server with 85% Germans. 
---
Just mark one Server French, German and Spanish. Even if Classic somehow completely dies there will always be a popluation on there.
---
If wotlk dungeona were "always a joke", why did the final boss of HOL kill more players than Kel'thuzad?
---
Yeah doesn't really make sense but the main point is that you really under estimate how big the french/germans etc communities are because you compare them to the t english server populations that are very inflated by the non british players
---
shitpost
---
Yes, it’s a great tool to find groups. That’s what it always should have been
---
Level 10 shaman in RFC, I felt like such a liability at level 12, cant imagine trying it st 10. Good of you guys to pull it off!
---
/dance
---
/Spit
---
Those are the most important ones yea?
---
This belongs in the Smithsonian, a true historical motion picture.
---
Your right, the server had to be up for that to happen, launch wasn't exactly a cake walk for blizzard.
---
I'm stuff
---
EU Vanilla launched with a French and a German server.
---
Thank you for sharing kevin’s channel. It was awesome to see someone as knowledgeable as him commenting the game.
---
I played a rogue and raided and had fun. I now kind of appreciate how complicated playing rogue in a raid was vs Hunter or mage so I decided to do it again so I don't get bored spamming frostbolt. I also loved open world pvp and steal thing is just such a fun part of that. Harassing alliance guild that think they can trickle into molten was a blast.
---
So the only thing different would be that I'm going to level as combat since it's so much easier and I'm going to get my fishing up as I level instead of after I hit 60
---
If it will be like this, I'm gonna play on US servers.
---
&gt; I don't believe there's any real world data to back up this claim. Playing on a private server client is essentially "Frankenstein Shareware" and is not an accurate comparison to the real thing.
---
wow isn't the first MMO to try vanilla server. it's not WoW first expansion (which share much with classic release) or their first content patch. the whole layering drama kinda show blizz agree, otherwise they wouldn't bother .
---
&gt;I don't think you're accounting for the technology disruption that's occuring either. Streaming technology and AI specifically could lead to a significant reduction in cost around Games as a Service.
---
dude, game as a service is becoming more and more hated by the day. there's as much future in MMO as there is in coal energy... this is why we went from 10 AAA MMO launching per year during 2006-2010 to  maybe 1 who hardly qualify as MMO.
---
&gt; Most of the bugs in the beta have been found specifically because it doesn't match private servers.
---
Bullshit.
---
Citations needed. Right now.
---
&gt;The only viable tank is Prot Warrior which limits your choices greatly trying to find a tank for your group.If other tank specs were viable the experience would be a lot better
---
LOL.  Fury and arms warriors make better tanks than prot warriors in 5 mans.  Prot warriors have a serious rage starvation issues that gets worse with better gear.
---
That's why they cut the number of people required to raid. So people could play the game
---
I think the big problem with that was that progression doesn't matter as much if your class literally only is in the raid to give some buffs which aren't even influenced by stats. I hated that aspect of classic a lot. I get specialized classes but it was a major flaw in the game. 
---
BC really remedied that by giving most DPS classes a boost to be a bit more equal, while still keeping what made them special.
---
My point is by the time layering is removed, all the pros won’t care anymore since they will be so far ahead from layering abuse.
---
Phasing, right.
---
That’s still a long time. If even 100 people play gnomes/dwarf that’s gonna hold up a lot of people.
---
Simpler layering solution: No layering.
---
Porkplate
---
now imagine you were telling every classic advocate you've ever met throughout the past 10 years that it's just nostalgia. i know you assholes are hiding among us, now own it
---
Random epics through quest rewards are just greens in a purple color that will still be sold to a vendor. Mobs out in the world never posed any threat in this game if you are max level and geared, in vanilla at max level you will be soloing elites with ease. You don’t get teleported around through hubs (lol) and the off tool has nothing to do with GTA. Money is still tight and it’s just that what used to be 1g in vanilla is now 1000g, and prices rose accordingly.
---
This game you are describing is wow and has nothing to do with GTA.
---
I dunno how much this may affect your experience in reality, but Europeans didn't have access to the stress test this time around.
---
It's about 4 times. 12k total, 3k concurrent.
---
Still...you really think that there aren't 12k German speakers (Germany, Austria, Switzerland) players to fill a realm?
---
I mean, for a continent of 512 million people, no matter if 3k or 12k or 50k is too damn LOW of a number.
---
Well you're not wrong, that is definitely a problem, but OPs solution just isn't meant to fix that particular problem. It's meant to make the current implementation less abusable.
---
they could also raise server cap to like 8k and let it sort itself out thought out the first few weeks
---
If those players had to group with someone outside of their guild the whole point is that they WOULD speak English, unlike the Germans whose argument it is that they can only speak German. 
---
They WOULD speak English when playing with people who don't speak their native language Vs. people who exclusively speak German (which statistics say are 20% of the total population)
---
Blizzard are already releasing extremely limited numbers of servers, do you honestly believe those 20% of players could populate 2 whole servers (pve and pvp, totally excluding the fact that they will then further complain and ask for an RP server too)?
---
110% agree with that
---
I hate nothing more than rushing instances.
---
Sounds like you won't like Classic then. That's fine, it's not for everyone and you can still just play retail. Or a completely different game.
---
Literally none of that sounds like a good thing. This sounds like artificial, tedious difficulty for the hell of it.
---
No, ppl just have 10+ years of MMO experience so they know what to do and how to use their class.
---
That doesn’t sound very blizzlike to me
---
Retail isn't an MMORPG, it's an MMORNG.
---
You had to be under the wow game and there was a little drop down menu above the play button to switch between retail and classic.
---
Warstomp over the 25% orc stun resist?
---
Yep, I'm rolling a warrior. I'll keep the ranged class as an alt.
---
&gt; Extreme and threatening-like statements
---
"I'm not playing"
---
...I got nothing.
---
layering and phasing are implemented differently between retail and classic.  code level differences.  Often times companies try to double dip their engineering work / reduce its cost because its usually a huge portion of their costs.  I'm saying that the work going into classic around layering will likely make its way into retail.  That's very likely one of the business reasons why classic is a justified cost.
---
i'm not sure why you spent 3/4 of your comment talking about setting up / taking down x servers, nothing im my comment is about physical servers.
---
I do like that one
---
Do you realize what the starting zones and queues to play will be like at launch with absolutely 0 layering?
---
Jesus Christ “muh classic”
---
speculation.  unless he was in the same area and didnt see him.  they layers # question isn't a hard answer.  it fluctuates based on server pop
---
Never got to 60 in vanilla, but I got my hunter to high 50s and shaman to mid 40s. Tauren enhance Shaman then, tauren enhance shaman through every expansion, tauren shaman again in classic. Something about a massive cow with massive armor weidling the powers of nature must speak to me on a spiritual level, I guess. Also, war stomp is the best racial, and I work hard for my armor, I'd like to be able to SEE IT (cough undead cough) 
---
There's a lot I've picked up over the years from things like professional arena/Pvp, following shaman pros like fnatic Hafu in TBC or Cdew, learning the importance of having keybinds for everything, and simple tricks like rank 1 shocks for utility. From what I remember though, knowing your enemy is just as important, so I'm trying to get more versed in that this time around. 
---
 As far as class mechanics go, I've recently gone through guides and followed the streams of geniuses like Kargoz, Defcamp, and Melderon and learned about intricacies of how the game works and leveling tips like earthbind kiting or frontloading spells to get back into mana - regen mode (in vanilla I had NO idea how systems like these worked). I was 9 years old and garbage back then, I'll be much older and hopefully somewhat less garbage now :)
---
Roll warrior.
---
You can take consolation in knowing that name is too long anyways.
---
thank you sir
---
Think of continents as cakes and layers as slices.. blizzard can cut into the cake to make as many slices as the want for however many people are hungry. When more people leave the party for the day, they can merge the slices back together.
---
They do this every day until one day they dont need to cut the cake anymore because so many people left the party and didn't come back.
---
&gt; 15's should not get much done in WC unless you are talking very, very slow with wipes.
---
Depends. If you have Hunters its not a problem because Hunters don't have huge Hit rating and spell hit/parry/evade issues that other classes do. They can much more reliably damage red mobs and skulls.
---
Really? Because every post I see that has anything negative to say about layering has positive upvotes and anyone telling people to clam down about us is downvoted into oblivion. Not sure where you’re seeing these posts? The subreddit is overwhelming against layering
---
How do we know they aren't planning this already?
---
But cross-realm zones has never been a topic though, right? So the only difference would be that layers are bigger shards, correct? And that it might happen less frequently, but looking at clips from streams it does happen semi-frequently(?).
---
Right, and the specific accomplishment you feel is typically growth. Because it's an RPG, you are simulating a character and you want that character to become a stronger one. So when you defeat an enemy, you want that to feel like it made an impact on the strength of your character.
---
Yes they would if needed, but they like to stay together and speak their native language more so they interact with the server population  way less than british players and tend to play with their guild much more.
---
they could also invite more of us ^^:(

---
The thing is, I don't hate a lot of the changes. I thought the M+ system was brilliant and the legendaries were cool and rewarding. If they somehow mixed a lot of those factors with the aspects of classic wow that I loved, I would love this game. The problem is the bad parts of the game bring the whole experience down so much.
---
This is art
---
Feed your pet! D:&gt;

That's a bit worrying : x

if that doesn't get sorted out before releases it will ruin my aoe leveling plans

The reason classic is classic is that's how things are. I see all these post from people complaining about having to farm soulstones or grinding gold for mounts or having to run to summoning stones, I have an answer that will solve all your problems... just don't play.
---
&gt; but they like to stay together and speak their native language more so they interact with the server population way less than british players and tend to play with their guild much more.
---
How can you possibly know / say that? that is just stupid.
---
I just don't understand how you guys can think blizzard randomly decided one day, ah you know what? fuck the Germans they aren't getting their own servers! They have clearly looked at the population of these servers in relation to other servers, determined a percentage which they believe will play on classic servers (and stay there) and decided that it wasn't feasible.
---
Classic is not for everyone.
---
How would it resolve the problem of server queues?
---
Hahahaha... I was seconds away from responding until I read your last sentence. Yes. Very true. People moaned and complained because Wrath was "too easy." So Blizzard amped up the difficulty in Cata and even showcased a new Cata Dungeon with new mechanics. They even said it was harder. Yep... they went lying. It was rough, especially after 4.0 changes to Holy Pally, but I don't want to go down that road. Blizzard made Cata harder, then people complained because it was too hard. I officially had a full set of blues before the nerf, and I was mad. I almost quit then.
---
Lol actually the same fucking situation here. Gf is playing priest and I lock. personal healbot for when I life tap spam ;)
---
Or just get a good guild and the same communication is trivial
---
Had the same experience in the beta stress test. feelsbadman
---
I played a hunter all through vanilla up to Nef. I’m really excited to play the class again as an alt 1) for the nostalgia fix....would love to run through the rhok’delar quest again and 2) to play the class better with knowledge I have of the class now that I didn’t back then.
---
They have an on-use of reflecting the school for 5 seconds. Obviously they have them equipped already, you can't change mid combat and they have a use delay once you do.
---
Not overly worried about min-maxing. I prefer the Tauren model over the orcs so that's my reasoning.
---
He is testing them.
---
And this is his feedback
---
Oh nice!! That gives me hope, haha!
---
WHY?!?!
---
From my research The way Blizz shards is they create a new "place" and they put surplus of players there no matter the realm. Once you restrict that it kind of becomes layering. 
---
The OP's idea would restrict the abuse of layer hoping.
---
Fuck me... are you genuinely bothered about this or just trying to jump on a bandwagon.?
---
'Iris/eyeball polygon density is off, vanilla had half the polygons in the eyes' 
---
'Npc quest text is is off. In vanilla it is was base10 1.6rem, in classic it's 1.7rem'
---
Just, like, pick a better sword to 'no changes' fall on. Gawd.
---
it's nothing at all when mob spawn times were like 3 minutes
---
I've never considered the extremely low level of entry for active players. Day 1 is going to be a circus shitshow
---
Same as me. Only without the mates.
---
Hasn't the decision already been made? There's classic for people who want the original WoW experience, and retail for people who prefer the game as it is. Further, you get both for the same subscription fee so you're not even really forced to choose between the two except with respect to your own time. This seems like water under the bridge to me.
---
Yes I do, and I would love for it to be that way. I played on Ely\*\*\*\* when it launched, it had 15k players on a single server. Was a blast.
---
Yes that‘s bound to every spell. No matter what I cast, after casting it there will be /spit.
---
hehe xD
---
I played on Classic 12 and found people to be very friendly and chatty. The only streamer-inspired trolling I saw was at the end after the collapsed the server into a single layer. People said hi in random groups I formed in the open world and laughed about getting destroyed by murlocs over and over. Even in the starting area people were forming groups to do quests and chatted a little in the ones I was in. General chat was lively everywhere as well and overall the level of outright trolling was lower than I see in trade on modern WoW the last time I was on. It felt like people were happy overall just to get to play the game and very few seemed to have logged in just to bitch and moan as seems to be the norm on retail.
---
Overall it felt to me a lot more like much older games I played back in the 2004 era where it was more like 80% fun and useful chat about playing the game and finding groups or whatever and only 20% trolling. I think that's about as good as it gets these days in any online game.
---
Funko pops make this a 1/10
---
The beta is basically dead, the game will be dead a month after release. What are you going to do then?
---
This is the exact point he's making. They weren't remotely OP. Death knight was, without a doubt, the worst tank in WOTLK
---
Hunter is such an rp heavy class with all the pets and unique abilities. They seem really fun!
---
Vanilla wow was made for casual mmo players who didn't like EQ lmao
---
Also you have to start your class quests at 10 in your starting zone, not a other one
---
all i see is Pog, whats wrong here ?
---
That’s fantastic. I wish we could find one more person to finish a group, but we figured we won’t have much trouble finding a third DPS (plus, once it gets going, guilds will help a lot, too).
---
I think I’m most excited about hitting UBRS and DM tribute runs again, personally.
---
i wish my gf would play. i would heal her. or tank. or dps. dgaf.
---
I apologize if I confused you, or gave you the impression I was unhappy. I’m not. What I am is tired of seeing posts on every community site of people like yourself with their feelings hurt because you can’t have it your way. Then when the majority of the community responds to your putty  party post or comment you choose to get belligerent and angry. 
---
The simplest thing to do is to find something else to occupy your time rather fill up forums with your immature rants. Accept what Blizzard is giving us or move along.

My point wasn't to find the slowest leveling class, it was to point out a bias, I am aware of the classes leveling speeds, it just isn't relevant to represent them accurately here, (which I didn't do) I said **if**.
---
And you are correct, on the actual point, faster leveling classes are more likely to be 40, people may have gotten bored of the slower leveling paces and quit before 40, others chose hunter and mage for their speed etc. So this is biased even if they rebalanced and made hunters slow and warriors top tier.
---
Every time I log on to Retail (every year or two I give it another go), I just end up doing pet battles.  The streamlined quest process is mindless.  After about an hour of "questing" I realize I have no idea what people I helped with what problem.  I probably wouldn't recognize any of the areas if I revisited them.  I think I end up in a half-sleep daze that is apparently sufficient for for questing.
---
I end up doing pet battles, which are still fun for a bit, then logging off.
---
Strange. I thought I already have seen this here posted...
---
Still these names are just way too good
---
Reminds of LOTR when they go into the mines of Moria
---
When they’re equipped I believe there is a 30 sec cd before you can use. So have it equipped ahead of time.
---
From what I understand it's because the entire continent is being layered not just specific zones.
---
The entirety of phase 1, my friend.
---
Unless blizzard decides we want it to keep going, even if we *think* we dont
---
Yes, because wanting a working product that you've paid for is being selfish. If anything it is you who is, who want to make thousands of people unable to play because you prefer that version of the game. I don't care as long as I am able to play. And if it goes as blizzard have promised there won't be any problems anyways.
---
As a warrior I actually asked in general what level I get any buffs I can cast on others. Sadly the answer was, never, except in parties. :(
---
Which boss did you have to defeat to get to the credits?
---
Wand spec is by far the most efficient
---
I played retail wow 2 years ago for about a month and got bored, would classic WOW be worth it to hop back on?
---
They will switch to classic, level up do content and then quit because nothing changes. So that game will be dead too, so you're right.
---
"So many people" is just the circle-jerk on this sub. Layering is not going anywhere, it's currently the best solution to a very real problem, and I haven't seen any of the people complaining offer a better, realistic solution.

---
Nope lots of bugs still don’t want them ending it til they get em fixed.
---
how is it killing your hype if you're not in the beta?
---
So you watched him literally once and formed your entire opinion on him. I think he's entertaining, and I like to hear people's opinions of the game, so I watch the videos on youtube as well as his stream. I'll probably go back to not watching him at all once classic releases, though. WoW is actually a pretty boring game to watch someone else play imo so once I have the real thing I'll have little to no reason to watch streams.
---
I think this is a really good idea
---
This is basically what the suggestion was back at Blizzcon. Nobody wanted it then, but now suddenly everyone wants it back? Damn Blizzard has done a great job at making a fool out their fans.
---
They're not going to put a hard cap on layering when they have no idea exactly how long layering will be needed. It's a solution to a problem, and they'll remove it when that problem no longer exists. Exploiting sucks, and hopefully they can implement some way to curb it, but it's still a minor issue for the larger population, most people aren't going to be abusing layers in the 1st few weeks.
---
\&gt;Gender female
---
\&gt;biggest turn off: using voice chat
---
Yeah, don't roll pvp if you're gonna bitch about getting killed by another player. Seriously, pve servers will exist so roll on them.
---
Part of what made vanilla great was the fear of getting ganked at any time and then coming back trying to revenge kill, if they were much higher level hearthstone and go somewhere else.
---
Do you see the sassy title? I'm answering bitchiness with bitchiness
---
You do realize that even with layering, the starting zones will be filled with several hundred people right?
---
;)
---
And you trusted him? They've changed their minds many times already.
---
&gt; i personally think the worst thing was the slavery of africans
---
Yeah, talk about a horrendous human rights violation turning into the biggest self-inflicted wound in living memory.
---
Cool don't play. Thank you thrall
---
Not sure when this got fixed but I remember night elf hunters could cast aimed shot in shadowmeld to one shot people out of nowhere. Always thought that was kind of funny.
---
If you’re losing hype before even getting what you want, you weren’t really hyped for it.
---
I'm pretty damn sure that the true 'tourists' will not make it past level 20. The ones coming from retail will be too used to buying a level boost to skip 95% of the leveling to tolerate not being max level for that long.
---
hes just less interested now than he was a month ago, almost everyone is. Hype comes in waves and right now its dying down. I am sure they will do something to build it back up just before launch
---
They do that because they heavily under estimate how succesful classic will be and don't believe in it.
---
There are more options besides layering or do nothing and let the servers catch on fire. Stop pretending like layering is the only possible way forward.
---
long story short, you shy'd away from challenging content on live and get owned by basic stuff on classic?
---
If you have any idea what you're doing and make sure to progress your wands as you're supposed to, wand spec is by far the superior version. Until level 40, the shadow priests offers very little in comparison to Wand Spec. Gravestoner scepter is realistically obtainable by level 23 and deals 30DPS WITHOUT wand spec - no priest spell even begins challenging that until after level 30. And that's not calculating pushback and the like.
---
Been playing Ret Paladin since 1.12. Nothing has been “discovered” about it, it’s still auto-attack and wait unless you like drinking between every mob.
---
Good luck making it to 60... ;)
---
gotcha
---
Porkchop?
---
Yeah, I hope they find a good solution. Because neither suggestion sounds very tempting honestly. Restricting layer hopping should be a top priority, but so should avoiding massive server population and queue times.
---
Oh that's where you're wrong. Me and my busdy both are taking a week off work. Guess I just wanted to remember as I went instead of beforehand. Will definitely still play way too much.
---
Beautiful burn.
---
I do. Still doesn’t prevent your browser from having to load the resources.
---
Porkskewer
---
I do have a monk with Porkchop so maybe sense they wont be in classic
---
The first level 30 on the beta was a mage aoe farming so I am sure its fine
---
As if we don’t have enough thread about layering on this toxic board, you feel the need to link another bad take on the topic from another toxic board.
---
It's better than being able to change layers anywhere because you can't just change your layer on a node and get a new spawn straight away. IF there are other people in the other layers farming the same zone they'll have the advantage of being out in the field while you go back and change layers in the inn. It's several times better than the current implementation.
---
Well I honestly trust blizzards estimates based on current sub numbers, video views, site hits more than people in the classic sub who think it's going to have 10 million players with no proof to back it up at all.
---
With sharing, it isn't even a MMO.
---
It's a small irk and it's something they should polish up. The sounds you hear for days on end is pretty important tho.
---
Mobs all respawned quickly and most people were able to progress relatively quickly.  No lag/crashing.
---
Perhaps but no one can make the perfect finished “remaster” of the experience elements of this, so we need the testers. What this should rapidly become though is the Launch phase of beta , where much wider player input will rapidly reveal any final inaccuracy or glitch that will constitute finishing Wow classic with the honor it deserves!
---
&gt; Literally none of that sounds like a good thing. This sounds like artificial, tedious difficulty for the hell of it.
---
It wasn't for the hell of it, it was because they were worried about not having enough content. That doesn't make it okay, but it does put it in context. They needed people to have goals that would keep them playing while Blizzard polished the next major update.
---
This is the third time in the past few days I've had to respond to people [like you](https://www.reddit.com/r/Negareddit/comments/91a5cy/often_when_people_ask_for_sources_on_reddit/). No, you do not deserve any citation. If you really care enough, go research for yourself. I'm not going to spend half a day collecting a compilation of examples just for you to say "Yeah but what about this...". I'm not your bitch.

---
I mean you just skip the quests that have objects to loot, for w/e reason they dont spawn properly.  tons of people were able to level easily this morning
---
If hype is the only thing that will keep you playing, you'll probably quit within a month or two either way.
---
It's true. I just wish that it wasn't a public beta of sorts.
---
That’s not the point he was making at all.  He was making unholy out to be the worst tank, which if you tried tanking as unholy, you were gonna have a bad time.  Go look at other comments, Frost tanking was amazing for wrath, then when it was changed to blood for tanking you could solo heroic dungeons on a dk and was an extremely viable option for tanking, if not one of the best due to how many cooldown damage reducers they had.
---
That's such a terrible argument.
---
How would you possibly know that English only public servers weren't a problem? People who don't speak English simply won't play on them. For all you know, there's a million Bavarians who would have loved to play on Nostalrius but never dared because of the language barrier.
---
English only servers naturally select for people who are comfortable enough with English to play on them, so you have zero data about how many people are or feel left out.
---
and whats the difference to only EU servers? You will have some dead servers anyway down the line, doesnt matter if there is a (DE)(FR) behind the name or not.
---
Thanks for taking the time to do the math
---
Skåne has gone to hell, so you can have it. Enjoy your stay in Malmö, and try not to be shot.
---
I'm indeed so that white guy :)
---
Make the server size smaller so 10k people can't be logged onto the same server at the same time, then later on merge them.  It's a way better solution.
---
It's not about the classic team tho, the executives,activion, investors, retail team doesn't like classic at all. 
---
Classic is not popular at all in Blizzzard/activison most of them are against it so there  won't be big investments to classic until it proves that it does very well, even if it is obvious that it will
---
You don't have to watch streams. You don't have to review these forums everyday. You can just go do something else until the Aug 26th if you're killing your own hype too much.
---
There's already evidence that the captials are instanced from the outside zone. The capability is there to apply sharding specifically to the starting zones (to reduce competition which is the whole point of layerying) and have it disappear as soon as you get to the level 20+ zones. It's a good solution.
---
Snooze. Having played through all EU server launches and multiple private server launches, I know for a fact that the problem doesn’t exist past the first two to three zones you enter, after that, the drop of is immense, with multiple viable quest hubs for both factions usually on both continents, and all zones being considerably larger. 
---
The side effect is that while leveling close to the release past 25/30 is that zones will actually be populated. 
---
This problem is made up, overblown and has been unnecessarily complicated by bad projections. This has never been an impactful problem lasting longer than a few days for actual vanilla or private servers.
---
The only one coming of as incompetent is you, literally offering nothing but a unsubstantiated comment as an argument.
---
Roll horde. PorkOrc
---
Well, except that layering is blizzards solution to tourists ie. initial overcrowding and trying to pre-empt dead servers. So... I mean yes. OPs solution would fix the abuses of layering. It would also mean layering doesn't do half the job its meant to do. And yeah. I don't like layering. I think it's an absolute shitty solution that relies on too many assumptions and may end up backfiring severely. I think it is better than dead realms and merges though.
---
Hahaha I think you may also be married to my husband
---
&gt; Main takeaway I’ve seen is that up to the lvl 40 content we can see from beta streams the dungeons are all substantially less difficult than private servers
---
Are they? Is it possible that with an arbitrary level cap players just have more time to maximize their current gear?
---
What month is 27?
---
why would ironforge be filled... on beta?
---
You still need that for tanking...
---
Come on. Wow is for losers.

Welcome to why I dont play retail wow
---
So that's what Blizzard meant by " you think you do, but you don't". It's gonna hurt retail wow
---
Hype is just excitment for a launch. It may as well be launched already. I have played since bc and did vanilla pservers and loved it. I know I'll do it all again. Many people voiced similar views as mine before the beta was even announced. Some people like to get thrown in the deep end.
---
Yeah if you started in 2004 and didn't ding before TBC, and have tried vanilla servers but found it boring compared to modern games, then it's perfectly fine but this is just not for you my man.
---
People shouldn't have to skip content to be able to progress in the game.
---
that is literally just a conspiracy theory, and a dumb one at that.
---
Why would investors and high level executives working at blizzard be against a product that could potentially massively increase sub numbers (revenue). Where this product also needs extremely minimal maintenance (no future patches etc...). It's literally free money for them. The retail team are as it sound, the retail team - they don't work on classic. It's none of their decisions anyway, they'll have network specialists and analysts who will make sure the minimum number of servers are required to have a sufficiently populated and healthy server.
---
Not even close to the only reason to go shadow, maybe on a pve server, but on a pvp server, the only reason I would touch holy outside of the endgame would be if I was duo with an aoe class. Free chance at a stun, reduced MB cooldown, reduced CD on your main cc and gives you a new one.
---
Lets be realistic here. That's impossible. Waaay to hyped avoid it.
---
It's good to solo defend flag. Its OP for hunter with stealth pet
---
I mained shadow from beta until wotlk when I went overseas for uni. Never had any problems healing dungeons while leveling, never healed any raids, had plenty of fun. Just go shadow.
---
I could see it being an option in the Inn. 
---
*Make this inn your hearthstone
---
*Buy/sell
---
*Change Layer 
---
Maybe even a population count for each layer, i.e. "full" "high" "medium" "low" maybe even "nearly empty" or some other wording to show a new layer that was made or a layer that is about to be depopulated
---
Your last post is 100% true about classic. Resources management was crucial to your overall success in the game. Resources are finite and mana is absolutely a resource that you have to strategically use in classic.
---
I recently leveled a priest on a pserver and when I healed dungeons I could throw renew, bubbles, and heals around but would go OOM within the first minute or two of the fight and we would wipe. I had to think about mana management and healing efficiently in order to ensure that no one died and the groups run was smooth and successful. This was at levels 30-40, not end game content, but the game is teaching you that early so you understand it by the time you get to endgame content. 
---
Classic forces you to critically think about how best to play your class (whether that be DPS/TPS, mitigation, or healing) based upon the situation rather than simply spamming a button or two.
---
You dont HAVE to skip it, its only because the object respawn time for some objects is bugged
---
Fair enough I guess. Carry on.
---
Simplest solution to layering.. 
---
Get rid of fucking layering.
---
Although I dislike the layering, this is not a valid solution.
---
my boner has grown after reading of how wrong a retail player was about vanilla wow without even playing it in the past.
---
Dont worry, he's a total fucking idiot as evidenced by the rest of his comments in this thread. Just ignore him.
---
&gt;So it has come to my, late, attention that Blizzard will replicate the EU servers we used to have back in Classic. This is in favor of staying true to the Classic experience and how the servers were build back then. I am a #NoChanges guy, but this is a stupid self-for-filling prophecy if I've ever seen one and its a mistake by Blizzard. 
---
Well you certainly could've informed you better before posting. Vanilla had servers for different languages
---
At lvl 43 in plate, the mobs do more damage to me on pservers than they did to streamers with their WW axe out. At level 33
---
I thought the best and quickest was wanding til 30+
---
There's a google drive file called something like "The Collected Audio Work of Totalbiscuit" that has all the Blue Plz archives
---
Also, from the way I see it, language dedicated realms and international realms aren't exactly mutually exclusive.
---
Language based realms will simply be an official way to group players who want to stay within their non-English language community.
---
"English" realms will effectively be international realms. The official place not only for the Brits and Irish, but also for everyone else who is willing to communicate in English. There will still be tons of opportunities for cultural exchange, and certainly lots of hopefully-peaceful cultural banter in General chat.
---
Language based realms aren't about segregating people by their language, it's about giving people the opportunity to either stay within a more localized community or join the melting pot.
---
What is this supposed to be showing? I’m pretty sure Blizzard has always applied a slow debuff which persists for a couple of seconds after you exit it.  You can literally see it timing out on your debuffs lol
---
I was leveling one just to DW tank and then it changed. Forever 63 hahah
---
You still don't have all of your abilities at 58.
---
None of what you just said is true.
---
Layering isn't going to hurt Classic WoW's success. The people bitching about layering (aka the circle-jerk on this sub) are a small portion of the expected population and are going to play it no matter what.  What will determine it's success is the general player-base. For those people, a clusterfuck of a launch with way too many people would do way more damage to Classic than a few people exploiting layering. 
---
Also, the whole point of layering is so the community is healthy long term, and doesn't stagnate...  They don't want to add a bunch of realms to thin the population for launch, because a lot of those realms will die when population declines.
---
Sorry but you are blind... For years they were against classic servers and said no one would want to play it "you think you do but you don't" was and still is the mentality of most of the blizzard employees.
---
They didn't talka bout classic at all in their investor call and said they ahd no major release in 2019 even if classic will probably bring more money than BFA...
---
Dang, it's deleted. Do you still have it by any chance?
---
What's wrong with pointing it out? One of the main goals with Classic is authenticity...
---
why wait?  Link them.
---
I mean, it *is* what betas are for.
---
Neato wotlk dungeons were a joke. I'm talking about raids where they were objectively worst than all the other tanks. 
---
They had the worse cooldowns than feral, paladin, and warriors.
---
They had the less utility than feral (brez, innervate, catform), paladin (divine sac, hand of sacrifice, bop, aura mastery, ardent defender), and warrior (safeguard was a 6 second 30% damage reduction buff on a 30 second cooldown). Death knight brought a 20% physical damage buff on a 3 minute timer, great.
---
You had holy paladin blasting 30k holy lights on you every 1.5 seconds so most of yourself healing was either overheal or inconsequential because the paladin would top you off regardless.
---
You can just make some baseless anecdotal argument about how good DK was but when you bring in facts, it's very easy to see DK wasn't as great a tank as they thought they were
---
&gt;I'm not here to debate this as blizzard has stated this is working as intended.
---
Where is this statement? People keeping saying this but I haven't seen it, and from my research it is NOT working as intended.
---
But the wotlk raid design itself was top notch. Maybe not  the difficulty but boy was naxx, ulduar and ICC well designed as a dungeon imo.
---
Naxx gave you 4 choices to progress through, and you had to complete them all to get to the 5th... completely unheard of at the time! and even to this day i dont think weve had another raid like it.   
---
Ulduar was a long instance with multiple branches before you reach the circle with 4 branching wings again (but only 1 boss per wing and early branches are completely optional).
---
And ICC was linear up until yet another circle of choices and you had to do them all before getting to lich king.
---
I think naxx had the best pathing design because it really felt like 4 raids in 1 (+ final confrontation if you manage to clear them all)... atleast for the first few weeks. Ofcourse some wings were easier than others, due to bosses, but if that was balanced better then it would be the raiders choice which one to do first.
---
And the wings were easily distinguishable from eachother, similarly to ICC wings.
---
ps. Dont you dare misunderstand me, im still not talking about  difficulty at all. Just pure structural design of the raids themselves. And i know Naxx is originally vanilla but hey its in wotlk too! &gt;:D
---
We bought Skåne from Denmark so no, it's ours
---
This is what you get when you cry for throttling in 2019. Batching needs to go, such a silly fucking concept.   
---
(‘You’ as in the community, not OP)
---
That's... any item in Vanilla.
---
lots of retail players this time
---
"That's Uber cool"
---
FROST SHOCK
---
Then be thankful! I'm hyped as fuck and the wait is killing me!
---
Non-language tagged servers don't have the issue that they fragment  a population of a greater area. If Germany has enough players to fill 2.5 servers, you're always going to get a dead server effecting 1/3rd of the servers/population. That's a huge shift
---
If EU has the population to support 12.5 servers you're only effecting about 8% of the servers/population that's negligible. Also it's a self correcting issue as people have the room to spread out at first.
---
I consider it more of a QoL lol
---
Hahaha I’m trying to get my girlfriend to roll priest but I swear it’s only because I think it’s the class that best suits her. Having a personal healer is just a benefit. I just want to be able to play the game with her.
---
Frock.

And when classic ends? That's what is being discussed here.
---
Besides, there are many defending changing retail instead of giving up on it.
---
So because you have no self-control you need Blizzard to end the beta. Got it.
---
Thid is true. But tbh this seems like a problem the community itself is creating an not necessarily th realms. It makes sense for smaller communities to go to the same server but germans and french? Cmon. If the process was natural there would be a decent amount of french, english and german population on each realm.
---
So you're telling me that blizzard are willing to destroy classic to feed their egos instead of making the easiest money they've ever had? You're telling me that and you think you're sane of mind?
---
Kinda done replying now, gl in the future with your conspiracy theories.
---
You can have both core gameplay and class identity
---
I think it was the video of Blizzcon 2018 where they broke down the old infrastructure of Blizzard and the new infrastructure. One of them mentions that they have moved a good amount of their stuff to cloud based, so Vanilla couldn’t work unless they brought everything back in.
---
Kind of a toss up really. War Stomp is super handy since shammies have no CC.
---
This is all too hawt for me.
---
An accurate map of Elwynn Forest in the background.
---
I mean... I’ve been shitting on retail since cata.  It’s not like I’m shitting on it because of some classic vs. retail mindset.... I just fucking hate it.
---
batching is fine, they just didn't add batching they added a delay
---
As their native language? Of course it is. German is spoken in the biggest european country by population and in other countries too.
---
The grind on OSRS is the Pinnacle of mmo grind to me. Really hoping to find a new old home in Classic.
---
As an older player, I would not be looking for something like you propose. My priorities are a weekly raiding schedule that fits mine (fri sat evenings), and a good guild community.
---
With family and work responsibilities, a regular schedule is best imo. Like someone else said, if I need to take every third week off, that’s not a long term commitment I feel I should be making.
---
It’s just the Town Musicians of Bremen. Get over it already!
---
I ran mc for a few months and saved my dkp as a warlock for azuresong mageblade. Never saw it drop and I spent my dkp to get staff of dominance. The next week the blade dropped for our guild for the first time. This time youre mine, azuresong mageblade.
---
Yes and the respawns are dynamic and close to instant when the server launched because WoW maps are not big enough to handle that many players at the same time
---
This is all too warm for me.
---
What a legend
---
It's not that simple tho. Before the Beta all teh content creators were making video content and uploading them, guides and useful info to prep for launch. Since beta dropped pretty much all teh content other than streams stopped over night with only a slow trickle now. I'm still looking forward to classic, but my hype is gone and I've almost tuned out until Aug 27th now.
---
It's true. I think it is for most classic fans. It's a serious addiction. Remember those old news interviews? Lmao
---
I don't see the fuss with layering since new layers are created when the layer population is full, only problem is if you're stuck at the newest layer and few people join your layer. I'd prefer that tbh because less competition on named mobs and looting quest objectives, but only because I intend to level fast to 60. 
---
Then offcourse there's the forgotten blue post, that layers will gradually be reduced as needed to keep each layer with a full population, eventually reaching one layer by the time you are 60. I emphasize on the one layer by the time you reach 60.
---
Then the last issue, how on earth do you think you will be farming the shit out of rich throium veins and black lotuses, if the layers are full??? That doesn't make sense. Your layer has farmers but the othet full layer has 0 farmers???
---
What does makes sense is that the whining is coming from ignorance and the common mistrust of the current blizzard team that gradually ruined wow, and any interferrence with classic would open tge gates of hell. That or you all kids stream sniping Sodapoppin and Asmongold.
---
This could endanger the entire endeavour. All the work rebuilding Cassic, undone by this change.
---
Take my upvote! :) well done
---
Dwarves are Flogging Molly - all of it.
---
Well, that's what they've been doing for years even if they could have made big loads of money already by releasing it earlier, but they didn't.
---
Classic was only released becasue the old lead designer of classic in person went to see the boss of blizzard and had to convince him in person and because an employee had to make it work in his personnal time off work. Blizzard didn't want to invest in it
---
Nah, it wasn't about being antisocial. The mid level zones were pretty much deserted late in vanilla WoW's life. At least that is how i remembered it. There were plenty of times where I was literally the only person in the zone, making it impossible to find other people to group up and quest with. What made it even more frustrating is that there was already a lfg system in the form of meeting stones but NO ONE ever fucking used them (WHY?!?!) while complaining about how hard it was to find a group. I was actually pretty hyped when the dungeon finder came out and was finally able to play dungeons that I could never find a group for.
---
I don't think finding groups will be a problem when classic launches, but it will be once the hype dies down. Maybe people will actually use meeting stones this time around.
---
People dont understand how strong Naxx gear is/was.  Naxx geared players are absolute monsters compared to even AQ geared folk.
---
This subreddit is not the entire "community"
---
I agree. Its hard to push yourself to do content that youve already seen before... even if it was easier.
---
Im originally a WoW player and when Diablo 3 came out... like many people... i bought it and played it, having fun and all... but once i had completed the game once or twice i was already getting bored of doing the same story over and over again. Im not talking about grinding mobs but rather killing the same bosses with only marginal difference in difficulty.... difficulty that can be overgeared eventually.
---
In vanilla it was nothing like that... when my guild went into MC to do progress, we would be doing it on a boss we had NEVER killed before and never even tried the next one. So when we did kill the boss it was literally our first time and then the next boss was a completely new one in every way... graphics, mechanics and dungeon area.  
---
The motivation is clear... you want to defeat all the bosses. Simple and definite.
---
There honestly isn’t anything left to discuss on these posts that haven’t been argued, debated, proposed, mediated or contemplated ad infinitum. 
---
Just try the search bar with “post Naxx”.
---
I actually love this suggestion .
---
Welp, wouldn't have guessed that you guys will be the ones who come out on top of this :D
---
just speak english?
---
coming from a french canadian.
---
I bet you're from Denver, since its obvious you've smoked some good shit
---
Batching is literally a delay. It is supposed to work as a tick every 400ms (allegedly) that registers your spells. Meaning you could wait 400 ms or 1 ms depending on when you hit the refresh window. It obviously doesn’t work like that, and every single action is batched. 
---
It did not take 1.2 seconds to sell three items in vanilla wow.
---
Brave stance, telling the classic WoW subreddit that classic WoW is good.
---
Porksrevenge for tank keeps with the relaunch theme too

Porknbeans for your hunter lol
---
I feel all these pserver players sharing their knowledge of BiS items, best specs, leveling guides and profession guides are ruining the hype for me. There is nothing left to theory craft other than post Naxx content
---
My girl and i are gonna play but im thinking about being the healer cuz she has barely played WoW before lolol.
---
cba replying to another person who believes that German only speakers are even close to those which are willing / actively speak English online. 
---
I trust blizzard and their actual accurate statistics, analysis, and predictions of how many servers they'll need and whether or not the population of German only speakers will be able to fill a pvp, pve, and RP server (which they clearly don't think they can) as opposed to people who are bias on Reddit.
---
Hunter's name checks out.
---
Let’s play classic together!
---
Because Naxx was undertuned quite a bit.  It was cleared first by people who still had a few greens on ffs.  Comparing a joke to another joke doesn’t suddenly make it difficult.   Wrath dungeons were always piss easy, and raiding is also participated in less than dungeons.
---
Just making Enh dps and Elemental dps viable in raids means an extra tank is ok. Especially if they maybe nerf Holy Pallies a bit. Kevin Jordan even mentioned they were hesitant to fix ret/prot for Pally because of how absurd Holy was.
---
You want help with your name...porkoff
---
just be aware that without socializing, you'll forever be stuck in the easy stuff/pug world and won't experience anything the game has to offer,  eventually transforming you into a blind fanatical zealot for other game.
---
Run them out of mana. Don't try to do damage. Just keep running away, continue to slow them with rank 1 Frostbolt, and bait them into shifting. Rank 1 is key here because the short cast time makes it hard to hit with shift -&gt; Feral Charge.
---
Two problems: One, you can't actually see their mana pool when they're in form, so you won't know for sure if you're winning. Two, good Druids will abuse the fact that they don't need to shift to break slows - they can use /cancelform instead. Then they can Moonfire, Insect Swarm, even swing their staff at you to get some damage in, all while saving Feral Charge for when they need it.
---
Overall, it's an uphill battle. You're better off just running away most of the time unless you're sure you can win.
---
&gt; You can visit small dustcovered huts in the middle of the African savannah that speak English.
---
Bad comparison : they only speak English because they were colonized. There are a lot of African countries that speak French for this same reason.
---
Go in the countryside in Russia and China and try to find someone that speaks English.
---
Fwiw I can count on one hand the times I had to use my English skills IRL in France and every time it was inconsequential (lost tourist etc) except once, it got me a 3 days job to translate for some Swedish technicians that were in town (in fact I was needed since nobody in the company spoke enough English).
---
You probably underestimate the number of people that will never travel outside their country and never meet a foreigner. They're the 99%.
---
100k genetic throwbacks.. I can barely parooze this sub without getting triggered by some idiot post now adays . It’s rather frustrating
---
I've rerolled so many times on classic private servers and it always feels like a new experience every time. There is always something I've never done or experienced on each playthrough. I still haven't had most classes at 60 and every class feels so unique in classic that everytime you play a new class it's like a different game.
---
&gt;Meaning you could wait 400 ms or 1 ms
---
and the delay they added means it waits 400ms every single time, not batching
---
Only streamers are getting scarab lord so gg
---
Wow this comment may have just changed my mind. I'm now genuinly happy I'm not as hyped as I was pre beta.
---
Why not make spawn rates higher, it's like traffic--the faster the lights go through their rotation the faster traffic is dispersed.
---
retail bad. me classic player. have bigger brain.
---
If you are uncomfortable playing with someone, why do you play with them?
---
I remember when I upgraded from 256 to 512 it was like night and day in vanilla.
---
I’m pretty excited for all of it really.  You are more than welcome to join us if you would like. The more people the easier it will be to progress
---
If you happen to work at YouTube - you should understand that it does not work. 
---
Working until you view another Warcraft video, is not the system working.
---
A lot of people will get instantly turned off as soon as they get to Darkshore and actually have to read quest descriptions to know where the fuck they have to go. Levels 10 to 20 is still longer than most things in retail.
---
Also mob density is higher. 2-3x the mobs with faster respawns on pservers.
---
I don't get the "support" suggestion, surely under EU law and the law of common sense you need to able to offer support in the language of the country you sell something. What currently happens if someone only speaks their countries language and needs support?
---
Poor poor huntard, simply glazing at his death as it approaches ever so slowly.
---
Lul
---
Remember the "wall of no" and the years of classic bashing and shaming over on r/wow and wow forums? Yeahhh...
---
If the title of this post is any indicator then an extremely vocal and ill-informed minority will decide the fate of the game through some antiquated system and the average players will be much worse off for it. That's my bet on how this ends.
---
J'ajouterais que même si je parle anglais, j'aime bien quand je relaxe me retrouver avec mes amis ou juste parler ma langue. L'élitisme anglo est un peu dégoutant ici.
---
You might. I get insulted a bunch for saying that retail wasn't completely awful.
---
Spell batching was there on private servers and it worked just fine. Blizzard kind of hacked in an artificial delay instead, and it's clearly not the same thing.
---
I would rather have the "you can only change layer in rested xp zones" along with a way to tell you're not in the same layer than your party member someone else suggested in this reddit or the classic forum.
---
Expecting things to be dealed with by lvl 20 could also be but a pipe dream if there are too many players. What if you use layering from lvl1 to 20 and find the exact overpopulated zones layering tries to prevent (along other perks like queue time and so on) once you reach the lvl 20 zones ?
---
Exploiting layering is an issue, but imho layering is the best compromise we could get. Many offered suggestions here to prevent the abuse, now the issue is which one is the most efficient and least harmful one.
---
Simple layering solution - wait till the second phase
---
I could literally just leave a bad group and ask around to join a new one. It is literally just posting in trade chat for me. OR it will just give me the LFG list that already exists within the game, except for one thing, the in-client LFG system isn't used as often as just screaming in trade chat.
---
I lost it at Feta. 😂
---
Lol at everyone thinking they will be able to play. Servers definitely will be down.
---
Tell this t othose who don't speak it.
---
That’s kind of how I remember it.
---
Yeah... right now private servers offer an objectively better product. And I expect they'll get even better because they can use classic as a reference to fix some of the smaller discrepancies.
---
The main change is that it won't take me 4 characters to figure out what I really want to play. 
---
Oh, and I might go engy instead of alch on it.
---
Because in the videos you only see the times they won the PvP.
---
Lmfao the hunter’s pet icon

---
It’s not the streamers that are the problem, it’s the army of kids that they attract. You also have the other army that want nothing more than to cause disruption to the streamer. Being a popular streamer while trying to level would be tiresome to say the least.

The only thing i miss from Wotlk+ is a dungeon that’s short (45min).   Most classic dungeons takes 2+h 
---
I wouldn’t mind a short dungeon or two when I can’t play for two hours.
---
innervate
---
Amazing
---
I believe so
---
Looks more fun to me! What's the problem?
---
Mate, same. My mate got me into WoW back in 2005 when we were both 12/13, I begged and begged my dad to get me a pc and he finally caved. A few of us played up until Cata when we slowly stopped playing 1 by 1.
---
A few of us are coming back for classic, as adults with actual responsibilities, jobs, houses, cars and even kids. I’m so glad Classic is happening, thank you blizzard
---
I'm so pissed about this. I got the stress test invite but no e-mail telling me about it. So I carried on with my busy week and didn't even see it on the battle net app until hours after the server closed =\\
---
I think the big problem is that true "no changes" isn't a realistic expectation. It's not 2005, gaming has changed, players have changed, hardware and technology have changed, Blizzard themselves have changed. But it becomes hard to discuss anything when certain people always resort to "well thats not Vanilla" in any argument. 
---
People need to accept that some parts of Vanilla aren't going to be 100% replicated in Classic. And also that the hardcore classic/private-server players aren't the majority, and that Blizzard isn't making Classic just for them. 
---
There are going to likely be millions of people playing Classic over the 1st month. Most of whom are just normal players wanting to have some fun leveling and doing dungeons, and playing semi-casually. Blizzard cares just as much about the experience those players have as they do the hardcore players, and they are going to make decisions that some hardcore players might not like(like layering).
---
So you are implying cata dungeons were easier than wotlk dungeons?
---
Wait till you get into stratholm. That shit was harder than most current raids.
---
its called generalization. you have to identify the trends and draw the line somewhere. stereotypes aren’t make belief or memes, they form from general expectations and average experiences (ymmw).
---
You damn right!
---
Wow I’m dumb
---
He's not talking about launch, he's talking about when blizzard added new servers to the pool.
---
POG
---
All of you hating on retail stuck with it all these expansions even though you hated it? Oof
---
stereotypes aren’t make belief or memes, they form from general expectations and average experiences (ymmw).
---
Porkrage
---
Layering isn't going to stay. It's only intended for the launch rush, but they can't give an exact number for that.
---
because that would be sharding, and the usefull idiot on this forum already campaigned against sharding.
---
/r/BoneAppleTea
---
Wait, layering exists all the way up to level 60? I thought the implementation was exactly as how you describe, where everyone is just placed on the same layer after a certain level.
---
Unfortunately, even after layering is removed it's going to leave a huge scar on the economy for the remainder of the game. Some guilds will have gathered so many materials they'll be loaded for years.
---
You are aware that you can skip some quests, right?
---
only clothies that don't know how to zig zag
---
Good idea, but it's too simple. I know friends who would already game this type of implementation for arena master trinkets on launch.
---
I would happily play it in exchange for no layers. We should have the option to choose.
---
so should i gear more for strength then swap over to resto(cuz thats what i wanna do) at like level 50? How would you approach that?
---
What's the stat priority for enhancement as well as the weapon type i wanna run
---
hum, from day 1?
---
this subreddit was first populated by a bunch of rando who hate everything.
---
I played classic when I was 13 with two friends from high school. We all played dota 2 and other games together. For some reason we decided to play on a private server to get us ready for classic. Fast forward to three weeks later and we are all level 44 with high level professions. This game has a sick way of pulling you in one hour turns quickly into 5
---
High quality meme
---
Yes they do
---
I dont need a source because if this wasn't the case wed have a lot of useless debuffs
---
Why is this sub so obsessed with people buffing each other?
---
What country are you guys from?
---
Looks like I'm done with my fried eggs..
---
Yeah, no point launching rp servers like this.
---
How is it not simple? Dont watch it..
---
Shut up with the layering posts they aren't going to release an entirely new build with no layering even if they are removing it. It's beta. Layering isn't a bug. They are fixing bugs. It's beta.
---
Thats not what he saidm he said that the why english servers have a lot more people is because pretty much everyone who doesnt have their own servers end up playing on english ones which is probably sonewhat true.
---
ya ive never played classic before the stress tests and the first stress test was a hell of a lot of fun and im so excited for its launch
---
They want to give you a "surprise mechanic". ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
\*\*\*My mates and I
---
My mom is coming into town that week. Good
---
I mean this comment just showed how little you know. You think the "layering" and "starting zones" are a contradiction of terms. You think you need loading screens to phase layers. You think ad hominems make your clueless drivel sound intelligent. Opinion disregarded.
---
Some. Yes. 
---
But that’s a pretty dumb answer to the problem 
---
I can also turn off the game as well
---
that  fucking guy got the same look on his face as 99% of druids
---
So much this, just get rid of the attempts to reimplement batching. The game is better without it.
---
Please God no expansions. Just release it and have it there. If retail got good again maybe people would try it as a soft of silly break from classic.
---
I get the feeling that Blizz simply failed to predict how easily layering could be abused before going through the trouble of developing the whole thing. Specially since the devs said, in Staysafe's interview, after he suggested that layering be only available for zones until level 20~30, that the way they built layering couldn't do that.
---
https://youtu.be/J-9cich-psI go to 8:30 and find deadmines on the chart. Listed as "VC or DM". So it was a thing even if every server didn't use it.
---
innovate :)
---
https://youtu.be/J-9cich-psI go to 8:30 and find deadmines on the chart. Listed as "VC or DM". So it was a thing even if ever server didn't use it.
---
&gt;realistically for the first 20-25 for most
---
Ashenvale is a lvl 18-30 zone and it's good for both horde and alliance, and it has convenient access to both sides (elves down from darkshore, trolls/orcs up from barrens).  Stonetalon is 15-27, and it's also very similar (and I have distinct memories of PVPing in stonetalon).  However that's probably two of the only 'frontline' zones at that level range.  I don't know how popular hillsbrad was with alliance, but it's also a 20-30 zone.  But it would rely on alliance running through arathi which is a 30-40, so it's probably less likely to be immediately competitive (though that doesn't totally jive with my TM vs SS memories).
---
However, given that naturally 3/4th of the horde make their way through the barrens, it is likely that ashenvale and stonetalon will remain contested since the elf side is a pretty good lvling experience if I remember.  
---
All that to say, layering in these zones will be obnoxious.
---
so what? I fail to see what that proves.
---
That is the nature of WoW and the internet.
---
Norway doesn't have a population large enough that plays WoW so they speak English. It's worthless saying 'oh well, if there were enough people playing from every country in the world they could all have their own servers!' - that is a worthless hypothetical the fact is that they don't and as such speak English along with everyone else on English servers (which massively outnumber those who speak exclusively German).
---
Yep. My guild was hovering around 30’ish people online at any given time when they raised the level cap, now it’s around 3-4. 
---
IF and SW are utterly empty. I can count how many horde players I see while out and about each day on one hand. Trade, general and world channel are all dead.
---
Technically raiding is also a journey. 
---
Molten Core is the beginning and Naxxramas is the end.
---
You cant skip to the end... you have to start from the beginning.
---
(unless you get boosted but that was player-driven boosting and not blizzard's catchup gear/store service)
---
Inst this Just like retail sharding? Where tf os full world layering.
---
same
---
You idiotically stated leeway was in Vanilla in your original post. In no form was it.
---
2.3 had HUNTER deadzones removed. The leeway change was added as a result after all classes had their deadzones removed.
---
Leeway or movement padding was added in MoP. It never existed prior.
---
Pointing out that Leeway was an addition due to the deadzone change and that the first deadzone removal was in 2.3 shows your initial post is wrong.
---
Do you want me to point you to online courses that teach critical thinking or has that light bulb gone off yet? FFS, guy GET THERE. Shit ain't hard.
---
There is no such thing as objective fun.
---
Doesn't show for me on chrome.
---
I'd much rather play on a streamer server than having to read FR FR? FR? everytime I try to make a group.
---
As a Vanilla "veteran" I am now realizing how little I actually knew.  Like I mained shaman at first and did not realize they Windfury totem did not stack with rogue poisons, so all the times I dropped WFT in Vanilla for rogues, I was doing nothing.
---
I didn't realize that spells reset your swing timer so I should have been timing my shocks better.  I didn't realize Windfury had an internal cooldown so stormstriking directly after windfury gave me a 0% chance at another windfury.
---
I will be using what I learned about Vanilla/Classic, but not exactly to the point of min/maxing.
---
Why would a closed beta be thriving with players exactly? Betas only have a rush of players when a new pool of people get invited or content is unlocked and only the hardcore bug testing types hang about all the time.
---
I am not claiming that this shall be representative of the distributions when Retail WoW Classic releases, but people may find this interesting.
---
I struggle between rogue and druid. from the fantasy perspective, druid ist my favorite and i like leveling him.   
---
but im scared the healing is too boring or to engaging (like bfa druid). How was it like healing back then?   
---
I also want to dps a little bit. is it also possible to dps as a druid when im playing casually  (dungeons and now and the some raid, not progressing).
---
Wait, one question. What do you mean you “queue’d up” for Rfc? Are you implying that there’s a dungeon finder system in classic or did you manually have to LFG? Just curious
---
Correct me if I am wrong, but didn't they say layering would be phased out eventually?
---
Casual raid guild is a better term. It better expresses your intentions and would get more attention.
---
They were testing layer configurations in the stress test.  At one point it was completely disabled.
---
&gt;But what baffles me is the same people who praise Classics leveling difficulty and joke about how faceroll retails is
---
Who is arguing this? Classic leveling is harder than retail leveling just like Classic raiding is harder than both LFR and normal retail raiding. Can you find a single example of someone thinking they personally find Vanilla raids easy but Vanilla leveling difficult? Vanilla leveling is long, slow and tedious for most classes, but not difficult.
---
The thing about Classic is that the experience is pretty well balanced. If you’re the type of person who will be facerolling raids you’ll breeze from 1-60 and demolish the dungeons on the way up. If you’re like the OP and you’re finding RFC challenging than you're very likely going to find MC challenging when/if you get there. The other thing about Vanilla riding is that the difficulty of raids increases as time goes on. MC is the intro raid and asking it to be artificially inflated in difficulty to appease the 1% is really damaging to the non-hardcore community. We want no changes for a reason, we want Vanilla how it was, with all the perceived good and all the perceived bad.
---
This server opened up at 10am this morning.
---
This is hardly a good representation of distribution considering it hasn't even been open for 5 hours yet.
---
Why would you be attacking hunter pets as a rogue?
---
Yup, especially pre-cata (I think) when they finally added the “return to graveyard” option.
---
Wont we see realm pop statistics up very quickly? I figure within 1 day we will already know what servers are high and low pop so we can pick a good one.
---
These kinds of people think the world revolves around them. They want to argue against this even though it has nothing to do with them and it's hilarious. There's no point acknowledging him.
---
&gt;Fighting over taps in starting zones? You better fucking believe that's how it was and it was very painful.
---
Which is so strange. Group up, and every tap counts for up to five people!    
---
That's what I've been doing in the stress tests. Met a bunch of cool people in the process.
---
This child is def Horde. Too young to consume the requisite enough of Soy for ally
---
I'll be honest i don't understand that table could you PLEASE explain this table in layman's terms i tried reading it like 3 times i think i've only comprehended like half of it ... sorry :( Also, thank you for being such a great help fantastic videos!
---
They did but it was a hidden value.
---
Yeah, I know. The number of warriors is extremely high, for many people shall make warriors and not get them beyond level 20. That being said, the difference between this and polls may still interest some people.
---
I just bought an Aeron for my ass, in preparation
---
It proves norhing but your little rant made little sense because it was completely unrelated to what he posted in the first place.
---
What happens when the content is permanent locked and people quit playing? It's just an omen man.
---
I mean, it's 26k people. That's a pretty decent sample size. The main issue I'd see is that it's all diehards, not a representation of general population.
---
40 is not perfect.  So many good lvling zones are contested and in the 25-40 range.  Layering in desolace or ashenvale or stonetalon or dustwallow is going to suck.
---
I was born ready. It was ok in 2005 and it will be ok in 2019
---
I will be selling boost runs, 5g per go. Hit me when you log.
---
Most Bank Alts are Warriors because they level the fastest from 1-5 (or so Ive seen)
---
Yeah true. Endgame is a whole other journey entirely! But my point was I don't want to rush to get there. I wish raiding in modern wow worked like that, instead of raids going obsolete after a few months
---
Remove your caps lock and shift key please
---
I played wow since it came out . 
---
Rogue on balnazar -EU.
---
Left end of burning crusade and came back halfway through wotlk.
---
I lasted a day, the early days of wow were fucking brilliant. 
---
I may try classic now after this post.
---
Right? It's like people have become so unfamiliar with forming groups and talking with people out in the world for some reason...
---
Do you play on an exclusively German server? is your English limited? Can you no read nor comprehend what is being written? I can only assume that's what it is since you're being this dumb.
---
Waste of time replying to Germans who think they know better than blizzard who have the actual data, goals, and predictions on what server numbers will / should be. cya
---
I don't think it's all diehards. I'm on it only because I'm wanting to practice some routes and get familiar with some areas/quests in the early game.
---
Also, these numbers are of characters created. I already made 3 toons and named them, I'm sure others have made more.
---
It's stuffed.
---
The *only* problem with layering is being able to abuse it to swap layers at will.  You can farm mobs that have to reset/respawn, or jump layers to get at a fresh set of gathering nodes, or most importantly to avoid pvp or ganks.
---
Theres this and the Gryphon bug where taking a flight path and casting a spell right as you land made it so others saw you riding around on a gryphon. Ahh good times
---
My guild never used one because other healers simply had better toolkit. There never was a reason to bring a MW for their healing capability.
---
I'm not talking in the perspective of "we clear heroic in 3 months" guilds, I'm talking in competitive top 100 guilds mentality. MW was bad until BfA.
---
That was the patch before TBC where they introduced the new talents among other things. TBC was released mid January
---
I know people will say this isn’t accurate but it’s pretty close to what we will see on launch. 
---
Lighthope had the same numbers as these pretty much. Shaman pally and Druid being lowest played while pure dps classes and warrior tanks being the highest.
---
This is what ive been saying too. So i agree.
---
Ive even heard top streamers say that "BFA trash mobs have more mechanics than classic bosses" but they  forget to mention how many of those mechanics on the trash actually matter.
---
I stopped raiding in legion and in legion trash mobs only had like 1-2 mechanics that were fatal in any way. Every other mechanic were easily outhealable or just outright didnt matter  at all.
---
The bomb thing in nighthold pre-star augur  could wipe the raid... but thats just 1 mechanic that matters.
---
The satyr trash in emerald nightmare placed a debuff on one raider who would die if other people werent near him to soak the damage. (other mechanics didnt matter)
---
Guess what, vanilla trash mobs also had mechanics that could literally wipe the raid.
---
Molten Core had trash mobs like the fire elementals who summoned smaller ones... if you didnt kill the smaller ones in time they would split into 2 more... this would go on forever until they overwhelmed the raid.
---
Then the doggos MC aswell, if you didnt kill them all at the sametime they would revive.... just 1 mechanic but very dangerous.
---
I dont know of the other raids since i never properly raided them.
---
This is true. I am mostly interested in the number of rogues and then shaman/paladins. I looked into it and these numbers are /2 of the number of people who play that class, to even out for faction-exclusive classes. Shaman was second on the poll for Horde on this subreddit I believe.
---
More importantly, its all people rolling a character they know will be deleted in two months.
---
Its interesting data, but everyone should take it with a big grain of salt.
---
I don't think it was disabled in the first 4 hours.
---
&gt; I'm on it only because I'm wanting to practice some routes and get familiar with some areas/quests in the early game. 
---
If you don't consider that diehard I don't know what to tell you lol
---
Hopeless
---
Watched him until he bored me to death.
---
That’s why full shadow pre 40 is garbage. You’re getting very little bonuses from just using swp and the occasional Mind blast. Trispec or whatever is for sure the way to go unless you really want silence before 40. After spirit tap+wand, priest talents are all fluff
---
I think the best way to put it is that retail WoW focuses more on the MMO part of MMORPG with thoroughly streamlined but shallow systems, while Classic is more focused on the RPG elements- character building, exploration and the *experience* of being an adventurer.
---
played alliance rogue. playing forsaken rogue
---
Because Blizzard decided to move the game on to be less social, but they went way too far to 1 side of the spectrum with LFD, Group Finder would have been the perfect middleground to finding a group easily through browsing a list while still keeping the social aspect to it.
---
And faction
---
Yeah, I was very skeptical about the poll on this subreddit. Rogues were very low down on the table, and warlocks were relatively high, with Shaman being very high also (second most played on horde according to the poll).
---
Yeah the fact that the game lead wasn't originally a dev or designer really shows. It's similar when business and finance people try to make suggestions to our dev team at work. Innovation for the sake of innovation, feature creep. All that comes from a business oriented mindset.
---
Exactement, le soucis n'est pas de ne pas savoir parler anglais, la majorité des joueurs le peuvent.
---
Juste que quand t'as passé 8h+ au boulot à parler anglais plus ou moins, bah t'as envie d'être pépouze chez toi et pas te casser le cul à switch ton cerveau en anglais.
---
Ca va juste amener de la ségregation leur connerie
---
Just because you don't agree doesn't mean it's not important.
---
It's pretty important to the feel of vanilla that people aren't constantly disappearing to another layer to get away from you.
---
I don't consider that diehard in the slightest. I am ultra casual, I play videogames about 4 hours total a week, sometimes less than that.
---
I just like to be efficient with my time.
---
At 40 yes. Full Shadow at 40 is fine, some even put points into wand first and get shadow form at 44/45. Before 40, shadow spec is mostly pointless since all you’re doing is swp+wand
---
Lol you don’t even have a guy taped to the ceiling, LAN party my ass. Bunch of nabs. /s :P
---
What are you talking about? It's a closed beta, we have no idea what content Blizz is going to unlock. Who cares if people quit playing a beta? Everyone knows the characters on beta won't be your permanent character, so dumping tons of time into a character is pointless unless you're big into bug testing. Most people are not. They'll dabble, see if they like the game then wait for launch.   
---
That's exactly what I did with the stress test. I dabbled, found out that yeah my hype is real and stopped at lvl 11 even if I could have continued to play for a day and a half. I'll be playing come launch and plan to be playing for a while just like I did in Vanilla.
---
with an estimated population size of at least 2.000.000 on launch, a margin of error of 2% and a confidence level of 99%, this sample size of 26.147 meets the required size of 20.695, meaning that we can be 99% confident that the distribution is representative with a 2% plus-or-minus figure, though I don't know how general populations and private server populations differ, but yea
---
Of course. I think any poll/PS should be taken with a grain of salt. We shall not know the distributions until release. For example, I am rolling a rogue on this private server, but shall play Shaman come release. Good point!
---
Pretty sure if you have macros that long, it would be far easier to just use an addon that increases the max length. But it's an interesting excise for sure, and it's more fun to find ways to maximise the potential of a very limited language, than just easymode with an addon.
---
Heres the  video, i recall watching it in anticipation for classic sometime ago: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26ACEQmdslA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26ACEQmdslA)  
---
Literally or atleast almost the best gear on the planet on a boss where you  dont have to move an inch.
---
The literal patchwerk-fight. :D
---
Im not german thankd. No one is denying what you're saying. He simply said why english realms were more popular, and that reason is because english is a more common language that people know, thats exactly what he said and thats exactly what you're saying too. Just using different words. He said nordic and eastern europeans play on english realms and thats why they are more populated than german realms. The reason ehy they choose english realms is OBVIOUSLY because most of them know english and not german. Everyone know that but that wasnt his point.
---
Holy shit, the chihuahua pet
---
You have to be a blacksmith to use that trinket though, not just to make it. So you get 1 trinket for going blacksmithing, a single trinket on a long CD that breaks the most easily worked around CC in the game, and you have to keep your cloth wearer a blacksmith to retain access to it.
---
*sarcasm voice* WHY IN THE WORLD ISNT EVERY MAGE A BLACKSMITH?!
---
Yea you get a lot better representation when you have actually people playing instead of “what do you plan to play in 3 months”
---
Got to day that Im a bit butthurt that you didn't include Finland in your part where you told Swedes to piss off. But then again Denmark is the only Scandinavian country I (and most Finns) don't have stereotypical view of.
---
But yeah I had many friends facing same problems especially with russian and spanish players in Vanilla. 100% agree with the post!
---
Yeah and some people hate or don't like classic
---
Yeah, fuck these people playing on a Beta server actually doing testing and providing feedback.
---
It was certainly an overlook on Blizz's side, which will surely be addressed. Also not something that insignificant, since the sound effect provides a queue for your shot having hit or missed the target.
---
Not every bug report has to be something major and glaring like "Stormwind is missing". Actually I'm pretty sure Blizzard appreciates these bug reports that are not so insignificant but also easy to miss.
---
 You realize it’s too much pride I just
---
As someone who plans to be 60 within 7 days I'll enjoy all the free lotus, so I don't mind much.
---
Except they're all shutting down post-classic release.
---
You know, if they want to avoid major lawsuits.
---
That is what I mean, they were behind DK in every aspect. Worse self healing, worse mass grip. Only thing they had was kiting capability with leaps.
---
I mean in BfA right now Havoc's role in a raid group is to be the "Melee Mage", AKA bring the 5% magic debuff that the rest of the raid(literally) needs for their DPS.
---
I would call what you said ironic but I expected something you to say something stupid so it's more of a coincidence.
---
disregarding authenticity, it literally sounds like they copied and pasted the 1.12 sound over the current sound without removing it. i seriously doubt that's intentional, so it's worth pointing out
---
I'm honestly not sure if this is actually possible, or at least feasible. I'm not expert, but is it possible to have "layered" realms for some players and not others? I was always under the impression that it can really only be one way or the other.
---
I also think it would be difficult to have a system that automatically transfers a character to a "full" (for lack of a better word) server once they hit a specific level.
---
I believe that having the layering only affect that starting zones and major cities, for the first couple weeks, would be the best solution. Though, if what you're proposing (and I have heard this suggested before) is technically feasible, then that would be my preferred solution.
---
Tell him you're tanking and to roll a priest.
---
You're not understanding what I said at all, please reread it, slowly if you have to.
---
Unless you're from FR or DE this will be the case anyway. Plus I'll be honest, I don't think that it will be that bad, imo 90% will be english like in any mmo
---
Lol there was not that much fighting for taps in vanilla, unless you rolled on a brand new server that just launched
---
But it's not, Wolfshead gives no crit and more DPS.
---
Everyone here is talking about leveling. Not endgame PvP/PvE specs. MB reduced cooldown is a noob trap while leveling. You should never be casting 2 MB’s unless you’re fighting an elite and not worried about mana. You get very little use out of shadow spec before lvl 40. And after that, you still just MB+swp+wand. That’s it, anything else is wasting mana.
---
Frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt....
---
I wish I was one of his mates..
---
Yeah, god forbid them actually releasing the game and stuff!
---
10 people?
---
I played from mid TBC on 192MB until i upgraded early Wrath, loading times were pretty crazy and my first trip to Booty Bay ended up being a round trip cause the boat was already about to zone back to Ratchet by the time i loaded in \^\^
---
Fuck it. I'll abuse the shit out of it
---
That sentence is a mess.
---
US
---
I'd prefer this, yeah. Either that or sticky layers that stick with you until it's removed.
---
Yea but it was never millions it was 2.5k and then a que even brand new server launches would never compare to what we are about to experience.
---
Horde
---
Poison! Have to admit I stole the name from a lock in my old guild
---
I played more Classic during the stress test than I have played retail since I resubbed last month.
---
And you brought up even more terrible argument. Are we competing? ... If russians and chinese people werent discouraged to join Nostalrius, how can you confidently say, that europeans, who are unimaginable better at language, will have trouble with it? Todays 14y old kids show no trouble playing video games in english language, what about the adult community the wow has?
---
Presmuning I understand you correctly:
---
&gt; if a lot will be changed with talent abilities as well
---
Nothing will be changed, they will stay at the 1.12 patch version
---
&gt;Would either one of these be an obvious better shot out the gate to anyone?
---
Which is a better starting class when classic hits? 
---
Well during the leveling phase it is pretty much impossible to beat a hunter.
---
But if you stick to the game you will spend most of your time at max level anyway. So I recommend against picking a class just becuase of leveling - take the fun one.
---
If it helps you decide:
---
Hunter:
---
- mediocre dps in raids
---
- 1 bag slot is missing because of quiver
---
- great in open world pvp if you have room to kite
---
- great in bgs where it is unlikely that you will be the main focus.
---
Rogue:
---
- super fun in open world pvp
---
- great dps in raids
---
- easy maintenance. no mana, no ammo, just apply poisons and you are ready
---
- Only shines in small fights. AV or raid vs raid is decided by AoE.
---
- great with cooldowns, weak without - if you get caught visible you probably wont live long
---
No they where not there was caps on server population that was no where near 10k
---
What does mage PvP usually look like? I've seen lots of Frost mage and a bit of Fire mage PvP gameplay on the beta and I'm curious if there's a potential for a hybrid build to work.
---
[This build](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/23020520102-0550120022-0330322011002) is what I had in mind. I like to call it "17s" mage. My idea is to weave in frost spells with scorch for consistent damage and CC. Would this work in a PvP scenario?
---
Haha, crazy I found you on here, did we add eachother on discord? Don't remember
---
I’d rather wait in a queue and have the worst experience in the starting zone. Laying is a problem and I don’t believe they will do anything Significant to change it before the launch of classic.
---
&gt; that Blizzard will replicate the EU servers we used to have back in Classic.
---
that's factually false. they had a couple of language specific servers. german, french and uk if i recall that correctly.
---
I just wish layering stopped right after 10 or 20.
---
At 30 seconds you can see the guy running away from sodas dead body.
---
Layering is getting such a bad rep when no one fully understands it. Calm down lads, its to avoid bottle necks due to high capacity of low levels.
---
The last day we had a video that was posted like 50 times giving out about layering, and the guy wasn't eve in the beta. 
---
Why are you raging so much over layers?
---
You don't factor that the 1st char to pop on screen is warrior. Every single person at start will create a bank as fast as possible and it's 99% of the time it's a warrior because it's the 1st to pop on screen.
---
What I wouldn’t give for my friends to want to join me for some Classic
---
No they won't, private servers are mostly people min maxing
---
The majority of the playerbase are tryharders in prviate servers, especialy new ones while on Classic servers the majority will be casuals who play whatever they like.
---
Welcome!
---
Yet the starting zones were packed and people sat in que.
---
I don't believe you played a prot paladin on pservers. Paladin require effort to generate threat. Oom is not a thing anymore. Yes, you can tank raids.
---
Cue. Queue is a line
---
God I wish my friends wanted to play Classic
---

Gosh the sound of cheap shot is so instantly recognizable. I don't wanna divulge too far from Classic talk but the other day on Retail I was pickin herbs on a new alt when I suddenly got cheap shotted, I immediately muscle memoried my trinket and ran. He tried to chase, tossed a blind and smacked me good, but eventually I got to the town and he vanished when the guards aggroed him. I'd of fought back, but like I said it was a new alt, I didn't wanna die :(
---
I'm so glad the sound is the same after so many years
---
I think so! You’re organizing a guild for release?
---
I mean Im pretty freaking hyped. But I haven't watched any streams.  Shift from the beta and watch lore videos or something
---
It doesn't matter 1 bit whether English servers are comprised of 1 brit or 100000000 brits. It doesn't matter what nationality the rest of the population is comprised of. They play on English servers, and 99.999% of them speak English.
---
The main argument for German only servers is that SOME of them can't speak English and as such they deserve their own server. Then I stated that it's clear that blizzards data shows that those playing exclusively German servers now couldn't fill a pvp, pve, and RP server based on whatever metrics they're using. Then he started talking about what nationality the people are who play on English servers (who speak English). That's worthless.
---
Done replying now anyway, I'm gonna lose my mind.
---
If you go to the end of the other thread you'll notice he starts talking about conspiracy theories and how blizzard want classic to fail. It's clear he is not right of mind so there's no point discussing this further.
---
I don't think this is a good representation of the Classic population. The people on this realm are the ultra elite power level nolifer crazy vanilla players that roll on a fresh server that will be deleted in 2 months. Nothing wrong about that, but I don't think they represent the majority of the people that will play Classic ;)
---
I think their approach actually ended up losing them $, though. They gained a short-term increase but that has long been more than offset by a long-term decrease with the playerbase shrinking so much.
---
Taunt is not an issue for paladins when you are in a serious guild who knows what they are doing.
---
good find and definitely needs to be fixed
---
Not a vanilla veteran (although I did play a bit of vanilla in a trial back then), actually a WotLK baby, but bear with me please.
---
Rolled an Undead Rogue as my main and first character, which it continues to be to this day on retail, even if I don't really play anymore. I rolled on a PvE server because I was a bit "scared" about being forced to PvP all the time and thought I was going to get my ass kicked all the time.
---
11 years later, I can't wait to reroll my faithfull buddy on a PvP server and take on all you Alliance bastards. Even if I still get my rotten ass kicked anyway.
---
You want classic to afk with other people in cities?
---
Its literally built on a legion/bfa client and
---
Not every game is for every person. Adding the dungeon finder might help people like you find a group but it also severely damages the experience for a heck of a lot more people.
---
If you had an ounce of wit you would have fired back.  Don't be jealous.  Be funnier.
---
They wouldn’t understand.
---
MoP was a very good expansion? 
---
Sorry, I couldn't disagree with that statement more. It only seems alright in comparison to what became the worst expansions.
---
BC was, in my opinion, the only expansion that actually added to the experience of the game. Everything from WotLK on just took things away.
---
Many stereotypes are unjust and doesn't reflect the majority. And many stereotypes could really be applied to the vast majority of the world, but a specific country might just the branded for it. And often stereotypes are not made about yourself, but by other people - people that often don't really know enough about a given culture.
---
As an example you say, and I quote, *"scandinavians are in no way shape or form as social".* That is just wrong. I live in Denmark and we are not less social than anyone else. We may do things different than in America, but that doesn't mean it's less social. To us, America actually seems overly "fake" and shallow. This is the general impression I always hear when people have visited America. Not that you are more social, but that you just try to look like it. 
---
So no, we are not less social, but we are different in the way we do things and you might with your limited understanding of our ways simply see it the wrong way and make up a stereotype that doesn't really fit. Essentially you lack the ability to judge things with any other perspective than your own. Which again shows why stereotypes are often bullshit.
---
You then continue to talk about how we have immigrant problems due to it, which is so absurd I don't even know where to begin.
---
&gt; i cannot engage with players who actively refuse to communicate with me, mostly due to their unwillingness to speak the most used language around the globe: english
---
It's not like all those countries just refuse to communicate. Shocking as it may be to an American, the world doesn't revolve around you. Also, going by native spoken languages both Chinese and Spanish rank above English, so the argument could be made that it is just as much you that refuse to communicate. Surprisingly, you *can* live your life in a non-English speaking country without speaking English. Who would have thought? Doesn't make them less social just for not speaking *your* language.
---
An orc can walk there from their starting zone and yet you don't question a mob restricted to a level 60 instance?
---
He's saying there was content before to supplment the lack of classic til the 27th, and that now all those sources of content are ONLY doing the classic wow Beta which he does not enjoy. Ergo he usual content is non-existent
---
Not significant amounts at least.
---
Interrupt the druids!!!
---
Memories
---
Superior language skills.
---
Almost like their huge beta testing streams do A LOT more for helping the game than giving access to a random person who hates streamers :)
---
&gt; if this wasn't the case wed have a lot of useless debuffs
---
Such as?
---
Sound like a bunch of kids bitching about anything and everything
---
Not impossible to drop combat mid fight
---
As a past and future Hunter main: thank you for noticing it and raising awareness about it. Hopefully Blizzard will fix this before launch. Have an upvote, man.
---
i’m swedish, numbnuts.
---
“MOM MORE HOT POCKETS!”
---
 “Right away dear”
---
“Dude that’s Uber cool”
---
Thanks for proving me right.
---
Anybody with 10+ years of MMO experience knows motherfuckers ain't never gonna learn shit.
---
That's correct. If you don't like the game you can turn it off and do something else, playing BfA for instance.
---
The obsession is a bit odd, I love it but as a mage I barely have the mana to buff half the people I pass. Arcane intellect is so expensive yo! But I will drink to buff someone if they've buffed me, I do think everybody should at least do that
---
You should post this on the forums if you haven't already.
---
My bad, thanks.
---
Imagine. Saying “you can’t complain. Just stop playing” and being serious.
---
People will still PvP lol. Have you even tried playing Vanilla on a pvp server at any launch? It's PvP haven. The amount of honor you get from random PvP isn't even that much, it's def. not something I think about when I was lvling in all the private server launches, I just wanted to kill people.
---
For me it‘s just to be viewed objectively.
---
Blizzard said they want to recreate an authentic wow experience as it was back in the day. 
---
Well, back in the day in 2005 as a german dude, I played on german servers.
---
Does the authenticity-argument only count for the folks in the US??
---
I really don‘t get it. The say they are working on weapon dmg range normalization, because a factor of 3,3 or whatever is not classic, but 2,9 is.
---
WELL THE FUCKING LANGUAGE I SPEAK WHILE PLAYING IS A BIT MORE RELEVANT OF A FACTOR I WOULD SAY. COME ON - ARE YOU SERIOUS?!
---
Entschuldigung, aber so eine vollkommene unverhältnismäßige Herangehensweise und derart verfehlte Priorisierung von Spieleigenschaften macht mich rasend.
---
Game manuals were soooo good... I miss them so much.
---
Hi, /u/markopctm
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c3thr7/nothing_is_as_incredibly_peaceful_and_calming_as/). 
---
For smooth gameplay you should just skip all the 'gather x' and 'gather x from y' quests. Though, you might luck out and get an empty layer and get free exp.
---
That's only true till a couple levels past 40 where you can get SF and wand spec.
---
But generally, it doesn't pull ahead by that much.  Someone ran some tests a while back, it was on this sub but I didnt save it.  Shadow was faster, but not by a lot.
---
I don't think blizzard is gonna change their intended design 2 months before release
---
not unless entire community pressures them "all or nothing"
---
you get dumbed down version of retail "open world" in you classic wow - you can accept it and play it for the progression, quests, lore and endgame content or you can give up on it.
---
I'd say for someone who never played it the experience is still better than retail.
---
NO, I am telling you that the mouseover component of macros was implemented in vanilla, and worked the way you want it to.
---
Ouch!
---
Yea but you said you can farm 5+ per minute which doesn't make sense since they have a far longer spawn time.
---
Wasn't related to the streamer.
---
I saw warrior was missing the stances, everyone was doing thousands of dmg and had millions of hp.
---
He was doing some quest to kill an elite commander. He went to him and there was no one around, then he joined a group and instantly 15 people appeared while the commander was at 20% hp.
---
This made me sick and remember why i quit back in the day, just didn't expect things to have become so bad.
---
Classic wow is like dark souls level hard . . It was fuckin sick
---
&gt;of how addictive that game was.
---
was?  \*twitch\*
---
Most bank alts are Warriors. I know most of mine have been. But that’s because that’s the default class and I couldn’t be bothered to change it. But not because they’re the easiest to lvl 1-5...I don’t think the time difference matters that much and I don’t think that’s true anyway. Auto attack+heroic strike is pretty damn slow.
---
I think if you allow instances to enable layer swaps also there should be a minimum amount of time spent in the instance before it changes anyone's layer. Maybe 10 or 15 minutes would be a good starting point. If you don't spend 10 minutes in the instance you zone out to your original layer.
---
Your deduction is incorrect. When wow was launched in EU, it came with a french and german server.
---
Scorpid sting from hunters. Ret pallie debuff from talent tree, forget what it's called though
---
You are literally retarded. No one is arguing about if they should do german servers or not. I dont care what he said on another thread. Reply to him there were it actually makes sense instead of replying here to him to something that has nothing to do with what youre talking about. Anyway cya
---
You go at 45 so you get wand spec, but you can still go at 40 if you want.
---
I could've sworn they worked on players too.
---
I distinctly remember using my mouseover macro, and not losing points in classic. I have no idea why you guys are so committed to the idea that mouseover is a new feature. It's NOT.
---
The entire time I played the beta, the sound seemed odd. Thank you for reminding me what it did sound like originally. You're 100% right. To the morons saying it's nitpicking, it's not. Audio queues are invaluble, you can hear and gauge WHEN your autoshot is fired when using weapons of differing speed not to mention it sounds significantly more authentic. Just little things? Everything is off with "Classic". Pets bugged, hunters backpeddling, health regen is off. Minimum range seems off, feign doesnt work. Did you even have to eat or drink once? I literally sold all my food expect pet food. so many bugs. Blizzard we all loved is dead for sure so I dont doubt these incompetant devs will release classic will all the problems it currently has. Vanilla is gone forever, and "classic" so fars been a disappointing attempt at recreating it.
---
No priest ever doesnt take wand spec though.  Even full shadow takes it for lvling.
---
They do. They work on both. At least I. My memory and on private servers.
---
I used to play on private servers at 100kbps. You agree fine.
---
Now I'm at 10mbps
---
Okay. Europe gets 2 PVP, 2 PVE, and 1 RP server.
---
Which languages get which realms?
---
Here maybe. Before Classic was announced though, "yer nostalgia" posts the standard.
---
So we got "layering".
---
1 question. If I dress up my cat as a dog does it count as a dog?
---
Really low IQ :D
---
More undead than Orcs is surprising to me.
---
They do. At least in my memory and on private servers.
---
Does druids actually do this?
---
Do they also buy gear for the priests instead of themselves too?
---
No one gets SOR at 60 anyway, since you are going far into disc anyway there are better talents for the points.
---
You do realise thats not how layering works right - If theres more than 3000 players that are level 15 or 20+ then how are you expecting it to work ?
---
So then they aren't useless even if mobs are unaffected by them.
---
I don’t want it to work any more after level 20. That’s the whole point.
---
I actually read the whole thing back in the day
---
Then you are awful at judging things around you.
---
Just be Shadow full time. Never re-spec to Holy. Just manage your down ranking and bring consumables. Holy and Disc talents are all lackluster, you really won't need them to heal effectively in raids IMO.
---
You could pretty much double the pop for shaman/pally or add them together to get a slightly better example of class distribution as a whole. Pally/shaman may look small but that’s obviously because only one faction can play the class. Combined there’s 3k people playing those 2 which seems average.
---
You don't get the point at all. With no language-specific servers you will always be limited in people to play with, even with english as native language - hint: there are no english speaking servers, all will be a mix. I don't see how limiting the server community in parts will ever be a good thing for the social side of this game.
---
Back in 2004, one of my friends was addicted to EQ and I had the brilliant idea to ween him off by introducing him to WoW. He got hooked on WoW instead and got his little brother addicted too. They stopped playing a few years ago though so I guess technically my plan worked.
---
PERKELE
---
Looks kind of like elementalist, but if that's what you're going for I would put some extra investment and get blast wave.
---
not gonna happen for the same reason layering stays in the game.
---
there will probably be like 2 servers of each type in EU (at best)
---
maybe, or maybe you need more experience.
---
Wheeewwwwww as someone who played D3 for many seasons and then returned to WoW @ WOD and Legion expac releases (just to finish leveling and main storyline), thanks for pointing this out!  
---
It was pretty funny like “Wow, they straight up just took this out of D3.”
---
Mop: the last time WoW was good.
---
Good roundup, hopefully blizzard will take into account people's bug reports. However the Feign death unreliability may require more testing as FD can be 'resisted' with decreasing effectiveness as enemy level increases on your level. That may be working as intended.
---
This is just not True at all. You should test The game
---
I want a server that only uses twitch emojis for communication.
---
It doesn’t take that long if you get 5 thru exploration exp don’t be dramatic.
---
It takes 80 mobs to reach lvl 5 with 0 quests, there are mobs in the zone for you to kill you just might not be able to do every quest. Deal with it or log off and play in a couple days, no one is forced to play launch
---
aporkcalypse

All people who can't speak english go to Alliance and the english speaking people go to Horde ez pz

I played an Orc Rogue in Vanilla and TBC and always wished I had played Undead. Fear was a real pain in the ass.

Beta engagement is not a true reflection of live engagement.  Please reread what I wrote, slowly if you have to.

I’m about to drop the money for 6 months of time.  I had the Winterspring Frostsaber then and I will have it again.

While mobs might not one shot you they are still tougher opponents than in later expansions.

Like I said, there's plenty of people who already speak English well enough and just want to play in their own language like they did 15 years ago.
---
And those who wants to learn English: they can roll on English server.
---
Do you know what objectively is ??
---
you're wrong.
---
I believe I went down to that, then went the rest shadow.
---
Nice work for an Aggie.
---
Wreck em tech
---
There's a better option to all of these: Remove the ability to easily and reliably abuse Layering without intruding on gameplay at all.
---
1. If Character A logs out or quits the game, upon returning, they will be placed in Layer 2. Changing to an alt has zero effect on the assigned Layer of your other characters.
---
2. If Character A joins a group with a character in a city, flightpath, or starting zone that group member always gets pulled to Layer 2, never the other way around.
---
3. If Character A is engaged in any sort of combat, temporarily suspend Layer swapping for any and all party members until the combat is finished.
---
4. When 2 &amp; 3 are not available, the group members that get Layered or don't, will be completely random at first. Once the decision is made, leaving the group and rejoining always forces the same decision.
---
I'm sure there are other scenarios that would need to be considered, but this would eliminate every known method of Layer abuse.
---
I liked the dark souls one more

Reported
---
Based on what? Sounds like you're just trying to irritate people.
---
I played melee extensively in vanilla and didn't get stuff like that...
---
I was a Hunter back in the day and I will be a Hunter again in Classic. Blizzard ruined the class over the years and I stopped playing it altogether by the time Pandaria launched. Now I'm ready to experience it again in all its original glory.
---
Are you scared that you can't actually compete without an unfair advantage?
---
Sounds like you alrdy know what you want man. 
---
Alliance warlock are a rare breed, dps is strong ( pray u have a tank that doesn’t sit on 100 rage) and pvp is fun besides 1v1 undead.  Afaik pet micro is not that intense as that of a hunter. Unless ur going for r14 pvp skill I think you’ll have a good time. 
---
Only big con imo is shard farming but it does add cool class fantasy if that’s ur jam
---
Gl on picking bro
---
Sometimes?
---
The power of innervate is that if you don't need it yourself because you're not terrible, you can give it to someone else and hopefully make them less terrible.
---
It's about playing the game as a team, not about beating someone on the healing meters.
---
Plus you can trade it for favors like getting shields and extra heals when you're in cat form and meleing the boss when healing isn't required.
---
Same here. I was realm 3, so we had a lot of layering, but I buffed everyone that passed, and if they had a buff they returned the favor. Was even asked to group up, but I had to decline since my time was running short and I didn't want to waste their time.
---
Well yea. Just saying that the graph will look very similar when classic hits and people hit max level. 
---
The numbers will be ALOT bigger but percentage wise hybrids will be the lowest and not everyone is going to roll rogue as most people suspect.
---
Did they post this info on their discord? I’d be more interested in this data in a couple days
---
The duelers render well before he passes the line in the video.
---
I clicked this link, at the bar, in public, hope no one saw that
---
not for WoW twinks
---
hunters cant tank
---
Spanish Tauren? Oof. Aren't these the people that torture bulls for sport?
---
From what I know most French people can't speak English, and those that can (not the majority) prefer not to do it.
---
And while we (Germans) are taught English, almost the majority forgets about it or just retains basic skills in that language due to us never having a need for it outside of special cases.
---
I have smart/educated friends including one guy who's working towards being a Doctor and their English is atrocious because they never needed it outside of their School Time.
---
I know that there are many Poles in my age range that never bothered to learn English either because up until "Recently" it was not mandatory either. (My cousin who is 25 never had English in her  school).
---
You can't force people to adapt to you just because more people might be speaking English globally or even in Europe itself.
---
Those are EUROPEAN Server and as such everyone should be allowed to use their language without getting shamed/insulted for not using English.
---
I’m allowed to dislike a person despite them doing one good thing.
---
I don't recall ever getting to have melee attacks at that range back then. I played a warrior for most of vanilla, much of it in pvp, and this just did not happen.
---
Yea because reddit or any forums is totally the face of the community. 
---
Your opinion is unpopular because you’d have to be very interesting to group up millions based off what hundreds do outside the game.
---
omg OP your girlfriend is SO EPIC
---
Not sure what you mean. There currently is an amazing initiative among German speaking players, who've already gathered way over 1000 people to work together and solve this issue for the German speaking community as a group, organized and together.
---
Wish you all the best in your future endeavors, though!
---
that was close, you almost summoned Layering the Layering Layering of Layering
---
Lmao, this sub never fails to disappoint.
---
It's a lot of QA. On days he's streaming a game he's playing it feels like the most time is spent answering questions. But, chat definitely brings some good ones to the table and he likes talking about design!
---
[Layering, Layering Layer of the Layering]
---
Nice list. Your alliance combinations made me think. I might go for the same, but only the gnomes changed.
---
Yeah it's the first 5 points in disc, so its a pretty easy investment.
---
I don't think I can because I dont have access.
---
1) Layers are per continent. The only technical way to stop layering is to drop all players above level X into a given layer. If you do that, you can’t group over that level threshold in a natural way anymore. 
---
2) Layering is a means to an end and that end is to keep the concurrent population at a level the world (not the server!) can handle. Spawn rates are fixed and not dynamic and tailored towards a certain population. Switching off layering therefore can only depend on max concurrent players per realm. 
---
**But most importantly**, your solution tackles the wrong bit of the problem. 
---
Most that are opposed to layering because of PvP and STV. You think along the Lines of “who is involved in this? We need to stop layering for them.” The simpler solution that avoids the issues I gave above is this:
---
**Do not allow characters to be switched to another layer as long as they are *in combat*.**
---
Most 60’s won’t be around until phase 2. I played ALOT on the last private server and I hit 60 a week before phase 2 I think.

I think theres something wrong with me. I watch highlights of his streams on YouTube while playing wow. I hate him with every fiber of my being but I cant stop watching his garbage stream. Hes so abrasive but I can't stop watching. Wtf.
---
I agree. I think the layering problems have  single-handedly made people concerned for Classic WoW where even a few weeks ago they could do no wrong. I just feel like we're looking at situation where in hindsight this was a much bigger problem than we thought. I think those who truly know how to exploit layering, will do so to an extreme extent  and potentially harm the economy forever.
---
Seriously. https://www.twitch.tv/fullstacks

Check out [this clip](https://clips.twitch.tv/TransparentGrotesqueMallardYouWHY)
---
Layer that layer with layered layers.
---
I remember getting them bloodsail boys grinding from 36-39 right outside of booty bay.
---
I always already planning to level a warrior and a hunter, with the hunter slightly ahead to send gear to the warrior.  Guess I'm leveling the warrior first.
---
I think the ones of people farming the STV arena chest, or mithril veins are the most disgusting personally.
---
Relax guys I'm sure this is only for the beta. Right? Right....?
---
Thank you! The sound of the game is incredibly important, and whilst it seems like a small thing, the small things are what make the game nice and just...feel like what it is!
---
I approve
---
CRONCH
---
👉👍
---
That's what I was thinking of doing. I dont mind having to heal in raids as shadow if I have to but for pvp I 100% want to be shadow.
---
Batching on pservers is a more likely to be a hackjob tbh and it was for sure around 100ms rather than 400ms.
---
That being said, hackjob or no, "batching" on pservers allowed for double polys, gouges, etc, and didn't cause all of the shitfest the classic version is currently causing.
---
This thread cuts through all the BS (Wrath nostalgia goggles) and nails the cause of death for the World of Warcraft that had become a cultural paradigm. Anyone interested in the subject would do well to read and understand it.
---
Are you sure you got BETA???
---
So you would want the game not to have the normal server cap on the layer ?
---
Thats completely unrealistic.
---
if they don't fix this rogue is going to be so fucking op.
---
Of course. Especially if a healer goes down and you brez them followed by innervate.
---
That's not it chief
---
People hatewatching him is literally his selling point.
---
Current wow is a mobile game . No satisfaction
---
Considering 90% of your damage will be from wanding... you will want to maybe put points into doing 25% more damage, and you will literally never ever oom while wanding.
---
what about WIM?
---
The fuss with layering is people are trying to world pvp and half of them get thanos snapped away ruining all the fun.
---
Make layers like sub servers once a layer fills up a new one is created and you cannot hop between layers randomly.
---
Honestly watching all these twitch clips of people getting layered in the middle of world pvp has me super bummed.  I'd rather play on a shitty private server with corrupt gms than on official bilzz servers where you get layered whenever you want to have world pvp battles
---
I'm playing a Hunter as I did in vanilla. It was the second class I tried after finding out Druid wasn't so fun for my clueless ass. Made a big ass white Tauren hunter and was so pleased with myself when I tamed the matching while lion. Went on to roll so many hunters as I find the whole rare pet hunting thing a blast and adore kiting in PvP. Hunter was my main until DKs dropped and I discovered my love of tanking, so I'll be sticking with Hunter as my main cause lol no DKs. By the end of Vanilla I was properly shot weaving and could double trap like a pro, just need a refresher. Did the most recent stress test and happily found out I can still kite anything even after all these years.  
---
The only big change for me is I'll be Alliance this time and I know what I'm doing this time around. That and I'll be duo leveling with a warrior, so that 1-10 leveling will be a little less painful. Gonna drag his ass all over Azeroth so I can get my pet skills and black lion.
---
Pretty sure the only people playing anymore at this point are streamers, and they're only doing it because they're getting paid  
---
Why bother burning yourself out doing limited content
---
You didn’t get the beta. You and a bunch of people finally got the launcher update.
---
You did not get the beta.
---
They stopped sending out beta invites weeks ago. If you had the beta you could log into it.
---
Everyone can download the Classic WoW client now, they set it up that way for the stress test, as anyone with an active NA sub could participate in the last stress test.
---
For clarity - the major difference between layering and sharding is that layering happens throughout the continent. Restricting it to specific zones would be disabling it all together and just be sharding. The reason layering is being used is because it is wildly more efficient of a system. Dynamic respawns won't work on live because the servers are going to be too big. It might sound like a feasible fix to increase spawn rates, but what about priests and warlocks who will have to sit around for an hour to tag mobs, even after hundreds have spawned. 
---
I've said this a few times, but I'll say it again. The "abuses" people are using for this aren't a big deal. They just aren't. If you want to put a stop to them, an easy fix would be restricting layer-hopping to rest zones or cities. You can't flee combat or mass teleport onto someone if you can only switch layers at an inn.
---
It's on their website. You can see the server pop/distributions of their other two realms also.
---
I’m not quite sure I understand the “I don’t have time for that in my life” comment.  
---
Time to do what? I haven’t played retail since legion (and even then, super casual), but I’m pretty sure that anyone who is playing on a more competitive level is still investing time in the game.  
---
So, if you “don’t have time for that” in your life, then I assume you’re currently playing retail at a rather casual level. Which makes me wonder, how would playing classic WoW casually then be so different? Is it a sense of completionism that frustrates you if you don’t get to go through MC/BWL etc with your guild? Do you not like leveling (you seem to call it a time sink in your post) and don’t view that content as meaningful?  
---
Just trying to get an understanding of this view as it is one that I really don’t get. Like I doubt anyone is making meaningful progress on retail @ 3 hours a week. And if they only play that much but don’t care about their progression, why couldn’t they play classic in the same way? Solo 1-60 is completely doable.
---
Ooh, Rag’s another awful one!
---
Not true but still funny
---
it's also a beta, the goal is to test stuff like layering, they shouldn't remove it unless it has a testing goal
---
I farmed Diremaul and would make about 10g per hour in just selling trash as a priest. Not sure what my average was with drops because I’d let it all build up and sell it when I had time. But I got into the habit of just jumping into DM and farming whenever I found myself doing nothing. 
---
A solid day of farming should be fine for a week of respecs, but that’s also not considering consumables and what ever else costs you have per week on a character. But 4-5 hours, getting an average of 20-25g per hour sounds about right for respects.
---
I’ve never really looked closely at all their stuff lol this is so great.
---
Well private servers are at least using the original client, whereas Blizzard are not.
---
Try and level as much as I can before I get burned out.
---
What?
---
Link to the post???
---
Lol imagine wanting to be an internet janitor with a whopping salary of $0. No thanks.
---
Lvled a troll hunter with enchanting i believe(professions was not my focus) in a pvp server, to 60 a few months before BC.
---
Gonna lvl a orc hunter in a pve server. With engineering when i reach lvl 60. 
---
Reason: - orc stun resistance (cause i expect more people in pvp going engineering than before).
---
Secondly: Don't have the same time to spare to be ganked in world pvp as i have two kids and a 8-16 job.
---
Thirdly: i'm a much more "meta" player and i'm looking forward to be grenade stunning frostmages who are standing in my deadzone.
---
The whole point is that there should be a choice for players, they should be able to choose between having a fixed language server or a mixed language server.
---
Rather than playing the game of servers being dictated by forum claims for X language.
---
Also it is an element of elitist for the English/British (Im from the UK btw) to decide that everyone should speak their language when brits are some of the worst at integrating into other countries. Its a rather bigoted view to expect everyone to speak english and also rather bigoted to expect people to bow over to us.
---
Nobody is saying you have to like him lol. It's just funny when people on this sub and the forums call streamers bad for the game as an excuse for simply not liking someone. Most streamers share a lot of the same opinions as any other WoW player and they have a voice that Blizzard is more likely to listen to on an individual basis.

First of all leeway was in vanilla 100% in the form of spell leeway, this is easy to confirm and it works differently from melee leeway.
---
This "movement padding" is not leeway- the thing people keep calling leeway and then pointing out "leeway is in vanilla" is the reason people are confused- there was a mechanic that allowed you to swing 2.66 extra yards IF someone came into your melee range and then left it before a swing resolved / a batch processed, but it didn't increase the range UNLESS you moved into the base melee range.
---
You and I are on the same side it seems- I know that the thing people are calling leeway is wrong and a change from cata / mop era, I'm trying to point out to the people who say "LEEEWAY WAS IN VANILLA THO" that they aren't wrong, it's just not the 'leeway' everyone is talking about that is as you put it, movement padding.
---
Help your friends/guildies with dungeons/quests/leveling etc. If you’re in a guild with plans to raid fill whatever roll needed of you for the betterment of the guild. This is my plan anyways.
---
&lt; multiple private server launches
---
What was it? Snooze? Yeah lets use your word. This isn't a private server launch sunshine. How much marketing did those private servers have? How comparable are any of those to classic? Okay, proceed to never make a private server argument ever again when attempting to not look like a complete jackass. 
---
Did you reply to the right person or? I haven't ever made any claim that layering should last forever, or till phase 2, or to any particular and arbitrary level. I actually think ending it at level 30 seems reasonable, but the only people with the knowledge of when that would be viable aren't posting here. That is also a HUGE assumption that ending layering at X level is even possible. I don't know the full functionality of the technology, but my understanding is that a layer encompassed an entire continent. Based on that, while suggesting that layering end at X level seems reasonable, it also is a massive assumption that its even possible.
---
I remember watching a video from a vanilla developer where he would read threads calling blizzard retarded for doing X or not doing Y, and he always thought it was interesting that people assumed so much that wasn't applicable to the current situation, or thought blizzard could do things they can't. Should I end this with "full stop." because thats how high functioning adulting works?
---
A clip I’ve watched tons of times, back when I was playing classic WoW. 
---
Watching it now, it makes me want to roll a shaman when classic gets released in August. 😃

Suicide was removed in a later patch as it made it an easy way out
---
Gods please yes

Cuz that’s all a rogue can kill.

Go night elf.

Youre hopefully going to spend hundreds of hours on your character. You really shouldn’t base that decision on a single ability.
---
If you want to play a nelf priest, I highly advise you to play a nelf priest, cus if u wont, odds are you’ll regret it
---
Get the keys. ALL of them
---
It was extremely mana inefficient though for anything besides AoE farming though. But I’m not complaining, Holy Nova earned me hundreds of gold on my priest.
---
Layer? Hardly know her
---
It doesn't. Not when you limit your powershifting to maximize your utility. You are welcome to think otherwise.
---
you do realise that there's significant overlap in the communities right?
---
Literally don't broadcast your location to the entire world and you'll be fine
---
Night elf priest you need to be good to be remembered and invited.
---
Dwarf priest you just need to be ....
---
I mean the cap isn’t 3k with layering either, because when grouping or trading etc you are already accessing a larger pool of online players than you “should” be able to.
---
What’s wrong with not having a cap at launch and then bringing it down to your set level as the players “inevitably” die off?
---
I'll stick with the data out there that shows you can do it, you stick to Eye of Rend and wasted potential and we'll just leave it there.
---
Play what you want. Priests are always needed no matter race.

Go watch some Rick and Morty, then you too can be intelligent.

Soda literally gave up 10s of thousands of dollars to play private servers offstream because were against Twitch ToS. They could get paid to play retail or other games instead, but they're choosing to play the beta.
---
I had a blast playing the stress test and would love an opportunity to play the beta.
---
they do understand far more than the English community understands from them
---
Wow, this is literally me.
---
When I come back home from work, I have only 3-4 hours to play the game. Why should I spend 1 hour (or more) in a queue?
---
Layering is a necessary evil. Alternatives are even worse.
---
Screenshot this post to gloat later
---
As long as you're not expected to be in a caster group, you can heal as 30/0/21.
---
If you're in a caster group, you're probably going to be expected to drop Mana Tide.
---
It's also pretty dumb to want to play a vanilla recreation but have it not be anything like vanilla.
---
Layering? No, sharding. Layering! LaYEriNg.

LAYering LAYERING LAYERING LAYERING
---
I would have loved that kind fo gameplay, or something similar.
---
Back then WoW really needed some more interresting gameplay for more support centric classes or even healer and their competition already showed that you can certainly make it more interresting (Rift and LotRO both got a well working bard class).
---
Homogenization aside, I was glad at all the more interactive updates to gameplay that happened since WotLK. If only they didn't threw difficulty away for it...
---
I don’t think the guy is trying to say the implementation of layering is bad- I think he is trying to say blizzard predicts x (first month) but in reality wow population could have exponential growth y (for several months). IE blizzard would KEEP layering for several months if they are using the excuse “month 1 will be so bad”. Bc in OPs mind month 6 will be even worse than week 1.
---
I think his first argument isn’t misunderstanding I think he miscommunicated his point and he ironed it out throughout the post to suggest his concern is month 6 or 12.
---
That being said I still disagree. It can be concerning, though, if they do end up saying “well maybe 1 more month.” Or 1 more or 1 more... but I don’t think that’s the case. As the team has been very adamant of it only being phase 1 /launch. 
---
The rate at which players join will be at its highest day one, vs the longevity and rate of new player base  could be higher, but  it won’t be all at the same time like launch.

When he finally got pulled back into the city! Had a blast, even got to kill a few Horde in the process.
---
That’s fine, it’s just a little silly to hate on a version of wow you aren’t forced to play at no point in time.  For retail, it was the version of wow I had to play if I wanted to play wow.  And it would constantly change further away from the game you liked so there’s a reason to hate on it, as it’s literally our only option.
---
But all my friends are on that layer, my guild is on that layer. Ok, one fix which is a bug that you logout and login an alt on a different, again, full layer, but you avoid the guy camping you, still, full layer and if youre in stb, probably gona find pvp, and that should be fixed and is a bug nothing more than a bug.
---
Maybe a few hardcore guilds won't give you a second look, but it won't be a problem like 99% of the time
---
For real. I’ve missed classic a lot. It’s depth is why I’ve missed. They started tearing that away around wrath
---
This guy gets it
---
I know right? Let’s get rid of laying and have the real vanilla experience of millions of players in the same zone. 
---
Oh wait. That never happen in Vanilla either. The game took months before it hit a million players and classic will hit that in hours.
---
Neverpassive
---
i really loved that i recognized some of those sounds as coming straight from warcraft3
---
How about 2 things.  You cant switch layers in combat, and it takes one full minute?
---
This is something a lot of people seem to be forgetting. Vanilla's launch was a shit show, and poor stability, crashes, queues, and maintenance that lasted for days was the general rule for a long time after. Starter zones were never as crowded as they will be in Classic simply because the servers back then couldn't handle it. God forbid Blizzard learn from that and try to do better with Classic.
---
Pet's name too
---
“Moooom, moah hawt poackets”
---
Your experience isn't universal. This was my first stress test and I grouped with plenty of random people. People stopped to buff me as well.
---
You uh.. Realize reddit is also social media, yes..?
---
These days they make like 9 episodes a year. And its all about Trump pretty much. Basically unwatchable for me.
---
It can make several fights much easier. You will see discrimination in guild recruitment, premade invites, and LFG posts. It won't be enough to prevent you from experiencing that content, but how would you feel if even 1% of IRL job postings said "Hiring X (white preferred)"?
---
Always hated daily quest, but I never had the language to describe why. The daily quests for all those reps in BC was miserable, and that was the beginning of the end for me.
---
It makes things feel like a mobile game, log on to do X and then log out. It becomes a job.
---
EVERY spec able to work in raiding..... just keep in mind any non 100% raid spec someone is partially carrying you. 
---
Since the raids mechanics are much simpler you could probably clear all content with 40 GOOD unspecced players at all.  
---
The drama only starts once wiping begins.
---
Retail wow is so fucking bad. Being able to play vanilla (again) for a direct and fresh comparison really drove that point home. I'll probably never play another wow expansion to be honest. I haven't really enjoyed it since I hit 80 in wrath with a few exceptions. Cataclysm was alright, I enjoyed cataclysm pvp but leveling still sucked. Heirlooms, LFR/LFG, multiple classes of each raid tier, zone phasing, daily quests, and class homogenization have killed retail wow bit by bit starting with Dailies in TBC with each new expansion being worse than the last.
---
True, but very little is actually understood about batching. People have fought over it for years on pservers because there's very little hard evidence one way or the other.
---
I mean you’re making a joke about how he is a streamer and so he should automatically be disliked. 
---
But I dislike asmon because of a bar person he is. Not because he is a streamer. 
---
Him helping make a video game beta better doesn’t cancel out the things he does IRL.
---
Except for a very brief time in Cata.
---
... until people complained and then Blizz caved and over nerfed it all again.
---
Maybe that's why he said:  
---
you can't change mid combat   
---
 then?
---
&gt; Random epics through quest rewards are just greens in a purple color that will still be sold to a vendor.
---
And that's exactly my point. You become desensitized. This was not always the case. Back in the earlier days, an epic was epic. Even a green could be a huge find. To you, getting an epic in WoW feels like finding a green because the current version of WoW throws epics at you like candy. This is what happens when you try to constantly gratify your players. People just start to no longer care (which is the point I've been trying to drive home, hint hint).
---
&gt; Mobs out in the world never posed any threat in this game if you are max level and geared.
---
Why would you assume I'm talking about being maxed leveled and geared? I'm talking about making your way through an area equal to your level. I don't know when was the last time you leveled a character, but I did in BFA and at no point did I ever feel threatened by any mob. I would confidently pull the whole area and be absolutely fine. Try pulling three or even just two mobs as a warrior in Classic and see how that works out for you. 
---
What happens when there is no threat out in the world is that you no longer pay attention to your surroundings. I leveled from 1 to 120 and I felt basically no emotion throughout any of it. It was just a monotonous grind. Now, I'm not going to pretend early WoW was anything other than a grindfest, but just the world being dangerous kept you on your toes, not to mention the fact that you'd have to band together with other players on the regular (something I never felt inclined to do on retail). Yet again, this demonstrates that overpowering the player gets old real fast, and providing an actual challenge doesn't.
---
&gt; You don’t get teleported around through hubs
---
I was referring to major cities like Dalaran and what have you (hubs) with portals that lead to many locations all over the world. This (alongside flying mounts) makes the world feel smaller and insignificant. The LFG tool porting you instantly to your dungeon has the same effect.
---
&gt; Money is still tight and it’s just that what used to be 1g in vanilla is now 1000g.
---
True but also not true. Sure, there is no real effect on player economy, but there is on items acquired through vendors. Mounts, flying mounts, riding skill, class skills, etc. come to mind. These can all be acquired comfortably with gold from quest rewards. Not so in early WoW.
---
&gt; This game you are describing is wow and has nothing to do with GTA.
---
It's called an analogy and very obviously GTA and retail WoW are not 1:1. What I'm saying is, is that modern WoW's design philosophy grants its players too much power too fast, which numbs and desensitizes them. This is comparable to activating cheats on GTA in the sense that you'll have a blast for a short period of time killing everything in your path with all the best weapons, luxury cars, and infinite health at your disposal, and then you'll get bored and move on. A sense of progression is important. Modern WoW lacks this quality. I don't know why I even have to clarify this.
---
&gt; Yeah the fact that the game lead wasn't originally a dev or designer really shows.
---
Wait, are you talking about Kevin Jordan here? He was tech support originally...
---
It's a thing I remember people doing in Vanilla. If you were a class that could buff people, you'd buff others in passing to help them out. I remember when I finally rolled a mage, I was so excited to be able to help people with buffs.
---
How it changes? Incrementally is your answer, and it started with people complaining that the game was "too hard".
---
If you don't care about PvP (or min/max in general) roll whatever race you want.
---
Yes, Night Elf Priest is the worst Priest race bar none, and probably the worst class race combo in general. But Fear Ward isn't so big that you won't get invited to raids. Even if you want Fear Ward, you only need like 2 Dwarf Priests.
---
If you don't care about PvP at all, then it matters less. Dwarf racials are very good in PvP. Ultimately just play what you want. Its much better to play a statistically inferior character that you love than one that is optimal but you hate.
---
This is a great idea. As much as petitions on the internet often go nowhere, Blizzard doesn't have language dedicated servers because it believes the player base doesn't have the numbers to support it. A petition would prove (or disprove) that you guys have the numbers for your own server.
---
Which class quests for Mage should I do? Is there an epic quest for mages?
---
Much as we want to get back to the vanilla community. I doubt we ever get the same feeling
---
I'm on the side of having localisation, just was offering something I read on another thread. 
---
I also mentioned reddit's opinion just to point out why there might seem to be more dissenting opinions here, that's all. 
---
I really think that blizzard wants to only have to dedicate the minimum amount of resources they can get away with personally. Like you and many others have said, it isn't a question of capability, I think it's just a question of money sadly. This decision seems to have the same reasoning behind it as having loot sharing in classic. 
---
BTW I speak French and I'm seeing a lot of French players being completely turned off by this decision, for good reason. I may be American but even I can see how absolutely garbage this decision is and I hope blizz comes to their senses.
---
Is it porn
---
He's not all knowing, not all perfect, but the dude is on point 90% of the time. His original class design philosophy is awesome and listening to him about these topics is a blast.
---
Thank god because BFA shaman was dog ass. I quit mine 3 hours after hitting 120
---
The show has literally always been political mockery. This season was for sure weak, but in now wat was “all about Trump”
---
I didn’t say that. Of course the server has to have a cap. There should still be a total player count on each server that leads to the cap. The amount of pre 20s on in that layer, and then everyone else. If the server gets full, then it gets full.
---
Also seriously large battles are scheduled so the devs can prepare the servers for the massive onslaught.
---
And even if a fight breaks out, and numbers climb, the devs still babysit the system under load.
---
Its amazing
---
Vanilla had multiple german and french servers at Vanilla launch...
---
Yeah yeah, you ravager on disc? I know I added a few of you
---
Pressing w feels so rewarding  
---
Classic good bfa bad
---
Have fun.
---
Nope. I've glanced over when my bf plays and it looks so *off*. One zone that he was in had some strange gambling pop up game for goodies, just wtf?
---
Wot? And how exactly are you going to swap tanks when the bleeding stacks go too high? Pray for the best?
---
Actual Mechanics BAD!  
---
Wiping to auto attacks because of random crushing blow good
---
So you want them to stop creating content and stop working just so that you can play in a specific server instead of the 40 other servers?
---

---
This is such a smart fix for the layering problem and your counterargument is "no then I'd have to go far to change layers" no shit dummy
---
Dude check out platinum wow on youtube and watch him enjoying stealth/mind-control combo in pvp...
---
If you want to have fun that will sell you on getting a night elf priest.
---
I got skinnier when I played but I might be the weird one.
---
And on August 26 it will be stuffed.
---
Genuine question: where did they [the devs] state this? Do you have a link?
---
The majority of tourists will be returning players who have quit because of the shitshow the game has become, not people currently enjoying tha shitshow.
---
And change your phone plan to the lowest data amount possible so it's used sparingly.
---
I went to a metro-park with my wife yesterday and we saw dozens of people walking around on their phones, never looking up, and bumping in to things and each other, just barely aware of their surroundings.
---
That's some poison for your brain.
---
Private server lootable object times are very wrong, according to beta info most of them respawn much quicker if not instantly.
---
get 3-4 chars to 60 in prep for BC in X years.
---
One thing to note is that on most private servers (at least the ones i played) the reflector trinkets worked on spells that were already in mid-air. But in actual vanilla it only worked if the cast was not yet in the air. This is something that's pretty disappointing to me since reflecting things like pom pyro's or death coils mid-air was fun and really not that hard (unless the mage was right next to you, then you had less time to react).
---
Yeah it's super strong for about 30 seconds. Still fun as a disc priest to pop trinket and PI on yourself and smoke the mages and warlocks on the meters while spamming holy nova.
---
Leeway and deadzone absolutely destroy hunter PvP. But I still plan on playing one and hoping for the best. Maybe the issues will make hunters less popular and thus easier to find a group as.
---
If Hunter is just unplayable I’ll level my rogue at that point.
---
Asmon is a guter Junge. Pls stop la fromage.  Danke sehr
---
&gt;But I dislike asmon because of a bar person he is. Not because he is a streamer.
---
Then you're in the minority on this sub, and this post doesn't apply to you.
---
so what happens when your above level 20 layer is full and then someone levels to 20 - they get booted from the server ?
---
Most of the ppl here did that 5 days ago and even participated in the June 19-June 21 stress test a few days back. Was fun.
---
"Months"
---
Phase 1 has MC, Ony, Maraudon, 1.12 itemization  and generally  anything that was released with the initial game. No PvP rewards in the form of honor or gear. TM vs SS can keep PvPers interested for a limited time only when the game actually releases. And Beta is not comparable, since most people there, especially streamers, are "creating" content for themselves since they like hanging out in the Beta.
---
Phase 2 will bring the first two world bosses, Dire Maul and the PvP system and rewards, which is huge. It will reinvigorate the wants for PvP and will be needed relatively soon after launch. Since a lot of players who either never played Vanilla, haven't played it in years (on private servers) or since TBC launched, will start playing it I wonder how many people that play from late August until late September are gonna reach level 60 at that point.
---
My guess: not that many.
---
I'm gonna say Phase 2 is gonna come out mid october, since that is the point when the euphoria is probably gonna fall off a lot.
---
Was a undead rogue on server Llane. Changing that to Dwarf warrior with my buddy whose going dwarf pally.
---
What the hell does that have to do with what we're talking about? Lmao. Besides, the most popular Vanilla servers had nothing 'shop' related, whatsoever.
---
streamers?
---
I don't want anything.
---
It's the very nature of the game they're playing and an element of fame. They shouldn't be surprised. People act like this is unexpected.
---
This is a huge blow to both the WoW Classic community and the game. Please change your mind!
---
Thanks. 1 less Neanderthal slowing my dungeon runs down. Enjoy retail!
---
Actually nelf is BiS mind control griefing and world buff purging.
---
KT kill and r10+, not doing the 14 grind ever again.
---
Shit man...you’ve got a long road ahead 😂 how many /played hrs are people expecting it to take, to hit 60 do you know?
---
I'm sure you mean Azuresong Lockblade no? ;)
---
Go horde then, we don't want dwarf haters. Dwarf master race
---
South Park is just a rehash of current events original episode stopped around season 10
---
You obviously can, but your healing output is far less, and your regen is much much worse.  MTT + Mana Spring totem is easily 25 mp5, and can be far more if the fights are short or longer than 5 minutes.   The person most in need of mp5 is actually the shaman too.   Shaman have no regen while casting, yet a lot of their gear is loaded with spirit.  
---
The other problem that arises is "Why do you get to be dps spec?".  It's a fair question too, because respec'ing in WoW is insanely expensive, and healers are really bad at farming gold.
---
🤦🏻‍♂️wd
---
This was better than any full length film I’ve seen in the past 10 years
---
I agree. Getting ganked/camped is annoying so I can see the temptation to abuse layering. But abusing it to farm nodes and rare spawns takes a special kind of scumbag.
---
blizzard spawned a bunch of 60 giants on us
---
Its not just a server per language. Its 3 servers per language.  Pvp, Pve, and Cyber.
---
It was over represented in actual vanilla wow. Now that we have data and know what the end game scaling looks like, many of those people play better-scaling classes. For me it was the fact that no one ever wanted a hunter in their group back the . No thanks, I re rolled paladin and never looked back.
---
People currently playing retail will be a minority of the tourists though.
---
The number of people returning who have quit because of the shitshow the game has become will dwarf retail players.
---
This is the video that made me roll a shaman in Vanilla.
---
He's an awesome dude.
---
Watched all his videos, been on his stream and listened to him on the Countdown to Classic podcast. Can't recommend all of this enough. There is so much insight in especially the original class design, but overall game design as well.
---
I learned:
---
- why paladins got crusader strike removed after beta
---
- how "viable" prot paladins and feral druids were supposed to be
---
- how itemization philosophy was originally different from what retail WoW has now
---
- and so much more
---
Yeah but what happens when the respec cost is 50g? 10hrs a week for 1 respec?
---
you go to German or French servers and adjust then
---
I'm not sure if the servers will be healthy but I'm not gonna deny people the chance to play in their own language
---
in vanilla the Portuguese community kinda had an unofficial server, I saw the blatant discrimination there from both communities, its not pleasant or pretty
---
Next post
---
Bye
---
I love seeing these posts, and then realizing I'm the same exact age with less than half of that stuff.  
---
Which is completely fine by me lol.
---
Sooo basically... its bullshit.
---
You could have just said that. Its reddit, we understand. Putting on this big show about not backing up what you claim isn't going to fool anyway. Relax cowboy.
---
No you didn’t take 2 hrs to find a mob, unless you’re talking about the zombies for the first quest.
---
If you are, here’s some free advice: don’t do the hollows quest if you value your time
---
French is widely spoken, Spanish is widely spoken, Portuguese is widely spoken, Italian is widely spoken
---
English is fine, but there are large enough communities of other languages to justify this risk, it's Europe, not North America
---
Yah, you are not going to get far without talent pts.
---
Oh yeah. Thanks
---
Improved sap!
---
I remember in vanilla, Frost Trap had a pulse for its slow effect. It was not constantly refreshing, like if you resisted a pulse, you could run max speed through it for a time before it pulsed on you again. Maybe Blizzard works like that too?
---
Ich bin disrespectfull weil ich es blöd finde das es keine Ger Server geben wird? In welcher Bubble wohnst du? Es gibt Menschen 40/50/60 + die WoW spielen und keinen cent deutsch können.. es gibt Menschen mit extrem schlechten Bildungsgrad. Es gab Immer Ger Server...
---
Yup!
---
This is completely unrelated but I didn't want to make a new thread. /r/classicwow is **extremely** laggy for me on firefox even with all add-ons/extensions disabled when using the oldreddit theme. This is the only sub I've ran into so far that is this slow. It's to the point where when on the main page/index it could take 5+ seconds to refresh as i scroll down, half the sub goes black for a few seconds as it loads in. And my PC is no slouch either (R7 1700 @4GHz, 1080ti). Has anyone else experienced this? It's nearly unusable.
---
Dude people over exaggerate the usefulness of fear ward and with 40 people and priest being the best healer I'm sure they will have two priests that are dwarves.
---
How many large (gb) was Classic to download?
---
Dude it’s one population lmao. Wtf? It’s not hard to understand. Everyone pre 20 still counts towards the total population of the server online.
---
About the last one, FD can be resisted by mobs.  Is that what you are referring to?  That is intentional, if so.
---
This time I am going to actually use my bank alt, and not vendor mats for a spell I’m never going to use.
---
Unless you have the flag, they're just going to completely ignore you and kill your teammates while you simply watch. Any premade is going to have a better flag carrier than a prot warrior.
---
Prot warr are great in AV to do the main push and tank the faction leaders. 
---
WSG and AB not so much. You really lack damage.
---
I think thats the reason BC dailies were better, aside from getting good gear or a mount, you didnt had to do them to progress in raiding, they just gave you neat stuff and a bunch of gold.
---
About 3.
---
More so Dark Souls 1.
---
I played from he start  up to end.of BC..tried to come back after Wotlk.....nope....it wasnt the same
---
The one who RP's unnecessary much on a pvp server, goes to sleep in Redridge Inn (as Horde), always brings cherry grog to dungeons and proper homecooked food to the tank.
---
Its almost like you don't have to make a new character on a heavily populated server or something.
---
It's silly to play version of wow that you hate just because you want to play wow.
---
And it's sad that for many people almost any change in the game makes game worse for them, for them game have to be exactly the same as when they started playing it. But I'm still sure that main reason for WoW being popular and alive for 15 years is these constant changes
---
It also happens in PvP. It can't be resisted by players, right?
---
&gt;Every gamer on reddit : This should be an easy bug fix, just have to change X and Y!
---
This is pretty much how everyone treats programmers. Apparently most people think programmers are wizards who just conjure shit out of thin air.
---
It was an exaggeration to illustrate the simplicity of Classic content.
---
Well 4-5hrs at a 20-25g/hr rate would get you the 100g required for 2 respecs each week. It’s your costs outside respecs that you have to consider. You could also consider more profitable farms like Devilsaur or DM east jump runs with mining. I went the solo route though killing Lashers with holy Nova and picking up Herbalism for the herbs inside DM east.
---
Did you play the stress test weekend? It was actually worse then the original Vanilla launch. Dont get me wrong.. I loved every minute of it but damn... Aug is going to be fucking nuts..
---
Ah! I thought it was the Bing search engine...
---
Are all Aussies Shamans ?
---
Can you press chain heal and mana totem?
---
I did this. What really happens is you stop existing to a lot of people. It's fine for me because I'm a pretty good communicator, but you will lose out on some valuable friendships by deleting social media. Even if you don't use it everyone else still does.
---
Based, this is big news. I haven't played classic but is the nova delay there like it should be too? Both of those are a pretty big thing for PvP.
---
yes
---
I'll play female human paladin instead of male human paladin. I was so ugly. SO UGLY.
---
Dwarf mages and druids could use "spears". I was devestated when I found out I couldn't use Sneeds Harpoon on my feral druid.
---
Imagine getting this mad  cause you got btfo in a discussion forum LMAO
---
Undertuned =/= "a joke".
---
The raids are asy when you deal with the abilities 
---
It isnt easy when every thing gets to go off
---
Yeah that was just the stress test. I'm sorry
---
It probably cost more to acquire this set assuming RNGesus didn't bless him with it than just buying food would be but if that's what he wants to do then fine. Not an exploit at all. A few pieces of spirit gear, especially for druids and warriors is a great way to cut down on grinding time. Maybe try it some time?
---
Remindme! 65 days
---
the difference is sharding is localized... aka the overpopulation in northshire doesn't cause multiple layer in  gurubashi rena.
---
It's pretty awesome in PvP as being able to pick your targets from a safe location and popping off an ability before they spot you can turn the tide of a fight. OP for hunters with cats and pretty fun for the other classes. Drinking/eating while hidden is always a plus and it doubles as a passive to increase the stealth of a druid/rogue by 5 points I believe, which equals out to one level higher.
---
That's fixed?  it looks like you are hitting that guy from 15 yards away.
---
Everyone talking about this issue seems to understand English
---
25 cm
---
&gt; parooze
---
&gt; Criticizing people for being idiots
---
/Facepalm
---
Good start, hopefully they'll fix the issue with melee leeway still working when snared (when it shouldn't) next.
---
Now they need to fix the slow from Blizzard not being applied until you’ve completely run through the spell’s area of effect.
---
It is going to be a cesspool of Twitch memes
---
https://strawpoll.com/3gr756eg
---
https://www.change.org/p/blizzard-entertainment-make-localized-realm-in-eu-for-wow-classic?signed=true
---
Yup- static ranges should be lower than movement based ranges in AOE
---
The Nova does hit from around 15 yards tho- 14 is its max range as the good lord Medivh intended.
---
Quite the opposite.  Balancing load and lowering bandwidth saves money.  
---
It's common knowledge.. it's all cloud based.  There are no more "servers."  There are many many small servers spread out all over the place - hence the shards.  That is the very definition of sharding.
---
Dump him.
---
it should be fine as long as your guild knows that you are doing it and why.
---
Smh my head
---
Then tell your friends and Guild to apply for a scheduled layer switch where everyone selected will be transitioned to an available layer. Having people get layered in the middle of world PVP is totally game-breaking and is totally against the idea of classic wow
---
He looks like the leader of the Heavens Gate cult in this pic
---
Fuck better get another 16 gb kit to get to 32 gb...just to be safe...
---
Will the cloth turn in system be in classic? I remember hearing that that method of gaining rep is different in vanilla, depending on the patch in question
---
Yeah, the batching they made is pretty fucked
---
I dont think the /who only shows people on your layer, so layering isnt at fault there, its just nobody is there, regardless of layer
---
Yup
---
It all boils down to being cheap; they chose to layer Classic values over a Legion client, because they thought it’d be more cost effective than using the Classic client they have on hand
---
Meanwhile, who knows how many undocumented behind the scenes changes were made, that the players simply can’t know about; and as a result, will never be found
---
Like EU is based on 4 counties only... Come on, it will be the same as it was for everybody else. If somebody intend to play with native colleagues then there are options - guilds, chat channels.
---
Cause his presence alone will significantly impact any server he plays on...
---
i kinda did this on the last big private server and it is totally worth it if you like both aspects. i didn't go full shadow but rather trispec which is better for everything not 1v1. however respeccing capped at 25g there and it will be 50g in classic, so you would look at 200g a week. 100g a week is very managable and i guess 200g is doable too. Raiding as a holy priest has the benefit of being rather easy on consumes and you also don't really not to spend money on any gear besides the wand.
---
i funded that stuff mostly with herbing which was something like 30 to 50 gold per hour on average. not being a "weak" holy priest definitely helped there, i wouldn't have won some black lotus had i been holy.
---
try finding a guild with few warlocks and hope they quickly get their stuff so you can grab the leftovers.
---
Yea tell me what the server population is before launch please. That would be awesome to know. 
---
What other things should I do based on information you don’t have?
---
I miss the whole hard copy thing.
---
Shaduppppp
---
Why then do you lose combo points on a Target after using mouse over blind on another target on 1.12 client?
---
Blizzard never said they were going to maintain a classic experience at all costs.  That would be an insane business and engineering requirement.  It wasn't ever reasonable to think that they wouldn't try to leverage 15+ years worth of experience and technology advancements for use in classic.
---
I just want to have fun. I played an Undead Priest all through vanilla, no alts. Raided up to BWL. Going to roll a Night Elf Warrior and enjoy the sense of exploration of a new faction.
---
Yea but now they mock something he likes so that’s a no no
---
&gt;Back in the old days I left the German Server exactly because of the elitism and dictatorship. And yes, the English server were bloody more friendly.
---
This is why I want german servers. So those players go to that server and we can have proper good english servers. But the good english server DOES NOT exist without having all the bad blood on one nationality server.
---
I agree with you original idea. Your explaining is a bit confusing. 
---
You have to layer if the server is layering. The key is you lock all 20 or whatever level cutoff is to the same layer across the world and opposite factions. Lets call it Main layer. All other pre cutoff players will be on whatever layer.
---
You mean the direct recreation of the batching window from Vanilla that people bitched and bitched for for the sake of PvP authenticity.
---
Thats not how layering works though mate - if you have people on a "unlimited" layer then you are not representing the original game in the way it was originally intended and designed for which means it won't represent that games vision.
---
Private servers fix the issues that come with the population being higher than what the game was designed for by playing around with how the server communicates between zones (this is why some you can't see mobs over borders etc and other janky things) and dynamic spawns to keep people from turning into how people are when they can't do anything.
---
Layering acts as a means to allow players to play the game as intended by having a layer which obviously blizzard can vary to allow for a population in line with the original game.
---
It is of course not perfect but given the curve of server pop for classic is going to deplete in a different curve to the original release.
---
Abusing the shit out of layering, to be honest
---
Do what makes you happy and what you’ll enjoy the most. Optimizing racials is only going to make a difference for the most hardcore min/max raiders. It’s not necessary.
---
Back in vanilla our Priest class leader was Night Elf and she was the most competent and effective healer in the guild.
---
Well, that could be sample bias assuming that everyone you see talking about is on this subreddit, which is an english subreddit as most are on reddit
---
"Data" doesn't exist for this situation. You are taking data from a completely unrelated situation (people who use all of their mana on shifting) and applying it to a very specific situation (people who only shift a handful of times per fight).
---
You have to use common sense in this situation. Which you apparently don't have.
---
I think you vastly underestimate the complexity of this. Those with different writing systems are simple enough, but anything using latin as a base is going to be much harder.
---
Nice thats a good idea actually. Alt on a new faction.
---
Kid, go away
---
Layering is creating a copy of the entire world. You can't make a copy of an area it becomes sharding. There is a technical limitation with your suggestion.
---
The cap is not artificial. Not in the sense you imply. 
---
Yes, the servers can host more concurrent players. But the world can’t. It’s vanilla, there are no dynamic spawns, not for NPCs, not for resources. The world is tuned for a fix number of max concurrent players. 
---
What you imply - modern servers could host many more players - is simply irrelevant.
---
Private servers are most certainly not "mostly people minmaxing", yes all minmaxers play private servers, but the actual player base is primarily casual.
---
me and the boys on august 26
---
yeah pretty much what I'll be doing too
---
This. Do not go fire until AQ/Naxx if you want. You will be useless as a Fire mage in MC/BWL. Some bosses from BRD to MC are fire elementals and they will be immune to your fire spells.
---
😂 do we know how long layerings staying yet?
---
It ain't my job to make you a better player, if you don't want to investigate then don't. I'm not in your guild, you're not in mine, so we won't affect each other.
---
They were already talking purely about PvE when they said the debuffs would be useless, idiot. Pay better attention if you want to be a shitty little smart ass.
---
I thought this was a good video worth watching.
---
Shaman one of the classes that war stomp is most valuable. Can line up some crazy combos.
---
Honestly if you have less than 1TB...
---
YOU ARE NOT PREPARED
---
So? if someone wants to game the system pre level 20 to get the trinket let them. The alternatives are much much worse.
---
No it's not bullshit. Just because I refuse to spend half a day of my own personal time compiling a list of examples doesn't refute a damn thing.
---
I've been following this subreddit and youtube for the past few months, and a huge number of bugs have bound found specifically because of private server knowledge. Not all of the reports have been actual bugs mind you, but many have been. If you want an example, you're in a thread of one. If you want more examples, look them up for yourself.
---
They're gonna make that decision (and similar decisions, like when to move to the next phase) once they get an idea for how fast the player base is going through the game. It would be very difficult to give a firm date this far in advance
---
Do you enjoy being corpse camped or like corpse camping others?
---
Do you want to have to pause levelling cause too many of the other faction asre in your questing zone? Or do you want to completely dominate a questing zone to fuck the other faction over?
---
Cause like, quests are what matter for xp, you can't realistically grind instead of questing because there are too many in the zone. You can switch questing zone, but you can't just out grind the area unless you're willing to put a significant amount of time in.
---
Do you want to pay massive repair bills from 1-60?
---
If yes to all of these, go for a PvP server. They're the servers for people with a lot of patience and a deep seated contempt for your fellow man.
---
life issues?
---
same.  ive added random people as friends for the first time in years.  why?  because we teamed up to kill shit and ended up chatting. 
---
I keep thinking to myself: what if blizzard had invested x% of their game design into systems and features that were aimed at forging long lasting friendships instead of systems and features that reduced the amount of "down time" between mmo content (ex: lfg teleportation, random queuing).
---
Honestly pvp might just not be for you. There are just some people that like their single player campaign stories and that’s fine. For the rest of us, we love shitting on nerds. Really just crushing all the baddies on the opposite faction, and then when they bring their “good” players, you fucking stomp them too cause you’re just straight up better. That’s a good time in my book
---
Those people sound like the kind who will stay for more than a few weeks.
---
Why do you hate him?
---
Accessibility ruined the unique strength of WoW, that of being a glorious journey to remember. Nowadays high difficulty exists as a tool for players to challenge themselves but not as part of the adventure itself. I can't stress this enough.
---
My guild disbanded during the Dragon Soul raid, we had played together for several years yet that's where it ended. LFR being introduced downgraded the raiding experience for the more dedicated players overall. 
---
We were 6/7 HC during the previous tier (not the best nor the worst). However we didn't even manage to clear Dragon Soul on normal before everyone just stopped showing up for raids. The raid itself being bad was also a factor but killing bosses didn't feel nearly as exciting because we had already killed them before in LFR. The magic was gone.
---
Why you need this separation? It was never a problem to build a guild with same speaking peoples on a non fixed language server. 
---
"...servers being dictated by forum claims for X language..."
---
This is what makes my sad. They not even try to see if a mixed server works well for them. No, they try to conquer a server by force, without any experiences how a mixed server will be in the long shot.
---
I'm in no way say that everyone should speak English on a server, but if you try to get help or communicate with strangers use English. You can still join a \[insert language here\] only guild. But in no way there needs to be such a harsh reaction that you say, X is our server now, for our language only.
---
I met so much funny, friendly, lovely peoples in games and communities because I was not that stubborn to stay only with my main language. They reach all-round the world and cultures and I enjoy this very much.
---
I guess I don’t know enough about it then. I thought they could just seamlessly split the layers between levels  up but I get what your saying. There’s probably a better solution then my idea but I don’t what it is. I just want the game to be the best I can possibly be and I hope and pray blizz can make that happen.  Probably just having layering on a timed schedule is the ultimate solution.
---
Another career hunter from Vanilla to BFA. I couldn’t tell you which patch it changed in, but I have accounts on pservers that run 1.12, TBC and WOTLK so now I want to test all three back to back...
---
I see. So it seems like both solutions face serious technical limitations then.
---
100% this! Almost nobody ever talks about that and just claims "warriors super overpopulated hur dur". Most people never change their class from the default one (warrior) when making a bank alt because it makes no difference at level 1 for banking
---
Depends how efficient you are and the class you play
---
What's blocking you? Form a guild, community or a chat channel.
---
Somehow other nations have managed it.
---
ROFL!
---
Beat C’ Thun in AQ 40. My guild never made it that far. I’d also like to progress in PvP and see how far I can get.
---
Crowd manual pummler is your bis, but if we talking offhand then tome of knowledge is the highest amount you can get. No clue what it is for the green offhand, but it's less.
---
&gt; 10s of thousands of dollars 
---
How to English?
---
It's a different experience playing the game when you can relog to get to a new server away from the people you normally would have had to quest around just because there's a few mobs dead that you have to wait for. Normally you'd join a group to kill it together, but if there's layering you'll relog and kill it alone.
---
I never noticed that map in the background. Is that Elwyn Forest?
---
This isn't even his final form :)
---
All the good pservers will die out with classic launch. The server you specifically mentioned is literally shutting down before it comes out.
---
These issues will most likely be patched before launch. If somehow they aren't, it might make me rethink playing Hunter as my first main.
---
Critical thinking good
---
Randomly shilling for billionaire game devs with no creative freedom due to board member profit motives bad
---
My god, did that player on the top right have a stroke or is he like 8 years old?
---
Why is this post not deleted yet?
---
Unless it's one of a billion collection quests, where you do all the dmg and loot every fifth mob
---
Not really sure what u want an ELI5 of...
---
Just make yourself a notepad with russian characters (Something like [this](http://prntscr.com/o5d1m6) ) and how to pronounce them. And just learn it :D 
---
 "у меня нет щита" in latin characters is something like "u menja njet shschita" ... I had to google what "щита" means but the whole sentence means "I don't have a shield".
---
No, that was 3000 people playing and the rest 7k+ sitting in a login queue, which everybody hated.
---
I think of MCP as more of a consumable than my actual weapon.
---
I spotted an error. It's usually the hunter who stays alive after he fucks up, because Feign Death and f*ck all.
---
May I join you guys?
---
Mods are on the wrong layer
---
The original 3K was due to hardware limitation. The current 3K is to emulate similar feeling. 
---
The world can accommodate a lot more players if they are spread out over territory and playtime. And by level 20-30 a week into Classic that is exactly what will happen.
---
In the absence of a better solution layering is by far the best option.
---
Still my favorite South Park episode of all time, and a major part of why myself (and I assume a lot of others) got into WoW in the first place.
---
&gt; Thinking the intelligence of a post in an international community is determined solely by its grasp of English and its spelling
---
/facepalm
---
Layering is stupid as fuck. Get rid of the shit. Your beta is dying. Turn beta off. Blizzard ruining shit once again. They can’t get anything right.
---
The window is authentic for sure but something is definitely wrong with it- the blizzard behavior is decent evidence of that.
---
I'm sad people bitched for it, it's a terrible addition imo even if done flawlessly, which it is not.
---
Private server 100ms windows felt 10x better and didn't have the weird interactions like [seduction and shadowbolt](https://www.twitch.tv/aylegaming/clip/LitigiousFrigidOrcaRalpherZ)
---
I fucking hate classicwowhead. Why do you people insist on using it.
---
It's not against the whole community.
---
I was bloody shocked when I saw the reaction in the German wow forum. Like I did mention, there are very friendly, lovely and open people in World of Warcraft. I made very good friends over the years in this game.
---
But there were always much problems with separation of interests in this community and many players were forced to bow to the minority of those leaders.
---
I'm sad that there was such a harsh reaction with hatred and the movement to say this server X is now our server, with our language, with our rules. That's so wrong in so many ways.
---
I'm sorry for not define the core group of the problem more specific.
---
Flying wasn't a mistake. There was NO mainstream criticism of it during BC.
---
Flying's been the scapegoat for the actual problems with WOW: it got stale, loot lost all prestige, and the content has become progressively worse since WOTLK.
---
Everything gets boring eventually. Mechanically, WOW isn't any different today than it was in 2004. They haven't added any true revolutions to the systems that make the game fundamentally play different. There is no solution to this. At some point, you simply have to make a new game. This is like if id Software had just kept releasing more map packs for Doom instead of making Quake. You HAVE to move on and up the ante at some point.
---
The real motivator for people playing the game was to acquire gear that was time gated in some non trivial way. I raided Naxx during the original game, and I can admit that if it had been possible to get gear that basically looked the same as the Naxx gear did back then without all the guild overhead and bullshit, I absolutely would have not done the time consuming guild. It was a necessary evil. As soon as everyone could essentially get everything with minimal effort, it all became a joke.
---
WOTLK endgame was really the beginning of the end for the game. Anyone could get variations of all the same loot. It was the first time they lazily reused old content instead of actually producing new interesting content (anyone who was actually interested in seeing Naxx could have pugged it during BC).
---
WOW needed some hard and fast rules to really keep the quality high such as "never re-use raids or dungeons." There wasn't a single reused raid or dungeon in BC. They were just consistently pumping out awesome new shit, and lo and behold, BC was when the game grew the most. Going along with this, due to diminishing returns, it just becomes harder and harder to make more amazing loot that's going to really inspire people to dedicate that much time to a game. Where the fuck do you go from Thunderfury? To this day, no other weapon in WOW is as awesome as it. Many people still transmog vanilla and BC sets just because there is no way to up the ante without going into absolutely absurd territory.
---
This all just goes back to the unavoidable conclusion: at some point, you HAVE TO MAKE A NEW GAME. They can't just keep sucking themselves off indefinitely.
---
now adays
---
By simply force locking anyone over a certain level to the "main" layer you can artificially create the zone layering.
---
You're right, fair enough. My point is only that there needs to be a second limiting factor beyond level like time or zone. Not much else though.
---
Can I get an ELI5?
---
Deadzone length is working as intended. It was 11 yards in vanilla for human vs human and is 11 yards in classic for human vs human. The distance is out from the player circle, not from the center of both units.
---
I didn’t expect to get so many replies, but I like this one the best lol thanks 🙂
---
Eh, Blizzard can't really sue the people hosting most of the private servers in remote locations (Like russia, france, etc.) If blizzard fucks up classic you know there is going to be a huge private server release claiming to be more "authentic" and its going to be huge.
---
That’s not the point I’m making, it’s not that I was really playing the game that I hate, it’s that it was a game that I LOVED and it was ruined, and I couldn’t play it because of how it was which made me hate it.  Like imagine you have this drink you love so much that it was the only drink you would drink, and then one day the company puts straight vinegar in it, so now your favorite drink is basically gone because someone decided to fuck it up.  
---
The retail players really have no reason to hate on something that is never really forced on them.  Retail was 100% forced on us depending on when you started disliking it.  
---
Huge difference
---
I certainly didn't, there's no reason to assume we stuck with it.
---
It was pretty similar, actually.
---
But the mana is wasted on beauty products! It's clearly better utilised on a hunter, king of all gear.
---
You realize that that interaction is LITERALLY an example of what people were wanting, right? Like things going off at the same time was a major thing in vanilla, removing it would change the meta and game quite a bit.
---
what is it with the tiny screenshots on this sub
---
Everyone will speak common. It's already in the game. 
---
You got me you bastard.
---
I will never understand why so many people play warriors, they're such a pain in the ass to level.
---
&gt; Idk what took over this community 
---
We've had this stupid discussion before, twice! First when sharding was proposed and right as layering was announced. 
---
Also, 87% is hardly "downvoted", especially considered that the solution misses the use-case of the technology.
---
Zones aren't layered, continents are.
---
It has nothing to do with dungeon finder. It's entirely a lack of solid content and the fundamental game going stale.
---
Correct it should not be resistable in pvp, but on classic beta it can fail in pvp and ALWAYS fails in bgs.
---
Well then think at phase 2 when we are meant to be on 2.5 to 3k only servers. So lets imagine we get perfect population split of the online population so 50/50 and also that its a 3k server.
---
That is 1.5k to 1.5k on the faction now that online population is spread over a number of levels because people may still be leveling so lets so 30% of the population of each faction is level 60 that makes 450 lvl 60 players - at this end point it could become near impossible for people to communicate properly and will basically lead to a bad server experience leading to a server collapsing due to peoples morale dropping because they aren't able to communicate.
---
What are you basing that on?
---
Which didn’t they say would be removed eventually anyway? This is a way to avoid merging 100 servers once the hype and rush dies down. Certainly a flawed system, and I personally would rather them just merge servers, but most people are against that for good reasons.
---
So would you rather layering, or 100 different servers to handle the starting population only to merge most of them a month later? Or ya vote with your wallet and wait till they remove something they already said they will remove
---
Agreed, a lot more needs to be ironed out, that is why I get involved in posts like this where the upvote actually keeps it visible and ppl are discussing possible solutions instead of simply making ultimatums like "I will never play Classic while layering is a thing"
---
It also mitigates the tourist problem. A lot of them wouldnt hit 30 or 40.
---
I lawl'd
---
upvoted for warlock with fiery
---
Damn. The only thing more tragic could be you playing the tiniest violin in this moment.
---
Nein, nicht weil du es blöd findest; sondern weil es da diverse Leute gibt, die nun Deutsch auf einem Server forcieren wollen. Ich finde es traurig, dass man den Mixed-Servern keine Chance gibt und mal schaut wohin es führt. Warum immer gleich mit Kanonen auf Spatzen schiessen?
---
Lass dich doch einfach mal darauf ein und vielleicht ist es alles wesentlich entspannter als erwartet?
---
BTW: Ich konnte kein Wort Englisch damals, ich habe es dank ein paar sehr netten und geduldigen Freunden in WoW gelernt und wir konnten irgendwann verständlich kommunizieren. 
---
Ich denke ich schaue genügend über den Tellerrand und dadurch gebe ich etwas Neuem auch eine Chance und verteufle es nicht direkt ohne Erfahrung damit gesammelt zu haben.
---
People on wow forums complaining about how much wow sucks... If they didn't stick with it, why keep complaining about it?
---
Fear Ward is too good to pass up for the sake of appearances. Alliance Priest is one of the few classes where I think race matters a great deal. It would be better for your raid to have an extra Fear Ward and a good healer than it is to be just a good healer.
---
Scatter shot is DR'ing freezing trap.
---
Holy shock doesn't seem to be triggering the aspect of the cheetah daze effect.
---
Initimidation is not being triggered when the attack absorbs. (Not sure if this is a bug or not, but I could not find anyone mentioning that it would not trigger upon absorbs? The tooltip indicates any successful melee attack i.e. not a miss/parry/dodge)
---
That was a previous season the newer ones are similar to the old style again.
---
Is it worth it though? It seems like the amount of time I'll be spending farming money seems silly just to waste it on a respec
---
It's not just that. It's also the downsizing of everything. It's supposedly an MMO, but there's nothing "massive" about a 10 player raid or even a 25 player raid. 40 is about the lower end of what I'd let someone get away with calling "massive."
---
Fucking Quake 1 multiplayer had 64 player servers.
---
What about 3 days in July? I'm hoping they open it to non active subs. Was so hard to not sub just for the three day stress test
---
If you don't like PvP, don't roll PvP.  I don't care.
---
Yea, theres no perfect solution to it at the end of the day. Everything that could be done has major flaws.
---
Anything they do will be abused by someone unless they go the route of having loads of servers but if they have loads of servers and loads die and they have to merge then its going to negatively hit the communities there.
---
The first time i play retail was in legion, coming from a private servers and jump to lfg  saying "hello hi, how are you? how are we gonna make the dungeon, my first time in retail" nobody say a word EVER in the first 12 dungeons this was so strange for me and i started to think this were only bots. I leave after my subscription was over and never come back... sad because i have played wow in private servers like 6 years and was so hyped about this.
---
If you're lucky, everyone in the raid will use their abilities
---
I'm 12 and what is this
---
7.0 I believe. Or 7.2.
---
I'm not mad, I'm just sad about what happened regarding multi language servers.
---
There's a gnome.  Don't you just want to kill it?  Now you can!
---
Plus grilled squid ;)
---
Going to throw out a middle finger to the dude who even suggested an invite to allow him to layer out.
---
There will be no cap. More ppl want to play on the server, boom new layer.
---
I wish I had friends
---
The macro existed, you just lost your CPs. It's well documented.
---
so if no layering what is the solution to 1-2 mil players wanting to play on day one, week one?
---
As a german person believe me when I say speaking english fluently is not the norm here, quite the opposite. Even people that attend higher education are bad at speaking it fluently, they'll brick together some sentence which you can correctly interpret but it'll take alot of uhs and ahs and still be wrong.
---
It in combination with the melee leeway affects your ability to grind.
---
The sloe is applied after the damage thanks to batching, and the melee leeway makes it hard to stay out if damage range for frost nova. So it has a lot to do with it.
---
Nah that was sharding, but people hated that so Blizzard changed it, lol.
---
Simple, they love wow.
---
When you're passionate about something, you'll be early to speak out about faults it has
---
Nah, subs held until Cataclysm. 
---
Cataclysm was simply crap. It was a complete misfire. 
---
They arrogantly thought that they could just keep growing the game (focusing on leveling content), but the truth was that the game had peaked, and instead of hanging onto what they had by pumping out awesome end game content, they greedily left them out to dry and tried to keep pumping in more players.
---
They were so arrogant that they thought they could shortchange endgame/existing customers and get away with it.
---
&gt; Lol there was
---
I'm wondering this too
---
PVE servers turn the game into co-op only. There's really no reason to ever care about the other half of your realm's playerbase at all.
---
PVP servers turn the game into a competition. There's every reason to care about the other faction because they can affect your gameplay and you can affect theirs.
---
This means that every single accomplishment on a PVP server is weighted more heavily than the same accomplishment on a PVE server.
---
You are aware that completing some quests unlocks quests from other NPCs that would otherwise never show up? You dont tell a sub full of noobs to skip quests without explaining that. Unless youre a dick head.
---
&gt;Once a character hits level 15 or 20, the character will no longer be layered.
---
Leveling is a massive wave that moves up through the levels.
---
This is why layering is time from launch and not level based.
---
I think anyone with an active sub can post on the beta forums
---
Correct. This entire fuckfest of outrage is about one to three months layering.
---
Getting to the instance through the elites out front requires a group.
---
Congrats at turning a tongue in cheek comment into a pissing contest.
---
the thing is , Blizzard spend almost a year sending positive signal to the player . 
---
" The game as you remember it . Hard , but rewarding . and built around a strong interaction between players . "
---
And now this ... 
---
And don't get me wrong , i don't have any issue with player in the US . And i'm glad they don't face this kind of issue . But for a lot of what i see here , they should stop judging people outside North america and looking at them from above . 
---
I have to much faith in human nature , but they should take our side . If everyone speak from 1 voice , thing can change . This choice from blizzard impact EU , but want will prevent blizzard from making a bad choice for North American player in the future ? And maybe when this day will come , they will be happy to have EU player to support them
---
Unless you get to Naxx levels of block value your damage won’t be enough.
---
If you do your shield slam crits will actually be enough that you’ll kill people
---
I'm seriously having second thoughts.   If they don't fix hunters by launch I'm not going to waste my time.  That's all I want to play.
---
I'm disappointed that after the announcement a firestorm broke out, without reflecting what the real consequences of the decision really can be or will be.
---
Why not giving it a chance? Why not provide ideas like language specific global chat channels? Why force a server to a specific language?
---
Wish you also all the best!
---
I wasn't aware that once you create a character on one server you can't create a character on another one ever.
---
Retail is far harder than vanilla ever was. Where are your mythic raid achievements? Yeah, that's what I thought.
---
The real problem is that you can have the same gear with a different color as a mythic raider by queuing up for LFR and watching Seinfeld while monitoring the game in the corner of your eye.
---
Atleast you have mates :(
---
I feel like you should do your homework. Damage is applied before slows with spell batching. So this is my point.
---
Rather than br a jerk about it why dont you try explaining next time since that is the purpose of my question.
---
Oooo nice. It's good to see them fixing things like this. Hopefully they get around to the melee problems next.
---
You need to edit this comment to remove that name and OP might need to upload a cropped version without realm name.
---
I had a comment removed on this sub for mentioning a pserver by name
---
Poor Omar, if only he knew how bad things would turn out.
---
Are you really bashing on someone for their english? lol, are you twelve? Might not be his first language.
---
No, a lot of players will drop off as they level and reduce time played. The first day/week is the crazy rush. So by level 25 or so you can have all of them on one main layer.
---
Well we had 20 man raids like Zul Gurub in Classic. I'm definitely in favor of a 40 man raid here and there, but I'd be okay if it's just one raid every 2 years.
---
Thank you for this useful post.
---
As an Eastern European, this whole situation is honestly weird to me.   
---
Like, why would anyone want to play the game in anything but its "original" language, especially their native language?    
---
If, for some reason, I was only able to play the game in my native language (through some Blizz-enforced geoblocking), I would just not play it all.   
---
English is not my first language, not even second (which would be Russian). It's my third. I know some French and Spanish well. But my native language is "mundane", the language in which I work and deal with other responsibilities in life... you know - the things I play to escape.    
---
I also don't understand how someone would want to play a game they cannot understand anything in. Sure there's some initial fun/novelty, but it would soon wear off imo.
---
You forgot the completely broken pets.
---
Please show me where you can see a server population day one. Or even day 7. 
---
You won’t know a servers population until days, probably weeks after launch. 
---
How can you tell a servers population before people even hit max level? You judge it off the level 1 zone? Tell me your secret to knowing something you don’t know.
---
Thats like having your grandpa die from natural causes and claim you killed him.
---
I live in Skåne and I wish we were part of Denmark instead of Sweden with all the criminality that grows stronger everyday. Malmö is a shitshow
---
It seems more like they added an artificial delay as opposed to properly implementing batching. Keep in mind they aren't even using the original client anymore. [Check out this clip](https://clips.twitch.tv/TransparentGrotesqueMallardYouWHY).
---
Proof plz.
---
1. Might deter solo players, or at least the ones that don't have a second account
---
2. Moving a character to whichever desired zone is easy enough, could even just have characters in all high level zones
---
3. Too intrusive and could backfire also, i.e. you're in combat and your friend, who is at the same location, can't join you to help
---
I don't think there's a single set of restrictions past what there is now that would both meet Blizzards criteria of elegance and immersion while also being foolproof. 
---
There's varying degrees to which they could obscure the layer systems exploitability , but I can't see it ever becoming truly foolproof without being horribly intrusive and counter intuitive
---
Underrated comment.
---
Thankyou for offering an actual link to help explain. I can't believe how toxic this community is.
---
Maybe. Seems like it would work better with the flagging system rather than being forced to fight no matter what.
---
I didn’t, just throwing some crap math at you. That’s up to you if it’s worth it or not to respec twice a week. There are certainly people that do, but I focus on epic mount/pre raid BiS/consumables before I throw around 50-100g per week on respecs. I wouldn’t say it’s a waste though if you really want to play 2 different specs.
---
Vipersting
---
&gt;Also it is an element of elitist for the English/British
---
And also everyone from smaller countries that wouldn't get their own realm anyway
---
Nothing you described is spell batching. Just go read up on what spell batching actually is.
---
Sure, but they're good tanks throughout the leveling stage and obviously very good (and fun imo) at level 60. They're very satisfying to play in a way I feel like.
---
If you don't like pvp then don't play a pvp server, it's not really that big a deal.
---
Also depends how many friends you got joining you. Rolling with a squad feels a lot more fun than doing it solo dolo
---
But that's my whole point. ZG wasn't a "real" raid.
---
ZG was the original game's version of "casual" content. Fewer players, smaller stakes, worse loot.
---
If anything, they should have actually kept going in the massive direction. Even crazier raids that required 80 players that dropped even better loot that was exclusive to it. That could have even been an alternative to increasing the player cap. Instead of increasing the player cap, you basically just keep upping the number of required players.
---
Subs who lack human interaction or are afraid to show their sub side irl, so they get off by being a sub "healer", by putting everyone above themselves.  
---
I've always found it strange, I feel like healing is more of a dom thing, you decide who lives and who dies, who is worthy of your time and who isn't, etc.
---
Hating on the game since Cata, as some here have stated, indicates to me they simply don't like it.
---
I have issues with the game. I state them clearly. I don't simply say "wow sucks" as a lot of people do these days. I'm not happy with BfA. It's been my least favorite expansion, but I don't generalize about WoW.
---
As far as classic, I miss a lot of the old systems and I'm definitely going to mess around with it, but I'm not going to shit on retail like it's the enemy.
---
Yeah his thoughts on itemization are another key point that I really appreciate his thoughts on. I feel like he very concisely outlines why modern items suck.
---
Take my upvote, only ones not liking this are retail babies
---
Hard or flaccid?
---
Can you name just one thing that he did which made you dislike him?
---
layering so unclassic it hurts, remove that garbage already
---
Are you really trying to bash me for saying "10s" instead of "tens"
---
Same here the only reason I am going to check out his steam is so I know what server to stay away from.
---
Dat car responsibility.
---
&gt; Does druids actually do this?
---
Yes they are actually only in the raid for motw, decursing and faerie fire
---
Ya it's really incredible how misunderstood development, especially game development, is. 
---
And I admit I was one of those people before I became a developer. But I know now...and yikes
---
It's not that I want to play 2 specs, it's that I'm assuming that my guild would make me play 2 specs since shadow priest is a meme in pve.
---
It is the residual from the May Stress test so ppl can uninstall it easier.
---
That chairs seem not so comfy than real gaming chairs. Are they?
---
How does the opposite faction affect the others gameplay on a PvP server outside of ganking?
---
exactly, or protective, which is also a dom trait.
---
Oof... I played until Naxx with 256 ram (32 vram)... it was horrible. Any flightpaths meant a disconnect. Entering Ironforge - disconnect. Daring to look up from the floor in IF? - disconnect. HS? - disconnect. 
---
Upgrading to 1gb was the best feeling in my life at that point.
---
Life isn’t a competition mate, you’re the star of your own show! I’m sure you worked hard for everything you have and earned it. Keep grinding my man
---
Of course research went into private servers, but they worked with incomplete information and cannot be trusted as a reference really. Things like hit rate, mob health, boss abilities in dungeons, raid trash spawn positions, sit-crits, etc etc were all wrong. Theres so much that people called out because it didnt match private servers that were proven to be wrong compared to the authentic classic build. We simply cant value private server info above blizzard
---
Thanks for the heads up.
---
If only they cared about other ToS breaking things and not just dead private servers.
---
How can you even tolerate seeing someone on the opposite faction and just walking past them? That would ruin the game for me.
---
2/10
---
I hope Blizzard comes out soon and talks about their plans for layering. Preferably before people begin to eat themselves.
---
That’s weird because it wasn’t there before. It just showed up like a day or two before the new stress test.
---
Pretentious and cringe
---
You don’t have it.
---
LF server which becomes 95% german, czech, spanish etc. a week into live servers.
---
As much as I hate rogues they do seem very interesting to play. Both in PvE and PvP which is rare.
---
Thanks for pointing this out. I can see what you mean.
---
But I think the language barrier is overrated on multiple levels:
---
\- Nowadays we can translate on the fly something we don't know
---
\- A very big part of the community can speak basic English
---
\- Gaming is a good aggregator to learn and get used to a language
---
But let this aside, why not give it a chance? Let the numbers speak when it is online and we can observe it. Blizzard have no intention to destroy the community or kill classic ASAP. And by any means they are not stupid neither they decided this on the fly.
---
How would this deter solo players? Users with a second account would not be able to reliably abuse the layering system.
---
Having a character in a high level zone would not help. You still won't be able to choose your layer.
---
Layering gives preference to those in your guild and on your friend's list, so it's likely you'll be on the same Layer already. If not, it's really your fault for knowingly being in two different Layers and refusing to group up.
---
the server creates batches of actions (attacks, buffs, debuffs, etc) in order to process them all together.
---
From wowhead.
---
Yeah I know that. As the play button hasn’t lit up. I was wondering as to why it was even there.
---
it has everything to do with the dungeon finder. You would have the same damn experience in Classic if they made a dungeon finder for it. The dungeon finder CREATES that lack of solid content. It devalues the dungeon experience.
---
This is how I see it tbh. I think i would really enjoy open world PvP if ganking wasnt a thing. Id take the slower leveling and the deaths because Im simply shittier than the other player and that's my fault. Some asshole waiting until i have 10% health and finishing me off or a bored level 60 ruins the fun of open world PvP.
---
Seasons 3-11 were the golden years
---
Play a NE. There will be other Dwarf priests in your raid to provide fear ward and Horde manage to raid without FW. Only idiot min/maxers demand that you play a Dwarf priest. The sort of people who insist you play a specific race are the people you don't want to play with anyway.  
---
Every normal person is simply happy to have a priest of *any* race around and will love you if you are a good one.
---
Lol there are so many bugs...
---
At this point I will probably wait until layering gets turned off before I start playing.
---
No, retail is harder in terms of mechanical skill. That isn't the "hard" I was talking about. 
---
You're talking about hard as in, only a few percent of people are skilled enough to be heart surgeons. 
---
I'm talking about the hard of brutal time in the face of hard work. 
---
Both have value, and I'd personally love if classic evolves into incorporating both, with horizontal progression instead of vertical, as WoW originally took. As well as not introducing those convenience features.
---
The batches of actions from what i have read is applying the debuff slow from mage spells after the damage. In a separate batch.
---
Is oculus the one where you ride dragons? That one was only hard because people were idiots who didn't bother to learn the mechanics for the last fight.   If you had a group with even decent awareness and communication, it wasn't a challenge. 
---
HoL was legit tough, agreed.
---
For me it is the sense of danger, everywhere all the time. The adrenaline rush when you see an enemy not knowing if they will attack you or you will both just run past each other. It is a feeling I was not able to get in any game. You need to be always aware of your surroundings, it is so rewarding.
---
Do we know delivsaur patterns will be in at launch?
---
Just got off work so you can get your cut. Cringe! Haha
---
I wouldn't call it more casual. The raid was harder than MC for the most part. It was just easier to organize 20 people than 40. And you could've just divide your 40 man raid group into 2 ZG raid groups.
---
I think they generally should have sticked with 10, 20 and 40 man raids with the slight majority being 20 mans. 
---
I was a raid leader back in vanilla and coordinating 40 man was a pain in the ass. We've spent 30 minutes just to assign targets on Garr (that was before you could mark targets).
---
Because faction pride doesn't mean anything to me. I just want to do my thing and let other people do theirs.
---
There is a beta going on for classic right now.
---
You could always pick a week or two to focus on PvP/PvE. Maybe your schedule won’t let you raid and instead you can respec once and PvP all week. Next week switch back for raids and you can still try out healing for PvP.
---
Hi, /u/its2020youguys
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c3ucg1/only_13_of_voters_think_international_servers_is/). 
---
I really think they should make a single server without layering, that way I could laugh about all of you idiots, while you wait in a never-ending queue, with a perpetually crashing server. 
---
Call it "Purgatory" or something. It's a win/win.
---
The archaeologists of the future will write masters theses on the intricacies and aesthetic values of this shit
---
But how come I now have the beta version in my account. It wasn’t there originally. Only the stress test.
---
So where is the problem? He avoided getting ganked and went on with is day without retards fucking up his fun. Sounds alright to me.
---
Ive got a group of 5. We were really hyped to play on a PvP server until trying it on a 'server' and now only 1 of us still wants to roll PvP.
---
WHAT THE FUCK.  THAT’S A FUCKING FIFTY DEE KAY PEE MINUS!!!
---
&gt; Because faction pride doesn't mean anything to me.
---
Me neither. But then you're just playing a game where some of the people you run into are people you can't group with. They're not technically enemies, it's just something you can't do. That makes it feel like something is wrong with the game.
---
No. Because this is r/wow. Listing why I have an issue with a person outside of WoW probably won’t be allowed here.
---
Poor crybaby, strange people were mean to you and hurt your nana feelings over pc game? If you get offended and disgusted by people behavior over anonymous internet, you should seriously consider stepping up your confidence and stop being little beta female
---
Also fury/prot warriors tanking while dual wielding. Focusing on getting the required weapon skill cap to not lose dps from glancing on melee classes, as well as hit and getting crit capped.
---
Hype is leveling out, folks are just itching to get in, not watch people stream it. Streamers are getting locked from the level cap and the huge looming fact that any progress they make is gone with the beta. 
---
It’ll pick up a bit with increasing level caps but imo it’s about to dwindle to hardcore testers looking for those niche bugs like the hunter bow sound being off etc that I’ve seen. (Bless them for their work)
---
I just hope too many don’t go to private servers to scratch the itch and burn out before launch
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/?quest=1947](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=1947)   
---
\^ This quest leads to a good +spell damage wand. It's DPS is decent too if you do it at level appropriate ranges. At 60 you'll be able to go to Dire Maul East and do the Mage quest for level 55 conjured water. The level 50 Mage quest may also be in for Sunken Temple, which also gives a good reward for the level. The other Mage quests are up to you, and don't give anything incredible. If you're interested, here is a list of all the Mage quests:  
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/?quests=4.-161](https://classicdb.ch/?quests=4.-161)
---
ahahah no.
---
ACTIVISION didn't create the solid content. That's the problem. 
---
No one wanted to play some lazy ass repurposing of Deadmines. They wanted more solid original content. Activision got cheap and lazy, and the game got worse. It's that simple.
---
Yeah. Im starting to believe all of the PvP server bullying is empty. Sounds like there is absolutely no benefit for someone who isnt interested.
---
Hah. You think thats bad? For me it says in Version: Live - World of Warcraft Classic. In Developement: Beta-World of Warcraft Classic
---
The other day I flew to the Hinterlands.  Me and my friend were the only players out there.  I asked him for some water.
---
He wasn't in my layer.
---
It's mostly just flavour. It's not a meaningful ability when compared to things like escape artist/stoneform/perception.
---
Mom is definitely BiS item
---
Just be glad theres no oil in azeroth
---
I don't think anyone denies that private servers have some data wrong, but that doesn't make them completely unreliable. Blizzard just needs to cross check their reference client as well. If something in beta doesn't match private servers, it's at least worth investigating. Private servers got a lot wrong, but got even more right. Why not use 15+ years of research to our advantage?
---
Christ, this takes purism to a whole new level.
---
Same, I don’t think that’s the case because the only issue is while people are sharing the same zone. Even if you project to have 100% of retention at level 60 (which will never happen), it’s not an issue because a big part of the content lvl 60 is in instances, which is, by design, a way to Manage the population. 
---
And even during the opening of AQ or silithus farm, it has never been an issue to have lot’s of people in the zone
---
Do mobs have Agility / Strength? 
---
submitted 2 hours ago by fpsdredd
---
Does anyone know if mobs have Agility or Strength stat in classic? If so, can you cite a source?
---
​
---
Curious minds want to know.
---
Yes they do I dont need a source because if this wasn't the case wed have a lot of useless debuffs
---
PvP servers have that extra edge for me with that always looking over your shoulder feeling.
---
I don't have a ton of experience as mage, but my concern would be putting that many points into Frost but not getting Ice Block
---
Ok, so you've read the words but you don't understand them.
---
Spell batching is an archaic system vanilla used to compensate for lag. Its what allowed a Mage to be spell locked out of the Arcane tree while also getting off his polymorph.
---
Here is how it works. You cast Polymorph, the other mage casts Polymorph. The casts are so close together that the game "batches" them together and they happen simultaneously despite the fact that maybe you casted sooner or faster.
---
Now, you're saying somehow Blizzard's slow effect gets batched and happens after the damage? Thats not how batching works or what batching is, and isn't a thing that happens in the game. The slow effect does not happen before or after the damage, it happens simultaneously as the effects are all part of the spell.
---
Two opposite-faction raids getting ready to zone in for the evening will result in a large PVP battle, potentially forcing one team to lose their World Buffs. This inherently makes raiding on a PVP server more difficult than a PVE server.
---
Not all PVP battles are "ganks". You will run across opposite-faction members of the same level in many zones because that's how the game is designed. In a PVP realm, this means potential dangerous competition in an otherwise fair environment. In a PVE realm, it means no difference than running into someone of your own faction besides the fact that you cannot communicate effectively or group with them.
---
Play classic and make some new ones!
---
I honestly have no idea what you're making fun of... sounds like you're backing up my point
---
I wouldnt be able to joke about Loriot (Vicko van Bülow), Otto Waalkes, Nico Semsrott, german dub of Spongebob Schwammkopf which is a lot different than the english.
---
You see where I'm coming from? I wouldn't be able to talk to the right audience in PuGs, because they arent as familiar with german comedians and culture.
---
Nah. Retail mythic raiding is far more time consuming than raiding during vanilla ever was. 
---
The game at the highest level is harder today than it was at the highest level then.
---
Same, always postponed eating til after the next dungeon or bg or herb node.
---
Back in Wrath, I raided with a girl named Kate. We'd occasionally sing this song on Ventrilo together.
---
The only good thing about Classic is that it will allow for more authentic private servers. 
---
No private server player is gonna pay $15 for a broken game when they can a play far more authentic server for free.
---
[A bit more than just the first line.](https://xkcd.com/359/)
---
&gt; I hate this blame SJW bullshit. I hear it all the time and I don't think I've ever had an interaction where someone was a raging feminist/PC police.
---
They're inside the corporations, making the decisions to hire women writers who don't play games, among other decisions. 
---
&gt; Mostly I blame the capitalist mindset. Studios are now run by the shareholders instead of the artists and they want money over everything. How do you appeal to as many people as possible? Dumb it down and make it easy.
---
This doesn't work. Get woke, go broke. If these corporations were capitalist, the last thing they'd want is to push SJW ideology, the masses don't want to game. 
---
Also, the stock market and laws necessitating public corps. to maximize shareholder profit, that has nothing to do with capitalism. It's a law, not the free market. One of the worst laws on the books. If you invest with a company by buying its stock, you should do due diligence and learn about the company. You shouldn't have any legal enforcement of maximal profits. Retarded. 
---
&gt; And you blame it on women liking story more than action? Give me a break.
---
Oh no, that's just part of it. This appeal to casuals is part of the SJW mindset, appeal to the lowest common denominator, which they are. Most people are stupid.
---
1000 a month for a room? The fuck do u stay at the hilton?
---
Some guy answered you already, it's from the last stress test.
---
Indeed!
---
If your point is about group think and lazy circle jerking, then yea I get that. Reddit as a whole is pretty garbage in that regard. Is it just me, or DAE hate Trump? xD
---
Oh no, now I HAVE to aoe grind on my mage. Been trying it out on pservers and finally got the hang of it.
---
I mained forsaken priest in vanilla, I'll probably roll human this time. I'll miss canabalize more than wotf.
---
Decent mods/the ability to set markers in a dungeon would exponentially reduce the amount of time it took to set up any vanilla raid.
---
Don't you have a phone?
---
The entire point of layering is that each layer acts as a server cap worth of population. 
---
What you are suggesting is sharding, and I am assuming they are way past the point of no return on that front.
---
Streamer servers will be that, you are in luck.
---
interesting.  Well, did you try this on a well established P server? Cause that experience is gonna be MUCH different than classic. Kids wont have level 60s, or gear, or time to be out chasing lowbie characters.  For the first month, the most dangerous thing youll face will be someone 10 levels higher than you maybe. Youre not gonna be getting chased down by a full T2 hunter with Lok'delar. So keep that in mind when you make your decision
---
But that already deleted. Why would it get added again. I guess it just doesn’t make sense.
---
So it’s just irrational hatred.
---
So as a Hungarian which server am I supposed to join? Which server will let me speak my own language in trade chat? The whole realm for each country idea is retarded. Just speak English.
---
Not for me. I've played WoW for 7 years and the only enjoyable experience I have ever had in PvP was raiding capital cities which is still going to be a thing in PvP servers. I see absolutely no benefit in getting into fights while questing or gathering resources. If I want to fight, I will put myself into a situation that gets me fights.
---
The issue is that he, much like many others, don't understand what layering is meant to do.  
---
If they have layering, and a server is full and has 5+ layers (no idea what the final number will be), then those 'full' layers cannot be removed on a whim, especially not in the same month of release.
---
No it isn't. You can easily buy the mats you need, and raids are not 40 man anymore.
---
Besides, I'm not only focusing on raiding. That's a small component of the overall package. Leveling is a huge part of the game in classic.
---
Pingaan my dude, this is amazing. You're insane for setting up such a big and comprehensive guide and additionally handing it out for free! Now I and thousands of others can spare a lot of time. Thank you so much!
---
As you want Feedback: There are quite some item-links missing in the Equipment &amp; enchants tab (looked specifically at Prot Warrior). It's probably a formatting issue because it only appears when there are alternative Items listed.
---
You think you do, but you don't.
---
I'm not talking about contested zones. I am talking about griefing. Someone going into zones specifically because they like to annoy other players-and also people that go to those zones specifically to protect others from griefers. Yea, it's not exactly a nice thing to do, and it's not exactly the most fun thing to have happen to you, but as I mentioned it's part of the game. It has certain effects on people and causes other interesting things to happen that won't be possible if layers are level locked.
---
Yeah i touched on this. This isn't fun when getting ganked.
---
You do you cricket, you do you.
---
Back facts. Have an updoot
---
And that is why i posted this thread about, so why not explain instead of posting a completely unhelpful post at all. Why even waste your time commenting if you werent going to contribute to the discussion on the first place.
---
Thank you for your explanation, maybe try opening with that next time. It has been very helpful.
---
Do you have a solution that isn’t “making more servers” that allows the game to be playable day 1 by everyone? If not, then you can’t actually be against layering.
---
You're really doubling down when you shouldn't. Layering is seperating the server into several parallel worldspaces, the entire open world at once. That's what makes it layering as opposed to sharding or some other kind of load balancing. 
---
I don't know why it's so hard for you to accept. You're just flat out insulting me and claiming I'm making ad hominems when I'm not because you don't have a rebuttal. I really recommend you read up on the technology before you get into an argument about. I'm not going to hold any of this against you because people react badly when their pride is wounded, especially if it's over the internet, but there's not point in engaging anymore if you don't have the background knowledge required. I'll just leave it at this
---
Sounds like California tbh
---
&gt; what about the adult community the wow has?
---
Some of them never learned English at school. East Germans learned Russian instead of English, for instance. Same for older Polish and Czech gamers. 
---
Some learned it in school but haven't used it since. Yes, these people exist. WoW-gamers in Germany (at least today) skew heavily towards the unenducated, usually never went to high school (Abitur). 
---
Good luck getting these people to subscribe to your game when you're basically giving them homework.
---
## you're a chesticle graduate.
---
[beep boop im a bot with no intelligence to give a fuck about your life so I guess Ill just shoot a shitty comment at you hehe]
---
Yeah, that's something to think about. Do you think all guilds will really be that anal about 1 spriest?
---
I know you're really bad at the game bro but it won't make a difference to my guild and I because content will be cleared on the same day it would be regardless. But keep cry cos blizzard are used to listening to casuals
---
Lets get back to the original comment. Yes we should investigate potential faultiness absolutely. But OG comment was throwing a punch towards people saying that Blizz has the right numbers while we (and private servers) don't. 
---
This is true so of course ill comment. Blizz has a reference client and while people can absolutely have reason from private server references to have Blizz look into stuff, Blizz still holds the correct information and theres plenty of instances where people report private server differences that were faulty compared to the OG vanilla build. I simply don't think the original commenter had proper reasoning behind him.
---
As long as you joke with me about Weihnachten bei Hoppenstets  seeing how Opa wants to listen to Marschmusik and Dicki cant be arsed to be festive I will play on your english server.
---
Oh? You dont know german comedy? 
---
A big part of a german/british/spanish server is talking with people about stuff of your country.
---
I do remember sprinting rogues just being all over the place while attacking you, but I know I always assumed this was from lag.
---
Pserver players play for end game. 1.12 is eternally Warrior fotm. So much so that the epeen from warrior players is injected into the value of their real life.
---
The core pserver player only sees the game through numbers and play a meta nobody "returning" to play Classic understand. Nothing is new to them. There is no nostalgia. They live within the meta and memes of the pserver Wow core. They are static in their view as is the case with any game that's been out for a long time.
---
Classic will be slightly different with a more diverse player base ... at the beginning. Then the static nature of the game will lead to exactly what happened on pservers. This is why Classic can't remain static forever. I am not suggesting change for launch or anywhere near after launch until long standing metrics prove to Blizzard that the health of the game will suffer in the long run due to being locked into a patch so unbalanced.
---
The game will sadly turn into exactly what is seen on this reddit's discord. You get one GM spouting how warriors are the only class required for raiding. That entire raids should be 90% warriors and openly state your value as a human being for choosing a less optimized raiding class.
---
Yeah that definitely didn't happen during vanilla and even on private servers it doesn't always work. High risk, high reward.
---
Thats called a stress test and they've done a couple. Notably the last one in which every server had different layering values to do exactly that.
---
No kidding... most people who actually played vanilla or even TBC likely wouldn't give a flying crap over having the first 2-3 days being rough to progress.
---
It is insane to me that people whine over 2-3 days for that instant gratification, but have no problem having a feature much longer term that has been repeatedly proven to be very damaging to the game over extended periods of time.
---
I mean I said I have reasons and I said what those reasons are. You can look them up if you want. But sure. Irrational.
---
Ask people hosting servers in eastern europe what they think about your major lawsuits
---
Yeah pretty much this.
---
Thank you, I added them to the list.
---
You make that sound any better? "im sad cause i got btfo in an online discussion, guess im going to throw a bitch fit".
---
Chill out dude
---
Wow thank you very much. Gonna take a close look at all those quests
---
PvP isn't your cup of tea and that's fine. Those who say you're missing half the game by not rolling on a PvP server have their head too far up their own asses. The only thing you will be missing is getting ganked, corpse camped, the chance to get the jump on someone, or the possibility of missing out on large scale WPvP battles. Personally, I like the extra chance of running across the enemy faction. It can be friendly coexisting or a slaughter depending on how they react. There's nothing wrong with not enjoying that extra layer of potential conflict.  
---
People will still attack quest givers, quest hubs, and Capital Cities on PvE servers. You'll find the occasional flagged player to engage with, but more often than not you'll simply ignore the enemy faction.
---
Yes you’re right the ones which filter out kanji does it by checking the characters and if it’s not in the ascii it will disable it.
---
Making an add on which filters out languages for example French would work like this: the add on loads a French vocabulary compares the text and if the words match it filters it. However it would have problems like similar words which would then require to scan the whole input (abbreviations could cause problems too) it’s just messy

Apres je parle pas anglais au taf , mais meme en dehors de ca , WoW c'est sensé etre un plaisir. Et devoir galerer a communiquer avec des non francophones dans un anglais incertain ... 
---
Et l'impact sur les serveurs va etre enorme . 
---
J'aimerai bien faire un peu de PVE HL dans quelques mois . Refaire MC ou BWL comme a l'epoque . Meme refaire la quete epique du chasseur ! Mais si les serveurs sont multilangues , il va y avoir une population anglaise , allemande , espagnol , francaise etc qui ne se melangeront pas vraiment . Donc moins de joueur possible a recruter pour gonfler les rosters des guildes . 
---
Et avec des raid a 40 joueurs , il faudra au moins 60 gars dans chaques guildes voulant raid vraiment . La population du jeu a vieilli , on a pour beaucoup 30 ans passé , des gosses , un taf .. une vie . Difficile d'avoir tout le monde dispo tout les soirs ( et pas forcement la motivation non plus ) 
---
Meme simplement pour discuter avec des gens sympas . et passer un bon moment . Devoir trouver des astuces , genre " Le Serveur X sera celui ou les FR doivent venir " ... c'est n'importe quoi . 
---
Et la je parle meme pas des gens aimant faire du RP . 
---
Au final c'est juste une decision de merde , que blizzard ne justifie en rien ( " C'est la meilleur solution " n'est pas un argument ) , et qui va gacher le plaisir en partie a pas mal de monde . Et c'est stupide . Mettre autant d'energie a faire quelquechose jusque la au petit oignons ( j'ai un acces beta , le jeux est " how it should be " croyez moi ) pour gacher la fete et se mettre des batons dans les roue 2 mois avant la sortie .
---
This is actually pretty basic, and just a regular function of beta testing. Is your purpose just to gripe people for giving a fuck?
---
What do you think about BC and WOTLK servers with the ability to copy paste your classic characters? Merge the classic realms if there is a drop in players and maintain the level 60 experience for anyone who wishes to stay there?
---
Yea, in the starter zones in week 1 it was tough for vanilla, but once it settled and you got to the second zone, it was easy.  Also, vanilla launch was made worse because they sold 500k extra copies accidentally when they didn't have the servers to hold anywhere near that many people.
---
Launch wasn't as bad as some of you 'think'.  If you actually experienced it, then you would know you were still able to progress, even through the lag and competition.  It is about getting over the first hurdle (starting area) and then it is smooth sailing in groups.
---
Hybrid builds do work, but you're probably better off with Ice Block + Blast Wave instead of Imp Counterspell. People call it an Elemental build and the goal is to use fire spells with Shatter to rack up Ignites and kill people quickly. Someone more experienced with Mages than I am can explain specifics.

There has been no official statement on Leeway as a whole, and it's been an entire month since my post [Retail Melee Leeway Mechanic on Beta]9https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bs7ks2/melee_leeway_retail_mechanic_in_classic/)

Except you will now play on servers in which 60%+ (in reality probably more like 90% on unofficial x-nationality servers) of your server might as well be bots, because they will simply not talk to you, making them pretty much NPCs for you.
---
Because I’m TBC, flying was exclusive to rich max-level players and only in a minority of the game’s map
---
Flying is absolutely, undeniably, a problem. It’s a small problem compared to what the game suffers from, but it’s a problem
---
While yeah, people who give streamers (or anyone famous really) an excessive amount of money / gifts just to feel some kind of acceptance are what I'd consider cringy. I don't think it's fair to say that streamers are ruining the game. Its the people who follow them that are the bigger problem. Many streamers even the ones you may hate do good things for the game. Content creation, even if it's reaction videos is something that brings in more discussion, more advertising/popularity for the game and keeps the game relevant.  
---
While I wish that more "content creators" were creating content that was of higher quality e.g well edited discussion videos, pvp/pve videos, machinima etc instead of just streams and podcasts. That issue isn't just limited to WoW, it's happening everywhere because people realized they can get paid the same amount if not more by lazily sitting in front of a camera and talking every now and then.  
---
And yeah, streaming does still requires effort and you need to be good at talking to make money. But once you've built that following and are comfortable you're in a position where you can make boatloads of money with little effort. So why would you switch to pushing out a few \~10minute videos that require research and a bunch of editing which takes just as much time as streaming for a few days, is more tiring and makes you less money?  
---
Anyway back to the point of people who watch streamers making the game worse for everyone, I do agree that they're making it worse for players when a hoard of "followers" runs through a zone or makes a server lag out It's really not going to happen that much to each individual player that it's going to make a big impact. Probably the biggest issue would be if it starts to affect the realms economy. One person being handed extra gold or free raid loot is annoying in the sense that it feels unfair but it's not going to ruin the game for anyone. A whole servers economy being ruined because a streamer got all their followers to farm a certain thing definitely could but even then I doubt it would happen to such an extent that it was extremely detrimental to players.  
---
I guess the other issue would just be that people who follow streamers around everywhere tend to be really obnoxious and it could lower your enjoyment of the game while those people were online. But either way I don't think it will really affect individual players that much, I mean how often are you going to run into a hoard of followers following a streamer around?
---
Yeah I'm not trying to get into fights outside of raid entrances. Its enough of a hassle getting 20 people on retail to show up for a raid when everyone has jobs and shit. Double that and make things take longer because of deaths outside the raid? No thanks.
---
I dont know about level 60 zones. I'd assume that the higher level you are, the more fair the fights will be. But as far as leveling, its literally just ganks. The competition just doesn't mean anything to me. I like to look at the game as a collective and not split. Id rather help the opposite faction finish off a mob they are dying to over killing them.

I feel like there needs to be a sticky thread or something. This gets posted once every 20 minutes.

isn't this video showing the center of both units (as it were, since it's only one guy)? so it would be 11 yards center-to-center, 8 yards with combat reach included? (human vs human)
---
there are a couple offhands with armor, if you want to look at those.
---
I agree, getting ganked is no fun but keeps you aware and not auto-piloting playing vs mobs. PVP server add a certain level of game-play. It truly keeps you engaged and emotional. I like when a game gets me emotional otherwise why even play?
---
Priests have a better spirit calculation - so yeah you normally give it to a priest, they will literally get more mana back from it if you both have equal gear.
---
Then they changed it in TBC...and it got even more popular.
---
Nobody wanted PHASING.  
---
The sharding we saw at blizzcon had resources phasing, players constantly phasing, and it looked and felt horrible.  
---
If they could have a system that mixes layering and sharding together for the first zone, but not force phasing to happen in front of people's eyes, then very few people would have an issue with it.  That wasn't the suggestion back then though, and it wasn't what we were shown or what was discussed.
---
The numbers I've seen thrown around are anywhere between 170 to 240 hours
---
My favorite version of this is kiting Omen to Orgrimmar. He has a continue AOE around him that is absolute death to bank alts.
---
Why can't one do both? I've done my spreadsheets as well and I'm still joining my kid on his activities and later, when he is old enough I'll include him in gaming.
---
Technically, Vanilla WoW isn't the biggest MMO in history. It had much lower launch day numbers than every expansion and lower peak player counts than many of them.
---
Yeah I thought about that as well. It'll probably be fine for the first characters since we have an entire group to kill anyone who we come across but for alts its going to suck. Also, they are all taking time off of work so the entire days of a full squad are limited.
---
Something like this. It never felt like the first few years in wow. ever. the last xpac i played for 2 weeks before giving up.  accessibility, lack of a community, the feel of a mobile gaming exp killed it for good.
---
Hey zero is one of my names. But ya, I forgot about the 2 weeks. There is no way I’m not getting a couple, I have a bunch.
---
If they had any faith in classic what so ever, or intention to support it as much as possible, then they wouldn't even need layering.
---
Well the artist is wrong.
---
And hopefully you'll make sense in the future, but hey thanks for backing me up on this.
---
Still.
---
Crushing blow resulting in a full raid wipe, only 1 viable tank spec among 3-4 tank specs, Threat meters being the only managable thing dps needs to keep an eye on= Good raid design 
---
Team coordination, no RNG mechanics resulting in unfair wipes, everyone has a purpose and a role= bad raid design
---
Again.
---
DAE CLASSIC GOOD
---
BFA BAD
---
BET YOU DON'T EVEN LIKE GRIZZLY HILLS
---
Thank u, finally someone who understands what this is about. 
---
Even english realms will be better if there are language specific ones because this means on the english ones are players who have chosen to do so.
---
Really I browse this thread fairly frequently and haven’t seen people post about having a beta classic account show up randomly. After the old stress test stuff got deleted and replaced
---
 I still remember hte day the gates opened and the EN servers faced the German servers in PvP, was some of the most insanely competitive and fun stuff of all time... until the nuked it and just smooshed us all together. Bah.
---
True, but there's also the addon limitations. Is what you described even possible (I never tried making any addons)? It feels like that would be too much "heavy-lifting" by Blizzard's standards? I imagine the chinese-blocking addon does it by unicode range or something, rather than straight up dictionary comparisons.
---
It's not a problem at all.
---
The game has NEVER been about PVP, and that's the only thing you could make an argument for it changing significantly.
---
And Activision hadn't been lazy cowards, they would have added mounted combat to the game, which would have negated even that. That's the true problem with WOW. Instead of building and adding features like flying and supporting them, all they do is release middling to shitty content and REMOVE things like flying, talents, and so on.
---
Yes, hence the difficulty. The regular bosses were pretty tough, but apparently lots of people had trouble with the whole 3 abilities that the dragons had.
---
I still maintain that most of the people complaining about layering now, would be the same ones complaining about not being able to log in when they want for a few weeks after release.
---
Seemed like a bug to me.
---
Maybe Blizzard shouldn't force people to have to sub to their garbage game if they want help TESTING their product for free?  There use to be a day where testers were being paid rather than the other way around.
---
Blizzard has said that they want to recreate classic, blizzard even has a bit at blizzcon about leaving a street lamp a certain color because it is authentic.
---
Auto attack sounds effects are pretty basic on the list, it makes sense that someone should point it out in an attempt to see if it'll get fixed.
---
So you're too cool to care about beta testing, yet you're just enough of an autist to flame people for making a post like this.
---
Agree to disagree I guess. Questing keeps me engaged especially when the mobs are close and its easy to pull 3 things at once and die.
---
I played on pservers and while different than classic the core game will be the same, i played them for quite awhile and farming herbs and cloth in felwood for 6 hours+? sign me up, loved every single second of it, leveling and grinding is apart of the game that we all love
---
Wants no changes but vanilla never had millions of players trying to play at once. Guess you won’t be playing then.
---
[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k01xsCj_m20&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=71) is a Crippling proc off of Sap. I did not remember this either. Obviously Instant doesn't behave like this.
---
Yeah I just meant stuff like Oprahwindfury, Executie, Asmonbald, etc. 
---
I think anyone remotely creative will have at least a few names that won't be taken.
---
Truly, if you hate it so much ...
---
If Horde and Alliance could be in separate layers then I'd agree with you. But since I have to see them, I want seeing them to mean something, rather than them being an awkward waste of pixels, less important than a leaf on the ground.
---
there are already websites and discords going up in which germans are planning their launch to have a unofficial german servers in which 90% of the community will be german.
---
If they do release it as is they will need about 200-400 servers for 1-2 mil players on day/week one (3K per server with 2K in queue). Just imagine seeing 300 or so servers to choose from? It is very likely about 50% or more of the original wave will stop playing before level 60. What if your server of the 300 is affected a lot.... now you are on a dead server and cant even transfer off.
---
Breathe in grasshopper.
---
Never noticed before that Kenny is using an old ghetto-ass PC and CRT monitor.
---
So..if you knew anything, they lost all of there data from Vanilla and essentially are recreating Classic from the ground up with the help of Nostro people that they hired, so before you rant, actually educate yourself some...
---
There's a small sound added for arrow hits? LITERALLY UNPLAYABLE, THIS IS NOT CLASSIC REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Thank you. Had a nose exhale laugh at this.
---
Thanks for the post. I'm glad to hear there's not a ton I'd actually be missing out on by rolling PvE. I do admit that missing out on large scale WPVP would suck but weighed against everything else it's not worth it.
---
They've done a good job filling out most of the design space.  What class would you add?  They need a new mail class pretty badly, but can you think of anything that would fit?
---
Lol, nah nothing like that. I have some names that have higher chances but some I know 99% I won’t get, like one word, one syllable type
---
Lol all of the greater Denver area is about $1100 for a studio if you want to not get stabbed.
---
I noticed a bug regarding the pet action bar. After I teach a pet a new ability it doesnt appear on the bar until I click one of the buttons that are already on the bar. The update for that part of the UI seems a bit bugged.
---
It IS mechanically harder, but not more time-consuming if you account for organization necessary in classic.
---
Then PVP realms aren't for you. You can't be sold on them if competition means nothing to you. Just don't be surprised when your accomplishments aren't celebrated as much as those on PVP realms.
---
&gt; But as far as leveling, its literally just ganks. 
---
This is inherently false though. The beta has been full of fair PVP fights at every level that puts players in contested zones.
---
a
---
Dealsheals is an amazing name
---
I can understand that point of view. I just don't share the same sentiment.
---
Asmongold got 1 day ban on twitch because of a dark humour joke. Did you actually get offended by that?
---
Lol I got killed by pillagers 10+ times...
---
Talk about being completely unauthentic.  
---
I'd rather deal with the long term abuse than needing to go to a rested area to switch layers to a group.  Imagine being in a desolace as alliance, you see someone in chat wanting to group, and then one of you now needs to go spend 10+ minutes making a round trip journey just to properly 'phase'.
---
No way man, this isn't a solution to anything.  Making grouping more tedious is the complete opposite of what they should be doing.
---
Unless these gets fixed 
---
I'm not even gonna bother with playing Classic
---
Level capping the characters that can be layered is a much much better solution than "just layering the starting zones" because layering individual zones is not "layering", that would be something closer to sharding. Plus, it would affect all the trial account. 
---
It's a much better solution. But personally, I think it's going to be a non-issue. The layering infrastructure is still being tested so I think come launch we're going to see it in action when it's actually finished and barely notice it. I think the bugs will have been worked out by then, and it'll be gone before we realize it. But if they absolutely had to make a change, this is a much more sensible suggestion than "layer the starting zones only" because something like this wouldn't require transitions by zone, just a single sign out or load screen when you hit 20
---
&gt; health regen is off
---
No it's not. Health regen at 1-15ish is much higher than 20+. We're so used to playing level 60s on pservers that it feels higher.
---
&gt; The game has NEVER been about PVP, and that's the only thing you could make an argument for it changing significantly.
---
HAHAHAHA WHAT
---
It makes the world 10x smaller. You can literally skip every obstacle. It makes the world a fucking theme park where you can just jump in and out of challenge as you please.
---
I love seeing you nerds be so mad about streamers, haha.
---
Because giving a chance - as a replacement, rather than an addition - to something that is not wanted by the thousands of people that do not agree with this makes no sense. And because giving it a chance (if it is a replacement), means there is no going back from it.
---
Because multi-language servers will split the server population up into their respective communities (we know this to be true from past examples). It means that there will be multiple segregated communities on one server that will write in their own languages, be less likely to group up and interact with each other. There will be no server community, like we all know and loved from the past - the reason why we wanted Vanilla back in the first place. And it fosters hostility towards certain groups, who are refusing to at least speak English.
---
Moreover, it will alienate all people, who do not speak English as a second language well enough to communicate with other people - who are also willing to at least speak English.
---
Groups (both pve and pvp) will tend to communicate in the language that most people that know each other speak more often than not and thus, willingly or unwillingly, exclude anyone else who does not understand them. We also know this to be true from past experience.
---
RP Servers are kind of screwed even more so, because immersion is related to the ability to act out your RP, which is difficult for many more people in terms of quality of communication, even with average English skills and even if the servers were English only. On a multi-language servers, there is no immersion if you can only understand 1/6th of everything that people are talking about.
---
I say Blizzard can give it a chance, maybe by introducing a multi-language server for everyone who wants to play on a server, where all languages are spoken - but in addition to regular language specific servers for the EU, not as a replacement.
---
After 48 hours, there are already 35 German guilds who joined together and when I look at the discord, about 1500 people. And from what I know, we are also aligning with French and other Regions this weekend for each one to be able to get "their" own server. To be honest, I am quite amazed at the amount of communication and collaboration within the EU, across borders and languages, to have people get what they want.
---
Im from Slovakia, you really dont need to tell me about eastern eu and the impact, communism had on our countries haha. Yes, our parents learnt russian and german language and 40 years old people and older are having hard time. I dont, however, know anyone around me, who wouldnt know english on a good level at the age of 20-30. You kinda shocked me with this education in Germany. Since your country is considered to be a technological leader in the world, I would expect it to be filled with educated people. (Seems like, long term migration policy is taking its price I dare to guess)
---
They probably meant in the long term. Everyone knows the servers will be packed for the first couple weeks but I think the population will settle at about 20-30% of the initial surge after a 6 months or so.
---
Man, you know nothing. They had a 1.12 reference client to work from, the actual issue was getting it to work in the modern infrastructure. Also, there was never any hard evidence of them hiring on any Nost. team members. Imagine trying to spew false information as if you couldn’t have googled beforehand.
---
While yeah, people who give streamers (or anyone famous really) an excessive amount of money / gifts just to feel some kind of acceptance are what I'd consider cringy. I don't think it's fair to say that streamers are ruining the game. Its the people who follow them ingame that are the bigger problem. One individual player can't really make that big of an impact in an MMO but the hoard of followers who follow a streamer can. That being said, most of the issues that this hoard of followers causes is generally not intended by the streamer. It's impossible for a streamer to control how many people follow them through an area or attempt to stop their viewers from camping spawns in an area or just let them play in peace.
---
Many streamers even the ones you may hate do good things for the game. Content creation, even if it's reaction videos is something that brings in more discussion, more advertising/popularity for the game and keeps the game relevant. While I wish that more "content creators" were creating content that was of higher quality e.g well edited discussion videos, pvp/pve videos, machinima etc instead of just streams and podcasts. That issue isn't just limited to WoW, it's happening everywhere because people realized they can get paid more by lazily sitting in front of a camera and talking every now and then.
---
And yeah, streaming does still requires effort and you need to be good at talking to make money. But once you've built that following and are comfortable you're in a position where you can make boatloads of money with little effort. So why would you switch to pushing out a few ~10minute videos that require research and a bunch of editing which takes just as much time as streaming for a few days, is more tiring and makes you less money?
---
Anyway back to the point of people who watch streamers making the game worse for everyone, I do agree that they're making it worse for players when a hoard of "followers" runs through a zone or makes a server lag out It's really not going to happen that much to each individual player that it's going to make a big impact. Probably the biggest issue would be if it starts to affect the realms economy. One person being handed extra gold or free raid loot is annoying in the sense that it feels unfair but it's not going to ruin the game for anyone. A whole servers economy being ruined because a streamer got all their followers to farm a certain thing definitely could but even then I doubt it would happen to such an extent that it was extremely detrimental to players.
---
They lost the original code. They're remaking Vanilla as best they can with the new engine. Don't like that fact? Then don't play.
---
I leveled on a pvp server when the game launched 15 years ago. There was barely any world pvp and this time around it'll be even less since the retail players will make up a large chunk of the playerbase and they don't do world pvp at all, blizzard have to force them to do it through overpowered quest rewards.
---
There's already tons of changes. Adding a tiny sound effect for ranged weapon hits affects nothing.
---
The original cap was a design choice, not a hardware limitation. Been stated on multiple interviews with original bliz employees.
---
No the thing is - as long as they keep their word - layering won't be an issue because it's only in certain zones. We - the community - have raised our voices. They know how tricky this thing is. If they fuck it up post launch by keeping layering active into areas where it actually matters, then we can riot. Doing this now - quite frankly - is just a dumb thing to do.
---
Seems to me like spell effects are added to an additional batch after the damage is applied
---
I hope retail takes some lessons from classic. It would be nice if both games were fun. I had fun in a lot of Legion, even with all of its flaws, so I think that retail could be a good game and still retain some of the convenience that the retail crowd loves. For me personally when I log into classic on the 26th, that toon will be my real main.
---
This is something that I wont ever understand, but congratulations I guess
---
No one from Nostradamus is working at Blizzard.
---
I suspect those will happen on PvE servers when the 60's get bored or people engage in them for the nostalgia factor.
---
Errrrything
---
Yea thats why i take the longest line in supermarket when paying my shoppings. Slow progress gives me feeling of getting rewarded. Oh man that is awesome.
---
Can I post there without a current subscription?
---
Yup, obviously the system isn't finished and fleshed out or even close to how they want it to be yet but instead of crying that the sky is falling we should point out what's wrong by issuing bug reports and what not.
---
But we - normal players - have actually no clue what they are actually testing. The layer limits currently are far from what they will be like on launch. They are testing the SYSTEM, not the numbers.
---
That's why complaining about empty layers right now is just absurd and stupid.
---
By any means I am not trying to convince. Just expressing my own experiences. If you enjoy a more predictable controlled type of experience PVE is all the way. If you like to play fantasy an pretend go RP. If you like what I described PVP is the way.
---
I thought so. 
---
Just about no one on earth disagrees with that, you're like a crazed man yelling at a wall.
---
Classic raiding is flawed when compared to current raiding of course, because raids are just about the only thing the wow team has worked on and improved from a mechanics standpoint in 10 years+
---
Art and QoL are obviously better but wow expansions are effectively "play for two months, then quit..unless you raid" while classic was about everything else. Vanilla wow actually had a game around the raid.
---
So if you only play wow to raid (which is pretty common as, like I said, that's really all that's left in retail), then you have good reason not to care about classic wow
---
hahaha i know right? i'm going to donate $50 to his stream just to piss off the nerds here lmao
---
You will have your main to help out your alt.  And the danger just adds fun tension.  Its fun to make a great escape and get out of the clutches of a ganker.  I would argue that you atleast give it a try.  Theres a huge aspect of the game you miss out on when rolling PvE.  But thats just my opinion. You do you dog
---
Played troll hunter. Now I’m going to try dorf Hunter because I never made an alliance char past 20 so it’ll be very different quest wise and will hopefully feel even more like a brand new experience.
---
like in any modern mmo who all suck dick. nice... everyone who says that this isn't an issue clearly doesn't know what classic is about. people saying you have your guild and thats good enough are obviously retail fuckers. there u dont interact with people outside of your guild for the most part. in classic you constantly run into other people and with everyone speaking different languages this experience will be very shitty. not to mention all the shitters who'll refuse to speak english (or the poor fucks who can't). i can already feel the french spam...
---
The dragon was kitable long after kazzak was
---
In vanilla I paid for someone to kite the dragon to SW on Christmas one year, Frostwolf server. It was hilarious
---
Blizzard will not take out layering last minute. Layering will be active post launch for a while. We have to trust their word that they are removing it for zones where it starts to actually matter. Doing any further complaining now is just dumb.
---
Gear didn't really matter, I guess was more of what I meant.  Oculus is difficult in a way that reminds me of how some ESO vet dungeons are difficult.  The difficulty is all from mechanics and paying attention, not from it just requiring bigger numbers.
---
Yeah that stood out to me too, kinda makes me think this is a made up story.
---
Nobody would call manual group formation "queueing up".
---
Why do you need someone to sell you something you very obviously don’t want?
---
That’s like someone who drives electric cars saying SELL ME ON A HUMMER.
---
You’re a carebear, be a carebear.
---
I repeat: that's why you SUPPORT new features. 
---
Characters can move faster? No problem. ADD MORE VERTICAL CONTENT. Make the world bigger. 
---
See? That's how it's done.
---
NOT CUTTING crap and penny pinching.
---
Nobody cares about accomplishments, PvE or PvP. Just because its an old game doesnt mean people are going to care about stuff they did back then. It'll be just like Old School Runescape, people will care about the first players to do X Y and Z but it will eventually get to a point where even maxing is just 'whatever'.  Nothing anyone does on a PvP server will be more or less impressive than someone someone does on a PvE server.
---
The beta is capped at 40 and most of the people are already level 40. There is nothing to do at the end except PvP. It's contained in it's own little way.
---
There will be a lot of broken things at launch. Beta was too late and seems to prioritise building hype over focused testing.
---
2 months out, nobody has been in a 60 dungeon, and there are laundry lists of broken things that havent been fixed since the first stress test.
---
Blizzard. Why isn't this guy in the Beta?
---
TIL there really is a fountain of youth.
---
Disagree with spooket on the internet and it reverses your aging to 17 again.
---
It's insanely time consuming. It takes a lot of time to learn the fights.
---
A youtube video put it best.  WoW retail is an action game.  WoW classic an RPG.  I'm not going to say either is better or worse, but they are very different games.
---
Is this even a bug?  
---
I remember spell batching/delay allowing a rogue to stealth through a mage spamming rank 1 blizzard on themselves to successfully get the opener in vanilla.
---
I think something  like a 30-60 second lock and not infight would have a similar effect on pvp abuse and maybe to farming exploit
---
I want different points of view.
---
you could always play pvp restro in bgs and therefore you could raid in a pvp spec
---
probably not what you want to hear though
---
I'm quite fond of languages and I speak english reasonably well. However I well never be able to write poems or express myself like a Shakespeare, Joyce, Dickens or Jack London.
---
However in german I'd be able to write lengthy RP elements for my tauren warrior in bright colours and nuance.
---
By being forced to speak english a lot of the RP charme of an RPG is getting lost.
---
I've raided on Nos, LH and ND in english and germans guilds. And the german language by a mothertongue speaking german was a lot more pleasing than some random swedish guy with his insufferable swedish lisp.
---
thats actually why I played alot with americans, because they atleast sounded nice and were pleasing to listen to.
---
1) You can take 15 seconds to see they have people from Nostro working with the development team
---
2) so , they had a reference client that did not work, thus, the began from scratch..again all things discussed in developer videos
---
I’ve always mained hunter and I couldn’t care less about this. As a matter of fact, I might actually use a gun in Classic if they replace the sfx with the new gun sounds from Live haha
---
&gt;I'm sorry if this sounds like rambling, but i legitimately want to know why someone who could not care less about open world PvP would join a PvP server. 
---
They wouldn't. You may as well ask "I want to know why someone who doesn't like MMO's would enjoy World of Warcaft". They wouldn't. I would tell that person not to play the game.
---
Racist comment=dark humor???
---
Calling a race of people animals and saying he wished they died in hurricane katrina was such good humor. 
---
I’m done here. I’m not gonna reply to someone that calls racism dark humor.
---
Is there a source? From what I remember ppl sat for hours in queue. I remember server lagging and crashing if there were too many ppl in IF.
---
They are not legally required to maximize profits, but they are pressured to do so because it's usually rich people owning a majority of the shares. If these rich capitalists get butthurt, they sell their stocks and make the company lose value. Capitalism is a system that favors those with money, and most of the money is sitting with a few thousand people. So those people get the most say in huge corporations. So when some billionaire says "look how much money Candy Crush made, make WoW like that!" The studio bends the knee.

---
Only sort of related - the gameplay in classic is going to be rage normalized right? I understand why they had to do it but I would really love having the old style of rage for a few months - makes getting that whirlwind axe at 30 a much bigger deal.
---
You still haven’t made one coherent argument, and I’m confident you can’t because you’re an idiot :) 
---
If you want a new reply, just read my posts again, rinse and repeat until you eventually get it. Or wait and see what happens when it launches, with layering. 
---
Also, glad you fell for the most obvious troll ever, dig deeper, there are a few more.
---
Bye Felicia :)
---
&gt; Nobody cares about accomplishments
---
This is your opinion and nothing more. Even on the Stress Test, people cared about random accomplishments that won't even matter in the full game.
---
&gt; The beta is capped at 40 and most of the people are already level 40.
---
I was not at all speaking about level 40.
---
Still thinking about it but thanks for the input.
---
True but we didn't had it back in the days.
---
I really don't mind.
---
Ohh I run a mixed european gaming community - im more than happy to play on a mixed language server. Though I believe people should have the CHOICE.
---
Imagine forcing big spoken languages to adapt to english
---
Again, useless in pve is not the same as useless.
---
If you only play to raid in vanilla you'll find it's the same as retail... except you do a whole lot more obnoxious grinding... grinding that will be made harder because of private servers making things more lax, like having a critical herb for really powerful potions only spawn every 3-ish hours whereas in private servers it was a 20 minute spawn timer.
---
Take it from a guy that's played vanilla on private servers for ages... the game is not that different, it is just way grindier with far slower combat both in pvp and pve.
---
OH and screw playing things you enjoy, if you play meme specs your grinding will only get 100 times worse if you want to keep up.
---
Enjoy spending several hours a day just looking around for flowers or farming gold to buy consumables
---
Just confirmed this works. Cheers for the useful macro(s)!

Never get a car loan. Or any other debt for that matter.  that's the key to happiness.

I dont want to play Duolingo: WoW edition for christ sake. 
---
I want to come home and play a game to chill out. Not being forced to become even more proficient.
---
Totally forgot about this!  Haha
---
It seems like overkill, wouldn't priest/melee dps be faster? You can still duo elites that way, but you'll get through typical content much more quickly.
---
They... did, though. The zone was shut down for most of the beta, and since it was the first zone, new characters were just made at level 86 instead of 85 (or did we have to talk to an NPC for that? I don't recall...). Like, it factually happened. I can probably dig up some videos of the original Jade Forest experience, too. I think I recall the Yogscast covering it?
---
&gt; How would this deter solo players?
---
By not having a multitude of accounts to fall back on (through guild, guild alt accounts or whichever initiative)
---
&gt; Layering gives preference to those in your guild and on your friend's list
---
Just don't join guilds on accounts that intend to serve as layering vessels
---
&gt; If not, it's really your fault for knowingly being in two different Layers and refusing to group up.
---
I don't think there is or will be a way to identify which layer you are in.
---
&gt; You could also force those without high-level gathering professions to always prefer Layering over those with them.
---
You could, but that isn't at all intuitive. I can't see them breaking from the invitee being layered to the person extending the invite under any circumstance. There's a range of hyper specific restrictions you could implement that would functionally combat layer abuse, but again, Blizzard considers more than just function and they aren't about release a "layering survival guide" for a feature that's intended to last for a fraction of the expansion.
---
Right? Now I’m fucking pumped to have a $1000 rent for 2/2 condo with a garage, but the again I live in one of the bigger cities in Florida
---
only 84 level 40's online right now lmao
---
I’m not going to talk about it.
---
It's the weekend after a very large Stress Test. Chill the fuck out.
---
It had NOTHING to do with race you sensitive dunce.
---
the fact that you call them Activision and not Blizzard tells me more than enough about you...
---
If everyone plays now there will be no excitement for the actual game
---
Then I'll just choose not to believe it. 
---
When you look up Asmongold suspension/ban etc. on google the 1 day twitch ban is the only thing that comes up.
---
Please explain to me how a guild or multiple accounts of any kind would allow you to abuse Layering in any meaningful way with these rules in place.
---
Its a new experience dude. Classic will eventually be streamlined and raid clears will just be expected from most guilds. After a period of time, it wont be impressive to anyone outside of the guild.
---
If I wasn't open to other points of view, I wouldn't have made the post. Don't get defensive because I didn't immediately agree with you.
---
Chill
---
I know people want to play but really more people probably won't help realistically. Their list of important bugs to work on is probably something like 300+ long at this point, and they've got to prioritize what they need to fix for release. More people aint gonna help. If you want to play go play on a PS.
---
I wish "ISP Upgraded" was an option around here :(
---
*true classic experience intensifies*
---
&gt; I'm watching someone do transmog runs through BWL atm. A place like BWL was this end goal for me in the early days of WoW. It had this sense of mystique.
---
I'm sorry but this has got to be one of the silliest statements.  You're basically saying no matter what level, what gear you have etc. that BWL should always be a challenge
---
I live in the EU, English is not my first language but just like in every first world country I learned how to communicate in English and I don’t expect everyone else to adapt to my native language.
---
It's not just about being able to speak english. I am german and my english is way above average for a german, yet I feel more comfortable on a german server opposed to an english one. It's a matter of feeling. Just because I can speak a language well it doesn't mean I automatically wanna live in a country where it's spoken either.
---
You did not.
---
Id rather get stabbed
---
Holy overreaction, Batman.

---
This is the first source from a quick google. Did you have a source for your claims too? Would be interested to see it.
---
Yeah but Pservers provide a way more authentic vanilla experience plus they’re free to play so what did you expect...
---
People really like to say playing on a PvP server IS the correct way to play the game. That's why i made this post. Good analogy though.
---
HaViNg oThEr PlAyErS iN aN MmOrPg Is BaD.
---
Same situation here, I feel you
---
^
---
You're not understanding a lot of the content in the game. Take World Bosses for example. On a PVE realm, if your opposite faction gets there first, there's absolutely nothing your faction can do to compete for that boss.
---
the only one I saw was [https://classicdb.ch/?item=1131](https://classicdb.ch/?item=1131) and Stiches femur, which is also 50 armor with no bonuses. I really just want to know if there is a formula or table for green random enchant items so i can see the max possible stat bonus.
---
It has nothing to do with the thread.
---
The best alternative use of the taunt cube.
---
Yeah this isn't how it worked in retail vanilla though. People (me included) wanted batching like it was back in vanilla not some bad imitation that will ruin PvP. Just see the comment in the other comment thread here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c3twx9/aoe\_leeway\_has\_been\_fixed/ert7lco/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c3twx9/aoe_leeway_has_been_fixed/ert7lco/) can you really say that players could run through the entire area of a blizzard even after the spell was already channeling and only get slowed once they got outside of it? By that time players would already be in melee range of the mage before blizzard started to slow them. Absolutely not the way it worked back then.
---
Hi! Although I understand it is no comparison, I've been playing on a private server and found it most difficult to level a Mage between 20-30 until Ice Shards and Shatter are fully talented.
---
Has anyone experienced similar? If not, what do you feel is the hardest range to level through?
---
Thanks in advance!
---
Then give some non-blizzard people who have proven themselves to be reliable testers access to the reference client and let them add to the bug hunt. More eyes means higher probability of finding and fixing errors. If this bug reporter had access to the reference client they could've reported it directly to Blizzard with minimal verification needed on their part. You'd also assuage the public's fear that Blizzard is incapable of catching all the bugs by themselves if there were some third party players doing their own verification.
---
Yeah. This is my big issue with retail.
---
I came back for Legion as I heard it was good, and I was sorely disappointed.
---
I kinda liked demonology spec for warlocks, but aside from that I really just thought the expansion was pretty but shallow.
---
It was grindy, and not in the way that classic was. Grinding in classic was always towards a goal and you could no-life it and go on for days or just take it a step at a time. Not so in Legion, it was all time gated, one quest per week or per day or a certain limited amount of stuff you could do, and I hate the artificial limits.
---
Because you have no reason to hate him so you made up a BS excuse about him being racist.
---
I don’t think there was top guilds before WoW vanilla launched... and I don’t think that’s how they chose their server.
---
In most situations you don't. You don't need it on progression unless you're in some super hardcore guild or tanking vael, and you don't even need it on farm if you're alliance and your raid doesn't have geared to the teeth fury warriors who always use max consumes. It's a nice bonus but druid threat is pretty strong without it.
---
Fury tanking is the meta now, like almost all tanks that start getting gear go wirh fury/prot so dps doesnt rip threat and fights go faster, with it my fastest vael kill was about 29seconds
---
I just want to raid endgame.  Don’t care about getting all the gear but would like to clear the content at least once
---
Magey isn’t even in the beta, he just coordinated the testing from the warrior discord.
---
I think its in the character menu.
---
If they hadn’t made these changes they’d have a much larger player base. The changes have been slowly killing the game
---
With recent news from Blizzard, it's unlikely that your region will have more than one of each realm type available.
---
“Pretty sad that an open to the world private server has more people than a limited invite beta server”
---
Do you even think before you type?
---
Got flashbacks from Bendover. Full t2 human male mage with the zg and mc trinkets pom pyroing me everytime he saw me.
---
I agree.
---
Play it enough and you'll be fluent in no time. Then it will be like a second mother tongue.
---
When I spoke about this on my stream today I had various of my community members state they wouldn't play classic if there isn't going to be german servers. 3 of them are simply not able to speak english and the others prefered a native environment. I myself will certainly play it, but I know for a fact I won't enjoy it as much.
---
My english is really good and I have no issues reading/writing or listening/speaking english. I am used to watching many of my favourite series in english. Yet I highly prefer being on a german server. I was on english servers both retail and private and can say, from experience, that, even if I honestly never had any issues with communication, I still felt more "at home" on german servers.
---
I’m sure there will be guilds open to bringing 2-3 of them. But there’s also the issue of ending up with a quarter of your raid being priests or the opposite, you have to many going shadow and you’re left searching for holy priests.
---
Play whatever race you want. Fear Ward is good, but by no means necessary. Dwarf priests were super rare in vanilla and guilds still made it to Naxx.
---
Can't drop mana tide in a pvp spec tho
---
But they are Activision. Why are you in denial?
---
The salt over streamers is real. Just enjoy your life man they won't bother you :)
---
In that same video he says originally it was by design and it turned into a technical limitation as well at 40:45 in the video he says it.
---
Im with you dude. Thankfully i can cancel my vacation at any time, so i wont be wasting it on “classic” WoW. We will see.
---
&gt; tons of dead servers
---
This is trivially easy to fix (merge them together) compared to implementing a complex layering solution.
---
Didnt he say that he used to be very racist ?
---
Classic. One of my old favorites.
---
I farmed my epic mount this way on feenix  emerald dream. Good luck, that is a boring grind.
---
Don't pay attention to him. Half his brains leaked out in nam.
---
Fury definitely, dual-wield is still a bit spurious. The good tanks with good healers can pull it off, but that is wishful thinking for most raiders unfortunately.
---
I'll up vote you because I feel the exact same way.  I have no interest in ever doing battlegrounds and I tend to avoid world PVP where i can during the leveling process, because I play wow for the PVE. 
---
My idea of end game is running dungeons and raids.
---
With that said, I'm still going to roll on a PVP server and without a doubt I'll regret it as soon as I go to STV but I feel like if I don't I'm missing part of the experience.
---
with layering, we won't be seeing anyone; that's the problem
---

---
Take a deep breath...Now tell me what harm would come with raising the debuff cap?
---
It is a bug, if you use instant for example, than it cancels your ccs. Sap or gouge
---
Pls stick with retail if you rly believe what you're saying.
---
I've been watching his stream and listening to his interviews since he started streaming. He articulated all the reasons why i feel WoW isn't the same game anymore so well, and explained the reasons in just how many ways WoW isn't the same game anymore.
---
I also learned so much about game design, and the type of thinking style that you need to do it well. Super interesting, and such a thoughtful and witty guy!
---
Beware though: Once you get to see behind the curtain of this games design, you'll never unsee what you've seen, and retail may become completely dead to you because of it.
---
No it wasn't shitty back then and won't be shitty now.
---
It's a closed beta. It's intended to be limited.
---
How were there top guilds before the game was even out? What, did they have access to crystal spheres so they knew they'd be top, then build a secret council so they'd end up on the same realms as their competitors?
---
What a load of old tripe.
---
As if we weren't surprised
---
Most likely retail players.
---
Nah, all the classes are /2. So take every class and times by 2, same as you would with shaman or paladin. They still come out bottom 3
---
Most french wouldn't speak english even if they knew it.
---
Still reposting the same shitty wojak edits.
---
Their devteam can only handle so many bug reports. No point in inviting more people if you get enough bug reports to keep them buisy.
---
I usually only used them when other trinkets were on cooldowns. It's paid off maybe 6 times in my experience.
---
You're right, I dont understand. I made this thread to understand and it seems like the verdict is "If you dont like PvP then you're not missing anything by playing on the server" which is fine by me.
---
As far as world bosses, that creates tension between factions in itself does it not? Also cant you create a character of both factions on a PvE realm? Wouldn't having spies also add another layer of faction tension?
---
They are afraid that not enough players will play (long term anyways) to get a satisfyingly large community going on servers seperated by language. For some regions this might even hold true. I have 0 data on this. I don't know how big interest per region is and how well interest will translate to long term interest for people who don't know what they're getting into.
---
Making an italian server and then having 400 italians on there of which 150 leave before hitting 60 would lead to lots of complaints about a dead server.
---
Language division is also community division and them not wanting to do that shows that they're not sure if the community would survive such a fractioning.
---
Please note that I am merely explaining what I assume to be their rationale. I wouldn't dare make any predictions for classics long term success. (though I'm damn sure that launch will be ... explosive)
---
Absolutely. LFR reminds me of the scene in Space Jam where a kid runs up some stairs to dunk against a chained up Michael Jordan.
---
Remember when this sub defended layering.
---
I remember. Those of us who said this would happen got called haters. We were told we're cry babies.
---
But in reality, we just knew layering hurts the game. Does it RUIN it? No. But it hurts it quite a lot
---
Honestly, there are so many more hunter bugs, this should be the least on their priority list. Here, check this out, it's scary as hell: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rQRdHw8LgmiPEVc8ST-cwdD1kKkBwhwlK1f0eO45voU/edit#gid=0

No he never said that.

You are the one who is in denial. They are Blizzard. They have always been Blizzard. Don't praise Blizzard and hate Activision. It's Blizzard.
---
I understand that it's convenient to blame Activision so that you can keep that image of "good old Blizzard" but Blizzard is Blizzard.
---
Ah the old pre nerf stealth. Too bad for those buggers that the f-cked up days are never coming back.

That's exactly what we're talking about isn't it? The original cap.

My exact thoughts earlier. The "missing part of the experience". After reading the posts here I don't think there's an experience I'd be missing.
---
Yea twitch banned him for telling a joke. Not because he said something racist.
---
That's not what they told us in the blizzcon systems demo. They told us they'd found 1.12 code backups and classic is built on that.
---
I'm not sure where you're getting your information from...
---
Or you could take another Priest.
---
I always felt humiliated innervating Priests while I was a spirit based healer myself, but then again, I never healed for nearly as much as they did so it was totally justified.
---
No you don’t.
---
Most of the bigger P.Servers were like this, europeans chinese etc, and it was all fine. Especially if you count that instead of original ~2000 pop vanilla servers, these were 8000+ ppl.
---
On a level i get that, but that thing is blown out of proportion.
---
Till Blizzard didnt announced that, i dont think i ever read about it. But there were constant cries for RP servers, and other minor things. But never for language specific servers.
---
Yes streamer man bad. Very very bad man. Please make the bad man stop.
---
This would be interesting. Would there then be one “high level” layer (with some players below 15 or 20 in the mix) or would it be completely separate and higher level players would never see lower level players because they would never be on the same layer? Seems like a huge implication to me.
---
Damn, I guess i'm just a really insecure person that cares about Reddit karma.
---
This looks fun! Look at all the other players you could group up with and become friends. That’s what an MMORPG should feel like boys!

---
A world boss spawns, two guilds from opposite faction text all their buddies, they log on, and get to the zone ASAP.
---
On a PVP realm, a battle ensues, giving the reward to the best team.
---
On a PVE realm, whoever tags the boss first wins.
---
Every system favors those with more power, money is power. Capitalism is the only one that results in food for the poor and overall a life worth living.
---
How can you be so sure that all language groups will have enough players to fill a server? Im sure there are also a lot of French that prefer english.
---
1. You don't have to learn German. Don't be an idiot.
---
2. Layering is, to my understanding, just to help with the initial surge. It won't be necessary once the hype train moves on.
---
3. The world is changed you can't intelligently argue that the old formula would succeed overwhelmingly in the modern market.
---
Fk me but that is a steal. I go to thrift shops all the time. Almost completed my Arcoroc Lancer crystal collection.
---
Listening to the community is the original slippery slope.
---
Dude said a bunch of debuffs would be useless in pve if mobs dont have certain stats. You came in like a smart ass asking rudeley how that is the case since they can be cast in pvp as well...
---
I said "They were only talking about pve asshole"  
---
And you are still bringing up pvp? You are retarded.
---
You aren't automatically terrible if you run out of mana in an encounter.
---
And he is commenting about it, it's meant to hear his opinion when you come here.
---
thats where you're wrong buddy
---
There is a comprehensive list on the hunter classic discord. Some 40 or so bugs which are known and reported
---
bingo.
---
That's bs. It would've been way more cost efficient to use the classic client. Because then they wouldn't have to do any development at all. The downside would be a game that is easy to hack and potentially doesn't run on all systems.
---
There were like 20 french/german servers the first month of launch come on...
---
There will be even more players on classic launch than the vanilla launch
---
From a lore perspective how can the horde actually have mages? I thought mages were a purely human and elven thing, and the other races had their own kind of magic users? Always wondered that. I'd love to hear the explanation!
---
Eredar Horde here. Great times.
---
&gt; Dude said a bunch of debuffs would be useless in pve if mobs dont have certain stats
---
No, he said the debuffs would be useless, that's not the same thing and if you can't see that, then I'm sorry to tell you, but I'm the the one between the two of us who's retarded.
---
&gt; asking rudeley how that is the case since they can be cast in pvp as well..
---
Again, between the two of us, you're the only one who has been rude.
---
Thank you for the replies
---
You have no idea the amount of work I had to put in to get Onyxia's head. MOAR DOTS
---
They let it bother them so much lol. They only give them more attention by obsessing over hating them 24/7.
---
Thanks man. Just seeing what people are looking for now that's all
---
During the test I succesful organised a line for Sarkoth and it was one of the best WoW moments I've had in years.
---
Assuming your proposed restrictions are in place you would first walk out of the starting zone without proceeding into a city and then invite whichever person wants to change layers.
---
I just love the Zoomer memes.
---
I never said anything about being too busy. Nevermind. Thanks for your feedback
---
Couldnt you just get your raid to flag for pvp so any aoe damage flags the other faction, forcing them to fight?
---
That doesn't make sense since there are more german retail wow players than russian. And the russians get their own servers.
---
Plenty of guilds came over from EQ and DAOC with rosters of people that had played together for years. They probably organised what server to play on by some logical way like irc or forums like people today will with discord.
---
Lets hit a reset. I am not sure if we are agreeing or not, and what is the exact point of contention. 
---
My argument Layering is a must in order for the Classic to work on launch. They should make it so past certain level all characters are force locked to the same "main" layer and cannot switch. The cutoff level could be dynamic on the current POP of the high level characters.
---
I wAs JuSt TrOlLiNG loL uR sO dUmB bYe FeLiCiA
---
Last time I checked, most of European nations did not have their dedicated RP servers (Russians are the only Slavs who have their own servers, for example). So we RP in English on Argent Dawn.
---
It´s not a big deal.
---
No, you’re just a troll.
---
They banned him for dark humor you dunce. If it was for racism it would’ve been a much longer ban.
---
Nope. That doesn't work.
---
Blizzard is going to release realm names at least 2 weeks prior to launch. This is more than enough time for hardcore raiding guilds to determine what realm they expect everyone to roll on. 
---
I would hope they'd release the realm names before that but who knows.
---
Without layering at launch you could have 30,000 people all trying to login to a server that holds 3000. 
---
Imagine the queue times...
---
Blessing of Freedom + Intercept would like a word with your health bar
---
I don't care about the company. I care about the output.
---
Just merge the servers 4head its so trivial 4head
---
I’m 100% sure that he didn’t say that in 2018.
---
this should just show a chinese or lebanese guy
---
I so prefered playing on german servers with 400-500 concurrent players opposed to international ones with 10k+. You feel so alone when everyone speaks different languages.
---
I don't think warriors will be the most popular at high levels. They'll definitely be at least #3 but the path to 60 is rough enough for some people to quit the game. I definitely think mage will be either number 1 or 2 at 60
---
I have uninstalled it after two months of BfA. I do not ever plan on reinstalling it.
---
I'm going to give you my perspective here, so take it with a grain of salt. 
---
The game for me was about faction interaction/warfare. Back in the day, on a smaller sized server, I knew the people that would kill me on sight. I knew the people that would let me live even if they had the high ground, so to say. I knew who it was I was killing on sight, maybe even track on my second account to mess with. If you don't enjoy stuff like this you're probably better off playing on PvE, but for me it would actually kill the purpose of the game.
---
Funny, when I was reading the first few paragraphs I was thinking you were actually talking about the people defending mixed servers.
---
&gt; Once again the "community" showed that they give a fuck about others and just their view is right
---
If you care about others, you should care about people not able/willing to speak english. Saying it is fine that there will be no dedicated language server (which btw were in vanilla) is actually the racist point of view, expecting everyone to conform to your view of the world.
---
Before you try to attack my arguments by attacking me, I actually would prefer playing a mixed language server myself (I had more fun on international private servers than on EU server of my language back in the day), but I understand people who wouldn't.
---
Not layering will destroy Classic wow on launch.
---
Now that’s fine point, I definitely had not thought of it that way. But on the flip side it’s really no different than them not being there and being on their own server, other than I guess you could argue their taking up a slot an English speaking player could fill.
---
Not when the community ask for nochanges.
---
I have a hard time understanding why it's worth rioting for. Would be a positive but the world doesn't end without it
---
No. Pservers do not.  They are quite often mathematically off - in some cases significantly off, with regards to numbers etc.  Sorry but off the top of my head there's a pserver with a favourite YouTuber running naxx and after every wipe on progression fights they go back to org to turn in another head of onyxia for the buff.  In actual classic you couldn't do that as the turn in had an internal cooldown.
---
Similar reports from dungeons being harder and open world sometimes being easier and various other bugs pservers never quite fixed.
---
Classic wow is literally going to be the closest thing to actual vanilla you'll be able to play.  And don't get started on layering for the love of god.
---
What in elune’s name is a void elf
---
Don’t play PvP. Based on all your responses you don’t like PvP. Kind of simple. 
---
If you truly are looking for different views as you have said in your comments, then here is mine:
---
PvP adds a new element in the game that is harder to come by on a PvE server. It makes the game more alive and allows for things to not go your way and force you to adapt. I’m not one of those people to say PvP servers or bust, okay what you will. It makes the game more fun for me, and I believe it creates a more engaging gameplay environment. 
---
There is ganking, but it’s not too bad and it sometimes adds to the thrill of being forced to recruit others to help you overcome the enemy.
---
i believe you
---
Yea I bet you know better than *actual game developers*.
---
Go start a hobby till launch and quit crying about a beta.
---
raids and dungeons will need/want to have a loot of mages, there wont be a oversuply of them
---
Sure, it can be a choice. But this is decided by Blizzard and not anyone else. And that's the point to contact and speak with about this issue.
---
I remember trying to read Goethe in German when I had the language in school. There are so many extra words. Native English speakers complain about Shakespeare introducing a ton of new words, that's nothing compared to German. 
---
About a year ago we banned Swedes from the guild. Partly because their accent is terrible but moreso because they are all arrogant SJW keyboard warriors who are simultaneously extremely selfish.
---
Warstomp is actually really good for min-maxing elemental shaman in pvp because you can cast a chain lightning during the stun duration
---
That's already Blizzard's plan since day 1. People seem to be opposed to that.
---
Yea but I think they would have a better system than”pick the very first server on the list”
---
Especially since Vanilla wows release day wasn’t much of a release day where you had millions fighting over logging in and had to hurry up and pick a server. 
---
But the top guilds in Vanilla weren’t in top alphabetical order anyways.
---
except classic is WAY easier than what the private servers would have you believe.
---
this is the WoW equivalent of the Rick n Morty fan, thinking he has 200IQ because he understands the humor.
---
Can someone just create a site during name pre register, with all the realms and mark where will each major eu languages play?
---
Yeah because they haven't invited many EU people, probably because none of them are big streamers.
---
Except that would not guarantee the person that wants to change layers ever will. It would be completely random and if they lose that roll, they don't get to try again.
---
But you can also remove this random chance, by forcing any character under a certain level to always be the one to get layered. And/or by forcing the player that *recently* left a starting zone or city for an adjacent area to always be the one to get layered.
---
Or using the Meeting Stone to move to the group leader's layer.
---
Because factions are strictly race based in Classic. Repeat what you wrote and insert "race" instead of "faction".
---
It's not my thing.
---
Why no layering? Because it completely destroys your entire point?
---
then you should call them Blizzard because Blizzard are the devs. You are blaming the publisher side of a company for lack of quality content. That's not how this works.
---
You feigned ignorance on what buffs the guy was talking about, until he answered, then you said snarkily "hurr, I'm perdy sure those can be cast on players too.."  
---
I tell you they werent talking about on players. They were talking about casting those debuffs on mobs. FUCK OFF
---
I can’t imagine playing a hunter at this point.
---
Vanilla servers were capped at 3k, so you are factually wrong. Laying is attempting to keep a 15k population server down to 3k per layer, so it is *technically* the authentic experience in terms of population balance.
---
Getting bis 60 gear is twinking.
---
You can AoE grind from 22-30 to push through the phase without Shatter.
---
Watched it for the first time. Kinda cool
---
I know, he already wrote that...
---
With all do respect, have a nice cup of fu to all the tarts supporting layering, phasing and all that crap.
---
Ich habe keine Ahnung was du da schreibst, aber ich stimme dir voll zu.
---
Thanks! I just set it up and it works like a charm, It's the small things that matter!
---
Tell me. Was the humor about a race of people that he thinks should have died in hurricane Katrina and also calling them animals? Where’s the humor in that because to me that’s not humor at all. 
---
Twitch didn’t find it humor either. It was racist. You don’t get banned for making a joke. You get banned for being racist. 
---
But sure. Keep tossing out insults as if that helps you prove your point. It helps.
---
## you're a llama sack.
---
## you're a nerf boy.
---
It's a good thing they're actively testing, experimenting, and changing the rulesets for Layering then.
---
The unkillable priest bug on the Beta will absolutely destroy world PVP, but no one's bitching about that.
---
Record an hour of footage, cut the 95% of it where your dice land poorly, publish the rest.
---
That's vanilla enh PvP videos for you.
---
So you like being ganked huh? If you wanna spend your time deathwalking be my guest but I'll just phase and keep on playing.
---
## you're a retard zombie.
---
The only people worse than fanboys who figuratively deep throat streamers are the attention seekers constantly REEEing about them.
---
[that's cute](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rQRdHw8LgmiPEVc8ST-cwdD1kKkBwhwlK1f0eO45voU/edit)
---
two options: Layering or 200-400 servers on launch day. pick one.
---
That's because unkillable priests don't save Activision money on EC2 costs.
---
But it makes stealth.charactes harder to detect
---
Germans plan to overtake some realms in case Blizzard doesn't provide any official. It would be good if FR starts discussion about this as well.
---
Neither does Layering. It has the same costs as extra realms, if not more because of all the development, testing, and overhead logic for swapping Layers.
---
This is something I’ve tried to look at - but can not recreate. I’ve tried so on 3 different computers, my home PC, laptop, and work desktop. None of which experience this issue. Multiple other moderators have tried to recreate it, though all with no luck.  
---
I 100% believe it’s happening, we’ve gotten a dozen reports over the last month of it. Though I cannot fix something that I can’t recreate. 
---
My only recommendation is try a clean install of Firefox, with all extensions/addins disabled and report back to me. Otherwise, disabling the CSS is your only other option. 
---
Lastly, we do plan to update our CSS in the coming months, though sticking with the current theme. Hopefully something “fixes” when we do so.
---
Man I miss MoP tanking. I remember soloing the last 10% of Galkras on my bear.
---
Coming in below expectations becomes exceeding expectations in the southern hemisphere.
---
What server is this?
---
Pardon, I guess I'm speaking from the viewpoint of a private server player who has seen many crowded launches. When you see as many crowded launches as I have, you get used to it, you expect it, and it no longer irks you.
---
Ill take hundreds of dead servers in a month Alex!
---
They already have that for retail. I don't see how classic realms make a difference in this case.
---
See [this comment](https://reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c3e4i8/_/ertchzu/?context=1)
---
It's the Rage Mechanism.
---
Auto attack + heroic strike may be slow but you can fight two to 3 mobs at a time and pool excessive amounts of rage so every attack is a heroic strike. No mana, less downtime.
---
When I play Mage I oom after two or three mobs, with Warrior you can keep going until your health is low and at lvls1-5 Regen is pretty high.
---
Honestly all raid roles are boring, I wouldn't be too afraid of healing. It's being stuck between raids in healing spec that isn't fun.
---
But don't druids have a hybrid talent that allows them to be good in feral anyway? Heart of the wild or something?
---
EU servers &lt;3 even the brits write like shit.
---
I seriously doubt that Blizzard will be able to fix all these bugs in the span of 2 months.
---
Lol sap doesn't work in combat in Classic. Polymorph more than likely gets resisted. Doesn't seem likely to happen often.
---
Je suis totalement d'accord avec toi, je vais essayer de monter une guilde plutôt casu côté serveurs PVE, je sais pas ce que ça va donner avec ce choix de blibli mais bon, je vais tenter le coup quand même
---
Yeah I agree. I played from 2005 to 2007 and came back in 2010 to cata. One of my favorite things was when they'd release fresh servers so everyone had a chance to roll a fresh toon and meet new people/fight for resources and just play the damn game fresh. 
---
Personally I'm worried that everyone is just going to be obsessively min/maxing so hard and racing to endgame content that people aren't going to socialize the way they did in the old days.
---
The slow should apply as soon as the first tick of damage does, which is what's currently happening and shown in the footage but he only got hit by the first tick after running through the entire radius of the blizzard, which is just wrong. I realize that you could be incredibly lucky and pass through some of the blizzard are right after the a tick just finished, but even then blizzard ticks quite fast it shouldn't be possible to run through more than like half of the area before you got hit by the slow. This is really clear if you go and watch some of the old vanilla videos, the aoe farming videos e.g https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMeBA0D1LJY
---
Good riddance
---
WoW was not the first MMO you know.
---
option 3, there are more options that layering as is or no layering.
---
Class balance would be different, people could use abilities they shouldn't be able to use.
---
Who's talking about expecting people to adapt to other people language ?
---
Not everyone in EU speak english as a second language , far from it . And we just ask to have dedicated server depending on the language ( for the most used languages ) . 
---
English , french , german, italian and spanish are the most used languages in EU ( 64% of native speaker )
---
( English is not the most native language in europe, german is ( 16% ) . We have french at 14%  and Italian and english at 13% . So basically , we just speak english because a lot of people learn it as a second language.)
---
So the logic is , if there is a big amount of player in any given languages , we should have server for them. There's actually in BFA , a lot of English , german , and french server ( 35  French for example ) , and a lot of player . So instead of , let's say , 50 EU server , we have  5 server ( 2 pvp , 2 pve , 1rp ) for FR , ES and DE , and 35 English . And why not 1 italian ( there's 2 actually in BFA  ) .
---
And why not ? it's technically possible ( blizzard did it 15 years ago ) , they actually do it on live server , and people ask for it . And it make sense . 
---
When a game is out , there's generaly 5 languages ( ENG , DE , FR , IT , ES ) , and more if the game is suppose to hit the asian market  . 
---
Again , it's not asking for the game to be adapt in french or german . It already exist in those languages . Just for server in those languages . 
---
Like in 2004 ...
---
Ive waited years, whats a few hours on a queue
---
It's like a tradition for hunters to be broken at every launch.
---
Rage much?
---
&gt;	Layering is seperating the server into several parallel worldspaces, the entire open world at once. That’s what makes it layering as opposed to sharding. I don't know why it's so hard for you to accept
---
Because you’re sperging over semantics. You’re argument is literally that any change to Blizzard Layering™ no longer makes it Blizzard Layering™ because Blizzard Layering ™ is a term created to define **this**, not **that**.
---
It’s all you have left to fall back on since you have zero evidence to support the (wrong) argument that Blizzard Layering ™ specific zones (sorry, **I mean load balancing specific zones**) would create loading screens when you fly over them. This isn’t true, as I stated before. But apparently I have no rebuttal to the claim you posed without evidence. 
---
There aren’t even loading screens when phasing between Blizzzard Layers™ now **when it’s the whole continent being layered**. Sorry,  I mean the whole continent being load balanced in a way that is not exactly the current iteration of Blizzard Layering™ . 
---
Also hurr durr wounded pride, leave it at that, unqualified to challenge my opinion, muh background knowledge durr
---
To respond to this, there were 3 or so posts where bigoted comments and casual racism were continued to being thrown around, and I couldn’t keep up monitoring the threads. 
---
My options were to either remove the thread in entirety, or lock them. I decided to go with the later, so the conversations can still be seen and read.
---
There were multiple other places where conversations could still be had, that hadn’t degraded into a toxicity.
---
It was a fucking joke, stop being so sensitive.
---
Dont worry you guys wont have to worry about gankers you just find another layer :)
---
I don't see anything at all
---
Lol no.
---
Calm down. Relax. Go outside for a bike ride or something and get some fresh air.
---
Nyhm is a secret. Shh
---
They don't. This post is made-up bullshit.
---
I am not sure who Alex is.
---
I just hope they release realm names BEFORE they let people reserve names.
---
This might be a bit misleading, since the new server is releasing with all content available and will be shut down when classic launches (if it’s the one I’ve heard of)
---
That means that the people who plays on it likely tries to rush as fast as possible to Naxx as possible, and it doesn’t represent how players on a normal realm that stays up would react
---
That would be my guess at least
---
Didn't find the instance I faintly remeber but the essence is said [here](https://youtu.be/UHMd0KC3eTY?t=534).
---
If you check out the subs graph you see growth stop immediately with  WotLK: for the first time, people were leaving as quickly as new people were coming in. Cata is where we saw more people leaving than coming in.
---
What would be Option 3?
---
He needs to look up what the word closed means then.
---
What does calling people spergs have to do with twitch? And I want to eat a bullet because people feel the need to create a new thread bitching about layering every 10 minutes
---
&gt;I just played LB'S newly launched realm it was around 7k ppl on launch sure it was croweded but doable, and guess what no layering. Suprised?
---
No.
---
7,000 isn't an issue.
---
700,000 is an issue.
---
&gt; I just played LB'S newly launched realm it was around 7k ppl on launch sure it was croweded but doable, and guess what no layering
---
So you want Blizzard to do that too? You want them to change the game?
---
on the deadzone topic. there is a difference between combat reach (5y) of 'melee' abilities and auto attacks.
---
The first factors the center of your character as starting point the later factor your own hitbox bubble in (1,5 medium +1 per tauren -0,75 per draenei female who gets involved) hence why tauren vs tauren can auto attack each other from 8.5 y (but they can only wing clip each other from 7y range)
---
Auto shot plays be the same rules as auto attacks. Your hitbox (medium1.5)  +8y minimum range = 9.5y to the outer bubble of your targets hitbox. This means that the center of a medium sized target is 11y away.
---
As such the effective difference between minimum firing range and maximum auto attack range to reach is still 3y. (6,5 range to targets bubble vs 9,5 range to targets bubble) Just combat reach abilities (melee) have a bigger distance to cover
---
Yes it does, layers can more efficiently migrate players than traditional static servers with lengthy migrations, which means you can shut a lot of them off in the middle of the night when way fewer people are online and spin them all back up again in the middle of the day.
---
Pizza cutter post
---
You won't ever understand a bargain price on a collectable?
---
Lol imagine rerolling your main based on bugs in a BETA
---
We have flairs, though they do not work on New Reddit or with the CSS disabled.
---
I wasn't sure how Blizzard worked. Most spells have different tick speeds.
---
That’s disheartening.
---
Private servers? Post classic? You mean outside of doing some random test for a build or setup? LOL
---
Not only taking up slots but making everything more difficult. 
---
Like on LH: horde had 10% more people making the server 40:60 in horde favor, but also had lots more chinese. the alliance had more PvP hardcore players.
---
Horde was not able to outmuscle the alliance by sheer numbers, because the top horde guilds couldnt coordinate with the chinese to stomp the alliance.
---
Same with ranking in which you try to get all people on the same page in order to make ranking bearable. No english speaking chinese in the chinese premades? too bad, you now have to compete for ridiculous honor brackets, because they refused or couldnt speak with the english speaking folks.
---
Bay Area, CA
---
Sounds like a fix more than harm... actually allowing the use of ones whole abilities.
---
I couldn't care less if class balance changed.
---
I don't  understand this "no changes" bulls\*it. As long as classic's core concepts are there (which they are) why does things like balance have to stay static? why does it need to MIRROR a 13 year old version when improvements can be made? or rather tweaks.
---
People here are whining about "how easy MC and Ony will be!" ... then let them make it harder! "buh buh NO CHANGES!!!!!"
---
Nailed it.
---
Haha well I’ll have one buddy lanning with me, everybody else is kinda far and not as enthusiastic.
---
700.000/100 = 7,000
---
Just have 100 realms and if some realms die merge?
---
issue? No
---
While video game writers are generally abysmal shit she is a very unfortunate example to use. She did some of the best stuff in the last 20 years.
---
tldr
---
Millions is an issue.
---
Good find. I recommend adding it to the community's bug list
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HmeFqag7dzkvibcbvcenWtY3XJLihmvmPNtlnqqsEEo
---
You do realize shards dont stack right? And a lock should have at least 30 on raid night?
---
Yeah idk, I can't see them implement something that is counter-intuitive let alone random. The level one is appealing in function, but not sure if it's up to Blizzards standards.
---
Good ideas though, maybe Blizzard does end up compromising a little form in favor of function
---
not everyone knows every meme. Just like not everyone knows every pop culture reference and so on.
---
This is exactly what i mean with sad community :)
---
Oh look another thread bitching about layering!
---
Only this one is blaming the community!
---
No it wasn't there wasn't 30 million + blizzard fans when wow was launched there is literally zero comparison
---
Yeah LB didnt have layering but it had insane dynamic respawns to the point where some quests were no longer doable
---
I give my last silver to you, friend. For we both know.
---
Which isn't the original code, now is it? What we're getting is not the game that released in 2004, we're getting the code from the 2007 version of the game right before BC dropped. We're getting the version that was prepping for the first expac.
---
You do realize blizzard has never ever merged realms before, right?
---
Just make him be a restoration warrior. they heal by shouting at their teammates to get back up.
---
Wasn't it the DATA? it's being built on the current retail engine using the DATA from the 1.12 backup...
---
He stopped streaming like 2 years ago, hasn't released a YouTube video in over a year, and only ever talks about Sea of Thieves.
---
Fistweaving was the shit - my guild got realm first heroic Lei Shi kill 8 seconds past the enrage timer, which absolutely would have been yet another wipe if not for my DPS on top of being raid healer. I did about 2/3rds the dps of our worst damage dealer, nothing to scoff at considering the raid heals were also very solid.
---
Nice find, good that you mentioned, should probably submit a bug report in game too
---
There will be plenty of active private servers when Classic releases and people realize what kind of hot garbage it really is. LOL
---
Do it! between GMT, AEDT and PDT-EST we will have 24/7 world PVP.
---
Google slippery slope. It’s a logical fallacy aka an invalid argument.
---
He didn't know it was going to work. The person inviting him did. They exploited the system for that purpose. 
---
I'm glad they're doing it. Reveal all the potential for abuse now prior to launch.
---
Nope, half the posts are well spoken, the other half is stolen memes for karma. You're full of shit mate.
---
Dungeon queues in classic 🤔
---
What race is that?
---
When you find a good gathering spot and harvest a bunch of resources successfully you feel like you stumbled upon a hidden gem before anyone else did. The resources in the world have more value when you know that there's an uncontrolled sense of danger.
---
The game world feels more alive. 
---
You prefer a controlled sense of danger and that's okay, to each their own, but even working 12 hours shifts with a 3 year old toddler and other responsibilities I still will rather roll on a PvP server than a PvE with my limited playtime.
---
&gt;Because giving a chance - as a  replacement, rather than an addition - to something that is not wanted  by the thousands of people that do not agree with this makes no sense.  And because giving it a chance (if it is a replacement), means there is  no going back from it.  
---
&gt;Because  multi-language servers will split the server population up into their  respective communities (we know this to be true from past examples). It  means that there will be multiple segregated communities on one server  that will write in their own languages, be less likely to group up and  interact with each other. There will be no server community, like we all  know and loved from the past - the reason why we wanted Vanilla back in  the first place. And it fosters hostility towards certain groups, who  are refusing to at least speak English.  
---
&gt;Moreover,  it will alienate all people, who do not speak English as a second  language well enough to communicate with other people - who are also  willing to at least speak English.
---
I can see your point. But is there any data to supports this claim? If you have a look at SW:G back in the days, it worked very well with multi language servers. The people found their group to play with.
---
&gt;RP Servers are kind of screwed even more so, because immersion is  related to the ability to act out your RP, which is difficult for many  more people in terms of quality of communication, even with average  English skills and even if the servers were English only. On a  multi-language servers, there is no immersion if you can only understand  1/6th of everything that people are talking about. 
---
This is correct, it may break the immersion of the RP experience.
---
&gt;I say Blizzard can give it a chance, maybe by introducing a  multi-language server for everyone who wants to play on a server, where  all languages are spoken - but in addition to regular language specific  servers for the EU, not as a replacement. 
---
I think too the discussion must be with Blizzard and a solution must be found with them. But there is surly more then one solution to fix this.
---
&gt;After 48 hours, there are already 35 German guilds who joined together  and when I look at the discord, about 1500 people. And from what I know,  we are also aligning with French and other Regions this weekend for  each one to be able to get "their" own server. To be honest, I am quite  amazed at the amount of communication and collaboration within the EU,  across borders and languages, to have people get what they want. 
---
The engagement is awesome. But why not try a less aggressive way and speak with Blizzard? Community driven "rules" are dangerous and can escalate quickly. I think we both know that if a part of the community decides that a server have to speak only one language, it can quickly go to a witch hunt against other players. And there I see the problem. 
---
The community is doing something the publisher don't want. Nobody wins if players are chased off a server.
---
Thanks anyway for the civilized discussion!
---
Why should any player care if their Layer switch is random? It already is if you're playing solo and it shouldn't matter if you're grouped.
---
I nice post but it'll probably get taken down so i hope you have a copy somewhere. Should probably put it up on /r/wowservers
---
World War2craft?
---
If you really have this many issues why don’t you just not play it? Stop ranting. Go outside.
---
The problem is bigger than people think its not only french german and russian but in eu many "english" servers are unofficially different like Burning Legion is polish for example. Now if you make like 5 servers and all will be english it will become so toxic i cant even imagine...
---
Yes, and it is disheartening there are people/generations that won’t get jeopardy jokes.
---
Make it zones, nothing after the starting lvl 10 area.
---
Barrens has plenty to do. Go mess around in silverpine. And the 20+ zones it's even more spread out.
---
The simple reason is most likely close to the truth. It is cheaper not to hire additional people to support other languages for classic servers.
---
Oh the drama when a 12y old French/German tries to write a ticket. That'll be fun to decipher for the poor guy/gal who has to read it :)
---
Now to scout the different forums for 2 months to avoid the 'unoffocial ...' servers. \~.\~
---
Ditto, man! We were 15, and had recently come off of FFXIV. WoW was just amazing back in the hayday. I think it lost its way at Cataclysm.
---
We're not going to be hardcore endgame raiders. We're just looking forward to just leveling for the fun of it, rather than it just being something you do as fast as possible to get to LFR.
---
Mage/rogue
---
Figuring out that there are more options than 'layering in its current form or no layering at all' would require you reading the first post.  Not sure if you are capable of that.
---
I understand OPs intention but from my understanding layering works fundamentally differently from what OP is talking about. The core of layering is simple, once the realm server is full an identical copy of the realm server is created, but for social reasons everyone on the same group of realm servers can communicate and group up.
---
OPs idea could work if Blizz dedicated a few layers to player in certain level bracket, but then you would have a strange world where the lowbie areas are empty etc.
---
I agree. It isnt an authetic classic experience for me when the language is totally wrong. I wanna play with other german speaking players on a server
---
Tu vois , ce qui me fait chier la , c'est que j'ai presque l'impression d'etre un vieux con retrograde et limite xenophobe 
---
Mais le soucis c'est que je sais comment ca va ce passer . Ca va gueuler dans toutes les langues possibles en chat , et ca va creer des soucis alors qu'on pourrait les eviter . 
---
Je joue beaucoup a Arma 3 , et c'est exactement le meme probleme . Il n'y a pas de limitation geographique ( normal pour ce type de jeux ) , mais quand tu joues a 50 vs 50 ( voir plus ) , et que tu essaie de te coordonner , c'est une vrai galere sur des serveurs public . Beaucoup ne font aucun effort pour parler en anglais sur le canal commun , et c'est le bordel . Tu as direct des micro communautés . Ca se fait naturellement , c'est logique , mais le bordel est la malgres tout
---
Firstly there is no relation of sufficiency in retail players translating to classic players. It's equally rational to assume that the more people quit retail, the more people will play classic (don't like current game, would come back for old version)
---
Secondly they explained why russians get their own servers and it has to do with their reliance on the cyrillic alphabet. But also we're all super happy about this because playing against russians in BGs is awful due to pings and high prevalence of cheating. So even if Blizz sticks to their decision to not make language based servers, I'll be happy for not having to play with russians.
---
(sorry towards all the cool russian people out there. It's nothing personal. I hope you can understand the frustration with having to play with or against high ping players and cheaters)
---
You want me to do the math for you again? And plus babe its not going to be millions of people on launch maybe ONE million not "millions"
---
There are almost as many german retail realms as english, so I think at least for the germans this argument is negelectible.
---
Good insight, adds a bit of perspective.
---
How is this OC? This meme has been going for a while now.
---
&gt; Oceania has shitty ping (prob'ly)
---
Laughs @ 20ms
---
Yeah, the ordering is just wrong. The way it works now is:
---
1. Spell ticks
---
2. Damage is dealt to enemies with 'Blizzard' aura
---
3. Slow is applied to enemies with 'Blizzard' aura
---
4. Enemies in radius are debuffed with 'Blizzard' aura
---
5. After 1 second, go back to 1
---
I'm waiting for the cloth spell caster tank spec.
---
bruh, you've never heard of jeopardy?
---
I only see 16147 thousand criminals violating copyright laws
---
You do know that layering isn't permanent right? Should be gone by phase 2
---
In the age of discord ans with the server names being known 2 weeks in advance? Yeah there is now ay in hell people are gonna do that
---
bruh 👌🤣👏😜👌
---
Every Cata heroic I did pre nerf barely felt challenging, if literally one class in the entire dungeon finder remotely knew how to play the game we would never wipe. If there was a rogue who knew how to press sap, or a mage that knew how to press polymorph the dungeon was already won... If there was a priest that knew how to mind control the enemies healers and use their heals that healed anyone in the party to like 100% instantly without costing the priest any mana it was especially won.
---
I distinctly remember never feeling challenged at all and then Blizzard nerfing it all anyway shortly before or after looking for raid came out and that marked the end of my sub, I did buy MoP &amp; 1 month and got a monk to 40 in like a day with my 500 heirlooms and then unsubbed again indefinitely didn't even feel like seeing it's end game. Legion almost tempted me with demon hunters but the artifact bullshit and every character in the game having ashbringer was enough to bring me to my senses to not buy any expansion since MoP...
---
Classic is definitely what it will take for them to get my sub back but if they don't remove that layering shit within 1-2 months I'm done with Blactivision again.
---
If they launched with 7k per realm it would be a ghost town two weeks later when all the tourists leave. Try 30-50k per realm.
---
Mage vs Rogue  
---
Warrior vs Rogue  
---
Druid vs Rogue

Hehehe, but you understand what i mean, and thats my point.
---
Im a craftsman, and never liked school, so its fair enough xD
---
It's level 40 max beta what do you think was going to happen? I don't understand why people are confused, level 30 was getting boring a couple weeks ago before the level increased too. Adding more people isn't going to fix the fact that BGs are the only content on beta right now outside of pointlessly farming BoE's. Half of the top WoW streamers basically resorted to reacting to videos weeks ago. The problem is that the release date of classic was put so far back into the summer as to avoid colliding with retail content. Surprise to no one, a 4 month beta for a re-released  13 year old game was straight up overkill. Had classic been set to release towards the middle or end of July then this pacing of beta would have made sense.
---
Lack of EU testers are because Lizzard take US players before EU. Alot of EU  wanted BETA. And all the big streamers are US.
---
Bobby b knows all
---
DRINK AND STAY QUIET, THE KING IS TALKING!
---
Well this is exactly how they killed retail so i dont see why we cant scream for merges instead of "agreeing" to layering, becuase honestly if you have a problem with having to see or ineract with other players on launch go play retail where there is plenty of sharding and layering.
---
You have no idea what you're talking about. Every realm is in a scaled VM now. More players online = more scaling, regardless of Layering. More realms = more VMs. The cost of either is pretty much the same. And AT&amp;T doesn't shut off the servers ever, they just sell the time to some other company.

you know, shit like that

I tried to tell you all.  they killed the hype train
---
That will very likely be provided. I keep an eye on the german scene and will announce server in case Blizzard don't go back on their decision.
---
HE DOESN'T KNOW
---
Honestly they should just have reused the original classic server and classic client, and backported necessary changes to it. This would have avoided all of those issues that happen from them trying to hack live wow back into classic wow.
---
Jagex, a much smaller company, was able to do this for Old School Runescape, there's no reason Blizzard wouldn't have been able to achieve this with WoW.
---
Now I know you're not serious there is no way there will be 100 realms at launch.
---
It’s posted literally at least 5 times a day. Someone always tells them the same thing, and then they always say something about how they browse the subreddit constantly so it must not be posted that much!
---
30k vs 3k, few hours?
---
Yep. The other bugs are much higher on the prio list but I wanted to gain some attention to this in general. Hopefully this can spur on more movement on the hunter bugs.
---
1 million would still be 400 servers.
---
So fuck 300 dead servers, I guess?
---
Lmao do you actually believe all the people coming from retail (which has millions), all the people from pservers, and all the people who haven’t played either isn’t going to be in the millions?
---
Dead lord the delusion.
---
where did i state that i wanted them to change the game?
---
not to mention the loss of progress.
---
Sent in a report!
---
" i never stream anyways " .... my hero
---
big agree
---
Merging is terrible.
---
Congrats, you've now been merged with a server full of 11 year olds.
---
Jeopardy is not a thing outside US
---
Pretty disappointing, I know they're working things out and this is why we have a beta, but I'm not confident it'll be worked out before release.
---
I've heard the pet AI is supposedly worse too, not sure true that is. If so, how does a game go through 15 years of development and the AI gets worse?
---
dunno about him but sometimes he can be extremely pigheaded about certain issues and speak about them in such a matter-of-fact manner when it's clear during his rant he doesn't know what he's talking about. Then ends said rant with basically "doesn't matter im always right" which can be abrasive as the guy you asked said.
---
my bad, did not notice
---
There are only 5 quests for Deadmines (3 in the Deadmines itself and 2 in the undead area outside the dungeon)
---
Yeah, seems he's off by one month there. Name reservation happens on August 13, so subbing on that day should be enough.
---
Very useful thanks for sharing!
---
I know who that Alex is I just don't understand the context. I thought he was someone related to WOW.
---
20% of EU's playerbase doesn't get a single server in their native language and you think EU is getting more than 5 servers? Severe doubt there, especially since Blizzard said the region would be getting "several". I've never known several to mean that many.
---
The issue is that once the unofficial server has been established, it may be too late for many players as they've already leveled their char to 60 only to find out that the unofficial language of their realm is french, which they don't speak.
---
We already have a data centre in Sydney (took us 9 years).
---
I get 20ms on OCX servers and 178ms on US servers.  
---
viel spaß beim deutsch sprechen
---
Don't forget Singapore la
---
Yeah but now you are first in line for that tasty bead!
---
This post makes me feel less bad about my class and keybinding spreadsheets.
---
It'll be tolerable for leveling, and if the saturation is a bit lower at cap all the better.
---
This is assuming that it does eventually get fixed, not planning on dealing with this crap in BWL.
---
Probably going to end repeating what alot of people have already said but classic wow and retail have completely different goals. End game in classic is considered class imbalanced, not much challenge on bosses. 40mans were hard to get sorted. Dungeons are certainly not as fast paced or as hard as mythic+. 
---
But you hit the nail on the head of the advantages. Leveling has a purpose again. Making gold is a challenge and has a purpose. Its alot more of an adventure rather than power through all the content as fast as possible. LFG is also at the earliest stage and even I forgot how it actually looks on the UI. I believe you actually needed to form the group yourself and travel to the dungeon which is a great experience in itself, although much longer, and you get to know people alot more than in current group finder. And what I think is most important is gear has a purpose again. No more heirlooms powering through leveling content and every upgrade suddenly is a great find. Even at max level, you work towards your bis pieces and suddenly you feel really strong. Currently in retail, you get stuck with the same gear for weeks at a time just hoping for a piece to titanforge and then something titanforges and it turns out the piece is pretty shit for your class and probably not an upgrade.
---
You do realize layers are the same as servers, right? Being in favor of layering doesn’t mean you’re in favor of empty space lol.
---
I want my german server because I started ON A GERMAN SERVER IN CLASSIC. I want to play classic how I used to, that means on a german server with german sepaking people.
---
Yep layering is for a smooth launch but more for long term server stability in terms of population control.  It’s not perfect and causes other issues like possible over populated servers.  I personally would rather them open a lot of servers and just merge them later but that causes a lot of issues too.  At the end of the day, I’m going to have fun playing either way. 
---
And I foresee more than 50% not getting to 60.  Why make servers for people you know won’t be playing in 1-3 months?? Layering, despite the warranted negativity, helps solve this dilemma.
---
bruh? No bruh, I have heard of Alex, he is our National treasure but I never figured the connection between our WOW discussion and him.
---
More people find more issues. Your logic doesn’t really make sense. they’re not at capacity for bugs lol
---
Yeah.  I know I should feel bad, but having to deal with the worst of the worst EU Spergs (especially around World First time)  the thought of them having to sit in their own misanthropic cesspool is so satisfying. 
---
I mean... the current top post about people not being European and the replies inevitably devolving into typical insecurity toward NA says it all.
---
Alliance warrior vs mob he pulled and an undead rogue with a spit macro
---
Wow thanks for making another thread about layering saying the same things that everyone and their mother has already said!
---
Yeah I think everybody in EU is caught a bit off-guard by this decision and hopefully we can find a good solution for everybody to move forward and enjoy classic the way they want.
---
I think the obvious answer is that he misspoke. I don't think this warranted a whole thread lol
---
I am pretty sure there is a brilliant solution in one of the developers head at blizzard headquarters making 200k+ dollars a year. If not then let me know, i'll take 100$ for mine.
---
That's exactly the point of layering isn't it though? Multiple 3k "realms" to facilitate vanilla-like experience on the zones. The downside is that 1) The economy might get screwed over. (I expect it will). 2) It won't be vanilla-like since you'll have much larger population to find groups to go dungeons with (not exactly a downside in my mind but from the point of view of facilitating vanilla-like experience). There's probably others I'm dumb enough to think about.
---
As to what's wrong with having no cap during launch? Honestly, I wouldn't mind that myself. Non-layered areas might get more crowded but with how people spread out it might not be that much of a problem. But when it comes to what Blizzard seems to be wanting to do, it's that it won't be a similar experience with large enough population (compare that 3k concurrent population with 9k+ population). This of course is conjecture. I can't tell you the minds of people at Blizz. There might be all sorts of technical difficulties. Things like that. Technical difficulties and all those aside.
---
What I personally think? It will still be a shitstorm really, regardless of layering, regardless how wrong/right blizzard is about where the server populations stabilize at. Too many variables. I do still think layering seems to be probably the least shit option, even if it will probably fail. It's an effort at the very least.
---
just from those screenshots you can't see how it works in vanilla. what are they supposed to show? in neither of those screenshots is the hunter in the deadzone
---
Ah, some of the classic jokes that can never be used too many times. Just loving it
---
&gt;If you care about others, you should care about people not able/willing  to speak english. Saying it is fine that there will be no dedicated  language server (which btw were in vanilla) is actually the racist point  of view, expecting everyone to conform to your view of the world. 
---
Maybe I see the current situation not correctly, but I got this picture the last days:
---
* A community driven group decides which server is for German, French, etc.. 
---
* There are no intentions in those groups to solve this with Blizzard
---
This is against a united community. I don't care if there are language specific servers, but I care if this is decided by Blizzard (the rule maker and owner of the game) or some random groups out of the community. And this makes me sad, we know what will happen if group Z with incompatible language goes to server Y. He will be attacked and flamed. Most of the players don't read any rules made in some forum before they select a server and wanna play. Deciding who has the permission to play on a server (without the support of the game ownwer), based on a language is racism. 
---
&gt;Before you try to attack my arguments by attacking me, I actually would  prefer playing a mixed language server myself (I had more fun on  international private servers than on EU server of my language back in  the day), but I understand people who wouldn't. 
---
I was not specific enough in my initial post, you surly are not in the group I speak about. I'm sorry if you saw it otherwise.
---
I too understand this people, but they have to find a solution with Blizzard and not by their own force without respecting that these servers are still shared servers.
---
Where are you getting those thunderclap numbers from?
---
Time for Melee Leeway to be fixed now
---
If you're not ready to farm 10 MCPs a week + mats for 10 +25agi enchants you're not min-maxing enough.
---
Thats exactly why we need people like you, thanks for your service!
---
This is the only place I know where people can give me answers on classic wow so, yes. I got an answer too
---
No, I'm blaming whoever's making the game, which currently is Activision.
---
I believe there is a proper way to do this. It is similar to layering, but with static realm populations and aggressive merges when needed.
---
Ancient Sinew Wrapped Lamina full of Doomshot.
---
Completely pointless, and useless after Ash drops. I'll see how far I get.
---
Imagine rolling a class and finding out it has a ton of bugs
---
&gt; Firstly there is no relation of sufficiency in retail players translating to classic players.
---
How do you know that? There were tons of classic german realms back in 2005/2006 already.
---
As if I need this! Still got mine and my brothers copies in my closet muahahaha
---
nope
---
As far as objectives for slaying specific mobs goes that works; but then you have the gathering quests where it can take upwards of an hour to complete a quest like that solo. It usually increases the time spent when in a group.
---
How do you even know Nyhm played Vanilla? His first piece of released content wasn't until several months into TBC.
---
What's the point of this post when you've already very clearly made up your mind?
---
&gt; paladin vs paladin
---
You mean "let's see who gets a Seal of Command proc"?
---
Damn, it's even worse than I thought...
---
Server merger is bad, people dont like it. It messes with people character names, ruins server economies overnight, communities get broken. 
---
So we do agree layering in some shape of form is needed??
---
Suddenly the melee leeway doesn't look so bad (compared to this)
---
You act like they’re not going to fix bugs, just relax it’ll be okay.
---
What about human ?
---
Na dann geh kacken Junge!
---
Ich bin ein bisschen stolz, dass ich den grundlegenden Inhalt dessen verstanden habe, was Du in dem französischen Paragraphen geschrieben hast!
---
I'm semi proud that I understood the gist of what you said in the french paragraph
---
its rather easy and every class gotta farm some stuff, so idk why ppl make it seem like such a big deal
---
Would [this build](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/2302-05520201230021-03303220110051) be better then?
---
&gt; You feigned ignorance on what buffs the guy was talking about,
---
Or maybe I was just genuinely curious if there was a buff I wasn't aware of?
---
&gt; FUCK OFF

And you have the nerve to call me rude.. lmao.

It's a non-issue, layering is for launch. Beta is inconsequential. Layering gets removed with Phase 2, at which point enough people are done with early levelling that the tech is no longer needed.
---
I just need those sexy flips in my life. Humans fine though.
---
Yes, thats wrong.  There were like 20 different servers available in EU in classic.
---
It's not against the ToS, so why would it be taken down?
---
Dude what the fuck? Just live in the park for that amount of money
---
He played as a hunter.
---
We aren't talking about the demo (they mentioned it was just for the demo), we're talking about them planning to just shard just the starter zones for a couple of weeks. I say "just" because it's gotten so much worse now, but even back then people were up in arms about it as they should be,
---
Dont read it if you dont like it, its very simple.
---
The flips are great tbf.
---
I kinda want to play NE Warrior, but human is pretty good too. Nice racials.
---
It’s a fairly standard rent amount/scenario  for NYC/DC/SF
---
If only there was a way to type words into a box on a website specifically designed to find information.
---
Some of these bugs are also present in BfA and haven't been fixed in years... so, yeah.
---
A lot of you guys must not have been around during the vanilla beta.  That is one of the biggest reason Archimonde was down for a week right after the game launched.  
---
I guess all I can hope is for them to release server names before they let us reserve our character names on August 12th.
---
I see layering in topic, I press downvote. Subs floooooded with it and it's annoying. Almost makes me miss the whole "future og classic wow" posts
---
Well, that could be pretty effing shit to have to walk as an alliance player wanting to group up for the kurzen quest, but your mates are on another layer so you have to casually walk back to duskwood and die three times on your way and walk back to the cave or you have to run to booty and die about a hundred times on your back and forth run. Hmm, seems good.  
---
We must find a solution to layering and its abusability, but this isn't the exact definition of solution.
---
I never tried one (it's yet to arrive) but they are the "gold standard" of office chairs. Highly customizable and a long term investment for your back and posture.
---
Not to mention it's all mesh, which helps keeping your ass cool over long sessions.
---
I bought it used for £400 though, new prices are insane... But considering how long I spend sitting, it's the best money I might ever spend.
---
I feel like "gaming" chairs, like most gaming-branded stuff, are likely to be gimmicky.
---
how can you possibly lose a valuable friendship by deleting social media? In my eyes, any valuable friendship could  never disappear just because someone deleted social media. That means it held no value at all. I'm genuinely wondering this, not just trying to shit on social media. But I will say I am very against all social media so I'm biased.
---
&gt; We have to trust their word
---
No we absolutely do not, and I see no reason to trust them considering they have not shown themselves to be very trustworthy.
---
Screw him, play what yo like!

[Something like this might help.](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/9f/Choose-the-Perfect-Server_Realm-for-World-of-Warcraft-Using-Realm-Pop-Step-2-Version-2.jpg/aid4913582-v4-728px-Choose-the-Perfect-Server_Realm-for-World-of-Warcraft-Using-Realm-Pop-Step-2-Version-2.jpg)
---
&gt; If they don't think German language and French language servers will quite be populated enough they could have official German a d French servers.
---
Why do you assume that? There are over 30 german retail realms and about ~40 english retail realms in europe. The official bluepost in the german forum has a couple of thousand replys from people who disagree with the decision Blizzard took.
---
Server mergers affect economies as well, Character names? Plus who wants to play on Dragontooth 7, who decides when and whom to merge? I see people not liking this even more. 
---
Plus there are creative solution to server layering, some posts talk about it, for example everyone over a certain level is always on the same layer. So you still have low level ppl doing their thing while high level cant exploit and are LOCKED to a "main" layer.
---
Unless you’re planning to play in a top tier progression guild it won’t matter at all. Regular guilds back In the day didn’t discriminate based on race. Or at least, I never experienced it playing a nelf priest, which was a blast especially in pvp.
---
Hijacking to ask an honest question of the Aussies. I saw a video where a crazy Sheila explained that a shoey is when you pour your booze in a shoe and drink it.
---
Is this a real thing that happens? Or is it more of a dare/party trick/urban legend?
---
This ain't it. They put layering in because *they expect population to be through the roof.*
---
Yeah no thanks. My character getting wiped every 6 months is fucking annoying.
---
Do you really not see the huge difference between reddit (and any message/image board) and Twitter/FB/Instagram? Or are you just trying to have a gotcha moment?
---
Layering is the brilliant solution......
---
Don't forget Oceanic..
---
Back in the day aggro was a steep learning curve. Sure you start by killing wolves for pelt and stuff in the icy world surrounding ironforge then you head on over to stormwind and down to goldshire to join your human irl friends to level, go take a look round the lakes they said, kill some things known as "murlocs", WTF! I aggro three of the little bastards every time and if I don't move my ass quick enough I aggro more and more, no time to loot, my mana is gone, I'm a sitting duck, welcome to the cemetery.  I loved it because I had to adapt and learn. That's what made this game special.
---
So you are telling me to never use myself or my experiences as an exaple in a discussion? 
---
Im here open minded, think you are misunderstanding the tone...
---
Wasn’t this always the case?
---
yeah they'll be enjoying their memberberry pie more like it
---
I’d rather layering for p1 over dead servers.  So yes
---
*Literally unplayable.*
---
You can post without a sub in the classic forums.
---
Running your own server is absolutely against the ToS. You'd never get in trouble for it no, but it is reverse engineered software of copyright material. Try and post this on the wow official forums and see how you go lol.
---
In some ways yes. But it is anonymous (mostly) which makes for a big difference. 
---
But sometimes, a lot more recently in fact, I do wish I had the will to delete reddit and never return.
---
Sounds like you need to move north in Quebec where houses are around 170k-250k and minimum wage 12,50 $.
---
Thats not game breaking no where near it so far no1 has a real reason as to how itll ruin classic
---
yeah thats called having a mid life crisis but you do you booboo
---
Oh really? Because I didnt see you mention that in your previous comment.
---
I was under the impression rogues usually only run offhand poison when they're with a shaman (assuming they're aware of WFT not stacking with poison)
---
I remember TUL in wow. This guild had a rep of having people like this. Not surprised at all
---
Yes, clearly im the idiot here.
---
Hahahaha I was just about to post the same thing!!!
---
Night elf is perfectly fine. If you’re a good healer you’re a good healer; id rather have a night elf that doesn’t shield the warrior tank than a dwarf that tries to heal in shadow form.
---
I don't know, when you played like 2k hours and game is still pretty much the same it's hard to continue enjoying it. And many people played much more than that in 15 years. 
---
And how can it have larger player base when the target audience is always the same? They made game playable for larger audience so it would bring more new players, of course they lose some players with these changes, but if you don't do it, people still would leave and you won't really get any new players and after 15 years you would have just small player base. I don't see how it would be larger, more people would try the game, more people would leave the game, more people would play the game
---
Oh hey that's mine :D thanks for calling it nice.
---
This is my first real addon, and I'm learning a lot while making it. I was mostly making it for myself so that I would know when to go back to town to train, but I've had a lot of ideas that I want to implement. It's pretty cool that other people are liking it.
---
I'm not happy with the UI, because I don't know the first thing about how to make things look pretty so if anyone has any suggestions don't hesitate to throw them my way.
---
I'm planning a lot of features for it besides just showing which spells (and their costs) and weapon skills are learnt when:
---
* When clicking on a spell or weapon skill (or something similar), I would like it to make a TomTom arrow for you and mark the nearest trainer on your minimap and map (I have no idea if TomTom is or is going to be usable or if there are alternatives).
---
* I want to make it so that you can mark unwanted spells too, and maybe export/import preset "unwated spells" lists.
---
no shit, noob
---
How does batching work differently?
---
Are you using petfollow/petpassive command along with your feign death?
---
If you want to avoid people taking over servers and forcing their own language, you should support dedicated language servers, then people won't have to do that.
---
Unfortunately Blizzard (at least so far) doesn't seem to see it that way, it's up to them.
---
My goal is to keep my alts under control this time around and have a serious-business main character. I didn't do so hot in that department in Classic. Why must every class be so fun? How can I pick just one?
---
Perhaps we could narrow down what causes it? I am on a week-old install of Firefox, although I do have a few add-ons. Perhaps if the other people who have reported the issue would also share what add-ons they've got. Mine are as follows:
---
&gt;Blur: IMDB Episode Blurrer
---
&gt;HTTPS Everywhere
---
&gt;Old Reddit Redirect
---
&gt;Privacy Badger
---
&gt;Reddit Enhancement Suite
---

Though I do understand if you don't care to spend time figuring it out :)
---
We will just report anyone not using God's Language, Skånska!
---
I was a flag running God as a druid and I'm going to be again. But this time I'll have mouseovers so it will be 100% easier to play my class efficiently.
---
I've been playing heals since vanilla and I literally can't believe I didnt use mouseovers as a druid. Still managed to get to sapphiron in naxx though. This time around I'm fuckin finishing the last 2 bosses dangit
---
hell yeah
---
Someone has already proven the fact, simulating the wow world that is opensource is completely legal and not against the ToS aslong as the real wow server isn't running.
---
all assets and whatnot are available online to run in a simulator.
---
I'll tell you when I find out.
---
great post
---
That shit is just semantics, phasing is layering, layering is phasing &amp; sharding or whatever they feel like arbitrarily naming it at the time. It's shit and it doesn't belong in classic, if its not fully removed completely within 1 month (2 months max) I and many others I'm sure will be done.
---
I’m probably gonna roll a hunter regardless (fucking love their class identity) but I sincerely hope shit gets fixed before launch. I’m already gonna be a massive huntard, I don’t want to get fucked by bugs on top of my own stupidity
---
What weight does your anecdotal example with SWG hold really? I can give you my example playing FFXIV as a Brit on an "unofficial French Server" and the experience was absolute cancer .... majority of groups would French only... not many english guilds. I had to transfer.
---
It's not about hate, it's about common sense.
---
People want to speak and read their main languages.
---
I guess it's a question of more overall work vs. more likely to have gameplay bugs
---
I don't like the idea of the world not being the world.
---
You should run into the same people while leveling. 
---
You should hear about something in the world, head there, and not be confused because you're not on the same later.
---
"Broken tooth is up at x,y" you show up and nothing. Did someone get him? Or are you on the wrong layer?
---
Well clearly you haven’t been watching much because  the focus is not on trump, and if you can’t take a few trump jokes then sure...maybe you aren’t ready for some of the humor. All around didn’t understand how any of your points are valid
---
There is a very real capacity of bugs that they can work on yes. People don't seem to understand how bug testing works. If you have something broken, like hunter pets are, an extra 500 reports about the issue from random people don't help at all.   
---
You know those super nerdy posts where people break down exactly what happens like the post about instant attacks from the AV beta? Blizzard has 30 people like that on staff working 8 hours a day, with debugging modes and bug tracking software, and direct chats with the software devs. They are the ones that actually find and fix the problems. The 5,000 people in the beta are just their to give them some clues.   
---
Sure you have some intern sifting through the reports basically spending about 2 seconds on each one. 95% of them are duplicates, you might get 1 a day that is actually useful. There is a point where it's just too many, having 100,000 people in the beta would not help at all.
---
Yup the guy who responded clearly gets butt hurt about republican jokes
---
So shard the starting zones.  Whatever.  Layering isn't the solution to starting zone madness... I dont think you understand the implications on the economy
---
Layering is basically a way to handle the huge number of Classic tourists that will try the game but stop playing after a few months. If you aren't in a hurry to join a raiding guild I guess you can wait for the tourists to leave before playing.
---
A rehash of real world events? What are you even talking about? So tegrity farms is real?
---
Nonsense only layering has downsides. Everything else is surely better than layering. It will kill the game. Also the sky is falling so...
---
No but you sap ahead of pulling the pack.
---
Definitely agree, and this is what layering sounded like in their original bluepost, which is why I was so surprised when I saw the guild-fragmenting happen.
---
You sap first
---
LIVE TO WIN!
---
You're Welcome! :)
---
What are you talking about? WoW always catered to casual players. It was known as the casual, fast-paced MMO on release, even the Vanilla devs admit this was their intent. It's just that what was casual and fast-paced then isn't what's considered casual now.
---
Drakedog started one of his videos with "Hell Song - Sum 41" - it always gets me!
---
Keep in mind boss defenses are very different on private servers and dual wielding might just parry haste a bunch of bosses and be detrimental to threat rather than help.
---
But I'm sure a ton of bosses will easily be dw tankable with naxx gear still
---
Best South Park episode
---
Scared shitless that you can't compete without buffs, rofl!!!
---
I don't work for blizzard so I was assuming that each server was actually an autoscaling cluster of EC2 instances (or containers if they have containerized already) with each layer being an EC2 instance  / container.  I don't work for blizzard that many not be how they do things.
---
However, your post is definitely wrong and wouldn't work from an AWS standpoint.  Whats a 'scaled VM' and whats 'more scaling'.  If you are saying each realm is a single EC2 instance and blizzard is adding more cores / memory to that EC2 instance based on demand well that's sounds nifty except you need to **shut the instance off before doing that.** Which means they would need to reboot the realm several times a day as more players join or leave.  I guarantee you they are not doing that.

 [https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/resize-instance/](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/resize-instance/)
---
&gt;How do you know that?
---
Sufficiency in this context means that you can logically claim that if A is given, B will happen. 
---
Translated to the situation we're discussing, you are saying that if there are few retail players, there will be few classic players, as evident by the fact that you suggest that the smaller russian retail playerbase will lead to a smaller russian classic playerbase. This conclusion is logically invalid. There is no known relation between retail players and classic players - especially since we have ZERO data on how many people per region will be playing classic. So it is absolutely illogical to suggest any sort of relation between that entirely unknown variable and any other variable.
---
&gt;There were tons of classic german realms back in 2005/2006 already.
---
Same argument for this. There is no known correlation of 2005/2006 german playerbase and 2019 german classic playerbase and player retention.
---
Since we have 0 data on how many players (per region) will be playing classic, I have no idea why you think you can make predictions based on how the interest was 15 years ago or how the interest in live is.
---
The interest in live (=retail playerbase) may have a reverse relation with each other, where the less people play retail, the bigger the interest in classic is. MAY. Entirely hypothetical. Just explaining why your assertion that "fewer russian retail players" somehow translates to "fewer russian classic players" is not valid. (which you strongly implied by saying that russians getting a russian server while germans get no german server even though there are more german retail players than russian ones)
---
We have 0 data on classic interest and classic long term player retention. Blizzard MIGHT have some on interest but likely has 0 on long term retention (no way to predict that I'd wager)
---
If #nochanges had a brain whatsoever, we would know it by now.
---
The real question is if you really want to join a guild that accept lazy slackers as yourself that cant be arsed to farm 100g/week.
---
I was talking about the part of not losing points when switching targets.
---
I can’t imagine it won’t came either the day of or the day before name reservation.
---
Gotta figure it’s be day off at the latest.
---
I have no idea what I’m looking at but pretty cool
---
A new class also means another set of armor made for every future tier/pvp tier which means additional assets have to be made.
---
Doesn't look so bad?
---
Melee ranges are consistently .6 yards further than this range increase and is coupled with ACTUAL leeway to give another 2.66 yards when people are running away.
---
This mechanic is actually blizzlike compared to one that is from cata / mop era and is poisoning classic melee mechanics
---
Barrens is supposed to be a little crowded day 1. Level distribution spreads out though. It was like that on every new server bliz opened up over time in vanilla.
---
I love this! Makes me happy!
---
Undead mages are former human mages .
---
Maybe undead taught the trolls ?
---
I have neither and I'm miserable. Debt doesn't matter if you can afford to pay it.
---
Blizz is paying him to trick people?
---
&gt;I'm semi proud that I understood the gist of what you said in the french paragraph
---
I wich i could say the same without you writing translating directly german to  english . I live 10km from the german border for the past 15 years and i don't speak a word of german. It's shamefull
---
I'd hope issues like this, if not fixed during the beta will still be high priority after release to fix.
---
I played warlock back in vanilla, but plan on making a warrior this time because I’ve started liking melee and tanking a lot since
---
If all the players who like melee (DK, Monk, DH, Ret, Enhance) in retail has to play warrior or rogue, then there’s no surprise if there’s going to be a lot of them
---
And he touched my ass...
---
Finally got Revered with the wife. Come Classic I’m gunna prolly lose rep and get Hated...
---
For one - as a Tank / Healer combo they can do any dungeon at the drop of a bucket. Great for PvP aswell - a Warrior with pockets will be a blast.
---
A Warrior needs heals to do most stuff outside of leveling.

---
Anyone have stories of what the pservers with totally different communities are like? How does that even work? Just a bunch of Chinese/Russian guilds whose only interaction with the rest of the server is buying/selling on the AH? Is trade chat still all english? Very curious
---
Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if this didn't happen on the downlow.
---
Please tell me you’re roleplaying as a dead version of your former rogue
---
Exactly, so we got that out of the way.
---
From a launch point perspective these are the areas that need to be regulated.
---
This is where hundreds of people will compete with one another for quest objectives, mob spawns, quest items and so on.
---
Once players manage to get past these first 2 zones thats when the world opens up and players are spread out evenly around the map.
---
So what alot of us are suggesting is that with the current system your basically exposing the entire world to layering just to regulate these chokepoints.
---
You have no idea what you're talking about. Battle.net architecture, and how it's evolved over the years, is infinitely more complex than RuneScape servers. "Backporting necessary changes" would almost undoubtedly cause more unintentional changes than we're seeing now, and would be an incredible waste of time to achieve worse results. There's nothing wrong with bringing to light issues in the current version of classic, and I hope most of them get ironed out, but some of these backseat Dev comments are impossible not to roll your eyes at.
---
So I did some digging through 1.12 and retail sound files. Turns out there is 3 un-used arrow-hit sound files actually. Then 10 arrow-hit sound files that are used nowadays in Retail. So you're completely right, but I wonder why there was some arrow-hit sounds in vanilla they never used
---
I would lose my mind for an Undercity or O.
---
It's referencing a vanilla wow pvp video at the frame that the player exits deadzone.
---
Thinking I’m going rogue so I only need the UBRS key:
---
\^THIS GUY IS UNAWARE
---
I’ve been playing since Vanilla douche
---
is there a spot where all of these random youtube interviews are being collected? some good info in here, some of which i hadn't heard before
---
The problem isn’t change,  there were plenty of changes in TBC and WoTLK. But the game remained largely the same. The core philosophy changed with CATA, and ever since then WoW has been in decline. the problem is s change to the design philosophy.  What they’ve done in recent years is attract a much less ROG oriented crowd. They’ve gone the micro transaction route to squeeze as much money as possible out of a much less committed almost transient player base.  2,000 hrs is a drop in the bucket. I played over 7k hrs in Wrath and TBC and I wasn’t even considered a hard core player.
---
&gt;Ive waited years, whats a few hours on a queue
---
launch queues from 2004 featured 5+ hour queue's.
---
Since wow has launched there have bee. -1 ranged classes added
---
They’re not using AWS.
---
Mana spring totem exists.
---
It better not
---
I mean, it is still bad, don't get me wrong. I just don't think it looks AS bad... idk. Maybe it's just the tiny arcane explosion that makes it look kinda silly lol
---
I assume in 2019 people are tech savvy enough to not need someone to hold their hand through a game that has been out for 15 years.
---
Guess I was wrong.
---
We can have differencing opinions that’s fine, the only bad expansion was WoD
---
It had damn near 0 content post launch outside of raid tiers opening up, Tanaan jungle was supposed to be the final leveling zone was tweaked just a couple months before launch to be a max lvl zone.
---
None of the expansions are perfect all have flaws and high points 
---
I never hated cata or mop so I know I’m in the monitory 🤷🏻‍♂️ and as much as I loved tbc, wrath is probably my favorite complete expansion cause I felt it opened up raiding for more casual people while still having the cutting edge for the hardcore 
---
I know people bash dungeon finder but honestly those shit players were always there you just now could run into them and have to group with them lol
---
this is very naive. how long have you been playing wow?
---
blizz is very notorious for not fixing bugs in beta, not in the first couple weeks after launch, not in the first patch, and before you know it the next expac is out and the bug is still there.
---
Does it hurt your snowflake fee fees when they make fun of daddy trump?
---
Get the fuck over it.
---
Blizzard is bracing for full atomic fallout and people here talking about luxurious like server identity.
---
I Hope they do something about the exploits.
---
Europe (specifically members of the EU-28) has a population of [408,879,069 above 15 (age). Out of those 51% speak English. 26% speak French. 32% speak German and 15% speak Spanish.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_the_European_Union)
---
You could also look at the [knowledge of English map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_the_European_Union#/media/File:Knowledge_of_English_EU_map.svg) to see that these countries obviously have a significantly smaller number of English speakers.
---
French and German servers existed in vanilla from practically the EU start. 
---
I don't see any positives in preventing those people from playing or forcing them to isolate themselves in insular communities on English servers now. 
---
Give them the choice, and also importantly, prevent us English-speakers from accidentally ending up on unofficial foreign language dominated servers.
---
"no ur wrong"
---
Nice counterargument.
---
Yeah gnomes are small so the radius is smaller on them IIRC
---
But it feels so bad when you can actually get melee'd from arcane explosion arcane
---
for real!
---
He passed away last year unfortunately.
---
Yah, it gave us TBC which is an infinitely better game than Vanilla wow.
---
Wouldn't decreasing the batch window down to about 1/4 of what it is now solve these problems?
---
I think that would destroy the point of this all. There are private servers for that. It could be considered years later once this all settled but for now it should be something they aren't actively considering.
---
If two rogues standing across each other, sapped, isn't the first thing coming to your mind, then I don't even know what to say to you.
---
And when you finally score with the girl you’ve been chasing for years, you also want it to be over ASAP? You are comparing pears and apples.
---
By that he means danish. Eller så låter det i alla fall.
---
And with ilvl scaling the upgrade is 0.1% :)
---
Well at the very least blizzard stated no layering after phase 1, period - so if they keep their word the layering won’t exist once the honor system is a thing, where the real world pvp begins
---
Brm in mop was really good tho, literally bis tank with a disc priest for cmodes
---
Yeah some people are just oblivious. No point in feeding the trolls.
---
The classic wow dev team actually cares and communicates with the community. The whole success of classic is based on authenticity. All they care about in retail wow is transmog, mounts, and time gated content. Who cares about retail bugs when the gameplay is shit either way. Blizz knows classic is different.
---
Psh that's what Mages were for.  HAHA.  Also Deadmines was the exact dungeon I was thinking about.
---
Well duh. Why would you participate in a subreddit where the language everyone uses is one you don't understand. Of course everyone currently talking about it will be those who understand English.
---
It's like saying everyone stuck in traffic seems to have a driver's license.
---
Whats like average income?
---
I upvoted just because you call people cunts
---
Wow was defined to be un-killable..
---
Wow is the Wow killer.
---
Damn you didn't really read retail retail forums before classic got popular recently  then... People were shitting on classic 24/7 saying it is only nostalgia and that the game is garbage and no one wants it
---
No and I only subbed to play beta for Classic.  I find retail boring personally.
---
Added it at the bottom of the post.
---
I completely agree with you here. The paltry number of people they have given beta access to test is inexcusable. Im testing on the PvE server and its a goddamned wasteland in any zone above level 20 because everyone is 30+ or at the 40 cap already.
---
I have no idea why they are rationing beta access like its some sort of rare mineral or something. Makes no sense.
---
Ye true. Maybe it's because both of you are gnomes that kinda tricks me.
---
The lack of metric is honestly my biggest gripe.
---
I’m 27 and I make 80 and I feel like I don’t make nearly as much as most of my friends. One bedroom apartments are upwards of 2300
---
&gt;Tu vois , ce qui me fait chier la , c'est que j'ai presque l'impression d'etre un vieux con retrograde et limite xenophobe   
---
&gt;Mais le soucis c'est que je sais comment ca va ce passer . Ca va gueuler dans toutes les langues possibles en chat , et ca va creer des soucis alors qu'on pourrait les eviter .
---
Du côté des américains, y se plaignent par rapport aux latins et aux brésiliens, parce que les serveurs sont connectés, si tu veux queue pour faire des donjons ou des raids. Parce qu'il y en a plein qui parlent pas trop bien anglais, ça cause rien que des problèmes. Mais quand on suggère de les séparer, pour éviter les problèmes de coordinations et de langues, on se fait traiter de racistes, on se fait dire que c'est à nous d'apprendre l'espagnol ou le portugais et non à eux d'apprendre l'anglais, etc.
---
C'est con, mais c'est intéressant de voir à quel point la mentalité change entre le côté américain et le côté européens.
---
Sorry you feel that way. Take a few deep breaths and relax, friend.
---
It's not that easy lol. Wanna bet that most of these bugs are still going to be there at launch?
---
&gt;paladin vs paladin
---
&gt;priest vs priest
---
&gt;druid vs druid
---
&gt;shaman vs shaman  
---
Ah yes the riveting *whose BG queue will pop and disappear first* duels.
---
One of the things I love about old wow is that so many of the classes have ridiculous abilities like that which you can use to mess with people (on either faction).
---
warlock summoning people underwater/ritual that kills someone
---
priest mind control
---
hunter eyes of the beast to bait newbies into pvp flagging
---
rogues entire playstyle
---
etc
---
6 hours later, 277 up votes and your comment is at the top. Clearly you don't know what has taken over this community.
---
What?!
---
Well you cant have people in non layers interact with layered people your suggestion just would be have a layer for 1-20 and a layer for 21-60 
---
Meaning a 21 could never party with a 20 or lower or even see them and low level players would have the feel of a much smaller world. If anything I would stop it at 10 if you did level layering
---
Nobody can say it with certainty, but you can calculate probabilities based on known facts. From what I know the german playerbase was pretty much always stable in relation to the english eu wow player base. Does that translate 100% to classic? No, but it's certainly better than pulling something out of your ass.
---
&gt; some people act contrarian for the sake of being contrarion.
---
That's been a common 'argument' method in these threads, for sure. Had one argue that every country has the same education and media structure so there's no reason to treat anyone as special. Despite the obvious statistics saying otherwise. 
---
Stop thinking everyone is in the same boat and use some empathy for a moment rather than forcing them to do it your way because "they aren't special".
---
I guess we shall see. Did you report these ingame?
---
Lol sounds miserable, in fin i live in centrum flat 4 bedrooms 900 euros a month and shit i dont have to even work.
---
Spec into balance to assert dominance
---
If they're gonna make every server unofficially "English" servers, they need to add a rule so people can't talk in public channels in anything but English. 
---
I say that as someone who's first language \*isn't\* English, btw, so don't go pulling the "RACIST!"-card on me.
---
only with a proc
---
with batching, if you ignore batches you'll hit them randomly so you'll average toward the middle of a batch, being able to walk half as far into a blizzard as the video.  sometimes you'll get really lucky and walk as far as the video, sometimes you'll get really unlucky and the blizzard hits you as soon as you step in it.  players who get good at timing the batches can play that in their favor.
---
with the delay like it is, you just get the full duration every time and walk as far in the video every time like a perfect batch master without doing anything
---
Jk bro, haha
---
Undeads used to be human. Elves used to be trolls. I think that is the reasoning lorewise, good question actually!
---
&gt;What weight does your anecdotal example with SWG hold really? 
---
It's 16 years since then, so you can decide yourself. The situation was a bit different, because there were only US servers but EU players arranged them very well. But yeah, it was much in the past.
---
&gt; I can give you my example playing FFXIV as a Brit on an "unofficial  French Server" and the experience was absolute cancer .... majority of  groups would French only... not many english guilds. I had to transfer. 
---
Yes, and this is now happening to WoW Classic. Because directly after the announcement the movement was born to dictated which server is for which language.
---
I'm not against language specific servers in general, I'm against them when a part of the community decides them. It's the decision of Blizzard and they must act to change this.
---
Haha, broke my downvote record! 
---
This whole thread is some quality White Knight bait.
---
What are earth makes you think layering is more cost effective?
---
I didn't because I don't have access to the beta, but supposedly many people have.
---
it blows my mind that some people genuinely don't know those aren't a thing in classic wow (not hating on anyone, they did get released a long ass time ago)
---
This made me go and watch the full episode again haha
---
Imagine not purchasing a home until you’ve got several hundred thousand dollars cash. Some debt is expected and a regular part of life.
---
No dungeon finder in classic although it would be outrageously easy to get a group together for any dungeon if all you have to do is find three random dps who seem semi-competent
---
What you just proposed is seriously dumb
---
Rouge is super easy to play in PvE lol. Hunter is a lot Harder to play optimal
---
I don't mean access just to the beta. I mean access to the 1.12 reference client as well as the beta, so they can publicly confirm that damage values or whatever else that might be different can be verified and corrected if need be.
---
Name checks out lol
---
Probably a raid leader at some point.
---
For the time investment i wouldn't pick a class and role unless you know you'll like it.
---
If only we could all just speak Orcish. Like the Warchief intended.
---
That makes you an outlier. In America we have to work in order to make ends meet.
---
The letter is from desdmines not for deadmines that's a stockades quest basically
---
The very few hardcore guilds that are min maxing as hell Will require you to be dwarf, but few hardcore guilds =/= everyone. If you prefer night elf, then be night elf. That's it.
---
This gif has sound, I refuse to believe otherwise.
---
What the fuck? I came back to reddit for ten minutes for the first time in months and read this stupid shit right away, time to go away again
---
Yup, layering is a solution to the influx of people on launch that will eventually get bored and quit. By the time most people hit 60, over half the starting numbers will have quit, causing there to be vastly fewer players AND layers.
---
That worked on Feenix, but I'm pretty sure they don't behave like that on projects since.
---
Done
---
Meh, I resubbrd yesterday
---
“I thought you were specced to reduce cast time?”
---
Rank 11 to get the mounts, successful progression with hopefully getting our GM Scarab Lord, getting Atiesh (that's a huge wish tho), and just have a good reputation on the server :)

Masterminds
---
"didnt have a clue how to dps"
---
uh.... press shadowbolt?

Gotta give us some credit. Smart hunters will level engineering to be able to feign death and res healer during wipe.
---
&gt;Meme simplement pour discuter avec des gens sympas . et passer un bon moment . Devoir trouver des astuces , genre " Le Serveur X sera celui ou les FR doivent venir " ... c'est n'importe quoi .

Bingo. Ils pensent pouvoir mélanger tout les joueurs ensemble, mais au final, les joueurs vont faire la distinction eux-mêmes. Tout ce qui va arriver, c'est des maux de têtes pour tout le monde.
---
Bye.
---
I’m 99% positive they let everyone post on the Classic WoW forums, even those without a sub :)
---
you clearly have no idea what you are talking about. stop watching some edgy 0.1% vids and thinking they are meta.
---
Don't worry little one, you'll be an adult someday and won't suffer from such embarrassing overreactions to harmless exchanges between strangers on the internet.
---
We hope.
---
You'd be wrong
---
Fixing layering? I thought u guys wanted to get rid of it
---
&gt;These kinds of people think the world revolves around them.
---
The stereotypical American mentality, really. It's scary how true it is sometimes.
---
hunter is more complicated than rogue btw
---
they are just terrible dps
---
No layering whatsoever. If there have to be merges later on just deal with the problems then.
---
&gt; It was ok in 2005 
---
2005 had French and German servers, however.
---
Are you me
---
There has been a lot of talk about these tourists. I am really wondering now...what if Classic completely surpasses Blizzard's expectations and those "tourists" just become permanent players? How long will layering last then? I get that some people will leave Classic after a month or two, but what if the majority of players end up staying?
---
I hear ya, I think it's like 6:00 or 7:00 pm on the 26th when the servers go live for me.  I plan on coming home from work, taking a quick nap and then playing until I pass out - took the next 4 days off work.
---
Nope, that’s how it is. “Collect 20 scalps” means each player must loot 20 scalps, and if the drop rate is low, you could need to kill several times more than that to collect them all.
---
I cant wait.   I dont talk to my highschool people anymore except my wife.  I really want to have my daughter and nieces learn wow maybe get them interested in something more than barbie dream house tablet game.
---
Make healer die twice, nice!
---
Depends on who you run with. A guild group on voice comms communicating and at reasonable characters level for the content wont have many issues. But a pug group with everyone at the bottom of the level reqs, no coordination or communication, I wish them luck.
---
oh, well then I was totally wrong.  Carry on ;p
---
Those tiny small interactions that nobody knew about, as a private server player that was what interested me the most. Things like, how exactly DID onyxia breah mechanic work? What exactly was the proc rate of iron foe? Etc etc.
---
To think some of those tiny seemingly inconsequential changes will just be lost to time is a real shame.
---
In the dev documentary at blizzcon they mention that the backend order of how the server and client handle data changed internally. This means that the entire combat system likely functions entirely differently on the beta then it did in vanilla. Things like checking what buffs are on your character when a spell leaves your hand vs when it hits the mob. Realistically there's no way to account for every difference based on just playing the game. Or it could take years to discover all the nuances.
---
Whatever they have implemented is not batching nor does batching need to be in the game. What they have added to the game is some sort of artificial lag that seems to affect a lot of gameplay.  Im agreeing with you.
---
Vanilla launched with French and German servers in EU. Later they added Spanish and Russian servers, may have been the TBC pre-patch, maybe have been earlier. So not quite.
---
You're not going to be sitting in trade levelling to 40.
---
So by this you're arguing since relations are stable that the german/russian relation would be stable as well.
---
However...
---
1. (important) The reason they named for russian servers was their cyrillic alphabet. The size of their community has nothing to do with the officially stated reasoning.
---
2. While the relation may be stable, we don't know if the numbers will be high enough to warrant seperate servers. Launch interest will be super high, but what's important is long term player retention and we cannot know how many players will be playing in 6 months. Maybe everyone will be reminded how great properly designed games are and the game will explode beyond the launch interest because everyone gets sucked in just as they did 15 years ago. Maybe the hype will die down as the people who never played classic realize that this is not the type of game they enjoy and leave.
---
It appears apparent that Blizzard errs on the side of caution here and doesn't want to risk an infrastructure of dead local servers here.
---
I remember a lot of non English speakers on my ENG server back in the day.
---
You don't have to worry about Russian, because they are getting preferential treatment from Blizzard and will have their own separate servers.
---
rolled on a pvp in vanilla because of friends.
---
i dont enjoy ganking or being ganked whats basically the only reason to play on a pvp server.
---
i always ignored the opposite faction, i even help them out if i see them struggle. after a while you get a name for yourself as a friendly enemy and most just /wink and leave you be (there are obviously douchebags)
---
just be carefull around rogues, there is a reason why they roll that class
---
also top raidgroups on your server dont waste time ganking other raids (except worldboss ofcourse). there is a mutual respect and the competition is who gets to finish first.
---
This looks so fun! When did you get this?
---
well its less of an argument and more of an objective fact.  your inability to conceive of something has no relation to the existence of those things.
---
&gt;I've played a lot of MMOs in the past, and pretty much all of them will work in the sense that if I pick up a scorpion tail, both my friend and I will get credit for one tail.
---
That's not how it works.
---
- Dude asks you for 10 tails
---
- Dude asks your friend for 10 tails
---
- Dude expects 20 tails.
---
If you, as a group, collect 10, you haven't done what he's asked.
---
AND PEOPLE TOLD ME IT ISN'T AN ISSUE
---
Dont worry and enjoy the grind.
---
You're conflating a "slippery slope **argument**" (a type of logical fallacy) with "slippery slope" a common English metaphor.    
---
All "slippery slopes" are metaphors but not all "slippery slopes" are "slippery slope arguments" a [consequentialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequentialism) logical fallacy.
---
And this might be overestimating still! People don't want to except we're getting a handful of servers. The no language servers is just a symptom of the their other server decisions
---
Blizzard is very notorious for not fixing bugs in beta, not in the first couple weeks after launch, not in the first patch, and before you know it the next expac is out and the bugs are still there.
---
*so for this reason alone I won't resub to play Classic until I see that they have fixed the Hunter class and have removed layering... now I want to play Classic and they can have my money! but not until they get off their ass and fix the class I want to play and layering is not in the game*
---
Probably got his calendar wrong
---
Exactly!
---
Yeah feenix was where i played, but there was other Mangos servers that worked the same way.
---
Nah.
---
I'm not saying that it should be taken out entirely; just caution and follow the points I put forth. I agree this or something like this is necessary but it shouldn't be splitting up guilds. Also luxuries\*
---
:P
---
This makes me so fucking happy beyond belief... I can't wait for more people to try classic and see how bad retail is. Maybe blizzard will see their flaws and make a better world of warcraft.
---
I’d bet they release server names beforehand so people can plan ahead
---
You're contradicting yourself and proving yourself wrong now. First you say:
---
&gt; No they where not there was caps on server population that was no where near 10k
---
So there's nowhere near 10k players per server, yet now you say there's 30+ million players, so it's completely different compared to back then.
---
So which is it? Are millions of players going to flood each server and make it totally different, meaning layering is essential, or will it be the same as back then where it's packed with a few thousand players per server with the other millions of people playing the game being irrelevant?
---
Hmpf
---
merging a dead server to an active server will hurt the economy and community a lot less than the inevitable transfers off the popular server after they drop layering
---
the pet AI has been broken for Cthulhu knows how long in retail... and it looks like they are not going to have it fixed in Classic as it stands
---
That logic is just wrong. I do not have time to wait 2 hours just to start to play WoW. I'll take a month of layering over insane queues.
---
TBC's endgame was strictly superior to Classic's. You cannot seriously defend the debuff limit. The debuff lmit does nothing to enhance the class flavor. It only serves to limit gameplay, because the servers at the time couldn't handle it. 
---
Warlock has more flavor with teh ability to cast dots thant he ability not to cast DoTs. 
---
The debuff limit is so crippling that I'd go so far to say that hard solo content is exponentially more engaging than raiding content specificalyl because you have access to your entire spellbook. How can you defend Warlocks spamming Shadow bolt from pull to kill? How is that good gameplay, how do you diferentiate yourself from mage on a moment to moment basis. Outside of utility, due to the debuff limit crippling classes' spell count, many classes have the exact same rotation. 
---
Class uniqueness matters, it matters so much, but the debuff limit adds nothing to that concept, and I'd go so far as to say it's crippling to class identity. I would play warlock in 2.4.3 because I have access to dots and other debuffs, but I would never consider touching a warlock in classic because I only get to play utility and press shadow bolt ad nausium. Compare SB spam to the dynamic nature of warlock in the open world or PvP, warlocks are fucking boring as fuck in raid, but they're great outside of it. Many classes and specs in classic have genuinely good gameplay and are a ton of fun, if they can have their debuffs. The design is already there, it's just gated by the debuff limit. 
---
TBC even goes farther by making support specs, giving unique incentives to run every spec in the game, for a buff or for direct damage. I would argue that the TBC system, reduced debuff limits and unique party buffs across the board, offers better class and spec uniqueness. Your gameplay isnt crippled by the debuff limit, and every spec has its own niche and value. 
---
You overlooked his entire point on everything, and said a bunch of buzzwords people agree with. Nothing you said is wrong. Nothing you said addresses his greviences with the debuff limit.

The debuff limit is garbage design caused by technical problems. It likely wasnt the intended experience for the game, and it actively hurts the endgame gameplay. Gating the best rewards behind content that's frankly really  fucking boring for a great deal of classes is idiotic. If I go from using 10+ buttons in the open world, to spamming frost bolt ad nausium, I'm not going to have a good time. Classic shouldn't see changes, but that doesnt change the fact that the debuff limit was retarded, bad design, and was imediately removed in favor of a strictly superior system in the next expansion. Nothing is lost with the removal of the debuff limit. 
---
Retail's system is a garbage fire. Classic's class and spec identity are really good. TBC's is strictly better than classic's. I dont see why you're comparing classic's to retail's system when TBC is the sollution to the objective issues the other dude brought up.
---
Well I’m assuming the worst on all other iterations of server population control on launch. I don’t really mind that some guys can mine a few more nodes than normal or avoid being camped if it means everyone being able to play the game instead of waiting in a queue, or phasing out from people I am currently playing with. 
---
There’s no good solution and I understand the criticism, but it really seems like it’s queue vs layering and I choose layering every time. Because in only one of those situations, everyone gets to play the game, and when they play they won’t have to wait for kobolds to spawn because there’s 100 people in northshire abbey all stealing the tap, or wait for hours on phased quests like escort quests etc. 
---
I don’t like waiting in lines.
---
I agree, it's unlikely that these issues will be fixed before launch (or even after that). It's a shame because I planned to main a hunter as well. Not going to deal with this shit though...
---
So can anyone tell me what Classic is all about? Is this basically a relaunch of the original vanilla?
---
Because no other class has to farm a late 20's dungeon to be viable as a druid tank or dps at end game content. It's kind of a big deal.
---
I am gonna stick it out and hope for the best!
---
&gt; german/russian relation would be stable as well. (did I get that right?)
---
No I haven't really followed the russian population.
---
&gt; While the relation may be stable, we don't know if the numbers will be high enough to warrant seperate servers. 
---
That doesn't matter. Just offer free server transfers if the pop gets to low. It's really not that complicated. Solves the layering issue as well.
---
&gt; It appears apparent that Blizzard errs on the side of caution here and doesn't want to risk an infrastructure of dead local servers here.
---
No it appears that Blizzard is tone deaf on both ears as always until shit hits the fan. Remember why we are in this situation in the first place: You think you do, but you don't.
---
Still waiting for people to stop referring to vanilla as classic, they are two different games.
---
I went with 5 because it’s reasonable to expect NA will be getting 1 PVP, 1 PVE, and 1 RP for each coast. NA only has a slightly larger player base (11%) than EU, so if they’re getting 6, EU is probably getting 5. But it’s also possible that NA will only get 1 RP realm, so who knows.
---
Australia and South America will have to connect to the US Pacific realm(s). Sucks for them.
---
1. Vanilla isn't fast paced game (but can become one if you minmax and duo level. Put in the effort, and you'll see the results)
---
2. Managing resources restricts you from being good? I never heard that one. If anything, this is why the Retail casters are so unenjoyable, because your mana bar is just cosmetic. Why does it even exist? It's a resource that must be spent correctly.
---
3. Yes. That's up to personal taste however, what we find fun and what we don't. Mage is really just Frostbolt and one of your AOE spells in PvE, but it has insane skill ceiling in PvP. I suggest you try that.
---
4. Get good then if you don't want to waste time with corpseruns.
---
5. No. Just SO no. Early levels, druids and shamans outperform warrior tanks. Starting at level 20, tankadins become very good as well. If anything, tank warriors are the worst tanks for leveling (but do kick in during the later levels). On the raiding scene however, Shaman tanking obviously falls off (although it would be kinda neat to see someone make it work (remember, viable =/= optimal! I'm asking for it to be viable, if someone found a way)), tankadins are a nice off tank but not the best - they are very flexible though, and the best AoE tanks -, Warriors are obviously good tanks, but Feral tanking is especially very good. A full time Feral offtank is the best thing ever.
---
I understand that the original topic is about your personal enjoyment, but you made claims that are just dumb.
---
Merge guilds and characters with name conflicts, merge entire server economies... it is not trivial to merge servers. It is trivial to merge layers because the economy is shared and mane and guilds are unique across layers...
---
Ooh I really like this idea. Very seamless.
---
lol, imagine being you
---
When are you learning Cantonese? Korean? Russian?
---
Doesn’t explain how i’ve had clinical depression for 10+ years.. 13-23 that would be. Never had debt in my life!

Sure. There's more countries than Germany, France and Spain. But those do make up ~40%. Ultimately, [49% of adults in Europe can't speak English.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_the_European_Union) 
---
You're bound to get some insular communities, regardless of national servers, and they can't possibly accommodate for all of them (Hungarian, Polish etc.) - But that doesn't change the fact that vanilla **did** have servers for some of the biggest ones.
---
Need to be what

---
I feel like its a necessary evil, but a poorly executed one at that. There are better ways to do it in the clusters that were previously mentioned by another comment. I want to time travel to play classic WoW but not time travel to see my computer and servers explode simultaneously.
---
That’s just how vanilla is. They made it easier in later expansions but in vanilla if a quest asks you to collect 6 bear dicks and you’re in a group with a friend then be prepared to slay 12 bears for their dicks.
---
It's important here we distinguish between "Drop Quests", "Object/Pickup Quests", and "Kill Quests".  
---
Drop Quests - Each player must loot items abc of type xyz from the corpses of mobs. Drops \*may\* be shared across party for rare grinds, but usually not.  
---
Object Quests - Each player must loot items abc of type xyz from objects on the ground containing them. The objects typically are in static locations and respawn within a few minutes.  
---
Kill Quests - Each player must kill mobs abc in a specified area. Credit is shared within party if party members are within range of each other.  
---
You could set the loot to Free For All and just let each other go nuts for the items, but that can get messy. Also even after one person is done the quest they must check a mob's corpse for loot before you can loot your quest item. Setting it to FFA \*should\* remove this requirement.
---
Wtf i’d move there in a heartbeat.. from australia with a $14 min wage.
---
Everything cost double and I hate the drinking culture “your bad cause you smoke weed” says the person casually downing 10 pints in a few hours.
---
This needs to get upvoted more. If frost is worried about layering, I am worried about layering.
---
People need to stop considering themselves casual if they don’t care, or hardcore if they do to realize this as a HUGE issue.
---
It will, as he said, wreck the economy for the first phase. Even if it affects hardcore players the most, people will abuse it, and it will widen the gap between casuals and elites, and just might as well be slapped as retail because you can do the same thing there.
---
The game will be fun, make no mistake. But anyone with half a brain can see the implications and adverse effects that this will cause with such easy manipulation/abuse. 
---
It’s like steroids with athletes, damned if you do, damned if you don’t.
---
ohai. i was eredar alliance at first and rerolled horde in wotlk.
---
Haa I rerolled Alliance later on, but on another realm.
---
Nowadays, Portuguese server is just a server in the list of English servers, but with (português) appended to the end.
---
It's better to have different languages under different tabs, though. Because there shouldn't be cross-realm anyway, there's no advantage to different language servers having a region indicator in parenthesis and being lumped under the same sever category when they can just be listed under a different tab.
---
4gb size... :D hype is real
---
Hunter vs Elemental Shaman is probably one of the most balanced at the high-end. Hunter vs Mage can be interesting with skilled players. A good Mage beating a Warlock is always fun to watch.
---
How long will it take me to download that much RAM at 56k?
---
you act like learning another language just to play a video game is a requirement. Hint. no it's fucking not.
---
What do you mean? They've already confirmed there will be RP realms on both EU and NA. It's RP-PvP that's in question.
---
Wow. So all I gotta do is wait a few weeks and then these will be accurate. 
---
Since you can’t show me the realm population when release drops I’ll just come back later
---
"I was only pretending to be a moron!"
---
people are allowed to be annoyed if they are on a streamer server on accident. Its gonna be full of retards like you following 'sodah'
---
While reading your post up until your last sentence I was like "Dude, Naxx is vanilla!!!" xD
---
I agree with you on Naxx though - the instance is absolutely perfect. I think it's the best instance/raid Blizzard has ever created. I'm not sure if you know it, but the reason they added it in wotlk was because (and to the best of my memory) they stated that only about 1% of the player pool got to experience it in vanilla, and they wanted more than that to try it.
---
I really hope Blizzard sees this Classic release as a new/second chance to give give us new updates while keeping the gameplay that we know and love from vanilla (and not doing lvl 60-&gt;70-&gt;120 all over again), but with new cool instances similar to Naxx. My heart would explode of happiness if that happened!

You’re crazy in the coconut

“You can’t be the dwarf character Butters, I’m the dwarf.”
---
It would literally only affect Affliction locks in raid. Where is the harm?
---
Transfer is not a thing unless they do a server split or a mass migration. It is hard to predict one way or the other. If they go lots of realms route it is a guarantee lots of them will go dead after a big portion of ppl reduce playtime.
---
The layering route would affect only extremely populated servers, we talking 30k+
---
If this were a screenshot from beta, you'd have a point. But this is a screenshot from retail. You don't have a point.
---
a lot of people were wanting no layering in the first pvp zones (i.e. stv) and beyond anyway, so if you combine the 2 ideas then it's fine.
---
and i thought it couldnt get worse, just stop
---
Not on the larger projects, since like 2016.
---
Thus far I've seen like 5 changes that are a direct result of them using bfa client instead the real vanilla one as the baseline for classic... It gets more and more unauthentic...
---
Yep, just be.
---
Man I wish I had this in school. We just spent lunchtimes and music class playing wow tcg. This would've definitely been a step up. These things are like £300 now.
---
Remind me to be on the lookout for Horrible People 1-5....
---
if you're down to read the actual backstory pm me
---
Excuse you, layering is gone within the first few weeks, once phase 2 rolls around. The lack of language servers is forever.
---
Only by mobs, it's supposed to always work in PvP.
---
Damn.....2100 is my Model 3, RAV4, and almost 2k sqft house in Jacksonville FL. I'm in a neighborhood I won't get stabbed in. You should look for a job in a place with better housing. Sometimes moving is the right thing to do even if it is hard. 
---
Then again, come classic WoW I'll probably have to sell everything after my wife divorces me for playing too much, so there is that.
---
People seem to miss an important point : blizzard fired more than 800 employees in 2019, mainly in support teams.
---
In France, 134 employees are about to be fired.
---
Of course it directly translates into:less support so less servers. 
---
This server decision is the direct consequence of the stupid Activision Blizzard decision to save more money to add to their 6+ billions they made through 2018.
---
So this is not about game play, strategy, restoring wow or whatever. It's just economical. And I fear there is nothing the community can do so blizz cancels it's decision.
---
That hardly covers it.
---
Got a video of the delay on freezing trap?
---
Lmao holy shit. I feel like im from venuzuela
---
They have the whole ball of wax.
---
plus you had sarth+3 to dig into a bit, that was a fun one.. and other challenges like going for the immortal in naxx
---
I was 12 in my first raid. It taught me how to act towards a common goal with real adults. Taught me to be on time for meetings and how to coordinate problems like an adult.
---
I wish I enjoyed retail the way retail players do. I love the highest end of raid progression and all of that. The problem was sitting through the same raid 3 times minimum before I even look at Mythic. I really don’t like having an end boss on farm while progressing mythic. Its overexposure for me. 
---
Also the treadmill nature - I spent 2 weeks on BFA release gearing for the opening raids and before they came out they introduced Warfronts meaning every bit of gear you obtained prior was worthless - go do Warfronts sixteen times and hope.
---
Fuck that noise.
---
Yeah, can’t say the same...
---
Yeah, be careful with them. They're even worse than me...
---
Backstap, kidney punch or garotte
---
Nearly same exact story here! My 2 good friends and I would have LAN parties at my house every weekend and during the summer. Up until 5-7AM, and then sleep for 5-6 hours, wake up and do it again! Until around Cata when we started barely playing at all (for obvious reasons). Now we’re all coming back!
---
Its not over til the Shizzard releases the game.
---
Yeah good luck getting a rogue out of stealth with Arcane Explosion before he gets a sap off. While yeah rogues could still sap you if they ran in in the middle of your GCD for a sap before your Arcane Explosion went off. With this leeway it's going to be basically impossible to get a rogue out of stealth with it if the leeway doesn't get fixed.
---
I've been in all 3, it was fine. I grouped up naturally 3 or 4 times for caves and a DM attempt. People were mostly friendly. One guy was sniping mobs rudely in an area it was just us 2, but whatever.
---
If someone didnt buff you, maybe they were new or retail players and just didn't know they could. Doesn't mean they were being rude purposely. It's like real life, not everyone is friendly, not everyone wants to group or be social. In the long run it's still going to be miles better that retail.
---
15/15 Naxx atm.
---
if your raid insists on fear ward, tell them there tanks are trash and should learn to stancedance like every horde tank can and needs to.

play what you like. stairing hundrets of hours on some pixel ass it better be a good one
---
*if they don't mind carrying you
---
&gt;  I thought mages were a purely human and elven thing, and the other races had their own kind of magic users?
---
Well yes and no. The arcane was practically exclusively practiced en masse by Quel'thalas and Kirin Tor mages, definitely. That said, Zandalari trolls far predate both and have always been very active in magic use. Therefor it stands to reason that some of those would have arcane knowledge which might have been passed on to Darkspear. 
---
That said, since WC3 has no mention of Troll mages (granted, a lot of race/class combos of course weren't there) the more obvious explanation would be that Trolls (who are known to be quite perceptive and cunning) have learned their skills from Forsaken in recent years. Which, of course, include massive portions of former Human mages.
---
The current retail version of WoW has this feature, so you probably won't get much support for it from a "classic" WoW enthusiast.
---
Sounds like someone is indiscriminately killing female bears for no reason.
---
Then why advocate for #nochanges? Seems hypocritical
---
As long as it's client specific - I hate looking at upright orcs. Been staring at the disfigured spine for a bit too long.
---
shield block is better than anything you've mentioned
---
That'd actually be OK with me - give me the *option* of a #nochanges server and you guys can have your not-so-subtle retail technical mechanics for your characters.
---
No, but it has been reported by multiple people, including Frostadamus for example.
---
As a northern swede myself, I second this.
---
I also second your opinion on language specific servers.
---
I still hear his voice often dude its really weird. Typing this I can hear his old silly youtube videos in my head.

They say a person dies 3 times, once at death, twice when the last people to know them dies and last the final time there name is said.

John Baine is in my mind, he’s still with us for another 60+ years in our minds.

Warlock vs Priest

Retribution VS Rogue

Elemental VS Shockadin
---
&gt; No I haven't really followed the russian population.
---
Then I don't understand how your argument about the predictability of relative community sizes (english german) relates to the argument up to that point :(
---
&gt;That doesn't matter. Just offer free server transfers if the pop gets to low. It's really not that complicated. Solves the layering issue as well.
---
Sure. I'm merely explaining their thought process. I'absolutely agree with you on that there should be language based servers with a planB for when one such server turns out dead 6 months later (merging, free transfers, ...)
---
&gt;No it appears that Blizzard is tone deaf on both ears as always until shit hits the fan. Remember why we are in this situation in the first place: You think you do, but you don't.
---
How is this about tone deafness (yet)? They made a decision and we're currently in the process of trying to get them to change this decision. If they come out and say they won't listen to us and stick with their decision instead, then you call them tone deaf. Right now they just made a (questionable) choice that the community disagrees with and their choice is likely the result of them erring on the side of caution concerning server infrastructure and potential upcoming problems with it (having to merge, offer free transfers). I don't agree with that choice by them (have posted in the thread the OP linked) but it has not yet anything to do with tone deafness, unless there was a discussion about this beforehand and they ignored the community. Was there?
---
Yeah I’m good with not owing debt to a 1 million + dollar home.
---
No changes! Except when I want changes.
---
no, but learning English before going on English speaking games is a requirement imo

I came back in Legion after Classic announcement. First time subbing since a month after Cata. I had like four other RL friends do the same, so it wasn't a a lonely journey and I actually enjoyed it for a bit before BFA came. The classes without artifacts just lost all identity and BFA itself was a bit boring so I stopped a month after that dropped. 
---
Retail is missing difficulty, class identity, and community. Give me two of the three and I could have fun and still sub, but it just ended up losing me since none were there when my RL dropped back off the game as well.
---
Anyone planning on aoe grinding in the first few months should rethink that strategy.
---
You might find an empty tier 1 spot once in a while, but to actually beat normal leveling via questing you need solo access to the spot uninterrupted for an extended amount of time. There are a few spots that can sustain 2 people (Hillsbrad comes to mind), but they are rare.
---
I’ll hit a spot for a while if it’s empty, but as soon as someone starts to interfere it’s not worth it.
---
(This is all from the perspective that you care most about leveling speed)
---
Menos mal. Jaja!
---
Probably better for the enviroment without it though; it's worth it ;)
---
The new models are half the reason I won't touch retail. No.
---
I'm Australian. It wasn't a thing for me + my friends at least. I was of drinking age at the start of the 2000s, so it may have been previously
---
&gt; I'm playing tauren unless they add this option. Thoughts?
---
Sounds like you'll be playing tauren lol
---
hey you got the joke glad it landed
---
I personally had a better experience in the latest test than the previous ones. I felt people were more cooperative and willing to help vs spamming nonsense and trolling. I was able to group up with more people and complete quests faster.
---
Ambush. 
---
That’s it.
---
Nice! Thanks for the tag. This is cool.
---
You’re in the minority if your first home is worth anywhere close to a million dollars.
---
\#metoo!
---
Yeah, with Cata, of course, let's keep praising WotLK despite everything and ignore the fact that everything started with it, just blame Cata for everything. Maybe game is changed and many people don't like changes, but it's still seems like people have become so much stricter about any change after LK death
---
Wow thanks !!
---
Guess you don't get it, okay dude.
---
I CAN'T FUCKING STAND ANOTHER ONE OF THESE FUCKING POSTS! HOW MANY TIMES DO WE HAVE TO REPEAT THE SAME THING?! PLAY WHAT YOU WANT.
---
I used to get terrible screen tearing until I bought more RAM. Couldn’t even let lakes, rivers etc. into my FOV.
---
you will lose CPs if you hit another target with a spell. can't have CPs in more than one target.
---
Classic will probably be ran on AMD EPYC 2..which is as powerful as a whole server room was back in 2004. 1 64 core EPYC chip can run an entire server.
---
Hunters are relatively low when you compare modern unofficial servers, however. Which are at least players most likely to stick with the game long-term.
---
Layers are continent wide not zone wide so if you get ahead of the zerg you're gonna be pretty much alone on your layer while all the others are in the low level areas.
---
See I'm the opposite. DPS sounds so dumb. Press the same 2 or 3 buttons in the same way order over and over.
---
When you heal, yes you fill up bars, but every fight is different, you have to be good at predicting / reacting while still following mechanics. It's actually more to do and less dull.
---
Only drawback is when you want a minimalistic ui
---
I miss these times

You realize this stress test was open to anyone with a subscription, right?

Honestly indifferent to whether world buffs are up or not as this content will be cleared easy (world buffs wont make it easier but noobs like you think thats true)
---
Lol nope, believe it or not people actually do watch him and enjoy his content
---
With 16 debuff slots in the 1.12 patch you can be the guild shadow priest to stack the debuff, its not amazing butt it's something.
---
I mean you have different intentions behind but.. yes that is an option. Gonna be gona after a few weeks or months anyway. Its not like the server will only be up for a limited time.
---
Hey at least you know it now.
---
In classic it's nearly always CS. Garrote is almost never used and ambush only when someone is very low and you're sure you can kill them in 2 seconds - other than that cheap shot is nearly always better.  
---
A very typical fight is:  
---
 CS-&gt; Backstab-&gt; Gouge... -&gt; KS -&gt; 2x Backstab -&gt; CB Evis.
---
This. I don’t get how people who were initially #nochanges come around to layering. The only solid argument i’ve heard is “its 2019, I don’t have the time to spend in Q or fighting for mob tags” 
---
And my go to response is “wait til a few weeks after release, it will die down” they act all surprised and like i’m trying to be a dick.
---
Vanilla release was different purely because the game wasn’t popular but look to BC and LK releases - everyone on the server funneled into a few zones. It was a shitshow, the strong prevailed and the weak waited for it all to die down.
---
How we went from there to layering being acceptable is beyond me.
---
Thanks :)
---
I think you misunderstand, Classic doesn't have Guild Banks.  
---
OP is asking how GMs are going to keep track of items that belong to the Guild that are dispersed among the members.
---
But you're right to a degree, I expect someone will come up with an addon to track Guild assets and which accounts they are on.
---
Ya....and u could function just fine if you ran out of powder and poisons....a hunter without arrows is useless. Awful comparison.
---
Inns as layerfree zones would be so RPey. 
---
It'd make Inns into places where people meet to group up and quest together, just like in RP stories, where the mercenaries meet in bars and inns to discuss their quest and set out from there.
---
They've been pretty clear on their intentions for release. And they aren't the type of company to make huge changes based on beta feedback, especially when that feedback is obviously coming from a sub-section of the community. I mean hell, go look at the official beta forum, layering is barely even brought up there.
---
Fuck it, let's do it. Where do I have to sign ?
---
stealth -&gt; follow -&gt; wait for target to pull 3-4 mobs
---
You're taking this too seriously
---
By the end of BC I was done with the game. I hated farming dailies and could only enjoy WotLK when I was stoned out of my mind. Which is not a good reason to play a game.
---
I've tried all of the other expansions and they all just got worse and worse. Now, I don't mean to say that you're wrong in liking the expansions I hate. It's fine for us to have differing opinions, at the end of the day we still love the same game; just vastly different versions. Technically, the current retail version of the game is superior. But when it comes to that sense of adventure, achievement and community, it just hasn't been there since BC.
---
As for your comment on the dungeon finder, the issue that I, and I assume most, have with the feature was not the quality of the players. I honestly think that on average, the old LFG PUGs had worse players. Though this was likely largely due in part to two things: a higher overall difficulty and people not having any idea how to play. The real issue with the dungeon finder, for me, is that it takes away from the overall experience of the game.
---
This is the case with the vast majority of the changes implemented post-BC (and don't get me wrong, BC had it's negative changes as well, i.e. dailies). They were mostly quality of life changes that seemed great at the time, but ended up having unexpected effects on the core of the game. As many have said, these changes made the game less challenging and more streamlined. Unfortunately this also made the game less rewarding and really destroyed the old community aspect of the game. Without those things, to me, World of Warcraft lost something essential: the actual world of Warcraft.
---
Vanilla WoW had a pretty smooth expansion in terms of players (after that initial fiasco) 
---
Its hard for them to replicate organic growth of a game. I still don’t think layering is the answer.
---
Go shadow, and make him your personal peeler. (I'm actually going holy pal to be my bf's personal healer qq)
---
Imagine making a changes post in this sub lol.
---
Mages are doomed in PvP with leeway.
---
&gt; still cant see scissors.
---
Time to stack Felhunter Paranoia and Human Perception.
---
"Starting zones are going to be heavily layered". 
---
Layering is not a zone specific tech, it cannot directly do what you say. What blizz will do however is lower the cap on each layer during the initial start. Maybe 1k per layer. Then as people spread out up it to 3k per layer. 
---
But those 1k players can be anywhere, they could all be in the same starting area. Blizz can only indirectly try to balance zones by reducing total players using layering. The tech that balances by zone is called sharding, it is what retail uses, and they have decided not to use that for classic. So some popular zones will still be overcrowded and unpopular ones less so.
---
Hahahahahaha
---
I I  like hello kitty adventure better
---
I just want to see it. It’s also not on the list linked in the edit that I could see.
---
Interested in knowing if it’s the trap set delay and is being confused as a delay of application. Or if maybe batching is being applied to freezing trap (which you would think should happen).
---
Yes many changes that have lead WoW to where it is today started  during Wrath, the last patch or two if memory serves me right. However Wrath was still a great expansion. The changes they implemented have taken time to run their respective courses.
---
If both players are decent, mage loses every time. 
---
But if you’re very slippery and can keep making them shift, you have an outside shot. But they’ll probably just run away if they sense they’re losing. In wpvp just run unless you have a few levels on him.
---
It's literally a video game, if you have no other real life reasons to need to learn a language, then you shouldn't have to learn another language to play the game unless you absolutely want to learn the language for your own enjoyment.
---
“Looked and felt horrible” ok but walking outside of a city and seeing players appear before your eyes isn’t?
---
What about the people who accept an invite to party in a remote area and suddenly everything flips?
---
Cause to me thats jarring as fuck for Vanilla.

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c3vwaq/they_should_do_gnome_druids_with_their_animal/). 
---
This isn’t because of layering. The beta is just barren right now.
---
[https://youtu.be/k1t0A1cqGcw](https://youtu.be/k1t0A1cqGcw)
---
Seems a bit hypocritical.  Players can get vanilla but others shouldnt get TBC or WOTLK?
---
If you really want to try-hard; Sap, (restealth), cheap shot, cancel attack, expose armor, cancel attack, wait for DR reset, cheap shot &gt; go crazy.
---
How does this even has upvotes ? EU had german and french servers at launch.
---
Just shows that people have no clue what they're talking about
---
I spent HS playing MTG. Have a complete alpha, and beta set.
---
I just saw it pop up in my launcher today too. Does that mean I'm in the beta? I'm not currently subbed and I don't want to pay a sub unless I can actually play.
---
Given about everything they've shown us so far regarding their commitment to classic has been very positive. Assuming otherwise just for the sake of being a default redditor is sinmply not reasonable.
---
the worry is that there's still a mountain of bugs, 2 months definitely isn't enough time to deal with all of them.
---
it's good of course to find and deal with the bugs, my point was simply that the game will be more buggy for a while because of the path they took.
---
Okay. You can tell that to everyone who has to change their names. 
---
Wait. When has Blizzard *ever* merged servers before anyway?
---
Why would they do it now? 
---
Sorry. It’s in. See you on the 27th
---
This guys is trolling harder than the Ooga Gang
---
Your actually just being an asshole, trust me i would know.
---
no, I'm playing the game where words mean things.  I know, hard to understand.
---
Biggest problem with that is people will race to level 15 or 20  (probably 19), and park themselves at the arena, collecting those sweet arena tokens in layers that aren't accessible to anyone else.
---
Of course, the easiest solution here would be to not put that event in til phase 2.
---
That’s the point.  LK *started* with the issues that killed WoW, but it was still at a point where it was very similar to vanilla.  It was still great and then cata came out and amplified every bad system LK had tenfold.  If you need specific examples id be glad to provide you with them.
---
Always wanted to get into MTG but it didn't seem worth it after wow tcg after I invested so much into it and only had a friend or two into that. Do you still play often?
---
One of the biggest ones and for a good reason. It's objectively extremely well written. The slapstick humor is amazing and way beyond the many shitty comedies we get on TV/Netflix nowadays.
---
The world lacks good slapstick. I miss Leslie Nielsen. (in case anyone cares, Angie Tribeca is a pretty good slapstick comedy series in the style of Leslie Nielsen movies)
---
Yeah, it's likely that spell batching is involved which causes the delay. If I find some kind of evidence I will link it to you.
---
I agree with this
---
I don’t see Garrosh in there
---
Honestly, I think that most of the people who are against language-specific servers are under the unfounded impression that English is somehow the majority in Europe (it isn't), and that they will come out on top in a free for all.
---
I can't wait for them to find out how wrong they were about that, when their servers end up becoming mainly played by players of non-English languages.
---
indeed. same here.
---
am at lvl 108 in retail.. and it just a job.,
---
In the stress test,, spent 4-5 hrs leveling the dwarf hunter to level 9, got a two hand axe with massive 2.0 dps, and learned engineering so I could make by own ammo.
---
Had more fun in those 5 hours playing a melee hunter, than I do in retail playing pally/warrior/etc in retail.
---
I know where I will be spending my time when classic comes out..
---
Depending on your spec, Backstab can actually be better than Ambush.
---
Some were there to troll and nothing else. Since right click report isn’t there and it was just a temporary stress test, no one will have then  name Loadofcum once it’s live. 
---
Some were potatoes that didn’t know to train spells and didn’t get those buffs. Person I played with was a legion baby and didn’t realize mark of the wild was a buff that could be cast on others then didn’t realize it only buffed one at a time instead of party after being explained it was a buff. 
---
The trolls will get blacklisted and the potatoes will learn
---
Having 500 in a zone designed for 50 is terrible, don’t be a dumbass.
---
Dis comment gonna age real well, cant wait RemindMe! 3 months
---
I was referring to the literal meaning of the word queue.
---
There shouldn’t be 10k on a server anyway. You can find the podcast were the WoW dev explicitly states that server cap was NOT a technical limitation but instead a design choice to foster a sense of community..
---
Increasing the server cap changes the whole design philosophy. If it was 2.5k before, 10k is fucking stupid.
---
The "live" version is what was used for this weeks stress test. The beta one is what was used for earlier stress tests. They are left in now so people can uninstall them through the launcher, but you might as well leave the live one installed, as that is what Classic will use on the real launch.
---
In reality the way they talked about servers sounds likely that there will only be 1 RP server at launch for each region. The way they spoke in interviews sounded like VERY little amount of servers total. It wouldn't surprise me if at best we only had 2 RP servers on US and 1-2 for EU
---
&gt; How is this about tone deafness (yet)?
---
Tone deaf in this case was more a metaphor for just being out of touch with the community. But also because it seems they don't give a fuck about europe. From what I know there haven't been any european stress tests.
---
&gt; (merging, free transfers, ...)
---
It's pretty clear at this point that they don't want to do this, hence we have layering and probably way too few servers at launch even if you count all the people who won't continue within the first couple of months. Call me cynical or disillusional, but I predict now that either they layer shit out of every realm for a looooong time or there will be long queue times.
---
Language realms will happen and if Blizzard don't support them officially, they will just be enforced by the community.
---
But the most important reason why we need region based realms is that to get the true classic experience. Thats how it was back in the days. Without language based realms something is missing for EU players, it wouldn't feel like classic.
---
Can we seriously have more than 4 hours without seeing this dudes face?  
---
If you like him that’s great, I personally think he is tolerable but it’s a little much  that every time I look at this sub there is a recent post about him.  
---
Can we keep it to actually wow?
---
Games evolve and change and you either like it or not.. maybe that’s where classic will come in for you and you’ll enjoy it better 🤷🏼‍♀️
---

---
This is the issue. I don’t want a congested starting zone on release either but the options are that or layering. 
---
Layering: Pro’s
---
- Smooth Server Launch
---
Cons:
---
- Not Blizzlike / Vanilla
---
- Heavily exploitable
---
-Decreases immersion
---
Sounds like a good trade to me..
---
Well for one it was just an example I pulled out of thin air, and for two, did you read my statement?
---
The rationale is that Blizzard is assuming off of available data via surveying and publicly available data that servers for specific languages will probably die out. Retail servers aren't the best example because retail has had low population issues for a long time, and it's detrimental to what they're trying to accomplish with classic servers. On live, you can circumvent low population realms by cross server play, which isn't available in Classic.
---
As an addendum, I figure the cost benefit analysis ran in support for multiple languages probably wasn't as high as they'd like it to be.
---
The statement
---
I can see why a warrior would love having a priest buddy, but was approaching from the perspective of a priest choosing their preferred partner. My feeling is that priest/rogue or priest/druid or priest/shaman would be better.
---
Played a human warrior in classic. This past stress test my love for classic warrior was rekindled. I will be rolling a undead warrior this time around tho.
---
&gt; Auto-shot bugged (Sometimes has an unexpected delay, causing you to accidentally clip the next shot) 
---
I thought this was just me, it was really messing with my head, lol.
---
&gt; Pet control bugged (Often only attacks once before automatically returning to the player. Pathfinding is buggy as well) 
---
There is more going on with this but its hard to put a finger on exactly, hopefully blizzard can figure it all out before launch
---
Mid/late Tier 5, but yes I agree
---
The idea is to get fat and disgusting after playing for months like in the show, not to start there.
---
Would it also be better if the druids didnt roll om gear until all other healers had all they wanted first?
---
Find a fun RP guild, and make some new friends.
---
Be a blacksmith/ armorsmith and level it while I level.  Try to wear as much self-crafted gear as I can.
---
God forbid we try to discuss huge issues with the game pre-release. It should just be memes for entertainment guys, pack it up.
---
I'd much rather see a more regular amount of players in the zones questing along with me, than to see hundreds all together killing the same mobs with a 1 second respawn time. The former feels good, the latter feels like a clusterfuck.
---
Wtf, has this been confirmed ?
---
There will be enough players to populate 50 servers minimum. It's just weird how much blizzard under estimates classic
---
&gt; with a french and german server.
---
I think both french and german came with a little bit more than one server on launch. And germany had something like 40-60 servers on peak time I think (somewhere in Wotlk).
---
Get the hand of rag on my enhance shammy!
---
Is this the same one I saw a few days ago? The one I saw showed the ones that I had been fixed and ones that were possibly actually working as intended (green and yellow background respectively)
---
Zug Zug
---
Armor looks horribad on them, the shoulders are just out of place and misaligned and the helmets are still modeled to leave space for the humped back, so they either have a flap of armor sticking horizontally protecting jackshit or they just not cover half their napes.
---
Cant stand them either. They way they run is ridiculous.
---
for me it's farming cindercloth cloak, farming crusader enchant and getting all the limited vendor recipes and patterns
---
&gt; Initimidation is not being triggered when the attack absorbs. "Not sure if this is a bug or not, but I could not find anyone mentioning that it would not trigger upon absorbs? The tooltip indicates any successful melee attack i.e. not a miss/parry/dodge." 
---
So I don't specifically remember intimidation not working on absords, but I do know that having your melee attack absorbed is treated as a 'miss' in the game for all intents and purposes for melee classes.
---
Yeah, the pet control has been bugged in retail for years now... Actually boggles my mind that they haven't been able to fix it yet.
---
Another channel?
---
Cute bug. People did this kind of thing in 2005, too. There were a couple of spots where clever jumping could hide you very well, often outside of 'game areas.' I kind-of hope they use the old Warsong map, with all of its dumb glitches. Does anyone know if the logs in the middle of the map will block LOS?  
---
Side note, you saw some of this on private servers. But ironically, people were probably more scared to 'cheat' on those servers because they were likely to face a permanent ban if caught.
---
Spot on.
---
I've played WoW since day 1 in vanilla and quit shortly before wotlk ended, and then I've played a bit on an off since. I used to know where every single instance was up until the dungeon tool was added - since then, I had absolutely no idea where the new dungeons were located anymore. Such a shame. One of the things I really enjoyed back in the days (even though - admittedly - it could be a pain in the ass aswell some times) was to form a group of people by spamming in trade chat, and then run together all the way to the instance in order to get in and kill the bosses. The journey was such a huge part of the game back then and you made so many friends on the way. 
---
Blizzard sadly killed the community in WoW with all of these convenience changes, and I'm hoping (almost praying) that Classic will bring it back.
---
You must be a mage the way you conjured up that bullshit
---
Sorry bro. Top wow streamer
---
15+ years of experience.. running there game into the ground? Righhhhht.
---
just play shadow, and spec healing for raids like aq40 and naxx. BWL you can do most fights healing even with spriest talents.   
---
holy and disc mostly give you mana regen and or healing bonus. its enough to make a difference, but a good player should be able to hold their own.
---
Dear god the pure nostalgia....
---
I remember when the internet cafes used to be filled with WoW players. Now they're all LoL.
---
Yeah, obviously, because Blizzard were the ones who built that bridge and put up the toll gate, and their word can't be trusted because a completely separate independent party lied about something completely different.
---
How are you tweaking tho...
---
They wouldnt auto cast abilities sometimes. They would attack once and return to me. They would reposition a lot around certain mobs, like they had ADHD. There was a lot going on there, I reported everything I could find but I don't think its a super high prio for them right now

too late..
---
Don’t plan on aoe grinding for the first few months
---
Extra layers = Extra Worlds.. with less people hitting 60 the materials found in the open worlds value will be decreased.. because there is 3-4 times the availability and a normal amount of lvl 60’s to use them.
---
Stupid. Stupid. Stupidz
---
The irony is that the hunter has feign death and an ice trap that trumps sap. The Hunter would still be alive. He wud prolly rez everyone.
---
lol gravestone scepter does as much damage as mindblast yet its free, doesnt have hitstun, and goes off in 1.5 seconds.
---
Not confirmed, but EU is only getting "several" and if Germany (more than 20% of EU's active playerbase) isn't getting even one of their own servers, then there's no reason to suspect all of Europe is getting more than 5. And since EU has almost identical playerbase to NA, there's no reason to suspect the US is getting more than 3 servers per coast (1 for each type). Australia and South America will have to use the US Pacific servers.
---
The updated character models would look out of place, in my opinion.   
---
But I imagine it won't be difficult to replace them. It's never been difficult to my knowledge.
---
Dwarf mages lol. It was definitely made during the Beta for vanilla.
---
The first one is the best
---
One upvote is  sad. Here have another. (Ball is life)
---
No one treats me like this in Hello Kitty Island Adventure.
---
When you level through WoW, the first levels come very quick because the experience required is quite low relative to the experience required to level from 59 to 60.  
---
Evening out the distribution of experience so that it is the same for every level is called normalisation.
---
The normalised half way point to level 60 (60/2 = 30) is the point at which the game displays your level as 44.01.  
---
Quarter of the way to 60 (60/4 = 15) is the point at which the game displays your level as 31.6.
---
You are 75% of the way to 60 (0.75 * 60 = 45) when the game displays your level as 52.79.
---
Just before you are level 9, you have dinged 7 times, in terms of total xp acquired, you are only 2/60 of the way to level 60.
---
Maybe this will help, I added a column to the table showing the total progress to 60 as a percentage.

One should always  strive to use your abilities as good as possible of course. I didnt mean that there is anything wrong with it. 
---
It doesnt seem very fun or engaging to have a standard plan that makes the distance between yourself and the best healer increase further. Hence My comment about buying gear for other players instead of for yourself.
---
there has been no content past lvl 40 and everyone is already crying how easy it is...
---
maybe low lvl dungeons are supposed to be easy?
---
cry again if you dont wipe in ubrs, or cry if you do cause its to hard. someone will cry either way
---
Yup, that's why my route has westfall from 12-15, then I clear out all of loch modan, then I come back and do 17-18 in westfall
---
To all the people saying things won’t be fixed, look here please. They are working on this and trying to make it as close as they can. So sick of all the negativity in this sub.
---
LOL, thank you kind traveler
---
One more thing to consider, if you want to raid, consider debuffs. I think Warlock is a really fucking amazing class... In Dungeons, Open World, and PvP, but in Raids, it plays like shit and I'd rather put a gun to my head than raid to KT on a destro lock pressing shadow bolt until the 2.5s cast timer is forever burned into my fucking skull. Same with Mage. 
---
Fury Warrior, Ret Paladin, and Feral Druid are the only classes with real gameplay in raid if you're looking at it from a modern perspective, and two of them are memespecs. There are a lot of specs that would be very complex if the debuff limit didn't exist. 
---
inb4: "lolret you just auto attack lul", nah it's a proc reactive spec. Vengeance reactivity, timing spells, ranks, consumes, etc within that window, downranking Conse to save mana out of venge, is pretty big. Its not rocket science, but there's minmax there if you want it. 
---
I've been testing spell rotations on instant 60 undocumented servers to see how they work, get a feel for the mana consumption and interactions. I'd recommend it.
---
&gt;Lunch
---
Launch
---
&gt; The rationale is that Blizzard is assuming off of available data via surveying and publicly available data that servers for specific languages will probably die out.
---
No the rationale is once again that Blizzard have no fucking clue what they're doing. Want to prevent servers from dying out? OFFER FREE SERVER TRANSFERS for low pop servers! Want to turn off layering? OFFER FREE FUCKING SERVER TRANSFERS for low pop servers. It has been done in the past and suggested probably over a thousand times in this sub alone.
---
&gt; I figure the cost benefit analysis ran in support for multiple languages probably wasn't as high as they'd like it to be.
---
They already have language specific support for retail, there is no additional cost there. There are even language specific official CLASSIC forums. Why would you have language specific classic forums, with language specific moderators, when you don't even have language specific realms for classic? Even a 5 year old who can count 1 and 1 together would come to the conclusion that something doesn't add up here.
---
I'm not sure if that comment's supposed to be targeted at me because I just asked a simple question.
---
Why is the hunter dead?  He's gonna be the first one to feign and laugh at everyone else.
---
Source:  career hunter
---
Rank 10 on my druid and if I'm feeling crazy exalted with all the pvp factions. I dont know if the conqueror title will be in the game but that would be pretty cool
---
lol, who are you trying to convince?  Me or yourself.
---
Are you daggers or swords? Are you opening on a warrior or a mage? Is it an orc or a human? The answer varies.
---
The difference between NA and EU is actually quite bigger than that
---
4.3 millions lvl 120 characters on EU, 3.65 millions NA
---
Strangely enough, I didn't have a bug reporter during the stress test. Though that's probably because it uses the "live" client instead of the "beta" client.
---
Agreed, melee leeway range, spell batching and layering all need tweaks before launch imo.
---
Ye i raided naxx in wotlk only and it was fun... my first ever kill videos are from there.
---
I did manage to sneak in one old naxx run at 70 and managed to get a couple items from there which are now unobtainable. :P
---
Unfortunately not very many... its harsh rolling against 39 other players!
---
But you can mouseover kick or blind now.
---
I don’t think leveling experience is that important. If you duo you’ll be fine either way, Priest can drink while Warrior kills.
---
Endgame? Warrior / Priest is the “I can do anything I want right now” combo.
---
How to cancel attack my dude ?
---
This isn't supposition.  This is what I have seen in chat and what I have experienced myself on a mage, a druid, and a priest.
---
Go clutch your pearls somewhere else; the internet is no place for a churchlady.
---
Yes, but the active playerbase isn't.
---
~401,389 characters seen in the last 30 days on all EU realms (excluding Russia).
---
~472,189 characters seen in the last 30 days on all NA realms (including South America and Oceania).
---
http://www.warcraftrealms.com
---
I’m picturing you pushing back your glasses with one hand as you say this. You sound hilarious lol
---
&gt; Let's see what Blizz comes up with for Oceania.
---
To *really* replicate the Oceanic Classic WoW experience, I bet Blizzard tells us there are no Oceanic servers, and maintenance is in our prime time on Tuesday nights.
---
No!! Id rather not play the game than occasionally have someone disappear in front of me for a brief period of time!!!!!! REEEEEE
---
I found this on 4chan /vg/. This as well [https://imgur.com/a/wrzZN21](https://imgur.com/a/wrzZN21)
---
It's a bit slower before your talents starting working for you yes, particularly in the levels before a new frostbolt rank. I wouldn't really ever call it hard though, you're never really in ever danger of dying as a mage and can solo nearly every quest - just be patient.
---
As a melee player I agree, it’s going to lower the skill cap and totally skew all the meta way more to melee, we need to keep bringing this up on here and in forums, so it doesn’t get out to launch. 
---
Leeway and spell batching desperately need to be tweaked before launch.
---
I guess the “casualization” of Blizzard prevails again.
---
I have no idea why duels are interesting to people. There's a reason they didn't include a 1v1 arena in TBC.
---
Probably. The closer we get to release the less people are going to play it. Don't expect people to play 12+ hours a day like they did when leveling.
---
Why is that
---
Okay but what are you trying to show us?
---
So, as you all know, I play a Shaman. I'm currently the best geared Shaman in the world ([http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Aerie+Peak&amp;n=Darkness](http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Aerie+Peak&amp;n=Darkness)) and I have multiple world DPS records on WowMeterOnline. So I go into this Battleground because I feel like gracing my battlegroup with my presence, right? Everyone is cheering as I enter. They don't bother putting down a mage table or healthstone because they know that they're not going to need it--I, the Darkness, has come.
---
So I cast Lightning Shield on myself, because that's what Shamans do. They call down MOTES OF ELECTRICITY FROM THE HEAVENS and they SURROUND THEMSELVES with DEADLY AMOUNTS OF LIGHTNING! All of my teammates are instantly electrocuted to death, but me? I merely bathe in the energy; it is my plaything. Even though my teammates are now charred corpses, they continue to cheer, because they know that I can solo this. The gates open. I run in. With Ghost Wolf, my movement speed is increased by

They can hear the howl of my ghost wolf. They are all cowering--no, literally, they type the /cower emote and just stand there--as I cap the Stables. I cast WATERWALKING on myself--WATERWALKING, like Jesus, and I careen towards the Blacksmith. The Horde there see me coming and they just /afk the !@#$ out. I put down my totems before I start capping Blacksmith's flag. A Rogue tries to sap me--
---
BAM!
---
The Rogue is engulfed in flame as my Searing Totem SEARS him from the inside out! His leather clothing EXPLODES in a rain of fire that spirals around my beautiful female Draenei form as I continue to cap the Blacksmith. The fire rips through the Rogue's bones, but it doesn't even consider touching me--why? Because I've got

A Warlock swoops in in Demon Form and tries to Conflag me but his Conflag does 0 damage to me because of

---
POTATOES. BOIL 'EM, MASH 'EM, STICK 'EM IN A STEW. AND HEARTS. SHAMAN DESIRES PALADIN HEARRRRRRRTS.
---
Just then, I see something through my Sentry Totem. It's the WoW General Forums! --People are complaining about how overpowered I am! They're saying that Shamans need to be nerfed. I smirk.
---
That's when I decide to take out my HAND OF RAGNAROS.
---
EIGHTY POINT FOUR DAMAGE PER SECONNNNND
---
I slam the Hand of Ragnaros down into the ground. Arathi Basin shatters like glass--the ground falls out from under me. The fabric of SPACE itself CRUMBLES beneath my feet. I cackle as I enter the REAL REALM, becoming a TRUE ENTITY existing ON THE PLANET EARTH. I am a Draenei walking around New York--the cops try to stop me, but they forget all about me when they take a gander at my

STONECLAW TOTEM

STONE AND CLAW COMBINED. CAN YOU TAKE IT?
---
But then, in the spaces between the gathering crowds, I see something. Someone. The smirk on my face deteriorates. .. it's one of the Horde. A Troll.
---
I thought I had destroyed Arathi Basin. I thought I had won the Battleground. But all that time--
---
\--But all that time--...

.. there he was. Just standing there. Regenerating 5, health,

---
I glared at the Troll.
---
The Troll glared back at me.
---
Silence flooded the world.
---
"And there's nothing you can do about it," the Troll whispered.
---
So there I was....
---
You miss the point. Playing on english servers is not a Issue because.. well everyone can understand english at least or speak it on some form.
---
BUT EU servers this doesnt apply. Its a mmorpg you have to work together .. and you should be able to communicate.
---
I mean i left german server behind me too in mmos because of that reason. But mixing together ppl on one server that cant even talk to each other is stupid as fuck. 
---
Why this is stupid got explained many times now.
---
Shoey is definitely a thing.
---
no not you, its targeted to everyone saying its easy as if they have hard evidences for everything. just needed to vent after reading this sub for 2h straight.
---
sure, scarlet monestry we did with 2h cleave warries too while leveling. ubrs? not so much
---
Very nice. I feel like knowing the lore makes the game more enjoyable and engaging.
---
You could work it into a macro but it's quite easy if you get the positioning down. From the side you can still do abilities, but aren't in range for auto attacks. You could also quickly turn around, or cancel your target.
---
Hahaha.  Oh man.  Thanks for clearing that up.  I was so confused.  Thanks friend.
---
Thought it was interesting.
---
Will you link to the post? I’d love to show some support on it so it gets noticed quicker.
---
Ye as if it wasnt bad enough... now gear is being obsoleted within a patch cycle.
---
In BFA almost nobody does LFR because you can get better gear from warfronts.
---
Their reward structure is completely bonkered... more effort and time spent should give better rewards instead of the other way around.
---
Last time i tried to do LFR Ghuun i joined a run midway with 5 stacks of determination, equals to 5 wipes, so i though it must be easy this time but nah... we never got enough players to even try. People arent queueing.
---
After that day i tried again and 2 wipes on ghuun... not really worth it at all,  so i left, considering the gear is significantly worse than warfront and i dont even have to do anything important in warfronts. :(
---
i hope they fix it, but we all know blizzard
---
It can be disheartening knowing your work is going to be erased once Classic drops. I can see why people aren't playing the beta anymore.
---
I wonder if I can call dibs on posting it tomorrow. There might be a line, though.
---
Oh I was including Russia, but I don't think including south america is fair.
---
Not much to do at level cap other than screw around.
---
You can run them out of mana, and you can kill them if you CS them. Don't waste mana (CoC/FB/Blink), just bolt them down. You will be doing way more damage to them than they are to you, and they can only heal with instants. If they cast and you CS resto tree they're pretty much screwed (switch to fire spells if they go for a charge).  
---
You will probably lose in early gear if they are are swiftmend spec. If they aren't swiftmend you should be able to win or at least split games, and in high end gear your damage and efficiency goes way up you are favoured even against swiftmend specs.
---
I was a NE Rogue. As much as I miss it I’m going to roll UD Shadow Priest. I’ve never really played a caster (just rogue/dk/warrior) so I want to mix it up.
---
I'd ask why, but if I question one part of why Australia is this way I'd have to ask many more questions 😂 thanks!
---
I do agree with your statement to an extent. It's too early to make assumptions about dungeon difficulty as all the content haven't been tested yet. Just curious to see if the SM pattern will follow on to the higher levels though. It would definitely mean a lot.
---
Filling your shoe with alcohol kills the spiders and/or snakes that live in there.
---
Smite animation is also weird
---
The client has absolutely nothing to do with spell batching or pretty much anything else for that matter.
---
I leveled with only questing and exp from dungeons, no grinding, many times back in vanilla without any guides.
---
I have always wondered why people would bother to be a mod. It's voluntary and probably severely under appreciated backbone of reddit. Anyone know?
---
What both times I'm saying that it's not anything like original launch your fucking crazy
---
I personally asked for this and I'm glad it exists now. GOOD JOB
---
This is correct, I was posting on Classic forums without a sub.
---
Thought this post was gonna be you complaining about classic taking players away from BFA. Good to know you see the light.
---
Of course they have. Why would you stick around?
---
I don't think he/she did.
---
spell batching as fine as long as it works properly
---
in classic because of newer client they had to make it from ground up and obviously it doesnt work the way its supposed to work.. aka only working on some spells and not on everything
---
They can definitely go after servers in Western Europe. Russia not so much but who wants to play with a ping like that?
---
Yeah I’ll pass on pservers was just on the new one that launched today and the things that are off just in the starter zone are laughable.
---
I knew they were off when I played before but going from the test to a pserver I guess just made them stand out so much more.
---
How about layering only apply where it needs to: early starting zones and characters. This shit needs to go away. Why is it continent wide? Why is Blizzard even suggesting it may continue on into phase 2?
---
That's basically how it worked. On private servers, the public channels were supposed to be English only. Worked more or less in the grand scheme of things. Obviously, it didn't hold back some people from still posting in their mother tongue. In the end, it's many secluded communities that don't really interact with each other. That's why many people were really hoping for a Blizz release and a solution to the Babylonic conditions on private servers.
---
I'm sold!
---
I dunno man, shadow focus is pretty fucking nice.
---
&gt; Tone deaf in this case was more a metaphor for just being out of touch with the community. But also because it seems they don't give a fuck about europe. From what I know there haven't been any european stress tests.
---
Ah gotcha
---
&gt;Language realms will happen and if Blizzard don't support them officially, they will just be enforced by the community.
---
Yea this is quite obvious. And it'll hurt the poor sods who end up on a server that then morphs into a server of a language they don't speak...
---
Anyways, we'll have to wait and see what happens. Thanks for the respectful discussion mate.
---
i just hope it stops people jumping into thread with, 
---
“blizzard has the correct numbers and you dont”
---
when obviously dumping the old data into the new client can cause stuff to not be as it was on the old client.
---
I don't know, they listened about the spell batching thing and that seemed much more insignificant than this. I'm cautiously optimistic.
---
You're full of shit lol. There's world pvp everywhere in every server launch. Horde and alliance fight all the time for quest mobs and just randomly. Have you ever been in any private server at a launch and lvling in STV?
---
I need an adult
---
p accurate to what the actual servers will be like. a big burst of enthusiasm followed by a big drop off as only the loyal remain
---
I will gladly go to battle with friends like these.
---
If it gets released. If
---
I understand. IMO you need to focus less on numbers/meters and more on working together. I think innervating someone is not even compare to "buying gear for the priest". 
---
Also, the priest is *the number one healer* is comparison to a druid and is much more important. Druid will never touch the priest or hpally healing numbers even with a 100 innervates. The priest is what's keeping the tank alive. If he's oom, tanks probably gonna die and then raid wipe. Innervate is *almost always* used on the priest. Druids aren't just spamming heals theyre also abolishing poison and other utilities.
---
Good argument
---
Yesterday I wouldn't have agreed with you because it seemed like nothing was being fixed.
---
It should serve as a reminder that even if they aren't communicating, they are aware of things, and maybe the sky isn't falling.
---
Rolling invites would have been a good idea imo. Every month people are cycled in and out. Would have kept hype/hope alive, brought in fresh testers who actually log in and kept people subbed for a chance to be cycled in. Seems like a no loss solution for Blizzard but maybe I'm missing something.
---
Is it particularly more useful to keep the same group of testers in, even when a decent chunk of them don't log in anymore?
---
SM/Ruin is perfectly fine for PvP and is raid viable when things are on farm without noticing much.
---
I stopped playing sometime after lunch king so this makes me wonder exactly how bad the current game is. I remember having a ton of fun with wow, just dropped off at some point when I was an early teen
---
this!
---
He enters the Blizzard at 00:09.191
---
He enters combat at 00:10.209, which is when the first tick fires. Blizzard ticks once a second so this is normal.
---
He takes damage and gets slowed at 00:10.494. Spell batches fire every 400ms so this is also normal.
---
Nothing to see here, unless you want to argue that the Blizzard effect was not spell-batched, in which case you'd better cough up some proof because virtually all damaging effects were batched.
---
Yeah It'll be tough
---
Whatever man. You just don't seem to understand what im even talking about
---
im not too sure about that honestly. there is a delay on the range indicator colors switching. that together with the fact that its likely not a high fps video you are referencing, the deadzone could end at 8 yards or 11 tbh.
---
Let's not forget this classic: [https://youtu.be/iz-RmSG2s1k](https://youtu.be/iz-RmSG2s1k)
---
I think the wand spec hype train is really most applicable on an established server where you can send your alt priest the best wands every 5-8 levels.  On a fresh launch, enchanting to craft wands is only going to carry you so far without investing too much time into it to really save you time leveling.
---
Actually axis would make more since being alliance: human supremacy and extinction of the lesser races. #GarithosWasRight
---
Not looking forward to having to use a gun with classic gun sounds, though. They were so ridiculously annoying.
---
I'll certainly be looking for an addon to replace them with the current ones. 
---
Absolutely on boat with you on this needing a fix, just saying that I personally really don't like the old ones. SO noisy. All day long.
---
rip dwarf mage. can't believe they didn't launch with those in the game.
---
Support stays the same. A blue already confirmed German customer support for Classic on EU servers. The reason is that they seem to think that designated German/French/etc. servers will not have enough players long-term.
---
Yeah we should just repost screenshots from that stupid SouthPark episode ad nauseum
---
How does one go about "properly" progressing their wands on a fresh server launch?  Wasting time leveling enchanting to make better wands?  Hope you save extra time leveling to make up for the time spent leveling a profession.
---
This is not sharding or layering, the world definitely was not seamless, a few places were notable for this style of invisible border.
---
Layering isn't a casualization issue though. Managing overcrowding on launch isn't a casual issue. If they did nothing there would be an unacceptable amount of people in the zones. I don't care that 10 people on this sub are fine with that and think it's fun to go somewhere and grind mobs for the 1st 15 levels. That's not how even Vanilla was meant to be played, which is why Blizz is making sure it doesn't happen.
---
The whole point of Vanilla is that it was a more casual, questing based MMO that had a broader appeal. It was designed to avoid or limit that grind that most people don't enjoy doing (even hardcore MMO players). That is one of the main reasons it became as popular as it did.
---
And regardless of all that, layering doesn't remove mob competition or make it so no one sees each other out in the world while leveling. That's still going to be a thing. Layering is to avoid mass overcrowding.
---
I read it on shitter so many times
---
My server had one of the top EQ guilds clearing MC a couple months before anyone else got in there.
---
Pff yes I enjoy this very much
---
Oh ok, that makes sense.
---
I never knew that they changed in in Legion, I am
---
out of touch with newer xpacs.
---
I leveled to lvl 19 as a warrior before I died.
---
I haven't played retail since MoP, but I am assuming they wont remove the ability to change gear in combat, in which case whatever gearset addons or macros exist can be used. I am fairly certain the modern APIs support this.
---
Maybe it’s just me, but I hated waiting for hours in queues in Vanilla more than any effect of layering that I experienced in the stress test. 
---
Also, it seems that most the people I have seen talking about empty zones have been talking about the Barrens. I did not have the same feeling on the Alliance side in Northshire, Elwynn Forest, and Westfall.
---
However, while leveling my second toon to 15, in Teldrassil and Darkshore Friday, it seemed less populated but, by then most people had reached 15 and quit. Although those zones always felt less populated in Vanilla because everyone would skip them to go to Elwynn Forest and Westfall so I’m not sure that it counts.
---
Mine is packed away still from the last time I moved. Man that game always took my group sooo long to play. Definitely got that part right haha.
---
It will also fuck up bigtime the economy, imagine an overaboundance of mats and consumes on the AH, then suddenly the remove layering and everyone is fighting for veins, herbs and prices skyrocket on the AH.
---
&gt;©
---
I think using common knowledge might solve a lot of those problems too, since a level 17 player is probably not looking for Dire Maul.
---
Sounds like the usual.
---
so what about people who cant speak a proper english? just gotta play retail i guess  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
asmon-gol
---
That just means you can get a bunch of level 19's to go farm the arena chests or other world items, since higher levels wouldn't appear on any layers from your suggestion. I recommend limiting layering to specific starting areas, but just for 1-2 weeks after release, then remove the entire layering system from the game.
---
I would wait 24 hours for a queue if it meant no layering at all.
---
We know Russia is getting their own realms, so they shouldn't be counted in EU figures.
---
There are only ~38,058 active players on South American realms (which are all hosted in Los Angeles).
---
Even if you remove Oceania too (~36,626), that leaves North America with ~397,505, a difference of ~3,884 active players, which is a margin of less than 1% compared with EU.
---
There are however 3 census data points missing for NA:
---
* Alliance Tichondrius (6,559 Horde)
---
* Horde Alexstrasza (462 Alliance)
---
* Horde Terokkar (203 Alliance)
---
And missing 11 missing for EU:
---
* Alliance Doomhammer (425 Horde)
---
* Alliance &amp; Horde Molten Core
---
* Alliance &amp; Horde Shadowmoon
---
* Alliance &amp; Horde Stonemaul
---
* Alliance Turalyon (225 Horde)
---
* Alliance Twisting Nether (6,478 Horde)
---
* Alliance &amp; Horde Warsong
---
That gives the dataset a 98.59% accuracy (missing 14 out of 994 points).
---
Point is, however many realms the EU gets, which we have every reason to suspect is equal to or less than 5, NA will be getting the same. The only thing that might give the NA one extra realm is the fact that they have to support Oceania and South America (and any UK Brexit players).
---
The original Orc model is much better imo.
---
imo that's literally why launches are fun.  If you don't want that experience then you can just wait a few days.
---
Yes, it's not the same as private servers, because this is actually working properly while private servers had a hack on top of a hack.
---
Whilst you are right they probably will play on oce servers, those countries are not in oceania
---
Part of the draw of classic wow is the struggle to achieve something, because when you achieve something (example a mount) that's permanent, if not very long-lasting.  
---
Why struggle to achieve anything if that achievement is going to be wiped within 2 months? if you don't take screenshots there's nothing to say you existed in beta at all.
---
Not much. Just gotta be faster to position yourself. Ive been leveling with aoe grinding as a mage with EU ping.
---
How it even was similar to vanilla? 2 to 4 difficulty modes in raids that made raids less epic, current expansion raids becoming irrelevant before new expac, LFG, 5 ppl content being a joke, deleting old raid just to use it instead of new one, vault of archavon that dropped tier sets (it's almost was like a test for future LFR), adding a fucking attempt limit in raids, making game balanced (that one is a joke).
---
I don't know about PvP and leveling haven't changed much, but end game PvE was a completely different game
---
Factually incorrect.
---
 I'll wait as long as it takes if it means no layering.  When it ruins my experience in game it wont matter that I didnt have to wait.
---
Lol, and here I am going to Heal so my gf whos never played can just go H.A.M and Ill keep her alive
---
Thanks champ!
---
Haha holy fuck what a spaz out
---
Probably not once you factor in the cost and impact of keeping servers running.
---
Assuming old cardstock PC game packaging, not the new plastic DVD boxes.
---
a couple things I noticed.
---
Resurrecting at a spirit healer caused significant XP loss.
---
Ritual of Summoning (lock) cost 2 soul shards.
---
This really applies to anyone with a skill.
---
I'm an electrician, the shit people ask for me to do, you'd think they expect me to make wireless electricity work across an entire building.  Do I look like fucking Nikola Tesla to you?
---
Yep, you can't possibly do /join German and play exclusively with your guild. Nah back to retail you go :D
---
What if I wanna go show off my high level armour to all the noobs? 
---
/brokenidea
---
its the same one. theres a tab in the sheet for the fixed ones now
---
It's only the unofficial language of the English parts of the internet (like reddit). There are a lot of other places around that a typical English speaker probably never will see for obvious reasons. Like even my own language (Swedish) has had a few big websites of our own and stuff, even though everyone can speak English. For French, Spanish, German, and so on there are also a lot of people who don't speak English, or at least do it very badly, so they sort of have their own little "sphere" of the internet.
---
I used to dislike dwarf untill i tried it, a rogue blinded me and i stoneformed that shit and fearwarded as a priest came to fear me to prevent me from healing my warrior. 
---
Dwarf is so damn stronk. 
---
Even the visual has grown greatly on me.  The epic beards and the heal animation is superb IMO.
---
Never ever likes human males for anything, mainly laugh when i see people talking about serious PVP meanwhile they are human.
---
True, but I think the advantage of being Soul Link far outweighs the advantage of being Sub specced, at least in organized PVP.
---
love this board game. Do you also have the expansions?
---
I think the only major problem with layering is how easy it is to change layers. There is no reason to change a player's layer unless they are both in a group with someone in another layer AND they are near that player.
---
This is not a bug, and these guys should feel bad...  Sorry.
---
What they have found is the White Attack Crit Cap.
---
White attacks are 1-roll system, and they have a priority of effect:  
---
Miss  
---
Parry  
---
Dodge  
---
Block  
---

---
Hit  
---
Crit

In both cases, the berserker stance is pushing them over white crit cap.

France isn't a "remote location" and it's where Nostalrius (remember, that server that notoriously got shut down a few years ago?) was hosted.
---
Roger, thanks :)
---
There won't be any EN Servers. They clearly said that they are not language labeled which in return means that they won't enforce English in public channels. It will be a clusterfuck of Babylonic Proportions when all French/German/Spanish and Italian Players will join the players that are currently on EN. Level 120 Characters on EN Realms make up around 51% in the EU. German 29%, French 13%, Spanish 4% and Italian 1%. So every server will have a population of around 49% of players that normally play on a non-EN realm.
---
too bad
---
I would bring it to school with me so I felt like I was still connected to the game.
---
If you wanna make Spriest work, I would suggest just going holy first and informing your GM of your goals. if you stick around should be able to get gear and lock yourself in
---
Move to missouir you can afford a brand new car payment and rent a 1 bd beautiful house for 1000 a month.
---
french baguette here , french ppl suck ass when it come sto english.
---
I mean , i consider myself decent ( can understand and express ok-ish with writing, some trouble to have a conversation tho) and i m on the top5% in my country probably, and if i make a list of ppl skilled enough to play on a EU serv from my guildies/IRL friends , 10% would make it.
---
As someone who was an Everquest player originally before moving to WoW, all this kind of talk cracks me up because Everquest players talked massive shit about WoW back in the day, for being super casual and easy compared to EQ. Funny how we're all talking about classic wow and difficulty. But it is actually true, kind of amazing how much they have changed the game over the years.
---
Porkthirst? Porkalstrike? Porkrend? Porkflurry?
---
Spriest will be good for PvP but not for pve. You’ll only be brought for shadow weaving otherwise your kinda useless. Hunter pet scaling sucks at 60, by the time Naxx comes out you are the lowest viable dps. Lock is fun in PvP but if you are a horde lock, your dps will suffer in pve due to the threat. Can’t speak for rogue much, I know 1.12 was not a good patch for them
---
Great tips thank you!
---
All hell will break loose.
---
What if you factor in the cost of CD roms? Does anyone even use those anymore
---
Which might still be more than live.
---
Hah, already happening
---
To clarify, I was asking for a friend.
---
Skip hunter it’s broken. Look at all the bugs not to mention leeway.
---

---
blizz probably ran the numbers and realized there just wont be a big enough playerbase for language only servers
---
Yeah the guys a tool. Cant stand it. He also looks like a horse. How anyone can sit there and look at his face while he plays WoW is beyond me.
---
4 countries have french as an official language, and correct me if im wrong but i think there is more than 1 country with german as an official language. so at leats those 2 seems kinda logical ? 
---
the only solution i see for the complaint of " huh why dont we get a server for our obscure dialect if germans have one" would be to set a minimum amount of population using the language as their primary .
---
Warlocks don’t have any escape abilities. So, if you get attacked it’s pretty much get killed or be killed. And usually people won’t attack unless they have the upper hand
---
Man early Cata was actually great. I played a Paladin and had to actually optimize my priority to do good DPS and had to pay attention and make decisions as Holy. 
---
Looking forward to Classic (even though I'm not gonna Pally...)
---
I'd hope theyd all be fixed by then but you're right
---
How dare you compare the celestial forces of chain heal to the minor mana regen of from your pathetic spring. All hail be to chain heal
---
Yeah true, just that might take a lot of time to build a shadow set, and to be honest I hate healing. Are Hunters sought after for Tranq usually?
---
I agree, but even when classic launches everything we do will all come to an end also, we should live in the moment!
---
So basically all my choices suck lol thank you
---
m’lady

I think he means, why do people care enough about cardboard boxes that they became collectibles.

Shaman in Dungeons in Vanilla/Classic is truly one of the best experiences I've ever had in any MMO
---
I noticed the one I described [elsewhere in this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c3t68n/hunter_issues_in_the_beta/ert9iua/) is not on that list.
---
 [https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Kenco%27s\_research\_on\_threat](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Kenco%27s_research_on_threat)  
---
these numbers are official, u can see thunderclaps threat generated below, these threat numbers wouldve
---
been taken with battle stance in mind too, meaning no defiance/defensive stance threat buff.
---
Paladin v shaman duels were always awesome; especially if both had hand of rag.
---
I will probably go ahead and roll a hunter anyway, there were a lot of bugs with them in Vanilla also and I still played one to 60. Then again I played a rogue and a warlock too, so if it becomes a problem I will just roll another toon and have fun.
---
I trust the actual developers because they likely want to do it right. I don't trust the people in upper management who likely made the final decision about layering.
---
What if I want to be a priest, Bobby B?
---
Yeah, tranq is needed early. However, hunter pets dont scale so the longer the game runs for hunters become one of the worst classes in the game
---
Where do you come up with this bullshit.
---
GODS WHAT A STUPID NAME!
---
It's a closed beta. The majority *can't play*.
---
Where the hell do you live
---
Viable dps for pve and PvP is tough in classic. Most of the classes were not tuned like they should have been. It sucks, I would love to play a warlock but to have to have a threat reducing trinket and to limit my dps annoys me. Basically stuck playing a mage in classic
---
It's not. The timings in the video are what you would expect for a "worst-case" scenario:
---
- T+00:09.191: He enters the Blizzard AoE
---
- T+00:10.209: He enters combat as the first Blizzard tick occurs. Blizzard ticks once a second so this is normal.
---
- T+00:10.494: He takes damage and gets slowed. Spell batches fire every 400ms so this is also normal.
---
Repeat the situation in the video enough times and the timings will average towards about 0.5-0.75 seconds of delay. If they don't, you can start suspecting that it might be a bug.
---
Alliance or Horde? PVP or PVE server?
---
/1 is like attention seekers screaming something they once heard someone say ironically and everyone laughed and now it's out of context but they keep spamming harder despite nobody paying them any mind
---
No I don't but it's already a bit big and takes a long time that I haven't felt a need for them yet
---
That is authentic vanilla spell batching. This is what you asked for. That is 400ms in the video, plus a 1 second Blizzard tick. Check the timestamps and stop being a fucking tool.
---
Idk thought it was funny.
---
RFC with a level 10 shaman. are you sure?
---
Blizzard laughing all the way to the bank.
---
Car loan I agree with. Home loan though? Houses are assets and increase in value as long as you just keep up with basic maintenance. I bought one for 135k November 2016, sold it November 2018 for 165k. Only thing I did was replace the water heater.
---
I don't like streaming as a thing at all anymore.  Nobody should have more money than someone who works their asses off everyday. These little kids who follow most just take their parents cards and donate to these people so they dont need real jobs. It really makes me frustrated.
---
Do you have a link to the settings they used?
---
feral tank doesn't need to farm it, it just gets better for some specific fights. is like farming elemental stones or whatever. everyone needs to farm something, doesn't matter if it's a dungeon or not. also, you are not really farming the dg, it's just one boss that has a entrance that leads right to it.
---
Was a Ret Pally in Vanilla.  
---
Will be a holy/prot hybrid this time around, basically trading holy shock for blessing of Sanc.  Will be able to tank low-tier stuff and heal everything else.  
---
I’ll be leveling holy, so able to aoe tank or heal any dungeon while leveling, so grouping will be easy.  Grinding will be slow, but I hope to supplement grinding exp with dungeon runs.
---
Spell batching didn't exist to compensate for poor connectivity. It existed because of technological limitations on the server.
---
&gt;layering won't be an issue because it's only in certain zones
---
literally 100% wrong
---
That comparison is meaningless, client location is not necessarily identical to server location. We know for a fact that deadzone kiting has been an effective tool of dealing with hunters up until it was removed
---
Depends on Friends, but more likely to go Horde. PvP server. I LOVE PvP, but I'd also like to raid since I didn't get to originally on my rogue
---
I think it's the opposite. In better gear, the Druid has more mana and can shift more often, which prevents the Mage from landing a Shatter. The Mage can't land a kill until the Druid is out of mana. You can run him out of mana when you're both in low gear, or if the Druid happens to be a PvE Feral wearing Rogue gear that doesn't have any intellect on it. 
---
But once the Druid has a decent mana pool, it's game over for the Mage. Grenade + shatter + improved CS will get Druidy boy low but fall short of a kill. Then he can just Nature's Swiftness and heal to full once the silence wears off.
---
Put in the extra effort to strengthen the relationships with the people who will do the same. Do it in meatspace. Even sitting on your phones with the TV on just existing in the same space together. Think of just getting together as a skill to practice or a muscle to strengthen. In my experience, once you start doing this others will follow. Everyone else is probably starved of meaningful interactions too.
---
I'm not saying to just suddenly delete social media. I lost my facebutt account because I won't give them an ID. I would have rather done it on my own terms and transitioned out of using it. But my life is better without it. It requires more work to connect with people, but that's kinda the point. It's worth it.
---
Oh ma that's like all osrs is now. Lol.
---
it does? lol. CoE, CoS, CoR, spam shadowbolt
---
done.
---
if you are doing anything else you are doing it wrong.
---
Fuck... Thanks for the heads up
---
Yea, took us maybe 6 hours and my gf and her mate killed kael'thuzad the turn before I got there Q_Q
---
Is the Warlock pet micro even complicated ? You can also get an ability to remove it and gain different boost. Must have in raid I believe.
---
Pro
---
Names in the top of the pic. Posts with the name gets auto deleted.
---
Yeah exactly, spot on. Fuck man.
---
Yes, more concerned about getting that ganking rogue off me before I'm sliced to pieces.
---
In raid you are typically going to be sacrificing your pet for a buff, or possibly keeping your imp out in order to boost the tank HP
---
You're getting hung up on semantics. If everyone is in the starting zones, the layering obviously only affects the starting zones. I'm aware that layering isn't zone specific. 
---
I'm saying they'll make many many more layers since everyone one is 1-3 zones. As people spread out a bit the layers will collapse.
---
We get it your smart tho.
---
Umm so I stopped at racism and assumed there would be no benefit in reading further. It just sounded like a very angry rant at that point. Sorry you aren’t happy. Hope you find something to lighten your burden somewhere.
---
Are you going pve or pvp server? I’m in a similar boat as you but I think I’ll stick to my rogue ways. Was a rogue in vanilla, as strong a noob as ever haha, but that feeling of having control in world pvp encounters in end game and leveling is so nice.
---
Down in the springs, 700 for half a duplex up on the ridge
---
I've been to Missouri twice, I'd rather not. No offense.
---
Depends on class and gear. Warlocks can easily handle two mobs at once. Characters that have the appropriate gear for their levels will not have any problems. The game is designed to not give you "good gear" for your level. You either have to buy it from the AH, or run dungeons to get decent items for your character. 
---
This is by design. Getting appropriate gear for your character and making your character "strong" through that gear would make the leveling process easier, and thus faster. 
---
&gt; Second, there are enough people around that finding early mobs seems to be fairly difficult; so much so that I end up zoning out of the starting area, and grouping up with 4 other players just to level up.
---
It depends on when you get into the game. At the launch of Classic, this will likely be what you ***have*** to do because it'll be busy. This is why Blizzard is doing the Layering system.
---
This is also why I highly recommend that players find a leveling partner to group with when they play. You'll have a ***great*** experience and the game will be more manageable. 
---
However, ***after*** launch and perhaps a couple of months after, the starting areas will be sparse of players. This will make certain quests more difficult to do, and running dungeons that are lower level more difficult. 
---
&gt; The danger of pulling more than one mob gives the world a real sense of adventure,
---
Dangerous up until a point. There's a couple of things you can do to get around this. 
---
- If you have CC, you can obviously CC mobs. This clearly makes it easier. 
---
- Having a leveling partner is again, ***highly*** recommended. They can help you manage bad pulls. 
---
- If you are not in an instance, pretty much every mob in the game has a "leash" to the area that they are in. So, for example, the Gnolls in Westfall are often 2-4 to a group at their camps. Not a problem! 
---
All you need to do is grab run and start running away (make sure you use a ranged attack). Hit this target as you retreat every so often. While the other adds will come with them usually, they turn around and reset after like...30ft or so. Then you are safe to kill the mob you pulled. Rinse repeat. 
---
&gt; forcing me to try to use every ability I have. 
---
Depends on the class but a lot of classes will be spamming one button as the best ability. So for example as a druid I would pull with moonfire then go bear form. Kill the target and pop out to heal once, repeat. 
---
Warlock can just dot and walk away lol. 
---
Warrior is going to primarily be spamming heroic strike and not much else. 
---
You get the idea. 
---
&gt; Green items are much more rare
---
By design. Quests often do not give you good loot or loot that you can even use. This is to keep you "not as strong" so content is "harder" to do, thus slowing you down. I highly recommend that everyone check the AH when the game comes out. 
---
The AH is going to be flooded with green items from people leveling. That is how it was when the beta launched. The items will be fairly reasonably priced and the huge supply of these greens will lower the cost. So it will be very much worth it, especially for wand able classes, to pick up items (like wands) when the game launches. 
---
&gt; Gold is much more difficult to come by, so spending it wisely or finding ways to make gold become much more impactful.
---
Again, by design. The less gold that you have, the less you can do in the game, and the slower you are leveling. You could easily have enough gold to buy your mount at level 40 if you didn't have to buy abilities. They make you buy abilities to pull gold out of the game. This, again, slows your ability to level up since you typically won't have a mount at level 40. 
---
&gt; Professions provide real beneficial advantages in gear, buffs, healing, and in making gold.
---
It...depends. Any profession that makes items for you will typically ***never*** be up to date for your level or gear requirements. It has pretty much never worked that way, sadly. 
---
Much like with gear, potions and things like that just don't typically stay up to date with your pace of leveling. Especially with the cost to maintain those items. You won't have money for it. 
---
In truth, First aid is really the only profession that is a must, that will level fairly well with you, and will help tremendously. 
---
As far as making gold, that remains to be seen. You might think that Gathering Professions will be what makes you money, but then so does everyone else when the game launches. You might find yourself trying to sell at a super low price because supply has outweighed demand. 
---
I can't comment on professions because I simply don't know what will happen. 
---
&gt; Weapon skills add more depth to the RPG elements of the game. 
---
Weapon skills add practically nothing to the game and are a pretty big hindrance on playing your character. It makes it so that getting a new weapon isn't always an upgrade. Depending on your class it makes "training" that weapon a pain in the ass and completely unfun. 
---
I got a nice 2h axe on my paladin in the beta. I had been using a 2h sword up until this point. It took me like, 30-45mins to level my axe up fighting boars and it was just a waste of time. I watched a TV show while I did it and I am luckier than most when it comes to this. I can heal and I have Seal of the Crusade, which increases my swing speed, which makes this dumb process faster. 
---
You don't want to typically design a game where part of the process is putting your character on auto attack and then watching a movie. 
---
&gt; Best of all, I met so many players grouping up for quests, questing and dungeons. I probably had more player interaction in one hour of classic than in more than two years of playing current WoW.
---
This can go both ways, and social interactions is what you make of it. 
---
The game is designed to force players to group because certain quests require it of you, but that will eventually be a problem when zones become less populated and the player population gravitates towards higher end content. 
---
That's why Blizzard stopped doing group quests while leveling. They just became impossible to do because not enough people would be in the zone. 
---
Likewise instance questing suffered the same issue, which is why you no longer have to spam trade or general to find a group and can just queue for a dungeon. Today I tried to get into a deadmines group as a druid who could do either role because I had all 5 quests. I asked around Westfall and no one responded. Went to Stormwind and no one responded. Went back and forth for about 10-15mins then just logged out. 
---
&gt; I don't remember anyone's name or class, and don't care to remember. It's not an experience I'm going to remember two days later.
---
I don't remember anyone's name when I ran the dungeons that I ran so far in Classic. I do remember that our group make up required that our players know information that was "outside" of the game. 
---
As in, needing to know when to downrank healing spells. Needing to know how to play your class that isn't as simple as just reading the spells. So on and so forth. 
---
Some of the classes in our group are "not as good" because that's how they are designed, consequently they can occasionally make the entire party suffer or have a bad time. The most frustrating part was specifically telling people what they could do to improve their character and them ***ignoring*** it entirely. 
---
"Hey Feral druid tank. You should cast regrowth on yourself when you go to pull a large pack. That will help you retain aggro and help with my healing!" 
---
This is super important because as you can imagine, most people will not be specced for healing and will be "off healing" with suboptimal gear. So the whole party has to do extra to make up for it. 
---
Our tank never really did this for me as the healer, which was frustrating. Especially when you consider that his mana regens while in bear form. So when he pops out of bear form after a pull, he would be at full mana ready to regrowth again at pull...
---
&gt; I soon find that pulling more than 3 of anything is probably going to spell disaster.
---
Depends on group comp and how you handle it. In the deadmines run we accidentally pulled some guys off of the scaffolding. Our druid tank thankfully regrowthed and then rejuv himself then went bear form, which probably saved us. 
---
I then proceeded to downrank my heals to keep him stable. No issues. 
---
To put it in perspective about how the game is different, often for the worst, our warlock soulstoned me, the druid. I was level 18 and I told him that soulstoning me was pointless since Druids ***do not*** get access to a resurrect. I only have access to battleres. I told him it would be better to soulstone our ret paladin because he could actually recover us from a wipe. Kind of dumb if you ask me. 
---
&gt; Classic WoW and current WoW honestly feel like two completely different games in two very different parallel worlds. 
---
They are two different games because Classic WoW is basically the rough draft of World of Warcraft. It has a lot of issues mechanically with the game design. That of course is appealing for some. 
---
Of course if you were only playing the stress test, you're seeing the game in a different light and in limited scope than what it actually is.
---
I recommend really doing a lot of research into what class you want to play in Classic before you make it. Managing your expectations will be important depending on what you want to do.
---
Your assuming 2.5k players on one layer in a starting zone wont have those issues?
---
Spell misses read as resist, so even though you have no spell resistance, your spell can still miss, and will be read as a “Resist”. The fact that paladins are a hybrid and cannot itemize spell hit is actually a large part of the reason they have difficulty DPSing in a raid while being able to insta-gib players in PvP, in addition to issues like it being non-optimal to allow them to take a debuff slot for Judgement of the Crusader. If Debuff cap was raised pr made unlimited ret paladins would become even lower priority due to affliction warlocks.
---
i stopped at lvl 13. l cant wait for classic but i didnt wanna pour myself into the most fun leveling when it was going to erased.
---
Same. Hunters are a minority class, so less representation compared to popular classes (warrior/rogue/mage). 
---
I feel as if huntards will be the red headed step child. Huntards are the meme class that now will even further the memes with all the bugs the class is currently facing. You won’t be able to overcome the memes and blame for wiping a group cause of these bugs. 
---
If we want to get it fixed we need to be more vocal.
---
i hope he is healthy.
---
I didn't make VC a thing. It just was.
---
WAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH
---
WAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
---
WAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
---
Probably gonna get downvoted for this one, but I wanted to try and soft-reset peoples PoV's on Layering so we can all get a clear outlook on why it isn't working atm, and how it should work.
---
PvP server for sure. PvP in general is more important to me, but for some reason as a kid I never got into raiding. I want to try that this time around, and I'd like to get a fresh new experience. But, you may be right. It seems impossible to get a good PvP/PvE balance...
---
Horde PVP usually has less Hunters and regular priests but more rogues, warlocks and Spriests.
---
Rogue, Spriest and Hunter can raid and PVP on the same spec. Warlock usually goes soulLink for PVP.
---
Hunter is a bit harder to gear out on horde because I am sure shamans will roll on the same gear. 
---
I would personally go shadow priest as it is very good all around spec and raid as a healer and only respec if you really need to.
---
I didn’t forget them, I was just adding to what the OP already mentioned as additional concerns for my choice making haha.
---
Man this video is amazing lmao! I love it!
---
disable the subreddit style
---
I just made this comment a few minutes ago. It’s basically going to be too busy
---
&gt;Anyone planning on aoe grinding a lot in the first few months should rethink that strategy.
---
&gt;You might find an empty tier 1 spot once in a while, but to actually beat normal leveling speed via questing you need solo access to the spot uninterrupted for an extended amount of time. There are a few spots that can sustain 2 people (Hillsbrad comes to mind), but they are rare.
---
&gt;I’ll hit a spot for a while if it’s empty, but as soon as someone starts to interfere it’s not worth it.
---
&gt;(This is all from the perspective that you care most about leveling speed)
---
Issue with leeway is that it’s a vanilla mechanic to compensate for lag, which with today’s technology is not needed. So they would have to change it against vanilla to make it better. So who knows what will actually happen. But leeway really just destroys the PvP so still viable in PvE. Which makes me really hope the pet issues are fixed at the very least.
---
I like the added puncture effect. I'm all for the classic experience, but this is, uh, a tad much. If the little added puncture effect legitimately bothers someone, then... just yikes. 
---
Also, you can easily change ingame sounds - I'm sure someone would make an addon that just replaces the sound effect with an empty sound file. Calm down, folks.
---
I had the same experience with my warlock VW getting rejected by targets and running back to me starting around lvl 14. While I reported it, I haven’t seen posts about that in this reddit. Maybe I just missed them, but judging from the description it sounds like a problem with all pets not just hunters.
---
What did you say about dwarves, you knife-eared bastard?  
---
Joking aside, it's fine. Most guilds, even the serious ones, just needed atleast 1 or 2 of the priests to be dwarves. As I recall, not everyone had to be . Just more work for the ones that did go dwarf.
---
Yes, it's been widely reported as a problem, but none of the moderators can reproduce the issue so they don't care. Their solution is to tell you to use Reddit Mobile or Reddit New, which frankly I think is bullshit selfishness.
---
Even disabling the CSS through preferences or RES doesn't completely solve the problem. Your browser is still loading them, it's just not rendering them.
---
Best thing I did was move out to NOVA. Take the plunge into the south my dude.
---
Stop throwing out these giant player numbers without any validation. They add nothing to the discussion.
---
Thanks for this. Will be using this insult. Got any other class insults?
---
WARcraft. Lets go baby
---
Threat is the difficult part. Any joker can spam shadowbolt but riding the lightning is what takes skill. 
---
Also snapshotting your dots and burns.
---
U can raid in shadow spec with healing gear?
---
You know, I wasn't *too* salty about the streamer privilege of getting into beta, but now after seeing just how *few* people there are on the beta servers, now I am a little more salty.  Seriously, if its that damn exclusive, a bunch of streamers ate up like half of the current slots, and the other half are just RNG for us plebs.  Seriously Blizzard, what the fuck?  You have a goddamn army of FREE game testers chomping at the bit to try the game out and who *will* point out every little issue for you to fix.  You know, the entire point of beta testing.
---
That doesn't completely solve the issue.
---
Yeah it is but how are they tweaking though?
---
Can we join?
