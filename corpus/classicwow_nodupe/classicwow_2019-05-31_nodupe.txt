Give them a health stone.

---
It's back up! Sort of! World server is down for me.
---
Which heal spell would that be? The fuck are you talking?
---
Same here dude this is amazing lol
---
You the fking homie
---
Stress servers back up, but world server down.
---
On your layer at least..
---
yea both were upsetting, he deserved a spot in a raid at the very least
---
Bro, I'm in the same boat. I've always liked every class and not sticking to one and the INFP graph looks like one of the most balanced out of all the personalities.
---
Same for me.
---
I hope not.
---
Is druid solo farm actually viable? Generally curious as I might have a druid alt
---
Can’t fix stupid.
---
People have more /played in beta than it takes to get to 60 and they are level capped.  
---
The 5, 10, 30 capped classic is superior to BFA...just think about that.
---
That's actually not what makes them unplayable. Most problems are Mana sustain for hybrid DPS and nature resistance. Those are core. Debuff limit for class balance doesn't work because warlocks, rogues and warriors have lots of dots

I think what others would say is that if you want to RP, you can wear whatever you like in town. If you want some cohesion to the world, an item should look like what it looks like no matter who is wearing it.

---
Servers back up and world server up as well! LOG IN!
---
what do you mean lol. any heal spell you want but generally a mid-high ranked HT, HL, GH would be best
---
No one is in?  Looks like the "restart" was to take server offline.
---
Apparently hes using some addon to auto accept ghost. Could maybe be related to him releasing too quickly
---
I’m seriously having so much fun just watching him haha I love it
---
The mace was tauren only
---
I'm one of those people that never reached 60, but it wasn't because I didn't love the game, it is solely because there was always that lingering thought that this isn't permanent, this can be shut down and my characters ripped away at any moment.
---
It was an exploit, plain and clear, you could get banned for doing this.  I really hope people aren't legitimately going to invoke #nochanges for these, they can ruin many a warsong.
---
https://imgur.com/a/s61A7xB
---
But it's not a good point. It's completely unneeded forced "relationships" (it's the same people you are in contact with anyway...). It's like making a game harder by deciding to only use 1 hand. Sure it's harder but in a stupid unneeded way.
---
Yeah i do feel a bit sheepish, i.e should i say goat-ish...i guess i did make her during TBC xD
---
This isn’t really a valid representation of the continuing player base though. All these people are just doped up on hype and nostalgia right now. Especially with classic being the trend right now. I think classic wow will succeed in the long run but it’s still too early to tell how many will stick around after a month or so.
---
and omfg, are the people in /trade annoying. Worse than the worst server on a bad night.
---
Female Orc right in the balls
---
Fuck I wish we could make this happen &gt;&lt; yal have fun!!!
---
I die once in Redridge. Twice in Westfall from high level enemies. These are all on purpose to skip to a graveyard to spirit rez as fast travel.
---
I die 10 or so more times. Each one is just as a suicide fast travel system.
---
Avoid dying? They're all on purpose.
---
There is a 0% chance, and literally everyone would be obviously mad.
---
Perhaps this is the time to catch up on all those single player games Ive been neglecting for years...  Will probably just play Overwatch, but I *should* give Bioshock Infinite, Doom, etc. another shot
---
As a horde you could sit in SM and 1 shot people with gnomish death ray. You didnt get flagged for pvp until you hit them since it was horde territory. So they die from the blast and can do nothing to stop you. You zone into SM and wait for pvp flag to drop. Walk out and kill the next poor ally trying to run a dungeon. Fun way to wait for your pug.
---
True, and I think they deserve it.
---
This kid is gonna have nothing on what I’m about to do to myself
---
Here is me showing interest~~ o/
---
I just want to main on rp-pvp blizzard let my classic dreams live.
---
Playing Diablo 3 just makes me want to play Path of Exile.
---
Wouldn't it be cool if shamans could toss a totem to someone and they could carry it as a buff?
---
Rise up, sons and daughters of the Horde! The Hoggers are at our gates!
---
those were the days
---
I'd love an addon that changes to people's name to reflect the color of their class, similar to how retail does it now. Maybe even a number of their level preceding or following their name. I'm definitely in the no changes category but I wouldn't mind an addon for that. I frequently shift-click people in chat simply to see what class and level they are.
---
Technically, the level 4 isnt riding it, a random npc is and they're in the sidecar.
---
Are their offspring Dwomes? Gwarfs? Haflings?
---
“Yeah sure mom invite the reporter over to fuck you after the session again. I’m gonna farm SM”
---
Not that I would try, but it would completely ruin so non-beta player's chances for server many firsts.
---
First to 60,
---
Engame dungeons
---
I mean... Phase one is months and the entirety of MC... It's the integeral development of the "community" we remember. Saying it's done by phase two is ok is a seriously questionable statement.
---
Everyone's been fighting the "no changes" battle since day one, and now we let in a system that is disturbingly different than the vanilla experience.
---
Flying mounts killed the "World" of Warcraft, and is why while TBC was a lot of good stuff, it's like the herald of doom to me personally.
---
The thing is creating a new server post release is going to open a whole can of worms you don’t want.
---
Yea 0 chance of that happening.
---
My top three as well probably.
---
I also heard that they get a free flying mount in Classic.
---
Necessary first few weeks
---
End by phase 1 (months)
---
Wat
---
Lmao litterly the people who made the game. The whole reason this sub exists. 
---
All of them? They admitted it and classic wow has all the tables and numbers correct to the original version of the game. If you seem so interested in it maybe you should pay attention to forums and posts rather than downvoting facts that hurt your feelings
---
Yeah the chat in general this week has been much worse than last week.
---
You will see full sets constantly in Org and IF within a few months of launch. Then those people will put on their crazy mismatched outfits to go do content.
---
If this was true, hypothetically speaking.. You think people whine about layering, just you fucking wait lol.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Thankfully, this is not true. Keeping characters in a closed beta is so rare that the chance is 0%.
---
Now, if it was an open beta, then it MIGHT be the case.
---
But yeah, not happening.
---
I have a setup like this, and just face my primary (left) monitor most of the time. Swivel chair.
---
Secondary monitor I just look at every now and then.
---
Never gotten a sore neck from it.
---
For one, that leak isn't verified at all and the source for it no longer exists. Also, even that original source didn't include Chinese accounts. 
---
More importantly, active subscribers is not that same as people who enjoy retail. You don't need to be subbed all the time to enjoy the game. I've played every WoW expansion, and even when I was younger and super into it playing 12 hours a day, I still took breaks for months here and there. 
---
Myself and most of my friends/guildmates nowadays play cyclically. I had fun coming back and doing some raiding and PvP in BFA, though it is definitely not a good expansion, but after several months, I wanted to go play different games. Same as it was for Legion, and Wod, MoP, Cata etc... A lot of people are the same way.
---
Layering seriously makes me sad.
---
Merges. I'd much rather be transfered than to be on a retail esque server with phasing. You call it layering if you want but until I stop seeing people phase into different areas I'm not going to care about your opinion.
---
If you are beyond MC/bwl... you need imp scorch and ignite for mages
---
I hope Visionary Realms can turn Pantheon into a successful MMO. I watch a lot of Everquest streams and I've often thought about giving it a go, but the game just shows its age a bit too much.
---
I really hope Pantheon manages to update the EQ formula to modern standards because I'd love to get my hands on a game like that.
---
You are better of just drinking as soon as he pulls rather than waiting for him to reach the boss, then take damage, then heal, then drink.
---
I hated sunwell dailies. I love farming shit in Vanilla. It just seems so much nicer doing your own thing and getting a reasonable reward for it vs doing the same shit as every other person on the server and getting a better reward. Especially when you have to kill the same mobs, fight for the same pick ups and other stupid shit like that.
---
What I do enjoy is 1x daily dungeon which would give something to promote dungeon running. If they said today you get 1g bonus for killing Baron, then there will be waves of groups trying to run Strat. Tomorrow you get 2g extra for killing Drak. Boom UBRS groups etc.
---
And I wouldn't mind heroic modes of the lower dungeons which could fill some gear gaps even if it does change the game somewhat. Give more capes, rings, some oomkin / elesham / ret pally items to bring them slightly closer to relevancy.
---
It does mean something. The public at large as 0 interest at all in retail. Classic is one of the best marketed games in history.  Regardless of how a product in if everyone knows what it is and believes everyone else is excited for it people will purchase it just based on that alone
---
51/49 in ally favor
---
lol, none of that is gonna help.   There's no safe spaces in 2004 baby.
---
Turns out you were the mats all along.
---
So good lol
---
Isn’t it, though?
---
The math is 65%.
---
As a rogue main I always felt really grateful and kind of sad I didn’t have a buff to provide. But if looted a scroll I could finally feel like a boss!
---
I love being right. Everyone's been circle jerking this "amazing invention" and it wreaked of pseudo phasing from day one.
---
&gt;People have more /played in beta than it takes to get to 60
---
Everyone? Because it seems to me like you're thinking that because some people are nerding the hell out over classic (understandably) everyone will. 
---
There are people in BfA who have been regularly playing since classic without ever dropping their sub. It's not a representation of the average BfA player, though.
---
I'm sure classic will have a sizeable amount of players, but implying that all of the people logging into the stress test will be long term players seems utterly detached from reality.
---
Is it POSSIBLE? Yes. But you're insane if you think you can tell for sure with what we know now. Many of these people have never played classic before and thusly no idea if they will like it at all. How can you know before they do? How can you not see how insane it is to state that you do know?
---
Nice! That’s the old art for dragonstalker?
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10IV_3NEmZdhh8iQXrs2Ek77YyUJbjBMWO5UxIWLlZl0/htmlview?usp=sharing&amp;sle=true#
---
It's a phenomenal spreadsheet. I wish I could link the creator.
---
Oh hey its the creeper gamergate guy who also fucking destroyed Firefall.
---
Randomly buffing and healing people was part of the fun.  It was always fun to  run into someone getting ganked, and then heal them back up and watch the ganker either run off or die.
---
&gt; How the fuck does that function for a Naga?
---
One leg inside the other, worn as a tube.
---
No this is dumb. No changes!
---
Uhhh we need Ogres.
---
Well it really depends on the situation. There are plenty of times when chain pulling dungeon packs where the tank will need a heal sooner rather than later (he's at 60% hp or so with 3 mobs on him) and you're at lowish mana from the previous pack. This lets you max rank heal him up to full health and drink for quite a while before he's in danger again. It's not some god tier thing or anything but it will be insanely relevant if classic goes to TBC due to its applications in arena. It pretty much bumps paladins and shamans up an entire tier in arena by itself.
---
I think what you’d find is that most guilds that got stuck in raiding hell weren’t as “top-heavy” as those progression guilds. Having the right people as officers and with key raid responsibilities is way more important than having mid-level skill in all 40 spots.
---
I remember some of those guilds. Often times you’d see people with poor itemization, non-optimal specs, unenchanted gear, etc. half-assing their way through raids. 
---
Don’t forget that raids until Naxx weren’t balanced around people using consumables, so 25 people fully potted and flasked up are going to outscale the 40-man no-pot raid tuning.
---
My OG Vanilla guild made it halfway through  Naxx with ~15 revolving door raidspots. They brought people to Naxx who were still in blues/greens, but got stuck at Patchwerk/Heigan because of those hard checks. But we still cleared BWL/AQ40 in decent time.
---
&gt;	In fact the top guilds on my server back in vanilla actually raided fewer hours than many guilds who never got farther than the first few bosses in BWL. 
---
That’s called “farm status”. Progression for us was 6 days a week, ~5 hours a day. On farm status you can knock out MC/BWL/AQ in one night.
---
Why are other people so insistent about telling strangers what to do? What made you this fucking lame?
---
Reason number 234 to roll gnome
---
Private servers have *never* had access to serverside data. It was all reverse engineered, and to this day much of it is still wrong. Gnome scaling being one of them.
---
Sitting in server ques and server crashes isn’t the vanilla experience I want to recreate.
---
Multiple raid difficulties killed any sense of progression. In BC when you cleared kara you got to do ssc and the eye. When you beat those you got to visit hyjal and black temple, then onto the sunwell. Starting in wrath they said oh hey you beat it, now go do the exact same thing just slightly harder. It wasn't the worst in wrath, but it's where the downfall started.
---
 And the first 9 months of wrath were dogshit. There were 3 new bosses, malygos sarth and the voa guy, and a reused zone. And all of it was mind numbingly easy so it got boring real fast.
---
I made a post about us doing this, but it got removed because they accidentally spelt “Omab”. Thanks classic wow mods...
---
wow cool.  I farmed obsessively as a 70 twink during wotlk/cata and I got those beads as well.  I remember that grind.  SO MANY OGRES.  I almost got exalted with every faction in TBC as a twink just from obsessive farming it was fun stuff
---
Foreal man. I ran this thing twice in all of vanilla and never touched it again till LFG random picked it in wrath. I’m gonna avoid it like the plague in classic!
---
3 druids horde side? why?
---
When i first got WoW I went through the Brady Games strategy guide and found every level 40 mail item with the highest armor value for the slot and said "I will have this when I hit 40 on my shaman"... The shammy never made it past 28, my priest did hit 60 in a reasonable timeframe though.
---
Bolvar Hogger in place of Sylvanas.
---
I appreciate the level headed response. It's a see of downvotes in here but you've got my upvote at least
---
I havent played since burning crusade and a little of lich king but the bow and staff were a hunter only series of quests and some of the stuff wasnt east to get in the big 40 man raids. If you seen hunters with those you knew they were legit.

Just look at Runescape3 vs OSRS. 
---
Against all expectations, the original grindier, autismo version of the game is more popular than the modern accessible updated game.
---
yikes, this couldn't possibly be any more dumb
---
ENFP rolling Priest, Cool to see how different personalities have different preferred classes.
---
This made me smile
---
Is this the beta or stress test?
---
A giant server event is going on and you're boo-hooing about people flooding trade chat? Come the fuck on.
---
Sorry. I was taking about the shoulders of 2 of the night elfs down the way. I’m pretty sure it’s the original artwork for dragonstalker epaulets.

---
Epic screenshot
---
There are no dumb questions.
---
Except this one. Sorry.
---
What am I missing here? When the tank pulls you have 0.5 seconds before you are put in combat. I haven´t played in a long time but that should be how it works.
---
No, they don’t get to keep their characters.
---
On some more recent private servers, some guilds clear MC 10 days after launch. This is including leveling their characters from 1. There’s definitely going to be some guilds aiming for that prestige in Classic.
---
Since content will be released in stages, and we are all fully aware of what’s coming, content will be cleared day 1 of its release by the more serious guilds. Within hours.
---
The only hold up MIGHT be 4HM, since the warrior tier set is so highly valued. But it’s not a requirement, it just helps prevent issues. So I fully expect Naxx to be cleared extremely quickly as well.
---
I remember being a warlock trying to be helpful and apply buffs so i did the water breathing one at the start of every dung lol
---
&gt;I love classic but deducing from everyone wanting to check it out that it is gonna be long term successful is just fucking illogical.
---
MFW people who work shitty low tier jobs believe that they can accurately judge an international reception for a product that's never been done before. You think other people are illogical but your not even qualified to have an opinion yet you push it out anyways.  
---
Whats your job again fam?
---
I think what you'll find is that your style of play - the idea that the majority of players should be gimped to support your personal preferences - is by far in the minority.
---
This is why I was hoping blizzard would leave them in there for the sake of less account sharing which was an actual reason for doing guild banks... Sigh, still not my problem, now my officers problems
---
Gee I haven't seen this post on here before
---
I dont think those were.. hard to tell from the screenshot. We all had pretty craptastic gear aside from the bows and staves.
---
Coulda been tho.. i remember they were a dragon head.. i cant really make that out.
---
!remind me 3 months
---
Now do Hyjal, if you can still glitch through the gate as a ghost!
---
I use it to die faster. So it’s not pointless.
---
You bet you were.
---
This is the best meme this sub has ever made
---
omar common spawn yourself in some nice stuff or at least the gm gear and weapons
---
Sounds like plan! I'm excited as well, haven't played in ~9 years (pre-Cataclysm). I just so happened to stumble upon this WoW Classic news today lol. Now just trying to get my ducks in a row for this wild adventure, I'm hyped.  It can't be too early to find a guild, eh?
---
Dude, it worked (not sure if it still does). Casting fort broke the mind control, but the cast got off.
---
not how it works. Raid bosses and some raid trash packs have global combat, but almost nothing in dungeons does.
---
Or get a good mix, to entice people *back* to what they once knew or to something they never experienced. Hurdy dur.
---
I will be dreaming about Ogres for weeks I’ll tell you that
---
Someone buffed me I must hunt them down and buff them then run away before they can buff me back there by making me the winner in the buff war mwhahahahhahahaha
---
I don't think it was ever much of a thing. A very recent invention by private servers if anything.
---
spamming idiots are annoying no matter what is going on.
---
Who is omar?
---
I’m so excited for the elite orc quests in red ridge. That whole chain is neutered and uninteresting now but I remember back in the day that it was hard af.
---
Yo! I was Tyranas, the nelf druid flag carrier against you guys that last WSG. How did you have a level 15? Also your guys' whole team was tricked out like mad. Nice gear
---
Wish the in game cinematics had this much crowds
---
NEED MORE AT THRALL!!!!!
---
Yep according to the inflation rate of the us 15.00 in 2004 is the equivalent of 20.29 in 2019 dollars....
---
the beta is here to find bugs. chance making it widely known will only increase the chance that it gets fixed.
---
It is, not everybody has access.
---
paladin is nice for when you're there and doing your thing already, 5 min buff is rather short. druid is nice for the longevity
---
Beta progress has never carried over to any game ever. Why do people keep making these posts?
---
Worked for runescape!
---
Not quite. There are aspects of MMOs that are different from open-world singleplayers, even when grouping is not forced. You can also have content that’s tuned for various group sizes, down to solo play. Dungeons should require a party, just like raids should require massive numbers of players. But if I want to go out mining, or clearing out a kobold camp, I should be able to reasonably do that by myself. Even traveling cross-country should be possible without getting a full caravan together, provided you play cautiously.
---
I didn't even notice we had a 15 but apparently it happened several times that people from the beta got in our bg queues. We weren't a premade at all so it was just chance that we were all decked out I guess :p
---
what are you even babbling about
---
it doesn't matter if he cleans toilets or if hes an MIT statistician, he's no more or less qualified to make random posts on reddit than anyone else
---
I still say I’m level 30 not 30 years old sometimes.
---
This was my first ever dungeon.  Took 2 hours to get a group together.  It still brings back good memories every time I run it even now.  I carried the mallet for a long time that you got when you completed the quest line afterwards.  That toon may still have it in the bank.
---
trolls clearly doing capoeira, much like his dance

Moore Law is very outdated, computers improved much more in the 80/90s than in the 2010s, it is kind of stagnant right now

Plenty of streamers are horde?
---
Why? Ally players are in non-PvP zones...
---
Have you ever considered going hord? Levelling as a warrior whit a shaman friend is awesome.
---
We didn't last time... #nochanges
---
Please just stop. A ton of level 1-5s following a streamer does not mean there will be long term success. Will be classic be successful, maybe. But the constant "you think you do" post are idiotic.

Only if you want to call collaborating with Orcs who were coerced and possessed by demon blood filthy.

Yeah you get to keep them. Why do you think streamers get in?
---
I completely agree, but it's ironic that it sounds a lot like - we want our players to have a sense of pride and accomplishment :D
---
Nothing feels better than raiding getting great gear and then being a god in pvp
---
Yes. Easily doable.
---
There are multiple hoggers at the exit of deathknell killing anyone who goes trough.
---
Will not do much sins you can't parry if you are hitt from behind

I-it's my turn on the xBox :'\[
---
I thought WotlK was good, but it was the start of the decline, stopped playing during Cata, picked it up again for BfA, quit BFA in about a month. 
---
In my personal opinion there are far more activities to do in current WoW but none of them feel rewarding in anyway, from early leveling to end game. 
---
Easy to obtain epic gear has led to the decline in WoW
---
What is dodge chance? 5%?
---
What is dodge chance on a 5 point eviscerate? 80%?
---
On a full rage bar in execute range. 95%
---
Arena in BC, wrath and maybe a few other expansions were better than vanilla PvP.
---
9% harder
---
except tanks hit from the front.
---
Tanks generally tank facing the front........
---
Remember Enti's Quenched Sword?
---
The tank will face it!
---
What a LITERAL GOD.
---
&lt;3 Omar
---
Hopefully more beta invites!!!
---
Personally:
---
~ No new raid content at that start, and very easy too (at start)
---
~ Vehicle combat (I like to use my class in a RPG)
---
~ LFD, Phasing (now a solo game)
---
And other nitpicks, like missing zones (was excited for the underground zone), and felt the achievement system with multi-difficult raids were just an excuse to squeeze content out of easy bosses (instead of focus on the main event). Basically it didn't feel like a MMORPG anymore, no more community, etc.
---
So.....good luck tanking on any race without +weaponskill.
---
thats my guess as well not like I'd actually roll a hunter just to test it but I think its one of those edgecase bugs that was not very well known at the time

---
As a priest I throw out PW: Fortitude to everyone without thinking too much about it, but it seems that a lot of people really appreciate it and often buff me back or thanks me which is a really nice feeling. Today I got 3 pots of defense from some random Orc that I buffed. Helped me for 3 hours in total as I leveled, just because I pressed a button to buff another player. Great stuff and good value.
---
This phony concern trolling is so darn lame and getting old at this point. I really wish the mods would just ban you people.
---
Oh but that does mean something, though fortunately that’s not the case with me. The more you talk the less i doubt you’re what you claim you are lol. Who said anything about owning stock anyway? you’re remarks are getting more and more dumb. 
---
I’m not going to argue with a stranger about what i own and manage though. what you originally said was an extremely stupid and ignorant claim.
---
This is just plain evil...
---
The stress test is invite only and requires an active subscription, right? Classic will be just as free as the stress test, requiring only a subscription.
---
it'll make every encounter rather dramatically more difficult than on private servers. It's a major nerf to threat generation, healer sustain and a buff to boss white damage through parry hasting. The figure is large enough that the difference should be very considerable.
---
Fury tanking was possibly during vanilla, but only on trivial content. In effect, private servers have been raiding trivial content since day 1.
---
That is not how combat works in vanilla at all.
---
Shadow word pain, shadow weaving and mind flay if you are bringing a shadow prist
---
you really shoudlnt be using curse of weakness ever and def not curse of shadows if its only 8
---
humans will surely shine in this situation.
---
Best one yet
---
So that you can avoid the streamers fan base constantly aiding a particular guild and faction and making the game relatively unplayable for other people who are in the same area or doing the same things. Not sure why people downvote instead of explaining.
---
Without it you will have the absolute worst launch experience you can imagine. It’s only for a few weeks and that’s fine by me.
---
I remember dropping the flag outside of the map to keep it away from a wall jumper  and then shutting down the server :/
---
Same thing in Shadowglen
---
You really do need to calm down, though.
---
Ah, I found a way around them.
---
The majority of classic world pvp was centered around blackrock and good farm spots. The same was true in BC.
---
 In front of ssc (where you couldnt fly at all btw) was a good place to pick a fight, outside gruuls lair, halaa, elemental plateau, hellfire and zangar towers, in front of black temple, netherdrake island, ogrila, the setthik place in terrokar, in front of kara.
---
World pvp was alive and well in BC.
---
Not quite, because parries reduce the auto attack timer of the victim by 50%. So it they parry more than intended then it'll mean a fair bit more tank damage as well.
---
Highlord Bolvar attacked the horde capitals and Thrall attacked the alliance capitals (though in the form of Hogger)
---
Does 2h fury go for faster weaps though- like the 2.8-3.5 speeds?  Seems viable to me to have quicker attacks since bloodthirst doesn't scale off of weapon speed at all, and otherwise the only proc you have that maters based on weap speed is ww and overpower.   With the faster weap you get rage more consistently, and you could even spec into the 2nd tier fury talent and get more mileage from that (40% chance to get extra rage pt on attack)
---
I wasn't sure if I had my nostalgia goggles or if I really wanted vanilla again. I haven't played since WotLK. So I fired up WoW (you can play it without a subscription now to level 20). I started a druid character. Got to level 15 or so very quickly. Didn't die once. Was honestly feeling bored because of how smoothly everything went. Basically no one would interact with me or even acknowledge I was there.
---
Then I looked up how to play on a pserver. Loaded one up. Made a druid. Struggled a bit to get to level 10 and other players along the way helped me out. We grouped up. We did quests. We exchanged buffs. There was a sense of danger! It was exciting again.
---
Basically, I went from "probably just nostalgia" to "I think I'm gonna play Classic".
---
Im not following. What does a shooter game have to do with wow classic?
---
so tell them
---
in their threads
---
Just think of them as separate realms, because that is the specific scenario they're designed to replace.
---
Horde.
---
Not bartender, but I've been using Dominos in the beta and that one is working without error.
---
I usually just wave or thank them since the only biff I have is water walking and I usually don't have the reagents half the time :/
---
The prince that was promised, the real Azhor Ahai
---
Something to note, I have heard but cannot confirm, if you run both Mining/Herb you'll have to constantly switch in between the two types of tracking on the minimap as you can't track both at the same time. If this is the case, running skinning as a second resource gatherer to 60 would probably be more ideal. 
---
That was how it used to be wayback when, but maybe this is something Blizz has decided is a quality of life worth making more modern.
---
Oh shit you are right it was like that. Might run skinning is it is like that good call
---
From my experience alliance are a bit better due to paladins. In wpvp and bgs. Paladins are just so useful. Between freedom, being able to bubble then run into a a raid group and toss an arcane bomb. Imo alliance have the edge
---
it will be interesting to see. that's for sure.
---
As if Alliance needed more pve favor.
---
Still no idea. Ive played Vanilla and do not remember this name.
---
Eh, I'm not invoking #nochanges, but ruin is a big word. I actually find it quite fun to exchange knowledge of obscure map exploits and chase exploiters down. The only problematic ones are those where you get behind the flag spot anyway, as they take long to get there and put the FC in a very advantageous position. Pretty much every other one just puts you in a vulnerable spot where you're just banking on nobody knowing how to get there quickly. In some cases you can't even really leave them even when the flag is returned because you're surrounded.
---
I also find that these exploits are rarely used even on private servers, so they don't really feel game breaking to me at all. Maybe the anonymity that'll come with cross-realm BG's will make them worse though. I won't resist their removal anyway, for it is entirely justified, but I can't agree with them 'ruining' BG's.
---
Diablo doesn't have and never has had the same population that wow has. Comparing apples to oranges. Not even same game genre.
---
Probably changes nothing for alliance because salv is so good for DPS. Horde DPS is usually threat capped on lots of fights.
---
Not sure this is what my guild leader said our comp was.
---
Yeah, it still is
---
Thats what makes druid leveling so expensive.
---
Yes. And the event ass ongoing at least 30 min before esfand logged on.
---
I’m actually pretty keen on min maxing, but the gear is my issue with gnomes, the single best part of the game is completely fucked because nobody can see how decked you are.
---
This guy memes
---
That's a joke question, right?
---
Why is it when there is a share holder meeting every single person who holds 1 share doesn't speak? Why is it those with millions of shares do speak? Some peoples opinions matter and most peoples opinions don't because there is no weight behind them.
---
  
---
Why should I listen to your or his projections for blizzard when you don't even run your own business and have no affiliation with blizzard?  You and him are absolutely less qualified to speak on this than many people and should be ignored.
---
My buffs have herpes though, and I don't warn you.
---
r/Titlegore
---
Oh for sure, I never could have MT'd a raid. But as a secondary tank for MC and BWL fights, my survivability was fine with +def gear.
---
Not sure I'll be able to find a guild like that this time around, I'll most likely spend a lot of money respeccing if I started raiding again.
---
~~Spell batching~~ intentionally reintroducing lag, lmfao.
---
Why not just move the servers to Antarctica, disable spell batching and way Blizzard saves on cooling and everybody gets to experience the garbage 2004 lag. Win/win/win situation if you ask me!
---
i'm the warlock (dotmafia) in this group, and you couldn't let the boss get more than a single melee swing on any party member, the strat we used was to pull him back into the large room, mage spam fb rank 1, warrior hamstring, both warlocks let dots roll whilst fearing the whole time. Boss will combo his uppercut, aoe and melee swing upon first contact, which is about 400 damage, and we all had around 200hp \~
---
&gt; Back in the day alliance was known for being full of 12 year olds that didnt want to play with the "ugly" races
---
The hell you on about? LOTR was massive around that time, and orcs were cool as balls. I stuck with Night elf because my brother was alliance, personally. And elves were the second coolest. Metal was also growing pretty well and undead were considered really cool from that perspective as well. Trolls were probably the most underwhelming.
---
Though I'm not sure where you got your metrics to make a claim like that in the first place.
---
I've been going out of my way to buff randoms with my priest as well as give any green boe's I have to them if they use the item, ie. warrior - mail, rogue leather agi items etc. 
---
I've gotten so many good feels from people being genuinely happy and thankful to get a much needed green around level 10-15 ^_^.
---
GOD EMPEROR OMAR
---
No but there are some encounters where standing behind the boss might not be an option or there's at least a part of the fight where it can't happen.
---
 Paladins gives Alliance too much of an edge in PvE, which means there will be more pve guilds Ally side. And Ironforge is GOAT city in Classic. You save 10+ minutes over Horde when going to all of the most popular dungeons and raids, that shit adds up

Not so sure about that you have no way of slowing the target it really hurts you when doing elits. And the /sit thing to proc reckoning hurts aswell
---
Stop generalizing it is like that in some areas.
---
Those "press F6 to report a bug" tooltips are just there because they're humble.
---
retail bad
---
According to the stat guys on this thread, most say this parry change is far more impactful than the higher armor on pvserver bosses.
---
ok sperg
---
It's the opposite, I'm pretty sure - the mob that parries has its swing timer reduced by about 40%ish, not the defending player. So more boss parries = more boss white damage.
---
Where can you see on the launcher that you have been given beta access?
---
Wouldn't it be everyone gets 1/39th of the dip spent, or is the person receiving the item getting a 1/40th rebate on it?
---
This guy seems funny I like it
---
I mean, you all assume just because you dont want to play it others dont. And tbh i dont think alot of those who played vanilla will come back, but those who never got to experience will. For every 1 person i see that doesn't want to play it i see about 20 or so that do.
---
i bound a /ty macro as a rogue in the beta. Can't do much else.
---
So #1, yeah. Fair. Might not be the case in 20 mans.
---
#2. Super wrong to look at. Like, super, super silly to think that way.
---
ISFJ rolling a Troll Shaman. One of the under representer personalities playing the least represented class for that type.
---
Normally get to 10 and go to westfall but im thinking of going to darkshore instead since a lot of people will go to westfall.
---
it took ALOT of reapplying fear, about one in every 4 of my spells hit, (i'm the warlock Dotmafia in the group), basically as long as i had agony, wanding and fear up, he was slowly dying. he moves incredibly quick, so warrior has to maintain hamstring and mage rank 1 frostbolt.
---
this post gave me PTSD
---
This little pamlet got me into WOW back when i first bought Wc3. The wait felt like forever.
---
There was a guild on my server during vanilla/BC, NAGA STOLE MY BIKE
---
One of my all time favorites
---
That Talbuk was a sweet mount though along with the warbear it was the only ground mount I used.  So much swag.
---
Yes. But now it's and escalator.
---
I'm not going to change your mind, but for stress tests it makes sense to focus everyone in not just one faction but one starting zone. Human kind of just is the default.
---
Or he is coming from Battle for Azeroth wow
---
&gt; Back in the day alliance was known for being full of 12 year olds that didnt want to play with the "ugly" races,
---
That’s not what I saw. I saw Horde as all the edge lord teenagers wanting to play the evil looking side.
---
r/wowservers
---
Do prebis without Dire Maul.
---
Why would somebody "covet" a personality type? What kind of sense does that even make?
---
On a boss monster its 14% parry 8% dodge 8% miss
---
1)  Humans.
---
2)  Alliance is easy mode for PvE.
---
Yup and I’m now 26 finna rock an undead female rogue. Fuck with me
---
EVERYONE TO THRALL'S ROOM!
---
Personally agree, undead just looks to dark and perfect.
---
Lol by crickey Steve Irwin you got yourself a bugga
---
Why? Because it would be the only way to get a certain profession recipe at the end of a zone/quest chain or an upgraded armor piece that would be BiS for a new dungeons that releases. If you tie actual needs into stuff, people would do it and be ok with it. Especially if it was interesting like doing quests to rebuild or take out certain enemies that are gone next major update.  You could have grand quest chains as well. I like stylizing professions because they should feel important all the time. 
---
You could also increase reputations after exalted and have quest chains give you the new rep as a reward upon new content instead of just using new faction rep.
---
Let's face it. Leveling in wow is a joke now and it's just kinda there.
---
Thats what he meant he is just bad with wirds
---
Didnt get to see this, guess i was on a different layer :/ the classic experience
---
https://youtu.be/HUzWiQF1fMg?t=506
---
NE's have nature resist for aq20/40 and shadowmeld for pvp. Dodge isnt bad either. Plus bonus to starting agility.
---
Ahh 8%.
---
Good to know.
---
Agree. I would be happy with authentic recreations of vanilla, tbc, and wrath. After that, maybe blizzard can take a hard look at the 3 games and come up with another mmo that's good again. That would be the pipe dream for me.
---
I think there are some powerful mmo tenets to be found in those games...

is there a reason the server is still up?

103
---
Rested XP caps at 1.5 levels
---
That's what he said, although the victim part makes it harder, I think they meant victim as in the person that parries is the victim. Since they mention the tanks would take more damage
---
Just sit and proc enrage...
---
I am partial to you slipped on dinosaur dung in Un'goro. You are still level 50 and that was all a dream.
---
No. Only the most hardcore guilds care. Even on my pserver I’m the only night elf rogue in the guild. The rest are human. I was 3rd in melee dps behind 2 warriors and top 5 overall. The rest weren’t even close. The racials from humans really don’t mean much if you know your class well. I’m also the rogue class leader. Play what you want. Unless you are in a massive guild your guild has 40 raid spots to fill. They will take what they can get.
---
Is this only for Tauren or all races? Because I really want to ride a Raptor with my Orc.
---
No they aren't good at farming, besides lowbie crap. They can solo difficult stuff, they just take forever to do it - so the actual gold per hour will be terrible to mage/hunter/warlock.
---
Congrats! Seems like you put lot of skill on that :)
---
Well the problem is their are dozens of pservers. 
---
I play on K3 and in my experience dungeons for players 13-40 are cakewalks. There are occasional bosses that trip you up but mobs do very little damage to a properly leveled group. I just ran BFD (average level ~26) and the tank was regularly pulling mobs of 4 elites without any risk to his life. Most bosses presented zero difficulty and could probably be killed with 3 people.
---
It's not about my feelings, but if Classic is really a nerfed version of shit is going to be a hell of a yawnfest.
---
Then your absolute madman of a tank tries to pull everything at the bottom lol
---
Nope, this time around I’m actually going to be taking the questing experience really slow, and actually read the text word for word. 
---

I have 4 level 10s in the beta. One has looted a full rack of 6 slot bags. The others zero each. The RNG Gos have spoken, that shall be my main.
---
The stress test is invite only. You have to have a current wow sub and be opted into classic beta to get an invite.
---
I don't see why this would be the case, the 16 debuff limit is what limits raid comp more than anything else.

My experience with it was largely people doing so essentially trolling to grief and drag out games.  I don't really agree on there not being advantages though. There are a handful of these spots, a few of which are literally right next to the cap or nearby so that you can insta-cap if your team kills the enemy FC, all the while the enemy team has to go through some hoops to get to your spot.  They can be amusing for a bit but become really tiring as they become more known and then everyone wants their chance to do it.  All in all it's just bad for the game in what's meant to be a competitive environment.
---
&gt; Who said anything about owning stock anyway? you’re remarks are getting more and more dumb. 
---
What do you think owning a company actually means. What do you think owning a share actually is. A person who owns 1% is a cowner to someone who owns 99% and that statement is equally valid for both but useless. I'm a "co owner" of every fortune 500 company. Why don't you use useful terms like majority share holder or something of value other than "co owner". 
---
What kind of businessmen doesn't understand that stock is a percentage of ownership in a company. Your a fucking retard and you probably run a lemonade stand
---
Have am upvote!

People on the server is kinda unaware of this i asked several ppl they seem pretty clueless about this , and yes i saw what blizzard wrote about at that time on the yellow message ;/ ;) im just waiting for them to confirm what they meant by it ;D
---
The beta isn’t over. I don’t mind getting under SW or on top of IF. I do want this one fixed though. The other 2 doesn’t effect everyone’s game. This does though.

Viable is fire (pyro is just too fun) 
---
Arcane I’ve never tried, but I imagine arcane missile spam could be fun, if a bit mana consuming.
---
will be really intresting
---
Took the screenshot when it just started. But indeed compared to Alliance we have no one.
---
That's true, they came but and did that after the server restart. They did a lot more for the Alliance though, and Kalimdor was still crashing over and over during the Hogger stuff.
---
Happy I got to play of course but that ending was a bit of a bummer from Horde side.
---
Imagine if they had only 1 more year to create content. 
---
They only really started making content the last year before WoW release, the earliers years were mostly to figure out what the systems would be, how the game would feel and look, the gameplay, figuring technical issues etc...
---
The majority of the content was produced in the last year. In the alpha builds in 2004 they added new dungeons and zones to the game every few weeks.
---
Blackfathom and monastery in april 2004, gnomeregan and uldaman in june, sunken temple+razorfen in july, hunter class boats and zepelins in august, blackrock spire+stratholme+tram in september... And that's only talking about dungeons.
---
The content could have been doubled if they went for another year of production, but obviously it would have been ridiculous in a financial point of view the base game was more than enough.
---
Alliance I think were already goofing around in the city so.
---
He didn't report it right away on stream. Going to the forums right now!!

Back in Vanilla I always saw it as;
---
PvE oriented players leaned Alliance
---
PvP oriented players leaned Horde
---
Now I know that is mostly BS.
---
They are free to do that as long as they do it on a fresh server.
---
I don't think it does... that'd be pretty overpowered!
---
I just wanted to make a point that Overwatch was Blizzard taking a huge risk.
---
Instead of scrapping titan they chose to make something of it, and what they made was stellar for a company that up until that point had only created RPG and RTS games (Minus Rock'n'Roll racing, which was my favorite game to play at my friends place).
---
One thing at a time, it’s not like Classic is there only project.
---
Funny considering Trolls are probably the best Horde race for Warriors, yet you never saw many of them.

I love listening to this guy. If you haven’t had the chance yet check him out on twitch or on the countdown to classic podcast. He made WoW Vanilla classes as a lead developer back then and gives great insight.
---
Is there a PDF version I can find ? I really want to read it but don't want to order a book.
---
So beautiful
---
I mean Kalimdor was crashing constantly throughout the 24 hours, so I don't think they wanted people to just go Alliance. Clearly things were funky and need testing/fixing on Horde.
---
What mod is giving your hp % and #? Assuming its not supported natively
---
They should really put up some invisible walls then.
---
Not a liar, Mind Control has a sort of buffer on it where you could cast a spell while Mind controlling someone and it applied as mind control stopped the channel. This stopped being a thing in the middle or end of Cata. I played shatteplay and would MC enemy healers and Life Grip them into Ring of Frost.

keybinds is easiest and ik its possible by copying ur bindings-cache in ur WTF folder, outside of that i think ur addons and macros will easily be done however the addons gota work for their servers not just the private servers.
---
Lol damn this is so awesome.
---
Private server addons use the old 1.12 client and are built for that.
---
Classic will use 8.x client and that infrastructure, so retail UI will be more easy to convert. ElvUI will likely be the go-to UI for classic once it's converted.
---
I main'ed a holy priest during Vanilla. I easily healed everything as shadow till the mid 50s before switching to holy for the last few levels. 
---
I could have stayed shadow till 60 and healed just fine, it was more personal preference to respec. 
---
I also lvl'ed a war as fury and tanked fine until switching to prot at 60.
---
As long as you have the gear (1h sword and shield for tank or as much +healing gear you can get for a healer) and a basic understanding of the role you can tank and heal fine pre 60 as a dps spec.
---
A non miner/Skinner or engineer/blacksmith warrior?

Should've just given the group a choice: him or you. Nobody wants to kick a tank.

Last week I was in South Palawan which for those who don't know is the territory of the Muslim Islamic Liberation Front or (MILF) which has in the last few years pledged allegiance and support to ISIS. South Palawan is actually the refugee for fighters fleeing from Mindanao where there is heavy fighting between the Americans/PH/Contractors and ISIS/MILF/Cartels.  There are vigilante checkpoints of farmers strip searching vehicles on the jungle roads in south here looking for fighters and people walk around with rifles.

The data doesn’t show that from what I can tell.
---
Nah just uncommons :p
---
Nost lol
---
Where you from? We got plenty of room and will have pizza and beer if you wanna join!
---
Honestly tauren barely do either. I think the Alliance generally have the same goals in mind but with the Horde every race seems to really have entirely separate ideals and goals for their respective factions.
---
Reminder that Nolstarius had 150K MAU before Blizzard shut 'em down.
---
This is free money for Blizzard. Once this thing is stable, they never have to update it again.
---
But thats what servers do anyways? They reset everything and start a new 'season'
---
Saaaame omg. I forgot all about this place. I loved the little scarab room
---
You forgot the tauren kick animation
---
My question is about who are finding the bugs?  There are definitely diligent testers out there.  But the more, the merrier.    But we need testers.  Not players.  Right now, we're stupid things like world first beta this.  PvP this.  Or that.  Like some Billboard sign.
---
But with Blizz official I know as long as there is a game I have my characters.
---
I think they all ended with a forced name change eventually as well
---
So more rage and in turn, more threat generated?
---
I completely agree the balance point was best at wotlk.
---
You can use it before the mages spec fire or if you don't bring a shadow priest, but otherwise no.
---
I was being sarcastic or mocking of people.
---
Blizzard favors xxxx faction posts!!! Kicking the nostalgia train into high gear for me now, take it easy OP I can only handle so much ready for August!
---
&gt; it'll make every encounter rather dramatically more difficult than on private servers. It's a major nerf to threat generation
---
it wont make any difference to 90% of guilds, most guilds cant rip aggro off a full prot warrior on current private servers itll only matter for guilds who actually need super high threat tanks like feral or fury warriors but even then the gap of threat after the start of the fights and how fast they die i doubt itll change much at all
---
SMOrc me not stupid SMOrc

---
its 2 tauren hitting each other so you're seeing it at it's worst
---
the are trying to recreate vanilla 
---
they are not trying to buipd a wow fan server
---
I see it I was missing it on the table.
---
Looks like a desk space issue in this case
---
This comp is wrong first off.
---
It's biased for the reasons you said.
---
Nothing much more to it :) alliance will be more populated and have longer bg queues.
---
Gnomes 4 life
---
Lovelu, would have loved to see the Race factored in the data aswell!
---
I can only imagine how you feel man, I bet your old Guildmaster is proud of the person you've become :)
---
It’s 40%.
---
seriously we need a copy of the old WoW forums to cross-reference these greatest hits
---
Source? Why does alliance outnumber alli 2:1? Why does alliance have a million extra level 5s?
---
Sounds like cancer
---
I thought it was just since its beta.
---
But yea I'm starting to reconsider. Seems Alliance will be way more populated.
---
How did you come to that conclusion? I'm 28 and was alliance in vanilla... my thought is going horde for classic but the zones I'll spend so much time in depress me compared to alliance :(
---
Will say prefer org to stormwind, but IF over all, just so damn hard for me to go against the alliance.
---
Wow is 15 years old, 12+15=27

---
This is actual 2006 footage... and he goes WAY further than OP's clip. (the voip is the alliance premade's ventrilo lol)
---
I played a Paladin from 1-10 on the stresstest server and I saved some people here and there that would've died to mobs. Their 'ty' makes me feel like a true hero.
---
parryhaste depends on the attack speed of the mob you are fighting, and how close they are to their next swing. if a boss has a 3.0 attack speed, and he parries your attack when he has 2.5 seconds left before his next attack, it simply decreases the time until his next attack by a percentage of the overall attack speed. however, if a boss has like less than a second left until his next attack, and he parries your attack, he will strike instantly
---
Nostalrius bruh 🤣
---
Sometimes I help others farm HKs
---
[Not a bug](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-not-a-bug-list/175887).
---
He's right about one thing. You're definitely on the spectrum.
---
Probably puts Rogues slightly above Warriors as the #1 Dps. Fights are still probably going to be significantly easier in Classic than they are on private servers.
---
I think the opposite.  There is every reason to believe that the majority of players are playing and not testing.  The streamers have their legion of fans and Blizzard eating out of their hand.  They are providing the "hype".  But in terms of making sure Classic is a better product, they are doing zilch.   And since really, all we see are streamer after streamer after streamer related posts and video, and people who do report potential bugs with maybe wrong numbers, get shot down viciously, you think it's far fetched?
---
If, I'm wrong and everyone else is testing,  then that's awesome.
---
No
---
15 years ago called and they want their forum post back.
---
You just put one single boot on the end of their tale.
---
If this shit happened on my server I would 100% get in there and gank.
---
I wanna play horde for the nostalgia of my teenage years 
---
I prefer playing PvP over raiding and my young self was a troll rogue with is dumb so now I’m gonna go undead for the racial
---
I love the horde zones but I also have leveled a lot of characters in my days and know them very well
---
Aslong as y'all know we mean well
---
What can you do as hunter. :/
---
Hey all. Continuing my Memories of Vanilla series, I finally got up to one of my favorite zones in Classic - Felwood. What do you guys remember about this zone from back in the day?
---
oh my god lol
---
&gt; "...slightly larger than other races."
---
I'm not saying it's not a bug... but that's not "slightly" lol
---
Wow, I didn't know that site was still going.
---
Yeah, which makes a whole lot of sense to me now! Idk. I'm playing Alliance, that's as far as I've got so far.
---
I'm assuming you've heard of Pantheon: rise of the fallen?
---
It is really much more of  spiritual successor to EQ than EQ next ever was.
---
I couldnt agree more
---
Alliance was mostly families, religious people, and little kids. Parents who played wow didn't want their kids rolling horde because we were dropping f bombs and talking about how god doesn't exist.
---
Literally my experience. Warsong server (before it became overrun with BR and huehuehuehue)
---
I know when I bought my physical copy from the kickstarter, I got a PDF download with it. Maybe it's available somewhere?
---
Unending breath AND detect invisibility. The latter especially in stv.
---
I'm guessing it's a one time use item?
---
Troll priests in need I see.
---
Walljumping is confirmed dead and you can't do it in the beta. Just making sure you don't mistake what Soda is doing here for Walljumping.
---
I was in org last night on a level 1 and it was completely empty.  Not sure if I was on a bad later or something.  Then made a human and went to SW and it was absolutely packed
---
\&gt;he goes through an entire year of my post history because I disagree with him
---
\&gt;im on the spectrum

---
NO! The joy of vanilla wow is that it takes awhile to level so you will learn abilities and gear naturally. If you struggle a lot, maybe google some guides. otherwise have fun
---
Once while on the phone with my high school best friend, my phone ran out of battery and I shouted "I gotta go my phone is OOM".
---
It's not really an advantage considering you can hit them from further away too
---
My fiance (a paladin) had this interaction with a warrior:
---
Warrior: give me might
---
Fiance: say please
---
Warrior: fuck u give me might
---
Fiance: *blessing of wisdom*
---
Warrior: fuck u
---
Absolutely my favorite vanilla interaction I have ever witnessed.
---
Are servers still up? 👀
---
its fun to design and dream!
---
It was the same last stress test, alliance got a bunch of stuff, horde got nothing. I love the interaction with the community and all, I just wish they’d include both factions.
---
but more player isnt equal more money ;p 
---
the playerbase nowadays is way more likely to purchase additional things in the store/microtransactions.
---
the same people who buy extra life in candy crush buy wow shoppets/mounts, pay 50euro for a blizzcon virtul ticket for a cosmetic ah lets not forget about chars boosts :P
---
and what is also way underratd: wow tokens. basically a small minority pays wow sub for a lot of people but instead 13euro blizzard gets 20 out of them.
---
boosting some idiots to 2k rating in 2v2 arena for a couple of hours gave me wow tokens for the of the year.
---
its a garbage developement but they dont care about 8mio subs and rather have these "whales" 
---
FeelsBadMan.
---
Alliance swine will be ganked relentlessly come Classic!!
---
Been playing private server as i still dont know which class to main
---
but why would you play tauren shaman for pvp anyway?
---
They counter goblins best in terms of size and being tech-savy. Horde just didn’t get Goblins till cata.
---
Didn't read the description on that one? 😅
---
I don’t like player housing. It’s a nice idea but ultimately serves to take people out of the world and away from their character, and implementing it right is a nightmare.
---
I still find his response to be the biggest slap in the face to WoW fans 
---
I hope Classic blows up the servers and shows Blizz that people are much more interested in Classic than they are Retail
---
Changes nothing? Loooooool
---
Tanks do less DPS and TPS
---
Melee does less DPS
---
Bosses will be overall harder to kill vs Pservers
---
This also means casters will use more Mana.
---
But ya you're right. It changes nothing 4Head.
---
Warlocks gonna be sad.
---
You have no idea what you are talking about.
---
Down for good this time.
---
I know, but the constant " you think you do but you don't post" are pissing me off. And this is coming from a guy who has got to level 10 in the stress test and watched more classic streams then I'm proud to say.
---
Same. And for this reason I support it. Also, wasn't there another free range PvP location? I feel like there was, but no chest reward.
---
...and it's over, kiddos. :'(
---
Blizzard is also not a small indie company with just a couple of rts games published under their belt, they're a triple A gaming monolith Blizzard Activision lmfao. If you're gonna compare the past to the future you might as well include other pertinent differences and not just cherry pick. It's not totally out of this universe to expect acti-blizz to be able to do better.
---
Just so people understand. What Soda is doing here is NOT walljumping.
---
The first jump Soda does which puts him halfway up that 'brown' wall is completely normal. Walljumping would be if he could continue to jump from that position and be stuck further up the brown wall without colliding with any obstacles.
---
Smithing and mining
---
Gotta get that Lionhardt helm.
---
Which is pretty crappy compared to sword/maces.
---
13. 
---
14 is the weapon.
---
They can, but modifying servers that are advertised as classic then updating it with new things would be bad. They will have less backlash if they start it as a separate project.
---
Any rogue/warrior not terrible will never attack from in front and never get parried regardless.
---
Warrior, rogue or hunter are good bets.  Shamans were fun, so we're mages.
---
Look at all the streamers.
---
It's almost as if they could avoid all the mmorpg killing elements of phasing by spending more resources on servers...
---
Frigging Warriors, man... SUNDER ARMOR!!!
---
because the most influential theory crafting of the day was badly wrong. Former devs of prominent servers have confirmed it on discord.
---
According to the timestamp on my screenshot, I killed some guy this way on Nov 8th, 2006, but it was in the Wetlands, and it was a Raptor.
---
We still could kick!
---
T\_T
---
Official crying threat for ppl without even acess to stress test
---
It’s not gay if it’s in a 3-way. With a honey in the middle there’s some leeway.
---
Yeah I can understand that, keep was an absolute clusterfuck. All from Thrall, to Patchwerk vs. 4 Thralls, to Sapphiron, to multiple Vancleefs and even when 2 minutes left we got Maexxna and a hoard of spiderlings.
---
Yeah, the person getting it did 1/40th of the work too, so that would be accounted for.
---
That was incredible fun-so many screenshots.
---
I feel gutted that it's now over until the next stress test-I didn't want it to finish.  Feel sad it is now
---
Tank prio on Crul'shoruk!
---
Herb/alchemy for my warrior gotta pound them healing potions like an alcoholic down liquor!
---
Tons of people on the org bank at the end spamming /cry....I love this damn game.
---
I remember that feeling. 
---
Also the time I was pally tanking and accidentally hit bubble :/
---
Also Warlocks, priests,  and paladins are pretty fun too.
---
Fuck.
---
Hi, /u/RedTempest, your post has been removed as it is seems to be talking about the current stress test. Please use the current [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bui555/stress_test_2_the_megathread_of_omg_why_can_i_not/) instead.
---
I feel bad when you chase after me. Sometimes I buff late, i'll be looking back while running, and I see some people stop, turn around and start running at me. I try to stop and meet them halfway but it's totally fine to just accept my buff if i'm out of range :)
---
Not really. Once they find out what char it is, you'll just have to add it to your flist and you'll know where he is currently
---
I feel gutted that it's now over until the next stress test-I didn't want it to finish. Feel sad it is now
---
So subtle..  I love this!
---
Hi, /u/frieza1993
---
Still lower value. If you have 20% crit, +1% crit strike isn't +1%, its about .83% (1/1.2) increase.
---
Of course it's A Current Affair, the bottom of the barrel garbage Aussie "news" programme that sensationalises anything it can for viewership. 
---
Funny to look back on though.
---
You're wrong and you know it
---
100% agree. It’s little things like this that are waking me up to the broader impact it has one the community.
---
That's not slightly at all, that's way too big.
---
Ah okay, good to know. Thanks
---
I’ll be surprised when it’s 1 tauren and 1 anything else
---
agree with this. also pally blessing of salv and self-bubbles make raid progression easier for alliance. Generally the top guild on a server will be an alliance guild. So all this leads to alliance premades stacked with gear before horde generally
---
Well they are more than slightly larger than other races.
---
They can literally block out their names like they do with chat.
---
Lol nice, so you’re basing your professions to enhance the leveling experience? Alc will probably be a good money maker later on
---
Possibly lw/skinning on my shaman. Or herb/alchemy.
---
I endorse this idea and complex storytelling behind it. Have an upvote
---
1h/shield Impale/Prot will still be viable.  If TPS is an issue, you swap out for some threat pieces.  This is nothing new.  Druids will be good tanks in Classic, but they are not as good for DPS so they will not rule any tier.  They will most certainly be seen more often than they were in Vanilla.  They have TPS issues of their own, though.
---
[Latest Blue Post](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/stress-test-complete-thank-you/187518) regarding the Stress Test from Kaivax
---
:
---
&gt; We have now completed the WoW Classic Stress Test that began yesterday at 2:00 p.m. PDT. We’re very pleased with the amount of participation we saw, and we’re happy to report that we got a great deal of highly useful data, as well as new issues that were uncovered by your efforts to log in and play.
---
&gt;The closed beta realms remain available for those testers.
---
&gt;Thank you very much to everyone who participated in this stress test!
---
Good thing the world server kept going down so we couldn't kill him, lol.
---
wheres the pizza
---
Fort buffs from priests can be pretty juicy at several stages of lvling. It's super helpful.
---
Yeah the game plan is to level a rogue alongside my warrior with mining and herbing to feed the alchemy. Then stock pile the bars then drop herbing on the war for engineering (or maybe BSing to craft my own lion hearts, then engineering)
---
How many months exactly?
---
I'll very likely be maining priest.
---
While leveling: Tailoring. This is certain, I seem to recall some of the crafted gear was amazing. Probably compliment that with herbalism.
---
After I've crafted the gear.. I'm thinking Herbalism/alchemy. I've had some thoughts about enchanting but I've some memories of enchanting being absolutely horrible.
---
lol
---
I have no doubt that the top guilds will clear every raid instance within days of it being released - they're old raids after all. Method mostly struggles with opaque mechanics and lack of knowledge more than execution in modern raids. 
---
For me, what's no longer certain is how quickly *average* guilds will be able to push through it. This is a colossal buff to every single boss in the game compared to pservers - and I'm not sure the community is sufficiently grappling with the emphasis on sustain, threat management, recruitment challenges, and the absence of escape cooldowns that come with classic raiding. 
---
I guess we'll see. (And for the record, I would much prefer that raiding be relatively easier now, as I don't want to commit more than 2 nights a week to it).
---
Hi, /u/ScarletDarkling
---
You think they are stupid, but there not
---
inb4 chain lightning bolt
---
oh hey that’s my raid team! had a blast!
---
I got a stern talking to by a GM for doing this exact thing about a decade and a half ago, scared 13 year old me straight. Good to see that nothing really changes.
---
Its really too bad they removed the 'kill all entities in 30 yards'. 
---
I would love to have seen Omar pull it out on a group of 400 stress testers.
---
At this level of Blizzard isn’t going to allow more people in to play, the hype is likely to burn out with those NOT in the beta with all of this stuff.
---
So many things people have wanted for so long and it’s only being done to a select small group
---
no, having a swing or ability parried is going to result in a net loss of threat generated in most circumstances.
---
https://imgur.com/a/1P18tru
---
100%. I was running around earlier leveling my throwback Paladin (same name and look as my retail main who I made back during vanilla) and started getting buffs from passing strangers, thanked them with a nice /bow or /salute and it really brought back that old feel that I had when I was 14... except now I don’t keyboard turn, click my abilities, or insist that my Ret Pally needs a shield for “more armor and better blocking”.
---
&gt; most guilds cant rip aggro off a full prot warrior on current private servers
---
It's a threat nerf to all kinds of tanks.
---
Who cares dude, people just want to participate
---
whats all this streamer video flooding this subreddit  ? if one want to watch it one can go to twitch.. stop promoting your favorite streamer here..
---
You could but I dunno if it would gain much traction. Only people in raiding guilds that are clearing everything would even try. You'd need to ban MC cap at the very least, probably only of each class and limited consumables too. People with AQ/Naxx level shadow/frost resist sets could get pretty silly if they know who they will face.    
---
     
---
Like you say it's pretty easy to setup so if it's fun and people want to then yeah it'll probably happen.
---
This exactly! I love helping people. Especially in Vanilla with how much love I have for Vanilla. I want you to experience the joy that I felt all those years ago.
---
My friends say they don't want to get into beta/stress test because they will just burn out by the time it releases in August (or shortly after) if they start now. But in reality, they're just missing out on shit like this. It won't be like this after launch.
---
The only (classic) class I've never leveled is Paladin.
---
The only profession I haven't leveled to a cap is Blacksmithing.
---
It is time.
---
Can you afford it tho
---
Me
---
Night Elves **came from** trolls. It’s like saying “humans are monkeys” as opposed to “humans came from monkeys”.
---
You can't meld in combat or what do you mean?
---
It's from Nost
---
Alliance has been more popular on every server I've ever played. It's because most people prefer the pretty LOTR races and min maxers like human racial/paladins. When one faction becomes dominant new player gravitate towards it
---
My guess on level 5s is gold selling spammers or fishing bots
---
A third faction would have been so awesome!
---
I do t know if you are thinking they’ll change it, but there is currently no level restriction to normal weapon skills in the beta
---
Private servers are set at 5 + skill difference \\\* 0.04, so 5.6% on bosses. It was this way because thats what the blue posts from back then told us.
---
Hello, fellow raider!
---
Got em
---
TF, Gressil and THC are all axes right.
---
You can meld in combat.
---
r/outoftheloop Who is Omar?
---
Herb and mining. Mining will transition to engineering. Phase 2 when I get an alt caught up I can put herbalism there and support alchemy on the main. Might also do alchemy on the alt too, since this will be the phase for selling arcanite transmutes.
---
i think you are projecting your own excitement and think everyone is on the same boat.. most people are calm and will wait for classic launch in august..
---
Oh right.
---
As a mage I've saved many a nice hordes ass with a sheep heal, followed by many emotes to let them know I'm not here to hurt them, followed by a wanting to pop it.
---
Seeing shenanigans in wow is what really takes me back
---
stop promoting twitch streamer here
---
We did this in my 19 twink guild in tbc. It is known.
---
Something tells me you play Overwatch.
---
vanilla was good in some aspects but nothing will ever top Wotlk Arena in a mmorpg
---
The point is that it's a big nerf to tank threat generation. Fury warriors can't dump threat so Rogues and push more.
---
My first (and last) experience playing on an RP-PVP server was getting yelled at for running instead of walking between the IF bank and auction house. That is just not for me.
---
High end guilds don’t take one at all, you can get a healing priest with shadow weaving to do their job but better. Having an spriest is basically giving up 3 debuff slots for a little bit of extra damage for a class that’ll likely be threat capped anyway.
---
Just reroll priest, run around for a few hours until you find them, buff them and then return to your rogue.
---
With all of the kickass music taken out... Kind of ruins it...
---
Any chance you still have it?
---
No, its 6.5 dodge.
---
Has there been any GM's show up on Horde?
---
Seems all the clips/highlights off betas are all about Alliance. Kinda worrying.
---
OP you’re right that it would be a better game but no one will go along with it on principle
---
They'll call it Project TITAN, WoW 2.0. We'll be able to transfer our old WoW characters to the new system and everything. :\^)
---
fuck retail
---
I loved what BC did to improve the classes, but vanilla's game world was just a better design from start to finish. There's something to be said for a massively cohesive world spanning 60 levels, everything flows more naturally.
---
TBC and every expansion pack thereafter feels like high level island, like you're in a high level instance.
---
Hi Meva,
---
awesome work. Since many point out the observation, that this general distribution of personality types is so very different from general society, I was wondering about how this would look if normalized.
---
I went ahead and normalized your numbers against the distribution in the observed "player society". I added a segment on "how to read" to understand how I got to these figures.
---
The figures show which personality types are more/less likely in this average "player society".
---
Positive numbers are "x % more likely" to be this personality tye and negative numbers vice versa.

---
yea real epic "checkmate" there bud
---
Yeah, youre right. If that isn't a bug and sticks around for release, I'm definitely switching races  to tauren. It'll make getting my warrior in range of casters so much easier.
---
I remember venturing too far north while questing in the enchanted Forest and ending up in Deadwood and getting one shot by bears and wolves with bubonic
---
Good times
---
Rogue here -
---
I'll be doing Mining/Engineering, mostly because engineering is really fun (and good for PVP) and mining supports it while making decent money past having Engineering leveled up.
---
Did yall have a streamer?
---
The Room live shows are just the best.
---
PSA: Do not watch this YouTube video, because the music is fucking muted.
---
Instead go to the top comment, by mute, and follow the links to the original files.
---
ye 10% such huge difference 4Head wont make it any less trivial content than it is on pserver. still will get steamrolled they day of release. isntead of 15 people you now need 20people with more iq than fingers 4Head LOL
---
Enlightening.
---
No popular Horde streamer, no :(
---
A GM named ZP(?) appeared for a few seconds before we got DC'd at one point during Pentagram construction.  Not sure what their intent or purpose was though.

This is so awesome, congrats guys!

Sure but ideally you want a small hit box but big reach as well. Ele sham sometimes uses Meele attacks too in pvp.

&gt; People have to choose to make friends. Blizzard can't force anything.

It's not hard to create a situation where players will choose to make friends though, and Classic already does a lot of things that way.  The simple combination of needing help to progress efficiently and not having effortless access to that help (through cross-realm group/dungeon/raid/etc) sets up game conditions where players are better off finding friends than they are going solo.
---
Saw the amount of players on Alliance compared to Horde during the last phase of the second stress test. I know it's just a beta, but I just hope to not become a minority once it releases hehe
---
Are you genuinely bothered? Is this sarcasm? I cannot fathom a person being upset that they didn't see a Gm ...
---
There is no honour in this!
---
It looks like it's not. I guess I will have to wait
---
Who needs to exploit when you just give a decked out Prot Warrior the flag and watch as no one can kill him.
---
Yeah, I'm not saying it will be a big nerf but even on Private server there are times where threat gets sensitive and in those scenarios Rogues pull ahead. In Classic it seems like this will be happening more often.
---
It is if you're trying to run away, but theyre still hitting you from much further away.
---
Yeah I heard somewhere that it will be changed to have level 10 requirement
---
sadly that is not at its worst, if both taurens are moving they will be able to hit each other from even further away because of leeway. https://www.twitch.tv/perplexitycya/clip/OptimisticSmilingFungusBudBlast?filter=clips&amp;range=7d&amp;sort=time really fking hope they change it before launch
---
my only regret as a rogue.  I have nothing to give.  only things to fence.
---
alliance is for narcs
---
lmao i imagine ants doing this
---
when part of what determines if players 'take time' to make friends is dependent on their own personal level of burnout
---
that's not something blizzard can control; how much we choose to play
---
That's true, if anything it's a nerf to horde side warriors and warlocks. Warriors will be taking more damage though as well so it's hard to say exactly how much TPS they will lose.
---
I dont remember needing to provide a phone number to get on Vent or TS. Not doubting this, but I cant recall how/why this was ever needed. I remember it just being an IP based software that was an overlay for the game

---
Nobody will use dkp the new shit is lootcouncil even if you are in an average guild which means like lead+his friends&gt;you.
---
Horde is for dipshit wannabe hardasses. ICP level cringe nerds.
---
Oh I agree probably a bad idea. Just sayin
---
I'm not proposing they add it just on its own in like a vacuum. If they add it, also make it give reasons to get back out into the world. Heck, maybe implement a system that rewards player for inviting each other to their place, such as the summonable bosses from WoD. 
---
Or heck, maybe don't necessarily have it instanced. Maybe have a few plots out in the world people can compete over like in FFXIV. Though that system has its own flaws.
---
I'd say: make an instanced housing zone, but hen match players together in a "neighborhood" or heck, maybe even together as a guild.
---
I feel like a bunch of players were burned by Garrisons, but that wasn't player housing. It had minimal customization despite being promised as something a bit more grandiose. 
---
I think Garrisons failed because they removed any need to leave whatsoever. You had a mission table that just pooped gold, you could farm all the mats from your mine and herb garden, you could fish and check the auction house with the right buildings. Even resources would just spawn right in your base for you to collect.
---
I think its another sign that Blizz abandoned that expansion from the start. Garrisons seemed like they were intended to have so much more, then someone turned them into a Facebook game instead, which I think has actively 
---
Compare it to say, the Pandaria farm.
---
If you wanted any addition to that you had to go do a full-flown questline and rind rep with townsfolk. The crops granted resources, but only every few days and you had to keep the plants tended. I feel like Blizz, somehow, misinterpreted what happened there and thought "Aw man, players fuckin love piles of free materials. Lets make the Garrison that."
---
Anyways, thats my thoughts on the matter. And it was only an example of a way to do it. My point was, Blizz needs to bring back the world aspect of the game. The best way to do that would be to give the world some teeth again and to add things players want to go see, farm or experience.
---
U can thunderclap in battle and defensive but not berserking
---
Nelfs are the true Chads let's not kid ourselves here.
---
Why a dps shaman?
---
I think it's the distinction between the race and the faction.  i.e.  trolls vs. darkspear trolls.  They were literally undead as a "race" but the faction they belonged to was Forsaken (led by Sylvanas) rather than "the Scourge"  (controlled by the Litch King).
---
I recall needing level 10 as well. Was it changed some time during vanilla? Or has a couple of months on pservers actually skewed my memory?
---
People's opinions of 40 man raids (and a lot of other vanilla things) is going to be radically different in 6 months time from what is is now.  
---
That's not necessarily a good or bad thing, just the reality of hype and remembering and imagining what vanilla was and will be like compared with actually experiencing it.
---
Why lol
---
I grinded treeants by the northern acid lake from level 50-57ish as a mage. I no life’s straight from vanilla launch and there was barely any post lvl 50 quests at the time. Was averaging about 1.5-2 levels per day of straight grinding. From all that grinding, I also ended up with two warmonger rare 2h swords hahaha.
---
Oh look. I found another dumbass.
---
Wg was opened up for lvl 10's and there was still world pvp going on at gurbashi and raid invasions of lower lvl zones.
---
God dammit I love this
---
*grunt*
---
Retail BAD!
---
I find it major cringe that actual psychologists thought video game addiction were an illness of the mind. What a crock of shit haha
---
yes, that is Omar Gonzalez the Blizz dev who made the proof of concept to get this going on their modern hardware stack
---
Salty that you're garbage so the loot council labels you as not worthy of loot? Get good
---
You think that this sub makes up far more than 10% of the total players who will return for classic?  
---
This is a relatively small spin off sub and it's still got 120k players for a game that isn't even out yet.  
---
Yes I think a million players of classic is easy.
---
Arms/Fury tanking (depending on the patch) was the only spec Tanks who knew what they were doing would use because Deep Prot was useless before Shield Slam got buffed in 1.11
---
73.6% of statistics are made up.
---
Arena LOL.
---
That’s rather nihilistic
---
Inadequate summoning ritual.
---

Not having 1 shaman per group is pretty bad, the lack of totems for those 3 groups is gonna hurt

---
Can you prove this? :P
---
Dude I was genually scared when that thing started coming out of the ground!
---
Lol yesssssssss. They wear the baggy black pants with chains n shit. Lol.
---
Yesterday I was on a layer where SW was almost completely empty but some layers have it really really packed.  
---
Although Stormwind was the most populated city by far on stress test and I'm going to assume it will be the most populated city on release until people start raiding and go to IF.
---
I do love SM.  That's probably in my favorites as well.
---
&gt; Why? Because it would be the only way to get a certain profession recipe at the end of a zone/quest chain or an upgraded armor piece that would be BiS for a new dungeons that releases
---
but if you aren't leveling up and getting stronger gear what's the point of the new gear. If it's all at an equal level why do you need the new recipe, you already have the ability to do the content. if a new dungeon comes out and it's lvl 60 and same i lvl as curren t dungeons why do it? the experience is nice but thats only a one or two time thing.
---
We were so close

Our lord and savior.
---
Yeah, no. According to the data, the parry reduction for +5 weapon skill is maybe .4 if that’s not just noise.
---
this vaaaaaaaguely rings a bell from a spec POV actually. I do remember tanks never going all the way into the prot tree. But that's not the same as DW fury tanking (tanks still used a shield), which is what's been happening on pservers.
---
Grunt? Grats on making it to rank 2!

NA / PVP server / Horde
---
Hi ! I,m 26y old playing WoW since Vanilla,
---
I'm only playing Healing classes (I will main Priest),
---
Looking for Semi Hardcore Raiding guild, for leveling and progressing together (I enjoy PvP too)
---
I do think the social part of Classic is the most important :) Im always try to help my guildmates !
---
I mostly play on the evening (EDT), and will surely play everyday on the launch of Classic.
---
PM me if interested !
---
The information he puts out on the design intent and perspective of the vanilla devs is amazing. Highly recommend people who would like more insight to the developers thoughts to check it out!
---
That's not what I'm worried about when I'm trying to hamstring a mage. It's a clear win against casters imo.
---
They can do it, its just not very efficient and requires a little bit of decent gear. You basically just moonfire tag however many enemies you want, gather them up, Barkskin + Hurricane, Bear Form and swipe to death.
---
It works, but you're also pretty much oom and you're usually close to death after the pull. 
---
They're not the worst farmers, but its not great either.
---
This guys been trolling world chat on beta every time I get on.
---
Yeah deep prot tanks should have more rage available but as I have understood many min/maxing guilds in pservers have used fury tanking where rage wasn't a problem anyway. Either way it's definitely going to change things up. Might also hurt mages indirectly as fights go longer so they might go oom. Planned on rolling horde side warrior but now I'll have to think again. Was already also thinking about rogue.
---
The early raids will still be trivialized.  Remember, we're still running 1.12.  This means the best talents, easier tanking than pre 1.11, and the best gear.
---
Don't get me wrong, MC and BWL and even AQ40 were never "hard".  But they will get cleared faster and easier.
---
Or you type /ty but the monster you're fighting is still selected... /embarrassed
---
I said "overly substantial" i.e. it won't kill you to play a caster of another race in pve, but you will be at a dps loss in comparison to the racial. 
---
While the racial is an asset, I personally don't feel non-troll casters are gimped in comparison to troll casters. You are of course free to disagree.
---
lmao okay
---
Are you seriously downvoting me for this? typical rogue player, gl finding a guild that'll keep you
---
40% not 50
---
Just a random choice.  Just wanted a buffer thinking it might help with frame clipping or whatever it's called. My PC can put out like 300 on wow, so 60 vs 100 isn't big. Never hear the thing spin up.

It was purely a convenience thing on his end. He told me “go here, install this, type this shit in this box, join this channel, now talk over the computer instead of typing”
---
Not in vanilla you can't, that was changed quite a bit later.
---
He's one of the devs of classic and mostly the one who made it possible.
---
He locked himself for weeks trying to find a way to make it technicaly possible and succeeded
---
do we know if rolling ignites are in? oh god.
---
I love how that final fight is such a gigantic mess that there was no normal tank healer structure while doing it (at least not in the group I was).
---
How about set bonuses that cater to alternate play styles. So there is a set bonus that gives mana regen when you crit with wrath for boomkins in whatever new content they come up with. I don’t agree with fundamental class changes, but items can fix it.
---
&gt;So it takes 2 hours
---
No the whole chain will take a lot longer than 2 hours. I would know, I did it recently on a pserver. I won't ever do it again. If I level another pally, I will skip wasting the time going all over the place, and instead buy something cheap like [Bloodpike](http://classicdb.ch/?item=13057) at lvl 23 which will last until [Cobalt Crusher](http://classicdb.ch/?item=7730) at lvl 29. Like I've said before, the SFK portion of this quest is the only thing that makes the questline not worth doing. If you have a higher level friend willing to help you get the item from SFK, then it's worth doing. I did all of the stages up to SFK fairly easy and quickly. Finding a group for the elite Loch Modan ogres or the Deadmines is not particularly hard, but finding a group for SFK is a waste of time.
---
&gt; 3-4 other pallys from about 18-20 
---
The quest req is level 20, so you would be looking for paladins lvl 20-25. A lot of them may have already done the quest, or they don't have the time to run to SFK, or they are on a different stage of the quest. The Westfall stage when you have to defend against the Defias attack is a pain in the ass at level 20, you need at least 2 people to do that.
---
&gt;the best weapon for 8 levels
---
Strike of the Hydra at level 26 is better. Also you would get to level 21 before finishing the quest. 
---
Having a good weapon thru these levels isn't even really important because leveling up to 30 is so quick. Whirlwind weapons last until [Bonebiter](http://classicdb.ch/?item=6830) the SM quest axe reward at around level 40. Going from level 31-40 takes a lot more time than going from level 21 to 29. Whirlwind weapons last for a long time because they have good itemization (str and stam) unlike Verigan's Fist which has its itemization wasted on int and spirit.
---
Team of 3 min mages would wipe the floor. They could just kill the whole other team instantly. Pre-BC had a lot more burst than BC. BC intently added in a stat to counter that burst.
---
People could go after him the same way he got up there though.
---
As s tank I won't put my healer in this position intentionally.

---
You're saying all those things like orcs and metal music was "cool" back then. 
---
12 year olds aren't cool. They're lame. They liked LOTR but wanted to be legolas so they roll NE hunters. 12 year olds don't want to be the bad guys minions. I think once they get to high school though is when horde was more the choice. Both super young immature age groups but I think Alliance was younger feeling. However the Horde might have been more annoying due to being teenagers and bold with trolling and shit. 
---
I also thought of Alliance as the hardcore adult gamers that really did the math and stuff and Horde was just the stoners and shit who wanted to be badass. That's why Alliance seemed to raid better but Horde did better in BG's (on my server at least, sounds like a common thing though).
---
&gt; They've specifically said it's meant to address the large populations cohabiting what will be a handful of zones at launch. That stresses the servers like crazy so it's either sharding/layering or open a ton of realms. 
---
That would make sense except for the fact that layering affects the whole continent not just the zones with too many people.  
---
It seems to me that it's specifically so they can have a lot more people on each server not just in the zones.  The spread out thing as I understood it was when their proposed solution was sharding, not layering.
---
I'm not sure how they'll get rid of layering if there's still like 5000-8000 people active on a server at the end of phase one.

I was leveling in Deathknell when the server broadcast came out about the faction leader events. So at level 3 I hoofed it to the zepplins and headed to Orgrimmar. All the guards outside Deathknell were Hoggers, and so were the Zep guards. I was using my imp to throw down his life for me so I could get past the Hoggers (I'll never forget you, Volkin). Super fun end to the stress test.

I never downvoted you, dude.

Original wow dev, mocked up the classic db working with new client as a proof of concept. Other decs probably would have figured it out, but his knowledge of the structure probably helped greatly speed up the POC.
---
Ahhh. A legend, then. Thank you for the explanation.
---
He was a wow dev long before twitch was a thing.
---
I copied this comment over from another post I made today, but it kind of captures what your looking for, the difference between wotlk, and vanilla.
---
One thing you will REALLY dislike about vanilla is you will need to devote some time to PVE content if you want the “optimal” gear to pvp. (Dungeons, raids etc) 
---
Transmogrification - The sense of building your character and each peace of tier gear meaning something and feeling closer to completing a set. Plus it lets gauge how much of a badass someone is by an eye shot. If you see some in full T3 + a Thunderfury, you know they're one badass mofo
---
No flying mounts - While a convenient mode of transportation, a key feature of classic world of Warcraft is making the world feel massive and alive. That can only occur if you see other people moving throughout the world. This best occurs with a thriving trade district, and people moving zone to zone on their mounts, or by walking, as opposed to flying 1000 ft in the air flying over everything. It adds a new axis to the dynamic, so instead of just an x and y axis, we now have a x, y, z axis making things feel smaller in comparison. This also helps create a thriving world pvp environment by forcing players of opposite factions to interact. There were some pretty large battles that took place inside blackrock mountain back in the day, which are all the more costly due to world buffs and their impact.
---
AoE looting - Killing an enemy of the same level in WoW can be challenging depending on class, even more so when they have fleeing mechanics, many times they'll die near other mobs. With an AoE loot mechanic you don't have to weigh the cost of aggroing other mobs to potentially loot a mob.
---
Sharding /Cross realm - The key feature of vanilla was grouping with other players. Early on alliance have the infamous hogger quest. I was recently playing on a private server, grouped up with a paladin, mage, and me (warrior) and killed Hogger. When I was about level 20 I was looking for a healer and dps for deadmines. Ended up grouping up with the exact same paladin and mage that I did hogger with - in short this fosters a sense of community.
---
Dual Spec - At its core vanilla is a true RPG game. RPG's come with stat building and choices. With these choices come with consequences. If you want to play an arms warrior for example, you are forgoing to the opportunity to main tank raids, and vice versa (without excessive gold farming). It's this kind of play style that makes vanilla more of a classic rpg where it forces you into picking a role and sticking to it.
---
Raid/Group finder - Destroys the community and socialization aspect. I haven't experienced it first hand, but in retail I've heard people don't even talk in party chat any more. During my private server experiences, we're always joking, communicating, talking etc.  
---
One other thing - There is no greater feeling than slapping on that first pair of grey shoulder pads that you find on a level 14-20 mob.
---
He's not lying. Just like any other 'minion' or 'vehicle' you control in WoW, there's lag when you dismiss them, so they remain friendly for something like half a second, where you have control of your character again, leading to you being able to get 1 buff off, before they turn hostile again.
---
he's not right, but neither are you with that logical fallacy
---
My main (and only) character that I play is a lock. It’s just habit for me to do this. I’ve done it practically since I started. I’ll even give UB to the bg group while we wait for the countdown. It’s nice to do in retail since it gives a little swim speed increase. 
---
I can’t wait to have random people running by giving me fort and AI again. No one does it anymore ☹️
---
the BETA is getting more attention than retail has in years. Classic, people going super hard and a c t u a l l y trying, races to 60, its going to be the biggest section of twitch for weeks.
---
I don’t understand why? A lot of the streamers are putting out good content and even if you are upset with it, here is a streamer with a much different approach. Talking a lot about the development from his time as a lead dev for vanilla. You are getting content and explanations into the overall design of the game we are all excited about.
---
Or is this the standard omg streamers are ruining our game and holding us hostage bs?
---
Two?  
---
Warlock main. Herbalism + Skinning while leveling. Drop Skinning for Tailoring at 60. Craft Robe of the Void, then drop Tailoring for Alchemy.
---
Nostalgia will hit me the most at Theramore, and Gadgetzan.
---
Yeah that would have been cool too.  
---
I wished we got the actual draenei in TBC rather than the retconned "Space Goat" draenei which looked nothing like actual draenei.  Even if everything else was the same (other than the exodarr) it would have been cool to have an "ugly" race alliance side.
---
I logged out on this dam there night before cata. Pretty much broke my ability to log in lmao. Great screenshot!
---
Spell wise you should keybind everything you use.
---
I only click things like hearthstone and certain consumables.
---
And so it was that Omar locked himself for a fortnight within the Chamber of Enlightenment. When he emerged he ushered unto us the path to purity.
---
I feel like back then the common theory was that Tauren were the best warriors because of the health and AOE stun. That was my belief at least.
---
Number one fish bot site
---
yes. but most guilds dont have the dmg to even require anything past a prot warrior tank the threat loss of like 9% isnt going to change much
---
While Classic will be a huge success, I find it incredibly asinine to think that, overall, there would be more interest in Classic than Retail. Of course the classicwow subreddit would think that but we are, realistically, a small fraction of the population.
---
Hey, I see myself! Hi me!
---
ALL HAIL ZP, HORDE SAVIOR
---
It was changed in Wrath where you could use it in combat. The trade off was that they took away your ability to eat/drink while in Shadowmeld.
---
I quite like how it works in vanilla. Being able to to eat/drink safely on a PvP server is amazing.
---
Layering is for onions and hamburgers.
---
Transmogs are account-wide in retail and so a level 12 warrior could indeed deck them self out in faux-Dreadnaught if the account has it unlocked.
---
That is nothing short of absolutely awesome! I missed that last night 😕
---
The community definitely got worse in TBC. Nobody can deny this.
---
Alliance with friends.

May I suggest you level each to e.g. 10-15 ish and see which clicks? We can talk to you about our experiences, and you can read up on each class/their talents/etc but picking a class is very personality dependent and sometimes they just "click."
---
How come you chose this over Big Five?

Love this idea. No resilience, no flying mounts. Perfect.

---
Well warlock and warrior are probably the most different - do you have any interest in tanking? Do you enjoy using pets?
---
Are you trying to raid primarily? Pvp?
---
A lot of questions need to be answered in order to figure it out.
---
I guess I meant, is it hard to avoid dying when it's not gonna save time.
---
TBH this is actually a good thing. I remember back in Vanilla how me and my horde bros were convinced Blizz hated horde and only liked Ally. Ally also had like 3 to 1 (Ally to Horde) numbers on a lot of servers. 
---
It really gave me a deep-seated hatred for Ally to the point of me almost never touching Ally at all in the entire time I've played WoW (up to TBC + the Past 3 expacs, missed Wrath, Cata, MOP). I can't explain it its just something that grew in me in Vanilla and TBC (to some extent). I've always felt weird seeing Horde being the popular faction on retail. I miss being the big scary beast underdog Horde.
---
This is bringing that back.
---
That's one reason.
---
Hotkey every ability, and your rotationally important weapons/shields/trinkets/potions/elixirs/items. You can click whatever else to your hearts content. Just know that as a Warrior you probably have more keybinds than any other classes besides maybe Druid or Warlocks.

its not that simple. bubble, fire reflector, ice block etc + it's extremely easy to kill a 3 min mage as they have no ice barrier or ice block.
---
As far as I know as a non-tester they haven't spawned any (or just significantly less) raid bosses in Horde areas but we've seen Rag, Ony, Patchwerk and others in Ally areas.
---
But they are rewarded for that work by receiving a piece of loot over other playerd
---
Just look at how fuxking smooth this is running. Vanilla Brain fucking activated.
---
Valid point!
---
Plenty of comedy though!
---
I'm on 2560x1440p 144hz with all the settings maxed and it was beautiful. What's even more beautiful is the performance and consistency of my framerate.
---
I do have somewhat of a BiS rig
---
You can hit 1 thing from futher away and can get hit by 10 things from futher away. If anything, it's a disadvantage
---
Someone has to prove their opinion has value for people to value it
---
If you tell someone gravity isn't real they would want to know your qualifications as a physicist, why would it be any different in business?
---
I was Guybrush the wannabe pirate.
---
what, of course you could solo content that was 4 expansions prior to current content. Unless you mean trying to show off hard stuff to get that you got back in the day wouldn't be possible because anyone could just go get it any time and nobody would know better.  
---
Even still that doesn't mean transmog is bad, that literally has nothing to do with transmog, that's just powerscaling through expansions, whether transmog was in the game or not during MoP seeing someone decked out in vanilla gear still wouldn't be impressive because like you said it's easily soloable.  
---
But that's how it works, something that was impressive 15 years ago isn't going to remain impressive for the entirety of the games life, it's replaced by new impressive things such as challenge mode gear, or the mage tower stuff from Legion.
---

Alright so I was off and confused as well. It’s .08% per point in 5 different areas. So with 5 skill it’s .4% in 5 different areas totaling 2% reduction in miss chance.
---
.08% chance to hit, dodge, parry, block, crit. Combine all 5 for .4% chance per skill point. 5 skill points for 2%.
---
That's right we don't want Beta server sceenshots.

not as viable as hunter. But it can be good if you have enough gear to bear tank things down. you also have the option of finding 1 other druid and doing stealth runs.

The smoothness really is something else. It's like running a 15 year old game on modern technology. Very impressed throughout the whole ritual.

Never played WoW before pleb here - what exactly was this event?
---
gotem
---
Oh thanks, didnt know cuz the private server client doesn't have it
---
I get where I am off now. I was just talking hit. Like hit alone, which would mean I was off by 50% I forgot that it also changes other things on the hit table.
---
So it’s .08% for hit, block, dodge, parry and crit. Totaling to .4% per point in miss reduction and 2% for 5 points. What was throwing me off when looking at the table was I was just looking at hit. Not miss rate and not the increase elsewhere.
---
I was forgetting all the math involved.
---
Excellent guide, saving this and I really appreciate all the work you put into this.  This sub needs more of this.
---
you can just run far out of the fight and drop combat sometimes in vanilla
---
F-word i forgot about this .... ahhhh it looks so lame now and as flashy as the new ones but oh my god it felt so epic .... back then
---
You can hit 1 thing from futher away and get hit by other 10 things from futher away. If anything it's a disadvantage
---
Jesus Christ I missed it again...

I don't know the numbers but how is old school RuneScape doing compared to the normal cersion

You hit this one right on this is the answer I was looking for. Will there still be heirloom items for the next character you want to level?

Omar spawned ! (Blizzard Dev)
---
Went for a swim, or as a "swan dive" as Omar calls it.
---
Then we chilled a bit at the entrance.
---
Lot's of adventurers.
---
Eagle's eye view.
---
Omar kept on getting taller it seems.
---
Dancing n'stuff.
---
Thrall undercover as Hogger.
---
MORE DOTS !
---
We decided to kite him to Goldshire for more help from the guards there.
---
Then we regretted and just took him back.
---
Chain lightning anyone ?
---
Patchwerk came as an ally. Also more Throggers spawned.
---
No more play ? Patchwerk went enrage mode and cleaned up for us.
---
Hello darkness my old friend. Look who spawned.
---
Mistakes were made.
---
Run when you can, walk if you have to, crawl if you must, just never give up.
---
Forgot my frost res gear in my bank :(
---
Gang of VanCleefs spawned !
---
Kiss of the Spider didn't drop.
---
**Featuring:**
---
*Omar Gonzalez*
---
*Thrall (disguised as Hogger)*
---
*Patchwerk (as an ally)*
---
*C'thun and his tentacles.*
---
*Sapphiron*
---
*Edwin VanCleef(s)*
---
*Maexxna*

Seeing it in person through your computer screen is nothing like actually being there I  person in real life.
---
If anyone has any delusion that "bis only" culture isn't coming to classic, think again.
---
Played u like a fiddle
---
Seems about right with my memory of vanilla..
---
Although Im an Aussie and 300ms may have played a big role in that 😂
---
scholo had great easter eggs about that one family whose name i forgot. You had to have the orb of caer darrow or something to get the quest but it was a really good lesser known quest line
---
It was easier for me to categorize with Myers-Briggs
---
“You think you do, but our shareholders don’t”
---
Make the game HARD? BC was *much* harder than Vanilla... If hard is what you’re looking for, BC will satisfy that. If the downsides of BC aren’t worth the positives, Classic is there for you.
---
Running from Sentinel Hill to SW is faster when you run to Hogger and die there, rez N of Goldshire, and then run north.
---
In this route, there are no accident deaths.
---
There are 2 spots where if you DON'T die when expected, you can get a bonus 70xp or so getting an extra exploration point, but those are labeled and organized as bonus anyways.
---
So if you die, you're good. If you get lucky for an extra 30 seconds, free bonus.
---
Not in the traditional sense of 10% exp boost with stats that increase as you level;however, there were heirlooms in vanilla that do exist
---
E.g. you can take a skinning knife and enchant it with +30 spell power and give it to a caster call to make it a bis weapon all the way to 60.
---
This was so beautiful to be a part of.
---
Totally. Him and MadSeason streaming having really stemmed the pain of not having beta!
---
He was inside you the whole time!
---
I'll go. I have it narrowed down between Druid, Paladin, Shaman, and Warlock.
---
I want to have a spot in raids, be able to farm gold effectively, and be able to do well in BG's as DPS. I also don't want to respec very often. I would also prefer to heal for raids.
---
I'm not really sure if there is even a class that hits all those wants for me. Warlock is probably closest since it can do everything except heal. I would really prefer to heal in raids over dpsing though.
---
It was a pretty big problem even in tbc.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zANeJ_lCSXc
---
I personally see it as a mixed bag regarding if it’s a benefit or not. It comes down the class. For a hunter this maybe an issue (not sure if this effects dead zone or not) whereas for a warrior (the theoretical king of melee) it can be advantageous. Sure your hit box is larger but that’s fine! If your in range and can be hit that enemy is in the pain zone!
---
i just bind bloodthirst, whirlwind and heroic strike to my keyboard over several buttons and roll my face across the keyboard. But really..everything except Mocking blow it looks like. 
---

---
Ive got a different mouse setup now so ill probaly bind cleave and heroic strike to scroll up / down and more buttons to mouse.
---
Yes you are probably correct that Prot Warrior will probably be optimal in Classic, it is just kind of funny seeing some posters (not your post) acting like anything other than Prot Tanks are going to be instantly one shot when the only actual ability that you want from going Deep Prot is Shield Slam (which was useless for 90% of the game), and had to have Prot completely revamped in TBC.
---
Jenga, obviously...
---
Tauren is great, Trolls are also great, and then you have the awesome ass Undead, but then there is the Orcs, who are pretty great
---
oops
---
I remember just keeping a half bag full of food and it was never an issue
---
I understand what you are saying, but at the same time... I don't think it's outside the realm of possibility. Gamers are extremely influential. Look how quickly Fortnite was able to take over PUBG. Streamers, friends, and the media could significantly shift populations between Retail and Classic.
---
Again... this may be unlikely, but still very possible.
---
Vanilla was all about BiS as well fren
---
So according to data from beta provided by u/ohganot for 300-305 it is .08% per point in hit, block, dodge, parry, and crit. .04% after. Which means for 300-305 it’s 2% total reduction in miss rate and .4% in each of the 5 areas.
---
Yeah that's true a big part of it was poor (okay craptacular) itemization for the alternate playstyles but certain abilities were terrible to use because of how poor they scaled or impossible to get(arcane shot scaling with spell power when the only spell power you could get was t2.5 out of AQ40) while I love the idea of bowcasters stacking spell power to make it useful it really gimped them in everything else
---
If you're a pally definitely keybind your hearthstone though.
---
PW: Fort is not worth farming another soul shard /s
---
I would say in priority order :
---
1 Sunder Armor
---
2 Faerie Fire
---
3 Curse of elements
---
4 Curse of shadows
---
5 Shadow Weaving 
---
6 Curse of Recklesness
---
7 Winter's Chill/Improved scorch
---
8 Nightfall
---
9 Improved Shadow Bolt
---
10 Hunter's mark, in early tiers
---
Then if needed damage reduction effects : Curse of weakness/Demo shout
---
After that dot effects.
---
The best probably is Corruption, mostly in SM spec.
---
And then Fire mage ignite, followed by deep wounds, mind flay, shadow pain
---
Feeding your pets is really no big deal unless you are using a per that is a picky eater.. Go with something like a boar, they ear literally everything and you collect plenty just questing and killing things. I am using a boar on beta and am constantly feeding him boar body parts lol.
---
Keeping track of arrows and missing out on sn entire bag slot due to your quiver is far more annoying than feeding your pet.
---
Did it titanforge to an 8-slotter!?!?
---
It's like the most well known banning of anyone ever in wow.  
---
Ensidia? You know the top guild for years?
---
being there in person in real life ehhhh?
---
Thanks for the reply
---
Imagine thinking he would've seen this without Esfands stream.
---
Mage: tailoring is essential for BIS robe.
---
So I don’t have any vanilla theorycrafting but I do have something from the beta.
---
[According](https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/issues/5) to data collected in beta. From 300-305 it’s .08% to hit, block, dodge, parry and crit. Totaling 2% total reduction of miss rate for 5 skill points with .4% for each of the 5 areas.
---
There should be an argument you can type after the emote to make it select no target. Idk if there is, but we need it.  /ty null
---
People ITT and elsewhere circlejerking threat. Has no one considered how much harder it will be for tanks to just **survive** with this? "It's just 9%". Nah dawg, nah. It's **180%** more parries. It's nearly three times as many parries. Tanks will be taking a shitload more damage.
---
I have vanilla expertise and experience in rogue, mage, and warrior, in that order. TBC experience extends to resto druid, but didn't find that fun. TBC I also built two more rogues. I made rogue #4 in WotLK (along with a DK, barf).
---
I'm thinking about making a rogue, but since I'll be more casual, I don't know if it's worth the struggle to find groups and get gear. Meanwhile as a warrior, I can control 5 mans, most 10 man, and I've only got like 4 items I'd need to spend DKP in phase one. But also, mage and rogue are easier to make money on. Also, I miss Ravenholdt Manor.
---
What does the subreddit think?
---
I never got too high during vanilla, not entirely sure what this means for me :/
---
To be honest, while Pvping as a Warrior, I'm not super worried about things being close enough to hit me. I'm more worried about **not** being in range of someone else. If theres a race that will allow me to hit someone from further away while I'm CC'ed or gives me a few extra yards of reach to get a imp hamstring proc off, I'm gonna pick that race.
---
I will roll NE HUNTER as main , with skinning and leatherworking as profession..  Skin can be vendored or sold to AH. (NE's Shadow meld can help a bit if you leveling on pvp server)
---
but 
---
i will supplement my main's profession with my secondary and tertiary main.
---
so i will roll HUMAN WARLOCK secondary main with Tailoring + Enchanting , to create Lesser Magic Wand and Greater Magic wand which is rather powerful at low levels (below 25) .. the Free lv40 mount helps a lot
---
then i will roll a tertiary main which is NE DRUID , as some ppl here suggested it is a perfect solo leveling class as it can Stealth , Tank , DPS , Heal all in one package.. This will be Herbalist + Alchemist
---
for Alts i will roll
---
HUMAN Paladin (i hate dwarf's physical form) with Mining and Blacksmith (some ppl told me to roll mining and engineer for paladin)
---
HUMAN Mage (i hate gnome's shape) with Mining + Herbalism (or engineer)
---
i heard Warrior and Rogue are the slowest leveler and most boring to level so i will skip on them
---
I think people just dont welcome retail players trying to turn classic into retail. otherwise people have been very welcoming
---
it sort of a catch-22. ya I care about community - so I don't want people who prioritize their 'epic lootz' over everything else to be part of the community. Its kind of like the paradox of tolerance.
---
Ya'll just didnt summon hard enough.
---
changed back to vanilla reqs? lvl 10 and 10s?
---
That’s amazing! It all makes sense now
---
Depends on the circumstance. If you two are waiting on a named quest objective mob, there’s no need for a chat beforehand. You both know what it’s for. Talking rude about not getting an invite, it’s also rude to try and hog a mob that can have a 5-10minute respawn.
---
Responding to rudeness with jackassery makes you no better.
---
yep and I rather than then layering.
---
That staff literally had 8 AGI on it.  I gave hunters "of the monkey" greens with better stats during raids to use instead of that staff. 
---
They weren't appreciative for some reason.
---
Esfand and Omar have a rapport. I'm not surprised.
---
once you lvl up loyalty thing  just feeding it when the lil icon changes is all u need . for new pets i feed them often for the first lvl or 2 of loyalty
---
wasn't like that back in WoD and Legion when they added mythic. the sets had a lot more detaisl and effect. Uldir and Dazalor are poor examples but since they dropped tier sets it's not surprising. Regardless ,even if they are recolors, that's still a good difference and still tells people how far you'\ve gone.
---
Yep, the phase 1 only argument is null and void until Blizz provides details on what they'll do for this situation.
---
Ele/resto shaman?
---
Boars eat boar meat. :O
---
what do you mean 'unpublished stories' ?
---
Yeah it’s interestibg, in vanilla it’s all we had, it was the casual mmo. Some people who poured 100 days into the game hated leveling. 
---
The game only got more popular through the first 3 expansions. Clearly there is a middle ground between vanilla and wrath (cough bc cough) that is the ideal mix of old mmo grinding, time investment, instant gratification and game skills.
---
I think people who play bfa and gamers  in general today are averse to grinding and at times time investment. 
---
I see classic at around 250,000-500,000 long term for the first two years. No idea how many will stick around to play vanilla a 2nd or 3rd time (depending if you played OG vanilla)—I won’t be. 
---
Werent there like 800,000 level 60s when the bc pre patch hit?
---
Should you read up on those guides? Yeah, sure. It's good to know what bonuses exist and where they come from. Knowledge is always good. 
---
Should you *follow* those guides to the letter? Nah, not unless you want to. Racial bonuses in most case are fairly minor, and no one can see your talent points for the most part. Unless you're actively hindering the raid, the best thing you can be is cooperative and reliable, so the best thing you can do is play the character that you *want* to play.
---
If it's worth to you that much, do it. It's personal preference and the game isn't supposed to be balanced
---
The dev who figured out how to make classic work again.
---
*Dad what are they talking about* 
---
*Shhh just pretend it’s tv.* 
---
*Grabs popcorn*
---
That’s great. I guess he really was the one who made it happen.
---
&gt; I wonder what the game would have been like had they made different choices on some things. 
---
That's why I want future classic content instead of the same expansions we had in the past.
---
lmao so he is, oops. I forgot about the "party" of NPCs you rescue from the cages
---
Anybody who cares more about the appearance of leg armour or boots than a fucking dope Naga tail is out of their mind. I'd love to slither around Azeroth.
---
Buccaneers vs booty Bay
---
Gonna sounds like a total noob, but... BiS?
---
This echoes my thoughts and experience as well. Didn't make a lice toon until BFA.
---
I’m gonna mirror other people with a “props” for effort and ideas. I just don’t think Vanilla has *room* for all this. It would be such a cluttered game. Also, most of the old content would easily be found obsolete. What if iconic ZG got replaced by a modern designed raid that’s designed with little creativity and tacky themes? I would probably unsub at some point when the old game is no longer recognizable in the sea of content.
---
IMO, Classic has 1 10 man, 1 20 man, and 2-3 dungeons it can fit in without diluting the experience that the original devs had in mind. 
---
Also, side note on Kara... personally, I would hate clearing a “brand new” rehash of an old raid. I’d rather do Kara the way it was designed, at 70... unless it’s the unseen alpha model of Kara, then it’s some brand new experience and I’m down.
---
Hell yeah got the same monitor setup and this looks soo buttery smooth. Can’t flippin wait.
---
hahaha "It's a blue, my shoulders are green, ergo- an upgrade"
---
I once saw something describing each personality type and for INFP they just put WoW ;)
---
Forsaken should have been their own faction with human ud, dwarf ud and elf undead.
---
most of these '12 year olds' back then prefer to play scary looking tough horde characters , and older people usually prefer human (normal) looking avatars..
---
are you basing all your conclusion from stress test ? if so then your data points are lacking
---
Content will be released in timed phases. The only things releasing as is from 1.12 will be class balance and loot being in their final 1.12 itemization form.
---
Found dumbass's brother too
---
So he is single handedly responsible for making this all happen. I shall follow this glorious man.
---
Wait, what exactly would you call draeni if not ugly?
---
Tanks also take more damage.  See skarms video in this
---
Realms with shared player-names that can spin up or down dynamically
---
Whoa, settle down.
---
Omar is the guy that, long story short, gave us classic wow. Hes all over google im sure.
---
It's real hard to dps and heal without respecing. Closest is shadow priest but a raid slot might be hard to come by. Power infusion priest might work but you don't deal tons of damage in pvp.
---
I will be reliving my first mage journey through vanilla so tailoring / enchanting it is
---
Your words upset me :(
---
And they are purely temporary until server populations even out and the early zones are not as crowded.
---
While I do agree, I don’t think it’s the actual content people crave, it’s the sense of community, sense of reward, no item/currency inflation, everything seems rewarding, you’re more likely to encounter players in the world, and the ability to become famous/infamous within your community.
---
MMO’s tend to feel a lot less “massive” the bigger they get, that’s just my opinion. 
---
The players can make or break a game. 
---
I’ve spent the last 10 months on another MMO, being back for a week it’s become obvious the current model has spoiled the average player.
---
\&gt; I started playing late WotLK.   
---
lol good troll. so you have no frame of reference but you're sure these things are QoL improvements? stay on retail then.   
---
supremely selfish to demand that shit be in both games when its so divisive
---
TBC improved on classes so much than it is hard for me to consider vanilla better.  I was also very much enjoying the harder content the expansion had to offer in the forms of 5 mans and the raids.  
---
The only downsides were the lack of world pvp happening much (still did, but not too frequently), a new hub that had most people spending time in outlands rather than the rest of the world, and some of the new catch up philosophies that showed up in the second half were a bit overbearing. 
---
If I had my choice, it would be straight to TBC, but I understand why vanilla is so wanted as a starting point.
---
You can cast an instant spell like fort or renew or shield, which would break MC, but the target was friendly at the time of casting and would receive the spell.
---
Wow was going to be a uni faction game for a long time. Then Dark Age of Camelot came out and Alan Adham put his foot down and said there will be pvp there will be two factions.
---
Thank you
---
&gt; But you could go out and grind reputation to make enemy factions think “hey, maybe this evil lizard-thing really isn’t that bad.”
---
c-2-3 c-2-3 c-2-3 c-2-3 c-2-3 c-2-3 c-2-3 c-2-3 c-2-3 c-2-3

Sorry, Privateer flashbacks
---
Horde for life
---
But humans didn't come from monkeys either lol (common ancestor and all), but I get what you're saying. Just seems kinda weird to say that Trolls look too much like Night Elves, when Night Elves are literally evolved Trolls.
---
If you ever wonder what took Blizzard so long to bring Classic, just look at some of the comments here.
---
Omar has to be feeling pretty good about the near godhood he's got going on with classic wow right now.
---
Where my other 4 ESTJ Hunters at
---
They did not guarantee only a few weeks, so it's a moot argument. They only said done by phase 2. And even then...they haven't stated what they'd do at phase 2 if pop is still a problem... so basically the whole thing is unacceptable at the moment. 
---
I'm fine with the need for a solution, but I deal in logic and facts. They haven't presented a full solution.
---
It was possible but very few people knew about this/did this in vanilla. This was super prevalent for a time in BC. You could go behind the Alliance side flag room as well, and even if you also knew the exploit its difficult to kill the flag carrier because they could just jump through the wall, head to tunnel, and start the whole process again. 
---
I think there were a few other spots like the giant stump on the side of the map.
---
It's not so much 'burnout' as it is convenience.  If it's more convenient and efficient to ask people around you for help, to add them to your friends list, and to call on them later when you want to group... then that's what players will do.  But if it's more convenient to solo whatever you were trying to do or to instantly get a group of anonymous players through a cross-realm group finder teleport service, then players will do that instead.
---
it will just be gank central from the rest of the server
---
Im on board for doing the OSRS way of things, update the game to its pre-TBC patch, then poll the players for future update considerations that fit in with the core vanilla game philosophy.
---
Most important thing relating to that: the happiness meter is right next to the pet frame (some addons have it replace the pet's health bar color). The green "happy" icon in the pet information window is always green and only serves to know a pet's diet.
---
its wild
---
what is your point EXACTLY ?
---
Looks like Blizzcon 2018
---
Like 4-5 times I think better?
---
But you gotta know this to, Old School Runescape was dying until they made........ CHANGES! (Dun, Dun, DUN!)
---
That is what they claim, but it is under the assumption that the playerbase will plummet in about a month.  
---
What if the game only experiences slow growth for a couple years rather than drops people more than it gains?  Then layering will stay.
---
Are you retarded? The whole fucking point of my post is to say “I have no experience with how the game was before these changes. I hear it was good. I want to be convinced of of that... cause I believe you” You’d have to be absolutely fucking stupid to think I said I want these changes in Classic. Jesus.
---
each boss has unique resist table, Blizzard confirmed this, same with armor
---
If the change was made in or before 1.12, then it will be after the change.
---
Yeah if it was a bannable offense back in vanilla, I have no issue with them removing it
---
SM/Ruin lock covers everything here but healing.
---
stop reposting twitch stream here
---
Nope, those are the ZG set shoulders. A lot of hunter wore them back then before we knew that TS were essentially better.
---
Super hardcore shit is fine. We just need modern systems for making groups.
---
The current dungeon finder in wow (not lfd) is great, and I wouldn’t be opposed to it being added to a classic+ server when aq war effort starts.
---
Aiming an emote at yourself is the same as doing it with no target
---
yeah, it's more like "there's things that are in blizzard's control, there's things that are in your control, and there's nebulous things outside of anyone's control"
---
recognizing what we personally control in that is our greatest power
---
war stomp is incredible for shaman and actually is a realistic choice over orc
---
Pet wasn’t too bad. Ammo was my biggest pain. Usually all our hunters had more arrows than what could fit in a quiver for long raids. Giving up a bag slot plus a few more bag spots was annoying. Then again I feel most classes have some annoyance to deal with so not a huge deal.
---
I think you will enjoy both pvp and pve with a hunter. Good hunters can take on multiple enemies at once using traps and kiting skills and it’s crazy fun.
---
All three ranks
---
Isnt' this copy paste from the WOW forum ?
---
Org has an arena.
---
Except for the fact that all of these optimal specs are based around now proven incorrect values on pservers. 
---
The meta is likely to change and it sounds like you're going to be the one everyone laughs at for using crappy pserver specs.
---
Yeah not 100 percent tho

Alliance tanks don't hit from the front?

The first time I heard about WoW was in a video game magazine my roommate showed me...he said “it’s warcraft but like you can walk around”...i replied “that could be cool i guess”...2 years later i was fully addicted.  And now 15 years later i’m dying for classic to release.
---
It sounds like you're really leaning toward rogue. If you're looking to play casually and aren't worried about raid spots outside of pugs, they're a great class for solo play. 
---
You can pick and choose every fight in wpvp and if you spec imp sap finding a group isn't as difficult as you'd think.
---
Isn't phase 1 going to last months though?  Why would they end a phase before the average player even hits 60?
---
this is not wallwalking. that is a different technique. many people don't understand the nuances unless they were into exploring etc.
---
you can't nerf every way to navigate terrain like this, it makes the game anti-fun. you won't be able to climb mountains or even small geometry in the world which is very important in a game without flying mounts.
---
I see PlatinumWoW, I upvote. Simple as that. Dude is hilarious.
---
it does virtually nothing to average players, only the top end guilds will be affected much at all, shitty casual guilds aren't going to be threat capped
---
True, IoQD was pretty great. I have no problem with not seeing end game raid content, it's aspirational content. Knowing that there is more stuff to the world that you might never see simply because you aren't good enough to get there is a GOOD thing for the game. It makes the world feel larger, more dangerous and more wondrous. I'd definitely be against nerfing raid content.
---
I do wish that end-game Vanilla epics had stayed relavent for longer though, and that BC had better continued the trend of "weird AF itemisation". Weird itemisation was great, it made strange builds possible (even if they were far from optimal) and created this interesting market of sidegrades for players who weren't rocking BiS (the vast majority.)
---
And I too played a Warlock. Honestly, HS Wells were convenient, but BC included the best QoL feature Warlocks ever got, and the only one they ever needed: soul shards no longer disappeared if logged out for 15 minutes.
---
They did change levelling speed though. IIRC they didn't change the total XP requirements, but they significantly increased the XP rewards of all pre-TBC quests (and dungeons I think, but I might be wrong there. It wasn't as much as WotLK though.)
---
I know 5 mages with pom pyro that say otherwise.
---
Oh I was making a for the horde joke
---
Can’t wait!
---
There is no solution.  This is basically just a PR game at this point.  
---
The way this is being handled, is basically causing many players to hope the game loses enough players so that this feature is removed, and diminished excitement for a lasting growth, because a lasting growth means layering will never go away.
---
There is no solution to this other than the original sharding plan, which is far worse.  Sadly... I doubt most are surprised that a corporation prefers cost cutting over consumer happiness.
---
I'm sorry :(
---
This was the place I honed my abilities as a 5 man paladin tank and thought it meant I could tank raids later. Paladin aoe agro. I handled those stairs in my level 40s when people wanted level 50 for that dungeon. hah!
---
25% stunresist is far better than a situational warstomp that you might not be in range to use in a battleground
---
My only two 60s during vanilla were both druids. One nelf one tauren.
---
i see this subreddit become advertisement board for streamers and youtubers..
---
Humans are literally evolved monkeys.
---
And when you get a group together you all buff each other up and become exponentially more powerful!!!
---
Slam, I think? I dont remember using that much at all as a DW fury.
---
It wont be harder at all if the damage from raid bosses is lower than it is on private servers. I have no idea why everyone came to this conclusion like if parry chance is the determining factor of how hard a boss is going to be. 
---
Boss damage, armor, healthpool and abilities is more important. If these are nerfed compared to ps parry wont matter.

What do we say to the stormwind sewer beast? Not today.
---
On my Rogue (main), I'll be going Mining and Skinning the first chance I get.
---
When my Mining starts to slack because I'm not going out of my way to keep it up, I'll drop it for Enchanting. I suspect this to happen around level 40, but it could be earlier.
---
I won't be leveling Enchanting, just using it DE quest rewards (except weapons, those I'll vendor).
---
After I hit 60, I'll pick up Mining again.
---
After I have all the materials to level Engineering, I'll drop Skinning to pick it up.
---
All of my alts will follow the same principle.
---
My Mage, Priest, and Warlock will do Herb-&gt;Enchanting-&gt;Herb along with early Tailoring so they can churn out Mooncloth starting at level 35. The Mage and Priest will drop Herbalism for Alchemy for the Transmute cooldowns at level 60.
---
My Warrior will follow my Rogue with Engineering, undecided if Blacksmithing will matter, so probably Skinning or Mining.
---
My Hunter will stay Herb + Skinning.
---
I won't be playing Druid or Shaman.
---
I bind everything to my scroll wheel. Never lost a duel.
---
Yes. They were great in PvP for that reason, but even then the Trolls Regen and Beserker had its advantages.
---
They're the best Tanks for threat generation (unless you have a good 1h axe then it's Orc) which is going to be even more important in Classic because of the changes to boss parry.
---
I would say if you're a horde Warrior and want to PvP go Tauren or Undead, if you want to PvE go Orc or Troll.
---
You missed He-Man the most powerful man in the universe!
---
Here is some food for thought.. the original vanilla launched with 2 mil people joining in a month, during a time before gaming hit the mainstream and servers were much weaker, while the internet was far slower. 
---
Did the game die?  No it did not.. the game ended up going to 12.5 mil players 4-5 years later.  without ever seeing a hint of decline until they botched the game up.
---
You think you're a game developer, but you're not.
---
I remember doing this for the first time as a Paladin healer.  Went OOM on the first wave, didn't realize the event was like 1/10th of the way done.
---
Needless to say didn't end well.
---
Definitely is. I hadn't seen this yet -- and Blizz even doubled down on it. That's a good sign. I was thinking of going Alliance this time for an change of pace, but this may be big enough to bring me back. Gonna miss out on that sweet stun resist though.
---
I know exactly how good the stun resist is, orc is unquestionably the best race in the game for pvp for nearly every class, war stomp is still incredible for shaman and it seems like you don't realize how good it is
---
Perhaps I am not understanding something... but how does phasing not have anything to do with being phased into a different layer?
---
Welcome to reddit where the first person to find your post has the power to completely make you invisible with the click on a mouse.
---
looks brighter too or something, colours more vibrant for sure.
---
oh I realize how valuable the warstomp is, in which you can combine a nova totem, lesser healing wave or a CL, but still, it pales in comparison
---
"Probably changes nothing" and "does virtually nothing"
---
These are the responses to probably the biggest disparity between Classic and Private servers. 
---
It changes a lot, but of course top guilds will be able to handle it the game is 15 years old dude.....
---
Patch 1.3 -- ''Spells'' in PvP now have a slight increase in range and area of effect when targets are moving. This should improve the overall usability of spells and ranged attacks.
---
Yes...The Mechanic for ''''''Spells''''''. Not Melee Attacks?? 
---
All you've been trying to prove is about melee attacks this entire thread. There has always been a ranged spell leeway; never a melee leeway. You are trying to combine two things together that don't exist. 
---
The current game has all Mobs and Players obtaining Melee leeway passively when players move and they are being chased. Upon standing still the mob or player loses the extra range. That melee range never existed.
---
I feel this.
---
I thought Satyrs were cool. I would have played a Satyr warlock, for sure.
---
That one Nelf on the left really want that God Emperor Junk
---
That book came yesterday for me. Disappeared into it and finished in one sitting. 
---
As a wow addict it was really cool to read.
---
I haven't had that problem myself outside a few latency issues I was getting. Everything feels pretty snappy.
---
That .4 is going to help with the changes to parry none the less.
---
Horde would still be better off going Troll tanks anyway so even I was too quick to comment.
---
The point is threat generation will be the top priority for Tanks even moreso with these changes.
---
Please understand that this Leeway has always been about Spells and never melee...The only gained melee range that has ever existed in Vanilla is Tauren range. 
---
Melee Leeway was implemented Cata+.
---
The guy on the lamppost just makes this feel so real
---
Yeah, but you appear to have picked the wrong faction!
---
My deepest condolences.
---
Doesn't matter if it's not specifically defined as walljumping or not (it is walljumping btw), this is still an exploit because it gives him an unfair advantage as it's difficult to pull this off and follow him. This is something people got banned for back in the day, so it's very much still an exploit.
---
Best in Slot. Almost each item of gear is the best piece available for a rogue at level 10
---
I feel like that would be the most efficient way to level. I think you're on to something!
---
just earthbind kite u can solo elite as sham
---
this was possible in vanilla, also pservers. 
---
It seems easier in beta though.
---
I never had a problem with it having ranked multiple times. It just gives you something to do if you're in a pug vs premade. With cross-realm I could see it developing into a problem, no community = no one cares if they bm you. Afk's and botters will be a much bigger problem than this is ever gonna be though. People make this kinda stuff into a much bigger issue than it actually is.
---
Years? Nah. They had some early WotLK world firsts, but that's it.
---
Maybe I didn’t need to include his name in the title? But genuinely just loved the videos and want others to enjoy!
---
It ends nothing.
---
The problem is that you are adding a vertical progression of new tiers that will cause insane power scaling issues with gear.  Naxx40 gear is already powerful... anything more is just nonsensical.
---
i guess some people still dont know theres chat function on WOW and ever worse forgot to act in polite manner to other player
---
Ahh. I hadn’t seen that acronym before and I played off and on until about 2015 from release. Thanks.
---
I wouldn't mind them buffing the MCP droprate to 100% or make it BOE tbh, I feel really bad for the people wasting hours farmig gnomeregan, it just would make the grind a bit more reasonable
---
Spell batching / Artificial Delay is one of the worst looking things of classic. It's no fun to play with, everything feels like shit.
---
it doesn't really though, I'm not saying it's better than stun resist in general but being able to guarantee you're going to get another important cast off CAN be better than an increased chance of something happening
---
shaman is the only class i'd actually consider not going orc, besides mage which isn't a choice anyway, literally every other class is better as an orc
---
it literally is not a big deal, whatever guild you're in isn't going to notice
---
Nice Corpsemaker. Love that axe.
---
Aww crap. I only watched the stress last night. I thought it was going to be over today or I would’ve. Thanks for the share man!

Wow great montage! Looks like a lot of fun was had!
---
Wait, does this mean I can't get my haircut?
---
That's it no Classic for me.
---
It looked hilarious/awesome in Dunkey's video but I doubt its something that will keep me for awhile.

Feel the same way. I played vanilla beta and release and I have no idea who any of these people are including most streamers or what have you.

So if I make the statement that gravity isn't real but do it on reddit I shouldn't have to add any proof or justification for that claim?

yeah gnomer is so bad getting a group for it is hard , i remember calling out for Gnomer group in IF and got nasty replies
---
O no ya'll turn turning into Runescape.
---
I never said it wasn’t an exploit. And it’s not walljumping. Walljumping is when you can continue to jump along a wall and stick to it after the first jump. Ever since it was removed from retail and still to this day, you can make the first jump stick to a wall, you just can’t do it after the initial jump. Soda only sticks to the wall on his initial jump which is something you can do even after walljumping is removed.
---
Yes, Taurens had an extra range that was static. What's happening now is that with movement all races gain melee physical range. Which is incorrect.
---
The classic experience might be enhanced and even more magical the second time around.
---
With social media, discord, twitch, etc. spontaneous world events like this may happen more often.  World PVP and world boss interference will be hilarious to watch.  The tactics and antics with large group planning in the open.
---
I didn't even notice the O, I was thinking to myself

"Who the fuck is Marii?"

Done. Now everyone is as short as gnomes.

&gt;because until late in the game

"1.2"

Unfortunately I remember that the hdd that had these was failing and I was only able to pull half the images off before it failed so I only have 577 screenshots of me 1-43 OTL
---
there you go again , you think your standard is the right one when in reality the standard is asking politely for group. Not everyone is non-talker and treat other ppl like machines without thinking of speaking in polite manner.
---
back in vanilla WOW , people understand this , they also understand it is very impolite to invite without asking  before. This is the vanilla people i remembered , not the modern entitled kid syndrome currently in retail
---
Nearly the same as you. Playing Shaman I'll start with skinning+mining and try to make as much gold as I can, then drop skinning for engineering.
---
Check out "Booshies" on YouTube. He is a small content creator that has started making guides for classic. Attunement as well as quest guides for dungeons and such. 
---
He recently got beta and has even been streaming some on twitch. Pretty easy to follow guides!
---
Feral was an exception to the rule. One of maybe 4 specs with complexity.
---
I'd just pick what you guys enjoy man. That's gonna go way further than picking an "optimal" combination.
---
If you plan to PVP druid/warr, priest/warr, and paladin/warr are all great combinations in group pvp, warrior just becomes a wrecking ball with extra cc/heals/dispels and BOF
---
I gotta say OP is really bringing back those old school feelings
---
I need August 27th to be today
---
SM Cath is brutal ..
---
Yea, had a mob phase out on me. People phasing due to grouping, all over the place. 
---
Chat should maybe not be cross layer. That way you are only grouping with people on your layer. Prevent layer hopping for quest mobs. 
---
Could still phase joining guild groups, but blizz said guilds would try to be put on the same layer anyway so it reduces that factor somewhat.
---
I believe level 6
---
I disagree with this, mainly because I had a similar experience with Old School Runescape. The game "died" in 2007 and came back in 2013. A lot of what we did as kids was inefficient, bad, or wrong.
---
Having the mindset, work ethic, and resources we will have now, the game will be significantly easier. Even for things that we never got to do. You know why? Because we've done harder things, we've had tougher boss fights, we know how to grind for exactly what we need to win.
---
I can foresee many less wasted attempts, better use of guild resources, and a much faster race to boss completion.
---
I can't wait to see this many people in Dalaran once they bring out WOTLK.
---
Background about me:
---
Played since release in 2004 when I was 18.  I will be a casual (\~10 hrs a week) coming into Classic. Due to my lifestyle I most likely will have to PUG for my pre-raid BIS gear and raids thereafter because I can't commit to raid times =(. I do not like to farm gold but I am very stingy and cautious on what I spend my gold on. Classes/specs I played in Vanilla was a Prot Warrior &amp; Afflic Lock. My current main in retail is a Prot Pally that I PUG with on occasion. I enjoy all class fantasies and find all classes and specs enjoyable in certain situations.  I've always played Alliance, and never reached endgame with a Horde character.  I like to do BGs (WSG/AV are my fav!) on occasion. 
---
Pick my class, faction, spec! =D
---
Thanks.
---
im sure youll figure something out no one in 15 years has!
---
Gadgetzan had one, no?
---
Well, I’m not convinced this is intended behavior either though. If I had to guess - layering may work as intended over a stable population - but with that stress test you had thousands of people spawning into one singular server (making this an absolute worst case scenario and probably not at all indicative of what launch day may look like) 
---
What they said in the dev interview was that if you filled a cup of water and it got full - you would just seamlessly add a second cup and continue filling it. 
---
I’m guessing that the server was forced to spawn several layers damn near instantly to accommodate the player influx - and the result of this phasing is probably them trying to fine tune where the top of that cup is. 
---
As they making changes and monitor it I’m guessing that the changing cup size is causing people to phase and experience that phasing situation similar to retail. 
---
This is all a guess though. I’m hoping that once dialed in - we should be pretty smooth.
---
Yup. I don’t know who or what any of it is but I love it all and I enjoy the hype to see people go nuts over a 15 year old game. It shows that we all have a common interest. I like sharing an interest with a community that was good to me when I played. A time online when we were a community, I hope that comes back with it.
---
That's exactly how it's supposed to work, as /u/Snelhest3 already showed you with the screenshot of the decompiler output of the 1.12 client.
---
It never changed.  They did get rid of introducing spears before launch though.
---
It will, but only until people are extremly overgeared and speedrun shit
---
Don’t let the Daily Mail see this...
---
I remember I used to do all kinds of exploit in Vanilla, my favorite was getting on top of Orgrimmar.
---
I remember doing the exploit in the vid and back in time (when you didn't have Youtube and everything available) I thought it ingenious that I had discovered this. Then I received an E-Mail from Blizzard stating that I had been banned for 3 days. I was devastated at the time lol
---
These walljumps do have nostalgic value for me, although I understand why people would want them removed
---
Rather than this I’d like to see them make a new mmo 
---
Based in Warcraft lore that had the lessons learned about progression/ community and making small things feel big.
---
Damn, really? There's no ebook version available anywhere? That sucks. One thing I would like to say, however, is the physical copy is gorgeous. The quality of paper, page layout, and the finish on all the images is top-notch.
---
Check the sidebar, there's a weekly thread.
---
Who ever told you that is a big fucking liar lmfao. Maybe for WC and a few low lvl dungeons but end game and raiding alliance have it easy as fuck. BRD, MC, and BWL are all right next to ally towns.
---
Yeah, but trends are always started by a small portion of the population. Via streaming, we already can see that some pretty influential players are over the moon about the beta.
---
I might be a bit of a sadist because I liked having to read the quest to find areas/places/things, even though I’d get kinda pissed after roaming for 30mins and still hadn’t found it. 
---
That said, I think people not knowing where quest givers/quest enders were brought more of a sense of helpful community when they had to ask. It was hard to find quest guides back then so we had to rely on our guilds/server mates for the hard to find stuff. Or when we finally found something that no one knew about and you could be like “guys! This quest starts the chain for -such n such-“. 
---
It was a much more difficult time but also much more rewarding and fun.
---
Paladin and Warrior have similar leveling times. If I had to compare it Paladin is the 2nd slowest leveling time after Warrior.
---
I did this for years on my priest up until (I think) Blizzard detected that particular bit of fun and neutralized it.
---
Agree. I’ve thought about it a lot and I just don’t care, I’m rolling paladin. Fuck you guys. LOL.
---
I don’t know if I would go as far as “single-handedly” but he playsca big part as one of the lead devs.

I would've been fine with the retconned "Broken" look because at least it was similar and it would've matched somewhat better with the clothing the rest of the races wear. However, even in comparison to what we got I would've preferred the image on the left in that concept art from before TBC launched. The muscles and proportions aren't nearly as cartoonish as in-game, and that was what prevented me from playing one and taking male Draenei seriously.
---
Pretty close to unless you count summoning the flag carrier pre 2006 =) wonder if that works. Did anyone test that?
---
Love to Tank, Love Sword and Sheild, Love PvP, Love Playing Solo
---
That's a lot of information without saying what type of gameplay you want to do in Classic.
---
I remember when they had screenshots of the day. i’d check it daily. one of them was 5 shamans using chain heal to make a pentagram!
---
It’s how it was in vanilla, there’s no change, what are you crying about? Play private servers if you don’t want the actual vanilla experience.
---
Yeah it was fun ! Lot's of corpse runs but it was nice overall. I enjoy how Blizz interacts with the community. We need it. Can't wait for Classic.

Not the game you asked about, but classic Everquest populations are several times larger than live.
---
Also with EQ, they release new servers on a yearly basis, sometimes with new rulesets, so you get a sort of seasonal server effect from the people who just want to replay the classic race all over again.

Shockadin?
---
I can almost guarantee they shut it down on purpose. I've been researching this for a few patches now. There are ties to the occult and satanic strew all throughout the World of Warcraft. 
---
I believe if people were able to complete the pentagram it would open the cage of the Elder God like being sealed beneath Blizzard Headquarters in Irvine, California. They have harnessed its powers to wield unspeakable magics, of which we will never see. They are feeding it our attention to keep it at bay. However if any people were to arrange themselves into a symbol of another deity.... 
---
This would be catastrophic. They would essentially be feeding the idea of another god to an Elder God. I cannot say what would happen if this occurred, as the manuscripts I have found do not detail this part, but speculate that the Elder God would absorb the power of the god, destroy Blizzard HQ and release 8.0 in perpetuity.
---
You are actually completely right about the experience thing. My bad!
---
Leveling improvements for Patch 2.3
---
Amount of experience needed to level reduced by 15% per level between 20 and 60.
---
Experience gained from completing quests increased between levels 30 and 60.
---
Outdoor elite quests will now now be soloable, with the same (or better) rewards.
---
About 60 new quests and a new goblin town based in Dustwallow Marsh (levels 30 to 40)
---
Level ranges for old dungeons to be narrowed down a bit (so that if you are high enough to start them, you are high enough to finish them too)
---
Increased questing experience for dungeon quests.
---
Buffed up item drops from dungeon bosses.
---
It's easy.  Whatever type of food your pet consumes, you should always be able to find a relevant place in your questing / grinding route that has mobs that drop that food.  Sometimes easier than others, but it isn't hard.  The better food (higher ilevel) the more effective it is.
---
source ? I would lvoe to see that
---
They should atleast have the option to have an RPPVP server. Even if it would be low pop... why wouldn’t you?!
---
Working out. Been having health issues for a couple years. When bfa released I played 18hrs/day for a week, felt dangerously bad. So I'm looking to try and drop 15+ lbs and lower caffeine intake over the next 3 months. Going well so far. This loop I've been jogging/walking a couple times a week I was finally able to full jog today. So headed in the right direction.
---
It’s not a nerf, lol, it’s just something private servers got wrong. Why is everyone freaking the fuck out about it?
---
Yeah, it felt so incredibly staged. Also, if the kid is an adult, kick him the fuck out instead of crying to the camerman about it.
---
Man.... you are a rogue through and through my dude! I don't want to be the one to break that up, so I'd say go rogue and don't worry about the class distribution or the competition on gear.  Everyone experiences this to some degree, its just part of what makes Vanilla, Vanilla.
---
Yeah, if anything I'd start with a hunter.
---
Sorry, you are not allowed to ask for opinions here.
---
Overall, these 3 videos are hysterical.  I still watch 1 and 3 sometimes.  oddly, some of the lesser-known tracks Mute uses are long-standing favorites of mine (the entire soundtrack of the first conan movie, Queen's Highlander music).  They are also something of hit jobs on rogues - mute plays the rogue unable to give a single intelligent answer to anything, while aaron (the lock) gets to nail down everything and dodge a few answers (locks have FEAR to try to get rid of rogues, in episode's 3 survival skill monologue)
---
I have wondered (and haven't seen an answer from, though one may have been made) what % of fights Mute/others lost naked or in wildheart with worn daggers getting their footage.  a few of those ranked players played like they were not their normal selves, and some of the others didn't seem to know what to do, period.

---
Warriors have a pretty low amount of overall skills so you're better off keybinding everything.
---
It would be interesting if they added third faction in TBC - with draenei, naga and blood elves (like it was in Warcraft 3). Illidan could be leader, not villain.
---
I'd say shaman. it's very easy to get a raid spot, ele is great in bg's, and you can heal raids in ele spec if you don't want to respec resto. Not the best farmer, but hunter and mage aren't on your list.
---
Warlock is harder to get in raids, good in pvp, pretty good at farming, can get away without respeccing. 0 chance you will ever heal.
---
What I want to know is what made Blizzard change their mind. They were adamant about not recreating it due to time, cost, etc.
---
Whoa, this is actually me; a 6ft 6inch human
---
Something need doing?
---
Sunken Temple was my spot. I loved that place.
---
Layers and phasing are two different mechanisms. Layers keep groups of players separate. Two different players can be in the same spot and not see each other because they are not in the same layer. Also they won't spontaneously change layers.
---
Phasing is how Blizzard manages the visual interactions between players who are in the same layer and in the same zone. Each zone is broken into a whole bunch of different sub-zones, like the cell phone network. Players only see the players who are in the same layer and cell as them. Things get awkward at cell borders as players transition between cells. This was really apparent in Legion where you could find places where you could step back and forth across the cell border and see nodes and players phase in and out.
---
And all rogues.
---
A senior engineer at blizzard who's worked there since the days of vanilla. While blizzard had talked about the possibility of classic servers on a modern WoW client, Omar seemingly took it upon himself to solve many of the initial roadblocks, and in doing so, convinced his peers that the project could actually be feasible.
---
That's the rough impression I get anyway from an anecdote told by...shit I can't remember, was it Ion who told that originally? Someone on the WoW team told that to media members and of course Omar became a beloved WoW meme.
---
Wotlk first, then outlands :D
---
You have rockbiter weapon for threat. You don't need to overlevel anyone. Try leaving it on in a dungeon. You'll notice pretty fast, that threat managment was not the issue.
---
You have less armor then Warriors / Druids though.
---
I remember running this and a guildie said whatever you do dont use aoe on the scarabs..... I didn;t know intimidating shout was aoe
---
Theres a few interviews with Ion where he states it’s something they’ve wanted to do for a long time. However, for logistical reasons they did not think it was possible until they sat down and figured out if it was going to work over a long period of time.
---
Bug Behavior: Dying immediately after successfully taming a mob will leave the mob unaffected while still giving you the tamed pet. Effectively duplicating the mob.
---
I died taming The Rake and revived to see a druid killing it. Called my pet and I had a copy of the The Rake.
---
IS THIS SPELL BATCHING FOR TAME PET?!?
---
That’s only because it hasn’t gone live yet
---
Once it does 
---
A lot of people both old and new will want to jump in and see what all the fuss is about 
---
Not saying retail is gonna die , but I feel it will be a ghost town once Classic launches for at least a month or so
---
what do you mean by gameplay? like what role I like to fill? That would kind of defeat the purpose of this thread, right?
---
This reminds me of the scene in Sword Art Online where they find out they're all trapped in the game.
---
FOR THE HORDE
---
Shaman don't have taunt but max rank earth shock does huge damage and threat, it often does the trick.   Only a 6 sec cd too
---
you will just go OOM too fast..
---
Supposing you heal in BGs, paladin covers everything. Otherwise 30/21 Shaman, although you should take a deep healing spec for the first few raids, luckily first few Respec are dirt cheap.
---
I’m confused because I thought it was always lv10 before you could train back in vanilla. Did it change in TBC? Maybe that’s where the confusion is.
---
I'm really hoping it pans out, but I have my doubts (like I do with any new MMO).
---
Nightfall is super situational and once mages spec fire, there won't be room for it on the debuff list. The amount of DPS lost by your spec will eat into the raid DPS bonus of the proc. Even with maximum uptime, it's only about a 4% damage increase for the casters in the raid.
---
No changes
---
Not a lot but they will be there plus the people who drag friends into playing
---
This guy is good.
---
I wouldn't mind if blizzard that route of seasonal/special rule set servers. One of my favorite things to do was to roll new servers when they were still coming out
---
WotLK was a fucking trashcan.
---
There are a few points worth considering with RS, though, that aren't applying to Classic WoW currently.
---
1. Runescape was nearly completely dead when OSRS was announced. The game very well could have completed died (we're talking less than 100 people) if OSRS didn't come out. While WoW isn't doing nearly as well as it did in it's prime, there are still at least a couple million people playing retail. Although, in comparison, that's only 20% of the playerbase they used to have. WoW still isn't near end-of-life, though.
---
2. OSRS has had changes made that weren't originally in the game back then. It still gets changed made to this day. I think this could benefit Classic WoW greatly, but currently, #nochanges is carrying too strongly. Half a year after launch, though, the #nochanges movement will probably be gone (hopefully).
---
3. Runescape in its prime peaked between 200-250k people online at once. This is a fraction of what WoW had, even at launch before becoming the giant it became. 
---
Now, that's not to say 1 and 2 won't eventually apply to WoW, but they don't currently is all.
---
If you love to tank, Warrior is pretty much the only choice for endgame. They are all about swords and shields. They are absolute beasts in PVP. The only problem for you would be that they are very awful to level solo, so if you love playing solo you'll have a hard time with that.
---
Druids, Paladins, and even Shamans can tank dungeons though if you don't mind not tanking raids. You'd likely end up healing in raids with those three.
---
Ultimately though, I think the best match for your description is Warrior. If you can get through the tough leveling process, you'll be rewarded with everything you're looking for.
---
In Vanilla it took me weeks to level my Warrior and my Paladin was second, maybe I just had the hang of it by then but my Pally I flew to 60.
---
I was thinking Pally because I made all my riches in Vanilla AoE farming as a Prot Pally. I figured leveling my Warrior with good weapons, enchants and money for mounts etc would just be a fun experience as both my experiences leveling in Vanilla come from fresh characters (Horde Warrior+ Ally Pally) never made a 3rd that was funded by a lvl60.
---
wow you try so hard to be cool. first time bfa glad?
---
that would be great to take a giant  suitcase with $ and wave it near the face of  Allen Brack with the words "You think you do but you dont"
---
There's nothing I use regularly that I don't keybind.  Not for some elitist hardcore PVP reason, just because it's a quality of life thing that makes the game more enjoyable to play. I try to bind any consumable that you use midfight. So I'll bind health potions or fire resistance potions, but not Elixir of the Mongoose.
---
When I'm playing my lock I give a healthstone. When I'm playing my Rogue I just feel like a selfish prick.
---
i don't bother keybinding buffs. i still keybind food/water to something very out of the way, however, like [.
---
Prot Warrior is calling your name. Go for it.
---
there will be way more people wuo never played vanilla than did.
---
just because a lot of people who played back here post and are vocal we will be the minority.
---
also dont forget every current retail player chances are will play classic whenever patches get boring
---
Hi, /u/1234typ
---
Loch Modan is one of my fondest memories from when I first played WoW. It was in Wrath but I am still so excited to see the original versions of all these zones again.
---
A COUPLE ounces? Jfc
---
why is the belt twice? that seems like a dumb bug
---
Our lord and savior.  I think I will generate a prayer to say at the start of every dungeon run and raid dedicating my run to him.
---
Thats interesting. Does Blizz ever respond to bug reports? Maybe when you died you got put into a different layer.
---
If Mortal Online had a better dev team it could have been this.
---
herb engy. if I play mage and archmage robes are bop I'll take tailoring then drop it.
---
I've taken skinning in the past but layering is gonna kill the devilsaur mafia so why bother
---
Thanks everyone, it sounds like I should take a close look at Shaman.  I also forgot to add priest to my list, probably too late now though lol.
---
Clearly for Tauren rogues.
---
Don't worry the clips stopped working. I do remember though when this sub reddit was much more friendly. Shame it's filled with so many angry people now.
---
Mining + Engy to engage in as much PVP as I can. Skinning is a surefire way to get your mount, but so is completing elite and chain quests and generally being smart with your money.
---
It’s the only way they can handle the load of thousands of players in a single zone at launch
---
Well I don't think so because the druid that killed the duplicate was watching me tame the first time. Unless we both got layered together.
---
Your warrior will become your alt. There's so much to do at 60 and if you're quick enough, you'll be in such high demand, that whatever you level first will eat away time from leveling your warrior. By the time you get your warrior to 60, he'll be several raid lockouts behind.
---
My theory is there is some overlap between the type of people drawn to Druid and the type of people who are so immersed in the game they fill out these silly little surveys.
---
INTP Druid here btw.
---
Sick flex. But that's not what the post is about
---
Whoa... majority of pserver players are just as cool. There is a minority of elitists on pservers that give us a bad rep. We just want to have fun like everyone else. We just like vanilla enough yo play pservers.
---
Oh I am a Warrior through and through. I just wanted to see if someone would say Paladin.
---
*Just to clarify incase others read this, you can tank endgame as a Druid, even up to Naxx, usually guilds will keep a feral Druid in their back pocket.
---
You can be useful in a raid as a Prot/Holy Pally but yes, you're only there for certain moments to tank and will be healing for at least half the raid or more. Can tank all the 5 and 10 man's though so if you are a casual player that can't fit a guilds raid schedule you could be your servers Prot Pally lol
---
I see. That is weird. Didn't ask if he saw anything by chance, did you?
---
To be honest i've even been looking for illegal stuff as well thinking someone would have posted it online  and it's litteraly impossible to find it.
---
Tbh that's fair cuz I too am INTP and have been considering druid and took this survey...
---
*Twilight zone music intensifies*
---
Weapon skill is still good because it reduces cleaves, and +5 appears to be closer to cap than previously thought. It just doesn’t change much about the crazy amount of parry.
---
I'm thinking about doing this myself. I want to main a warrior but I also want a hunter alt. 
---
My preliminary plan is level the hunter alt on another account first, and then level my warrior on my main account. I'll occasionally dual box to run myself thru dungeons to get gear and also this would make getting the whirlwind axe as soon as I ding 30 super easy. 
---
Or maybe I should just dual box level them at the same time...I can't quite decide.
---
10s to Train Two Handed Swords!?
---
I've been playing for 3 hours and only have 6s!
---
Today's stress test was actually far more interesting. They spawned a Hogger-skinned Thrall and had Patchwerk kill it followed by a giant C'thun all in Stormwind.
---
The problem is that in vanilla you could/can jump up walls whether or not they are invisible
---
They were probably true trolling you. Min max isn’t a thing till 55+
---
Oh look. Alliance favoritism again.
---
True. Think of all the encounters that will be captured this time by streamers and the like. Back in ‘04 I think we had fraps and my computer would drop to like 20 FPS when I turned it on.
---
Blizzard themselves said 1% of players experienced raids in Vanilla. They dropped the statistic right around the same time they announced raids would be moving to 10 and 25 man.
---
In the beginning of osrs a huge majority of the players were staunchly #nochanges but over time the community and devs worked together to create a path and manner in which the changes could be added.
---
The success of the changes is due to how the devs work and communicate *with* the community. Hopefully Blizzard can imitate that.
---
I must say Esfand is quickly becoming one of my fav streamers
---
Cool. Thanks for this. I’m gonna look up these interviews. I want to know more about this.
---
LEEEEERROOOOOOYYYYYYY JEEENNKIIINS!!!
---
Nah I didn't ask, I felt a bit naughty because I was asking her to stop killing the mob, and then she saw me summon the tamed version of it... lol so a bit awkward.
---
The fuck is this garbage?
---
You have no idea what you are talking about.  
---
Ensidia was a makeup of Nihilum and SK Gaming.  
---
Nihilum, led by Kungen, was world first AQ40 clear, world first Naxx
---
world first six out of the seven raids in TBC where they were beaten to it by: SK Gaming.
---
They had literally every single world first kill from AQ40 in Vanilla until the second to last boss in Ulduar.  
---
THAT guild got banned for the bombs.
---
Exactly 
---
The hype is only going to build more and more as the date gets closer
---
The one i watched today was on you tube search “wow classic interview with Ion and Calia”
---
It was possible in the stress test, at least. I can confirm that much.
---
It's in beta, so I would assume so
---
/dance
---
Exactly.
---
LOL
---
Exactly what I was thinking. I’ve actually had to think about what I want to get rid of to pick up a better item since i only have my backpack. I can’t wait to see the differences.
---
Why would you drop Tailoring on a Warlock with the Bloodvine set being BIS until Naxx?
---
r/monkeypaw
---
Thanks for the response. I'm trying to make a hybrid spec work and only now realizing how horrible vanilla wow talent trees were in terms of balance. Kind of makes me depressed how few raid viable specs there are.
---
I'm ok with that though because I work 12 hour shifts and have a kid, the casual go for me. I level quick when I play when I can but my times I can play are so speratic that I'll miss a handful of lockouts anyway.
---
Hard disagree with you there. But what can ya do?
---
There will be a mix of people. Not everyone can be bothered to read up about the game.
---
I'm currently leveling one on a pserver and I've been really loving it, definitely a good choice!
---
The high you get from those sick windfury procs is unbeatable.
---
Shhhh... Let people enjoy things.
---
The tyranny of the boot slot.
---
I feel that people who have this "alt first" idea aren't actually doing the math on paper before they start to really consider the idea itself.  
---
The math is not in your favor with this approach.
---
you did it, you made a spec that's worse at raiding than enhancement
---
That or over the course of 2 expansions ppl finally realized you are autistic :)
---
So you have limited playtime and plan to level the two slowest classes in the game? Your "main" won't be 60 for half a year at best.
---
Imagine imagining in 2019
---
That's for sure. I think if Classic WoW somehow, miraculously, becomes larger than retail, it won't be all of us who have played WoW before. I think it would be (potentially) millions of new players who have never played WoW. Considering there are no good MMORPGs out there currently, it could bring in a completely new wave of players, just as it did for all of us who played years ago.
---
That Teamspeak sound effect takes me back...
---
Everyone talking shit on the NE male when really he's just throwing a standard, non flashy leg kick.  smh
---
leg kicks hurt like hell no doubt one would interrupt a spell cast.
---
You seem to be lucky. We are not unlucky.
---
Exactly, this is expected of you to come fully prepared and you WILL be replaced if you don’t or you don’t perform.
---
Good plan.
---
At launch I don't foresee an issue getting the WW axe as there's going to be so many warriors that finding a group of 5x lvl30 Warriors to do it shouldn't be an issue.
---
superbacon
---
Hi, /u/Cha1R
---
Really just interested in pvp and view pve as a necessary evil to get gear. To the extent I have to do pve content I’d prefer healing to dps, but worry that it would be difficult to get good pvp gear for the dps spec of a healing class without a super accommodating guild. If that’s a real concern I’ll just go ahead and roll a pure dps class. Not interested in paladin.
---
Hearthstone and profession menus are the only things that I don't keybind.
---
DPS shamans are not viable in classic raid environment, sorry. 
---
Unless you are really stretching the definition of what "viable" is.
---
You couldn't cheap shot without breaking stealth in vanilla.  All openers broke stealth except sap when talented.
---
Wait why
---
It's cool, we can still be friends.
---
Made my night.
---
all alliance DPS has 30% threat redux
---
Alliance human tanks have like 15% higher TPS cause axes are garbage.
---
So what you're saying is, the guild that got all those world firsts wasn't named Ensidia. So Ensidia gets no credit.
---
Yes that's exactly how spell ranges work. Melee just as shown in all his videos have an actual 5yard range not a 7.77 like in Cataclysm/Mop/WOD. All of the evidence shown in his OP proves this
---
lol ok just messin around didn't mean to offend but go off
---
Hi, /u/MintyPuff, your post has been removed as it is seems to be talking about the current stress test. Please use the current [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bui555/stress_test_2_the_megathread_of_omg_why_can_i_not/) instead.
---
Technically 2~ months.  There will be no more heavy duty sress testing after the end of July according to their schedule.  
---
With that said, 2 months is still a decent chunk.
---
This got me so hyped
---
Tell that to Gutheros lol
---
Yes, but blizzard's track record of giving up and outright ignoring feedback is not a good one.
---
I would like to do a lot of dmg in both PvE and pvp. I want to be needed in raids or endgame content and have a fair chance to get geared. Gold making would be a plus and fast leveling.
---
y'know what i'll miss most about classic?
---
the barber shop.
---
I wonder what Omar is thinking with this whiplash of fame.
---
Aye, that puts a smile on the face.
---
That last screenshot says it all.
---
yeah, that's true. I'm sure there will be round the clock ww axe groups forming :D 
---
I know once I hit 60 I'm going to spend some time helping my fellow warriors get theirs!
---
Guilds have different guild chats lol... it clearly isn't working atm.
---
You'd think this, but there have been many times over WoW's lifetime where exploiters got a slap on the wrist at worst. The motto in every thread about an exploit has been "exploit early and exploit often."
---
Yea, and it is being brought up for discussion.  Why are some of you people so against discussion over these issues?
---
Didn’t have a streamer you mean
---
The way GW2 handles it is by having new stat combinations on the gear for more personalization.  Sure there is still always a *best* stat combo, but they've done a decent job balancing different specs with different stat combinations; Making it fine to run whatever you find most fun for yourself.
---
As a note GW2 lvl cap is 80 and has been since release, despite 2 expansions and multiple mini expansions.
---
GW1 was also the same way.
---
Also consider that certain hairstyles in some games can block more of your view than others. Also you're almost always looking at the back of the head, so that takes priority.
---
Then there's the whole subconscious thing where we personify our avatars. We generally prefer to play characters that are cooler than we are in real life. We want them to be tougher, interesting, more badass, etc.
---
There's a lot at play when it comes to character customization in games. Unless of course it's your 94th Dark Souls character, in which case you just spam "random", give it receding hair, and zoomzoom.
---
Yet they just announced they will be using layering for the entirety of phase 1, so of course people will be even more concerned about this crap now.
---
Mage checks all the boxes for your list.
---
Why is no one naked.
---
My playtimes are speratic, I have plenty of actual "/played time" to dispose. 
---
My shifts are 4 days on 3 days off so I have good chunks of time, the days are just all over the place.
---
As for the classes, well I only ever played Warrior and Paladin, aside from a DK. I level quickly on them, I know them well, I know all the quests etc. 
---
I know I won't be pushing server firsts anymore, no matter how hardcore I go I'll still be lockouts behind the more commited.
---
yeah it is filled with endless advertisement for streamer's twitch video , by streamer fanboys
---
Owl is the best pet for leveling.  [Here's a good post on the subject.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nostalrius/comments/4645yc/psa_for_hunters_pet_decision_aka_get_a_fucking_owl/)
---
It's mainly because of screech, which generates a lot of AoE threat and lowers AP (and stacks with warrior's Demoralizing Shout and druid's Demoralizing Roar). I've had a lot of bad tanks tell me turn off screech because they can't manage AoE aggro. Bats and vultures have screech but their stats aren't as good as owl.
---
I'm only saying you have no idea what you are talking about.  
---
It's probably the most famous ban in the history of the game, against a guild who's the most well known ever, which you didn't even know about.
---
Wow, discussion about the most, arguably important issue classic may face.  
---
Seriously, who cares.  It is discussion.
---
Yeah, vanilla was pretty rigid for raid specs.  Very few classes had more than one viable spec in raids.
---
Warriors could go prot or fury or some hybrid of the two.
---
Rogues could go combat, or very late (Naxx late) they could go assassination.
---
Mages had frost and then later Fire.
---
And druids could make OK tanks as feral that could do so so dps as cat when they didn't need to tank, or they could go resto.
---
There was also maybe a token shadow priest for shadow weaving (if you had 4 warlocks it was potentially worth it, but I think you needed 5 to make it worth more than just one more actual dps) and holy for healing.
---
That was it.
---
Some of my old ones were on xfire or old hardrives and are long gone, makes me sad.
---
you haven't even mentioned kodo hunters leggings
---
Who is Omar ?
---
still we are the king of PVP :)
---
If they add more content thats how I hope they do it.  With new gear with different stat distributions to allow different play styles.
---
Keep level cap 60, and just horizontal growth.
---
Yeh seems to be a bug in a beta.
---
If you want to raid as a shaman damage dealer please spec full elemental something like 33/5/13 you will not beat any dps but atleast you can beat the tank it is the best buy far spec for damage. And get ready to farm mana pots and runes all your waking hours
---
I just don't know that "before I eat this massive cake I've been waiting years for, I'm gonna eat this massive bowl of pasta first to prepare" is very wise.
---
What, you mean I shouldn't spend 150 hours leveling a toon to 60 when I could just farm 150 hours on my main at 40 gold an hour for 6,000 gold?
---
This is exactly how I would want it to go. Leave 60 as the cap.
---
orc has blood fury, so attack power, also has 25% stun resist, undead has shadow resistance under water breather and will of the forsaken aswell as cannibalize, orc will be better for pve and when it comes to pvp do u want to have RNG on ur side for stuns or be able to get outa fears charms and somethin else more as ur pvp trinket is fear charm and poly.
---

After reading your comment and rechecking the picture, I can’t see nearly as many pony tails on female humans as I can several other long hair styles. Even noticed a few short styles. Personally I used the two layer hairstyle in vanilla and will probably be reusing it if I roll human. Though I like green/purple nelf hair.
---
I know a nice cozy corner with LOS that would like to have a word with you
---
Hunters didn't have 'focus' until cataclysm I'm pretty sure.  They also gave hunter pets the ability to live for longer than a couple seconds while fighting a boss.  IDK why you would hate steady shot, you weave it in between your autoshot *exactly like aimshot in vanilla*.
---
It's clear you just have an irrational hate for TBC, or you aren't remembering correctly.  They did flesh out the specs, including hunter, perhaps you just didn't like playing BM which was the go to raid spec.
---
In fact the spec whose role and rotation didn't get improved upon were holy paladins who were still just flash of light spamming.
---
All the non-viable raiding specs from vanilla were given an actual role and the itemization to achieve that role.
---
Hunters were actually competitive in raid DPS, so they weren't the only pure DPS spec that couldn't deal damage.  They also changed misdirection so you could misdirect your threat to the tank which was a great bit of utility.
---
Hybrid specs like Boomkin, Spriest, Ele/Enh Shaman were given ways to not instantly go OOM and were given some unique utility, this made it important to bring some of them along even though they still did less damage than 'pure dps' classes.
---
From a raid viewpoint there is nothing that Vanilla did better than TBC.  The only issues with TBC are in the open world and PvP, with flying and resilience.  TBC also had a larger focus on raiding being the entire endgame content, so if you weren't into raiding I could see you disliking that as well.
---
Can anyone chime in on the Respec cost? I felt like the streamers were paying 50g, and it seemed their first respec. I recall it being this 1g, 5g, etc and I hope it is. Of course stress test is down now so I cannot check, but if anyone checked I would appreciate the knowledge.
---
Totally agreed.  Would have been cool AF.
---
The level 10 class quest dagger is better.  Not worth the trip - at all.
---
underrated comment right here
---
he blinked the incapacitate
---
But a boot on each tail fin!
---
I'd personally just go with the warrior first or just main the paladin. :)
---
Wont be too many.  BLizzard would have to market classic to the mainstream, which they absolutely wont do.
---
They wont compromise current WoW's success and expansion sales.
---
He missed Liono, leader of the thunder, thunder, thunder cats! Hoooooo
---
It’s so sickening that people will go out of their way to improve the game for streamers while suffering themselves... what sick sheep.
---
Just wait and see.
---
RemindMe! 90 days
---
Who knew it was hars to get 40 good ppl when some(like me) have jobs want to fuck our girlfriends etc.
---
Others wil happily raid 7 nights a week
---
I'm not looking at it in terms of math or leveling speed etc.
---
I'm thinking of overall general experience as I would enjoy leveling my favorite class in classic a way I never played it before, being fed by a rich 60.
---
Alternatively I would get my mounts faster and cheaper as a Paladin allowing me to better invest in the market at 60 and get in the auction house/making money game.
---
I don't care if my Main doesn't clear MC until month 2 or 3. By the time T2 drops my Main will be ready and I will have had a unique experience getting him there.
---
What is an Omar?
---
Yep I played a private a while back and enjoyed it quite a bit. Got to ~22 before I stopped. Felt like there wasn't any longevity in the private servers and I think it ended up getting wiped or something a bit later.
---
But man it felt great to help and get helped by others, have some real struggle in dungeons and make friends. Even players buffing each other as they ran by one another in the wild was helpful.
---
What a legend.
---
no, the hype will go down towards release and then spike back up after release. There's nothing left to see in this lvl30 cap meta
---
Can mods start removing these posts and consolidating them to a thread? I thought this sub was about classic wow and how to play it - not this endless debate about blizz game design
---
Eh, Idk man.  A good 8 million concurrent subs were active at the end of vanilla, meaning that it is likely that well over that amount of players at least tried it before unsubbing.  
---
The true majority of people who would return, would do so silently.  If blizz actually markets this even a little bit, people are back.
---
That’s hilarious
---
Nah same bro. I miss the old rivalry personally.
---
Well it's me and the wife. We won't go through it all, but what am I supposed to do potentially run out during release week? Then I'd have to leave the house or pay extra for delivery.
---
most of those people are 30+ now and have moved on from mmos
---
there are plenty of 30+ gamers but it will be the minority
---
Can confirm ammo is more annoying than pet. Like many things in vanilla, having the feed and manage the pet actually made it feel more real and rewarding. I loved my vanilla hunter pets.  
---
Also you'll get the opportunity to do the Rhok'Delar quest if you manage to find a guild raiding MC.
---
As a War, I always try to help out when someone questing nearby pulls too many mobs.      
---
Even when I'm just riding by if I see someone in trouble I try to help out. Only way us Wars can help other classes... by killing things....
---
$$$
---
Tailoring is going to be dead weight in that year or so until ZG hits.
---
WTF are you talking about? Blizzard has absolutely been marketing classic to the main stream. They gave beta access to people like pokimane.
---
wsg is also cross realm with the beta servers so you'll still face lvl19 hunters
---
I remember killing furbolgs....lots and lots of furbolgs.
---
Nightfall is a reasonably high priority debuff.  It isn't going to easily be pushed off, and it is constantly going to be reapplied anyway.  
---
I keep seeing people mention things like you did, but so many seem to forget that there are indeed priorities for every debuff in the game.  Example being that MS wont knock off basically anything else in the game that deals damage or debuffs the target in any way that affects raw combat potential for either side.  
---
Another one is that sunder armor never gets knocked off.  You'd have to have a pretty messy,  warlock saturated raid team to even begin knocking something like that off constantly.
---
I love the analogy and I get what you're saying.
---
 I haven't convinced myself yet as I said, was a crazy idea, sometimes you just gotta get it out there and bounce it around.
---
It happened to me. Got 3 day ban. I was pretty much an expert at wall jumping. I was standing on top of the wall behind alliance flag while carrying horde flag. It too few days to get the ban though.
---
&gt;*You thank Hecklefang Hyena.*
---
I remember doing this! We had like 4 or 5 people turtling with our FC up there, since we were one cap ahead. People were were saying "oh they'll never get us up here"...
---
Few minutes later two us are sapped and the ENTIRE Horde team is up there with us and destroying our FC :(
---
Horrible plan.  
---
6,000 gold isn't nearly enough to buy **literally everything you need for your warrior to be successful**
---
private servers, nostalrius, everyone who signed the petition etc.
---
I'd also credit the open core devs and pre-nost stuff, without that  nost wouldn't exist.
---
nost made them actually search for a solution which is where Omar comes in. There is other solutions they could've used if they wanted to make it happen bad enough ofc. Such as not backporting.
---
As someone with buffs, your happy jumps are pleasing to me ^_^
---
What's Shaggy Rogers doing playing wow?
---
Then why pick it up for Robe of the Void at all? You'll be replacing it in MC with one of the highest droprate items.
---
They just have pre reqs that usually begin in the starting area
---
We've peaked and it's not even live.
---
I loved BC. Maybe my post made it seem that I didn’t? But I thought vanilla and bc were 10/10 and wotlk was about a 9. Difficulty was a big factor. I remember when people were stoked to get a weapon that was 5 or 6 steps down from BiS. And I think that was a good thing. 
---
Like crystal forged war axe and valanos bow were okay gear in TBC. Now all blues are a complete joke
---
&gt;Lok'tar Ogar, brother!  
---
Let me hype you up about the Horde, right good and proper.  
---
You don't want chaos? Great. There is no chaos in the Horde. The Horde is not about chaos. It's about brutal *efficiency*. Orgrimmar's buildings are as they are because they get the goddamned job *done*. The Forsaken literally clawed their city out of rock just to fucking *survive*, man. You know how much pain and anguish exists within a Forsaken's mind, having achieved sentience after enslavement to the Lich King? A whole hell of a lot, I tell you what, but they've got a job to do, and that job is survival (and pure, unbridled vengeance).  
---
Survival is the name of the game. The Horde is a band of merry misfits, just trying to survive in a hostile world. The Orcs didn't want to be here. They were literally brainwashed by a bunch of fucking demons that shattered their homeworld and drove them insane, but they broke free of their bonds and, as a reminder of their former enslavement, impaled Mannoroth's big fucking head on a sixty-foot-tall pike. The Darkspear Trolls, maligned and hated by their kin for the grave sin of daring to help non-Trolls, eke out a meager existence on a pile of small islands. The Tauren find peace with nature in a small enclave surrounded on all sides by desert. The Forsaken, cursed with their very existence, struggle just to keep on not-really-living and not-really-dying.  
---
They find brotherhood and camaraderie in their shared suffering, and they fight for honor and the hope of a future prosperity.  
---
What the fuck does the Alliance have to offer? Ancient, decadent cities of their long-dead ancestors that they claim credit for, when in recent generations their legacy has been little more than xenophobia and racism? When Garithos, made leader of a full regional contingent by sheer chance, utilized his role to damn the High Elves and let the Sunwell fall? Or perhaps when the forces of Stormwind, instead of focusing their hatred against a literal intergalactic army of demons, decided that it was really the Orcs' fault that the Second War happened, and proceeded to enslave them and put them in concentration camps? So blind to incompetence and nepotism in their ranks that the highest elite ranks of Stormwind host not only the daughter of Deathwing but the nascent Twilight Father? And the Gnomes and Dwarves tinkering away in a mountain, giving fuck-all attention to anything north of Grim Batol? Or maybe the prissy and ancient Night Elves, screwing about in a magical tree in the north of nowhere, so incompetent in their racial history that they lost both Azshara *and*Nordrassil? Well of Eternity kaputt and all? And despite having millennia-old expertise with the machinations of the Burning Legion, they still don't prepare properly for Archimonde's assault? Nor does Dalaran, when the Kirin Tor are besieged "without warning", having conveniently not only ignored Medivh's warnings but also ignored the fact that he was possessed by Sargeras in the first place and also they're a bunch of goddamned super wizards? Might as well just put a big ol' bubble around their city and pretend they don't exist so that they don't have to help out any of the besieged citizens of Lordaeron.  
---
The Alliance's legacy is inaction, their birthright unearned and their morality tainted by base prejudice. They lay about, and when threats arise, they continue to lay about until it's too late to do anything but damage control, and then they blame their problems on the funny green fellows and throw them in camps. They're corrupted by the malaise of prosperity, and their shining cities belie their slow downfall.  
---
Who do you want to be associated with? An army of downtrodden, abused underdogs fighting for the right to live and assembled through fast bonds of wartime brotherhood, or a bloated bureaucracy of racist, snobby malcontents who abandon their allies to the Scourge and pretend themselves wise merely because of the age of the bricks beneath their feet? I prefer the underdogs. For honor! *For the Horde!*

Honestly i’m a runescape player as well and this shit reminds me of when they brought OSRS back, I honestly cant wait to be part of the community!
---
What kind of raiding are you wanting to do?  Are you planning on doing naxx40 in a guild that will need to raid 5~ days a week for 4-6 hours a day?
---
If you plan on raiding maybe 8-10 hours a week, then you can easily make that work with nightfall.. in fact, most semi serious guilds would probably love you for it.
---
beta
---
There is a beta that some people are invited to.
---
"The mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell." The Warrior's weapon skill rises quicker due to arcane knowledge.
---
This isn't a benefit of Nightfall. If knocks off better debuffs, it shouldn't be used.
---
That was my first thought too, damn carebears
---
Holy God you nerds. Idk why your arguing with these neckbeards, two both of you stop trying so hard to sound intelligent it's forced look at your old posts.
---
Op uou ignore him and poster stfu either prove him wrong or shutup your posts are a waste
---
aw damn, haven't touched WoW in so long because I was unhappy with the direction the game went, is there going to be a wipe after beta and has there been any discussion on a public release date?
---
if you want a farming alt first do a hunter/mage and farm devilsaurs but warrior really isnt that slow, and paladin is slower than warrior
---
I'm not surprised that a large portion of INTJs are warriors.
---
Layering doesn't work fine and people complaining about it are doing Thrall's work imo. This is blizz shoving a crappy solution down the communties throat and saying its fine.   
---
Layering is immersion breaking just like LFG. Short-signed fools wanting this shit so they can level to 5 faster. FML
---
Strobber, honestly, you're always BIS in my book
---
Is spell batching really that wide of a window?
---
Or they're trying to summon the Fantastic 4.
---
consider a mage if your not super into hunter. it requires no gear to farm DM runs and it can still farm devilsaur and levels pretty quick too
---
yes on wipe, 8/26-27 for release depending on time zone
---
Shoot mobs for people and let them pet your pet?
---
I know but dps are seldom threat capped in normal guilds
---
The GMs are racist against the horde smh
---
I will be doing this. My alt will be a mage who I will level first with a paladin main who I will level with rested xp. Yes I am aware that I could commit the leveling time to farming, however my alt is not solely a gold farmer, as I have much more fun pvping with the mage.
---
there's lot of WOW veteran but their experience are limited to retail WOW .. Most dont know anything about old world vanilla .. 
---
noob that rush in dungeons will be laugh riots as they think Classic WOW dungeons as easy as retail dungeons in the same zone / level bracket.
---
noob who ninja items will be more numerous as it seem civil behaviour in MMO now eroded into nostalgia
---
noob will randomly invite ppl without talking as many seem to lost their ability to talk politely to people and think this is 'normal'
---
they may be experts and veterans in WOW retail , but they are just noobs in CLassic
---
Definitely seemed like the private servers showed them the fan base around classic and the missing revenue they could be receiving.
---
Doesnt the censuses say majority is 30+?
---
Combination of beta and people using private servers.  
---
It's iffy to discuss them here, but there's a wowservers subreddit.
---
Everyone was running treadmill style.
---
No people asking for layering needs that.
---
I was waiting for one to drop to link it in general and say “I didn’t know they had legendary drops in classic” lolol I never got one spent 10 silver on bags 🙄
---
It's technical af. Feels a lot like melee to me which means replay value
---
Worst this it did was dungeon finder and that wasn't until the last major patch (granted that patch lasted a while)
---
awesome thanks
---
In terms of PVE, there's no question, Orc is better because of Blood Fury.
---
In terms of PVP:
---
Will of the Forsaken helps you beat two classes you already should beat and only every 2 minutes.
---
Hardiness helps you beat a bunch more classes, some of which you might have a hard time against.
---
All aborad the hype train first stop deadlines let's go
---
I sure do. I hated that long "walk of shame"
---
Nice
---
I'm gonna get hate for this but they need to fix wall jumping.
---
Was this Kilrogg server? Because I played with a druid named Beowulf and he was the best guy a guy could be.
---
Work, work
---
Everyone - get your downvotes ready - here it comes!
---
I am planning to be one of those who leaves after a while. And I hate to break it to everyone - but I know I'm not alone.
---
I played WoW hardcore from 2005 - 2006 for 10 months. For example, I've never ridden a flying mount before, so I don't know what any of that is like. I'm really looking forward to the nostalgia of what it was like for me to play WoW as a 15 year old who couldn't drive, and didn't do anything else besides play tennis. It will bring back some really fond memories - but that's not sustainable, and I don't want it to be. Not only do I have a family, job, etc. now - but games themselves have changed, and whether we like it or not, we've all changed since the era before the smartphone. I'm planning to get to maybe, \*maybe\*, level 20, if I'm lucky. I just want to do some questing, enjoy a couple months of evening exploring, and enjoy my time. It won't be more than that.
---
I'll cancel soon after that I'm sure. I'm really looking forward to it, but I do know a significant amount of people won't last - and that's not a bad thing.
---
If I'm being 100% honest, I get what Brack was saying in his quote, I really do. I just think it's something you can't say publicly as Blizzard's lore master, lol.
---
THANK YOU!
---
There's a difference between a change taking place and not noticing, and literally no changes taking place. Lets not debate semantics. Experienced players will notice, you might not. Doesn't mean the changes aren't impactful across the board for raiding in Classic vs Pservers.
---
Shame he rolled horde.
---
Robe of Volatile Power's crit is excellent in raid settings but mediocre for farming. Raw spell power is better for multidotting. Also, saving DKP towards other upgrades and giving other players more meaningful upgrades is an important consideration.
---
This is absolutely wall jumping.  What are you on about?  You should not be able to scale that wall and wall jumping relied on being at an 80ish degree angle with the wall.
---
Prolly faked lag to get the "Feel" right.
---
It eliminates the most important aspect of the game: socializing with people. The game isn’t about getting your character geared. It’s not about killing bosses in dungeons or raids. It’s about playing with other people. And LFD/LFG makes the game pretty much a single player game, and WoW is a really shitty single player game.
---
Shadowfang Keep or Scarlet Monastery as Alliance on a PvP server will always be my 2 favorites.
---
Mainly it just means the 'admin' time is much higher. Waiting for people to get there, making sure people are buffed, ready for pulls, have consumables, repaired, release and run back, aren't having smoke break, at the toilet etc etc. You spend a lot less time in a 40 man actually playing the game than in a 25 man.   
---
Practically speaking that means you really want to be raiding 2.5-3.5+ hour blocks to get stuff done. In TBC with 25 mans that is drastically reduced. Having raid times of 1.5 - 2 hours is dramatically easier to fit in most people's real life schedules.
---
am i the only one who read it as OMARF at first?
---
no no no it should be tauren so no one fits throw a door.
---
This might actually increase threat generation on some fights sins tanks take more damage and therefore gets more rage
---
You know what, I don't normally comment to say things that are frivolous because that annoys me... but grand-fucking-job. This is how the internet should work. Kudos all around, marvelous.
---
most players dont even use reddit
---
Org was empty last night.
---
I’ve always been horde but will be rolling Alliance this time around. I’m worried that TONS of people are going to roll Alliance due to the clear bias.
---
i feel that but thats cuz i work with 7 other guys over 6'
---
Same! The moo cows are peaceful people 😬
---
there probably was one guy called beowulf on each server tbh
---
Turn up the volume in Wailing Caverns for a truly eery time.
---
Incredibles release date: November 5, 2004
---
World of Warcraft release date: November 25, 2004
---
**Me too, kid.**
---
Walljumping is when you can continue to stick to the wall after the initial jump. You have always been able to make the initial jump stick to the wall, before and after walljumping was removed.
---
I was one of the dancing bears! Such a magical moment when Omar appeared.
---
Good point. But bad assumption
---
Sorry I'm a bit OotL.   
---
Is this a former Blizzard developer streaming Classic WoW while talking about how they made the game?
---
I think you miss the point entirely. "You think you do, but you don't" is just an extremely arrogant thing to say. Who is he to know what somebody (anybody) else wants? The success or lack thereof of Classic has no bearing on the validity of the phrase.
---
Is that a real thing? Tests have said INTJ like the 2 times I took them in the past and nobody ever said "oh wow" or even was surprised since its rare or anything. Isn't it just more likely that people who don't like social events and do enjoy being inside playing math based video games, end up in that category?
---
For God's sake will someone slap the hunter, his freaking pet is gonna pu-
---
Ads...
---
I had an abusive relationship with this dungeon as a resto shammy.
---
I've seen it before, would not surprise me in the least.
---
Undead animations are far superior. And you can macro flavor text with cannibalize.
---
Lots of tryhards level a mage or hunter before warrior to farm gold with. Not necessary unless you will 100% be raiding from MC to Naxx with full consumables or with regular talent changes.
---
That patch just extended the mechanic to spells as well. It only existed for melee before that.
---
Let's hope the Classic team overtakes Blizzard
---
I'm gonna be playing Alliance but I really hope Alliance won't be that much of a majority.  
---
Of course because of paladins and many other reasons there will be more Alliance players no doubt about it, but world pvp is really boring if it's a 10 vs 1 rape.  
---
Right now on retail servers have a faction, sort of, I know that twisting nether on EU is about 99% horde and there are other servers where Alliance or Horde has 90%+ representation. It doesn't really matter because of cross realm and the world is irrelevant but on classic that would be extremely unhealthy for the game.
---
SW:P only if the Spriest is OOM.
---
Hunter's Mark hardly ever.
---
How is your opinion different than the people who believe the population is gonna be way higher? Noone knows and neither side has an argument. Let's see what actually is going to happen rather than pretending we know what's gonna happen
---
Honour died when I was corpse camped for 30 minutes in Hillsbrad by a 60 when I was lvl 24.
---
There is no honour in Classic.
---
I'm putting together a group to play on a PvE server, horde side. Interested?
---
It’s more than just nostalgia. Try it out. I bet you can’t stop by level 10.
---
Bump very important.
---
can't really narrow it down when you want everything.
---
Let me assure you, the world PvP griefing will reignite the rivalry in exactly 0.00002 seconds.
---
Layering is vanilla cancer
---
You still play bfa?
---
i was playing the stress test . i ran out of arrows twice just going to lvl 10 ... and i would pick up 400 at a time ( before i said fuck it and fill my quiver )
---
Yea...you're not getting into Wailing Caverns.
---
I'll end up PvPing far more than PvEing. 
---
Engineering will be a large gold sink for me.
---
I'm putting together a group of online friends to play on the same server: NA, PvE, horde-side. Interested?
---
I was a shaman, I could only bow and be appreciative. I’d help people I ran past kill stuff tho
---
No FRAPS watermark, must be fake
---
I called ENFP's being warriors before I even clicked, but rogues? That's weird
---
Congratz m8, nostalgia feels wonderful.
---
Alliance have less fear users than melee because of the worry of WoTF. Orc is definitely better in premades BGs, by far. No competition.
---
Just so you know since you're blindly speculating; this was the first time I watched Venrukis' stream, and I only watched it for 2 hours. My post had nothing to do with advertising. I wanted to share some high level open world pvp while we wait for Classics release. Sad that you're so butthurt though; be happy, we're getting Classic in a few months!
---
thank you!
---
Is this classic though or is it just starting from scratch?
---
This puts zf in my top 3. 
---
I remember we pulled the whole bottom bit and wiped hard.
---
Yeah it was a good time. Most of my favorite transmogs to this day are those old MC and BWL tier sets. So much nastolgia over them and they honestly look good, mostly. It was simple, but each class set looked and felt unique, and that was okay.
---
Unless you’re unlucky enough to be on asmons server.
---
In 2004 we called these Icons
---
The newest one that came out a few months ago has massively sped up XP gain, and raids reset twice per week instead of once.  Also much higher chance of finding rare mobs and loot.
---
The idea is this is a racing server, which might not be for everyone, but for a certain segment of the community, it's amazing.  For everyone else, you can still play on a relatively untouched vanilla server if that's more your speed too.
---
I use feint all the time.
---
It's bad, but it's not weeks through barrens bad.
---
You can hit 18 in a solid 12-14 hours of play time.
---
I'm really sad that I lost mine. They were all on an old family pc and who knows where that went
---
Yes definitely! I had always been Alliance in the past but, Horde seems like a nice change of pace to be back in WoW.
---
Really shows how much taller night elves are.
---
Because of sharding, it’s already a ghost town. 😂
---
Mage. I’ll be a rogue so less competition.
---
Maybe they should have announced immortal at Chinese Blizzcon...
---
Yes and I get so ragey when I get ganked. It makes it not fun for me lol.
---
Is there a way to make them Grind them to exalted? I never figured that out.
---
were you aiming at yourself?
---
He was also a developer on vanilla WoW.  He's been at blizz all this time, and it's great seeing the community coming together to recognize his efforts.
---
Was telling a co-worker about it months ago - this week he comes up and says that even he is hearing about it now: and he is hearing good things.
---
When everyone’s begging for a tank and no one else is around, they’ll make it work. 
---
Marking targets will return. And people will have to play with control.
---
Sign me up
---
Ahh, gotcha. Haha. I'm a Boost man myself
---
game's not out for 3 more months dawg
---
You only need friendly for the rewards. The rep gains drop off after that, but there is some crazy achievement if you get them to honored and somehow get your booty bay rep and a bunch of others to exalted as well.
---
They're called emojis on Discord, but I suppose these could be used as icons as well.
---
Swaggity swooty, her comes the booty
---
Feels :(
---
i can't wait to be a priest and give out the best buff to everyone i see B)
---
Yeah no kidsing, not to take away from the guys nostalgia because I'm sure they have some amazing memories but AFAIK gnomer tends to be at the bottom of anyone's list of favorite wow dungeons
---
psh, ally is some boring ass basic stuff, FTH!
---
Some people suggest this idea :
---
Main = Skinning and Enchanting , send mats (linen and skin to alt) -&gt; focus on making wands fast
---
Alt = warlock leveled to 6 and then go learn tailoring and leatherworking , feeding green cloth and leather back to main to be D/E..
---
The human mage with red hair who is looking in the other direction (left side of the picture in the front). He is arguing with the girl behind him because she kept dancing so hard and pushed him in the back during the whole concert
---
he comes off as kind of aloof to me
---
I can explain, his hat is too big
---
Go buy those mats. What are you waiting for? XD
---
So tired I thought this was Runescape from a distance ....
---
Just follow your heart and play what you want. People are retarded and think you absolutely have to play a certain way. Classic raids are easy, so unless you want to go AQ 40 and Naxx, everything is viable imo. Thinking otherwise is a retail way of thinking that I hope gets purged.
---
Your post has been automatically removed because you used a keyword which is reserved for the subreddit moderators.
---
I guess what people consider wall jumping has changed.
---
I mean just look at private servers. We had a warrior recruit the other day who didn't know mocking blow was essential so he didn't even learn it. How can you be that clueless about a class you've poured hundreds of hours into just to get to 60? And this is a private server, it requires a fair amount of knowledge about WoW in general just to know they exist, let alone play on them. 
---
Yeah there will be noobs. There will be mages thinking fire is awesome for leveling. There will be tons and tons of people trying to summon their party members at the meetingstones, the forums will be spammed by "summoning stones are bugged" posts. You'll have rogues who can't stunlock anything to death, warriors who spam revenge instead of shield block as a famous streamer did the other day (in case you don't know, revenge procs from blocks and shield block makes you block). 
---
Our raids will be full of people who can't do anything else than pressing their one attacking button. Warriors who can't taunt a mob when the tank dies and so it runs rampant in the raid. Priests who are oom in seconds because they don't downrank. And threat will be such a pain to deal with as people acclimatise to not being able to just go all out immediately. Many mages and rogues will be roasted alive. 
---
Razorgore will be such a pain in the ass for thousands of guilds. Vael usually gets a bad rep but I've always thought normal geared Razorgore is one of the worst encounters for noobs. Always there's a retard who just can't help himself not fucking up the hunters' kiting by attacking the damn dragons. 
---
AQ will be even worse. I've been in quite a few guilds on private servers over the years and one thing I've learned is that it's completely impossible to get 40 people to notice a big fucking icon that covers half your screen saying PLAGUE! while half the discord is yelling your name. Truly amazing how terrible people can be and in a 40-man raid you can't avoid them.
---
I haven't noticed any issues.
---
honestly, i thought that's what they were going to do with TBC way back in the day. the third faction could have been the Illidari, and it would have included Blood Elves, Naga, Broken Dranei, and Fel Orcs. it would be led by Illidan and the outlands would be designed as a third big continent like kalimdor or azeroth with starting zones and leveling areas all the way to some new endgame content.
---
you can imagine how disappointed i was when they revealed TBC's actual setup.
---
Zero chance. Many bugs left to fix anyway
---
Ah nice. Thanks.
---
Best item I’ve ever gotten.. still have it as a keep sake on my retail main.
---
Many bugs! HANDLE it! Or they get 50 DKP Minus! :)
---
Sell blues nearly always. Vendor high value greens (plate + most weapons) DE the rest.
---
12 hour shifts are you mental?
---
Lol. Every single one of your comments on reddit is filled with so much condescension and negativity. Why do you bother?
---
Many many many many months.
---
Dude that’s crazy.
---
That's not naxxramas, but stormwind's royal palace
---
&gt; He literally announced classic in front of blizzcon audience with words "turns out you do want that". Stop being moron. Your hate boner is childish.
---
I don't remember him saying that. Wasn't it just the ice cream thing?
---
Rarely. Still lose with one on your team because he has worse gear than a lvl 10 twink
---
Depends on the class. After whammy get dual wield (40?) the 49 twink shammy is a blast. Rouge get early advantage at 19. Look into skills + available gear
---
Silly warriors, only needing 32 binds..
---
Explain your thoughts on that.
---
I do 100% I think it bugged, but we eventually got it
---
Don't play a tank unless you think you can organize people and play alot. Tanks are leaders imo. I recall being in charge most of the time in groups...and having to form groups myself in vanilla. It was a lot of work. 
---
Mages are awesome but you will have super high gear competition. Hunters are the opposite... low competition for raid loots (melee weps excluded), but at the same time... super low demand for hunters relative to other classes.
---
If you play a priest your friends list will explode and you will constantly be getting tells from randos to group up.
---
Druids are gimmicky. Not my cup of tea.
---
Time to play some roulette. You literally can't go wrong with any class.
---
Of those choices, I'd say Mage. Hunter just scales so poorly with gear. You're basically in raids for one spell on a few fights.
---
Ya, there is one mob in...Arathi?! You get 1 rep per kill.
---
I tried that and found some great servers but can't seem to find a reliable 1.12 client :(
---
Insane in the Membrane
---
19 and 29 are too simple and imbalanced. Not enough classes have fleshed out abilities yet so hunters and rogues run the table.
---
49 and 59 are well-balanced and you also get mounts, so they're like 60 PvP Lite. But gearing is a pain and queue times will be long.
---
39 is the sweet spot imo. You have most of your primary abilities, the gear grind isn't too brutal, and the bracket is fairly active.
---

---
I wouldn't pick up Enchanting until your Mining/Herbalism can no longer be used because it's not high enough for the zones you're in. The early DE mats aren't worth much.
---
Yes. Some people like TBC, but it wasn't good. The storylines were boring, and every single zone would destroy your eyes with terrible choice of colors. Eye-burning red, Acid-Green, Nauseating purple and so on. It was totally immersion breaking and really made the game look cartoony, which was made even worse by the two new races that were jokes in themselves and looked nothing like the badass versions from WC3. 
---
Zones and quests and lore were a lot worse, there was no subtlety or mystery to what was going on either.
---
The only thing TBC had going for it was class specs, some of them were pretty good, others weren't. The raids also just looked like big cartoons.
---
See you in AB.  
---
Lok'tar ogar.
---
I think you're very right. i played a prot warr on private server and i enjoy leading the group and marking and all that. but to be a raid tank just seems VERY time consuming and serious. I might not be ready for that. I just love tanking.. damnit
---
ZG for cool tiger mount!
---
But then you have 2 green daggers
---
Thats a terrible idea. Servers were merged only when absolutely necessary. After classic launch, however, server would have to merged left and right if layering is not implemented. Server merging is a long and gruesome, it fucks with the economy, PvP ranking, faction balance, not to mention the technical issues it presents for Blizzard. Also, it does not adress the possibility of a population influx when retail is hit with some form of content drought. Layering is an elegant way of solving all od these issues.
---
Doesn't the undead male straighten the raised leg right at the end of the kick animation?
---
&gt;There's a difference between a change taking place and not noticing, and literally no changes taking place.
---
duh
---
&gt;Experienced players will notice, you might not. Doesn't mean the changes aren't impactful across the board for raiding in Classic vs Pservers.
---
a change you won't notice is by definition not impactful, sorry kiddo
---
Scrolling past this after seeing all the posts of the Alliance spelling Omar makes me proud.
---
Eww, retail water.
---
Alliance filth
---
If they did go earlier my friends and I would have to cancel our vacation time that has already been approved.  Which might be difficult. But I'm all for it.

Played on Pservers for 4 years dudeski. I'll notice. You may not though, stop projecting.

    [H] Cerberus - Hardcore PvE Guild - PvP Server - US East (All welcome who can make raid times)  
---
While wanting to relive past   heroism's at a competitive level, the goal of the guild is to progress   at a pace that suits the core of the guild. With only two days in our   raid week, the core of the guild will be held to high expectations to   maximize the time we spend in raid. These two raid nights will have   minimal downtime and minimal tolerance for repeated poor performance and   coming to raid unprepared. Ideally, we seek to recruit the top 1% of   skilled players who no longer wish to commit to a 4+ night per week   raiding schedule.
---
Off nights are to be   spent farming consumes, gold, pre-raid BiS, 20 man’s, and, of course,   doing other things you love/need to do. The last thing we want is to   burn out our core and, with a more intense raiding schedule, farming   consumes, gold, and pre-raid BiS can be very volatile to the turn over   rate of players.
---
Maturity and respect is very important. Drama of any kind will not tolerated.
---
Leaders   of Cerberus have countless hours, accumulating to years, of leadership   experience throughout retail WoW and other games and MMO's.
---
**Raid nights will be:**
---
    Tuesday and Wednesday evenings at 8:00PM - 11:00PM (EST)  
---
    
---
    Invites will begin 30 minutes prior to raid to ensure we start AT 8:00PM SHARP!  
---
**Loot System:**
---
    Loot Council  
---
**Our Goal:**
---
    To progress at a competitive level, on a casual schedule, in a hardcore and mature raiding environment.  
---
**Core Raider Requirements:**
---
    18+ years of age (some exceptions apply for mature/outstanding players)  
---
    Minimum of 87.5% raid attendance (~8 raids a month - 1 missed raid per month AT MOST)  
---
    Showing up to raid on time and prepared for encounters being executed that day  (including proper add-ons, consumes, etc)  
---
Thank you for checking out the post and feel free to apply or contact me on Discord:

You could also just go with robe of winter night and save yourself a fuckton of time and gold. Not really worth 6 spellpower. Also no int on robe of the void.
---
I enjoyed 29 but that’s because hunter is an unstoppable machine lol
---
I now understand why i struggled so much playing everquest as a kid.
---
just list them all then :) You haven't narrowed anything down lol
---
They can tune it so the new gear is needed. You don't need to level to increase item levels. Maybe the first boss has massive Frost dmg and you need FR. You can tune the new armor with fro armor pen..etc
---
The point is you can't right? Can't blink sap/gouge/grenade.
---
Polymorph enemy players to heal them up after a hard PvE fight
---
Go ahead, call me a carebear (on a PvP server)
---
See: OSRS
---
0% chance
---
viable = doing the minimum dps that, if all the raid does the exact same number, the boss dies before causing a wipe.
---
If distributed evenly everybody needs to do at least 300 dps to kill a boss, and you do 299dps, then you are not viable. if you do 300 you are viable, even if there are optimal classes/builds than can do 1200.
---
The joys of a druid in catform =P
---
Yikes I didn't think of that! I go on a 9 day camping trip in June. I never used vacation to game, but I would if I had the extra days laying around maybe,
---
I don't know why people keep saying this. It's like saying Horde won't have as many Warlocks or Priests because Fear Ward exists, or that they won't have as many Rogues because Stoneform exists. Available private server statistics don't show any meaningful decrease in Warlock and Priest players among Alliance compared to Horde (I can't link them here because the AutoMod deletes messages with pserver names, but you can find the stats easily enough), I don't recall there ever being such a discrepancy in Vanilla, and I highly doubt that people in the aggregate will ever be making that decision in Classic. "Oh, no, I can't play a Human Warlock after all because some plurality of Horde players can break out of my fear once every two minutes!" Enemy racials, if they do affect class selection, do so only marginally, to the point that it might as well be statistical noise.
---
If you're indecisive play a hybrid. Tanking not so much, but as a shaman, paladin, or druid you have more ability to switch roles between heals and dps. In raids you are pretty much stuck healing but you can change it up for 5-10 mans and PvP. Vanilla wow is a long ass leveling grind. It can be nice to have some variability at level 60.

Orc for min max.

Undead for style.

Just roll orc and drink Noggenfogger elixir
---
Action is coming ZULUL
---
If you want to heal go Druid. You can always get a group for any pre raid content if you get a tank and a heal set. And if you find a good guild they will love your utility for off tanking and raids healing raids. You get speed boosts while leveling and it’s great for a pvp server with your tool kit leveling up. Herbing is easy money and you can also tank reserve orbs for live strat runs. Quick easy money If you get a good group.
---
I finally decided on hunter. Thank you for this!
---
lol Florist Gump...
---
Oh hey, that's me in group 8. :D Tried to invite as many people as I could because I didn't get to join in on any main layer fun last time.
---
Horde: Endgame+PVP
---
Alliance: Leveling+PVE
---
That's it. Everything else is bluster.
---
i always wanted one of these back in the day 
---
company no longer exists yeah?
---
I'll main warlock with mining/engineering while leveling. I'll probably switch mining out for either alchemy or herbalism. Not quite sure yet. In my experience alchemy is pretty bad because every guild has a bunch of them who make all the pots for free. Only the flasks make money and the recipes are really rare and expensive. I might do it anyways just because I love alchemy. 
---
I'm debating between a druid and paladin alt with engineering and a gathering profession, probably herbalism.
---
Second alt I don't know, probably one of the two I'm debating for first alt. 
---
I really like druid flagrunning and they are more interesting to heal with than just spamming flash of light. On the other hand I want a reckadin who can one-shot fully worldbuffed mages on their way to raid.
---
Is that cloth quest in vanilla? You can get around it by picking and choosing your leveling up quests more carefully. I intend to get a raptor mount as an orc by about level 47, not cloth grind needed.
---
Druid and Mage. Both can farm, level fast, do PvP and raid. You can even spec HOTW 0/30/21 druid so you can both tank and heal, but it's not the best for flag carrying.
---
There is no dynamic respawn of the nodes on classic. You will be competing with a lot of other players in the same lvl range for the nodes. It is inpossible, absolutely impossible to keep mining/herbalism on par with your levelzone. So you would HAVE TO get out of your way and stop leveling/grinding to level up herb and mining.
---
This is all time you could invest in farming at lv 60 (satyrs, ogres, even maraudon). Which would yield a lot more gold. The only professions possible of yielding enough gold and always staying on par with your level is skinning and DE. The first of which gives a good amount of it.
---
For your pre-raid BiS - Why no Lionheart Helm, Black Dragonscale, and Devilsaur Hide sets?
---
I want a DPS class that looks badass in gear, is easy and convenient to level, has utility I can use to help others, is good at grinding alone, and which doesn't fall off competitive DPS throughout AQ/Naxx, and has an at least minimally interesting PvE rotation
---
&gt; What if the game only experiences slow growth for a couple years rather than drops people more than it gains?  Then layering will stay.
---
Then they do the same thing they already did when the game first launched and that exact thing happened: add more servers and have people transfer to them (and have the majority of new players roll on them).
---
Before deathwing did an oopsie
---
Oh right, oh god was I stupid back then. That's a good idea.
---
Standard for uniform road officers. 6am-6pm.
---
Unless you have court that day.
---
“Streamers are ruining classic” 
---
Right..
---
Esfand is one of my favorites since he came back. Will definitely be watching him for the alliance side of things, soda for horde.
---
Invite nearby people running the same direction as you and give them AOTP
---
Doesn’t mean people won’t stop talking about it or continuing to play it 
---
Like I said the closer it gets to launch the bigger deal people will make about it and start spreading the word to friends that they should try it whether they played Vanilla or not 
---
You can’t say it won’t get bigger because you are only assuming that because people can’t go past the 30 Cap people won’t wanna keep playing , it will only make people wanna play it more when it releases because they wanna see what the endgame will be like as well as the community and that’s for both new and returning players
---
y i k e s
---
Probably the second most awe inspiring thing in that region. I remember seeing for the first time and just staring at it for awhile.
---
Then there's me, a warrior. :|
---
I do my best to /cheer them in response in lieu of a buff.
---
Whichever one your friends are in
---
It's fairly substantial for Melee DPS while leveling, as you're always a few weapon skill behind the cap if you are leveling properly.
---
If you have some time to kill and want to learn a bit about the creation of Classic WoW, [check out this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhKkP8LryYM) It'll answer your question and introduce you to some other devs.
---
I'm going to immediately farm Baron Rivendare for his warhorse on a human paladin, so there goes your racial mounts. :p
---
have fun
---
A little sad official launch won’t be like this.
---
ive never done this what rep is the 40 mount?
---
does just doing every zone quest get you there?
---
It is, but it wasn't implemented with the game release. I believe you won't be able to access it until Phase 3.
---
Shit I swear some of the posts in this sub are gonna bring me back for classic.
---
Nostalgic like mad.
---
It's highly unpredictable, depends on your auction house at that time
---
Why not just play PVP if you want to play a hybrid spec. It will always work anyway. I mean burst damage melee spells why not. Might not be the best but nobody will complain it's pvp unless you want to join premades.
---
A Retadin...the shame.
---
They all went undead or nightelf. Those races had like a 90% chance to be the avatar of some sniveling, acne filled twat whose balls haven't dropped yet.
---
Hard no
---
[deleted]
---
i'm under the impression that it displays and behaves like an incapacitate but is effectively a stun that breaks on damage, orc stun resist affects grenades and I think you're supposed to be able to blink out of them
---
I don't think you can berserker rage out of them but I may be wrong
---
they are always threat capped on horde side, now its gonna be even worse.
---
Beautiful story.  Would read again. 
---
Seriously
---
I thought that initially as well before beta hit and I saw only a few of his YouTube videos. Once you watch his stream for a bit and start to understand his personality it all clicks. I had that same feeling towards Asmon as well but after a few hours of watching him I eventually got the character he was going for. 
---
It's all entertainment at the end of the day so they each have a 'character' to keep the chat entertained. Provides some variety. Between Esfand and MadSeason I am pretty damned entertained. In fact I'm constantly realizing that I'm wasting way too much time watching them and am not being as productive because of it.
---
Still faster to level the warrior first lol. Imagine how long it takes to lvl one character even hunter will take a very long time.
---
why not make 12 threads like this everyday :)
---
then make 12 more about how tbc servers would be better :)
---
then make another 12 about how streamers are bad people :)
---
oh wait its already been done :)
---
Which means more rage on the tank and more tps, swings and roundabouts.
---
And? Double your attacks and make 15% of them miss. You're still ending up with a lot more attacks.
---
Omar Gonzalez, senior software engineer at Blizzard. He's a major contributor to the Classic WoW project. According to Ion Hazzikostas he was instrumental in making Classic run on the modern server architecture.
---
He also made a couple of in-game appearances during the stress tests.
---
Eh, August 27th is practically Spring lol.
---
Enjoy summer and then get lost in Azeroth haha.
---
Funny how that worked over the years, huh? Bag slots just kept becoming more and more accessible since Tailors had to make something with the new cloth, then the luxury bags were 2 extra slots.
---
Unfortunately dual wield shamans is not a thing in classic. I enjoyed it in cata, but I don’t remember exactly when they changed the enhancement tree to give it to them.
---
man, iv always wondered why its just human undead.
---
WoTLK is my favorite expansion. I dont think its bad by any means.
---
Could have sworn it was a few patches in before BC. I must be wrong
---
Thats talking about art assets not data.
---
You just said it yourself. People choose to use the dungeon finder and blast through those levels. Even after the entire world was redone with new interesting quests and storylines after cataclysm, many people still choose to blast through and not explore. People can choose to play how they want.
---
Boss does 50% the damage but parries 9% more. BAH GAWD!
---
Is it going to be lvl 60 before you get a mount again?
---
If you enjoy tanking, making calls and grouping up but don't want to commit to a guild or schedule then play a Paladin. You get a handful of options for PvE and PvP.
---
If you like tanking then a Pally can do any of the 5-10 man dungeons in Classic. Make a name for yourself as a good tank and you will get plenty of tells and messages.
---
So why is Classic not that? Or was the blue post wrong?
---
I love alliance bias
---
Warlocks were one of the classes that benefit the most from increased tank threat generation, they have no aggro drop or immunity, and their damage can be bursty with huge crit &amp; damage multipliers but very little hit early on. 
---
They're also one of the classes outside of the big 3 (warrior, rogue, mage) that are still considered pretty good in the modern "private server" meta, with admirable scaling, talent options that are decent in PvP and PvE and generally not to overcrowded (especially on alliance). 
---
If tank threat, due to high boss parry and various other inconsistencies with private servers, ends up one being very limited its might be a reason not to play what some are thinking of as a bit of a sleeper hit class.
---
Question: how doesn't it drive you nuts that all your keybinds are just randomly strewn all over the different bars like that? You're by no means the only example I've seen of this.
---
I like to have a list of keys I use plus shift and ctrl modifiers for all those keys - and keep them in a neat row stacked on top of each other so I always know how to set up my binds on a new char etc.
---
Maybe I'm just anal but doesn't the lack of organization cause issues?
---
was the gimmick where  you are nearly 90degrees  turned from target when  you cheap shot to avoid auto-attacking a PS trick?  I want to say i heard of it in 3.x live  but not sure.
---
Seems to be way more Horde on people in the actual beta. I'm not too concerned about Classic WoW's faction balance; I don't think it'll ever drop below a 55/45 split. 
---
If TBC Classic ever becomes a thing, thats when I would be concerned. Horde are just legitimately better in TBC, and on pservers the split can be as bad as 80/20.
---
\&gt;There were very few changes that made anything more difficult, the vast majority was to make things easier.
---
I don't think anyone's contesting that 1.12 classes and talents (and to some, but often exaggerated, degree items) are more powerful than their 1.1 counterparts. Basically all of the outrage of Classic being "too easy" has been about mob damage.
---
\&gt; Respawn timers nerfed in many dungeons, and had additional nerfs (Hp,  damage reductions etc.) likely to adjust for the new dungeon caps
---
This seems to be the only thing related to that on your list, and that patch AFAIK only affected high-level dungeons like Stratholme, Scholomance and BRD that were more commonly done by 10-player groups. \*And\* it was in patch 1.3 which was like three months after launch.
---
No aggro reducing abilities or talents. It sucks.
---
Seeing their foresight about how important it is to be picky with what you put in, and then hearing Kevin Jordan the other week talk about how seeing someone you don't even know, but if you're familiar with the game you can get an idea of who and what they are on the server just kind of made a light bulb go off in my head. 
---
I really disliked transmog cause it hurt that especially, but I also really really didn't like the idea of these allied races when that got announced for BFA. Adding 8 new playable races just really diluted the concept of "being somebody" down even further. We're at 21 playable races now, as opposed to the original 8. It was really easy back in the day to see a gnome you've never seen before in Ironforge by the mailbox and go, "ok he has a blue hood on, a stick for a staff, has arcane intellect buff, and I can hear him crafting something with cloth. He is probably a mid level mage working on his tailoring and coming up in the world." Then I'd see him again next week and recognize the name and see "wow he got the hood from SM Cath, good on him. he's comin up!" Nowadays you can't tell who the fuck anyone is or what they are and you're probably never going to see them again anyways so what does it matter. I know this is just one of many reasons why that is the way it is now, but the allied races just added to the problem and made it worse.
---
That's true. I'm really underestimating how long it's going to take. It's been so long.
---
Can you explain why you made a new account purely to post streamer's content?
---
Alliance. McConnell and I are going to be friends :)
---
What I'm saying is the hype already peaked and is on the decline, people are still interested in classic and are ready to play it on release, but google trends are down 19% and twitch avg viewer is down 10%
---
Wait stop there is no way this is real? How have I played this game for close to 12 years and didn’t know about this? Where is this? I played horde until cata if that matters?
---
What I was about to suggest as well.
---
Every aspect of wow classic is a pain in the ass. It's all about that time investment versus reward. Hunter is a pain because of ammo and food, warlock soulshards, paladin benedictions. The farming of mats the long walks slow mount. So if you try to find something easy and not painful. There you are looking for the wrong thing.
---
Man, when the classic community holds a grudge...
---
This was the first time teenage me had heard of WoW I remember that being among the stuff included with WC3 when I bought it. I was stoked to say the least.
---
Yay, I got that one before I quit. Luckily you don't need to get this one exalted. To get thru revered there is like, one single enemy in blasted lands that is on a 10 minute or so respawn that gives 1 single rep point. That's 146 days if you can go that long with sleeping more than 8-9 minute increments. And you have no other competition on server.
---
I suppose I just disagree.  Which single debuff is better than buffing every caster in your raid by a few %?  
---
You make it sound like nightfall is knocking off multiple.
---
Try them all imo. Play 19 till bored, go to 29 and do it again.
---
INT buff for all
---
It really is easy to spot it as exploiting if you can see the freaking unrendered zones of the world and it gives you a major advantage in the game.
---
I am INFJ advocate, but I will play a warrior. In all games I play warrior and nothing else.
---
Sure. The difference being, a disproportionately high number of Noobs this time around will be the self-entitled kind, uninterested and unwilling to take instruction or listen to suggestions. They will quickly Garner a reputation as such and will suffer.
---
thats not for the beta thats just the stress test fyi :/
---
No ChAnGeS!! /s
---
When the first mob you kill drops a 6-slot that toon feels blessed.
---
That is rediculous
---
Give me vanilla with tbc pve class balancing. Arenas were good too however they were poorly managed
---
I want a class that can roll need on every single weapon in the game with zero shame. That does low dps, that is totally disripected by the entire community but yet is very important to every aspect of the game, pve/pvp.
---
I like the people standing on the lamps on the sides to get better views
---
great photo
---
Horde have easier access to Scarlet Monastery and DM which are pretty popular dungeon. They also have an easier time getting to Naxx and AQ. Onyxia too I suppose.
---
Personally I think that Ironforge is still better, but Horde have some upsides location wise.
---
I click off the buffs just to be a dick.
---
-An undead rogue.
---
Yes I always felt Transmog was a participation trohpy for the people that had to get the gear when they could solo the raids lol
---
Was that a crack house? I wonder where he is now.
---
I hope they still do. Some people don't bother, but I would report every single person I saw doing this type of shit, and I don't plan on that changing lol
---
No windfury, check mate
---
Prot in vanilla (and TBC) is extremely slow to level.  You can't aoe kill things like you could in wrath or beyond, so you are still just sitting there killing 1-2 enemies at a time, but much slower. 
---
You can also tank as arms/fury in 5 mans and OT in raids.
---
I still remember after I found out you could get underneath the flag room... I immediately took my 19 mage, stuffed his bags full of feathers, grabbed the flag and slowfalled through the bottomless hole. Held the flag hostage for a good 2 or 3 hours before enough people quit to end the BG. Felt bad about but I had to try it once lol, poor bastards. Not sure how I didn't get banned for that one.
---
15 years ago I didn't label my character's main or alt, I just played what I wanted to play
---
Was the Lichking saronite bomb exploit ban unwarranted then? using bombs on the breaking areas made them come back so the valkyries just dropped people 5feet right back onto firm ground.
---
Made the fight much easier and the whole raid got banned using that exploit.
---
I'm not going to claim to be an expert on the numbers or theory crafting, but I will just say the idea of a main tank not using a shield back in Vanilla was akin to a rogue not using a weapon.  Like, just not even something worth discussing. 
---
The fact that now having to put a shield on for an **effing boss fight** is viewed as this encumbrance really does not seem accurate.
---
I mean earthstone, crafts. Dude just hotkey everything you're so lazy. Filty mouseclicker casul! Git gud.
---
Except that Rag is a gear check. Just like half the checks in classic. In the case it's FR gear.
---
 [https://www.wowhead.com/npc=64072/omar-gonzalez](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=64072/omar-gonzalez) 
---
He actually has an NPC as well in the current game.
---
Comparing 1 classes Fear Ward to the 5 classes Undead can be. Not even gonna continue reading.
---
The idea was that people would give some sort of idea of what they want from their chosen class in Classic, and we would help them narrow it down to one class.
---
But, if you're up for me to just choose everything for you I'm down to do that too. 
---
You seem like someone who likes a lot of different things, you've played both a caster and a melee character and said you liked both.
---
So, you're going to get to do both melee and ranged with your **Hunter**! As a Hunter, you will be able to level up quickly, which should help you keep up with everyone as a casual player. In keeping with the new experience theme, you'll be playing **Horde**. I'll leave the race up to you.
---
*tears*
---
Was in tbc
---
If it's released early, it would be after the name reservation date
---
I'm pretty sure they happen simultaneously. I think the most popular example is an interrupt vs Polymorph. They get batched together so they happen at the same time, but the effect is that the Mage gets locked out of that school, but the Warrior is still polymorphed. 
---
I'm not sure how it work in regards to absorption. I would think it would absorb the damage still if its happening simultaneously.
---
So, I'm a gladiator in arena as a warrior. I can tell you a thing or two about what an elemental shaman does and does not want. One thing they DO NOT want is for a melee dps to be in melee range. A few yards makes a big difference. It's an extremely valid concern to not want to be a tauren shaman due to hitbox size increase. You're not chasing after dudes in melee range, you're trying to stay safe so you can get casts off uninterrupted.
---
You're only being a dick to yourself though
---
You are completely missing the my point 
---
I'm not saying that Vanilla gear or any previous expansion gear was the pinnacle of effort and accomplishment but because there was no transmog you could tell by sight in an instant that a said player is a raider
---
In modern WoW that doesn't happen you could be in the best possible gear with the perfect stats and everything and I could pass right through you and never know because you are Transmoged in 5 year old gear 
---
and you could be in full greens or blues and be an absolute pleb by today's raiding standarts and still look cool and accomplished because you Transmoged to gear you facerolled 10 year old content
---
RemindMe! 120 days

Shadowburn shouldn't be used until the very end. Fireball has the lowest prio so it'll be kicked off immediately. Also there won't be fire mages for quite a while so scorch and ignite should be replaced by the frost debuff whose name escapes me atm. Thunderfury uses up two slots. Nightfall should be in there. Deep wounds will also be thrown off immediately. 
---
Then of course we have to make room for all the retarded hunters who put serpent sting up. Good lord I hope they won't follow to Classic.
---
Can we get a Information post on Omar? Like who is he and how he started or something? Would be awesome!
---
Faction quests give less rep the more over-leveled you are. So you have to pick and choose which quests and when to do them. Also, allied faction quests yield 25% rep to all other allied factions. So an Orgrimmar quest that gives 100 rep will also give you 25 rep to Thunder Bluff, Darkspears, and Undercity.

Gotta have them fresh timers

Classic spelling is back.

Why would his parents go to the news? I mean have you ever just tried sitting down with your kids...and beating them?
---
Jesus christ how is that even legal? If I had to spend 12 hours at work I'd resign immediately.
---
Whoa. 
---
Slippery slope there. What happened to “NO CHANGES MMMMAAAHHH”?
---
Never played hunter, but im pretty sure you can feed it the food that you would eat for yourself (to recover hp or mana). So most of the food is available for you at Inn vendors, of course depending on the pet you have, it may or may not eat certain types of food.
---
52/48 Horde favoured 4 hours later
---
You cant blink nades... only thing i can think of is he blinked on the same batch as the nade landing thus negating the nade. Didnt know you could do that though, might be a bug
---
Or don't be obstinate? I used Stoneform as another example. Nobody avoids rolling Rogue on Horde because Dwarves can counter bleeds and poisons. Nobody avoids, again, rolling Rogue on Alliance because of Orc stun resist. It's a nonsensical position that WotF affects Warlock or Priest populations in a comparable manner, and the direct weight of available evidence undermines that position.
---
It all happens at the same time
---
Oh the good old r/thedonald mod style. Sheesh
---
"i won't notice therefore nobody will" You sound like an idiot, mate. Nice memes instead of a rebuttal, though.
---
&gt;there are actually millions of people who enjoy retail WoW. 
---
DOUBT
---
See: Above
---
Arms is extremely easy to level.  Getting impale early makes having that occasional nuke that much more effective, and MS being based off of having a slower weapon rather than straight attack damage like BT means you will do more damage post 40 without the need for great gear. 
---
If your goal at 60 is to tank, and only tank, then being prot does make a huge difference.  Being able to have better burst threat and better TPS in general means 5 mans will be smoother no matter what.  Do you 'need' to be prot?  No.  But the difference is quite vast, if for no other reason than for the final few tiers of talents.
---
Only downsides for Paladin tanking in Classic is there isn't many defensive cds that don't lose your threat, as well as taunt for switching between MT/OT.
---
keep beating that drum
---
retail has been tanking hard for years
---
there arent a fraction of the number of players we had in bc/wrath, hell even Cata/MoP
---
19, young and spry but still legal
---
WoW's version of "God Ash" it seems.
---
Warlock
---
* All raid tier sets are awesome
---
* Tons of utility with Ritual of Summoning, Soulstone and Healthstone
---
* Easy to level and solo content with a voidwalker pet
---
* Scales well, DPS wise, especially into Naxx
---
I think the difference now isn't just raw damage, but spike damage.  A couple parrys in a row and the tank could be dead, that stuff isn't happening on private servers.
---
lol imagine writing all this thinking i would read it
---
The blue post was wrong.
---
Yes, it's part of the BfA client classic is based on
---
Same here. I had an alliance levelling route planned out to get exalted with darnassus by the time I was around level 40. Even tested it out to perfect it on private servers twice. Real bummer for me.
---
Have you given any consideration to Druid? It's the least played class, so you'd be pretty unique. They are pretty good in PVP and are the flag carriers of WSG, which can be fun. Feral is a nice damage spec. You'd be healing in raids most likely as Resto.
---
Ultimately, anyone who is trying to get gear for their offspec won't have priority in PVE, but you could always do PUGs or just get gear from PVPing if you're an intense PVPer.
---
We cleared the whole RFC with my group yesterday. Was EPIC !
---
My classes start a day before classic comes out. Priorities will have never been tested so hard.
---
Blessing of Kings and might
---
Yea maybe I have to watch him more. I just keep catching it in clips of him. For example in this clip, Omar is on his screen for like 10-15 seconds before he realizes it. Is he in this own little world, or just another time where he overlooked it?
---
Wow thanks never saw that. Didn't know there was land down there. I did the same thing with my mage but I didn't land on anything, just kept falling and casting slowfall with my bag full of feathers for the couple hours it took for everyone to quit lol.
---
As a shaman I always feel guilty when I get a random buff, because I have nothing to give back!
---
drinking a little to much of the asmond kool-aid
---
Isn't Alliance still more popular till this day? I mean come one who doesn't want to play a dwarf or an elf it's like the bread and butter of all fantasy characters. Orcs and trolls are always being depicted as super dumb. Then you have Taurens, I mean cows.... And well thankfully the undead who will bring the total horde population higher.

Is true. If they release classic I'll pay for it. If they don't release tbc or wotlk eventually after it, I'll go back to pirating the game lol.
---
Sounds like the classic wow I remember!  The 2nd question in our guild recruitment interviews was "Do you stand in fire often?"
---
I wouldn't necessarily *not* call it loot.
---
Mages usually top the damage charts for casters in PVE and PVP. They are needed in raids and usually like 5-7 mages are brought along. They can level and make gold very fast by AOE farming mobs. Additionally, they have good utility in the form of free food/water and portals. Moving around the world is also fun with Blink and Slow Fall.

It's the class I'm going to play, and I suggest you do the same.

yall realise Jay doesnt care though, right? guy is sitting in the throne. for everyone that 'do' his bonus gets a little bigger. it is in his interest to have been wrong.
---
WoW has the benefit of already having existing content to roll out though, OSRS was their only backup of the entire game from that era so if they wanted more content the only choice was to make new stuff. I think it's much more likely we will see TBC servers open up post-naxx
---
As long as aggro radius doesn't change, then you will be able to farm mara like before.
---
If you do happen to do another test run on the next stress test - will you please record it and upload it to youtube? I find it much easier to follow along than the spreadsheet
---
Not to mention he was playing the game the only reason he started even attempting that jump was because a mage (who had done the jump)  was essentially going to gold the wsg hostage. But yes lets blame soda for this.
---
Don’t you spawn the rake with the horn? You can probably have 20 up at the same time.
---
&gt;Faction quests give less rep the more over-leveled you are.
---
I'm pretty sure this stopped being true during vanilla, and has been proven as such in the beta.
---
I hope, it's a good feeling seeing someone play a game for the first time, I wish I could relive that here.

Can somebody explain why these flags have the ugly white square in the middle of the top? The Horde one does too.
---
You'll have a lot more fun lvling your warrior directly. And participate in a lot of dungeons along the way. It's not all about the lvl 60 remember wow was actually fun and rewarding to just play at any lvl.
---
I change my mind daily, though usually wanting to stick with RSham cause that's what I played.  
---
I would prefer to PvP and heal. Like being more utility, and defensive play.
---
They must all be streamers
---
I'm thinking Warlock is the choice for you. 
---
They have imo the best looking gear in the game. They are one of the fastest levelers in the game. They have great utility in the form of summoning and health/soulstones. They are very independent and can grind alone with their pet tanking. And their DPS is top tier in the later raids once they are geared.
---
Heeey I'm in the pic! :D woohoo!
---
Hi, /u/demobay, your post has been removed as it is seems to be talking about the current stress test. Please use the current [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bui555/stress_test_2_the_megathread_of_omg_why_can_i_not/) instead.
---
IMO that’s conservative for blizzards past, but I guess risky for most game producers
---
fixed!
---
Love UC and TB shame it's not busier.
---
LOLOL I was in this pic too I had fun today with you guys :) See you at the next one! Maybe we'll learn how to run our summoning circle by then XD
---
You will eventually when doing 2men DM:E runs or 5men strat:live reserving orbs carrying level 58 to green geared 60s through the dungeon. 
---
A t1/2/2.5 geared warrior can survive quite some time between each heal when max rank is used so with some coordination it becomes incredibly efficient to not wait for everyone having 100% mana every single time.
---
When grinding dungeons for gold time is literally money.
---
took some screenshots of the final moments in the latest stress test and mashed em together to share with you all!
---
No, the guy simply had no idea what walljumping is. Walljumping was the ability to climb on *nothing*, on a nearly vertical surface, constantly. You could scale the entirety of Hyjal from *anywhere* using walljumping, so long as you don't screw up. That was walljumping, and it's no longer a thing.
---
"this is why we can't have nice things" monkaW
---
Yes.  Mentioned in the wow diary.  They got scrapped for reasons, one being the animation of them slithering wouldn’t have made the deadline to paraphrase.
---
That would be sweet. I'll have to look into that. Got any sources?
---
I’d rather them just make new content, vanilla style, without the raising the level cap.
---
Also 39 because it's the highest you get without mounts. This is where you will see people making full use of alchemy and engineering.
---
bruh this was so hard for a dumb ass like me
---
Player B absorbs player A's damage.
---
Self casts works differently AFAIK.
---
FAIL
---
In premades there's no way UD rogue beats Orc, literally no fear will last a duration. Stun resist is 100% better. Stop being dumb.
---
Dwarfs is the superior spelling due to Warhammer Fantasy having the superior dwarfs.
---
Did Bolvar help this time, or is he still bugged?
---
Dunno why but thought it would be Chris Metzen streaming :( I’d watch the shit out of that tbh. 
---
Playing classic and just explaining story points or anything really as he goes along.
---
It’s not
---
27 hopeful Hordeadins
---
I love Shamans and sticking with RSham wouldn't be a bad move at all.
---
If you're looking for something new, though, Priest could be a good choice. Shadow Priest is very strong in PVP, and Priests are often called the best healers in the game. If you want to play more defensively you could always go Holy and support the team.
---
Also Priests have Mind Control, and MCing someone off a cliff to their death is extremely satisfying.
---
there are more horde than ally on the beta realms though..
---
Blizz didn't think they could make Classic work again which is why they hadn't ever done it. But Omar came up with the idea to try to put the old data on the modern client - and then further spent a few weeks apparently locking himself away until he figured out how to make it happen, which is how the Classic project truly started at Blizz.
---
Without Omar Classic wouldn't have happened.
---
Dang I remember this. Honestly I had forgot about it. Talk about a trip down memory lane.
---
You can't argue there is more complexity in vanilla versus retail in class design. Change my mind.
---
I think something like WildStars (RIP) housing system would work just fine, and it’s strikingly similar to the basic idea of Garrisons, with a set of plots you could put buildings on, but also free-form props and changeable interior and floor textures.
---
And again, housing is just an example of a system people would be interested in. The main point would be creating a way old content could be relevant again, based mostly on systems the game already has access to.
---
And TBH, a ton of other MMOs have done it and done it well or at least interestingly.
---
Rift, LOTRO, Runescape, FFXIV, Ultima Online...
---
In fact, as far as housing in MMOs goes, I feel like WoW is probably one of the few to manage to screw it up somehow.
---
I’ve been playing this game for over a decade and I still get lost in there sometimes. Or can’t find the tunnel exit you can fly out of.
---
Form a pentagram!? A pentagram you say? The horde can’t even read or write, what is this nonsense!
---
Would that make him..... Gosh?
---
It would piss off all of the people who took off work for Classic release. No way they would do that.
---
Damn that sucks. No worries. As long as it comes sometime in classic I'll be happy lol.
---
Keep it up!
---
Loch Modan is one of my favorite zones. I can't wait to take the flight path over the dam again.
---
Thank you!  
---
Yeah just too much love for RSham, but wanting to try something new. Loved Priests from BC-Live so maybe I'll give it a go first this time. :)
---
Everyone I know returning is over 30, most with kids. The thing is, we all think everyone is like us, which isn't really the case. I would guess there will be plenty over 30, but more in their 20's or late teens.
---
I ended up spending a lot of time up in Loch Modan because I stumbled into the Deeprun Tram and came to the personal conclusion that Dwarf Zones&gt;Human Zones. Still never knew about that goddamn hunting lodge until years later. 
---
Out of all the places destroyed by Cata: that one hit hardest.
---
There's a /sw feature in retail? Never knew that existed.
---
I want to make rogues scream. I want to make their backstabbing dreams fall to pieces. I want them to suffer.
---
Omar Gonzalez, the dev who figured out how to get Vanilla data to run on the modern client, thus paving the way for Classic to become a reality.
---
I'm not sure if this is indeed the case but I've been told AoE effects are not effected by the hitbox meaning stuff like Frost Nova, CoC, Blizzard etc. do not hit tauren easier than other races.
---
if this is true, it really only affects max range casting which already happens rarely enough.
---
No. Just pick what you like. Honestly.
---
He works 4 days on and 4 days off? I know a lot of people that would prefer to stay longer at work for more days free of work.
---
Personally I'm ok with my 5 day a week, 7.5h days but if I had the option to have 4 days in a row off to then work 12 hours a day for 3 or 4 days a week I'd probably take it.
---
Rogues destroyed hunters in 29
---
Every Monday this subreddit has recruitment threads. 
---
Post in the WoW Classic forums.
---
Make a guild discord. 
---
Etc.
---
2.0, which is the patch that changed everything to prep for BC.
---
What? What are you even talking about? I said that *Alliance* doesn't avoid rolling Rogues or using them in premades because of the Orc stun resist passive, even though in the aggregate it can matter a lot in PvP scenarios. You seem to think that specifically the subsection of players who exclusively PvP in premades is somehow large enough to affect server balance as a whole. Alliance and Horde do not have meaningful population differences in their Priest and Warlock ranks. Again, this is easily accessible by Googling it, and I would link it for you if AutoMod didn't remove any post with links to those stat pages.
---
You're claiming one race's on-cooldown racial ability, WotF, somehow meaningfully decreases the number of "countered" classes on the other faction. I'm saying that that doesn't happen, that clear pserver statistics prove this, and that nobody argues the same thing about other analogous "counter-racials" like Stoneform, so it's farcical to assert otherwise. Alliance *will* have Warlocks and Priests, and they'll be just as bountiful as Horde's Warlocks and Priests.
---
Play what you want. Not every guild is going to be super hardcore and only rake "viable specs". My Vanilla guild had an Enhancement Shaman without Nightfall and we still cleared MC/BWL.
---
That's eechayakee or whatever that you spawn with the horn
---
PVP boys.
---
Whatever happened to Varimathras in the retail story line?  I must have missed when Nathanos all of a sudden replaced him.
---
Spell ranks are something you have to take into account. As a priest, you can't just spam the highest rank greater heal for example. You might have to cast rank 1 for set bonus procs or rank 5 for efficiency.
---
You have 51 talents to distribute too, instead of six. 
---
I think in some ways, such as these, it has more complexity. I'm sure there's plenty more but this is the top of my head.
---
I see where you are coming from. 
---
They made excellent titles no dispute. D2, BW, and WoW were masterpieces. I also feel that Overwatch was a masterpiece, even if it died down. 
---
You have to remember that every blizzard game which was considered great was an iteration on a previous title. People remember Brood war, not the original. People remember WC3 not 1 or 2. People remember Lord of Destruction, not diablo 1 or diablo II. 
---
Overwatch is the one title they got it right the first time it reached customers hands.
---
And dual wield.
---
Fortunately that's not the case.
---
Human lands were furthest from the Scourge's center of power so they're what broke off from the Lich King's will.
---
(pulled that out of my ass: I have no idea)
---
19 was a bit boring, 29 was fun, 39 was fun but not quite as fun as 29.  29 was fun in tbc too because of the item level 35 requirement for enchants.  49 and 59 I never got, it's too close to 60 talent wise to choose it over pvp at 60.
---
I hope he prints this and hangs it in his office
---
&gt; Felt like there wasn't any longevity in the private servers and I think it ended up getting wiped or something a bit later.
---
Yeah that's exactly what always stopped me from investing any serious time into a private server. I played them a few times and had fun, but it just felt like there was no point putting the effort into a character that's gonna be deleted within a year or two
---
I haven’t played since vanilla, but I am definitely back for this.  The nostalgia is strong.
---
Go
---
It's really more about gear and enchants available.  In vanilla it was imba, tbc fixed that somewhat.
---
Raiding is maybe 15-25% of your playtime in an organized guild.
---
Go for warrior!  
---
I for one do not like raids to begin with but by being fury I get quite alot of juicy plate DPS gear.
---
You can now be a dedicated dungeon runner to gear newcomers to your guild as a 2hand wielding tank slashing is way through dungeons with infinite rage, sweeping strikes if you are PvP spec, cleaves, whirlwinds never running out of juice. twoshotting clothie dungeon elites because of glorious cleave + whirlwind + sweeping strikes is just mesmerizing and you will be coming back simply just for fun. Most fun I've ever had in PvE. Raiding is nothing compared to it.
---
the more gear you have, the more fun dungeons become as 2hand fury warrior tank.
---
Got blamed for the wrathgate and killed by alliance+horde IIRC
---
I wouldn't pick mining and herb, because if I remember right you can't track both at the same time.
---
The guy who made classic possible.
---
Make it clear the standards you are personally going to play up to, only invite people who also play at those standards
---
Basically what I'm saying is step 1 is taking the initiative and start recruiting. 
---
All you need to raid is a well balanced group of 40 people (more difficult than it sounds). 
---
Leading a guild is a much larger ordeal than just being in one, but it starts with recruitment.
---
I never suggested picking up both. You always take Skinning.
---
you can clearly see party health values in screenshot 4 but can't on the beta
---
Warning to others - this is a 45 min video you're going to want to watch as soon as you click it. Do yourself a favor and don't click until you have time. RIP my bedtime.
---
Even before there was an AH there, it's where I always hung out. Shit is the best.
---
If you type the name of a unit after your emote, it will target that unit. 
---
i.e. /ty nakknudd
---
Something I do is to just keymash wildly after an emote. It can't find a target so it will do a neutral emote. 
---
It's not elegant, but it lets me keep fighting the mob I'm targetting without fuss.
---
Thanks for linking this, really awesome seeing these developers from back then. Will watch him when he’s live.
---
This is one thing that will def be different in Classic than Vanilla.  RIght from the outset, guilds will know they will need 8 tanks at some point.  They will be gearing and preparing their Warriors accordingly.
---
I’m only going to really miss dual spec and guild banks, as well as larger bag sizes. 
---
Transmog - part of the classic experience was seeing people in the gear they’d earned. It’s the one QoL I wouldn’t mind seeing, but it’s not happening. 
---
Flying - part of Vanillas immersion was the fact that you’re on the ground, travel wasn’t trivial, and in Pvp servers, had to be calculated carefully. The world just feels more alive. 
---
Sharding/Layering - just search this sub for that one and you’ll see. One of the biggest immersion breakers in retail WoW.
---
LFR/LFG - community made WoW. Interacting with others instead of pressing a button to join an anonymous raid, then walking into the raid and killing the bosses together required communication, coordination, and built reputations and relationships. When was the last time you made a friend in LFR? Or even talked to someone? It’s not a common occurrence. 
---
By the way, it’s perfectly okay to like retail WoW. It’s also okay to like classic the way it comes packaged. I’m probably too casual to raid much in classic, but I’m going to have a great time leveling, doing professions, and pvping. I’ll also continue having fun raiding in retail. Classic is win/win.
---
optimal builds are based around doing what is obviously good, things aren't going to change dramatically regardless of how much that upsets you
---
Some of those close up massive crowded shots gave me gamescom flashbacks. Personal space rocks
---
He was likely reading his chat on another screen
---
Temporary curiosity may not be a sign of long term success, but long term success sure is a sign of long term success.  Sometimes I wonder if people have forgotten that WoW literally did nothing but gain players for four years, with many staying for most or even all of those four years, and then some.  
---
This isn't a brand new, unproven game.  We KNOW it was an excellent game, it succeeded immensely before, and I would bet hard money it will do so again.
---
Not this hunter they didn’t.
---
High Elves were playable in part of the campaign too.
---
Too much "downvote because I disagree, not because it's a poor post" in this thread.
---
In some PvP videos (remember those?), like [Vurtne Frost Mage PvP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh_cLN66zHA), the player would mouse over each of their items and show its stats. In [Gegon : New Ability !](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WhEMCOAMu8&amp;t=2m20s), the player simply shows the visual appearance of each piece of gear. Of course it doesn't show items like rings or necklace, but I think it is very effective in showing the average quality of gear the player has.
---
Now, in actual PvP, some people might have their cameras zoomed out so far that characters take up as much screen space as "a Marine in Starcraft", as Blizzard memorably put it. You don't always have time to look closely at what someone is wearing.
---
But muh layering
---
Hi, /u/LockedUPeggers26
---
It's really not complicated. All you have to do is play a shit ton, and then make friends and get other people to play with you that also play a shit ton.  
---
Really though you need a big dose of reality, because you're aren't magically going to form a #1 server guild overnight and just recruit random noobs to clear MC to getting server first c'thun/KT. One step at a time little fella.
---
The shield slam buff used to be a big topic of discussion around here. Kind of been forgotten but if there is one ability id like to see changed to a pre 1.12 state it would be this.
---
it REALLY depends on how busy your server is, if anyone is levelling enchanting they will want the mats and those are generally quite pricey on the AH, and the gear on the AH also make it cost prohibitive...levelling crafting is also a fairly lengthy process and you will at some point (maybe several times) be struggling to get those last few points before you can learn a new recipe.
---
&gt; Its kind of stupid to say its not gonna have an affect on their sub count.
---
I literally did not say that.
---
I played horde on retail, and then I tried out alliance on PS and I'm never going back. Horde raiding is a pain in the dick, and PvPing against Paladins is also a pain in the dick.
---
So I'm going ally.
---
Even if you do PvP it’s perfectly fine, and rep grinding PvP factions faster can give an early edge. Sure, gnomes are better with racials and the lower profile can actually matter, but it’s not like picking human totally invalidates you in PvP.
---
Hahahahaha Hahahaha the amount of times I’ve tanked this. I miss my bear bleezie. Just a rag tag Druid. Half pvp gear half PvE rolling around as a NAture swiftness feral build. 
---
Timing that NS when a healer was under a spell was the best. Gonna have to look into this vanilla shenanigans. 60 was my favorite play. BC was ok @70.
---
 after I realized they changed the spec tree format when I wanted to try panda I was totally lost. To tough to re-learn after 100+ playing days at 60. FFS took me 20 days to hit 60 and it was great. I lived at Wailing caverns lol healer, tank, or  damage whatever you want!
---
But would they die to a crushing blow and parry hasted crit back to back?  Because thats going to be happening much more often.
---
I think it's perfectly possible for them to release sooner. There's really not that many things to test. It's not a new game anyways.
---
But since they already officially announced the date... they won't do it sooner even if they were going to sit on their hands for two months.
---
Maybe WoW could do with a new expansion that’s separate from the game. Every time an expansion hits, it’s a new game. Not sure if that helps solve the problem.
---
Private server?
---
As a leveling warrior, I find this statement completely false.
---
True, but this also means healers more or less have to be spam healing to ensure they get a heal before that 1.5 sec window closes.  This is going to make mana much more of an issue for healers.
---
Thanks :) 
---
Ohh twinking! Another thing I miss about classic
---
I feel like that is a valid contribution. :) It's a positive interaction, and I found myself sorely missing small kindnesses like that when I played BFA for a short while.
---
I didn’t get a bag but I found a chest with a pair of potions in it. Saved my life like 5 minutes later when I accidentally pulled an extra mob with around half mana and again later. Then I got some more items like reduce armor and something else plus I can get some rockets from the sw candle delivery which are like an extra judgement.
---
Does anyone know if you are supposed to get an HK just for just being in a raid? Without having to deal any damage to an enemy. I know xp is shared for monster kills without dealing damage but getting HK shares seems strange, cant remember if thats how it worked in vanilla. Did it work the same in AV?
---
If blizzard ever does an experimental server, sure, i'd be all for it. However keep that filth out of my classic
---
For first three days
---
Yeah I'd love to see all the scrapped content ideas from vanilla finally get to see the light of day, just don't have my hopes up too high
---
Human paladin.
---
Lets just hope theyre working on a dope new mmo that will come out in 3 or 4 years when everyones cleared it all in classic!
---
Raid with casuals.  Kick anyone from your guild who even remotely has an idea how to raid.  There's some challenge for you.
---
Saying that blizzard is being passive aggressive by making people pay for sub completely wrong and cynical. The sub is to access the game completely period..
---
yes i feel the same, maybe the could make them on a separate server
---
And any raid content is as difficult as you make it based on how much you choose to prepare and gear beforehand
---
I should look through my old hard drives when I go back home and see if any of my old screenshots are saved. I had a folder of thousands of screenshots from 2005 until 2009ish somewhere.
---
Yeah I've gone back through the patch notes and can't see it mentioned anywhere.
---
There's been so many things in pservers that have seemed wrong to me that classic has shown to be wrong, but this wasn't one of them and I was a chronic altoholic in vanilla. 
---
 It's amazing how easily memory can be altered.
---
Uh huh.  What was your secret, how did you beat rogues.
---
Speaking of filth. Gotta love that PS server toxicity leaking all over /r/classicwow
---
This speaks to me.. i might play a druid in classic!
---
My guess would be that there would be most alliance on PVE realms and most Horde on PVP realms
---
I think overall there will be more horde, by a few %, because a lot started playing in TBC or later, where blood elves were very popular, so I think a big part of them will stay horde
---
Totally won't be incredibly cancerous and unfun.
---
It's the Northern boarder of Loch Modan. OP is in Wetlands looking South.
---
Do you go to the Great Forge very often?
---
Oh, what am I saying. Of course you don't.
---
Nice. Spite is so much more satisfying when it isn't the default interaction, which it feels like in modern.
---
Just seeing this increases my heart rate
---
Where can I get some dam bait?
---
He was reading his chat. One of the things I really like about the guy is how hard he tries to respond to the things individual people say in chat, instead of making people pay for a donation to get his attention.
---
Part of me is sad that he probably won't be able to keep it up with how fast his channel is growing.
---
Sounds like TBC to me. Yes please!
---
I don't think anyone would disagree with you - for the private server meta.  Classic WoW uses different numbers than private so the PS meta data can largely be thrown out.
---
It's a special game!
---
Haha, good one.
---
I want to solo as much as possible.
---
Shit like that is how the great Tarren Mill-Southshore wars started, some of the most epic world PvP ever. PvP servers have their ups and downs my friend.

Hitboxes in vanilla are pretty large, with the internet back then it was needed. Thats why grenades have such a large hit range too.
---
“I thought I didn’t, but I do”
---
Ur the toxic one trying to destroy the best game ever
---
I mean thats u so
---
I’m planning on playing a protection warrior at release! I’ve never actually played wow before in any shape way or form. What buffs can I give strangers passing by??
---
Wow has always been a game of progression. This is a strange mindset.
---
I think that's the most elegant thing I've heard since 4pm this afternoon
---
If it’s anything like vanilla wow, many guilds will fall apart after molten core. BWL killed many raiding guilds on my server but from those raiding guilds who broke up, new more hardcore guilds were created from the top raiders.
---
I would suggest you try to be raid ready as soon as possible after launch. Make it into a raiding guild and you will quickly find other raiders who are wanting to push as hard as you. Once you have a good core you can create your own. 
---
Many of the first guilds will end up merging with other guilds to consolidate good members and push content.
---
Just out of curiosity, where are you getting the numbers for beta Naxx bosses?  Last I had seen the level cap was 30.
---
My best advice to you is **DO NOT DO IT**. The reality of running a raid group, especially in vanilla, is that your better players are going to be poached non stop. 1-5 Guilds at the top are going to soak up the majority of talent on a server, and the good players you pick up are looking to prove themselves so they can get into the better guild. 
---
I have been in your situation in Mortal Online, WoW Retail, Darkfall, New World, Eve online etc. If your group isnt competing then there is nothing you can do to keep good players, and boosting up noobs is not a winning strategy. Starting fresh you dont have a chance to compete with incoming retail, private server, and beta guilds.
---
BUT. If you ignore this advice
---
&gt;However I can't really seem to find any guides on creating a guild from scratch.
---
Basically very few people ever start from scratch, and nobody wants to be the first. You gota start by being the annoying guy who makes the cold call. Message people who arent in guilds, give them your vision, and if you're good at that you'll start picking people up. If you're not getting anyone then try different approaches.
---
And how am I doing that?
---
Technically you're right aside from Gnomes having Human units, (namely the Gyrocopter in RoC, Flying Machine in TFT), but playable Undead in WoW aren't really like the Undead race from WC3 either and anyone expecting such would have been disappointed.
---
The Undead in WC3 are the Scourge, complete with death knights, liches, the nathrezim and nerubians, necromancy, ghosts, and all sorts of monstrosities and constructs. The only time we got to play as them in WoW was in WotLK's death knight starter zone.
---
The Undead in WoW are based off of Sylvanas' faction from the campaign. If another race had been in their place, it still would have made sense, since the Forsaken are pretty different and still wouldn't get to play as the Scourge anyway.
---
Man imagine if real world followed fantasy architecture rules and on Hoover Dam there'd this fifty fucking meter high face of Hoover himself
---
Yes, because Horde is busy pwning alliance ass
---
There is a school of thought within the PS community that a naked mace wielding priest is actually the optimal main tank for a progression guild.
---
Original WoW didn't show the health of enemies, although addons could quickly estimate it based on damage taken. Of course, this goes against the argument that "no transmog is better because it lets you estimate enemy power and knowing enemy power is good".
---
But I don't really care about that. WoW classic does not have transmogrification, modern WoW does. I'm here to say this:
---
A [naked mage could really be naked, or could be wearing a frost reflect trinket, and you'd have no idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh_cLN66zHA&amp;t=16m39s).
---
As is the idea that only AQ can be somewhat challenging.
---
You don't know what the fuck your talking about
---
During vanilla the view distance was very small for seeing other players.
---
Good luck finding a group together level with without lfg
---
None, unfortunately. You have to be in a group to share Battle Shout, it requires rage, and only lasts a couple of minutes. 
---
Your contributions to the world will come via tanking dungeons and raids. :)

Spell ranks filled out the skill bar to hide the uselessness of some spells. Shit even modern wow has to some extent included this by making a fast inefficient heal and a slow but efficient heal. You chose efficiency: you at tops maybe kept three ranks of specific spell on your bar depending on class. The only time this wasn't true was rank 1 arcane explosion which dealt 0 dmg to rogues at 60 but broke stealth. Talents have been cookie cutter since the beginning it's the appearance of choice but in reality there is a right way and a wrong way to put your talents in. 
---
You could argue that well you also had to pay attention to threat which is a valid arguement  which spawned the skittish affix in m+ but it's a slippery slope if I include specific examples. You still need to pay attention to aggro in big fights due to adds because with the reduction in useless abilities you can focus more on game mechanics and positioning. 
---
You could say there were tons of unique consumables that did things that made every profession important. None however impact the mechanics of a fight in a meaningful way that isn't replicated in live right now to my knowledge. 
---
I hold the opinion personally at a very base level vanilla is the better game due to the wider appearance of choice. That said to say vanilla was more complex when the most complex fight in vanilla is 4 horseman versus say king rastakhan a very middle of the road fight in modern day mechanics is disingenuous of the product and the hard work the devs put in.
---
End rant
---
The China farmer corpse were always funny :D they did advertising in major cities! 
---
I don’t know if they did that in classic as well. 
---
https://www.joystiq.com/2007/07/05/gnome-corpse-advertisement-in-wow-by-gold-farmers/
---
Hunters mark if able obviously. Detect invis potions. Timely use of feee action potions. Engineering roots and stuns helped. Plus honestly most people didn’t play them that great. Tons of rogues rolled Twink rogue cause they thought it was op. Most didn’t know the class great. Even if I couldn’t kite them I was often able to with a pet melee them rather successfully if they didnt chunk me to badly when jumping me. Butcher plus scouts blade with 15 agility’s on them rip. Main thing to do is not put yourself in a situation to be ganked by a rogue. With no support or let yourself be unaware of the possibility. It’s fairly easy to avoid an unwinnable situation by moving correctly and staying mobile
---
Would be nice if they pinned that thread. It's buried by Tuesday usually, unfortunately. Monday and Tues morning are really the only time I personally see any hits from it.
---
Damn okay, share I can’t help out the random passerby. Cheers!
---
He's talking about database data it says so right on the slide lol. That whole section was all on source code.
---
&gt;Fuck with me
---
Eh there are certain ages and body temperature levels below which you shouldn't go
---
I remember farming the water elemental, for 2 epic mounts (essence of water was selling for 10g back then), for the "hide of the wild" of my shaman, etc
---
And I remember falling once when running back to my corpse, near the horde camp, directly into the elf zone below (duskwood?). It took ages to come back afterwards!
---
That’s not really a reasonable definition of “viable”.  If you’re able to do 99.7% of the dps requires, that’s fine. That’s easily within the margin of error, and other stronger specs will make up for your (very very slight) shortcomings. 
---
Now, if you’re doing 299 dps while everyone else 1200, and 1000 is required, then sure, the group still succeeds since everyone else covers for you, but you clearly aren’t viable unless you’re somehow bringing a shit ton of utility. 
---
The exact line is subjective, of course, but there will always be a bit of variance between classes and specs (assuming equal gear and skill). A couple of percent difference between dps isn’t a dealbreaker for determining viability. Nothing in WoW, and especially classic, is THAT tightly tuned.
---
Highly recommend it. Great class, severely underrated. Your dps isn’t great but if you learn the class you can pull your weight
---
this comment me laugh so hard i could barely type a response.  yikes!
---
Lol don't gear up 5head. Wow isn't like totally about that 5head.
---
Why moving counter-clockwise? My OCD is killing me! :P
---
It also means more times your threat dump is getting parried which on doesnt refund rage I don't think
---
I used to always do all of my business in TB during vanilla because my trash computer couldn’t handle all the people in Org XD

Addons are the heart of vanilla so stop complaining and just download one if you really want to know. Debuff timers.
---
It's pretty dope that they are unique.
---
 I've never understood why newer games did not include flavor skills like wow did. Things like levitate, slow fall, mind vision, etc. These skills were not game breaking but add some much more fun and uniqueness to the classes.
---
He created WoW so he´s the official deity if this world. The othr devs are lesser gods.
---
It’s like old school runescape, but for wow lol
---
Wow someone disagreed with my opinion, better make a toxic post about how toxic this subreddit is
---
I am the same. I would rather have a remastered version of WoW with a new name (New Game) instead of classic released as is. Take classic and BC and bring it to the future without the bad habbits. Take Classic leveling, BC class design, BC loot system, Legion M+ and BFA Raids, tier sets, Stats that matter.
---
 Get rid of LFG, LFR, basically any quick que system that got rid of the social aspect, WF, TF.
---
I prolly missed a list of things but I don't wanna be here for weeks remembering them. Don't get me wrong, I am gonna play classic while wishing for BC, but I would rather them the balls to make the best of both worlds.
---
If you feel there should be a discussion about changes in classic wow then you clearly don't understand the point of classic wow. Sorry you are the underwhelming minority who wants changes to the game.
---
/sit has been tested on beta to not generate rage.
---
The 100% 0changes people are the same that will download questie even before login in
---
We don't talk about that here.
---
I played a lot of rogue in vanilla and the 3.x patches and I do not remember this ever being a thing on live that could generally be reproduced.  I've seen people claim it works/worked on retail but I'm fairly sure all opener's break stealth regardless of whether you auto attacked after.  
---
For example there was [this trick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klMsyF_Kz5o) to sap and then cheapshot for CP's without breaking stealth.  This let you start a fight with 2/3/5 cps (With premed) and full energy while the target was still sapped, along with enough time for your Cheap shot DR to wear off.  
---
But to pull this off you obviously can't attack otherwise it would break stealth.  
---
[Pretty sure this video is the trick regarding angles you're talking about, and it's clear that things like Garrote/Cheap Shot break stealth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uokbqCLghbs).
---
For real, any changes to it and it would no longer be classic WoW.
---
It's hard to take these statistics serious without more information. I'm 99% certain that the 1% number includes ALL accounts. It's pretty much the same as in Path of Exile. According to the devs, only a fraction reaches endgame. Probably fits the number if you consider that according to steam achievements, less than 50% ever reach the first harder boss (brutus) that veterans reach in an hour of gameplay.
---
I'd be interested in a number of players that at least reached max level. But well, in the end everyone pays his sub, so I can see how everyone matters for that.
---
Our big Omar can beat your flying ZP anytime :P
---
Outside of Stromgarde, tomorrow, with everyone watching
---
Those aren't hunter abilities. Anyone can fap, net or nade. Rogues for example.  Everything you listed is zero sum because every twink will have them.
---
No, in Onslaught's loot list, attendance barely has an effect and bringing consumable and performance have no effect because they're expected. With identical lists and even marginally similar attendance, you'll end up rolling and the loser will have a much higher priority the next time it drops.
---
Yes that will for sure show them...!
---
$$$$$$$$$
---
Sssh, be quiet. This amazing suggestion might be heard by the #NOCHANGESLMAO crowd
---
^^^ so many of the questions are objectively meaningless, like they use such squishy words that you can choose to interoperate them in any way you like. 
---
"It is sometimes OK to step on people to get ahead"   
---
are they asking morally? legally? the way things ARE? the way you believe they SHOULD BE?  how often is "sometimes" and what exactly does "Step on" mean?  
---
"In my team building exercise sometimes we make human pyramids to overcome obstacles, and then we reach back down to help the last few over!  So clearly I step on people to get ahead sometimes."
---
Good luck getting server first anything when every server is going to have ex private server players who have stuck together after 2 or more servers, and consistently being the best guilds on the server :(
---
And theres still 30 more levels of testing to go
---
I see it like smashing a gift on the ground. They spent time, mana, and thoughtfulness only to see the dick rogue lose the buff. 
---
The way I see it, it makes a memory, where as 99.9% of other players would just be like "thanks d00d."
---
Well, when you do 400 dmg crit in deadmines, the tank has a hard time getting all that aggro back.
---
Obtuse complaints deserve obtuse Solutions. :D
---
I always switch blessings to the 'wrong' one if they don't return the buff. I feel like that's in the pally handbook somewhere.
---
I just want to say, its awesome to have a 700 comment discussion...about the actual game.  Debating strategy, specs, gear, raid comp.  Its awesome.  Modern WoW only gets threads like this to bitch about something.
---
You're asking how a healing class can level/kill mobs solo?
---
Every class has an universal set of skills they learn by paying Trainers for them, and every caster has some offensive/protective skills. So even if you're fully specced for healing, you're still able to blast mobs from afar, just slightly less effectively than someone specced for blasting.
---
I'm confused by a few things:
---
1.) What gave you the impression that you were in a subreddit about a game that needs to be changed? Classic is meant to be a fairly faithful recreation of Vanilla so you're kind of in a vegan subreddit talking about burgers. 
---
2.) Why do you think the people here should be interested in sharing your delusion? These are exciting times and there is a lot to talk about. Vandalizing a potentially great game doesn't seem like something that people are going to go for.
---
Based Omar and his ability to say nah I can do this when everyone else say no
---
Humans, dwarves, gnomes,
---
Orcs, Trolls, Tauren,
---
Night Elves, Naga, Blood Elves,
---
Forsaken
---
If WoW were ever to restart from scratch with lore-sound factions I'd say this makes the most sense.  The Blood Elves and the naga who follow Lady Vashj were aligned with Illidan, who became an ally of the Night Elves at the end of Warcraft 3. That is, if they were to retcon Illidan to be alive again.  
---
Forsaken don't make sense with any of the other factions.  They could be given different undead races to make up for it, such as banshee, ghoul, or undead versions of other playable races.  
---
Actual WoW factions make absolutely no sense.  Night Elves being aligned with the Alliance is a big stretch, Forsaken being horde is highly questionable, and Blood Elves being horde is laughable.
---
Mining and skinning with a warrior. The skinning is for some extra silver during leveling, and the mining ores I will gather on a bank-alt and level engineering when I hit level 60.
---
Redundant skills most people hated having to swap aren’t fun. 
---
I think you’re in the wrong about FF. I’m excited for the changes and reworks. Especially with dark knight and machinist. 
---
To each their own, but normalization has to happen somewhere otherwise it’s impossible to balance.
---
where's waldo
---
The slow stealth animation was the best, i remember the patch that changed the animation and a lot of rogues were mad at how dumb it looked. The smooth gliding is more badass.
---
I feel the same way, but will likely not play classic at all. I had my fun back then. It won’t be the same today. I feel that a lot of people will enjoy it, especially those that didn’t get a chance the first time, but no matter how overhyped it is right now, the majority of people are going to move on within a few weeks. Especially when the streamers start leaving. The pacing in vanilla from levelling to raid loot doesn’t fit in 2019 and it’ll begin to wear on people. A reasonably healthy community will keep playing though, which will be cool to see and check in on
---
It depends on what you mean by "noobs"
---
In Vanilla I would say that for 90% of the people, WoW was their first MMORPG. 
---
In Classic I would say maybe for 10% of people, Classic will be their first MMORPG.
---
And lastly, ignorance or lack of knowledge does not make you a noob in my opinion.
---
Agreed, but i want to earn it.
---
Alliance are also close to Onyxia. Theremore is in the same zone. You just need to take a gryphon and the Menethil boat. Or get a Mage port straight there.
---
I don't know.  But they were more "pristine" than ugly.  They looked very clean and the faces were very elegant even if they were supposed to be "alien."
---
Fuck that. I asked.
---
I'd imagine these people are massively invested in recapturing or experiencing the classic experience after so many years.
---
The notion of any changes must trigger an innate fear that blizzard may actually listen and once again deny them an experience they've been unable to have for 10 years.
---
Try not to take it personally.
---
Wow community are very creative lol
---
Hey, that's the intro to Warcraft III!
---
You don't really get to decide what classic was about.
---
Classic was a game released in 2004 that played until 2006 where it's first expansion came out.
---
Anything else is you being a douche with your ears plugged.
---
I hope they dont do this cross realm bullshit in classic
---
I'd go ally, but my brother wants to be Horde for the nostalgia. We were Horde the first time around.
---
Disagreement, that's fine.
---
How dare you, you don't understand what vanilla was about, get that toxic filth out of here
---
------
---
That stuff is the problem.
---
Yeah i get what you mean, i defiantly did have them setup like that at one point. but i always endup changing bindings to what fells better, so at the end of an xpac...things look like that. 
---
And while the key-binds might be everywhere, i generally have somewhat of a plan for abilities and cooldowns, with them been in action bar groups depending on if they're a colldown, consumable, main abilities, utility abilities. this was a pretty old layout so newer UI is abit less of a clusterfuck.
---
This all seems pretty ridiculous to me as someone who has raided at a top world level in later expansions. Even when I was in a guild that was top 30 US, we had people playing suboptimal specs and this was in 25 man. The simple fact is it's not easy to field 25 people to raid, let alone 40 people for a raid. This idea that even some of the better guilds have the luxury to turn away a good Ret Paladin and that there is always a superior warrior, rogue or mage available, waiting in the wings is crazy to me, there's no way it's true. 
---
Literal top 10 world guilds may not have a Ret Paladin or an Enhancement Shaman in the raid but otherwise guilds will have more flexibility.
---
Aww damn i was going to play a rogue. Ah well still will they look awesome. The UBRS key requires a random drop of a mob then a quest? Doesnt sound too bad unless the drop rate is tiny?
---
Cool
---
That's an heirloom mount to speed up levelling to level 20 for people sick of it :P
---
Of course numbers have been declining. It's a 15 year old game and genre that peaked a decade ago, in an environment where MMOs have way more competition in online gaming. And like I've said plenty of times, I don't agree with the direction WoW has gone, and I think the latest xpac is a culmination of terrible decisions. 
---
Yet, again, it doesn't mean millions of people don't still enjoy WoW. It doesn't mean that Classic is inherently better, they're two different games. Retail WoW for me is not a great game, and outside of playing content when it's new, it doesn't do anything to keep me around, but that's my view of it. When classic zealots not only insist that retail is garbage and that vanilla was a near perfect game, but then go on to blame and criticize other players, it just makes this community look like garbage.
---
The game has already been massively changed. Beta is far more responsive with controls, usession layering, has a ton of new UI features from retail and follows a very different than patch progression.
---
WildStar, Ultima Online, and FFXIV all had/have great housing systems.  Especially UO.  
---
But I agree that WoW isn't built with housing in mind.  I don't think any of the housing systems from those games would fit WoW, and I honestly can't imagine a system I would be happy with.
---
You are gonna need a base core to your guild before recruiting. If you are going at it alone no one wants to be the 1st to join. Everyone wants to join that party with the most to offer. Right now most people are just seeing the streamers making guilds and everyone who doesn't make it in will be scrambling to join anything that will take them. Problem with that is, why would anyone want the people the big guilds didn't. My honest suggestion, do your best to get a strong 20 players you already know, or find a guild. Starting a guild yourself is going to find you with players who just want a guild but aren't going to be as hardcore as you want.
---
I wish you good luck and hope you can get ahed of the game.
---
You often need 3 (atleast main and offtank) tankspecced in the runs (especially early when dps is bad). So even if you arent an officer you will get a tankspot.
---
Op what you want is WoW reboot. Thats what all you guys want.
---
A REBOOT
---
But this is CLASSIC.
---
You can play anything you want as long as you show up consistently and actively try to improve. The Fear Ward thing for priests is a crutch and can be handled by competent tanks, so don't feel like you need to play Dwarf if you choose Priest. 
---
There are some specs that are not *super* desirable because they can take a lot of effort to make work, but if you don't care whether or not you're going to be dealing damage, tanking (being the damage sponge who keeps enemies wrangled while your damage dealers deal with them), or healing, then any class in the game will suit you.
---
But he's playing Horde and not Alliance.
---
And it is alot worse trying to be dps warr and getting guildspots
---
story
---
UC is my favorite, but TB has by far the best bank-AH-mailbox-vendor set up for bank alts.
---
Err, because t1, t2 and t3 full sets are actually really good gear setups you know? Our tier sets are just much better itemized than some other classes.
---
Honestly people always parroted to avoid streamer servers like the plague, etc etc, but all the world PvP and other fun raid shit they are able to strum up on demand really has me kind of wanting to play on them.
---
That's sad :(
---
But literally nothing would ever make me to roll Alliance.
---
Bro
---
Changing it would be deciding what classic wow is, remaking the old game as close as possible to the original is the opposite of deciding what classic wow is.
---
You are correct, I was thrown off by this as well. The only way I can see this "top damage dealt not dps" thing being true is if you are including trash fights and such where people aren't taking those as seriously. 
---
Damage dealt is absolutely what matters the most but it's still highly contextual and at the same time people are FAR too worried about DPS in general, there just aren't that many DPS intensive fights in vanilla. Yes, having more damage generally makes things easier but there's so much more to being a good raider even as a DPS, than just doing damage. The ability to stay alive and not take unnecessary damage is extremely important.
---
Wrong. Maraudon will be there at release, if gurubashi arena wasnt they would have said it.
---
They very much did it in Vanilla. 
---
Due to sharding you don’t really run into any gold farmers anymore (not that I’ve seen anyway) but dear God they were EVERYWHERE in Vanilla. I think [this song](https://youtu.be/0dkkf5NEIo0) by Nyhm sums up our struggles perfectly.
---
When you see  Pandaren Monk in retail wearing druid tier set look alike and riding with Frostwolf Howler, you realize how horrible thing transmog and freedom of mounts actually is. I am super happy to see race and class identity again.
---
doesn't really seem like a problem
---
.
---
I come up INTP every time I look at one of those tests, and I wouldn't trade it for INTJ for all the tea in china.
---
Without the AFKing, yes :D
---
[That's just like, your opinion, man](https://i.imgur.com/X87ww3a.jpg)
---
They never said it was from vanilla my dude. Belongs more in the main WoW reddit than here though.
---
No.
---
People like gear progression, and hard resets such as WoW expansions are the greatest means of accomplishing this.  What you're suggesting is definitely far more niche and fitting for some games, but not WoW.
---
I actually loved FFXIV in its pre-reborn broken ass unfinished state.  
---
ARR was much more polished, playable, and coherent.  But it really lost something and it's been losing similar stuff since. 
---
With that said I loved the music and the hardmode fights in that game so much.  Had so much fun with Hardmode garuga and titan back in the day.
---
I would be fine with this after classics progression has finished
---
During vanilla on low pop servers it took like an hour or more waiting for bgs to pop.
---
that was funny lol
---
Developers decide, not you or myself. 
---
All I do is have discussions where people like you try to police and derail that discussion.
---
Hey random redditor with 0 hard facts. How many of the people that tried BFA stayed? Since you got the numbers: How many people even tried BFA? Was it bigger number than classic will get? 
---
Gief them facts dude. I trust your opinion.
---
It's the full beta, I've been playing it since before the first stress test
---
Pretty sure they will never make another MMO.  With the project titan failure, and pretty much no new MMO's getting any traction, and the people running Blizzard now, I can't imagine them developing a new one.
---
&gt; The majority of the content was produced in the last year. In the alpha/beta builds in 2004 they added new dungeons and zones to the game every few weeks.
---
I'm sure it was on their internal builds for much longer.
---
Pillar humping in of itself is not a coherent knock - it’s one of dozens of defensive strategies (and tbf if you didn’t know how to play around it you probably weren’t that good or experienced), and not even one that was ever abused or particularly annoying in any relevant arena season.  Saying otherwise would just prove a lack of experience playing meaningful arena games. I’ll give you that it’s indeed fair to say silences were handed out for PvP reasons, however, I’d say that the dumbing down of the game post WOTLK was a pretty blanketed approach on Blizzard’s part.
---
Why is there a discussion, it's called classic wow... It's not a do over it's a remake
---
invite them to a group, drop totems and stare awkwardly at them until they leave.
---
Debating between Rogue or possibly Druid for endgame PvP and PvE. I love the quick stealth kills. But also perhaps a Hunter?
---
Suck
---
Yeah SE cannot satisfy everyone, this is where it all started with cata, initially everyone will feel the need to defend then later we have communities like classic WOW.
---
I am not gonna play FFXIV again in my life been playing that game since 1.0 but Shadowbringers just makes everything same from what I have seen so far.
---
Having a robot pet or shadow clone is not enough for me, drk was awesome when it launched and the constant DA spam killed it in SB.
---
I would consider Heavenward to be BC for FFXIV. I cannot stand the game anymore. Hope you enjoy the journey as WOD.
---
Because this is a forum you toxic fuck.
---
I remember the first time I saw the dam, leveling my dwarf hunter in vanilla (because cinematic OBVIOUSLY) and as weird as it sounds (I was 13-14) it made me proud to be a dwarf. When it was destroyed in Cata I was legitimately sad about it.  It will be nice to see it again in August.
---
Alliance has a free +20% exp bonus for 6 months now, in retail. So it's nothing new.
---
My dwarf hunter also was.
---
The problem is that themepark MMORPGs lean heavily on raids for most of its endgame, and even midgame, content.
---
A raid is an instanced dungeon where a **FIXED** amount of players, between 5 and 40, try to go through and kill boss(es).
---
The reason why there's this much talk about efficiency, viability, minmaxing, etc. is that in a raid you're not only responsible for your own success, but for the success of between 4-39 other people.
---
Whenever a raid fails - and they can and do fail - people will start looking for someone to put the blame on, and your "out of meta", not optimized build will come under attack. Either subjectively(kneejerk screeching at the different guy) or objectively(there are in-game add-ons that measure performance of every single player and if you consistently find yourself at the bottom, well...) If you ever played a team game with small amount of players - like any MOBA, CS:GO, Overwatch, etc. - I'm sure you know how rabid can people get when they see underperforming teammates.
---
In the most extreme scenarios, a guild will simply kick out such a player because they will be seen as underperforming or a waste of a player slot in a raid.
---
Do you need to be SUPER careful and minmaxy? No, but you should still follow the general game meta and builds if you want to do dungeons/raids with others. For both your and your teammate's sake.
---
(Alternatively, you can simply not play a themepark MMORPG)
---
Alliance has the best access to DM. Horde have to swim for ages to get there.
---
Great, thank you
---
Infinite uses but only lasts 15-30 seconds and has a cooldown of 10-15 minutes.
---
So everyone else but you has a different menu option for the beta but you have the exact same options as me and I don't have the beta... Hm
---
You have healthstones too! :D
---
Making a thread about it and being a completely dickhead will certainly turn the tide.
---
I feel more or less the same way.  I hated most of the changes introduced in TBC, but I really loved the class balance design changes to make all the specs useful in at least something and to make healers viable as non-healers in raids.  
---
Disliked a lot about TBC otherwise though, from daily quests to the way they scaled raid gear to gear homogonization and the rating system introduction, along with the introduction of Resilience.
---
To me it's just a flavor passive added on top of the other racial abilities. It doesn't really bother me too much because the other abilities that trolls have are quite nice.
---
on
---
I’m guessing the old hordie quest lines never even came near there, and unless you did some exploring you might have never come across it.
---
You know, instead of spamming threads you could keep the discussion in one. You look triggered this way.
---
I think the main benefit was the haste it provides. Not they healing it provides.
---
You should elevate that monitor unless you are really short. That posture can´t be healthy.
---
Explain what the word classic means and why change should be acceptable in something dubbed classic.
---
Lmao. I am surprised the Waterwalking buff didn't clue them in. XD
---
I would love a GM so summon a big deamon in the middle to troll all the players 😂
---
shove your finger in its buthole
---
Possible and easier to do.  Didn't see a ton of it until cross-server BGs though.
---
I can get that, but honestly if I was a troll back then all the jokes about it would have embarrassed me.
---
Ive ran many guilds at the launch of games or an xpac, mostly for PVP, but some PVE too. really you want to start recruiting now to form a core. id get your guild priorities in order, loot type, raid days, and start trying to find people to join you. then start playing together now. play live wow or wow retail, get some bonds going, you dont need to be 40+ players now, get a strong core and your success in launch will lead other players to you. My guild in warhammer started with about 12 people prelaunch, but we quickly grew to about 35, because we attracted the best players because of our infamy.   
---
if your running a dungeon with 4 guildies and find a good DPS, or healer etc, they might be worth recruiting or talking to. One thing that has always failed me in raiding with wow though is NEVER STOP RECRUITING, i know it sucks to bench people and have a large bench, but you cannot have days where you cant raid because positions or key positions are not online that day, you need to get a replacement in and continue the raid. afew days of a raid not going again, and it can be a guild collapse.
---
We know Rogue noy will pop out when you jeed him in pvp! Or the BRD tavern!
---
Shadow priest warlock or mage for caster dps and utility for dungeon groups? End game raiding does not matter to me I mostly like playing solo/farming and running 5 Mans with some friends
---
Lmfao " But anyone who thinks it's going to cause some huge resurgence in subs for Blizzard or bring back some huge playerbase that left before is completely delusional. " You literally did...
---
I live the music and vibe there. Back in the day it was my main hearth
---
They didn't say they were removing it.  They said old school wall jumping won't be possible due to the engine change.  Most of the ways to get to the locations you're talking about involved wall jumping, but its still possible to do without.
---
Blizzard never said they wanted to kill that stuff.
---
Mom's spaghetti
---
Love this dungeon. One of my favourites (except the travel time for alliance).
---
Hey, am I crazy or are two of these guys wearing shields?
---
Not once was he toxic.
---
Wait with that kind of sass until we will be few months into Classic
---
Props for the last one for sure.
---
&gt; Fury tanking was possible during vanilla, but only on trivial content. In effect, private servers have been raiding trivial content since day 1.
---
That's assuming that pservers aren't overtuning their content, and we already know that armor values are buffed like crazy on there. Most bosses have 25% more armor. Patchwerk has 47% more armor.
---
Why do you speak about things you don't know anything about and being so negative for no reason?
---
The stress tests are to test the server and layering, that's why they have a few of them before launch. They've said the layering isn't working correctly but they're confident they'll get it to work until launch.
---
You don't seem to understand the technique, you don't seem to read anything Blizzard says and just wanna trash them for no reason... :s
---
Of course, the second Horde became dominant on retail, Blizz started handing out freebies for the "disadvantaged". 15 years of being underdog, we've heard "just deal with it". Now suddenly it's "It's not fair, we deserve freebies!". I guess that's how Alliance types are, no honor.
---
This was something people thought would happen in vanilla since there were language skills. So people threw out ideas of being able to learn other languages and going factionless or switching sides.
---
They swim to dire maul?
---
I played heaps of wsg, got exalted on one character and revered on others and never saw anything like this, and I used to play on 250+ms and still get most flag returns. I feel like batching countered the latency.
---
Its not like you couldnt visit a pserver, at all
---
Everyone will tell you to recruit before launch. This is usually useless for end game PVE unless you've played with them before. Helpful for levelling, but that's about it. 
---
Make a guild, race to 60, start recruiting fast levelling players as you level, recruit as many 60s as you can and start pushing content.
---
Make sure you know all content for all roles. If you have officers they can help, but raid leader/GM should know almost everything and have a clear cut raid plan. 
---
If you don't have experience in a content pushing guild you're probably in for a shock. Raid times should be consistent and serious.
---
Tl;dr
---
1) Roll warrior (main tank raids) 
---
2) Recruit all skilled players while levelling
---
3) Recruit all 60s
---
4) Consistent raid times with complete knowledge of all fights and mechanics for all classes
---
5) Push content and trim fat from guild
---
6) GG
---
The "phasing" for no reason is what they speak about that is "not working correctly"... layering having the ability to be exploited is what I was and have been talking about. 
---
Sorry you needed it spelled out since it's "positivity or nothing"
---
no you can see in the clip hes looking at his screen walking in a circle
---
[Such a weird](http://i.imgur.com/z0UR700.jpg) hill to die on, man. You need a screenshot from inside the actual beta next? It's the full thing. I don't know why somebody would lie about it. That is absolutely where your beta access shows up after your account is flagged. It originally said "Beta: Wow Classic" and was changed after the first stress test to reflect that as well. Don't make me dig through discord for the screenshot prior to the stress test
---
It is true. However it’s literally over leveled as in grey. Once a quest goes grey it starts giving reduced exp and rep. Prior to going grey the numbers are static.
---
Omar comin!
---
Anyone who’s been following Blizzard knows OW was a scrap from Titan
---
I´m making a list of PC components that will get an upgrade only bcause of classic. Things like a curved big monitor, mechanical keyboard, new mouse, external sound card, mic.
---
They could add in a Mythic system with fairly low effort. Pick a multiplier at the beginning of an ID - loot stays the same but you'll get  an entry in a leader board sorted by time and percentage completion. 
---
I wonder when MC becomes completely impossible full raidbuffed with T3 BIS. 3x/4x damage + health?
---
Heck there could be seasons and the winner of each season gets a title or maybe some other reward.
---
Omar is not a “who”, or a “what” really, he is everything and nothing. Omar is in everything in our world of Azeroth and is a transcendent being, when a Paladin or Priest greets you with “light bless you”, the light of which they speak is Omar.  
---
We should all give praise unto Omar for what he have wrought, he is the very fabric of our world.
---
What a class act.
---
Today I was stuck on my level 10 undead warrior quest going into that one crypt. I shouted 'LFG' a few times for a quest also in that crypt, but I got no answer. 
---
Then I just asked if someone would help me clear the crypt for my warrior quest and 3 volunteers popped up. I shared the other crypt quest and we went on our mission. 
---
I was expecting a lot of trolls in the stress test, but everyone was so friendly!
---
Make sure to use lower ranks of your spells as well for mana efficiency
---
Evidence that they would indeed make lots of money.
---
See the thing is, these are not QoL changes. Or rather, they are not ONLY QoL changes, which is the problem.
---
Transmog means you can't tell your opponent's gear in PvP. It might sound silly, but there are cases where that would be relevant.
---
Flying lets you freely travel through PvP zones or even high level PvE zones without being contested and dramatically alters the way levels are designed since there's always a "risk" of players skipping most of the zone just by flying.
---
And so on.
---
Man just stfu and let us enjoy our classic you dont have to play it
---
classic.wowhead database should be accurate, no? So there should be no problem to get the bags with a bit of grinding.
---
Are you ready
---
Thats why melee stand behind bosses 4Head only a 3Head melee dps stands in front to get parried / blocked. So the only issue is threat, which mostly just affects horde side. Salvation is strong enough to carry through except for fights like vael or something
---
rip fury prot...
---
I don't know either. I'm prob just salty because im not in. I just thought it was weird I was seeing people clients saying just beta classic. I thought that was the issue with everyone being confused about not being in the beta but being in the stress test. Enjoy your beta
---
Wow, you’re special...
---
Which, in turn, makes them generate more threat. 180% more parries is a big number, but it won't be as devastating as you make it sound. Healers will only have to expect more damage spikes from parries.
---
IMO spell batching is going to be a much bigger pain to deal with when trying to keep tanks alive.
---
Drink mana pots at half or 3/4 mana instead of going oom first.
---
I get lost every time i accidently go there and its hell every time
---
Both.. one of the perks of a PVE server.
---
I rarely play buff classes, but I run around with sagefish deliggts and give them to random people. Rogues and warriors can help toooo!
---
This! Down ranking is a necessity in Classic (vanilla pservers included).
---
Funnily enough they have done a similar story on that really violent Fortnite game all the kiddies are getting brainwashed with. Shit journalism.
---
How is having a horde of minions not an advantage lmao you sound retarded
---
 My Gnome riding a horse or cat shall be my first goal in classic lowbies will be stoked with all the carry runs
---
still haven't answered.
---
you're still the idiot trying to show off :)
---
Makes sense when you play WC3 TFT they’re a massive part of it.
---
You won't notice them at all. Imagine the population on 2 or 3 fixed seperate realms for like two weeks until everyone spreads out. 
---
The sad thing is that few will appreciate it at launch. If it goes smoothly people will say it was unnecessary, if not then it didn't work and shouldn't have been added. Having seen many first day launches, PServers and retail, they need something. Even with dynamic respawns players end up having to camp a spawn point to actually do quests. It's painful and damn near unplayable.
---
I vaguely recall this happening once in vanilla running with an auto-accept mod.  If this is easily replicated in classic then its definitely a bug, but if its extremely rare it may be legit.
---
Make sure you know what your efficient heals are. For example on a priest heal is normally better than flash heal. On a druid HT is usually better than regrowth. Other than that just make sure you always have a big stack of water and drink whenever you need to, as soon as you're out of combat.   
---
Other than that yeah it's pretty much whack-a-mole. How much you run oom will often come down to tank's gear and your gear and how much dps stand in the fire or get cleaved.
---
You know where the real battle for Azeroth takes place ;)
---
He does not need wings to fly ZULUL
---
Trolls don't use axes...
---
ignoring horde two stress tests in a row residentsleeper and that's not for a lack of trying either
---
Why level 10?
---
Horde is still trying to learn shapes  while Alliance already has choreography and language.
---
Cancel cast if the target is taking spikes of damage
---
Cast down ranked spells to top people off
---
Drink water every opportunity
---
Mama pot on cooldown
---
But you can't say anything downvoted is not relevant to Classic.   Classic already has a ton of changes making it different than vanilla.    There is no reason the devs should hear other views than just no changes.   
---
Plus, reddiquette is that you don't downvote if you disagree. A different opinion can still contribute to the discussion.  
---
Also, OP is asking for a discussion. If a change to vanilla is a bad idea, people can explain why.
---
Pretty much, yes.
---
Proof that the Horde are evil.
---
As stated above, use lower ranks if the damage isn't as big. Try to hold off for that extra 5 seconds to get a mana Regan tick if possible. ALWAYS bring your own supply of water, bring more than you think you need. 
---
Try and grab some +spirit gear for better regen and +int for a larger mana pool. 
---
Try to make your totems last, and make them worth the cost. If you won't be fighting for the full length of a healing stream totem don't drop it, same with mana spring. Things to take into consideration.
---
You don't need to read through anything. You can take advice from people if you need, but if you use common sense, you'll be fine.
---
And don't worry about the "min/maxers" saying something negative. Most of them have no clue what they are talking about, and are just parroting real theorycrafters, without the background knowledge and understanding whether something works or not. 
---
Just enjoy the game, the way you want. (Min/maxing is a valid way to enjoy it as well :D)
---
I like ffxiv and I like WoW,  but if you think WoW has "special" classes, well that's true to the extent that they bring something special but in the end a lot of them are pigeonholed into one thing. Bring the class not the player ordeal.

I sense you are doing something ironic
---
I'm pretty sure the "Cleanse the well" quest chain is Tauren-only, but I could be wrong.
---
The mace reward from the quest is definitely tauren-only.
---
Layering was much much better this stress test from my point of view
---
Big slow heals is usually the most mana efficient to use (exception is Flash of Light but not relevant here). Only use fast heals in emergencies and intensive fights.
---
Related above, avoid constantly healing (or casting spells). Whenever you do not cast spells you start to regenerate mana after 2.5 seconds.
---
Be sparse with totem use. Use all totems on boss fights or static fights (tank pull a room of mobs to the group one by one) and for regular trash packs only use healing totem or mana regen totem.
---
Chain heal is incredibly mana efficirnt but not always useful.
---
You should have given him detect lesser invisibility when he asked for the other one. :p
---
Which starting areas and what were they?
---
You could be right, but one can dream!
---
This is just false... Some of the world first streams had tens of thousands each with a couple over 30k and that was just recently. 
---
Don't get me wrong, it's got a ton of traction right now but to say something blatantly false is pushing the wrong narrative.
---
what horde racials are way better if you want to mention pvp, i do not understand your point at all, like it's not even remotely close either. 25% stun resistance by itself is way more OP than all of those combined not to mention with berserking, which is why it's gonna get nerfed. wotf goes without saying. then an aoe stun+base health+nature resist. troll's racials in comparison look garbage and they're still better for pvp than human/ne. so it seems your only point is that paladins are better than shamans and that's cool but doesn't prove your point at all
---
Except when you get to a quest area and others are after the same objective, then the invites fly
---
He’s not that bad lol, I just recently started watching his streams/highlights and I kinda get his shtick. The man knows the game too.
---
Even the devs hate the horde.
---
Heh
---
Rogues might be better than fury warriors then.
---
VR it is.
---
who remembers doing this for the first time on emulators only to discover its bugged and every single mob comes running at you at the same time
---
He's clearly enjoying a nice evening with Felicia.
---
That's actually some sick looking gear.
---
If people want. They choose the leveling experience they want, solo or in groups, and it has always been that way
---
That's a lot of streamers
---
I sorted out our spare bedroom that was previously just a junk room with a bed. Built a computer (amd ryzen build, fairly low-budget but very happy with the outcome) and decked the room out with a nice desk and chair, a couple of monitors and basically everything needed for a gaming setup. 
---
I spend a lot of time in there now (although no games are scratching the itch) and I'm enjoying chilling in there. The room looks heaps nicer too. 
---
Now I just need classic to actually launch!
---
Not everyone here posts. And many that post don't necessarily agree with the list majority. It's not uncommon for someone to post something here and get downvoted to Oblivion because they roll against the narrative. 
---
There's a significant number. We can say that. We'll see what happens in a few months.
---
ITT (and his other thread): calling everyone toxic. The lack of self-awareness is astounding.

He fled into the void only to be imprisoned by the legion for his failures and tortured. His tortured form is a boss in legion.

Good thing that those things won’t happen.

I know where this is! The quest npc I was searching for was dead because of this beast yesterday.

Well, compared to phasing it'll be quite hard to exploit it. And for those that can exploit it and make us of it, they kind of don't need it since they'll for sure be ahead of the curve in lvls anyway.

So I really don't understand your point.

---
I'm just like you. Played a bit of retail , and yeah I was bored with it. I made an account for a private server and 20 hours in the past 3 days of playing I realized I haven't had this much fun in a game in years.
---
I really cant wait till classic launches.
---
Haha, same. I keep telling her this and she keeps laughing. Like I'm joking or something...
---
I'm trying really hard to figure out what feels so different about this video. Like everything looks smoother.. more fluid. Is it the lighting?
---
The game looks beautiful. Way better than any pserver experiences I've had..
---
Currently when a mob spawns in the game world, they immediately start moving.  
---
As I recall the mobs should be standing still for 5 seconds and not aggro to any players within that time. Only the non-aggro mechanic is working as intended.  
---
According to the Vanilla Wow Wiki, it also mentions this.

Some people are used to speed running dungeons in retail.  It's not your problem if they're not letting you drink, if they're not using CC or they're 2handing everything. This doesn't help, but some groups are just bad and it's not your fault.
---
I’m in support of classic+ or ctbc. That said, I want this 2019 - 2021 server progression to be as 2004-2006 as possible. 
---
In fact if they don’t release classic+ or ctbc, I certainly won’t be playing vanilla wow a 3rd time. And based on the trend since wod, I’m not sold retail is going to be something I want to play as my main game as this set of classic servers will be. 
---
If you’re going to make these posts, make it clear you don’t mean the set of servers coming in 2019, you may get a different response. Cause even I don’t want changes to this coming release.
---
Conserve mana has to become your new religion. Treat your mana bar as if it were your own hp bar. 
---
Do long heals cancel-casting if not needed instead of short-expensive heals (use those only as an emergency/pvp).
---
You know you're getting better as you realize you do not need to stop so much to drink and keep the flow of the dungeon going on (and people don't die of course).

I never noticed until now what a ridiculous name Stonewrought Dam is. *Stonewrought Dam*. *Dam* which is *wrought* out of *stone*. It'd be like building some large imposing gate and calling it **Woodbuilt Door**.

---
You could always go around with your ground mount, but the dodging of bridges and buttressses is more fun from the air.
---
Stop trolling
---
That's still pretty cool, do you keep it after you turn in the quest or do you just never turn in the quest?
---
Nah. You have shitty private servers for that
---
All polls have been close to 50/50.
---
Don't use rank 1 healing wave ever unless you're really just oom as fuck, costs twice the mana for 75% of the healing.
---
People roll humans on stress tests since it's the most players there, even if they for example will play horde.
---
Actually without healing power the highest rank is the most efficient.
---
Priest healing.
---
Well maybe for the virgin fury warrior that has no ability to reduce its thread. But the Chad Rogue doesn't care about threat.
---
bhm240 pls
---
Ahh you didn't need to. Back in vanilla, that was a common word to spell wrongly. Thanks for taking it in stride!
---
Lordaeron was the only (non-insectoid) kingdom to completely fall to the scourge. The forsaken are former citizens of Lordaeron because the goal in Lordaeron is to create a kingdom of scourge, in quel thalas it was to get to the sunwell , which is why we have the dead scar running through instead of everything being the ghostlands. The risen elves are a small small minority in comparison to the entire kingdom of Lordaeron.
---
Nochanges. It was great with all the flaws.
---
If you level a troll warrior and have spirit gear, it's very noticable in combat, that plus troll blood potion and mobs will see you as an impossible raid boss.
---
Ohh Orc female? That might have been me if you’re playing on Lightbringer.
---
I work 12s, panama schedule. Its not bad, 2on 2off 3on 3off type thing.
---
He's super interactive and easy to talk to on his stream.
---
I had a really shitty laptop back in TBC. I would always stay in the loading screen so long on boats and zeppelins that I'd end up back where I started, but Undercity took the fucking biscuit. I would disconnect and die in the elevator EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. 
---
Still a neat place though
---
99% of the reactions I have seen to shadowbringers is positive. OP is really standing out right now as the incredibly negative 1%. They either don't understand why the changes were made or are just looking for a reason to leave. I would suggest that he watch the presentation again on Twitch and the explanation why they are being made from Yoshida himself. 
---
This is some serious over-reacting.
---
The reason to level fast is to be able to start making good gold fast and a lot of farming methods even at 60 without DM help with skinning. So its a good skill to take with you. It also ensures your mount at 40 which will be necessary (even though you could probably get it without it). It does not really affect the time as much and is definetly worth it in my opinion.
---
I know. I'm currently working on that issue
---
I really enjoy the what if discussions (although many are so so similar to what we discussed half a year ago). Havent really been bothered by the "wall of no" people trying to screech in the middle of those threads. 
---
(Wall of no here being a joke since first people pasted the wall of no to classic fans and now you have those classic fans doing the same thing to others discussing future paths wow could take)
---
Oh yeah I've never followed blizzard. BfA is my first game!
---

---
Not much harder since you always melee dps from behind.
---
Someone said elsewhere, and I re-watched it with this in mind, the updated shadows make a *huge* difference.
---
I thought I told you to refrain from further retardation.
---
We have found yet another individual who’s vanilla character level is higher than his iq!
---
I am not debating you, I am making fun of you for having a fundamental lack of understanding of the topic at hand. You keep demonstrating that lack of understanding over and over.
---
Blizzard will continue to polish till it goes live. There will probably even be bug fix patches coming a month or two after phases release. 
---
There is no chance it comes earlier, they’ve spent resources marketing it for 8/27.
---
There is nearly zero advantage (if any) to releasing ahead of schedule.
---
This is pretty accurate I think. Vanilla was/is the best video game that I've ever played and it's not available. I'm excited to have it back. I'm not excited about rolling the dice on something different right now. Just want that original version of WoW available to play.
---
You couldn't really scale straight invisible walls. any other walls you could though.
---
Ashenvale, but yeah essence of water was worth a lot. Maybe I'll go there to farm again ;)
---
Ah nice.  Could not find formula for that!
---
Level 40 for 60% speed and 60 for 100%
---
This is the border between Loch Modan and Wetlands, as it looked before Cataclsym. You can actually see this dam being destroyed in the Cataclysm cinematic.
---
What concerns me is that the community wanted Dire Maul pushed back because it would make MC and early content too easy. Blizzard even said themselves that "Some of the loot that’s attainable from Dire Maul is so good that it would affect progression through those early raids"
---
At the same time no one even seemed to care that nearly everything you find in a pre raid BiS list is from patch 1.4 gear from the normal dungeons. Most of the items in these lists didn't exist or didn't have any spellpower on them before this, they are as good as Dire Maul gear. 
---
Obtaining all of these items can give you 350+ spellpower without enchants pre raid which is crazy to me. My BWL BiS mage had 10% crit and 440 spellpower without enchants. When we did early MC I had about 50 spellpower on my mage because most of those items didn't exist. It made boss fights a lot longer and healing much harder. 
---
Healers stacked spirit and would rotate as healing groups because the fights went on much longer and mana was a huge issue. Flasks didn't persist through death either and were a pain to make so no one used them. 
---
It's not going to be anywhere near as difficult or rewarding early on. I think MC will be cleared within the first month of release by a lot of raiders. No on will experience what it was like to be steamrolled by shamans in world pvp when no one had gear. People will miss the experience of 10 man scholo or 15 man UBRS.
---
I loved this event, damn.
---
Omar?
---
What kind of FPS you getting with your card &amp; cpu?
---
Really curious if you're able to keep it high even in big battles.
---
Yeah.  It's sad but they don't even have Metzen anymore...
---
A god dam god dam.
---
That's the worst part. I'll have to play something else now
---
That was my first thought. The graphical improvements really shine in this clip
---
&lt;Omars Hand&gt;
---
Fist of Omar
---
The Omar Guard
---
So many options
---
All your examples don't make any sense and WoW is for casuals so deal with it.
---
Pservers will have dark souls mode, go enjoy that.
---
Crikey what a beaut!
---
These are some of the greatest screenshots ever taken. Prove me wrong.
---
Depending on definition it's not walljumping. Especially if you're going by the definitions used by the exploration community back in the day.
---
What is your crit rate and talent point?
---
Level as dps spec until around 55. Switch to healing spec and do the last 5 levels in dungeon groups.
---
We won’t let Blizzard see even a glimpse of the change side getting traction. Our guys are doing some great work over at the Blizzard forums, they expect us to do the same here as well.
---
Blizzard is notorious for taking input from scrubs i.e destroying their own game. We will not let that happen to this game.
---
Every Classic fan in this sub is eligible to make one downvote per post. I’ll say make those downvotes count.
---
#imdoingmypart #nochanges
---
I assume this was Asmongold prior to doing something daft?
---
Tony Stark of Blizzard basically.
---
Don't disrespect Jar'Vis like that he works hard driving my lazy ass around
---
Enjoy classic there bud.
---
Most people that argued for walljumping because they did it back in the day also said you would have to fix WSG as it's really easy to get behind both flag rooms.
---
People want vanilla since the day it ended.
---
Also people "why do you downvote people that want vanilla changed?"
---
There aren't "slight" changes here mate, in 2 years of these threads, there wasn't a single "slight" change that was suggested. 
---
What a "slight" change means is something like more hair styles. What people think is "slight" is balancing classes.
---
PS: Slight= "resembles" a change.
---
We lost him. Once you start calling in-game as "in real life" it's all over.
---
How does splitting account bound items like that going to work? Is "Classic going to have a separate "play" button in the battle net launcher like the ptr? Or special servers in the normal game that don't have access to those items like mounts?
---
Yikes btw im twelve btw
---
Will be fun to see their raiding guilds not even entering MC after 1.5 years because they forgot how long times dungeons take and how lucky have to be to get your item. 
---
"BIS ONLY OR NO RAID INVITE" lol
---
Should be absolutely fixed, no question.
---
Doubt anyone can convince me otherwise, that this is the way the game is supposed to be played.
---
Still wouldn't be able to use it because it requires level 60.
---
It would be super good if the gnome story had gone anywhere... All the side stuff in that dungeon, for nothing. Ever. Remember the battle for Gnomergan event? Pointless.
---
Cause they're fun
---
Theramore mage Port is Not in vanilla
---
This is why RP servers are the best, that's just common sense there =D
---
Honestly, why shouldn't they? They were shat on for years upon years with shit like the Wall of No. Everyone who wanted a vanilla server was seen as a moron and an outcast, capped off with the WoW devs literally telling them that their own thoughts and opinions are wrong. Fuck that.
---
The point when it is "fun" to see ele sham in PvE means you have serious issues in PvP, like a class whos already deleting ppl within 2 globals is now running with infinite mana.
---
This and more... I'd rather have Classic as it is, sorry.
---
If PvE like raiding you'll need imp MotW and Thorns so this won't work.
---
Otherwise the build is good except for imp starfire.  I really want those talents to be good but they suck.  As alliance is never procs and if it does it's resisted in PvP.  It's never worth casting because double Wrath is safer.  Just supeelr underwhelming talent imo.  Just get mana efficiency talents.
---
i'm INTP and i mained druid vanilla to wotlk.... i feel called out
---
The only exception is if you have players that need a weird or uncommon raid time / schedule.  Makes it easier to hold a group together if everyone is on that schedule.
---
Dwarf paladin
---
And here it is. The post I've been waiting for to gush about Loch Modan.
---
My buddy got me into WC3 and then WoW.  I was into it from the start, but in Loch Modan is where I fell in LOVE with this game.  I have played it for 15 years now, over half my entire life.  This is THE zone I remember most fondly, the place I think of if my main character (the first toon I ever made, still my main to this day) had a "home".  This dam should have been fixed years ago, they massacred my favorite zone.  But I don't have to worry about that any more, because I'm going home soon.
---
attempt!
---
Threat dumps get parried too.
---
The keys to not going OOM in lower level dungeons are: using the most efficient heals possible, drinking in between every pull, breaks in between casting to allow spirit based mana regent to kick in, and not healing the dps if they aren’t actually in danger of dying from further damage.
---
At low levels down ranking won’t provide the same benefit as when you are in endgame gear with plus healing.
---
Well that depends. If a couple of streamers come together on a server, they can easily get thousands of followers, and effectively "rule" the server.
---
I think you are underestimating how many nabs will follow these people till the end of the world.
---
I'm curious how this situation was ever resolved for you
---
my hearts always been with horde, ever since i first started playing wow but at the same time i'm the hugest thirstiest slut for night elves, their aesthetic and their everything is just so sick. and gear looks real nice on them. but i'd feel like the worst faction traitor ever if i rolled filthy alliance. so i guess i have some stuff to work out still ahah
---
If only those buff trolls were the playable ones...
---
You've been smoking again haven't you, this is a time to be honest with yourself
---
Wowwww orc seemed like the obvious choice for shaman but after seeing how great warstomp is in PvP I'm thinking otherwise...
---
"Mine and my son's relationship is becoming strained because of a computer game. Yes, definitely the computer game. No, it's nothing to do with the fact that I'm the sort of person who would sell him out to local news for 5 minutes of fame."
---
WoW 'addiction' was the world's chance to realise that leaders needed to make irl at least as exciting (and less obviously stacked against the average lvl 5 NE) as the Menethil - Ironforge death run. I guess we should try and teach them again(?)
---
Yes he can, he is but one of many. We will not let you ruin this release. Retail is there for you.
---
it's bis for tanks in naxx
---
So they are trying to make everyone happy? They better be careful, its an impossible task.
---
Of course it is. Where did I get 10 from?
---
It's such a great zone.  It is sandwiched between the easy starting zone of Dun Morogh, the Wetlands, and the scary Badlands.  That NE lodge was totally hidden and really established it as a hidden area of the world, a secret stronghold of the elves that a dwarf/gnome player most likely wouldn't have even encountered yet.  Shit I love that zone.
---
German for money is "Geld", so very similar to gold. 
---
I was working for a bank back then, WoW almost ruined my day job because I kept talking about gold when talking about funds in customers accounts. I managed to force myself to use synonyms later but it was easily the biggest change to my life throught WoW.
---
Damn, I forgot about the screenshots of the day! I used to check the site almost every day, there was some really cool community driven stuff.
---
stop caring about downvotes you'll have fun poking retailbabs
---
Well on top of the updated client I'm playing on a 2560x1440p 144hz gsync monitor. It tends to display colors beautifully aswell.
---
The smoothness you are describing is basically consistent framerate and it FEELS alot better than it looks. Hard to understand if you've never felt the mouse precision and smoothness of 144hz.
---
As for the 1.12 pserver client... for me it felt too dated to enjoy and the poor performance made me avoid vanilla pservers. For awhile there was a pserver that ran a beautiful 2.4.3 client  based off a newer version and they built it backwards.
---
On pservers, especially the 1.12 clients, theres this unforgivable movement glitch effect that every character does. It's almost like they will suddenly bounce around like a mini teleport every now and again. Looks similar to rubber banding or even lag but it's not.. it has to deal with how the game and the server are registering players movement.
---
The majority of 1.12 client players and most pserver players in general tend to not notice.. or they are used to it. But once you notice it its game breaking and very visually irritating especially in big groups.
---
Watch any 1.12 private server video and watch other players closely. Its especially more noticeable while on a mount. The character will stutter around and it happens in less than a second..this occurs frequently like every 10 seconds.
---
Exactly. The next alt lvling wont have the same feeling probably. Fresh is nice
---
What was the first? I'm curious! Also curious what you consider a "region", but I love Loch Modan and the Eastern Kingdoms.
---
Can’t decide between mage or priest myself. I will only be able to play 10 hours a week so I want a good leveler. I’ve Mained a holy paladin mostly throughout wow but they seem really bad to level. Thinking priest might be that half way mark for me but mage seems so efficient in everything it does.
---
I feel like this needs to be a meme. Quick someone creative make it happen!
---
... what kind of attitude is this?  We're all rejoicing that this location is back on official servers, this is a big deal.  We don't need to hide on illegal private servers to enjoy it.  If you think private servers offered all you need for vanilla then go have fun, but don't try to damper the excitement of the majority of vanilla fans.
---
Don't call me Shirley
---
some pics had a lot of fun again =)
---
 [**https://imgur.com/a/ltItszg**](https://imgur.com/a/ltItszg)
---
Woah a lot of skewed information here.
---
First off we have no idea what is going to be harder and how much private servers are different to how classic will be.
---
Armor is a huge deal and it is not 2%. In fact going from 0 to 1,5k armor is 15% damage reduction, so 2% is very wrong.
---
Yes private servers don't have a server cooldown for world buffs, but this is design decision. You fail to mention that you have 4x as much population as a vanilla server and a much more active raiding community and due to international community (compared to regional vanilla wow servers) there are multiple raid times as well.
---
Back in vanilla it would be extremely rare for a raiding guild not to get their world buff when they wanted one. Commonly the few raiding guilds would just arrange buffing times, since they would have same raiding times as well. This would be impossible on private server, so it was a design decision. 
---
As for rebuffing world buffs, this basically almost never happens either. You use world buffs typically in two situations: its a farm raid you want to go faster, or it is a boss you are stuck on like 2% and need an extra dps push.
---
As for black lotus again it is the same design choice as with world server buff thing. Will be interesting how Blizz will address the fact that more people will want flasks this time around then back in vanilla. Also vanilla black lotus was not 4 hour but 1 hour.
---
You have it wrong with parry as well. This is parry chance of boss not warrior. Warrior will still have their regular parry chance, not 14%. So this new found thing will not impact druid dps compared to warrior, it does impact druid and warrior survivability though.
---
So for which is harder it is just very much unknown. In fact many private servers aproached it differently and have major differencces in between them and much of the stuff related to it, is based on server side data which was guess work. 
---
Still no reason to skew whatever data we have so far to make it "crystal clear".
---
"This dumb fuck has failed me so many times I'm going to torture the fuck out of him.. then give him an important position defending my throne.. what could go wrong?" 
---
Full disclosure I don't actually know *what* Antorus is, I've never been to Argus. Is it a giant tower or temple or something? How is the area structured?
---
can you explain this for someone that doesn't play bfa?
---
Hunter dude.
---
Lol, meanwhile on the alliance side right around 4pm server time, we attempted to write something at the entrance to SW... 
---
"BBB" 
---
Perfect.
---
Don't miss the 2000 stoneshard farm
---
\*superior
---
There were instances where Guild Masters got fed up with the guild, took everything from the guild bank and transferred to another server.
---
It looked cool in the cinematic.  Darkshore got me,  When I  had my first toon I don't think i left till like level 30 that place was home to me.
---
they named their city Ironforge are you really surprised
---
That last shot is incredible
---
I try and buff them with random scrolls of agility or strength when they buff me.
---
Hi, /u/geze46452
---
Don't forget shaman has great auto attack damage, even a healer, get in there and auto attack main target and heal when needed, the faster mobs die the less you need to heal.
---
What I’ve heard from watching honestly too many interviews is that they were handed the source code from the nostalrius people, and essentially Omar was tasked with finding out if it’s authentic, making sure there wasn’t anything malicious in the code, and then having to create a prototype of the classic game running on modern hardware and battle.net systems. I might be off on the amount of time but I vaguely remember an interview where it was revealed Omar locked himself away from everyone for 2 straight weeks to get it to work on the current client and systems, without which they would never greenlight a classic server.
---
Um, I'm just refering to the fact that he supposedly waited years to see this dam whole again. I just thought it was funny, beacuse he could log onto any pserver and walk there
---
meanwhile sodapoppin throwing a whiney tantrum over why doesn't the alliance queue for WSG
---
“Kitchen’s closed.”
---
im just picturing a giant steamroller coming through that gate and flattening them all
---
 Battlegrounds will have X-realm, but the world won't.
---
Again: Every healthy servers pvp twink population did exactly that.
---
And no, it's not "exciting". These people whould kick lvl 30 in the arse so quickly, their feet would break space-time, if they had the opportuity to advance their game. At 30, WoW is in fact pretty lame. You have access to a handful of dungeons, all of which are essentially boring af stompfests, none of the big questlines are available, barring a few interesting class-quests, and you are still just out of the second zone after the starting areas.
---
That's not for Omar the dev though, that's Omar the soccer player it seems.
---
I would go imp thorns, rage isn't really an issue bear tanking in my experience once you get some decent gear.
---
Is this rar on doomhammer because im 99% sure thats my paladin on the far right.
---
It was Omar who figured out how to get the classic information to be read by the current client and infrastructure. That's why it was possible.
---
Fantastic how Mythic Entertainment managed 3 factions for Dark Age of Camelot with 3 unique continents and a shiiiitload of more classes back in 2001. Compared to a small indie company like Blizzard at the time =P
---
\*gasp\* How dare you misclass my character! HOW DARE YOU!
---
then you get reported for harassment. Buffing strangers in vanilla gone wrong!
---
Yes 31/0/20 hybrid sham that is. Dps in bgs, able to farm (pref with a warr in duo), can heal in farm raids or respec deep resto for progression raids here and there.
---
If you asked him. I doubt he would say he was the only reason it happened and had zero help.
---
Running out of interesting things to post are we?
---
Wanna make old areas useful again? Make professions real again. 
---
Give me a reason to farm briarthorn at 120. Or wicked claws. 
---
I get they wanted us fo do the new content the new zones. But with scaling it’s all relevant content. 
---
Have rare patterns drop in raids, that are on par with loot otherwise in the dungeon. There should be some badass wep/shoulders (or some visible item slot) pieces that are just better than pieces from the raid...maybe it’s first tier and the crafted non set (fuck me they better bring back sets after bfa) shoulders give crit haste (assume those are your best stats), the non set drop shoulders give crit mastery and the tier gives vers mastery. Maybe the Uber crafts come with off budget on use effects. 
---
Scatter the mats across different expansions, Put some material in only loptable in mythic 0 dungeons. Maybe it’s an elemental themed weapon, so you’ve gotta gather essences, motes, primals, volatiles, Spirits of Harmony, and w/e they’ve been since wod...
---
It’s cool how Free Action Potions, Swiftness Pots and invisibility pots have maintained usefulness and all use old mats. 
---
Wow could use more of that.
---
It did but it was a disorganised fuckfest too, compared to Esfand's layer's neat name.
---
Love that [chain lightning](https://imgur.com/a/VpmkyzI)
---
The creativity of the Dwarves has been significantly diminished in my eyes I'll admit. Industrious folk, but not very creative.
---
Yes because it's so simple to log into a private server.  On top of that, most players don't want to dedicate time to a server that may disappear overnight.
---
i also feel this way about jumping while you run past someone, when they start jumping back it warms my heart, its basically the wow version of waving and saying hi
---
Mhmm.
---
I don’t have buffs so I give a nice /cheer instead
---
He pointed out that he has a different poinion than you, and was even supportive towards your opinion as an experiment on separate servers.
---
As a reaction, you insult him.
---
And you accuse him of being the toxic one? What the hell is wrong with you?
---
Not trying to pick this apart, it was really cool what happened, but how is this Esfand summoning Omar?
---
There are literally hundreds of people there, all creating an experience worthy of Omar. How does the streamer get the credit for making it happen?
---
Did Esfand organize the whole group through his stream?
---
This is such an orc thing to do lol
---
6 dancing hero druids though
---
Bow to Him
---
Hi, thanks for the data!
---
I ran this through SPSS to see which cells were over- and underrepresented for each personality type (because this wasn't easily visible from your charts.  
---
Results: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12ZuN43eDcEuOgsDtdOYR4lo1Xu75ercxqOzU86pri8E/edit?usp=sharing
---
&gt;And I don't want to wait for AQ for somewhat challenging raid content.
---
Judging by how you react to people in this thread, and what that says about you as a player, I think you won't have to wait that long.
---
Oh sure. Nothing in vanilla was tremendously hard in vanilla from an execution standpoint. I still think there's a good chance everything, including Naxx will be PUGgable at some point.
---
I just have done these fights with a good guild and shit like killing C'thun in one weakened phase, or dropping Patchwerk in 90 seconds seem a bit over the top to me. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe world buffs do more than I think, but that's more than double (my memory is bad but I think more than triple)  the DPS top 10 world guilds are doing, and while I'm 100% sure people will do more damage than we did, the scale makes me expect a few things like this party chance discrepancy to allow things down just a bit.
---
Sometimes they'll buff 4-5 times before going OOM. It's pretty funny. I've had people rage at me cause their OCD demands I be buffed.
---
Still was quite a gamble considering I know plenty of people who played on private servers who would, in their own words, "never pay to play it" and are only into it because it's free.
---
There sort of already is in EPL and Silithus.
---
Thanks, I'll just have to save it for later.
---
It’s late and reading the title I was kind of confused why he’d really want a bunch of nagas to see who was the fastest
---
Self-Awareness 100
---
&gt;Really? I thought orcs could not resist incapacitates they way they resist stun. 
---
Indeed - their racial does not help against incapacitate effects, only stuns. That said the sentence directly before the one you quoted sheds some light on this. Here's the full statement:
---
&gt;And despite being a hard CC which breaks on damage (what is typically an incapacitate effect), for whatever reason [grenades are] actually a special type of STUN that breaks on damage. As such, Orc resists a bunch of grenades, which makes their advantage even bigger in serious PvP!
---
That said, grenades being coded as special stuns instead of incapacitates could be a pserver thing - I haven't personally checked on the beta, though I imagine it would be easy enough to check up on.
---
I dont really even bother monitoring it. I have a BiS rig and I was amazed at how well it was running last night. Before everything and everyone started freezing and running in place I started to  noticed lower framerates. 
---
Also we are all level 10 with no real impactful spells. Imagine all these people casting AoEs etc it would be alot worse.
---
With gsync your framerate and how it works can get tricky but basically I manually cap my framerate at 140 right below my monitor 144hz refresh rate. With vsync and gsync enabled in the nvidia control panel. By capping it at 140 this ignores the input lack caused by having vsync enabled.
---
*Not sure if that makes any sense but basically gsync means my framerate is more consistent.*
---
Then it's just some magic and it looks smoother. If I were to uncap my framerate I'd be able to manage 100 to  240 frames per second.
---
In this video I even rendered it out from 1440p to 1080p so it's just a taste.
---
Here's a [video](https://youtu.be/euAr-QOo2lU) I took towards the end. The only lag I notice is related to the server and not my own performance.
---
Never played Ultima never heard a bad thing though. I also hear good things about FFXIV. WildStar always seemed like they were trying too hard to simultaneously be wow and not be WoW. 
---
That said, if wildstar came out today and classic wow wasn’t a thing, I bet it’d do much better.
---
Also plays Chalkie White in boardwalk empire.  Top actor
---
&gt;it's not at all cancerous
---
You reacted toxic towards everyone who wasn't immediately 100% in support of your opinion, and accuse the subreddit as being "not classy".
---
Okay.
---
Eat my downvote.
---
Id choose rogue over warrior for casual plays (also your post implies you want to roll a rogue). Rogue is so much better playing solo than warrior solo (bgs, farming, wpvp, profession lvling etc). In early raids rogues and warriors have equal number of dps spots and both are top dps, and as such wanted. 
---
The only downfall is 5men dungeons where warrior tanks can organize groups quicker. Do you OK with tanking?
---
Interesting. Maybe we’ll see an approach like how Jagex handled Oldschool Runescape.
---
That's because he is =)
---
This is pretty much my wet dream for classic wow. Brand new content/expansion that keeps true to the core values of vanilla wow.
---
1. Yes, it is. 
---
2. I'm not talking about deticating gods-know-how-much time to it. Just going to see the (damned) dam. Cheer up bro.
---
what a crock of shit. Ally did not dominate Horde 3 to 1 in vanilla. Like always, it depended on what server you were on. Many realms today have been Horde dominant since day 1.
---
In bfa (today), there is so much more horde than alliance that all the top guilds switched horde because they had no people to recruit. Alliance is basically dead, and "world first" raid clears from the alliance side is weeks, months even after horde.
---
Thanks for the insight.
---
&gt; Implying these MoP fish people are superior to Murlocs... see, this is where your problem is! Bad meme
---
Are you 100% on that? Because I don't play I searched around before posting. A few sources indicated that the early Legion wardrobe restrictions had changed: 
---
[source](https://www.wowhead.com/news=280769/transmog-changes-for-low-level-players-in-7-3-5)
---
&gt; At level 1 you can transmog to appearances found on gear requiring up to level 60 to equip. 
---
[source](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/7qy2ap/you_can_now_transmog_160_gear_on_level_1/)
---
1. Layering is temporary, even if I don't like it. It's not a permanent change.
---
2. Yes... it's on the legion client, thats been clear since the announcement. It doesn't change the game if all carryover bugs are squashed.
---
3. The patch is FROM Vanilla. Allow me to quote one of your comments in this thread. 
---
&gt;You don't really get to decide what classic was about.
---
Classic was a game released in 2004 that played until 2006 where it's first expansion came out. *Anything else is you being a douche with your ears plugged.*
---
4. You can feel free to call everybody that disagrees with you toxic, but thats really taking the purpose and power away from the word.
---
Declining numbers says otherwise. And it's still gear progression. You just don't level. And you still reset, you just replace with quest gear that are sets with an option of keeping your tier 3 upgraded though those same quests instead of picking quest gear. I only brought that up so you don't have to immediately trash your hard earned t3 with green sets immediately. You prefer up through gear instead of levels. Look what became of leveling at new expacs, it's so streamlined that there's 0 point to it except that you have no choice.
---
Where did you get the mousepad?
---
* The fact that our internet connections are better than they were 14 years ago has nothing to do with the game
---
* Layering will be turned off
---
* No, the UI is mostly the same, and in fact different from retail
---
And none of these points supports your intentions to have a completely different game. What you want is a rework, not a restauration. We want a restauration. And we are the majority.
---
It does look like it to me im pretty sure thats my paladin on the far right.
---
I remember someone accompanying me from Menethil Harbor to IF - good ol' days. What I wouldn't give to go back to that summer of 2005. :(
---
Remember the user submitted comics? I used to browse through those for hours
---
Or... it's almost as if people who want Vanilla the way it was, aren't one conglomerated mass of people, and are *actually real different people*.
---
does this imply that tauren can be rogues in retail now? dear god
---
Goddamn! I just saw a goddamned god damn. 
---
Damn.
---
You insulted basically everyone in your original thread, who wasn't immediately in agreement with you.
---
The problem is not other people. The problem is how you behaved towards them.
---
And in this thread, you continue the toxicity, by insulting the entire subreddit.
---
Wie man es in den Wald hineinruft, so schallt es zurück.

use lower rank heals on group. use top rank heal to heal tank. dont heal if you dont need to (if someone is at 85% hp)
---
Wow thats awesome this is what WoW is (:

In his anger it appears that he deleted his character.

Enjoy your Septic shock and mudhuts. One Gnomish flying machine could also make the Tauren go extinct.
---
Those same people existed on RuneScape private servers. 
---
A lot of the ones I knew have been subbed to osrs for like 6 years now.
---
Yes but have you tried Holy? That is my question, have you done 1-40 other than shadow? I have done and untill 40 shadow feels no faster unless you are a Troll.     I'll be honest i have never tried disc focus pre 40... i think it might also be good. 15% mana regen in combat and +15% PWS is rather nice. 
---
" And granted Spirit Tap makes leveling a joke" you know everyone specs the same first 10 talents points. (Well everyone who wants a good spec.)
---
"Holy Nova is also very expensive to cast. Not looking to deplete my mana every pull if I get 2 mobs." 100% agree its not that great. But the other stuff in holy/disc are really good. 
---
Shadow is good, but after the first 9-11 points in it you don't really gain much but silence until you respec at 40 (36 makes MF worth using, oddly the disc spec is better at this still). If you have a shadow damage wand i think Shadow weaving should work (typically you'll have 2-3 stacks, unless Troll.) And the best wand (quest or boss) for 18-31 is shadow (alliance may need to be 20 to get it).
---
Look at the trees at some time and what you get. Don't just think well this is what i did or was told. Try things out and think about it. End game sure . But most people haven't attempted holy or disc leveling. But of the people who do they advocate pretty well for it. A few sites that aren't using the same copy paste guide over and over advocate disc over holy which does make sense.
---
anyone knows where it shows the crit chance in the stat window ?
---
[Yahaaaar, matey!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EfW9znJYjw)
---
They did that because alliance numbers are bleeding to shit on retail. That's what happens when you give one faction significant advantages for long stretches of time. All the high end players switch factions and it becomes a positive feedback loop. For all the shit people cry about EMFH, Horde has had many more advantages across both pvp and pve during wow's history.
---
I don’t think engineering is mandatory for pve. It has a lot of cool gadgets and stuff but I think it has more benefits for pvp.
---
Yeah but they just logout when  they're out of rested xp and get it all back again. Sure you're not winning server firsts with this method but low /played. Definatly.

THIS TIMES A MILLION. My friends and I have been talking about this, and if they were to approach classic in this way, oh god. PLEASE.
---
I too want vanilla as it was. Im playing right now without any addon. I just don't understand why some people scream no changes and are fully against Quest helper for example but then all download questie. Makes no sense.
---
“Battled for control Azeroth” 
---
Just me or does this not make grammatical sense?
---
Considering that you are taller than all the other races in the game, their opinion shouldn't bother you, coming from so far down below =)
---
https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/wowpedia/3/3a/WoW_Manual_-_height_chart.png
---
Gaming has changed. New gamers are different than us.
---
When I started gaming I was content with playing the first couple levels of super mario bros for months without ever finishing it because it was too hard for my 7 year old self.
---
Years later we have games on autopilot because the new age gamers cannot cope with difficulty.
---
When I started online gaming I played CS 1.5 for years, hours a day, because I loved the gameplay. When they released CS:GO it tanked super hard until thwy introduced lootboxes and skins, because the new age 'gamers' need gambling in their games to consider them fun.
---
I honestly dont understand how you can think success of a game 15 years ago means that it would be equally successful nowadays without any changes.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
I'm not saying it won't, because I don't know. I just think it's ridiculous that you think you know. Even if it becomes wildly popular, I'd attribute your being correct solely to luck. Because there os no way in fucking hell that you have any data to back up your claim that classic wow wouod be successful with the new generation of gamers and/or that so many old gamers will have the time and will to STICK WITH IT for years again.
---
You don't know, neither do I. We both hope. Don't pretend you know, it's absolutely ridiculous. You did 0 market research and rely on 15 year old data. Every scientist or market researcher would laugh you out of the building for claiming you can extrapolate modern target audience behaviour from 15 years old data. FIFTEEN YEARS OLD DATA.
---
Once more, I want classic to be a success. It's not me bashing the game at all. I love classic, I played on pservers, I wildly argued for it's release and against the rose tinted goggles uber-morons. The pserver community is the best data we had but those are a comparatively small audience. Add some people who didn't play on them because illegal or lack of knowledge and some who never considered it before the official release at all. How many those will be? How the fuck would you know. I don't. I'm not saying I know, I just think it's ridiculous that you claim you do. Unless you work for Blizz and did statistically relevant research on the subject you're just talking straight out of your ass.
---
Yea, that's a good point about another druid picking it up. 
---
I also feel like Imp Thorns in 5 mans would be where it shines the most as you'll likely be taking multiple mobs more often than in a raid setting. Although, in a raid setting you will be less able to use Enrage because of lower survivability. I'm not sure either talents lends itself to a raid environment very well.
---
If you wanna be succesfull at the end game, bind everything. Or continue your backpedaling adventures :)
---
Yeah this 1440p 144hz Dell monitor I got has some amazing color display, my last 1440p monitor was so dull in comparison
---
Pretty used to the "BfA is shit, welcome classic" posts by now, but that is a new one.
---
Upvoted =)
---
Like where? Australia?
---
that thorns buff showing he has love from both continents. beautiful
---
Let's say I did want to use questie (I won't, at least for my first 5 60s lol). Why would I want *everybody* to be forced into that addon's functionality, JUST because I wanted to use it? Some people want to use the addon, but think it's better for the sake of the game for it to not have that level of handholding *built in*.
---
Of course people like us are out there. It's just ridiculour to claim to know how many.
---
I forgot about Nyhm holy shit I LOVED his content and all of Machinima back in the day!
---
This a 100x please, Blizzard.
---
Im open for entierly new things as well.
---
Thats actually something i look forward to, maybe getting arena. Maybe getting new raid tiers. Maybe getting some class balance.
---
I understand that people want it to be "vanilla" and im fine with it being that for a while, but at some point just doing naxx over and over wont be fun anymore.
---
The new raid tiers do not even have to be above naxx. They could do more raids like ZG - raids ment to help people gear up for the "real" raids.
---
Having a 20 man raid that drops gear more statted towards prot pallys, ele shamans, ret pallys etc. would be really cool. Because i dont think there is much balance needed to make these specs good. Just having some decent gear would be enough.
---
What probably happen is you died and you got put into another layer.

What's the oppinion I'm pushing?

What's the data you're using to gauge classic wows long term success? Have you done or reviewed any recent target audience research on classic wow?

How old are you?

Amen. This is exactly what needs to happen.
---
He didn’t have a Twink in Vanilla 😂
---
Oh snap I remember you Ragma!
---
Historically tauren have been hunted by humans.
---
Tauren and night elves are really close together. Dwarves, gnomes and humans on the other hand...
---
Ironic
---
Plus he's admitted he was wrong about it.  There's a good reason it was him who announced Classic two years ago, talking about all the different ice cream flavours.
---
Completely love the last paragraph, I’ve had the same thoughts. Definitely not naxx level gear, but gear that would make some of the other specs viable at end game
---
They won’t add new content. If they ever decide there is a need for something after classic it will be TBC.
---
Dam son.
---
oof
---
Why do you say that?

Chen Stormstout (Pandaren hero in wc3) was really cool.

My absolute favorite will always be [ROFLMAO!](https://youtu.be/iEWgs6YQR9A) by Oxhorn. I pull them up on YouTube every once in awhile just to remember how silly things could be.

Throw a serpent sting on a mob they’re fighting :)
---
They probably worked on these dungeons for way longer than they were in the alpha/beta builds tho.
---
Modelling a dungeon is not an easy task.
---
You can only see your crit chance in the spellbook
---
I got to lvl 60 as a hunter 1 week before TBC. I have lvled both mage and warlock on pservers (never to max) and I like both classes equally. Your post made me reconsider what to lvl hmmm...
---
I ended up ordering some Oxhorn merch for my sister at the time, and when she came to visit for New Years, she had the shirt on and I swear I nearly cried

Just a warning, I had that flag once and it turned purple after a while for some reason. Just letting you know alliance scum. :)
---
I can't belive that I missed the event at the end, I played the stress test for *almost* 24 hours and really fucking enjoyed myself, but I had to call it quits an hour and 10 minutes before the end - and then all this fun stuff happened. Damn.
---
If night elves came from trolls, how come there are still trolls?
---
Checkmate, eluneists.
---
Do you want Classic? If your answer is yes, you support no changes. If you want changes, you don't want Classic.
---
That's just not true at all. There are tons of people leveling allied races, people doing world quests, invasions and just generally sitting around in major cities.
---
Every expansion you should start over imo. Pancake philosophy got us where we are.
---
Mine was \[Chained Essence of Eranikus\]
---
Just that general area. I kind of see every place that centers around a specific race a region. Dwarfs and Gnomes all started in that region I guess. 
---
Ironforge was my first holy sheet that's massive impression of the game. Just incredible size and scale to everything.
---
Yep, it's a catastrophe!
---
The only PvP feature I would want added to a second iteration of classic wow, classic+, would be someway of curbing premade dodging. 
---
Dodging removes the only element of skill from the PvP rank grind: how quickly can you beat good organized opponents so that you can get back to farming 7-10 min games? 
---
Outside of it just being shit sportsmanship, cowardly, and in direct conflict with the spirit and intent of PvP, it’s shitty boring gameplay for the team doing it. I’d imagine most of them aren’t bad players who know they can’t win a fair fight, they just legitimately believe that if they don’t others still will and that will put them at a disadvantage. 
---
If you don’t enjoy actual competitive PvP, why torture yourself with the 3 mo 18hour a day grind?
---
Personally, I’d want some complete overhaul that promoted both skill and time investment, but ditching the honor system is straying very far away from certain elements of what makes classic classic. 
---
All that said, I think it’s really important for the set of server we are on now to be no changes forever. The world and fans deserve ‘an as real as it was’ server. I think those servers should reroll after naxx with characters dumped to a legacy realm. There should be at least 1 classic nochanges progression server forever—or as long as blizzard is a company, their fortunes are quite literally due to that product. From 300 to 4300 as a result of WoW.
---
This one goes into the save folder. Great stuff guys!
---
feel free to screenshot this and !remindme
---
Classic will overtake retail and retail will go into freefall within 2-3 years
---
guaranteed.
---
there are no more stories worth telling in retail
---
Classic means you can eventually re experience all the old content with fresh eyes. that has way more appeal than another hastily generated set of quests and spins on the loot-around-about that bfa offers.
---
No more asinine half cocked stories that shit on lore and character development.
---
People can experience gruul all over again, BT, illidan, arthas etc etc
---
its a fucking goldmine
---
Hunters biggest issues are :
---
1. Feeding Pet Early - You need to feed a lot him to gain loyality levels and avoid to lose him, also Happy Pet = More DMG and basically a better levelling.
---
Especially if you are alliance and want to swap at some point to a Screecher Pet.
---
2. Ammo - Pretty self explanatory, a trick is ofc to put arrows in an action bar slot so you can see them always
---
We all want? Since when do you speak for everyone. People are just excited to have the game they way it was.  Adding new content takes away from what made vanilla wow special.
---
but you could make a new character in bfa and have the same experience.
---
in most guilds it is not mandatory.
---
it is often mandatory in hardcore guilds and if not its recommended.
---
Ah my friend, you have come at a great time.  Today we have a sale on crocolisk scales.  You do not even have to carry them, they will follow you home.  We will only charge a small extra fee for the convenience.  Wait, where are you going?
---
He's the mod Ash of classic.
---
night elf!
---
I remember a warrior in ICC getting so salty because we kept giving him wisdom, clicking it off and asking for might.
---
We had enough paladins to give every class every buff. He already had might. And Kings. And Sanc...
---
I bet it kept aggro quite a bit better after that huh? :)
---
Flying mounts, or low level mounts in general (you can't buff someone running past you on a road if you are mounted).
---
Blind faith or be banned!!! Don't pierce our bubble!!!
---
nah classic is gonna save wow from its demise
---
its the best mmorpg ever made
---
I'm deciding between Troll Hunter or Orc Warrior. Or even Orc Hunter. Maybe Hunter as I don't really want to be expected to tank. But then again,  Orc Warrior was the first character I ever levelled.

Dude you don't have the BIS dagger from the Thrall quest.... The most important BIS item for your rogue....

Anyone else wonder how they light those chandelier lanterns? They seem pretty hard to get to.
---
You can't Shadowmeld in combat in Classic.
---
I'm torn between Priest and Paladin. I played classic since launch and mained a horde druid so I'm familiar with end game healing, really enjoyed it and would like to perform this role again. 
---
I really like being the supporting class that's keeps the group alive. I don't care about doing big crits or damage meters and PvE is definitely more my focus than PvP. However, I don't want to completely gimp myself when it comes to grinding, wpvp and team pvp at 60 as I'm going to have far less time to play this time around and the focus will be on less raiding and more having fun doing odd dungeons and BG here and there (still want to do a bit of raiding if possible). I don't want to respec regularly.
---
I'm currently leveling a Priest on a pserver and so far it seems good. I'm going shadow spec for the leveling process with the full anticipation of switching to disc/holy at 60. I like that I have practically zero downtime and do pretty good DPS. My concern is that when I respec at 60 my utility outside of dungeons plummets and it will take me forever to grind anything. Is a healing focused priest still able to perform well in team PvP and not spend hours grinding money and mats?
---
When it comes to paladins I'm completely in the dark. Never played one or with one. My plan is to try one out before classic hits and see how it plays. Main complaint I have seen is that they are slow as hell to level and a bit boring throughout. I do like the crazy utility they bring to a group through auras and blessings and the fact they are really hard to kill in group PvP. Free mount is also nice as is the potential to tank smaller instances with correct gear. Are the same specs used for healing viable to PvP and grinding?
---
Priest 
---
Pros
---
Decent leveling speed
---
Great team role
---
Can melt faces in PvP
---
Good skill repertoire
---
Cons
---
Squishy
---
Easy to kill in grp PvP?
---
Paladin
---
Great healing and utility
---
Free mount
---
Option to tank
---
Beast in team PvP
---
Less competition for gear
---
Slow and boring
---
Would groups prefer a priest for healing?
---
What are reddits thoughts?
---
Yes please.
---
I refuse to answer on the grounds that the answer may serve to incriminate me
---
&gt; All the high-end players switch factions and it becomes a positive feedback loop.
---
And what does that has to do with anything, how does Mythic World First influences 99.9% of players? A better racial is an equivalent of what? 3 ilvl? With how easy getting raid tier gear is, in an avarage raiding guild, this is just a poor excuse for incompetence.
---
And PvP? Humans had the most OP racial (since the Orks Stun resist got nerfed in BC and then to the ground in Wotlk) for years, and just now it got nerfed, suddenly oh the humanity, the imbalance.
---
Thanks, I will update that!
---
Sure buddy, 
---
So action cam is a weird type of camera settings that makes the gameplay a little more immersive. It's hard to explain it without you just experiencing it yourself. Essentially though, if action cam is enabled; the camera shakes a little with every attack. It's off centered a little as well, and focuses on the enemy instead of your character. It makes the fights more immersive especially for melee classes. Also, the further zoomed in you are the better the cam works. Here are the commands for it. Just type them into chat.
---
 /console ActionCam full  
---
Note: There are 4 options for this:  
---
basic - Basic ActionCam  
---
full - All action cam features on  
---
off - Disable action cam features  
---
default - Default ActionCam settings 
---
You can also make macros with these typed into them so you can easily switch back and forth depending on your situation.
---
Don’t worry. There are people who understood what you meant. When the release date was announced I HYPED the fuck up. But that energy doesn’t last for months on end. Don’t get it twisted, I’m excited but I’m not jumping out of my pants excited like I was two weeks(?) ago. When it gets to about a week I’ll be hella hyped again I’m sure.
---
Why is that? Just more players on horde so they have to incentivize alliance?
---
Its only arrogant and offensive if you can't handle cold hard truths. Seems to be a common thing amongst gamers. 
---
Devs and publishers need to regularly kiss their asses otherwise you get a bunch of manchildren crying about how someone was mean to them and how as the customer they are always right. 
---
Its like being locked in a room of Karens.
---
people do this back then with relative ease , it is called being inside a guild and acting like guildmates when some players needed help in some dungeon and vice versa.. 
---
maybe it's been too long for some ppl but i remember back then guildies help each other more than today's guild where everyone can level solo easily and do not need guildie help..
---
that's why i will be joining a casual friendly mature guild in vanilla
---

---
Not going to share specifics as I don't want to spread possibilities to grief, but they all revolve around the ability to lock-out quest objects and NPCs indefinitely, making it impossible to do certain quests.
---
Well, WoW initially went around the issue of the hair physics by animating them by hand. Look at the ponytail or the dwarf hairstyles: the movement is always the same, because they're manually animated and saved in the model itself.
---
The newer models I think have basic physics but nothing crazy.
---
Bingo!
---
r/Fortnite learns that lesson during every major patch.
---
Well you finally attracted all the adults

TB is also (in my experience) less likely to be raided by the Alliance Scum, making it markedly safer then Org and UC.

---
You're not going to be doing any DPS as a paladin (and you don't want to anyway, their damage is just auto attacks and judgement).
---
Paladins are healers, and really good ones. For everything else they are subpar at best and dead weight at worst.
---
Choose another class if you want to melee DPS, brother.
---
What makes you think "we all want" this? :s   
---
I feel like majority is for the #nochanges movement.
---
Those people were treated like shit because they generally have bad attitudes and wanted to be dicks to everyone just enjoying wow as it was.
---
Everyone else covered the main bits but I'd add that thunderclap is totally worth using in certain situations while tanking, but it does nothing for your agro really. More of a slight defensive improvement on melee heavy pulls.
---
I legit sat in game last night semi afk outside an inn buffing everyone that passed with Fortitude - I had a great time and spoke with more people in that short time during the stress test than I had in retail wow in a year ❤️

The shaman 11 point resto talent was an exact copy of that trait for a long time. I would imagine that a troll shaman who picked it up and geared as much spirit + dps stats as he could while leveling would be unkillable by almost any single normal mob. Probably only auto attacking with the occasional healing stream, searing, stoneskin totem(or other totems and shocks if needed). Pull and drop totems then just auto attack while the five sec rule kicks in and never have to eat or drink in 95% of leveling situations. I would love to see a video of something like this if one exists lol
---
in addition to being able to heal fine in a dps spec, you can level fine in a heal spec. I wouldn't overthink it
---
I would like to play a class that has high outplay potential in pvp. I’m not worried about skill cap, as I am willing to learn and dedicate time to getting better.
---
Almost certainly alliance again. I don't really like any of the horde races visually (except for orcs I guess), but their zone visual design is extremely off-putting to me (Durotar still makes my eyes bleed), and all their capitals don't compare to IF in any way.
---
I wasn't alone in doing this and they fixed it fairly quickly haha.
---
&gt; after blizzard told everyone they wouldn't do expansions since we paid monthly for content updates
---
Did they really say that?
---
I feel kind of conflicted..the class I consider my Main/Favorite is still Shaman but I'm not going to main it in classic. Hell I'm probably not even going Horde.
---
Nailed it. They've got all the assets and the framework of TBC and Wrath sitting there ready to be crafted into truly great expansions (actual expansions, not replacements).
---
What if we went into Outland as 60s and never gained a level? Instead we'd gain the ability to resist fel energy and so the leveling process would actually mostly leave our character the same, just with high fel defense. 
---
Then in WotLK we'd still be 60. There we would slowly gain frost and blight resistance as we leveled. 
---
Maybe that fel, frost, and blight resistance is a bar we level up. Maybe it's in items attached to gear. Maybe it's in temporary buffs. Maybe it's in class spells. Perhaps it's not just defensive. Perhaps we learn to identify vulnerabilities of users of these energies and so our attacks are more effective in the relevant instances. 
---
Horizontal growth. We take our new insights into the relevant energies of the current dungeons and raids and work through the content....and then we go farm Dreamfoil and lose a PvP fight to a guy in in BWL gear. The dream.
---
he said above that it's unlikely that he swapped layer as the druid would have needed to gone with him as well when not in the same party
---
If I follow through with warrior I'll be doing the mining/BS grind for max RP and leveling gear. If I flip-flop to rogue like I'm considering I'll do herb/alch

Going full Cthulhu mode in retail the 9.0 expansion could be the end of the world bringing 10.0 to a new thing :) all is needed is Pyromancer ad their lead story designer :)

---
Omg... I hated gnomergan so much
---
I agree!
---
Christ, no. Ignoring that this "guide" talks about TBC talents, it still has glaring mistakes. 
---
If you spend 10 seconds in iceblock, you can't blink into range to nova the hunter afterwards unless he is an actual retard. 
---
You won't even be in his dead zone at this point, so you're now dazed, the pet is coming for you, and will stun you leaving you with no escape. 3 seconds of getting destroyed by a BW pet and a full hunter rotation while he runs to max range again, and the mage is on 10-20% hp with no blink and no block.
---
It's very easy to theorycraft when you're writing like the hunter is literally not doing anything. At equal skill and equal gear, BM hunter wins.
---
All your base are belong to me!
---
Only blizzards internal numbers and projections which we dont have access too will be relevant here. This has never been quite done in this style of game and I would say runescape is too fundamentally different in lifecycle to compare too
---
There is no way for anyone to really know and the only way to get any real educated guess requires player engagement data only blizzard has access too.
---
Im 27 and run my own software business. I also have been doing very well with video game company option trading. I made a MASSIVE bet on EA calls from December 26 to the day before EA earnings call and doubled up on a daily call. I correctly predicted EA was massivelt undervalued at $73 a share and road calls to $106 making well over 600% returns in a few months. I posted about this for months on /r/wallstreetbets

A good part of TBC was that there was no catchup mechanics for professions. If you wanted that new jewelcrafting profession, best of go get a buttload of mithril and thorium

TLDR: Roll Horde ;)
---
Don't you get a quest that sends you there?
---
It's spelled sporadic!
---
My two cents; level your main first. I think you'll regret leveling a char you don't care to main to 60 before starting your 'real' character. It's a long journey to cap.
---
I always thought d3 was first and then wow copied it from d3. I looked at d3 as a testing ground for wow developers which would explain why it wasn't shut down yet.
---
Someone ELI5?
---
Cancel casting?
---
HAHAH
---
Because we don’t want any changes dude. Even colourblind mode is annoying me and the interface layout, I DONT WANT ANYMORE CHANGES DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
---
EMFH didn't even exist until Wrath, and it was added as a response to the fact that Horde racials were OP as fuck in pvp in vanilla and BC, so I'm not sure what makes you think Horde needs a "boost" in classic.
---
Yes. That's how they stated it in the beginning. It's hard pressed info from the formative years of the internet. 
---
It's what determined the subscription in the first place that we would be paying for future content.
---
Do you not bother picking a dollar up off the ground if you walk by it? This is basically free money for them. Maybe it's not as much as their other stuff, but still.
---
Why would you bind your primary skills to F1-6 though?
---
Pretty closed minded, man, to give ultimatums. There's already been changes and more to come, so I guess with that logic we're not getting classic.
---
That class you're talking about is disrespected because there so many bad hunters = huntards. However a good hunter is something extremely dangerous in PvP and useful in PvE, even in the later raids. Almost every guild is thirsty for actually good hunters because there's so few of them.
---
I remember lots of these exploits in WSG, and people would get banned for using them. As authentic as it is, this would ruin warsong gulch because it would just turn into a stalemate when both flags are in such spots.
---
I'm sure this falls into the category of "exploits" which is the one thing they said they would make exceptions for in terms of authenticity. Jumping yourself under stormwind is entirely harmless, but this kind of jumping breaks the game mode.
---
Does anyone know if the Menethil to Westfall shortcut works?
---
Naga-na happen. Retail would riot if they added Naga class to classic that they don’t have.
---
How were warlocks at fresh 60 with not much gear in PVE and PvP ?
---
warlocks do have a threat drop, SS self, die and you have dropped threat
---
Threat Capped alliance side as well.
---
Alliance
---
I don't really want to defend them but Ion explicitly stated that layering *will* be turned off come phase 2, no matter the population. Presumably if the server is overpopulated still, there will be queues (and free transfers off).
---
Agreed. I'm all for no changes, or as few as possible, but this is one that should be changed. Same with getting out of Arathi Basin starting room before the game started.
---
But what exactly would that mean? It’s nice to think of, and I’m not a naysayer, but I so often see people discuss the idea of TBC being redone in the same vein as Vanilla, without concrete ideas of how do so such a thing. 
---
How do we stop Azeroth from turning into a ghost town in the wake of Outlands? 
---
Would the Hybrids receive the love they deserved in TBC, or would that not be considered “Truly Vanilla”?
---
I would love to see some suggestions on how one could use all the TBC content without breaking away from what made Vanilla, Vanilla.
---
Is it worth it for a human to quest there in addition to Westfall? If so, which one should I do first? I've only ever ran through to get to Wetlands but I'm thinking of checking it out this time around.
---
Nice self-promotion
---
if this was true people would intentionally parry haste the boss by having melee not attack from the front
---
RemindMe! many, many months
---
Flying mounts didn’t kill it since it was only in Outland. LFG/LFR killed wow. It removed the social aspect. Then slowly making everything solvable in cata continued the destruction of the need to interact with others

Sounds like something Esfands reddit alt would say

Herb/Mining and riding circles in EPL while I advertise my strat:live runs.

Listening to the players never went wrong before.
---
At some point during the making of the guide, I was looking at Joana's guide for inspiration. I believe he is also Working on a Aliance version. If I'm lucky I will not have to make anything and before launch I can follow his.
---
And half the thread would be spent on calling out your misspelling instead of the actual content - sounds like a good call.
---
I'd just add arenas tbh. You don't even need to give rewards for it, but it could be super interesting to have arenas in classic ^^
---
He does have one on retail since MoP. Adding a plaque in SW and Org would be best.
---
I like it considering how open the rest of Ashenvale was - it was a good contrast.
---
And sorry, NE /Night Elf. I was trying to say it was the equivalent of Deadmine and Humans. 
---
Unless you made the suicide journey through Wetlands!
---
There's a custom game in WC3 called survival chaos. They do factions well there I think. They are Human, NE, Orc, Fel Orc, Naga, Undead, Blood Elf, Tauren, Troll, Dwarf, and Rogue (like human mercs).
---
Generally won't work, since they don't stack with motw D:
---
Yes but everything is relative right?  A dollar to most people is a lot more than $1.1M is to them.
---
Obviously they're not just writing off $1.1M, I'm being devil's advocate for the sake of showing that they're doing this for other reasons as well.

I never played wow with lfg available. I just asked in the town chat if I remember correctly

Deciding between lock, rogue and hunter.
---
I plan on focusing PvP mostly. All kinds of PvP, but I plan on raiding, dungeons as well. They just won't be my top priority. I enjoy being able to solo things, but I also enjoy being useful to my group. And I'm hoping for something that has kinda fun playstyle (for vanilla standards of course).
---
I played lock back in the actual vanilla but I don't remember it that much anyway, and I've been a DK main since Wotlk.
---
He is not a GM. Omar Gonzalez is the software engineer who proved that WoW clasaic is feasible to Blizz execs by actually developing a proof of concept build by himself during a few weeks.

Gnome for pvp because of Escape Artist.

(+ hilarious death animation as a bonus!)

You know what? At this point, I have almost 0 faith in blizzard.

Let the monkeys run the zoo atleast I'll have fun for once.

Could be because its different people making the decisions of what to spawn.
---
All hail the Za lord!
---
Also dungeon finder was no where what LFG was dungeon finder was just a way to maybe find someone and start the conversation not just throw you in a group and teleport you there. Also dungeons in BC requires communication and CC. Mobs would 1-2 hit anyone but the tank a broken CC on trash could wipe a whole group.
---
If they create new content, I would like to see the jump in power of items between expansions be lower. To not replace lvl 60 gear with greens at lvl 65 for example
---
Remember when literally used to mean literally? And then idiots on the internet used it so much that it now has no meaning? That's toxic. It's a word that's thrown around by crybabies that get upset when they read mean things on the internet. Then people call *those* people toxic for complaining about it, then someone jumps in and says they're *all* toxic. Everyone's toxic.
---
 /rant
---
Whoops, it seems you're right. Whatever thread I read must've been mistaken.
---
I most definitely disagree with your statement of newer gamers not liking difficulty. You also seem to have pulled that statement and your thoughts on new gamers requiring gambling to enjoy games, out of nowhere. For example, Im 17, I started wow in wrath and played til wod, came back and went hard in legion. Vanilla wow has been the most enjoyable so far. Nostalgia is not the driving factor for me and likely others, its simply that the game was good. It feels like an mmo, stuff isn’t freely given, theres a need for community interaction and it keeps you on your toes as you play. Even if aspects such as community aren’t as good as before, the core game is solid. You also seem to have gotten quite mad over this for some reason. Its alright man, let them voice their opinions and then consider responding in a civil manner, you may get a good discussion out of it and not have to preemptively mention how you will be downvoted. While i do agree that its hard to say what will happen, I also think its extremely likely that a dedicated classic community will form. From experiences of my family members, who you could consider old age gamers (They started in TBC), ive seen that there are many appealing aspects to classic, for many types of people. For example, my dad looks forward to the simple things such as questing and taking his time exploring. Im not saying i have a huge folder or statistics lying around but, surely they aren’t the only people like that.
---
There are many cool ideas to brainstorm but right now I just wanna play Vanilla. That's all, thanks.
---
Hell yes This
---
Thanks for the heads up. That means its not related with WSG only.
---
I hope people report this ingame.
---
Literally didn't stop having a meaning just because people use it wrong. I mean I get what you're saying, but toxic is still a good way of describing a community (ie League of Legends).
---
Actually I checked, it was darkshore, but indeed I had to travel all the way from darkshore then ashenvale to retrieve my corpse!
---
We Omars will rule the world one day.
---
&gt;I would say I'm far more qualified
---
Considering what you write in this post is exactly what I am saying (we cannot know because we don't have the data and anyone who claims they know is a tool) but you somehow managed to reply to me like I am arguing a different point makes me highly question your reading comprehension skills and by extend the entire rest of your story.
---
Obviously you left out the most important answer to my question about what point you are alleging me to make. Because in that post and others I have made in this thread it would become pretty clear to anyone with basic english skills that I do not claim to know whether classic will be successful and that anyone who claims they know is talking out of their ass.
---
The fact that you flaunt your job and money just makes you look like a fucking arrogant idiot and the fact you actually answered with your age (like that means anything) and ask me for my job (like I'm gonna give personal information to some arrogant tool who thinks his paycheck means anything to anyone LOL) just makes me regret engaging in conversation with you in the first place.
---
Good luck with your money. Unluckily it cannot buy you a brain. Maybe some reading comprehension lessons, though.
---
Not a bug.
---
Never experienced the old world as I only started back in Cata. But Im very excited to experience it for the first time with my friend who started in MoP.
---
You can help random people by drawing aggro from them! Ir simply helping them in a pinch. I did that yesterday when someone was ganked by 2 mobs while fighting another. Vanilla and older expansions in general make the game feel like a mmo again not like its current retail state.
---
Wtb beta invite
---
All the other posts here on reddit?
---
A lot of what came out in Bc and Wrath and Cata was content shelved from vanilla. 
---
Make karazhan a 20m raid situated between aq40 and naxx in difficulty and reward (like zg was to mc and aq20 was to bwl). 
---
Take grim batol and make a dwarf/dragon raid out of that. 
---
Maybe even include Bc outdoor content but redo the profession materials so you will need Bc mats and classic Azeroth mats keeping people moving in the world. 
---
Wasn’t emerald nightmare/dream supposed to be a raid? Wasn’t it also one of the most poorly received raids of modern WoW? Redo that as the 40 man after Naxx (put grim Batol as a 20m  after emerald revamp as the naxx catch up).
---
Metzen himself thought up the following raids/high level dungeons for classic in 2001: Alextrasza (island north of EK, east of Blood Elves), cathedral (different than SM) on western side of tirisfal, Aerie Arathi/Hinterlands, Dragonmaw north of grim batol in wetlands, tol Barad, Karazhan, nethergarde mine/keep, diamond mines stv, hyjal, 1000 needles, grotto dungeon dustwallow marsh, nozdormu tanaris, uldum tanaris, flamerift barrens/stonetalon/ashenvale.
---
Some of that was repurposed into other vanilla assets, others scraped entirely and some didn’t get into the game at all, others are the massive outdoor mines/caves and unique areas. 
---

---
You have changes like AV which are in the realm of 1.0 to 1.12.1 and infrastructure changes to the servers like layering and colorblind mode for basically vision impaired/ disabled people. 
---
There are simply no QoL changes or introductions of ingame mechanics from later iterations of the game.
---
Saying otherwise is simply wrong. Spellbatching and tauren melee range are the best indications on what the dev team wants. A faithful recreation of 2006 era vanilla WoW.
---
One of my friends found your post and told me about it. Appreciate the call out =). I don't have a guide for ZF / BRD keys yet, but I definitely have them on my to do board now, and the UBRS key.

Will work on ZF mallet tomorrow night and hopefully have it up by Sunday!

Hunter
---
Solo dungeons?
---
I played both and I agree with myself.
---
I even started during BC so my nostalgia should weigh in it favour. Still doesnt beat Vanilla.
---
Geez. I didn't know you could spawn in a darkshore graveyard. Wonder if that was changed by 1.12 &gt;_&gt;
---
So youre telling me Omar is our religion now? Fair enough.
---
I did this in 2006 on alliance side all the time. fun to see all those cata kids going wtf on classic
---
I've killed that big ole cow 3 or 4 times now and I'll kill it again!
---
&gt; You also seem to have pulled that statement and your thoughts on new gamers requiring gambling to enjoy games, out of nowhere.
---
No I didn't. The market pretty clearly shows this. And I included the example of CS:GO. Go to the Apex Legends subreddit and see people crying out for more cosmetics. 
---
Sure you can ignore everything that is happening and say there is no proof, but at the end of the day there is plenty proof that the landscape of gaming has changed to accomodate a wider, more casual (also more volatile) audience.
---
At the end of the day, though, my statement is "WE DO NOT KNOW" which includes I don't know. Classic could absolutely become wildly popular, but neither I nor you know and you claiming you do know is ridiculous.
---
Undead Supremacist.
---
Yeah his chat goes by so damn fast now
---
Just the help I need!
---
I'm hardstuck between priest, warlock, mage or warrior.
---
First of all, I find it really exciting to master a hard class and the possibility to make clutch plays in pvp and big dmg/heals in pve. I prefer to control fights and make decisions about targets. Teamplay is a huge part of the game for me. I also like the feeling of playing a unique class. 
---
I already have a tons of experience with both 60' warrior, priest and warlock from pserver.
---
When I play warrior I love the feeling of destroying everything in pvp and charge into battle. The freedom of having tankgear and possiblity to do that you want in the game when you want it.
---
When I play priest and warlock I love the feeling of control in the fights with fears, dispels and dmg. Nothing better than a insta dispel on a friendly warrior against a mage or destroy another players gameplay with fear spam and dots. I don't mind healing in pve/pvp, but I fear my ego desire the dmg aspect of the game.
---
Pretty much nailed it
---
Those are some amazing shots! Thanks for sharing it with us :)
---
I wish I could´ve been there but oh well :P Sleep/Work are ruling my life now :D
---
I never said Horde needs any boost in classic. In fact, I think Horde racials were quite OP in vanilla and adding EMFH would be a good solution to that issue for classic. 
---
All I said is that from my perspective (and it is probably skewed since I've never experienced the problems from the other perspective), when there's imbalance that favorites Horde, Blizzard starts to take actions ASAP, when it's the other way around, they take their sweet time and wait an expansion or three.
---
That "20% bonus and free items" situation is a perfect example. In a 15 year long history of WoW it's the first situation when Blizzard said: "since you're disadvantaged, there's some bonus to boost morale and attract more players". It's also the first time when Horde is heavily in the lead. It's been now 6 months, and I don't see any changes coming in 8.2 in that regard. Imagine for a moment what would happen if in BC Horde would get straight up experience bonus of even 5%.
---
I personally prefer bald for all the male models, but I too have noticed the uprising of the Mcconnell haircut, and I would attribute it to his coolness.
---
You get a +20 XP buff and a rep buff if you toggle pvp when you do stuff out in the world, but it's only for the faction that has the least amount of players doing it.  Since Horde has more people and more people doing world pvp so the Alliance is incentivized with this mechanic to have pvp toggled on.  They implemented this when they removed World pvp realms and just went with PvE and RP realms.  It's supposed to promote world pvp.
---
Alliance doesn't always have it since it balances out every 7 or so hours
---
The scourge invasion on Quel Thalas killed 90% of the kingdom. There should be a lot more risen elves than portrayed ingame.
---
Why would it be unwarranted? They exploited a bug to their own advantage at the detriment of the remaining players who tried to defeat the Lich King in the way it was meant to be done. Of course they should be banned.
---
That's more interesting than reposting some old meme shitting on current wow
---
Oh man.  So many places like this.  I miss Loch Modan.  I miss the Salt Flats and Mirage Raceway.  I miss the little village on the edge of the ocean in Tanaris.  I miss the Linken questline.   Looking forward to seeing this all again.
---
Organise to meet up at Barrens, for example, rather than levelling from level 1 together.
---
Tbh really isnt. Oh i got thorns today. Wtf really? Halleluja.
---
When I was a warrior I was sad I couldn't buff people
---
Maybe a large portion of those players will simply feel like Vanilla is a superior game than retail.. And this seems to be the opinion of most of the people playing the beta
---
I want to come out of stealth and stab people. Who should I play? 
---
I was thinking pally.
---
Pretty easy Barrens quest, The Disruption Ends, would give you a BIS belt.
---
I wouldn't be afraid... I mean you ARE the Ugandan Bruce Lee.
---
I never said I knew, I voiced my thoughts on what I think could happen. One point that I guess didn’t get across is that classic actually does have stuff for casual players. I also really don’t think its fair to say that because games have gambling or loot box aspects, new gamers need those aspects. Theres been many times actually where reddit has gotten upset because of loot boxes.
---
was saying to a friend, i really hope he is getting a good serving of humble pie over that and realises that the players know what they want and he should listen to them, doubt he will as sometimes what the players want doesn't make the most money but we can live in hope
---
By wanting to nerf elemental shamans in PvP indirectly.
---
Shamans are borderline OP in PvP. By making them raidviable you will tweak metrics that spill over into PvP.
---
An elemental that does not go oom? An elemental making use of curse of elements now not critting for 4k in 2 GCDs but for 6k?   
---
Eles would have to be nerfed in PvP to make them viable in PvE.
---
A big phat no from me.
---
There are so many warriors abusing heroic strike. I don't want to use it because I don't feel heroic but it gives them an unfair advantage. When is Blizzard going to ban them?
---
It 's the only fair thing to do as they achieve an unfair, unintended advantage over players who do not use their spells.
---
Would be cool if after people had Naxx on farm they'd do an alternate take where they "finish" vanilla instead of going for an expansion. Like add Gilneas as a high level zone with a new 5-man, make Grim Batol a raid, add a quest to cleanse Ashbringer, do present-day Mount Hyjal, etc.
---
Tailoring for bags , Enchanting to D/E stuff and making Wands
---
Make it horizontal content instead of vertical. Just don't increase the level cap and Azeroth will still have it's place.
---
Just do 20men split runs. Double the loot for everyone while making it quite difficult for all people involved.
---
 Can you explain what you mean by proof of concept?    
---
Aren't private servers proof it's possible already?    
---
I'm pretty new to classic so I haven't been following but I do know private servers aren't perfect.
---
But that's exactly my point, how is you giving me a Google link "toxic"? In what way is that "poisonous"? It's such an exaggeration term used when people do the most menial things. I think what bothers me the most is how people seem to use it in a way that implies it's somehow objective. I'd call anyone that uses the word toxic toxic by their own definition, for reducing conversation to name calling. 
---
I could also be cranky because I ran out of coffee and it's early, and I'm way overthinking it.
---
druid is better
---
she can stealth , she can dps , she can tank , she can heal and she got free travel form
---
Wasn’t token gear minimal in the beginning of tbc? It wasn’t until sunwell where it went over the top that I recall.
---
You could also put the points into greater bash for better cc on trash
---
Personally I would make a new character and play together from the start, you can always play your main afterwards 
---
Just get your main as far as possible on the release day and relax and chill for the weekend with your friend 
---
For me the real life lan experience fromnfresh outweighs having a rush through content
---
Ora pro nubis Lucifer
---
Wait few levels and people will start asking for diseases removal or decurse :) and then a mage pops up with things like Jungle Remedy and saves someone from an annoying disease too...
---
Bugs arent "authentic".
---
Completely agree with his take on re-releasing expansions and how it's just going to end us right up right where we started, been saying this from the start. I've got confidence in Blizz to lead Classic in the right direction though, based on the stuff Mark's said.
---
what is this constant report on layering as if it is a real issue ? stop reposting this
---
I loved those. People’s tears fueled me. I haven’t played WoW in years... wonder if ole Sul T is still in my bank. My first epic. 🥰
---
Yup sorry my brain said 1% per level but i knew it was .5%
---
We were definitely stressing the servers. Being inside that group was laggy, but as soon as you ran away from the group, it functioned normally. (No skill lag, mobs pulled normally etc..)
---
Frame rate was fine. I was dipping under 60fps at that point, but what do you expect.
---
?
---
It wasn't a suggestion. This was a developer talking about a ton of things they wanted to add to vanilla but cut before it got released.
---
&gt; I'm fail
---
Yes, you are.
---
Like said above, salvation on dps and kings on tanks is going to keep human warriors (with sharpening stones) on top of the threat tables more consistently than windfury totem horde tanks.
---
Alchemy is actually legit on warriors.
---
Killed, not necessarily raised. They didn't come with the intention of adding to their ranks which is why notable figures like Anastarian remain dead. Sylvanas was raised out of spite and she's a notable expection.
---
Yep, we were trying to arrange a massive gurubashi brawl
---
I agree. 
---
The poster I responded to basically defended exploiting by stating that its way different to exploit coding mistakes than to use 3rd party programs to gain unfair advantages. I disagree with that notion and cheating, exploiting, hacking etc. is all the same to me. Gaining an unfair advantage by unintended mechanics.
---
I noticed they did that for the Timewalking vendors in retail, thank god.
---
I ran there on the stress test and jumped off into the water, made me happy to see it again
---
Create an alt to play with him. Group levelling is faster than solo.
---
&gt; There are simply no QoL changes or introductions of ingame mechanics from later iterations of the game.
---
Did you play beta? There are a ton of quality of life changes. Mostly small things like looting and bags.  For example, you can swap bags like in Legion, which you couldn't do in vanilla.  Without a bag being empty you can just move the bad or swap it with a new one (even if stuff is in it).     
---
The modern client gives a lot of small changes.
---
Horde was never an underdog. In fact after BC horde was a superior faction for both pvp and pve. What are you smoking?
---
Troll berserking was king racial of pve.
---
Is that the bow from the raptor quest?
---
Honestly, you have to be a complete fucking idiot to trust blizzard with the future of classic wow with anything other than a static post-Naxx permaserver.
---
my god character boosts are the biggest money grab ever, you would spend less money on the sub needed to level 1-120 than you would spend on a character boost and yet a friend knows someone that brought one for about 5 different character as he "couldn't be bothered to level them" 
---
too many people after instant gratification and not wanting to put in the work to get there

Jesus christ get over it. He obviously knows he was wrong at this point. Unless you're just farming karma.
---
one main for raiding or hardcore stuff , the alt for playing around enjoying the game slowly

I don’t like Alliance but you gotta go alliance for the stress test, that’s where all the GMs spawn raid bosses and the fun memeage is.
---
It would be terrible. That addon makes levelling a joke.
---
I can’t wait to farm a bag full of soul shards everyday
---
It’s true. Most of this stems from people wanting blizzard to be wrong but they have all the data.
---
Gnomeregan has the potential to go wrong on so many occasions, you really need a good group for that one. The time bombs, the alarm bots, jumping down (uh, where did my pet go?), aggroing everything because someone went to close to a ledge or some aoe hit something it shouldn't have, the bombs on the last boss if no one pushes any buttons etc.
---
I loved the theme and the massive size of it, but it could go wrong real fast. Kinda like BRD or Maraudon, amazing instances, varied, fun fights, epic story. But so much potential for drama.
---
Don’t be afraid to say’OOM’ after each pull until everyone gets it and slows down.
---
Which makes it even more annoying when you notice you are lost again.
---
I want to have a raid spot, I don't much care for leveling speed, and no healer classes as I despise healing. PvP server, so I want to be able to hold my own at cap while I do open world stuff. I won't be solo while leveling.
---
(This is just gonna be warrior, isn't it)
---
This will more than likely be in the retail game too.
---
This and many more WSG exploits were in the game until TBC and were used almost every WSG game.
---
People will bash you for this, although people have been using joanas guide as an addon on private server which paired with questie does essentially the same. I perdonally wouldnt use it because i dont think its very efficient on a fresh server and i also dont like following arrows, it messes me up more than looking at the map because it shows a straight line and if you follow the arrow you might end up with a mountain in between you and your objective, the only arrow i use with questie is when i die, but even that is more to know how many yards away i am from my body instead of for the direction, but to each their own
---
King's honour, friend.

Hi, /u/Szalona, your post has been removed as it is seems to be talking about the current stress test. Please use the current [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bui555/stress_test_2_the_megathread_of_omg_why_can_i_not/) instead.
---
Yea because Jagex totally didn't ruin 07scape by adding one hit kill god swords and ruining all social interaction by implementing an auction house.
---
Title of post “post naxx content” isn’t discussing post naxx content?
---
I think if Legion had a stronger difficulty, making community a thing again, we would have had the best xpac period imo! Making collaborating on class questlines mandatory, getting rid of WQ grouping add-ons (just my view, cause they are the cause of this automation of relations)
---
Omar actually sound like one of the old gods
---
That song is so catchy.
---
I was gonna say you’ve missed the H out of TBH, then I got it.
---
Between Vanilla and Cataclysm expansion of wow this damn held back a vast lake between the wetlands zone and the loch modan zone in the eastern kingdoms.
---
During the cataclysm it was destroyed by an angry dragon called Deathwing. Before that, the wetlands used to be a lot less wet. 
---
I think most alliance players remember their first time seeing this dam. I saw it on my night elf hunter while doing the wetlands run.
---
i had a lot of fun leveling with the cute  girlfriend of a guy in my guild during vanilla.
---
we had so many laughs id just play with her when she was on
---
she ended up moving to where i lived and being my gf , cute chick sad it didnt work out
---
My 1 regret in the stress test was not doing more quests in westfall. There are some nice rewards especially from killing the level 14/15 harvesters/watchers
---
I completely remember this being destroyed in the Cataclysm cinematic and had never ever seen the dam before then (despite playing a bit in Vanilla), so I was so excited when I came upon it and was able to actually see this dam for the first time. Simply magnificent.
---
Wait. 
---
So you needed WoW classic to push you to switch to a job that was better in literally every aspect?
---
Yikes
---
I really liked Blackfathom - up to the point where someone would light all candles at once, which sometimes even happened when you warned people beforehand.
---
Lol this is getting out of hand. Ya'll need to calm down with all these beta envy fomo post.
---
Hashtag:Nochanges
---
It's how it was in Vanilla and TBC, it's how it should be in Classic, along with the other WSG jumps.
---
My wife gonna play Human Warlock (she is from a  gnome haters gheto  I guess xD), I'm strugling trying to find a Human class to play with her, still deciding between warrior or paladin, which one would be better for leveling with her (also she gonna play in a PVE server), or any other ally class suggestion for me?
---
CEO/President of blizzard - what's the difference? I never said he was the CEO of Activision blizzard.
---
And I obviously meant to type 180 dollars a year, not month, was that too tough for you to work out?
---
If you work FIFO you can be working 12 hour days for weeks with no days off. You will, however be rich.
---
It was something about putting together modern engine with the old data (including data structure), which none of the priv servers does. Pservers run the old engine (as far as I know). I'm sure someone can elaborate much more.
---
There’s already plenty of guides out there and other add ons for it. Wouldn’t shock me if it’s going to be made for this.
---
I don't know.... Sounds like the new gods... Heretic.
---
Random comment but I always loved that bar setup for pet classes
---
You right - Murlocs &gt; the world
---
Windfury tho
---
vanilla today is very different from vanilla 13 years ago
---
Hahah I never noticed that. Must have been foreshadowing for the shit show BfA was going to be :')
---
I remember the first time I got to the top of IF.
---
I then spent 3 days doing nothing but showing my guildies how to get up there.
---
Was never banned for doing it though.
---
Imagine Reddit, in which you ask a question, you get 1 reply with the answer and it's done.
---
"Invite me to the pentagram layer"
---
Hate to see that.
---
I get what your saying and I’ve heard some players on the Countdown to Classic Podcast saying they will have multiple lv60 chars so it must be achievable.
---
Roll an alt with him for sure. Don't send money from your main to it, either.
---
The real answer was what was your time played.
---
What pet are you gonna go with?
---
😂
---
Imba
---
Sounds like your own bias, since you’re comparing two very different scenarios. If you want to bitch about racials, great, we can talk about how it took until wrath to add one decent racial to alliance, while Horde have had WOTF, orc stun resist, war stomp, arcane torrent for how long?... hell berserking was way better than what ally got before they normalized all the damage racials... EMFH was one racial, and blizzard only nerfed It in legion because people were finally starting to switch over to alliance for it
---
But the whole war mode bonus is a different thing altogether. They added the bonus because no one on alliance wants to pvp. Why does no one on alliance want to pvp? It couldn’t be because of years of blizzard systemically pushing horde as the pvp dominant faction? Nah, it must be whatever preconceived biases I have about what kind of players play alliance...
---
Escape artist is top teir easy.
---
I believe Omar did the Proof of concept that got the implementation of classic started in earnest.
---
It's a feat well deserving of praise.
---
These changes are nothing like Cata. They’re removals of tedious and rarely used skills to open for new and fun things. 
---
Nobody wants nor do they need enmity combos. Wasted space. If you used them more than 1-2 times on pull you were wrong and should feel wrong. 
---
Mch needed a full rework. Summoner actually looks like a summoner, finally. 
---
Sure, the removal of the damage type debuffs is a little unexpected, but most people didn’t optimally use them nor did they really care. If anything it was an unnecessary limit on high end group comp. 
---
More open compositions? Yes please. Cleaner rotations that don’t really lose much? Yeah alright cool. Less focus on specific class synergy? Awesome. It’s more inclusive and that should feel good, but you, like many seem to get your bits in a tangle when other people are allowed to more consistently apply themselves to a higher endgame experience and don’t feel shoved outta parties because they decided they wanted to play the short robot guy instead of the puncha stompy guy.  
---
You lost nothing, the changes are awesome. This is almost as useful as the people who can’t get over the fact that there viera and hrothgar are genderlocked.
---
Maybe don’t shun a wildly popular game that I assume you liked before the changes are even in your hands. Same thing happened before stormblood and I think it did really well too once people had the buttons there to use.
---
Yes, good ideas. :) As long as it's in the open world of course
---
Will you people ever realize how absurd that argument is?
---
Technical changes != Content Changes.
---
Have fun sitting in a queue for a few days then, mate. It's more than a few hours of madness.
---
When I first started playing WOW I rolled a UD lock, when I got to UC I hated so much I rerolled Alliance.
---
The horde locations with the exception of Mulgore are far too dank, run down and depressing.
---
&gt; Arena was great compared to Vanilla PvP i.e. the honor system grind/mafia.
---
Arena is a whole different aspect of the PvP game, it doesn't have to be compared to honor system. Vanilla had just honor. BC added the arena. I agree that arena was a great addition but you can't argue it didn't change the game significantly. It made the game infinitely more competitive based and started the whole esports in WoW thing. Personally I loved arena but I can see why other people hated it, because it changed the game so much.
---
&gt; The gameplay generally was more balanced as well
---
Balance doesn't automatically equal better. Retail WoW is very balanced, every spec can do everything the other specs do. This balancing destroyed class uniqueness and fantasy, now everyone is the same. Speaking about balancing in BC, it wasn't really well balanced. As mentioned by another poster, warlocks were ridiculous, together with warriors and druids. 
---
&gt; Daily quests were a vast improvement on repetitively killing mobs for rep.
---
Daily quests were just as repetitive. It wasn't a "vast improvement". Even more, a lot of people hated daily quests which forced Blizzard to abandon the system.
---
&gt; Achievements were completely groundbreaking and now adopted by every game ever.
---
Achievements were useless, they still are. It's literally a shiny animation taking half of your screen to announce you have completed something. It's one of the most useless systems introduced into video games. They weren't groundbreaking either. Achievements were used in many other games when WoW added them in WotLK pre-patch (not really BC).
---
&gt; These were released in vanilla with epic BG rep rewards, the tier 0.5 set, ZG/AQ in general etc
---
Not comparable to getting epics just by running dungeons in BC.
---
I'm not sure 1 second extra makes much diff in PvE, I've always seen Imp Bash as a PvP talent.
---
I’m playing Beta and it’s been heaven. Seriously. You’ll be so happy.
---
&gt;What we all want
---
Unless you are so far gone that you are using the _"Pluralis Maiestatis"_, no, we do not "all want" that.
---
If indeed you are using the royal we, then I am deeply sorry, your highness, please excuse a lowly peasant while you go back rearranging your wig-collection.
---
And the first 4 months or so of BFA the pvp bonus was free real estate for the horde.
---
Besides yesterday GMs spawned bolivar foredragon in undercity for people to defeat. When they did they got about 2g each as loot.
---
I first heard of WoW when my boarding school was visiting our sister school and my best friend started talking about it with my then girlfriend who attended the sister school. She was excited about the prospect of riding a nightsaber while my buddy was more of a kodo man, and I had no goddamn clue what they were talking about. I didn't get into WoW myself until early 2006, and initially I just thought of it as a way to stay in touch with my friend after we both finished school.  
---
Now I'm just another addict just like you people :p
---
Awesome thanks for the info, sounds like 3440x1440 should be smooth enough with a good rig based on that.
---
Yeah, these little interactions is a reason for many people to play classic
---
The more I think about it the more I think that comment was bait. He wanted to cause outrage and see where people stood. WhAt he he did there was some 4d chess. As a business man and father when I tell my kids and customers they don’t want something to make them want it more. It’s buisness and parenthood. 101
---
I'm so glad I'm not the only one. What I'm looking for in the whole classic experience for me is the exact opposite of rushing to the end game as fast as possible.
---
Hi, /u/Ziino_
---
y so salty tho?
---
But doesn't #nochanges mean no changes, doesn't specify
---
Sharding and layering effectively accomplish the same goal, which is to allow a significant portion of the playerbase to actually access the game upon launch. You said you would quit WoW if sharding remained a thing, but you're cool with layering, which splits up a realm just as much as sharding except more rigidly?
---
I’m torn between Paladin and Priest. 
---
I think Paladin will be difficult to heal 5-mans leveling up as Ret, but will be great at end game PVP and PVE, and those tier sets. 
---
Priest, I don’t like not having/affording a wand until Cookie in DM. I’m not keen on shadow at all. I think end game PVE may be more rewarding than Paly but PVP healing, I’ll be too squishy.
---
Just your neighborhood friendly Druid
---
Get that wand asap!
---
Priest is one of the best levelers there is. Basicly open with one dmg spell, dot and wand the rest of the fight. Never oom. Fast kills. Good survivability. 
---
Just make sure to have good wand all the time.
---
&gt;Bugs arent "authentic".
---
It depends on the bug.
---
Some bugs can be described as unintentional features because they add something interesting to the game. 
---
Bugs that break a competitive game should be removed, but some like the Civilization Gandhi Peace rating overflow bug are part of gaming history.
---
A bit of extra copper and peacebloom will "fuck up the economy". It might temporary drive down the price of copper and peacebloom on the AH during a time when no one will be buying anything anyway, but that's probably about it.
---
And I, as a priest without shoulders, almost had to threaten to hs out because so many groups wanted to skip that boss.
---
or an Aimed shot + concussive shot
---
or an frost trap, so it frosts an area for 1min .
---
If not in the open world (eg in city), only that Bouquet of Roses off-hand to buff people comes to my mind... but not obtainable until some event..
---
Well, with creativity there are some options indeed\^\^
---
&gt;Theres been many times actually where reddit has gotten upset because of loot boxes.
---
Reddit is like a tiny fraction of the gaming community, and a relatively hardcore one at that. Like 90% (entirely pulled out of my ass) of gamers diddle their games for an hour a day and don't bother to go to forums discussing them. Check out the leagueoflegends blogs for this. If you read the sub you'd think it's fairly clear that everyone in this game is a Diamond+ ranked player that all want the same kinda stuff for the game. RIOT has again and again stressed that reddit is just a tiny fraction of the community and not at all representative for the community at large. They have surveys that reach the people who don't visit reddit regularly and it's pretty clear that the people who bother to come to a gaming community forum are not the average gamer. 
---
As for loot boxes, look at CS:GO's history. Just do. The game released, nobody played it, they released lootboxes and now it's a very successful game. I don't get it. I posted about this a couple days ago how I just don't get how cosmetics can make or break a game. Either I enjoy the gameplay or I don't. The idea that gambling for skins draws players in who don't enjoy the gameplay enough to play the game regardless is absolutely ridiculous to me! But it's happening. **Evidently**.
---
The best gauge on classic's success we have is private servers. The community is not tiny by any margin, there will be plenty people enjoying classic for sure. I have no doubt that it will NOT fail. And there will be more players than pservers for several reasons. I for one played on some, I never engaged too much, though, because I always feared the risk of losing all progress when Blizzard shuts em down. Others will have had a problem with the legal aspect, some likely thought they could get banned on battle.net for playing on pservers. So the amount of interested players is open ended. We don't know.
---
**I got that you just said you didn't mean to claim you know.**  That's all I want to say after all. "We cannot know for sure". 
---
But I'll ramble on a little longer: Gaming culture certainly has changed. Not for you or me (how we view our hobby). I still like what I liked back then. I fucking love Dark Souls for bringing back difficulty into gaming and it's success shows that difficult games are not dead.
---
But you gotta acknowledge there are market researchers at Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo and other huge studios that have decided the most money is in what basically amounts to gambling and/or interactive movies (press X to pray) and microtransactions. Look at the Sekiro sub and the whole "Sekiro should have an easy mode" discussion. The majority of modern gamers are not (gatekeeping) true gamers in the sense that the people who founded this hobby were. They want a little interactivity with their story but might as well watch a movie. They don't wanna grind 24 hours on end (except some asian cultures who love grinding apparently). Again: I'm not saying I know anything about how successful classic will be, merely that these things are indicators that it MIGHT not become quite as popular as it'd need to be to overshadow retail. 
---
It might though. And I do hope so. For what it's worth...
---
From what I've seen, they do not aggro for a while, but I don't know about the moving thing though.
---
Lol your dumb gods words don’t 1 hit u . Grand exchange really helped no 1 even liked pre none ge it was a pain in the ass
---
No professions are mandatory for anyone in PvE.  Just have your consumables ready when you raid.  
---
Engineering is generally a pvp profession for most classes (For some it's strong in pve, like Warriors, for Force Reactive Disk).  
---
Herb is another good choice for rogue because you can farm your own swifthistle and fadeleaf for thistle tea and blinding powder.
---
Hi, /u/Ilizur, your post has been removed as it is seems to be talking about the current stress test. Please use the current [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bui555/stress_test_2_the_megathread_of_omg_why_can_i_not/) instead.
---
It's not bad, just make sure your first 10 points go into Wand Specialization and Spirit Tap
---
As a priest, I basically lived in SM for a long time to earn the gold for my lvl 40 mount. Even though the travelling to that instance was a long one for alliance.
---
maybe take a walk around once and realize how it is a very logical layout
---
Was my all time favourite part of any classic dungeon
---
while i support the #nochange ideal if you stick to it well past everyone is clearing naxx it will just kill  the classic server, whats left to do once you have cleared naxx and have full bis kit? mop up the remaining quests, then what?
---
change will have to happen at some point, i don't want it until the server is becoming stagnant but i feel change will have to happen at some point
---
Sounds good dude!
---
Fuck Horde cities tbh :') had to play Horde cause of friends in retail, and I'm just so glad to be back in IF, SW and Darnassus... The music, the ambient, the smoky dwarf district of SW, the green park, love everything there.
---
Why is Horde more popular all of a sudden? In original vanilla I played Horde and we were outnumbered serverly. Now I play Alliance on a pserver and we are outnumbered once again.
---
You’re just adding the expansions now with no levelling. This would be terrible imho
---
So many people standing in line for a ticket to the closed beta :o
---
Lower karazan
---
Levelling is already a joke? There's nothing particularly difficult about it, if you've done it before it's not like it does anything other than let you just watch TV shows or whatever at the same time so you don't have to focus on which quest you're on.
---
That goes for Vanilla as much as it does live.
---
Struggling to see why esfand and asmongold are getting credit for things which the entire rest of the community there are actually doing instead
---
You can skip tailoring and get someone to craft you Robe of Winter Nights which is as good as Robes of the Void. You'll save time and gold!
---
In PVE: not too bad, you don't deal tons of damage for a long while but that's not your job anyways. 
---
In PVP: never really had any major issues, shadowburn, dots, death coil, soulshard, healthstones and voidwalker sacrifice keeps you pretty damn safe.
---
Always take enrage here. The issue with tanking in vanilla is always getting threat fast, enrage lets you do that. You will use imp. enrage a lot. The on demand threat is much better than some damage slowly being added on.
---
Umm alliance is literally last in everything
---
Just put in paid character boosts
---
So one person exploiting is what Warsong has turned into now?
---
Don't forget: ulduar, caverns of time, hyjal, gilneas, quel-thalas. All exists in vanilla
---
I will get my wife to start the adventure together with me.  
---
She only played Stardew valley with me yet. But I see great potential in her.
---
Yet horde has always been the best players....with the highest ratings and first boss kills
---
That shot is AWESOME
---
Uhm, that was over ten years ago. I don’t even remember what I ate last week...
---
I like travling as an alliance too much to go horde. But I always had a toon each in TB, UC, and Thousand Needles to enjoy the surroundings.
---
Spirit Tap + Improved Wands makes it a really efficient leveler. Goal is to front load your casts and wand to kill the mob so your mana is regening when spirit tap procs. Something like Mind Blast -&gt; Smite -&gt; SW: P -&gt; Wand till dead is a solid rotation. Will have virtually no downtime.
---
No movement speed abilities though, which makes long travel a chore. Also need to keep finding better wands as you level as that improves your leveling speed a lot.
---
Cant see why discussing changes of classic wow does not fit into this sub. Maybe nochangers should start another subreddit called pserverwow. 5% parry btw.
---
"No1 even liked pre-ge it was a pain in the ass"
---
Is that what they're gonna say when they add looking for group to classic?
---
I mean, if WoW lore was any more fleshed out in the cultural department for each race then these places would have actual Dwarvish language name, like Teldrassil and Darnassus. Those aren't, after all, Big Tree and Tree City after all.
---
I firmly believe that these Dwarven places are simply idiotic human/common language translations and that their actual names for Ironforge and Blackrock Mountain can't be PROPERLY translated, because of cultural aspects.
---
Like the Dwarvish name for Ironforge not just being a compound word of two smithing-related terms, but in Dwarvish it'd also translate to a cozy home, a rich underground lair full of minerals, an impenetrable fortress being full of resources and military might and an ancient, honourable place of dwarven history.
---
Same with Blackrock also entailing a sense of dread and danger, a foreboding place of terror but also a place of familiarity since the Blackrock wasn't always THIS violent of an area, but only after Thaurissan called forth Ragnaros.
---
But all of those additional meanings are lost in translation, because nobody wants to write "Comely and Warm Forge of Iron That Created A Bond Between Dwarven Brothers And Sisters For Thousands of Years Which Hasn't Ever Been Occupied By Any Foreign Forces And Which Harbours Great Secrets And Treasures As Well As Hospitality And History Deep Within" on a map. Hence just "Ironforge" and thousands of dwarves groaning out in pain, rolling their eyes and cursing those humies for butchering their language.
---
you have varying degrees of #nochange, you have the one that feel blizz should have got old blade servers installed on them and had a 100% carbon copy of 1.12, you then have the ones that understand that technical changes are for the better as long as the content is the same, who wants to hold shift every time the loot just to make sure they loot all when blizz can add the option to always auto loot unless you hold shift?
---
then i think you have a few of us that want the server to run its course as a 1.13 server with only the technical changes and then when it starts to stagnate then we should look at adding new things that were cut for the sake of expansions and seeing what vanilla could have been after naxx
---
as far as farming im expecting hunter &gt; mage.
---
p1 hunter has mara, mage has brd (minus arena) or mara aka budget hunter (hunter wins)
---
p2 hunter has trib runs, mage has dm:east/north (hunter wins)
---
p3 mage has AV lotus.
---
p4 mage has ZG. (comparable to trib for a few weeks then it drops off)
---
obviously some stuff can change like if there's black lotus in dire maul, but overall how can you beat trib runs on a hunter. give mages BRD arena is the only way and it doesn't look like that's happening.
---
endgame I mean generally it looks like there's gonna be less warriors than demand, private servers have a larger percentage of warrior players compared to the classic sensus. fury warriors may get threat capped harder than on private though. mage raiding is a friggin snoozefest (im a mage main) and certainly on private the damage isn't great until AQ/Naxx. I only play it because aoe leveling (I hate leveling) and for pvp. I would plan for MC/BWL phase that other stuff is too far into the future, realistically a ton of players will quit by p5/6. 
---
druid isn't very appealing to me simply because wpvp ranking is coming out before warsong. and druid is one of the least appealing pve classes, it's redeeming trait is you can raid once a month and still be geared to the teeth.
---
priest dm farm will work just fine with herb preferably.
---
maybe start on a hunter and do warrior after
---
Yup ok got it. Yeah it does feel that way
---
meh, ally  standard fantasy cookie cutter shit
---
And that's since been taken out, we're yet another faceroll spec that requires zero thought. It's really sad.
---
Bag swapping completely destroyed the classic experience btw. Inventory management is such a huge part of mmorpg games. Back to my private server /s
---
found myself on the stress test opening my map only to remember the only thing that is good for is seeing where you are since there is no quest info on it at all, i like that feeling makes you read the quests and work for max level, while i don't condemn people for using questing addons i will not be using them
---
No new capital cities...see old school RuneScape as an example. They've added many new zones but by far the most populated areas are some of the first cities you come across in the game
---
ahh I missed what you were saying too and then I got it lol
---
&gt;And this seems to be the opinion of most of the people playing the beta
---
Oh boy. Where did you find that data? Like this is such a flawed logic. You read some posts on reddit and think that's representative? Come on man. I don't even wanna argue this because I love classic and I hope it becomes successful but your argument is so absolutely unscientific, anecdotal and straight out lying.
---
Who are these "most of the people playing beta"? How many are there even? How many have not even made use of their beta invite? 
---
Also considering you had to actively sign up for being considered for beta that already heavily corrupts the data through a non neutral process of selecting the test subjects.
---
The reddit threads you see are not representative for "most people playing on beta", which is something you understand once you learn that the vast majority of gamers don't visit forums to discuss their games (and even less visit reddit specifically, but instead other forums). Going to a place for hardcore fans to discuss a game and using the posts there to gauge overall happiness is just entirely meaningless.
---
The biggest plus for classic I see right now is streamers gushing over how good it is. That might influence people to try/like it who otherwise wouldn't. 
---
I hope it blows up (success I mean) and there is totally a chance. But we cannot tell right now. Not at all. We don't have the data to make any educated guess. (if you do, please share)
---
/bow
---
might also have something to do with how they made it so retail and classic won't be two separate clients, but rather share a lot of resources (just guessing though)
---
Thats amazing for a casual player
---
I honestly don´t quite get the downvotes. 
---
I think downvotes should be saved for bad comments inside a discussion - not to avoid a discussion Overall.
---
But I guess most People in this Sub are quite drained out of discussions about changes - this has been Happening in here for 1-2 years now. So the best Thing is to just don´t say anything about changes :)
---
If you do wish to, I guess you just have to live with the downvotes atm :3
---
Nah, it's so good. It's such a great and smooth process while leveling. It's not as fast as some other classes but it's smooth.
---
Look up Kargoz's Priest leveling guide on YouTube.
---
5% boss parry for the real vannila experience in private server lul.
---
No it is mandatory. Sappers are way too good.
---
In terms of efficiency? Almost definitely not. But it’s a gorgeous zone and usually very quiet since everyone else is off in Darkshore or Westfall. I love Dun Morogh, if you haven’t done it before definitely make time.
---
I doubt Blizzard would do it, but it'd be fantastic to see some of the future expansion content within Classic's framework. Wrath would be a much better experience imo with a fixed raid difficulty and size, no welfare badge gear, no 3.2 creating the play the patch philosophy, and no LFG. I don't see it ever happening as it's a ton of work, and Wrath is still a really popular expansion, so they'd probably go with the no changes philosophy still, but for me personally it's the first expansion that I think would very clearly benefit from a change in philosophy.
---
I don't know if you're asking to play a DPS and tank hybrid and if that's the case, Druid is your option. I think Rogue would work decently well with Warrior because if the Warrior has the threat and a Rogue can safely backstab and ambush mobs consistently you will kill mobs very easily.
---
I quit wow a long time ago. Can you/any give me a tl;dr/eli5 on what "sharding" is? I know "phasing" they introduced in wotlk.
---
Tuesday is the 27th, not Monday.
---
Looking for group is different on RuneScape you actual have to make your way to Raids also you just can’t  que but you can teleport to the Raid and get there easy I don’t know much about classic so I don’t know how hard it is to get to raid and dungeon areas
---
Omar is a false god. Would a god just leave his people to waste away in loneliness? We need to find the true God; a just god. One who does not favor the alliance but all the children of Azeroth.
---
Consider guardian spirit (which, at least on live, is essentially an extremely large absorb) going on cooldown and the target still dying. Damage would seemingly happen first.
---
It's projecting
---
I didnt flaunt money I flaunted an astronomical return rate on investing in video game companies. Investors are compensated by the free market for properly evaluating products and companies. My results speak for themselves. Also Ive spent the last week in the jungles of south Palawan where people make 4 dollars a day and live in extreme poverty, I have a very well rounded world view from my traveling. Im not arrogant im a realistic person
---
That Looks awesome! Thanks for sharing :)
---
It really has a great “you’re going on a grand adventure!” vibe and I love ZF for that.
---
I thought the 8% dodge rate was the same? 14% parry rate would only effect you if you can't get behind the boss which against most raid bosses will not be the case.
---
I dare you telling melee group theyre not getting WF totem
---
Raided in Vanilla, cleared naxx til sapph. Fucking world of waitcraft, wait call, door, disconnect, cat, dog, toilet * 40.
---
No problem :D
---
And it launches the 26th for NA, 3pm pst
---
Oh yes. I was playing Druid and I had to stop just before the Bear form last quest!!! /cry
---
I feel you man... I feel you. Next time...
---
I think Jagex nailed it and could be used as an example for Blizzard. They've added entire new zones into OSRS yet players spend most of their time in original areas.
---
I love ZF too! When I first played wow as a 10 year old I got stuck in Tanaris(i didnt know about addons and couldnt figure out quests). 
---
so I grinded Basilisks, and ZF to lvl haha. It took me so long that I had random players giving me advice to help out.
---
I never had a problem not bringing engineering in pve, and I raided semi-hardcore on the servers-that-shall-not-be-discussed (also as a "medium tier" raider when Vanilla was live). As far as I know, Engineering does offer a slight boost to dps, but it requires a, to me, insane level of commitment and time spent in the game - because you'll want raid consumables (pots and food) in any case, and that means either paying through the nose in the AH, paying a bit less to get it from a guildie, or having an alt that supports you. This doesn't get talked about a lot, but all those gold sellers? You know who very good customers of them are? The people who need that gold to raid.
---
I usually go for Alch/Herb on my Rogue when starting - annihilates the whole "where do I get my pots/elixirs from" problem, and since flasks and some recipes aren't exactly practical for an alt to do (you need to be in a lab to make flasks, which means running Scholo to Ras, and you need to be able to see the ghosts there to get the recipe for the Major Mana Pot, to just name two issues you'll run into if you "alt" your alchemy). Plus, you can supply yourself with Fadeleaf, which you need to make Vanishing Powder, and with Swiftthistle, which you need for your Thistle Tea.
---
Of course, as time marches on and you have free time away from your main's progress, you can do a farming alt with Mining/Herb, and go Engi/Alch on your main - *if* you have that time to spare, and are willing to put in the effort. But, again, I have yet to be even taken aside and have my professions discussed with raiders, because outside of the very "elite", it just doesn't matter that much - it's hard enough to find enough dedicated and dependable people in the required raid composition to have the luxury of sieving them out by their maybe-not-optimal professions. As said, my raid in actual Vanilla was in the middle bracket in terms of seriousness - we would absolutely buff us up before hard encounters, and you got a talking to if your rogue did not have at least an Agi pot up at all times - but we managed to say Hi to C'Thun (no kill during Vanilla, though) without our professions being scrutinized at all. 
---
So if you have the discussion about optimal professions, you're already raiding Naxx, and at that point, it *may* become valid. But certainly not before.
---
Would be nice if you changed minimap to always show north at the top so it's easier to see where you are going. Thanks anyway.
---
Hmmm... I never really tanked tbh :P But when I researched warrior tanking a bit I was really surprised to find out that Battle Shout is one of the stronger (in some cases the strongest) threat Generator when tanking multiple Mobs.
---
Depending on how many Group members are in the range of battleshout. If there isn´t any Group member around demoralizing shout is the stronger threat Generator.
---
I never knew that and it blew my mind :P A buff for AOE tanking :D
---
Alliance tanking is a lot easier than Horde tanking.
---
Once I get 60 I'm going to start on my alt.
---
I plan on maintaining a Tank, Healer and DPS at the highest level in all aspects. Otherwise the game gets stale for me.
---
Well then, I think that Tauren is no go for me then
---
skinning LW is nice for levelling and if you go dragonscale LW you can be useful to the guild with things like the ony cloak that is used for BWL.
---
Engineering is nice as if you go goblin you get the bombs which can be a small dps increase if you work them into rotations.
---
alchemy is nice for potions and at ma level you can make flasks if you farm the patterns and don't mind running scholomance to make them.
---
enchanting can be nice for everyone because enchants
---
tailoring as a rogue isn't great but bags never hurt
---
blacksmithing  if you go weapon smith can make some nice items but normally raid drops will be better
---
ultimately it is down to what you want to do with it.
---
as a side note gathering skills can be nice money makers as always
---
Reminds me of those retarded edgy kids who try to draw a pentagram at the back of the bus seats but somehow manage to screw it up.
---
If you want some really good Info on tanking on classic private Server at least (it may differ from classic wow) I can really recommend Skarm on YouTube.
---
He has excellent Prot Warrior, Fury Warrior and Feral Druid tanking Videos!
---
Same in Mulgore.
---
Btw. I found out also one mob which was "grey" meaning it was "tagged" by a player, but no one was fighting it. Looked like it did not reset after evede,
---
He walked into the event slightly after the letters were formed. He did not organise it but he did bring more attention to it ;P
---
I was really worried about quest helpers not being in the game at launch as I've been playing with them on pservers. I got into the stress test and it's actually not hard finding quests if you look thoroughly. It makes me feel more immersed and even better - I remember all the quests and where to go and I remember locations and the towns and everything.
---
With a quest helper I was zipping through towns, not reading quests, etc. It felt more like a chore to get to 60.
---
Now without ques helpers, it's so much nicer and overall better. After the stress test ended, I straight up removed any quest addons.
---
But the chance to hit (white resist) and shadow resistance on mobs (yellow resist) are two different things, though. Shadow focus does nothing against shadow resistance, so more than 3/5 is essentially a waste if your aim is to level efficiently, as in not continously grinding mobs 3 lvls higher than you. 
---
Or do I misunderstand you somehow?
---
Can't be certain, was not playing on live and made many hunters, But it is at least 15 days played, I leveled above 20 at least 10 times  and above 40 at least 3 times and once to 55.   
---
Best time from 1 - 6 was roughly 30 min  
---
from 1-25 was about 1 day
---
and I think level 44 is roughly halfway and I got that in a about 2½ days, but I was not speed leveling. Just catching up to the new part of the guide, having to take pictures at times and explore maps fully.
---
"me edgy, me warlord, FoR tEh HoRdE" idk man, to each his own, but I'm sick of the sound of drums and bulky characters...
---
Omar did it! In a cave! With a box of scraps!
---
Holy priest with chanting and tailoring. Need that wand ASAP yo
---
Sine my release will be a LAN with 3 friends im the healing pally with Enchanting and Tailoring.
---
With the main focus on Tailoring for the early bags, we also want to do a lot of dungeons so the extra cloth comes in handy
---
I'm thinking druid with herbalism and alchemy, as main proffs and I'm also thinking cooking and fishing would be fun to try again. I remember the food buffs being real good, and fishing is perfect for those nights where you are to tired to raid and just wanna chill with a joint lol.
---
Hi, /u/jebeli13
---
Just gotta wait until 8/26 if you are NA :)
---
I think there’ll be tons of warriors around not wanting to tank, so I don’t think people will expect you to, unless your friends maybe, it you’re rolling together.
---
It may be an exaggeration, but I don't think that's an issue. Behaving and talking in ways that kills civility is toxic to discussion.
---
&gt; I'd call anyone that uses the word toxic toxic by their own definition, for reducing conversation to name calling.
---
There's a point in a real life conversation where you stop letting someone be rude, and while it might kill that conversation, at a certain point you have to stand up to stop every conversation from being unpleasant. I don't think it's blanket wrong to call someone out for being rude.
---
&gt; But that's exactly my point, how is you giving me a Google link "toxic"?
---
Because I meant it to be rude or condescending. Not all toxicity is objective, but I definitely think there is objective toxicity, specifically when someone is intending to be a dick.
---
Yes I mean for example you start to cast a 2.5s heal that more or less you know how much hp it will heal when it lands, and if you think the heal will overheal the tank because he still has enough hp, you move a step to cancel the cast and start again.
---
So you don't waste a heal, also you stay more time without casting and out of the 5s rule to keep mana regen, so it's a win/win. 
---
Just be careful at the begining until you get comfortable with it (it can be embarassing if your tank dies having your mana bar full, you have to be confident about how much your heals heal).
---
You know what I love about these pictures?  The "Bug report" button next to a huge fuckin spider.
---
I got Rank2 with like 90 Kills on the Beta. How can anyone have 1500kills at Level10 :D
---
Also normal for hospital workers. You get used to it surprisingly quickly.
---
probably?
---
Learn to pool your rage at the end of pulls. Starting a pull with 0 rage is really annoying. Also, Tactical Mastery is going to make you feel better about it because you have to Thunderclap in Battle Stance.
---
night elf druid or troll shaman?
---
Bis for a long time is the tailor only chest: true faith vestments. You need tailoring to craft it as its bop but I’m not sure if you need to remain a tailor to keep wearing it after crafting? Anyone confirm?
---
Mod Ash is super charismatic and endearing along with being the absolute backbone of OSRS. 
---
I've only seen Omar pop as a GM (and obviously the results of the work he's done) but not really say much. I hope he can rise to the limelight.
---
He's essentially Oldschool Runescape's Mod Ash of Classic WoW.
---
spriest, feral druid is viable.
---
its really just shamans, ret, and boomy than aren't viable.
---
and late game ele and boomy are kinda viable. ele because he gets -res gear and same for boomy + mages are popping
---
Is there a hidden multiplier for threat with maul or divisor on thorns? It was my understanding that threat from damage was treated the same regardless of source.
---
I can see value in opening the fight with more rage, but you'd effectively just be dumping the extra into swipe since maul is locked to auto attacks and you can open with a maul without imp enrage. Swipe being 15 rage means you get 2 extra swipes every 3 mins which works out to  0.79 DPS using my above values. However, that value is front loaded on use and it would take \~16 attacks on you before the Thorns would out produce it.
---
Oh, too bad. Thanks anyway :)
---
I did not spawn there, I fell as a ghost
---
They've removed wall jumping, so scaling invisible walls wouldn't work anymore.
---
Naga-na-gonna work here anymore
---
Dude I entirely misread your post at first, wrote a reply to that and feel stupid now. 
---
I agree. If Legion had had a higher difficulty in the world, it'd have been the best addon. I'd still want for them to remove flying (which was disabled for a long time to be fair) and all the LFD/LFR crap (which is entirely anti social)
---
But yea, the provided content was plentiful and pretty good. The raids were nice, Mythic+ is the best thing that happened to dungeons since TBC, zone scaling is actually something I like (keeps content somewhat relevant for longer). Legion did so much right. I just cannot grasp how they could fuck up BfA so ridiculously hard gameplay wise.
---
Is this night from the beta or the old classic version ? If it is from the beta, can you make a screenshot at the darkest night in duskwood ?
---
I hated it more for lore/immersion reasons, not so much because of the dislike for catch-up systems that a lot of people have. It just didn't make any sense.
---
If you replaced the vendor with a questgiver offering the exact same gear, and given some narrative context/justification for the system (rare materials used to craft special arms and armour) I'd have probably been okay with it. But setting it up as a vendor just felt... wrong.
---
I wonder if worked.
---
FeelsGoodMan

God Ash*
---
If you aren't gonna play the exact times everyday or wait to level and stay even no need to. Just play and help
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Heard a news story where a political lobbyist in real life was perma banned in game for fraud and insider trading as he held some in game, elected position.
---
And it was FALSE, then they reverted it, but it was too late, he quit anyway.
---
I think that is understood :) The PvP rank needed is 11, you get a discount for all mounts at rank 3 though. The point is, skeleton horses and normal raptors are too fragile to support a Tauren's weight, so they cannot ride these.
---
I want to have good chances in pvp against the popular 3 (warr/mage/rogues) and not have to respec ever week for the privilege.
---
Seriously though. Vanilla wow game design with Wrath of the Lich King class design (everything viable) would be amazing.
---
&gt;  People on reddit think they're the hot shit and that they're the core audience in every game and they're not
---
IF reddit was nothing EA wouldnt spend so much astroturfing it now. 
---
P.S. Battlefail II sold only 66% what its predecessor did. So you EA apologists can suck on one.
---
Its mandatory if you want to compete with ither rogues that have engineering so yes, for me it would be mandatory and hardcore and even some semi hardcore guilds might require you to have it.
---
&gt; a friend knows someone that brought one for about 5 different character as he "couldn't be bothered to level them" 
---
its almost like they MAKE LEVELING SUCK on purpose now
---
*fuck modern blizz*
---
deadmines had 100k.
---
i GUARANTEE vanilla will see at LEAST 1m-2m over its lifetime.  if we can tap into all the old fans... anywhere from 2m to 4m... or more if BFA dies sooner.
---
But why would you try to be exalted with them?
---
If you say mount, it's impossible for Night Elves to ride them.
---
If you're going to do this I'd recommend at least playing your warrior on rested XP as you level, rather than waste the weeks of double XP you'd accumulate on your warrior. A Paladin is a ~~horrible~~ unusual class for a farmer though, is your heart set on the class or would you consider a better farming (and levelling) class like hunter/mage/rogue?
---
Holy is superstrong pre 40.
---
I rerolled priest after the talent revamp in vanilla, and liked my holy fire so much, I lvld all the way to 60 as holy/disc with spirit tap, imp. sw. pain, and 3/5 shadow focus. Shadow is faster after lvl 40/44, but my god, healing is so much more chill with some holy talents.
---
Did baron under 45 min for the t0,5 for a guildie at lvl 59, albeit the rest of my group had about preraid BIS at the time, and maybe some ZG stuff (we all rerolled, and I was late to the party).
---
Will do it again this time around. It's not that much slower, and I'm gonna lvl grandpa style anyway. Except in dungeons - don't need no conjured water as holy/disc, lol. Gogogo!
---
Only people who tanked in Vanilla can tank in Vanilla. How people who tanked in Vanilla was able to tank in Vanilla is a mystery though because before they tanked in Vanilla they had not tanked in Vanilla and only people who tanked in Vanilla can tank in Vanilla.
---
Is there a TLDW?
---
I can't look at the math right now as I'm one my phone, but I believe that mail has a multiplier, not sure though.
---
But you want the up front threat always because that's when someone else is likely to pull threat. You can get an extra mail later, even if it's not what first hit.
---
I get a bit more hyped everyday just by watching the beta man, I feel you. :)
---
I'd take whatever he says with a big grain of salt.      
---
He got booted out of his own company for making questionable decisions for his game.
---
&gt; . I'm getting to experience a game that Blizzard said they would never, ever, re-release. Period. End of story.
---
Exactly this.  All the people 'muh reddit is nothing' convenient ignore that battlefail2 only sold 2/3rds as many as the first one did.  Reddit had a BIG impact on that.  Dont let the ea shills tell you elsewise.
---
That was my favorite screenshot \^\^
---
I would! But sadly i’m not part of the normal beta, I was only part of the stress test beta and they already closed the servers for now but I think they’ll be doing another stress test in late next month
---
haha :D
---
&gt;  pc gaming is probably a 
---
there will always be a market.... Vinyl still exists.
---
Cause I wanted some downvotes this mornin.
---
Down-ranking is only really efficient when you have +healing gear, which isn't really the case at lower levels. 
---
At lower levels you just have to be efficient with your heals. Don't throw out heals as soon as your tank loses 10% health. Check how much your heals heal for, and wait until your tank is close having lost that amount of health before starting your cast. Like, if your main heal heals for 300 health, wait until the tank is down by 250 or so, and then start your cast. This means you get the most out of your 5 second rule mana regen, because you're not casting spells all the time.
---
Also, learn how to start casts and then cancelling them if the heal isn't needed. That means you always have a heal ready, but then if it isn't needed, you can just cancel it, but if your tank suddenly loses a lot of HP, you're ready.
---
dude seriously...   he said 'we' in his stream ffs
---
Beautiful +1
---
Yeah the closest to a Brevik is path of exile. 
---
Nothing tops Warcraft/Starcraft at their peak. 
---
Same  with Warcraft.  Rfit was *close* though.
---
Thanks ! I really appreciate it. I got home late (Living in EU) and I thought the Stress Test would have been over but luckily I got in and they "started summoning" Omar (lol). Then the rest happened.
---
The stress test was awesome once again. I played the hell out of WSG and I've got a quest log fully stacked with completed quests ready to turn in if they decide to raise the level cap again. If not, then I had a lot of fun but I won't participate as heavily in the next one (except by playing some WSG again I guess), if indeed I even can once my sub runs out. It seems certain no more wave of invites will be going out, so I'm at least glad I got to play *some* Classic after resubbing for the beta. Playing amongst the zerg in the starting zones was especially nice, since it gave me some info on how to refine my leveling route when Classic is released. 
---
Going to be taking a break from all things WoW Classic related now, until the next stress test at least.
---
Been playing the game since 1.0 as well, with SBR they go the same path wow did over the years, simpler and simpler classes, all classes per archetypes do the same things but with different FXs, fewer and fewer rpg elements, etc.
---
They will lose some crowd and gain another, and slowly decay.
---
SBR could well be the woltk of ffxiv, sounds good on paper but in practice in the end , it didn't.
---
We'll see.
---
&gt;  the less demanding role of leading the OW team though.
---
Seriously OW is a really mediocre multiplayer game though.
---
Thanks for the insight here. Did not appreciate the point on alchemy labs at all, assumed that would be straightforward- so very good to know!
---
Playing Vanilla it honestly feels like Blizzard only figured their own Game out in AQ.
---
Suddenly the Items make so much more sense
---
&gt; Sounds like your own bias (...) If you want to bitch
---
Sure, ok. If trying to have a conversation is bitching and you need to start going for personal attacks...
---
&gt; Nah, it must be whatever preconceived biases I have about what kind of players play alliance...
---
Where have I said anything about Alliance players and what "kind" they are?
---
Let's ignore the fact that 80% of top Arena players are on Alliance, even after those nerfs. Let's be emotional instead and pull arguments out of nowhere. People flocked to Horde, not because of PvP but because top guilds learned how to utilize Horde racials to clear PvE content faster. And it should be balanced. But giving blatantly obvious bonuses is not the way to do it. Blizz could have started with for example not giving Zandalari free heal to max if they can avoid dmg for 5 sec. That is bullshit and certainly won't help the faction balance.
---
I'm not even arguing with you that racial are all kinds of messed up since forever, I'm just saying Blizzard is constantly trying to reinvent the wheel instead of tweaking what we have.
---
But if you're going to tell me I'm bitching, and start inventing arguments I've never made, when I'm basically agreeing with you, just criticizing Blizzards approach, let's say you're right. Horde OP, Alliance always pushed down by devs.
---
If OW wasnt a cut up MMO no one would play it.
---
I'm totally on board with you. I like these ideas.
---
$60 online only multiplayer with no campaign or mods.... 
---
1/5 for a *blizzard* game.
---
If you think about it, that has the same amount of "luxury" as a car you just slapped a cupholder on and called it better than it's predecessor.
---
I already have ~140 bag slots and a portable vendor always with me. Spending 15k more on those bags for 6 more slots feels a bit redundant.
---
As a Shaman I can't buff strangers so instead I always drop a searing totem next to anyone fighting a mob, or pop a heal.
---
It ain't much but it's honest work.
---
I was never a fan of OW... IF thats the best he can do, we're better off with new devs today.
---
Are you saying that it’s easier to justify other changes simply because some changes have already been made? If that’s the case then you’ve just proven that the slippery slope is very real.
---
They can just go back to bfa if they wana see hell
---
"everyone works so hard on the hindenberg stop being mean!!!!"

At least in wrath the mammoths were somewhat prestigious, now everybody has them.
---
Nah don't worry, it's helpful, and the video is quality and nail pretty nicely common question about classes.
---
Are you dense? Classic is going to be classic. They have the numbers down to an exact match. I just said with proof pservers are overtuned on purpose. Learn to do some research before whining that your only experience with classic is pservers
---
Tldr?
---
Its in your spellbook. Mouse over the autoattack button.
---
Spirit tap &gt; Imp wand &gt; Imp SWP.
---
Keep up inner fire and PW shield.
---
Mind blast &gt; swp &gt; wand to death.
---
Horizontal Growth would be amazing. Even for Purists
---
I think actually that TBC has a good example of horizontal content, SSC and The Eye are on the same tier of content. Though I suppose those were planned that way from the beginning. 
---
You could perhaps add extra raids at the level of, say, BWL or AQ, then gear from those could also feed into naxx progression.
---
Come on, it's 2 paragraphs.
---
And this is 100% true btw.
---
I know, ridiculous right?
---
I agree with what he was saying... but the moment when he did not help the priest when 2nd mob attacked...
---
It splits up pve and pvp into different gear and categories.
---
Good, you'll be dancing and telling jokes for our amusement when we conquer you.
---
If you're a nitpicking bore whos not out for arguments, and just wants to feel better for himself by "winning" internet arguments, then yeah, that's what it means.
---
Meanwhile, to people for whom rational thought is a part of their life, the realization that the fact that WoW Classic servers won't be 14 year old hardware, and not running 14 year old OS is also a change, but a both neccessry and irrelevant one.
---
One thing that could also be done with new content is to bring more specs up to the point of being more broadly considered as viable with itemization. You could even add additional drops to bosses across the board to keep people interested across all raid tiers. Think stuff like shadow priest gear with mp5 on it and so on. You'd still need something in it for everyone of course but just putting it out there that many specs can be made (more) viable with itemization.
---
I feel like you've posted this in response to something specific, what am I missing here?
---
The initial surge will be way past 2 million.
---
Video not available ?
---
lol comparing the coolest, highest quality mmo ever made to a blimp.
---
For the Lionheart Helm - its a raid recipe. It's in the list.
---
For Black Dragonscale - black dragonscale doesnt have crit on it, and crit is important.
---
For the devilsaur set - I have also listed them, they are just being replaced quickly.
---
So I take it you never visited either Barrens or Goldshire during vanilla?
---
I second this. Fantastic videos.
---
Thank you &lt;3
---
Just keep the level cap at 60 and add horizontal content. That dropped gear equivalent to mc/bwl/aq40/naxx and all that.
---
so sad that we'll never see anotehr blizz pc release again on discs ;(
---
Wow.
---
That was such a fantastic read.
---
Blizzard please we need this man/woman.
---
Will read it in a bit, thank you :)
---
Good post and I think it also highlights this bogus notion that "meme specs" aren't viable and that every raid brings rogues, warriors, locks, mages to DPS and if you're not that then you can go f yourself. 
---
The reality is that even doing hard mode 20/25 mans a lot of guilds were filled with people playing suboptimal specs, people doing way less damage than they should in optimal specs and you highlighted the fact that it's hard to field a 40 man raid at all. If you have some skill and know what you're doing and are prepared there's no reason a "meme spec" cannot be brought to a raid.
---
&lt;3
---
It's pretty easy and smooth leveling as a Priest, but from my own experience it's *the* most boring class to level in vanilla when you're out there solo questing.
---
My friends? Playing wow? With me? Oh thats funny.
---
Not everyone plays WoW staring at the numbers on the screen, its an experience, a journey, half the time you spend in classic WoW, is "useless".
---
But why is that a problem? 
---
The people who just want to PvP don't have to raid for gear and are rewarded with being the strongest in PvP
---
The high end PvE people are still pretty decent against "normal" people or people without the full PvP gear.
---
I dont like him
---
Wait few months until after Classic launches, then compare player numbers for Classic and retail.
---
&gt; most people aren't going to be part of these streamer events with hundreds of people on both sides.
---
Said like someone who has never played vanilla.
---
Yes I don't think resilience was a bad stat. In vanilla there were a lot of people that liked to do PvP and didn't want to do raid PvE, so at some point it felt unfair that somebody that never does PvP could delete you just by the gear he was wearing achieved in raiding PvE.
---
And to get good gear just doing PvP was just an insane amount of time. So for me it was nice that if you would like to do PvP you had to grind this PvP type of gear, and people that played pvp would not feel so bad just being one-shooted by raid geared people. It really felt very imbalanced and was very frustrating tbh.
---
I know a lot of people will say that the ones that got their PvE gear deserves to 1shot plebs in BGs, but i just don't agree. Same goes the other way, PvP gear should be kind of bad to do PvE content, that's why it was pretty bad PvE stat.
---
Just my 2c
---
Yea, but flying mounts remove the encounters completely. It's just 100meters into the air, autopilot on into some direction and afk.
---
Nice, a lot of good answers. Second question: do you go shadow for lvling, if so, how can you heal dungeons? Respeccing is crazy expensive. Do vanilla priests go shadow until 60 and then go heal? Or can you sololvl and go dungeons as holy priest?
---
HEY.  dont speak ill of the bald.  we get enough discrimination when all movie villains are bald guys
---
blizzard is sneaky and this is EXACTLY how they will make it be.
---
I did. A lot of people have been complaining about the streamers' influence on chat, and also the memes that are present today. Including a coworker of mine actually.
---
Also RP. I'm not sure it even exists on the horde side. I mean I know it does in silvermoon, but on classic it should be pretty one sided.
---
Dude he wins either way. Either he was right and can gloat or he's wrong and just made Activision Blizzard a reliable chunk of cash each month.
---
You get silenced nowadays for every little thing. Idk how widespread this was but on my server someone would type anal [insert spell/item here to make it sound funny]. And usually then people would go on for a few minutes to try and be more funny than the previous one. In Bfa someone did that and i replied ONCE with such a joke, few minutes later i was silenced for 24h. Sure not a big deal but in classic being silenced is a big fucking deal, since you know, unless your friends are on if you are silenced you cant even look for a group for anything since you actually have to use the chat for that. Coming from a company that censures the ok sign its to be expected tho.
---
It's what I look at as the representation of my self, the World would be urksom and I don't see why people are so but hurt over the idea of at least a HD texture pack option after all it wouldn't effect them if they want to see everything in low res, but the char model's and how your char looks are one of the biggest driving factors of an mmo rpg, why did people want the things like paladin tier 2? Why did people spend thousands of hrs farming and raiding? For many like me it was to look cool, but that was then and what looked cool with the tech at the time, what was impressive is defiantly not by today's standards both in wow and in gaming in general.
---
I had a level 1 twink human warrior with the blood  elf staff in tbc. They likely removed the level 10 restriction late vanilla.
---
Why does one need to raise the level cap to make an expansion enjoyable? Is having a slightly higher number really that crucial? 60 is a fine cap
---
Classes were great they could have kept them as they were imo... But they went and scrapped absolutely everything, and kept all the looping activities, then set up an artificial faction war, I mean, everything went to shit so fast it's incredible indeed! At this point I wouldn't scrap it, I would literally revert classes to Legion state for people to play them into BfA
---
You mean modelling a vanilla Dungeon, i can design a modern Dungeon by throwing a plastic Tube into an open fire for 5 minutes and let it melt some bends into it.
---
summon an infernal lol
---
&gt; he ones that got their PvE gear deserves to 1shot plebs in BGs 
---
IMO the dps meters in raids are for them not the PvP aspect of the game.
---
Well to be fair, twitch chats are pretty cringy, I can see why people wouldn't want general chat to become that. So hopefully the streamers just make their own chat channels and all their fans can go spam nonsense there.
---
MMO GAMERS CHANNEL THE ALT-RIGHT TO SUMMON THEIR MISOGYNIST gods!!!!
---
So you're the assholes playing double druid ganking me in ashenvale on my orc hunter. I killed at least 40 alliance in your honor and returned the favor lol names Fictionty btw
---
Meh. I used to raid with the player Tigerlady and he had world firsts in vanilla, raided with Vodka and Midwinter in later expansions and he said that raiding in vanilla was pretty piss easy in comparison. Even playing in one of the top vanilla guilds they had players that simply had little idea what they were doing.
---
Fondest memories of running ZF with my friends in BC. I was such a noob, who just started in BC, and my friends have been playing since Vanilla. That really felt like adventuring.
---
The whole point of resilience really was to make pvp gear that wasn’t as useful in pve (because we all know how that turns out), and to make pvp less about burst damage and more about strategy and tactics. It did a pretty good job of achieving both of these goals really. It just gets meme’d on as being bad because a lot of people hate that the arena system and the way instanced pvp became popular and a valid way of playing in tbc devalued the shared world pvp style that people value so much in vanilla.
---

Best layer for sure.
---
We had the ultimate spelling of Omar. We called for OMA/OPA and OHAR at different times. M is difficult to get right! 😂
---
Farming materials or gold or both for unique cosmetic gear would go a long way, and you are right.  The gear doesn't even need to have better stats.  I think it would be neat to see slightly stronger sets for off specs, but it isn't necessary.
---
Guild Wars, the first one, went that route in the correct way, and had a very strong population even during BC and Wrath.  WoW's strongest days as far as subscription numbers.
---
Even with that competition GW launched expansions, ran events, and still has a small, but dedicated player base today.  With none of the problems wow has experienced with power creep due to expansions.
---
TLDR: I believe that is the correct path.
---
1. It's unrealistic
---
2. People want a homogeneous game where accomplishments in one aspect of the game improves your power in all other aspects of the game.
---
As a warlock I'm thinking tailoring and enchanting, then eventually dropping enchanting for engineering. Tailoring to make some of my gear, and enchanting to just make a little money on the side, until I get to the point of endgame.
---
Not really. I played some vanilla but spent most of my playtime in TBC and WoTLK.
---
You think blizzard wont take this serious, but they will ;)
---
problem with mch is they made this new job with new skills that was just brd 2.0, the changes should give it some personal feel
---
Exactly MCH was a disaster in SB, people keep saying clunky and unwanted, only classic made me realize how good it feels to use sunder armor as a different ability.
---
Nothing is unwanted if the player plays with some thought, I agree about UI clutter but removal is not a solution.
---
Yes. Bullsh\*t city. +10 years of playing and still can't phatom how people make their way through this city.
---
I'd like to see them flesh out lower level content. Rather than make it purely endgame. Lets see all of those "noob" dungeons actually become a thing. 
---
Wouldn't it be cool if gold tooth was actually a boss at the end of a lvl 5 dungeon? I'd be really into it.
---
'DM' as well as 'VC'. Well played. :b
---
&gt;about 2g each as loot.
---
They be gettin some mad bitches now
---
Gms should summon trump in the middle of stormwind xDDDD
---
Is.. Is this possible?
---
Where to begin? 
---
1) Achievements register when the character who has done the achievement logs in, if you earned the achievement before achievements were available. You can clearly see here:  [https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/character/eu/kazzak/grimwyr/achievements/legacy/player-vs-player](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/character/eu/kazzak/grimwyr/achievements/legacy/player-vs-player)  that my pvp rank was Senior Sergeant (rank 4) and it is earned 28.5.2019, the day I logged in on that character the first time since TBC. My original wow account was created before there was over-arching [battle.net](https://battle.net) account for all wow accounts, and GM recently linked this old account to my current [battle.net](https://battle.net) account that has total of 5 wow accounts. Some achievements are account wide and thus they have registered when I logged in.
---
2) I never did timbermaw rep in classic, whats your point? I grinded the rep when I was doing reps for "the Exalted" title. 
---
3) What 2016 glad achi? My only glad achi/mount is from TBC, on my warlock:  [https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/character/eu/genjuros/mhagix/achievements/feats-of-strength/mounts](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/character/eu/genjuros/mhagix/achievements/feats-of-strength/mounts)  (Merciless Nether Drake at the bottom, achievement earned 27.10.2008)
---
4) I'm not 100% sure what is my earliest achievement, but I'm fairly sure its close the above mentioned 27.10.2008. Achievements were introduced in WOTLK pre-patch during TBC and I have logged in around that time.
---
5) Wrath twink?  Not possible to have actual dreadnought pieces since Naxx was moved to Northrend. You can believe what you want, I know I cleared vanilla naxx and despite it being a pretty big sacrifice in terms of time spent, I  have fond memories of the time. I'm sorry if it makes you feel angry.
---
Heres the GM response to my ticket:

[https://i.imgur.com/WqWlNWn.png](https://i.imgur.com/WqWlNWn.png)
---
Many people like resilience and how it shifted the one-shot-fiesta of Vanilla twoard the end to a more strategic game.
---
Now it also has downsides: 
---
* Some people liked the one-shot-fiesta of Vanilla and not the 'healers running around a pillar for 10min' arena.
---
* It makes PvP stuff useless in PvE and vice versa. One might say it's a good thing since it doesn't force people to do content they don't like but one another might say that IT IS the problem. 
---
* It kinda make you feel less powerful: you reach lvl70 and you deal massive damage and 6 months later when you have raided for hours for big shiny loot, you find yourself unable to kill a holy paladin with 9000 resilience just /dance during  3hours because you have negative crit change and hit like as asthmatic lvl32 warior with helm of the whale
---
ahhh i see!  yeah it was something of an epic journey to get to BFD if you were born in the eastern kingdoms haha - but that was part of the magic in vanilla
---
was it the barov family?
---
It's a terrible system because now you need a separate gear set for both PvE and PvP. I absolutely loathed it.
---
Vanilla is the best iteration, you can do both PvP and PvE in whichever gear you want, even if doing PvE in PvP gear is not very optimal.
---
Shhhh! Omar coming...
---
Right. 
---
Memes and truly obnoxious will be an improvement. I'm sure the #nochanges crowd will do their best to avoid that happening.
---
Yeah I don't think too many who went from vanilla to BC wants that to start happening again.
---
Holy shit I remember that picture. The community back then I'd the best community I have ever encountered.
---
I remember seeing a picture on league of legends of 5 thresh characters doing the same with lanterns, wasn't quite the same feeling but I remember that Pic bringing be back.
---
&gt; It did a pretty good job of achieving both of these goals really 
---
So Resilience overall was not that bad, it just came with a package of different "not so much liked" features.
---
Yeah, its the place that your mom likes to meet me for snacks.
---
I'm actually fairly glad. I haven't had a disk drive since about 2010. 
---
When I have needed one in the past, I unplugged one from an older rig and installed windows or whatever. Now there is no reason unless you cant get hold of a boot drive.

In 1999 NATO had conducted a series of bridge bombings along Danube in Yugoslavia, which OP witnessed when he or she was 11. The river is a major link from Southern Germany all the way to the Black Sea so it restricted a lot of transportation and trade to the Balkans. Unfortunate circumstances for the people living there...OP found solace in playing World of Warcraft.
---
Fair enough, I still think it's a term that's now used *way* too broadly by most people online to mean "thing I don't agree with said in a mean way", based on how I've seen it evolve over the years. I don't think there was anything wrong with the words rude, impolite, unpleasant, condescending, everything you used above. They give a little more definition to what someone's trying to say, like how condescending and unpleasant aren't mutually exclusive definitions. To many, those words would now just roll together into a blanket term meaning "bad", and I hate it. I just see the use of the word as a red flag that someone can't think of anything better to say or argue. Just my thought.
---
I want to try my hand at raiding in vanilla! I want to keep it "casual" though, since I'm not looking into hardcore guilds.
---
I was thinking healer - probably holy priest. What do you think?
---
He was last seen entering goldshire... ripp
---
Woah dude thats too brutal!
---
Had it stuck in my head all week!
---
Shadow priest or ele shaman? Mainly considering PVP and some solo world pvp
---
&gt; Between Vanilla and Cataclysm expansion of wow this damn held back a vast lake between the wetlands zone and the loch modan zone in the eastern kingdoms.
---
&gt; During the cataclysm it was destroyed by an angry dragon called Deathwing. He told us that we thought we liked it, but we dont.
---
Aw what?! Gone too soon &lt;\3
---
Stuff like this is what I'd love to see added after a full life cycle.
---
They could add an npc to enable an iron man challenge that tracks you on a leaderboard available in game.
---
His name is Fozruk, not Korzuk xD
---
Depends what you mean by pve.
---
Engineering is good for pve aswell while levelling, doing dungeons or hard quests. That zapper trinket can save your butt on a hard quest mob fx. 
---
If you mean pve as in raiding then sure, engineering might not help that much, and i would recommend alcy then to keep costs low on consumables.
---
&gt; it’s something they’ve wanted to do for a long time.
---
'We were only *PRETENDING* to be retarded..." 
---
Sure, Ion
---
What people find cringy is incredibly arbitrary though. I'm sure a lot of people would have found ye olden chat just as cringy if not more so.
---
As a future classic mage, what would be the best emotes to let them know?
---
&gt;It's unrealistic
---
Could you get more in detail with that? 
---
IMO it makes it realistic
---
\**heavy RP incoming*\*
---
If I am the Best Dragonslayer of Azeroth, it makes sense to make more Damage on a Dragon fight because I know how to deal with it.
---
If I am the Gurubashi Arena Gladiator, I am able to kill everyone in a 1vs1 scenario.
---
If an Gladiator fights a dragon or the Dragonslayer fights a PvPer it makes sense to not be the very best.
---
200k petition bro
---
That's the thing, It does not HAVE TO be a joke in classic if you don't want it to be. It's all about interaction with other players. In retail it's all about endgame, cause basically you do not interact with anyone during lvling. In vanilla, you do not have to race, beacuse there is pleanty to do while leveling. I, for example, am planning to lvl slowly, doing every dungeon along my way to 60, and have fun. I always loved pvp in STV so I always level there. Will i die a lot there? Yes. Would it be faster to just skip it? Yes. But leveling there and having fun pvping with others is always awesome. 
---
You have to make a complete 180 on your thought process when it comes to playing. Why do you want to race to endgame? There is pleanty of time for everything because classic is finite and every content is known from the start.

Exactly this. Vanilla should be left as it is.
---
Queue up TBC.
---
You misunderstand me. I think adding the expansions in any way is terrible.  
---
Either leave classic untouched or create new content specifically for classic.
---
Although I admit, your  idea is an interesting take.
---
A Freeze effect, magical debuff.
---
I think we're gonna see a weird amalgamation of boomer / zoomer humour (Poet laureate over here). I ran into both 14 year olds and 40 year olds during the stress test and it was a weird, but pretty funny experience.
---
Where’s Waldo?
---
PogU!
---
Going to be a little sad seeing this throughout the game but it's all good baby we going home!
---
Np you just gotta inv them to party, pop bloodrage and give em battle shout before they pass you too far.
---
All these zones could be ok but the rewards from the content could end up ruining the game. I think the focus should be on long quest chains and WPvP. 
---
I do agree Karazhan, Gilneas and Eversong Woods would be the best starting points for new zones.
---
Me too xD
---
The bears dancing on the side make the video haha
---
they better keep doing this after its LIVE!!!!
---
what is your point ? are you talking about yourself ?
---
I tried to do some research to see if K3 has overtuned it's damage values, but all I could find were threads like those I sent you (I can't post them on this subreddit), which if anything suggest that K3 is undertuned to make for easier leveling. Although the pserver devs say that they're trying for an authentic blizzlike experience.
---
&gt; I just said with proof pservers are overtuned on purpose.
---
You didn't provide any proof of anything. I'm not sure what comment you're referring to. I'm just curious to know what Classic will be like compared to K3. I seriously hope it isn't any easier.
---
Sappers do an average of 600 damage on a 5 minute cooldown, that's a whopping 2 DPS. Far from manditory
---
Omar is a blizzard employee and is basically the one that made classic possible. He locked himself up a week in the Blizz HQ and made the base for classic in a manner that Blizz was like "ok that looks good, we can do it"
---
Just remember that we cleared the content without add-ons, without guides, without YouTube videos and all the other assistance people have nowadays. I was getting invited as a priest to heal level 60 dungeons starting from level 55 and it went fine. I cleared mc and bwl without ever downranking spells or using any addon except the raidframes one. Don't over think it. You'll be fine.
---
Isnt there already a WoW ironman community?  No grouping or equipping anythijg other than greys/whites iirc.  Plus no deaths ofc
---
Are you tanking? The most appreciated of all is a top tier tank 👀
---
Man I'm so bored after work currently. U and me both my guy.
---
And when the ignorant dev sayeth: YOu think you do...
---
Basèd omar pronounced...: *But I do*.
---
The Daily Heil would be all for that though
---
Sure we cant speak for everyone but the streamers that actively still play retail enjoying classic a lot more than retail, although they were skeptical at first. Preach was always skeptical of classic and mentioned it in any podcast he was, he said he would check it out but he didnt think that people would enjoy it as much as they think or something along those lines, since the beta he has changed his stance and even said that the other day he went mythic raiding which was the only thing he enjoyed in retail and even during the raid that he was just thibking about going back to play classic. Venruki is an arena player who won blizzcon (arenas which arent a thing in classic and its the main thing he does) made a video about how he was wrong about classic and that he thought it was just nostalgia but that he was wrong, that the game really was that good. Cdew is a streamer from method and he is also hooked and also said things along those lines. Yeah we dont know what  regular joe thinks but what we can know is what streamers think and maybe thats an indication of what the general consensus is and maybe its not, but i would put my bet on the former.
---
The only reason I might be rolling alliance.  I have played alliance for years now and want a change. But man, I'm still excited every time I think about leveling in Loch Modan for example.
---
I honestly cannot wait to experience it in full. I'm somewhere in the middle so I imagine I'll have a similar time as you.
---
twitch streamers and their fanboys are all cancer , they ruin everything they touch , any server with twitch streamers is instant avoid
---
Oh i'd also like to say that 6 years ago I posted about new info about titan: 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1f9zbt/next_blizzard_mmo_titan_delayed_till_2016/
---
&gt;Everyone's been fighting the "no changes" battle since day one, and now we let in a system that is disturbingly different than the vanilla experience.
---
It shouldn't be all that different unless you yourself actively try to exploit the system yourself. 
---
You should still see the same people from your realm. It's just that you won't see all of them at the same time. Some days you would see players A, B and C, other days you would see players X, Y and Z. Over extended play you would see players A,B,C,X,Y and Z multiple times assuming you all leveled at the approximate same pace.
---
I would argue that Layering isn't a problem unless you intend to make it a problem for yourself. If you just play the game, it shouldn't really matter. 
---
Yes, if you intend to be in the top 1% on your server it sucks having to exploit layering in order to keep up, but for the 99% who just play the game it shouldn't be all that noticeable. 
---
I believe the issues with it are blown a bit out of proportion, but that is just my perception of it. I have been in the stress test queues, and believe that it is one aspect of Vanilla we don't need to emulate 100%. Layering as a trade-off doesn't seem that bad in comparison.
---
Doing some digging, looks like both Maul and Swipe have a 1.75 threat multiplier (removed in 2.0.3) which would swing it back in favor vs imp thorns.
---

I don't see how multiple raid difficulties kill sense of progression. Other games unlock "hard modes" and whatnot after you beat them on normal and only when you beat the "hard mode" you have completed that shit 100%.
---
I can proudly say I have no idea what the fuck that means.
---
I just hope the community can strike a healthy balance, for ever 4 letter nonsense work that gets spammed, we'll get 1 chuck norris joke.

yeah, baine. and saurfang.

Just stop

what is your point ? exactly ?

&gt; 'healers running around a pillar for 10min' arena. 
---
IMO That's a problem with arenas and not resilience :b

&gt; negative crit change and hit like as asthmatic lvl32 warior

Did not know that it was that bad, thank you

How was this possible!?

TBC zones are designed for flying mount.. so for TBC it is not bad
---
Waiting for Classic
---
&gt; How do we stop Azeroth from turning into a ghost town in the wake of Outlands? 
---
Don't nerf previous content, don't accelerate leveling speed, don't raise the level cap past 30, don't make Shattrath a one-stop shop for everything one might need (no alchemy lab for example).
---
&gt;Would the Hybrids receive the love they deserved in TBC, or would that not be considered “Truly Vanilla”?
---
Classes were retuned and rebalanced all throughout vanilla. Some of those classes just never received their major refinements until TBC. Shamans for example saw a lot of enhancement nerfs throughout vanilla but their improvements were delayed until TBC. So yeah, I think we can implement some of those improvements within the scope of Classic. I doubt the intention was to design entire spec lines just to be completely useless by end-game.
---
For blizzard it wasn't an option to run the old and buggy 1.12 client that most servers use. (For obvious reasons). So they had to find a way to get the old 1.12 assets (models, textures, movement, data for damage, quests etc) into the new client. And after rewriting some to fit into the new client. Omar Gonzales proved that it was possible by re creating the dwarf starting zone in the newest wow client. That made the project get green lit and couple years later and you're in the classic stress test.
---
really? short fat bearded mole people? alliance can keep them.
---
Agreed, I feel like I've done this in the past. It's similar to buffing people after a hearthstone cast.
---
Just like a LIGHT summoning, shoutouts to the hez
---
So difficulties aren't bad, there's just too many..?
---
Wall jumping.  
---
You couldn't cap anything but you could get next to a flag ready to as soon as the game started.
---
Grand Exchange was polled before it was added to osrs. It passed with 76% approval
---
Yeah unfortunately I think we'll see very little of that after the first couple of weeks and we'll just see Pogchamp when Rag drops.
---
i agree , the despicable catalysm expansion ruined the old world so much it still disgust me.. 
---
i mean submerged thousands needles ? really ?
---
Well no, because layering isn't *necessary* to having those large initial populations. Like I originally stated, everyone is inexplicably over-exaggerating the problems of launching with a larger population and at the same time downplaying the massive consequences that layering introduces.
---
Yeah thats true, i also dont like it as a differenciate of PvE and PvP gear. Its true that is a lot more inmersive to have just gear, not “kind of” gear.
---
But at the end of vanilla the difference in damage between players in pvp was too extreme, it was quite frustrating. I mean I agree someone geared to have an advantage over others, not not THAT much, something had to be done.
---
So you're not going to be playing then? Excellent. Judging by your view I reckon we won't be missing you too much.
---
The problem was that it's difficult to balance classes around PvE and PvP at the same time, without making one spec op in any part of the game. With resilience they were able to (try) balance them individually.

#EBIC SWORD DROP BOISSS
---
Here's the definition of ugly in a [picture](http://i.imgur.com/PA5Xw3N.jpg)
---
I get what you're saying, but I'm talking about alts. Definitely don't need to do all that if you're just wanting to chill out and watch a TV show or film whilst grinding out quests/mobs.
---
First time around for some people sure it's obviously better to avoid it, and nobody will be focusing more on what they're watching than what they're playing.
---
So you rolling alliance or horde mate?
---
I think it's mostly the spammy nature of twitch chats that people don't want carrying over, not the actual content.
---
It would be nice if I can type "LF2M Dps/Tank SMcath" and have it not get pushed out of the chat window immediately by people typing a single word in a vain attempt to get noticed by their idol.
---
based on the survey of class leveling speed in vanilla , Hunter and Druid are the fastest , Warrior and Paladin the slowest , Priest is not that bad but you need to get a Wand ASAP at low level .. the crafted Wand from enchanting is powerful for low levels
---
In Vanilla that was actually Alliance. But when people started to min/max a lot more, Horde turned out to be significantly better - so people started switching.
---
&gt;I make and sell video game hacks/cheats/bots and sell gold/accounts from my websites, and I will be selling gold from vanilla. 
---
Got it, you're scum. Imagine bragging about creating cheats and selling gold.
---
So you are enjoying all the "Gather me 20 pelts/candles/furs and kill 15 boars/gnolls/kobolds" quests?
---
"fk this im getting my main" x70 people = epic wPvP
---
Because it's a MMORPG.
---
I don't understand why people are wanting TBC after waiting so long for classic.
---
Why not experiment with classic and add content which is in spirit with classic.
---
This is not a case of someone who has a history of bullshitting throwing a bunch of factual claims out there. He's presenting an argument. You evaluate arguments on the basis of their merit, not that of the person making them.
---
There's, but it's retail.
---
hmm , remember there bound to be a bit of glitch on launch day where millions of players hit the servers at the same time. i suggest you start the game on the same day as your friend , so you wont get annoyed by any problem that occured
---
Also lots of elitist raiders thinking they deserve to delete actual pvp players because they were in a raid pressing 1 button over and over.
---
Didn't TBC already have it's fair share of dailies, and rep grinds have been in the game since literally forever?
---
About PvP, DKs at start were horrendously op but something to hard counter resto druids don't seem bad in my book at least. PvP got faster I know that, but globaling people came a thing in Cata iirc. WotLK still rewarded skill and that can be seen as the top comps were still RMP very VERY often.
---

mana mana!

Thunder Bluff has the dopest music of all Horde capitals, with Silvermoon being a close second.
---
This together with the sights and somewhat clustered vendors, AH, bank and mailbox make it the absolute favorite capital on Horde side for me.
---
Been doing no addons on Pservers, I plan to use them while leveling my first character on classic though. Idk why I guess I'm just weird
---
Hardcore modes suck, they honestly do. I understand the concept is to make every encounter exciting and provide real challenge, but all it does is make people overgear/level/stat for content and play very safe and boring. And then eventually a DC or some other absolute bullshit kills them and they start over.

Ironman in vanilla would literally just be a hunter killing 5 lvl below you mobs one at the time until 60.
---
#NO CHANGES!!
---
The website is wrong, all dungeons are for 5 ppl, only UBRS was for 15 ppl. original. They changed it to 10 later.
---
I don't think that sort of one-word spam was acceptable back then and I doubt it will be now. This is still beta so the mods are probably more lenient until the full release.
---
Never thought about it, but i remmember clearly my first time in there, felt epic.We couldnt summon boss,cos no1 has done quest or smth:d
---
i haven't even begun to peak
---
You have seen so many videos because the most popular streamer playing Beta is Asmongold who plays alliance. That is not on Blizzard or the GMs in particular.
---
(Also after many years of horde bias I think personally we can actually have some Alliance bias this time :-P)
---
I'm following this. I know. I've watched all the videos you mentioned. I'm watching Preach doing Wailing Caverns at this very moment. And I have hopes for the streamer's joy to infect their audience.
---
There's a good chance classic will be successful, especially with the backing of such influencers. But we cannot know. At the end of the day we have no data on whether or not the non hardcore crowd will enjoy it. They can, totally. But will they? We will see. I sure hope so.

Engineering is simply too good to pass up, for pretty much any main I'd say.. dunno about healers, as I do not play them.
---
&gt; been saying this from the start.
---
Yarp. Still have my eyeballs bleed when I read about the slippery slope after pointing this out (it's not a fallacy if the slope is real, and we already have the entire slope laid out in this case). My personal cloud castle would be a Classic that opens itself to the idea of horizontal progressions, i.e. where not every new content means "power increase", but where the power level within the entire gaming world are constants that characters can move around in, but where there is a defined upper limit, and where further progression leads along paths that open up, for example, new abilities that further your character in other ways than sheer Oomph. Why not get "secondary" talent trees with later expansions, similar to the Path of Titans that was planned for WotLK? Talent trees that do not increase your character's power directly, but that twist and alter your existing abilities in a way that changes your play style? Or introduce new ones that you can only use if you deactivate some of your old ones, giving players the power to mix and match, *if* they put in the time and effort to attain those side-grades.
---
Point being: One of the big draws I see surfacing more and more for Classic is that it has that solid sense of "power constants in the world". In fact, one of the biggest criticisms of BC back then was that it completely shattered this solid scope by introducing green quest rewards that outclassed raid gear. I dislike the idea of content becoming irrelevant for everyone after a set time, but I get that in order to keep people interested, you need to have a steady influx of new things to do and discover. Sidegrades, horizontal progression does that. A veteran will maybe not be that much more powerful than a newbie, but he'll have a lot of tools that the newbie does yet have to attain. The newbie can maybe throw Flash Heals just as well as the veteran - but the veteran can decide that he'd rather not use Flash Heal at all, and switch it out with a damage soaker that refunds its entire mana cost if it soaks a certain amount of damage, but transfers any remaining "soak" as damage to the caster after it expires before that threshold is reached: One spell is a general, dependable application thing that anyone can use well; the other has a risk-reward mechanic attached that takes some expertise to take advantage of.
---
Still a better story than BFA, don't you agree? :)

&gt;If I am the Best Dragonslayer of Azeroth, it makes sense to make more Damage on a Dragon fight because I know how to deal with it.  
---
&gt;If I am the Gurubashi Arena Gladiator, I am able to kill everyone in a 1vs1 scenario.  
---
&gt;If an Gladiator fights a dragon or the Dragonslayer fights a PvPer it makes sense to not be the very best.
---
It's hard to make it more RPG than that :b
---
If you think different pls tell me why
---
Because classic has no arena and the raids are easy as fuck compared to tbc.
---
Also most classes get a few more buttons which makes the game more fun to play.
---
My first complaint is that Resilience makes no sense narratively. It's bad for immersion, because it reveals the artificial nature of the game world, acknowledging that players and NPCs are substantially different. Why does this armour protect you a lot from one guy's frostbolt, but not that other guy's? There's no in-setting reason.
---
My second complaint is that Resilience splits the playerbase, because now people interested in high end PvP literally do nothing BUT PvP. And organised PvP does not require significant interaction with the rest of the world, unlike raiding.
---
My third complaint is that Resilience (and developer dependence on it) actually limits player choice, basically forcing PvPers into a single stream of linear gear improvements, rather than having a cool mix of weird sidegrades and such from all over the game. This also kinda plays into the fun of weird itemisation, rather than having all gear be strictly optimised for specific purposes, since optimal stat ratios and such are different between PvP and different raids. And even more importantly for PvP, it limited the ability of the meta to self-adjust in response to dominant trends. Without resilience, you get people alternating between differently statted pieces of gear to account for meta trends (e.g. stack shadow resistance to counteract a surge in Warlocks, stack stamina to counteract burst/combo builds, etc.) With it, the solution is always "stack Resilience or die."
---
Yeah, it helped with PvP balance. But it was a damn lazy and unsatisfying method of balancing the game.
---
tbh streamers kinda remind me of the kid who got the gameboy first and felt like they were the 'chosen one' or some shit, and they gloried in making their friends watch them play, talking to them as if they knew everything about it
---
Do you like to fear and trigger people or would you prefer to poly and trigger people?

---
You fly there... not that hard. In PVP servers there used to be some ganking, basicly why pvp servers exists.
---
imagine they picked up what they left off from the original. Karazhan was supposed to be in vanilla. Then also finish that huge battleground in Azshara. Sweet freaking dream boys
---
As long as there is an addon I can use to ignore unlimited amounts of people I don't  care.  (I also don't care that this limits my pool of potential group mates  as I don't want to play with anybody I determine block worthy in chat. )
---
This.
---
It split the player base. Destroyed world pvp. I raided up to full tier 5 and got full s3 gear during TBC. With my pvp gear on I could go out in the world and 4v1 the other faction. It took all the fun out of ganking for me. Dampening wasn’t a thing yet either in arena. I remember going up against nothing but Resto Druid/X in twos above 1900 rating and the matches lasted 30+ minutes. Shit was dumb.
---
He's the Mod Ash of WoW PogChamp
---
Why not do BOTH? revamping TBC will be relatively low overhead once classic is done.
---
I wouldn't use Smite since you have to pay for next ranks. Mind Blast dot wand is enough imo.
---
&gt; Its true that is a lot more inmersive to have just gear, not “kind of” gear. 
---
I disagree, it's much more immersive IMO. You would not take the same equipment to fight a giant dragon than to fight an enemy your size.
---
&gt; I agree someone geared to have an advantage over others, not not THAT much, something had to be done. 
---
So was the system bad or the numbers just too high?
---
Eh, its been done.
---
This build is not optimal for many reasons:
---
**Lawbringer:**  This set is really poor.  138 +heal, 1% Crit, and 134 int.  You can wear 2 blues and get (35 int, 68 +heal).  There is a ton of stats traded for 10% JoL healing, and a chance to melee heal for 200.  
---
**Talents:** Imp Dev and Imp Conc (2/3lol) = bad, Imp HoJ = pvplul, Kings + Sanct = bad, 3%+ hit because lolret..., Imp Bom?  This fucking talent build is so wasteful.
---
People tried this at 60 and it was shit.  It will be shit again.
---
Judgment of Light is good, and 3pcT1 is OK.  8pcT1 is shit.  JoL can be brought by any paladin.  More often, you will be using Judgment of Wisdom, because TotalHealing=BossHP/RaidDPS, and JoW increases raid dps while JoL does not.  Classic WoW is not HPS bound like retail.
---
8pcT1 is so fucking bad.  He got 8 procs in 1 min, which is better than I expected, but this is PServer bullshit so ^_^.  8*200*5= 8,000 useful healing in 1 min, but I can almost grantee you that this proc-rate is too high, there are original comments that question if the proc even happens.  8ppm is crazy high, but he is spending 250 mana to get those 8 procs, so I will let him have it.  
---
So far, we have +10% JoL and some random party heals.  And the spec does nothing.  Lets talk about the spec:
---
This idiot has A) Improved Might, B) Kings, and C) Sanctuary.  This is 6 wasted talent points, 6!.  Pve/Pvp Holy/Prot will get Kings, Pve/Pvp Holy/Ret will get ImpMight.  Getting all 3 is just stupid.  Getting Improved Devo Aura and Improved Conc aura is equally bad.  You will only ever have one up, and the rest will always be wasted.  Raids want one token paladin with ImpDevo, and typically it is better to have your other paladins run Resistance or Concentration (or Sanctity if Ret).  Group Auras are always a juggle and top players will always optimize for DPS via Concentration aura over optimizing for HPM via Devotion Aura.  Because this talent build will be meleing 'lol', he wastes 3 more points in +hit.  Now, +3% hit is great in a pve/pvp hybrid build, but not in a raid build.
---
TLDR:  JoW &gt; JoL, Conc &gt; Devo, the talent points are all over the place, and what do you do past 8pcT1?
---
PvE gear were always useful in arena depending on comp, at least in tbc/wotlk. Going for resilience cap was always dumb and you had to sacrifice so much damage/stats for it.

Do they? How are they different from macros?  
---
You don't even need add-ons, you can just write the scripts in an in-game macro; Blizzard has provided all this, how does it violate TOS? (It very well might, I'm just not aware how.)
---
This is absolutely brilliant! Great work with the screenie angles!
---
Question for you or anyone else though, I am fairly new to reddit (been a lurker for years), I am going to post some of my own screenies from the beta to a thread but was curious how you post your pics like this without it just being a link and actually having them show up in the post. Is there just an "\[img\]" tag thing?

Thanks

Grummy worked on vanilla.  I dont care about anything else.

Thank you for your detailed response, one question; could they just use the Crit Rating system they implemented in TBC to account for the awkward look of 1.5%? Or does that potentially open up a can of worms?

I was reading an article were Blizzard said originally it seemed impossible, or nearly there so it wasn't worth the cost of attempting it. Then a dev (Omar?) came up with an idea of how it might work and it only took a few weeks to get a glitchy version of 1.12 running on the current client, at that point it was no longer impossible, just difficult.
---
I heard Cdew say he was considering enh
---
Scholo and Strat were capped at 10
---
Originally, Stratholme and Scholomance were capped at 10 players and UBRS was capped at 15, after caps were put in 1.3:
---
[http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Patch\_1.3.0](http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Patch_1.3.0)
---
It was only later that they retuned the instance and capped them at 5 each, and UBRS at 10, with 1.10.
---
Wow that's crazy it didn't work out with some chick that left her bf for another one.
---
Have you even played the new dungeons?
---
If you compare garbage like Ragefire Chasm to any dungeon in any expansion then Ragefire Chasm will lose out by a LOT.
---
New dungeons should get some hate, mostly because they are linear and designed around speed runs.
---
But they look great, have more interesting boss mechanics and stuff like that.
---
The last screenshot where Omar is standing above the masses like a god is truly amazing
---
Thanks, Sherlock!
---
Right, back then if one person made a macro and spammed chat 100 times the system would automatically mute them for a short time for spamming. 
---
What people are concerned about now is that if 100 people type one thing and flood the chatlog, that's not technically spam. And the automatic system can't detect that and hand out mutes to 100 people who aren't technically spamming. 
---
Also, the /ignore list has a finite amount of space so even if a user wanted to painstakingly block all those people, they couldn't get them all. And it wouldn't help their lfg messages not get pushed off. 
---
But like I said, hopefully this doesn't happen to general/trade/world and people just make their own chat channels.
---
I wish for a day blizz rickrolled us and made this a mechanic in the game.
---
But the bosses are significantly easier than private servers. 
---
Certain bosseson pservers were extremely hard (overturned af arcane explosion spamming skeram in aq40 was hardest boss til viscidous / ouro).
---
Vanilla wow be a piece of piss regardless of parry.
---
Your mistake is confusing feral tank with ret paladin or spriest or even feral dps - this is not a barely viable meme spec that requires tons of consumables to work. Feral tank is an optimal offtank through all tiers of content; practically speaking there is no noticable difference in the early game between a prot warrior and a feral tank survivability, and the baseline threat of a feral without MCP is still much higher. 
---
If someone is really so casual they cannot be bothered to do 2-3 lockouts worth of farming per week, they're probably in a casual guild with DPS that is not good enough to challenge a feral's baseline threat anyway, so they won't even need MCPs.
---
For a short time, you could wall-climb out of the starting area before the match started. Don't remember what patch it was but it was fixed reasonably quickly.
---
But why. If memory serves – it's been almost nine years – we all logged in at the nearest graveyard.
---
Yah having lvl 70 hunters perch on the spires in Garadar and grief lowbies was cool. this definitely needed to be implemented.
---
They just as easily could have designed Outland to not need flying
---
naga mage, warlock, warrior, and priests.
---
I mean there will always be a way to get out. They added invisible walls all over the place in the new version of WSG, but for classic they needed to take the old map. So there aren't any invisible walls, yet. 
---
This is definitely an exploit, not just exploration. Even if you don't hold the flag, it's one less player for your team. I loved to explore the World of Warcraft with wall walking/jumping, ability abuse and model changing back then, and I may be doing it again, so I'm team #nochange for the overworld and instances. But battlegrounds is something different. Some invisible walls won't hurt. With Reddit, YouTube and other exploit sharing platforms, everyone will know how to do these exploits and you will have this kind of thing in every match. So please Blizzard, add some invisible walls.
---
Out of interest, what *is* the best for flag carrying?
---
My bad... my memorys...well...it has been a long time. :)
---
Depends. PvP. Warlock 100%
---
PVE? Probably Mage. Warlock is more than capable but if you car about raid numbers then mage until naxx gear.
---
I main a warlock and there is seldom a PvP situation I can't win. 1v1 I win 95%
---
Players don't know what they want or what's good for a game as a whole they will vote with personal bias. Everyone applauded blizz for the QOL changes back in wotlk as example without thinking about the long term consequences.
---
As a warlock, best I can do is Unending Breath, I'm sure everyone appreciates it.
---
I’ll elaborate for you to help the OP. You seem to have done a lot of reading but not much playing.
---
What you’re referring to applies to PROGRESSION raiding BEYOND TIER 2 only. Hardly a good reason to avoid the class.
---
&gt;I really like the idea to keep low level mats relevant.
---
or just use them at endgame too.
---
Amen!
---
How hard is stance dancing? 
---
I’ve tanked as a Druid in TBC, and a Paladin in WotLK, how much of a shock am I in for trying a Warrior tank for the first time?
---
Still more attractive than any horde.
---
everyone gets ONE house, and THRALLS THERE, and EVERYONE ELSE IS TOO
---
not at all
---
more parry-&gt; less threat -&gt; fury prot is even more important

That is unironically the worst part about rolling warrior for me: not being able to heal/buff other players in the open world.

Thanks for your kind words ! I try to use my photography skills (beginner) when taking screenshots. Glad you found your way around reddit, I was too just a lurker for years. Just started posting the past few months.

Because it makes pvp slow and boring as fuck.

Sharding is a technology used to optimize server ressource utilization on the one hand, and ensure areas are either populated with players if few people are playing and there is no overpopulation if too many people are playing.
---
Forsaken are led by a literal former High Elf. It makes perfect sense for me she makes a pact with Blood Elves because the very reason they switched the name from High Elves is the reason Sylvanas is undead. I think Naga, Forsaken and Blood Elves makes a lot of sense from a faction perspective.
---
No idea where you took the Broken Draenei from as they are not present on Azeroth - they live in the Outland.
---
I'd keep NElf as their own faction without any additional races there and have them the only race that could be a Druid (no more Druid Taurens) but make them the only Neutral faction (not hostile to others unless attacked and for which you could farm reputation to make hostile or friendly).
---
Blood Elves of course wouldn't be able to be paladins and the only "unique" class for that faction I can think of would have to be some sort of spellbreaker-like anti-mage melee caster.
---
It is because the Alliance is literally in ruins due to Horde favoritism.
---
And Blizzard instead of fixing it, went ahead and skimmed the situation for money with a discount on transfers to trigger a lot of guilds to go over.
---
We're dying, and Horde still manages to whine. Just lol.
---
&gt; How have I played this game for close to 12 years and didn’t know about this?
---
It's even the Cataclysm [cinematic](https://youtu.be/Wq4Y7ztznKc?t=112).
---
Very very easy to perform the action, the difficulty is more in knowing when to do it and managing the rage. Still pretty easy overall.
---
I am aware. But money earned by screwing people over is not something worth bragging about IMO. And im not talking about your costumer but the whole playerbases that have to play with your costumers.
---
Yeah!!

There are already a lot of good and informative comments. I just want to add two random/minor notes:

\- with the engi meta, there will be shitload of stuns flying towards you disguised as a Nade

\- undead female animations are the best in my opinion (flippin special atk/hemo + back spin kick? hell yeah!)

i had the same struggle, but for now i settled with orc for sure (kekwatchmesweat in august)

Spam Tab Execute
---
For me numbers where too high with gear past BWL, you just didn't have ANY chance to counter somebody with that gear, even if you did the most amazing skilled tricks of all time and executed perfectly, you just got deleted.
---
I still don't agree about inmersion. I understand what you mean, but as someone said, I think it's better to be able to choose between all the gear in game to do all the stuff, instead of just between a few items focused on one activity.
---
Jesus could walk on water, Omar can swim on land.

I thought the Cataclysm patch teleported all characters to the nearest graveyard when it came out.

I know some won't. But as soon as you make it competitive that's what happens. Anyway there's a hardcore mode community for retail, it can probably work in vanilla too iguess.
---
Shadowmeld is underrated. kinda worthless for druids and rogues but I love it as a hunter with a cat pet using prowl. Endless fun turning the table on rogues.
---
but what is true brutality if not Vanilla
---
Figure that, it's almost like people like to interact with the people behind the product. The real talent, the developers and others who care about the product more than the bottomline as opposed to their soulless overlords.

The Night Elf one is a bit dodgy though, twice mentioning Dolanaar Delivery
---
This sounds like something from dwarf fortress
---
I've been playing on a private server the past couple of days, so this may not be accurate on Classic.
---
I waltzed into Westfall at level 10, and instantly found that my Rogue was simply not strong enough to kill any of the mobs wondering around the zone, apart from the vultures. Loch Modan had a bunch of quests that were more level appropriate, and I managed to complete them fairly effortlessly. I think 10-13 in Loch Modan is probably not a bad idea on one of the weaker levelling classes.
---
The Azshara zone made me the most sad/mad
---
Coming from a family that played Diablo 2 hardcore *heavily* we've always wanted this. Imagine what the ingame economy would look like haha
---
You also need seperate sets for tanking/healing if you're a hybrid set. You need resistance sets for resistance bosses  
---
I fail to see the distinction here about why it's a problem to need different gear for different situations.
---
I'm afraid that Blizzard can't develop true enough to the philosophies of Vanilla. I'm not saying they absolutely can't, just I'm apprehensive. Also TBC is a waaaay easier route for Blizzard to go.
---
You mean nova &gt; blast wave so you get shatter crit on everyone proccing ignite. The best method for Aoeing a group like this would be:
---
Goblin mortar (5sec aoe stun trinket) &gt; Flamestrike &gt; nova &gt; blast wave and sapper charge (sapper isn't on GCD) &gt; cone of cold &gt; cold snap &gt; nova &gt; cone of cold &gt; arcane explosion anyone still alive. Also make sure you put fire-ward on first so you asorb the damage sapper charge does to you.
---
Level in DPS though. Warrior leveling is slow and it’s a grind unless you’ve got pocket heals. Switch to prot at endgame. You can still tank earlier instances species for DPS.
---
well, as an orc there you go:

---
They changed it in 1.3, but not everything is 1.12 in Classic. Cross-realm BGs weren't in 1.12 either.
---
Imagine playing vanilla as a warrior ONLY for 15 years and still not having a start attack, yikers

So first off, ill say i will no doubt be downvoted because this subreddit has a hard on for praising mediocrity and not wanting to try to be the best you can be. But thats okay because this comment is for your sake to read. Dont listen to these people saying youll be fine and dandy no matter what you decide to go. If you are already asking the question of minmaxing then you probably are the type of person that doesnt like the idea of being at a decent disadvantage as default while  playing the game in comparison to other specs. For example, you might have taken some of these peoples advices and ended up picking druid to play balance spec cause you liked the idea of it. Well, its a fucking shit spec dont listen to someone saying they arent because they really are, thats the truth many of these "play whatever you want" guys wont tell you. Sure youll have fun cause the game is fun in general, but only up until the point youve made a big mistake and wasted several hundred hours to hit 60 just to realize many guilds arent fond of bringing balance druids into their raid. You will be limited to available guilds to raid with. You will be limited to more casual guilds, hell even some casual guilds dont want them some have standards but just are more lax and easy going in other aspects of raiding. When a boomkin outputs literally half as much damage as a tier1 dps class theres a problem there. At this point you could either go feral tank or feral dps or resto for healing. Feral tanks are not going to be main tanks in 99% of guilds so if you rolled druid thinking of being main tank then thats a no can do. You can tank 5 mans perfectly fine sure, but you would be a 2nd or 3rd string tank in raids which isnt as fun as main tanking. So then theres feral dps, which are sometimes accepted into semihardcore/hardcore guilds so long as they put in some effort to get the most out of their potential and arent complete shit with maxing their potential. They are useful at interchangeably switching from dps to tank when its needed for certain fights. For healing, they are completely viable every guild will want 2 generally. Then theres things like paladin specs. You will basically never be able to raid as a prot paladin in any guild so dont go paladin with that in mind. Also many good guilds do not accept ret paladins as they do about 1/3rd less damage, or even sometimes half, as much damage as a tier1 dps class. So youre basically stuck with healing as a pally in raids. I can go on and on but basically, since you have no attachments to any class / spec / race yet as youre new to mmo's, i would reccomend going with a minmax combination. That way theres no chance of being dissapointed later on if youve felt like you made a mistake once hitting 60. The only true question would be whether or not you would think you would care for pvp more or pve to decide which race to go with. Class/spec choice should at the very least be minmaxed. However, race is only deciding between pve/pvp. Id personally suggest a rogue or warrior or hunter as those three classes dont have boring pve rotations like caster dps does and healing is a hit or miss playstyle depending on the player. Human/orc melee dps are best for pve. Gnome/dwarf/orc warrior is best for pvp. Gnome/dwarf/undead rogue is best for pvp. If you think you might like healing then the only race specfic thing is for priests as dwarf if you go alliance. Besides that, all other race combinations are mostly minimal unless im forgetting something. If you care more for pvp and not much for pve then your options open up a lot more as rotations and playstyles are way different in that setting.
---
No problem - it's nice to be able to use all those old memories for *something* :-D. "Ras Runs" were a ritual in our guild for quite some time. There *is* a second lab in BWL, but to use that, you have to have defeated the Broodlord. And you need to have alchemists that don't leave their flask ingredients in the bank... Also, you need to have alchemists that *have* those flask recipes (e.g. the Flask of Titans is a comparatively rare drop by Drakkisath, the boss of UBRS; Thankfully, afair, it's not BoP, so you can buy it, but it's gonna be pricey).
---
Development team also followed the route discussed above. Re-releasing content but tweaking it to coincide.
---
Depends what you're wanting as a play style. Warlocks offer a lot of utility in raids and are very effective in 1v1 duels in pvp. However due to the raid debuff limit they're not as effective as they should be and are basically a support shadowbolt spam class. Also good luck doing professions as a lock because you'll have no bag space at all.
---
Mage on the other hand is squishy and very effective at AoE damage and mass control which makes them a bit more viable in wPvP. But there is a good chance there will be a lot of mages so finding a group may be difficult. Also portals and food goes a very long way in vanilla.
---
I'd suggest looking at what you want from a classic experience and how decide where to go from there. Maybe check out some videos and see which class suits you better.
---
And when the game's been out for a while and a lot of "tourists" have migrated elsewhere?
---
How long have you been playing Horde on retail? I've been playing Horde for 10 years now and I've tried switching before. I'm saying tried because I rolled back twice now.
---
THANK ME!
---
If it was badlands, loch modan would have been close enough for some mandatory unending breath utilization. If it was searing gorge he needed the key to make it in time.
---
It won't kill you to play a non-human warrior either. I'm just saying that if you disregard Berserking as not overly substantial, you disregard your whole list.
---
Lol
---
but...but... NO CHANGES.... Seriously now, this is a great idea and I think the best way to approach classic wow. Make the timeline longer, add more content. There is lots of undone, unfinished stuff for vanilla, that might be good idea to look at and release now.
---
Premades dont really use resto shamans so priest would be best if you want to heal.
---
Yeah I had an Undead Warrior alt in Vanilla, but I only got to 40 or so, loved tanking, and smacking the shit out of mobs. But ultimately leveling my mage alt was easier, and would yield better farming.
---
What class + gender combination has the best looking mortal strike (2h-special animation) according to you?
---
Thanks for sharing my vids &lt;3
---
The tbc raids were much much harder though.
---
It would take more time but I would be very happy if they simply redesigned item levels to cap at 60. But that its strength correspond to the difficult in obtaining.
---
Then introduce new content with high difficulties and improve pvp of people want that. Still no reason to introduce TBC classic.
---
Australian players too!
---
"not special needs"
---
Wrong race and spec for shaman.
---
Shaman, druid and hunter.
---
So far I'm leaning towards hunter or shaman. I kinda wanna be a beast in pvp. People say that hunter is the best.
---
Wait and sorry
---
Yeah, Combat Ratings probably make more sense and they're much more in line with how vanilla stats (Strength, Agility, etc) work. 
---
I'm just cautious about deviating from how vanilla "feels" and some players might be alarmed that their vanilla Crit % gear turned into Crit Rating overnight and it might not feel like vanilla to them anymore.
---
All of these changes are tricky because there's going to be a number of people who are in favor and are against of each change. But yeah, Combat Ratings make a lot more sense.
---
Why not just do one, classic and introduce new content with greater difficulty. If the fanbase want arena then give them the opportunity to vote it in into classic. Don't need to release TBC.
---
That's true, I didn't think about that. I'm guessing if it gets bad, GMs can still moderate it somehow, but I'm still optimistic about it regardless.
---
Tauren Male

Droppin the fucking Thunder
---
It absolutely is. If the rp aspect of BS wasnt so damn appealing I would totally choose Alchemy.
---
As a warrior the shield you get from the Trogg chain is worth your time.
---
Wait, what's the bias? People thinking Alliance will be more popular? Cuz I have that feeling for some reason
---
I'm running to them. McConnell and I are going to be friends :)
---
I agree that temporary curiosity is not a sign of success...but you just can't put Classic WoW in the same category with ANY other game.
---
You probably do not understand that Classic WoW, while a curiosity for many, it is also the game that simply revolutionized the MMO gaming in 2005, and it is waited by many others.
---
There is also the Classic vs Retail debate, which is basically OG MMO vs Modern MMO debate...simply because the company that is bringing back the best OG MMO of all times is Blizzard, not some indie company that attempts a NEW game designed like an OLD MMO.
---
You simply cannot just put the label "temporary curiosity" on Classic WoW. It is a much more complex picture.
---
If Classic is successful or not, it will impact the MMO industry, and WoW in particular, forever.
---
Yes, Twitch success of Classic WoW Beta is not an indication for long term success. But private servers are. And those private servers are buggy, having 4-5 times the Vanilla realms population, dynamic respawns, no CDs world world buffs or Black Lotus, and VERY WRONG values for monsters and bosses.
---
STILL, even being much easier than Vanilla, and buggy as hell, and ridden with gold sellers, and corrupt GM's... those private servers had over 1.3 million players in 2015.
---
The VAST majority of WoW players that quit WoW did not went to play on private servers, for obvious reasons. They also did not went to play other MMOs. They just quited because WoW went to shit, and other MMOs were shit to begin with.
---
You, and other people like you, are making the same mistake that Blizzard did : assumed that Classic WoW is an old game, that only a niche of a niche of players would want to play it. Blizzard woke up and realized that Classic WoW will be more popular than modern WoW...this is why they are bringing it back, not because JAB and Ion love the Vanilla players.
---
You, and other people like you, are keep persisting in this. You all guys started with "Vanilla won't come back"..when Blizzard announced it you all said "Classic will fail, it's a waste of resources"...now, when Twitch EXPLODED with viewers watching streamers run low level dungeons in a lvl 30 cap beta, you guys are coming with "Twitch numbers mean nothing", "It's just temporary curiosity", etc.
---
Blizzard realized that Classic is much bigger than they thought. Venruki, Preach, Taliesin, etc., former Classic skeptics or even deniers, after playing Beta are realizing that Classic is THE BETTER game.
---
Worry not, you, and other skeptics like you, will realize, after August 27th, that Classic is the better game...and it will be much more poplar than BfA, not only at launch, but from than onward.
---
Not because of Twitch...but because IT IS THE BETTER GAME.
---
Just want to chime in since I got to play the stress test. 
---
The graphics are great. I was especially impressed that tall grass / flowers move as you walk through them.
---
The irony here is that the OP's build is created and tested on a private server using non-blizzard proc rates for all the key abilities he is using at the core of the spec.
---
PServers have almost 100% JoW/JoL proc rate.  
---
8pcT1 was unknown proc-rate, and it was low.
---
Those only have the amount and not percentage
---
Grats. That was roughly one streamer if I remember correctly. Since I'd the world first races have 15-20. To day it's completely overshadowing retail is just ignorance
---
Anyone else see Sodapoppin complain about alliance not wanting to fight his BIS, max engineering, endless supply of health pots/consumables, fully enchanted, minor run speed increase druid?
---
Previous islands will always become ghost town with the introduction of new continent. Its due to, not really having reason to come back anymore. TBC, no matter how good the expansion was, it was really terribly designed to keep Azeroth relevant. They would have to make major differences or eventually never release TBC as it was back then to keep Azeroth alive.
---
It swung the meta too far the other way.
---
"You hate one shot fiesta? Ok healers are immortal juggernauts and fights with then take an hour"
---
What situations while questing would likely kill a warrior, but most other classes would survive?
---
Priest is the ONLY horde class with a defensive magic dispell if that aids your choice
---
4 silver from a vendor, doesn't fucking matter really if you're 15+...................
---
I like the way you think.
---
Do you think that if Classic turns out to be a success (and here's to hoping it does) it can pave the way for modern game design back towards "our" (let's just handwave this for simplicity) tastes? That despite all the stereotypes about the modern rushing world and new type of audience, we're still a significant amount of paying customers that it's worth creating content for, not just by enthusiast indie developers?
---
When leveling a NE, how much importance would you put on travelling to Ironforge and Stormwind to learn 2 handed swords/axes before you get dual weird at level 20?
---
You can learn staves from Darnassus, but I don’t think there are any quests with a valuable stave reward before then.
---
Retail already exists
---
In general if someone is saying "convince me to not roll this class that I think looks really rad" you should probably just roll that class. 
---
Warlock is perfectly fine in PvP. Amazing duelists. Once they get gear they go from being pretty good to really amazing.
---
Always thought that instead of BE and Drenei it would have a lot more sense to add NAga and Fulborg, without needing to go in space
---
There's no reason for it to be there. As borked as the honor system was in vanilla, you still had the ability to get some very high level gear if you only wanted to PVP, so I don't see a reason to gimp PVE gear on top of that in PVP.
---
Seconded. Although undead female does a flip!
---
I just googled it, and that's what it was in vanilla. That'd be an awfully silly thing for Blizzard to change up. "Hey guys, you can't respec until you've sunk 100 hours into a character!"
---
Why would guilds in tier 3 run raids for worse content.
---
Being able to stay underwater for 10 minutes is pretty big, ye
---
Yes, this. GW did that perfectly. Always think of it when talking about 1.13 content. 
---
Worked perfectly there with the vast horizontal content.
---
same haha... so nice seeing all this stuff again, weird that it's a 3% speed boost to your crappy as basic mount and it's the most awesome thing on the planet... and I really want that trinket again now that I see it.
---
So let PVP suffer. WoW was never created to be this serious PVP game, arena and battle grounds were added as an afterthought.
---
Unfortunately only Gnomes and Dwarves can ride on Mechanostriders.
---

So I did some research on this, perhaps I have been a bit blindsighted, and I found these forum posts:

---
I still stand by what I said: maths is wrong in this case.
---
I love random acts of kindness, I was leveling a warlock on the stress test and a mage opened a trade window that instantly closed as I was running and got out of distance, I assumed it was a mistake until he chased me and opened it again just to trade me 10 water.
---
\#lovemages
---
I guess orc would be better for the stun resist? As for spec, restoration is the only healing spec for shamans. Having a stormstrike spec and running around with heavy wool bandages does little to keep my team mates alive. 
---
If you have any suggestions, then by all means I'm all ears. Have an upvote, buddy!
---
Very well said. We'll see in a few years.
---
Putting Classic WoW in the same category with ANY other game is the first mistake. It's like putting a diamond in a pile of dirt and say that it's all the same.
---
August 27th, 2019 will be a massive wake up call for Blizzard and all other MMO gaming companies. Even bigger than November 23, 2004.
---
Generally when pulling too much mobs. Rogues can stealth/vanish, mages can frost nova and blink away and the other classes can heal themselves.
---
I just replied to u/Beardamus 's comment, I recommend checking that out.
---
I really don't like TBC, it added flying mounts. I'd rather keep Classic max 60 but add more content, new dungeons, new adventures.
---
If you get off on efficiency its really fun. They have no down time. If you like to press a ton of buttons, maybe its not for you. Its mostly just wanding things to death.
---
They're very fast efficient levelers.
---
Half out of 6-7 million is still much larger than ANY other MMO in existence today.
---
Totally agrer
---
&gt; I am planning to be one of those who leaves after a while 
---
Your plan will fail.
---
Couldn't agree more. Been a horde player from vanilla to Wod. Tried alliance on a private server last year and i just fell in love with the faction. Never going back.
---
39 was always my favorite. Still no mounts, which I find gives WSG a more strategic feel. More specs open up with level 30 talents and abilities, like Balance Druids and Elemental Shaman. The classes are also fairly even, with some obvious outliers, but nothing crazy like the power gap between 29 hunters and everyone else. It's a really fun bracket and one I hope to rejoin.
---
There's already been changes so that movements lost
---
You can visualize the animations [here](https://classic.wowhead.com/dressing-room)
---
Not sure if sarcasm.
---
Not if you make it competitive. A race for placement,
---
You do go Shadow. You can heal every 5-man dungeon regardless of spec; this goes for every healer in the game. It also goes for tanks not needing to be Prot or Feral spec.
---
You can either go all the way to 60 as Shadow or swap to a Holy spec somewhere in your late 50's. I usually do this to orient myself to the new spec and spells. Obviously this only makes since if you plan on being a healer in PvE content. Otherwise just stay Shadow.
---
It should make a difference though because the tanks are going to do less damage and to take less threat. And the less your tank has threat, the less the DPS' can burst down the boss without taking aggro. Higher Parry and Dodge basically lowers the DPS cap due to the tank having to keep aggro.
---
I thought it was a good read.
---
But, J. Allen Brack was the original announcer for WoW classic back at blizzcon 2017. So at this point he’s probably changed his mind. Remember, he made that comment like 4-5 years ago at this point, during Warlords.
---
Lol, i didn't even think of that. It would be crazy
---
That's awesome. Didn't realize. Thanks!
---
I'll mainly wzbt to play PVP. I also want to play a healer as it is the role I enjoy the most playing.
---
I would also prefer a class that is pretty good in terms of solo play.
---
I will check his stuff out.
---
Can i play on EU servers from NA and vice versa? Will i have any ping related problems?
---
Everyone has been waiting to see it again... wtb classic beta invite already:(
---
I think they should just recreate Azeroth, set 300 years in the past or something with a brand new engine. Take the overall philosophy and social aspects of Classic and combine it with the class and dungeon design of TBC.
---
Because it's an MMO, and if you wanted to perform you had to be good in both aspect of the game, this just splitted the game in 2.
---
You could litterraly be fully epic geared for pvp just by interracting with one player, to me it's where wow started to be a fastfood mmo, After this LFR was the nxt logic thing to do and we know what it brought...
---
In addition the arena gear was way too easy to obtain, especially when they started to sell previous version for honor.
---
&gt; Back in actual classic some 80% of players quit before they reached level 60. 
---
Yeah, but those people wer stupid, they didn't even knew what they are doing...right? But the gamer today is much more better, skilled and informed...right?
---
If the above is true (which seems to be a mantra these days), the reasons people quit in Vanilla back in the day (being stupid and not knowing what they do) no longer exists.
---
So...the dropout in Classic will be much lower than 80%, probably around 40%, if not less...but it will recover most of it, and gain some more in the first 6 months.
---
Just because it's the SUPERIOR product.
---
:) same applies for name reservation- forget if it's the 13th global or not but think so and would be 12th for NA aswell
---
I'm not too concerned about efficiency. As long as  it isn't a significant waste of time, I'm gonna check it out. Thanks
---
Alt for sure. You're going to eventually want at least one alt. Everyone at the very least makes a bank alt. 
---
If you 100% have no plans on leveling a 2nd character to 60, I recommend leveling a Rogue with your friend. Sprint is BiS for bank alts :)
---
Great to hear that you discovered the joy of not knowing where the hell you're going. The quest journal and map being combined on retail is one of my biggest peeves.
---
Wait, isn't Daily Mail a right wing publication?
---
His  thoughts about giving Classic WoW its own 'expansions' or 'content'  after Naxxramas is interesting. I however feel like, if you were to give  Classic WoW it's own path and not make it run like retail did, you need  to embrace the fact that it isn't #NoChanges anymore, and you have to  change some of the biggest flaws of Vanilla/Classic WoW.
---
There's  absolutely no way the class balance in Vanilla is acceptable or the  fact that most Classes only have 1 spec which is decent or considered  viable. Imagine having Warriors/Rogues doing twice the DPS of some of  the worst specs out there in PvE at Naxxramas level and now you start  further increasing the gap, by releasing post-Naxxramas content.
---
I'm  not saying the #NoChanges movement is bad. But if you start  acknowledging the fact that Classic WoW can be better, by doing  post-Naxxramas content, you absolutely need to acknowledge that Class  Balance is a must as well.
---
In short: If you're going to ditch the #NoChanges movement down the road, you might  as well balance the most unbalanced stuff. Some kind of balance change  ala TBC, where everything is viable, not the same and does more/less DPS  than others, but all within the threshold of being acceptable. In both  PvP and PvE.
---
Human - Mage then. All Priest on allies must be Dwarf, unless you are Star Sharding Nightelf for the luls.
---
For pserver comparison only: naked level 1 Dwarf Warrior - what's the health regen?
---
I'd like to see Classic being successfull and if so, i really dont know what i personally would like to see. Even if they would redo BC with the Vanilla mindset and soul and everything, or any other expansion, once they add more and more landscape to explore - Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdom will feel once again like a ghost town to be a bit over dramatic. 
---
Even if they somehow made old content still viable, people will be scattered all over the place. It will just not be the same if you have x amount of players on a landscape like classic, or have them on a wider landscape. Content may be rewarding, challenging, fun with vanilla principles but the community and the world itself will not be the same. Thats how i feel.
---
The hype of getting bags never really get old. I've levelled so many characters in private servers and it's banger every time
---
I was kinda joking but yes PvP sometimes gave you the impression of hitting so weakly that it was sometimes frustrating and feeling like you were less powerful than before.
---
And yes running around pillars was a problem of Arenas but... well world pvp with flying mounts was getting rare and BG had become a joke so it was the most important part even if you didn't really liked it.
---
Buffing is part of the reason I fell in love with MMORPGs back in the day. In classic I already caught myself buffing people with a certain zeal. Even pets can't escape. I will often not leave a quest hub or village until everything that stands, walks and crawls is buffed =P
---
Karazhan in classic would be so dope. I think it might be the best raid they've ever made. I was sick to death and hated running it in TBC at the end because i'd run it 100's of times, i mean every alt you made the first step was to get into Karazhan.
---
But the instance is really just fantastic.
---
Only when I'm raiding the place
---
We're talking about gear though, not how well your character is versed at dealing with certain encounters. A piece of armor being hoarded away by a dragon shouldn't necessarily protect you from dragons more than humans or elves.
---
So if we're talking about realism, a piece of armor shouldn't protect you better from a human-controlled character than a computer-controlled character. I understand that there are some mechanical differences between PvP and PvE for the sake of balance, but Resilience is just a really obvious immersion-breaking "this is PvP gear" stat, which IMO shouldn't be in a fantasy game.
---
Because if they do TBC they'll eventually do WotLK, which is what I actually want.
---
If you can't beat them, join them. Also: traitor.
---
You going to get downvoted here if you mention private servers
---
learn to downrank your spells, only pull out the big guns on boss fights. Learn to have mana pots and have food buffs which regen your mana, even as low level. 
---
Leveling cooking &amp; fishing as you level is great for this.
---
Boomers expecting people to communicate and spend ages conversing over joining a dungeon or raid group when the reality is people will be like "frost mage, 64 ilvl inv" :)
---
Shockadin here. Pally is boring as fuck to level. But you will never have to worry about dying. On pve we are healers/supports. Keep the tank alive and keep your buffs on your mates. Also adjust the aura to the enemy. On pvp we are defensive supports. You are supposed to buff, clean your teammates debuffs and secure kills with your stun. Once you have a bit of gear you will also be able to burst one enemy down, but it will be very mana costly so you should only use it to take down important enemies like hunters or rogues who are harassing your team healers.
---
You could also go holy Reckoning, but in my opinion that build is very boring. 
---
You should check an elemental shaman. Is like pally but more offensive oriented. You use totems to cc your enemies and burst them down with lightning bolt and chain and at the same time you keep your team alive. Also that 40% speed is very sweet.
---
If it means Blood Elves never get to be a playable race, I can live with this. Otherwise just give me TBC with all its flaws lol
---
Holy fucking shit it's weird to see this picture. Although bear in mind this was a private server and not 2006 vanilla.
---
It was a guild called "The Kor Kron" lead by a guy called Vorosh (who you can see in the picture). 
---
I'm not in this screenshot, because I'm further behind trying to protect our backside.
---
We did hundreds of raids like this- it was almost every day. The population of the guild became so big that four separate guilds were made. (which is the reason you can see Specialists, Vanguard, etc)
---
It may be time to jump off the BFA ship. In fact, I'd say you're a little late if you haven't done it yet

You started in Wrath but are 17? So you was what 6?.. Sure mate
---
The only way to match this, would be Fury Prot Tank, i.e. dualwield. And that's not possible in pre bis.
---
That's what I was thinking too. I know Westfall won't cover a full 10-20 experience, so I don't think I'll be wasting too much time. Plus, I can grab the Wetlands FP before finishing up and heading south.
---
I'm not sure I agree that the game itself is responsible. The game has changed because people have changed. You can see it throughout society by now, and certainly throughout the Internet. The whole world is running retail.

Buffing pets &gt; buffing the player. Change my mind
---
True, still Kael and Sylvanas would probably be compatible, but she would never join illidan. I miss the time when warcraft wasn't sci-fi
---
Indeed some Pve (weapon for example) were still a must for PvP but it still created the feeling that most of the stuff you got in raid was only useful... for raiding. (which again can be seen as a positive and negative)
---
But I'm no expert in PvP in BC, I think I died watching two resto druids fighting 1vs1 for 3 hours at some point and stopped for ever.
---
I think the stress test servers where in US only and some of us had 120ms of ping which is playable (specially if you know how to cancel your cast). But the experience would be MUCH better with a reasonable ping.

Blizzard knows the solution to preventing this as does everyone else. The "playerbase" doesnt want to actually solve these problems. ESEA created an intrusive spyware to greatly prevent this type of thing from happening but the players got mad. 
---
Unless your willing to accept intrusive spyware from blizzard or any third party company you will never actually do anything about hackers and cheaters
---
Is it really so hard to level a warrior? Why is it so slow compared to a rogue?
---
Played other mmos with hc perma death mode with full item drops on death, it can be done for sure but would require a bit tuning. Other mmos like this have gone with increased exp. and item drops.
---
Sometimes just to pass tge time I used to place my mage at hotspots around low level zones, like the starting spawn in Elwyn Forrest, the south side of Goldshire or around tge bridge leading to Westfall, and I would just deal out Arcane Intelligect buffs to low level players passing by on their way to quests.
---
I felt like a WoW version of Oprah: "*You get AI! You get AI!!! YOU GET AI!!! EVERBODY GETS AI!!!*"
---
Looking forward to doing stuff like that again.
---
And people were banned for it. Why would you not fix something when you ban people for using it?
---
Other than world PvP, I doubt streamers would have a real impact on a server. If you Pve, it is just like any other big guild.
---
This many patches brings up the issue what modern WoW has: useless areas and play the patch mentality.
---
I have suggested a couple of times in this sub, that maybe they add seasons and seasonal servers (similar in Path of Exile or Diablo) where people race whatever goal they have in mind. 1st to 60, 1st to rank 14, 1st to MC etc. Could be fun. Blizz could also add some twists each seasonal event to spice things up.
---
In all honestly I think Blizz will eventually roll out TBC and Wrath. The code and models and everything already exist so it'll be easier (see: cheaper) for them to put out than literally new content. :(
---
KILLING EVERYONE INSIDE.
---
How hard will be for me to gear up? (arms pvp focus). Playing with 2 friends (druid and rogue), no clan, decent/good amount of time to waste. Should i make a mage to farm?
---
So how do you as a warrior solve situations where you would agro 3-4 mobs? Kill one, die, repeat?
---
Chuck Norris thinks he does and he does

Mage is like easy mode warlock
---
I think this needs a little context - I was a CPA working in public accounting. The longer you tough it out with the shitty hours/pay there the better job you end up getting when you ultimately make the move out.

Typically people stick around there for 2-4 years for experience, I did 3 before I called it quits, but had the goal of doing 6.
---
This is my single biggest fear with post-naxx updates, the power creep may be too much...
---
I LOVE the idea of adding alternative levelling zones/dungeons, 50-60 were a bit dry and could do with some competition or decent hubs.
---
I like the idea of adding max level or 58-60 zones as it provides more areas to farm some money, hks and potentially opens up some interesting routes to add attunement quest lines
---
With regards power creep, I think there could be just alternative stat weightings around the naxx power level which open up other specs or allowing more interesting hybrid specs, for example;
---
1. Instead of +20 frost or +20 fire, have +12 frost AND +12 fire for mages, enabling elemental mages.
---
2. Provide gear with pure spell power instead of any stamina for casters, allowing glass cannons or massive heals
---
This is purely off the cuff, but I'd love to see how power creep could be mitigated
---
We got a few streamers, but nothing close to the size of the US streamers in both numbers of followers and pure craze of said followers.
---
Feel free to do it but you will get banned for it just like in Vanilla. You really think GMs just let people do shit like this? Hell, you could get suspensions just for attacking people from the roofs of the buildings in silithus, and everybody could see how to get up there.
---
huh? Neither OP, nor the guy you replied to said anything about wanting TBC. It's about new content that stays in line with what vanilla was, just reusing assets that existed in later expansions.
---
Why is that?
---
I don't believe it's possible to get it just from questing until the repeatable cloth turn-ins are enabled. There simply aren't that many Gnomeregan faction quests in the game, unfortunately. Gnomes and MAYBE Dwarves or Humans could do it IIRC (Dwarves start with a bonus to Gnome rep, and Humans get increased rep gain with all factions.)
---
However, there aren't really any reasons to get Exalted with Gnomeregan as a Human or Night Elf, since only Gnomes and Dwarves can ride Mechanostriders.
---
A ton of bad answers in this thread, people seem to be pretty much entirely wrong so far.

The reason resilience sucked is because the implementation punished bursty classes more than dots/consistent damage. This was further exasperated by the fact that the burstier classes tended to struggle in the arena format anyway, not being able to deal with pillars. Specs that relied on big bursty crits were ruined while warlock and shadow priest were pretty much untouched. Frost mage was the only real viable nuke caster pretty much for this reason. Shatter intrinsically made their crit so high that resilience didn't affect them all that much AND they had the control required to keep people in their line of sight. 
---
People who claim their pvp gear turned them into a god are just mis-remembering. High end pvpers pretty much used as much pve gear as they could possibly get away with with little exception. 
---
Resilience also did virtually nothing to kill world pvp, that can be attributed pretty much entirely to flying mounts as evidenced by the massive world pvp hub on the isle with no flying.
---
You are welcome.
---
See? Horde sucks.
---
That's a good one
---
But what advantage is there to be gained on a beta server? The more people exploit this now, the better chance Blizzard will patch this out when we hit live. 
---
Also, a point not directed at you at all, but this kind of exploits should not have a home in Classic in my opinion, even if it was in Vanilla.
---
Oof my arms
---
At least whisper a thank you to them, as a priest I enjoy it when I buff people and they say thank you this makes me happy :)
---
Chuck Norris has tears that cure vaccine complications... Too bad he never cries... Ever.
---
Look once sharding is done and the game has settled we can have loads of shenanigans
---
Less threat means more overall dps, Windfury only increases melee dps, Salvation increases dps on casters hunters &amp; melee alike
---
Rage management, CD on Charge and/or Bloodrage.
---
The soda clip that played immediately after is hilarious.
---
It does have impact, though you wouldn't realize it right away. It would automatically have a much higher population than the standard server and in that regard, it could also have the snowball effect of people snowballing into those servers just because it has more people. It takes very little for people to gain an impression and then stick with it. Community perception is a scary thing.
---
&gt; It is an increase of 250% 
---
Just a little correction ; it's an increase of 150% actually, not 250%. Multiplying something by 2 means increasing its value by 100%, not 200%. 
---
Getting from 5.6% to 14% parry is multiplying the parry value by 2.5, hence increasing it by 150% (14 = (5.6 + 1x5.6 + 0,5x5.6) = (5.6 + 150%x5.6)).
---
&gt; Healers in Classic will HATE healing a Druid tank in raids 
---
Actually a Bear Druid would be more loved by healers than a prot warrior in that situation, because lower attack speed = less spiky boss burst. The problem with bears won't be with healers, but with getting aggro at the beginning of the fight I believe, and keeping it if 3 or 4 bears attacks are parried/Missed/dodged in a row. Then there's the topic of crushing blows due to Druids lacking the +defence gear, but that's also a problem on PServers, which is unaffected by this new info.
---
It's strange how Blizzard pushes class fantasy now, but visually you can't tell what class someone is fucking playing half the time unless they have a spell effect or something around them. All armor in modern WoW seems to look like plate now.
---
* Chuck Norris can resurrect the Spirit Healer.
---
* Chuck Norris can tame druids.
---
* If Chuck Norris stays at a dragons tail, he won't get kicked away. The dragon will.
---
* Chuck Norris doesn't need items. The items need Chuck Norris.
---
* Chuck Norris doesn't need drop luck, he decides what drops... and by whom.
---
Yeah, that's all and really bad.
---
This is excellent.
---
Found a few mobs spawning underground that I reported during the stress test. Think one was a Scarlet Crusade Warrior outside of Undercity/Brill.
---
To be honest, at the start on a Fresh realm, I'm going to be vendoring most stuff. I'm taking skinning and a gathering prof, as its fairly straight forward. I'll vendor all trash from skinning up to Medium leather. Then my plan is to hold it all till I get to level 40, and see where my cash is regards getting my mount.  At level 40, I'll look to see whether its worth AHing the leather or not.  
---
Same with Gathering, I'll send all to a bank alt, either herbing or mining. mining is easier to level as you cam smelt the ore you mine for good skill ups too. Also, running the deadmines / Wailing Caverns / RFC, can net you a good level of ore too, so you can easily reset the instances and go again.  
---
The issue initially will be the abundance of players and folk leveling professions. You're right in that you will not do well just trying to farm nodes or spawn points, but just questing will take you near nodes. I also think the spawn timers will he high initially. 
---
Skinning make so much sense as you have to kill so many mobs which are skinnable. Even just picking up your own skins will be profitable. 
---
For Blues and good twink greens, again, I'll send them to a bank alt to hold till I reach 60 and maybe need the gold....and hopefully the economy has started to grow by then.
---
1. Class balance. Are paladins shit tanks forever? As soon as you start creating new content long term people expect classes to change which impacts every other system.
---
1. Vertical progression is a core part of the game that focuses guilds on getting to the next raid tier but expansion gear resets were necessary so everyone didn't get spread too thin on the chain of raid tiers. Gear resets have always been a necessary part of this system to reset power progression and reduce player secondary stats. I personally prefer horizontal progression but when you've got 4 raid tiers at the same power level as Naxx it's going to create player motivation problems for guilds. Power progression is so deeply rooted in WoW and the playerbase mindset.
---
1. People want different things. Classic is simple because pretty much everyone accepts that 1.12 is the system foundation. As soon as you go from a design paradigm of replicating what was to a paradigm of what it should be you are going to end up with huge amounts of disagreement.
---
Based on this I don't believe they are going to create new content for vanilla because there are so many design problems. It's much easier to just release TBC and then WOTLK servers.
---
I was on my way to kill Bolvar in Orgrimmar. :D
---
Does this mean you can eat/drink in stealth too? Or does that happen for a different reason?
---
I don't see where he says anything about redoing TBC. All he says is to reuse assets and art from TBC to make new content. I'd say that's pretty open for interpretation as to what that actually means (probably deliberately).
---
Imo, new classic content should never make is go to a new continent that is seperate to the old world. New content should always be connected or ideally integrated somehow. So add a new zone here and there, add new content in existing zones. E.g. a mining operation by the venture co. goes awry and they dug up some old evil or w/e. BAM new max level dungeon/raid
---
Because of the PvE oriented racials on alliance side.
---
Self casts only trigger the animation immidiatly. The server batches that data still like anything else.
---
I thought about this too. My main in Vanilla was a hunter, and I raided right up till cata was released. I played casually for a while, but stopped after that. I leveled many alts, and was playing my shammy more and more in tbc and Wrath.  I loved the BGs as a shammy. 
---
But my hunter was so good for making gold, really easy. 
---
I want to level a shammy as my main this time, but worried about the ability to farm, so might go hunter 1st, then level the shammy.
---
I was a geared out PVE player that switched to PVP at the end of vanilla.  I was indeed very dangerous for the typical PVP player, with my AQ40 level gear , but the pvp player would have more skill in 1 vs 1 play.   The problem started when we as PVE players went in groups, we could almost 'act' like it was PVE, with tanks, healers and controllers, and the enemy was just a bit smarter than the normal pve bosses, but our combined firepower would overpower them. Only the best pvp premades could stop that.
---
Streamers bring more people.
---
More people bring up the price of things. 
---
If / WHEN the streamer quits, a large portion is going to quit as well, could end up in screwing with the H / A ratio, market can crash, guilds can die down etc. 
---
Lots of people join streamer servers, get geared through other guilds &gt; hope to join streamer guild.
---
I'm surprised that Ulduar is in that list, what appearance does it have in vanilla?
---
Sorry to be dumb but what is this meme about? Did a Dev claim the fans of WoW don't know what's good for the game or something? 
---
Can someone please clarify this for me
---
You’re joking right? Streamers are offered handouts all the time. Just not everyone takes them.
---
The crowd resembles an upvote arrow.
---
I do not know why people are doing this. Why does anyone care who is or is not autistic? I do not think it is just a Gen Z thing, as I first heard it being used this way by millennials (the demographic I belong to) a few years ago. Maybe it is supposed to be funny? I have no idea. 
---
Who wants to play "which condition will the internet demonize next"?
---
Hahaha wtf is this
---
We don't know. Maybe the blue post was right but it changed on later patches or maybe the blue post was vs players only and not vs mobs and they failed to mention.
---
I’m not playing alliance scum so the only time I will see these gates is when the will of the horde brings them down
---
I played on the stress test servers from EU and barely noticed the ping. Its totally fine imo.
---
They don't want people 10 maning dungeon content. You don't want to 10 man this content either, with the exception of UBRS of course.
---
Never got into RS but interested to why they handled the OSRS situation so well ?
---
Honestly curious why you think that.
---
Thete are many things to not like about retail WoW, I just never saw ability and spell design as one of them.
---
Feel like thats one of the few things keeping the game enjoyable, is being able to use things like Shroud of Concealment in interresting ways.
---
I posted something tangible that got downvoted for whatever reason. Maybe that's where the concrete ideas disappear to.
---
yeah and on beta he messes up with players a lot
---
God, this circle jerk again.
---
Listen, it's basically a new game to a lot of people at this point. It's an oddity, at a time when content is rather slow on WoW. PTR content doesn't tend to draw a huge crowd. He wasn't entirely wrong with his statement: a lot of people who want it will play it for a little and quit. You see that data bear out in private servers that share their data.
---
The correct answer to that argument was always 'well some people want it and it's important to preserve the games roots in some form from a gaming history standpoint'. And here we are now. I'd be willing to bet long term Classics numbers draw less players than retail on a year to year basis (Classic will probably peak at times like right now, when people have cleared the current tier). As strange as it is, without the catch-up system of gear Classics endgame is very modular and evergreen, which will help facilitate a pick-up and play attitude towards raiding.
---
But let's not pretend that a game riding on a wave of hype is going to maintain that hype forever. It dies off. Fairly quickly.
---
&gt;Don't nerf previous content, don't accelerate leveling speed, don't raise the level cap past 60
---
That doesn't change anything. MMO playerbases become top heavy in level distribution because few new players join after the initial rush. None of what you proposed would change that.
---
Casuals always existed, it's just that there were no games made for them.
---
Ironically, the first really casual MMORPG was WoW.
---
Make an alt, and wait for a fresh server to start over. Or get bored and quit.

Here's a video of Duskwood, couple hours into night:
---
 [https://youtu.be/qTKFh-G90iQ?t=8283](https://youtu.be/qTKFh-G90iQ?t=8283)
---
No problem ^_^
---
No, not tough at all. You pet becomes your buddy. Most pets can eat a lot of stuff, so if you are leveling cooking/fishing, then it doesnt cost a lot. 
---
The main issue in vanilla was the pet abilities. You had to tame other pets to learn new abilities and higher ranked abilities. So this was a bit of a pain, having to stable your main pet, to go tame a new one for the ability you wanted. Then running back to get your main pet to learn it. 
---
I usually went for a tanking pet (like a Gorilla for thunderstomp or a turtle for shieldshell) , a Cat (like Brokentooth for PVP for the spell push back), and either a wolf for furious howl, or a wing serpant for lightening shield for raiding.
---
&gt;Warrior takes long time to level as solo
---
&gt;Takes Paladin instead
---
Uhmm..
---
Because they’re streamers
---
Paladin isn't much faster/easier than warrior. It's an auto-attack simulator that might even prove to be worse (more time consuming and overall inefficient)  if you're at least experienced as a warrior in classic.
---
Did you play warcraft 3? Kael'thas goes to outland with the Naga and they save the Drainei villiage and meet Akama. It is a pretty big mission and they are allied at the end.
---
YES
---
If the tanks cannot get the rage to dump the threat abilities the DPS cannot pump out the numbers.
---
I think you'll see answers like "horizontal progression" and so forth. There's been very few examples of what that actually *is* however.
---
There's probably a real answer in there which is not tied to gear, but an initial idea is along the lines of:
---
1. After completing certain content, grant additional talent points.
---
2. Other content might contain spellbooks with some TBC spells (like the pally single-target taunt, was it Avenging Shield?)
---
3. Ability to unlock talent tree progression above the 30-point talent tree.
---
4. Crafted recipes with better itemization available as drops.
---
Now, granted, that would have to move class balance (on the baseline) more toward TBC. But I don't think any of us really had a problem with class balance in that expansion; the problem lay with flying mounts, level 70 stat creep, or ultra-godmode advancement.
---
That's just off the top of my head. I'm sure an actual game designer could be a lot more inventive with "horizontal progression" while keeping the original Vanilla intact.
---
Careful this is a damned god dam
---
As long as we get rated BGs as well.
---
Nuke Shattrath and make outlands a 40-60 leveling area with a few dungeons and raids while never making anything above AQ40 level.
---
okay, I got you :)
---
I'm just glad to see it so close. Hopefully that bodes well for actual server populations. We need balance on those world pvp fights yo!
---
Did someone say ANAL [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]!?
---
Glad you liked it. I'll be probably rolling in an RP-PvP server
---
&gt;Original WoW didn't show the health of enemies
---
This is only true for pve
---
Priests are the main pvp healers for horde. so play that. each premade run at least two priests. and priest always do most of the healing on horde.
---
One shaman is brought for totems (sometimes in elem+restor mix so then you arent much of a healer even). and overall is a lesser healer and more of utility+healing. when priests are the main healers on the horde side. 
---
also troll shaman is kinda shitty as a race+class combo. so ya i'd recommend you to pick a priest.
---
Chuck Norris played wow once. The results of the servers not being able to contain his power have become known as Maintenance Tuesdays
---
Yeah, I'm a relatively new player. So I actually never know where to go next. I use Joana's guide to roughly know where to go. I don't skip quests and don't intend to level up fast. I really enjoy exploring everything and making friends along the way.
---
I doubt anyone would mind the new talents and spells from TBC tho, it made a lot more specs playable.
---
Also, if more endgame content gets released, then uneven gear scaling would become a large issue needing to get addressed. All in all, simply extending Classic comes with its own set of problems and threads into uncharted waters.
---
Countries that get their own servers have it even better. I'll be playing on a German server and I don't think that we have even one streamer that is big enough to have an impact on the server.
---
Paladin salvation blessing
---
I believe that, while yes BGs will be cross-realm, they'll be 3-5 realm "battle group" as before.
---
Because power creep. Eventually people with the highest tier gear will just mow down everything in their path. This is why they added Resilience in TBC. If they keep adding new raids and better gear eventually we might see people soloing or duoing MC. Is that vanilla?
---
As usual, no, because it would have ripple effects on the rest of the game. a BoP Blacksmithing item is now BiS? That's less people running a specific dungeon for that specific item, meaning other classes may find it harder to find a group for that dungeon, more people taking up mining/smithing, which means more node competition, inflated AH prices on mats for that item, etc, etc. Any change, no matter how small you think it might be, can have bigger consequences down the line.
---
Yeah, it's fucking crazy that Blizzard hates Alliance so much. They can't level Engineering, use pots and enchants or farm the same gear as him, shit's unfair.
---
No. But if people didnt provide them the software in the first place there wouldnt be a need to counter measures. It doesnt matter if others would do it if you didnt, that is a very poor excuse.
---
No, Blizzard should not start to rebalance parts of classic. #nochanges
---
\#NoChanges
---
I agree. I'm not a fan of sharding, or layering.
---
But I started playing like 10 days before TBC launch. I never saw a lot of people in those 10 days. I bought TBC when it came out, because I wanted to reroll as a Draenei.
---
The Draenei starting area was just unplayable. This was before you could get credit for a quest mob without being the first to tag it. So there were no mobs at all, there were only hundreds of Draenei camping the spawn points.
---
Classic is something Blizzard is trying to present as a good thing. If they don't shard or layer their zones in the first few weeks, it will be unplayable. Even with layering, there will be a queue for certain mobs.
---
You don't use Outlands. You use BC assets on Azeroth.
---
Maybe there's still some guilds struggling with BWL/AQ/Naxx that would get mileage out of this new content.
---
Maybe that content has gear that makes offspecs like Balance Druid or Prot Paladin or Elemental Shaman better.
---
Maybe the content is linked to long class quests for legendary items.
---
Maybe there's some new clickies with some useful applications.
---
Maybe the gear is similar to current tier gear but you prefer the look of the new sets.
---
Remember, guilds still ran MC all throughout vanilla for stuff like Thunderfury, Onslaught Girdle, etc.
---
Rogue is also really slow. But rogues has vanish/sprint/evasion.
---
I want to do hunter but because of the low dps output and limited utility I'm afraid that I wouldn't get a raid spot. 
---
And I really want to raid a few days a week haha.
---
I’m the same as you. Affliction was my thing back then and even now. I think I am going Shadow Priest this round though as there seems to be so many people playing Warlock this time around
---
Couldn't disagree more
---
Tailoring : robe of power (lvl33) - spidersilk boots (lvl28) - enchanters cowl (lvl28) - dreamweave pieces (~lvl40).
---
few examples of the top of my head of some really good low level crafts, heck most of the green crafts are good if you keep your tailoring high enough to craft them.
---
http://classicdb.ch/?spells=11.197#100+7+1
---
Sounds good to me. Especially if we get new raids with TBC levels of difficulty. Supplementing the existing Vanilla raids with some 25 man raids would be a good move too, since getting a regular group of raiders large enough to consistently run 40 mans can be tough - especially on less populated servers.
---
Lol he actually tried to raid deadmines.
---
reported
---
Great, but nobody will give a shit about them unless they increase level cap. If they increase level cap, it’s not vanilla anymore.
---
Hakkars Corrupted Blood almost killed everyone...
---
But Chuck Norris doesn't bleed.
---
Thanks. 
---
Perhaps it's premature to be talking about expansions and the requisite changes. Folks will probably be more open to letting the creative juices flow after August 27th.
---
&gt;there are actually more shards created for that area then there are servers
---
...you mean "more shards than realms", right? Otherwise it wouldn't make much sense to "shard" (creating a virtual server), since it'd still compete for the same server resources rather than being able to be offloaded to a different server/cluster?
---
(I also quit a long time ago, like around launch of BC and have only occasionally reactivated my account, so I'm really only making an educated guess here)
---
Ah how the tables have turned darkness
---
I said most. 4-5 pieces isnt a lot for 300 skill levels.
---
When I saw the male paladin in the cinematic of TBC, I thought that they looked awesome. Strong and intelligent.
---
In original wow, the spells had a sub-timing in the batch.  A typical example is Lay on Hands going on cooldown and the person dying (I have experienced this).  
---
This happens because even though the batch happens, the death happens before the spell in the same batch.  You can have the reverse effect, but it just looks like a normal heal.
---
Sometime in Cata I want to say, they gave spells a priority list inside the same batch, under the assumption that the batches were small enough that a priority made sense.  Since then, Death+LoH will always land in favor of LoH.
---
I suspect this Cata+ functionality is still in the Classic Beta based on my tests with other cata+ systems, but I was not able to come up with any reasonable test since I only have stress test access.
---
I'm not saying it should be better, I'm saying it should be equal.
---
What about the people who want TBC? What about the people who want to keep vanilla as it was, without newly added shit that was never in the game?
---
This is why I would save those spirit scrolls. Would cast it on them as a thank you lol.
---
Yeah you do, AV afk farm was a thing for a lot of time. Not saying that we should do it, just that this is normal.
---
As a warrior main from Vanilla to BFA, I know your pain.
---
Tauren, HP Regen is not needed for raiding. Maybe its useful to level but after this its totally worthless.
---
Tauren is just Superior, Warstomp, % HP
---
But you can consider taking a Orc, 25% Stun resist.
---
Tarren with noggerfogger
---
Shoot from max distance, the initial mob you shot will keep agro on you longer than the other mobs.
---
You run away until the other mobs evade and run back leaving you with your initial target.
---
You will be doing this a lot!
---
I have only tried Shadow as this was my first priest to level, but you do make some very good points, and if I have time before Classic launches I’ll probably level another priest (or at least attempt to) to see how Holy is.
---
I played Warcraft 3 and TFT a shitton, which part of "Draenei are not part of Azeroth" did you not get? : P Draenei literally live in the Outland, why would they be present on another planet? It makes no sense at all.
---
counting
---
I envy you big time buddy
---
I know that feeling bro :)
---
Might be talking about Uldum in Tanaris which is basically just a big door guarded by giants
---
Tauren, but if you want to pvp orc is best best for pvp. Tauren is best tank without question.
---
Top guilds will use troll, for the extra aggro
---
#nochanges
---
4-5 pieces was an example, there is loads more
---
I'm hoping with every fiber that Classic does well enough to justify giving the Classic team more resources to work with.
---

---
&gt;invite me to pentagram layer

Jesus christ I felt a jolt of pain reading that. Are they gonna fix this shit?

You'll want something with Nature's Grasp and Natural Shapeshifter.

Troll would be the best MT.

---
Can you make a TL:DR for your posts? I want to read them but they're too long and I have lootboxes to get. Thanks in advance.
---
It's very real. 
---
There was a recent thread proposing guild banks in which a commenter pointed to layering, colorblind mode, and other changes as reasons to go ahead and implement guild banks. Y'know, since they're making some changes anyway...
---
Slippery slopes, man. They're slippery because they're so easy to fall into.
---
It hurt my heart. One server one layer why are they doing this shit??
---
Hey! I was there too! It sucked how much we got disconnected, at one point we almost got it but alas the devs like Alliance more. Once we heard about Bolvar in Thrall’s room it was over.
---
And even then the german streamers i know play on regular eu realms
---
‘Jeremy corbyn uses pentagram to summon more immigrants to the UK?’
---
Better spread out and take your nature prot pot
---
Not true. You can play the content for 1 hour and then go farm the Invincible mount that doesn't fucking exist for 15 hours the rest of the day.
---
Troll racials are better.
---
&gt; Most bosses have 25% more armor.
---
Incorrect. At least on the major pservers, boss armor was identical to the vanilladb values. If anything, these may underestimated because that database was created from nerfed database leaks.
---
Randomly buffing bosses is something only a couple of marginal pservers have tried.
---
For top progression guilds, they will use troll for the additional threat.
---
For casual guilds I could see Tauren being superior for the higher health percentage and less world buffs making agro less of a concern. 
---
Orcs 25% stun resist is also a notable mention (but is a huge detriment on any fight with MC if the tank gets controlled and blood fury used)
---
Warlocks beat mages in duels every time, make of that what you will
---
I don't get why people complain so much about heroic dungeons. 
---
They were more difficult than any vanilla content up to Nefarian (Mechanically, I realize getting 30+ people organized is difficult, at times).
---
Most of the dungeon gear was replaced super quickly by raid or pvp gear. The only difference to dungeon loot in vanilla is the actual color of the item.
---
Sure, flying and shattrath were bad ideas but that's about it, imo.
---
this is highly highly wrong
---
Just like vanilla was, ah the memories
---
If you aggro 3-4 mobs, you're probably dead. You have to pull with a ranged weapon to try to pull one, maybe two at most. You have the AOE fear but that always runs the risk of pulling additional mobs.
---
really, why is INTJ seen as superior? I got INFJ from the test and reading through the further (free) material, I'd say it is mostly fitting. And reading it, I felt like INFJ is a pretty good result as in: it has lots of positive attributes that I think people should aspire to, like being passionate and being altruistic.
---
I just skimmed over the INTJ Strengths and weaknesses, too. Most of them fit my personality pretty well, too. But that's not too surprising as INTJ and INFJ should be rather similar by definition, especially if you are close to 50/50 F/T ... Anyways, none of these tests are binary. It's all on a spectrum and are essentially meaningless to anyone else but yourself. And lying to yourself by pretending to be on a particular position on a spectrum makes no sense at all.
---
Why are you so jaded about adding in TBC? If people want TBC give them TBC, if you don't want to play it. Don't. Like this is the same argument people used for classic. 'You don't need classic if we have retail' mentality.
---
Petition to change Chuck Norris to Omar.
---
Also, Omar can play wow in notepad.
---
Also check Kala on Youtube, great guy and good advice for priest leveling.
---
I am going to be playing an Undead Priest :)
---
Interestingly after level 40 nobody cares to get off their mount for this anymore. Many of us buff because it takes no effort.
---
Why would you want the level cap raising? There's plenty of ways to make engaging content without raising the cap. They can increase the difficulty and rewards, WoW doesn't need to be tied to endless levelling if theres more progress and challenging content.
---
It died and went to Hell!
---
Group with them and give war shout^^
---
This is all well and good, but this is only end game pve content. Imagine after a year when it stacks up, won't we be in a similar situation like now, where it feels like only the max level endgame matters?
---
If they are going to with the patch 1.13 route there needs to be new content for all level ranges so the sense of scale isn't lost.
---
 i just don't like hypocrisy
---
When chuck Norris raids as a Moonkin, he is not viable, he is optimal.
---
Damn, this is getting downvoted hard. I should have just flamed streamers for ruining the immersion and not reporting bugs.
---
[They've also reformed and are recruiting to do the same stuff again in Classic.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/btk0j2/looking_for_group_monday_may_27_2019/ep0678b/)
---
Ask Jeeves?
---
I just can't see this game going into any other direction than a theme park. Vanilla is slightly more sandbox than any expansion but I don't see PvE game retaining Vanilla "values" for too long.
---
I usually /cheer or /thank indeed
---
Not really though, I just binged it and it seems plenty of people love the atmosphere of the Undercity.
---
I would argue that troll is superior even in the most casual guilds.
---
The entire end game of GW was simply inspired in so many ways.  WoW did a lot of things better, but GW had a very unique flavor of meta that saddened me when it was ditched with GW2.
---
I ran fissure of woe with my guild almost every day for more than a few months just to get obsidian armor for guild mates.  The gear wasn't any better than normal gear players could pick up at level cap, but it was [cool](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Oew5h-mT8gE/maxresdefault.jpg).
---
That's awesome.
---
The creativity of these folks. 10/10
---
You go orc and 30/0/21 as an offensive healer. This isn't a raid spec so you'll need to farm 50g often.
---
They said it was never happening, but then they heard [Omar comin’](https://youtu.be/UmtuRRhtGQw)
---
It is easier to obtain than a rare dungeon or raid drop, so it shouldn't be as good.
---
Roll mage because both are good but mages will be in abundance
---
Resilience itself was not bad per se, it was the nature of the power of arena gear itself that was the issue.
---
Arena Gear was onpar or better than Raid Gear of the same effort level.  The first season of arenas had weapons that rivaled weapons from Kael and Vashj.
---
Resilience was Defense that worked against spells and players.  The problem it introduced was the idea of 'Combating Gear-scaling with more Gear Scaling', and that idea is fucking bad.
---
Where did you get the banner?
---
You might be thinking a bit too hard about it. Introverts tend to spend more time alone because they need to recuperate from "stressful" social interaction. Thus I expect a strong correlation between being an introvert and playing video games. Also, this is reddit ... an online (mostly anonymous) message board, which probably also attracts more introverted people.

Chuck Norris can dual wield thunder fury.

Jesus can walk on water but chuck Norris can swim through land
---
It's the fixed bugs and exploits. Not features.
---
Do you want to raid? If yes and you're a priest you're going to be healing.
---
Go warlock. We look cooler and have one of the highest number of actually viable level 60 talent builds for both PvE and PvP.
---
General chat has always been bad, guild chat too to some extent.  Twitching it up is another flavor of the same shit sandwich.
---
To build on this point; Adding new pre-60 dungeons &amp; quests helps keep the 1-60 journey fresh and allows for greater player agency in determining your own path to 60.
---
Maybe a lvl 26-34 dungeon on Stonetalon Peak to fill the small gap between BFD/Stockade (24-29) &amp; Gnomer/RFK (29-35). 
---
Maybe a 33-39 dungeon in Thousand Needles &amp; a 41-47 **Pirate dungeon** in STV. 
---
Then besides that, other 58-60 dungeons to help diversify pre-raid endgame like a Furbolg Dungeon you can access once friendly with the Timbermaw to purge the cursed denizens from the depths of Timbermaw Keep within Azshara. and a Titans/Dinosaur themed dungeon accessed from somewhere within Un'goro. 
---
Dungeons aside, additional 1-60 class/race quests &amp; maybe even profession quests.
---
I think the WoW equivalent is to replace Chuck with Highoverlord Saurfang.
---
Highoverlord Saurfang uses the Maelstorm as his toilet.
---
So the real classic experience?
---
Gotta level that first aid mate.
---
I'd almost be more excited about that than about the Classic release date announcement in 2017. TBC left me unsatisfied. TBC has always felt to me like WoW hit its head as a promising youth and never really grew up into what it could have been. The prospect of a qualified group coming together to make something cohesive with the 1-60 world this time is exciting.
---
Transmog would also screw up the economy on lower level gear in the AH.
---
My first experience with wow was the  vanilla beta back in 2004.  It was so much more fun than post WOTLK.
---
Nonsense. It always worked.
---
I do love the dwarf aesthetic but that backward spin strike drives me nuts.
---
&gt; Or is this the standard omg streamers are ruining our game and holding us hostage bs?
---
Yes. You can check his post history, it's mostly him being salty at streamers and acting like he knows better than everyone. It also seems like English isn't his first language, so it's twice as painful to read as well.
---
Also, don't rush any of it. People will be satisfied with Vanilla Classic for quite some time. As grummz said, much of the art is developed already. So we've got the time to think it through and pull it off properly
---
To make it equal you'd need to make the items literally identical stat-wise to their existing BiS counterparts, which is a super dull approach. And it still creates a system where crafting materials suddenly become way more valuable, encourages things like the mafia, makes it harder to buy materials as a low-level, reduces the amount people bother with dungeons, makes it easier for the richer players to buy their pre-raid, etc. No thank you, game is fine as it is.
---
Preach
---
Not a question, but something I feel should be highlighted for all newer warriors as it needs to be said:
---
**Take the Anger Management talent (11 Arms)**
---
It doesnt matter what spec or focus you are (apart from possibly the high end fury/prot) this 11 pointer in Arms is something you should generally aim to take in every single talent build. 
---
It looks terrible on the tooltip but it has a hidden feature - it doesn't JUST reduce rage gain out of combat, it adds 1 rage to you every 3 seconds including IN combat. This means you're constantly gaining rage at all points in combat. 
---
Pop Bloodrage and you get 2-3 more rage points due to the duration it lasts. Get rooted in pvp and your rage is slowly ticking up. It's both a
---
1 point in Anger Management generates more rage in combat than FIVE points in Unbridled Wrath in Fury for most builds unless using fast dual wielding. 
---
Most of all, it just helps cover those times when you need rage most and get strings of misses or are running between mobs. It's 1 rage every 3 seconds. Sure, maybe on fights like Vael or Patchwork you wont notice it but you'll definitely notice it in lower rage situations.
---
Just take it. It's one of the best single points you can have in any talent build and most people skip it because they don't understand how it works in combat due to the terrible/incorrect tooltip.
---
Okay, I'll do my best...(Posting this and will actively edit)
---
As a priest, this is always good too!
---
Yes, people just love circlejerking even if they're dead wrong
---
I love how chunky and compact dwarfs look in plate and a shield
---
Ha, even better!
---
Horde players are so self righteous. Constant worrying "alliance are X" "alliance always do X" it's really insecure and puts me off playing horde.
---
Been theorycrafting for PvP. Thinking about a sort of gladiator stance type warrior, where i go sword n board for pvp. Could be good against spellcasters, or peeling for flag carrier, sacrificing some dps for CC and other effects. Is this a bad idea or could i make it work?
---
Fucking around with talent calculator i got something like this but i have no idea what's gonna work until classic etc. 
---

---
I hope you made him a Healthstone.
---
Chuck Norris can eat Lightning Glands, and crap Thunderfuries.
---
This is ok too!
---
That’s probably true, I was just thinking that with parry chance being 14%/parry haste, the higher health pool might help casual guilds healers out more by being able to wear a few more defense pieces. 
---
Granted, horde has wind fury, which is a threatcap nightmare and no blessing of salvation.  So you’re probably right.
---
Classic TBC without flyingmounts.... POG
---
It's called "spell batching" but for some reason they batch every single thing in the game.
---
It was worse than that. If you were queued for a warsong match and accepted the invite to a game while being a ghost (during a corpse run), you started the match as a ghost and could walk through the closed gate.
---
um what? if hollywood cant stop piracy, blizzard cant stop pservers.
---
Haha sorry it was Sharpfangg and Netharys...but tbh I think its a fairly common ganking grounds for ally...we all have fond memories of horde hospitality in that place;)
---
These people are basically playing with cheats and they're too dumb to realize it. Its a great analogy for the rich.
---
I get the impression you main a priest... :O  
---
Priests are ace, but Shamans are very good in PVP too. Their high armour values, high mobility with Ghost Wolf and adaptability with 31/0/20 talents. Excellent healers in the same groups as melee's offering WF Totem.   
---
Priests are probably better throughput - but Shamans when they shine: they really fucking shine.
---
Others talk about how to avoid pulling 3-4 mobs, i gonna talk about how to handle the situation then.
---
So, basically, run away but apply rend on one mob, the other mobs will reset while the one bleeding won't. U then kill it, and then repeat.
---
Sounds really good. That would be absolutely different game.
---
&gt; no reason to introduce TBC classic.
---
Says you?
---
I want ice lance and I want my water elemental, if you want to press frostbolt and fireblast until the end times, that's up to you.
---
i have always gone tauren and have been in plenty of higher end raiding guilds that have used tauren tanks, while the extra threat is nice its not the be all and end all of tanking, the extra hp and aoe stun are both very nice, i know the stun brings nothing on single target bosses but for ones with adds or when clearing trash in raids it helps a lot
---
Numbers made up for ease of explanation.
---
12k pop servers, 3k per layer at server launch, so 4 layers. The entire game world is layered. 3k people is similar to an original WoW server population cap. As game goes on, tourists leave in droves. As people leave, they reduce the amount of layers and increase the amount of players on each layer, until you've got 1 layer with only the people who intend on playing all the time.
---
Too early to do this. Let's wait and see how many people stay after the first few months.
---
May elune shine on you, gentle warrior.
---
Great details, glad to see someone mentioning that JoW &gt; JoL. Paladins using SoL an JoL was always a mistery to me, since mana is way effective to get even as a solo aoe tank.
---
I think the OSRS approach would be best. Fleshing out zones and dungeons/quest lines that never made it to release. Lateral improvements and gear, without changing the game too drastically or raising the level cap.
---
Sounds like a bug to me. I put the relevant patch notes in a different post, but here's a link: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bt6160/was_stratholme_ever_10_man/eoutu66/
---
Popular opinion: no
---
I actually had the same question yesterday when leveling my gnome warrior. I will be crossing over to elwynn at lvl 5 so I will be in ironforge and stormwind early on. But 20s (possibly more for ranged weapon ex. throwing knives) will be nearly impossible at lvl 5. So i will have to travel back to if soon. 
---
The first good staff weapon i believe is for a deadmines quest. So after that i will need to travel to Darnassus. But at lvl 20 10s will be no issue. 
---
Back to your question, the general Idea for Maximum efficiency is leveling with a 2handed weapon. You want to always Upgrade your weapon as much as possible to ease the difficult warrior life. So you probably should take your time to travel to if/sw if you have the coin and the weapon Upgrade for it.
---
Ask me in 5 years, for now I just want to enjoy the game without having to constantly fear new content making everything else obsolete.
---
Leave Classic as it is.
---
&gt;flying mounts
---
Sure
---
&gt;group finder
---
It was barely even used.
---
&gt;all classes for both factions.
---
Sure.
---
&gt;multi-faction city making faction
---
Yup, super bad.
---
&gt;small dungeons (3-4 bosses each).
---
I get why raids or heroic dungeons can't be acessible to everyone but making it possible for busy parents to run a dungeon isn't a bad thing, imo. 
---
&gt;convenient dungeon locations + summoning &gt;stones. No more adventure time to get to a &gt;dungeon.
---
It was an adventure to get to SM while leveling but getting to a dungeon while being on the same level as the zone has never been an adventure.
---
&gt;quest hubs. Fun at first, but we all know what &gt;this system lead to in the end.
---
Vanilla is full of quest hubs.
---
&gt;multiple difficulties for dungeons. So they made &gt;the dungeons shorter, but to balance it out you &gt;had to clear them more often and in addition to &gt;that in heroic modes that were 90% the same. &gt;Also we know what this lead to later down the &gt;line.
---
Yes, they made dungeons relevant and actually difficult. 
---
Why does it matter if something started in tbc? As  long as it's still good in tbc that's what matters.
---
Anyone who complains about sharding is either a troll or ignorant.
---
Can you imagine how unstable launch would be without it? Impossible.
---
To make a parallel Fortnite, love it or loathe it wasn't created to be a Battle Royale. You would be absolutely mental from any business perspective to say fuck it and scrap the whole Battle Royale aspect of the game now because you preferred the PvZ version.  
---
There's no reason PvE and PvP in WoW can't coexist, and trying to appeal to tradition to force it not to coexit is a very poor take.
---
Thanks. I hoped the night where darker. :(
---
En echo chamber..., but still, a damn representative one at 100k+.
---
Some people are thinking that if not ALL Classic players (and some) are on r/classicwow , whatever is the opinion here is "wrong", because only 100k are here.
---
Most opinion polls asking couple thousand people are proven wrong. But the very few that are asking 10k+ are always on the money.
---
The opinion of 100k people on a reddit subforum might "sound" like an echo chamber...but it's also right, because it is representative enough for Classic community.
---
Because then there would be severe imbalances with items, Naxx gear already makes endgame extremely unbalanced when players obtain it adding more to that would just more it even worse, not having progressive itemization already makes classes stronger than they should be we definitely don’t need more.
---
The only way this could be done is if Blizzard does a stat squish and that would definitely ruin the entire game.
---
The question isn't if we want it.
---
The question is if we want it enough to pay a subscription long enough to justify the work being done.
---
I haven't been this excited about WoW in a very long time.
---
The hype is real.
---
This dam was the first thing my brother saw of wow while I was playing. The next day he bought the game and rolled a dwarf priest!
---
I used to play a lot of TBC hunter so I don't know how much it can relate, but pet is no problem. You pick food up from mobs to give to your pet and it kind of becomes a habbit to feed it.
---
Ammo though was a pain really. Even without the bag slot issues the cost of arrows quickly stacks up. If you plan on playing casual and don't make some gold, you will spend your entire money on arrows or bullets. That goes for maily higher end ammo, but is still a pain.
---
It's not about the single target dps though. Except for Molten Core most good guilds will clear each raid in the first reset, most likely during the first night of progression.
---
Speed running will be a thing and for that Sappers are great. It let's you quickly AoE down trash packs and quickly deal with adds on certain boss fights. It's not so much about the pure dps it brings, more the utility of quickly being back on dealing with the boss.
---
You are confusing equal with identical. They could make them somewhat equal in power but still different.
---
Yeah my perspective is that the 100 extra hp isn't going to matter much and even if it did it would take a troll 100 seconds to make up that difference anyway.
---
I was going to say the same thing but then i thought lemme go check all the comments and sure enough the one calling out the bullshit classic drama mentality is downvoted. 
---
It seems he's just a karma whore, don't sweat it.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but that means weapon skills will be a huge deal. 
---
" Let's say you increase your weapon skill by 4.  Against a mob 3 levels higher than you, you get: 0.8% lower chance to miss, 0.4% lower chance to get dodged, 2.4% to be parried, and a 0.8% higher chance to crit. "
---
Chuck Norris had a machine fetish.
---
Back in the 80s, the guy got so drunk that he ran around a national highway inserting his joystick in every vehicle he sees. The media never published it out of fear for their lives so the public never knew about it.
---
The result was a group machine/human hybrids that went on a war against each other for child support. The event inspired the "Transformers" franchise.

Same here 😂 never reached lvl 60 in vanilla but had like 5 twinks lvl 19. Multiple shadowfangs and assassin blades but never got mongoose on them in tbc. What was new in tbc for 19 bracket though, is the leg enchants.

I def want to learn more about it. Thanks!

I’m glad people like you still exist on this sub, this place is getting a bit out of hand lately.
---
Question regarding macros.
---
As I've not really played BFA or later expansions at any other level than the first month and last month for the story, I've no idea what macros work with their new iteration of the system. Back in the day, I knew them all.
---
I intend to play Warrior as my main come release and would like to hear if someone knows a good list of macros and/or guides to getting into the new system - preferably with a focus on warriors for classic. Cheers :)
---
Unfortunatly doesnt do enough damage, warrior support is peals from your high dmg
---
People keep saying this because it's trendy to be a racials "min-maxer" on Reddit these days, it makes you feel like you're "someone" - even if what you're saying is BS. 
---
Adding to your argument, there are also less warlocks on alliance side on PvE server, so obviously WotF has nothing to with class choice. There are significantly more Druids on Alliance side than on Horde side because Night Elves look better, there are more UD warlocks than Orc warlocks on PvP servers because UD are cooler, etc. 
---
This desperate attention to racials for min-maxing does not represent the playerbase at all, and is overall retarded.
---
Third faction is also an answer to faction imbalance since then the two  could gang up on the one if they become too unbalanced.
---
So Gnome warrior, will they still have terrain difficulties with charges etc.? (I believe this was a thing in vanilla but never played gnome warrior back then)
---
Like they couldn't stop Nostalrius? Kek

Violent video game btw
---
I am also glad I won't be playing on US servers. I just can't stand these entitled fake-reaction streamers.  🤮
---
On separat servers, I don't care. But adding TBC talents into classic wow ruins it.
---
so you would rather see a classic server die from lack of content than try to keep it fresh once it has hit that point? i'm not talking about 3-4 top guild have cleared naxx lets release TBC level i mean even the most casual of guilds is clearing naxx with little to no problem, at that point i think new stuff could be added without having to rework all the character balance like they do with expansions, maybe look at using CoT to add in extra content at 60? make the emerald dream how they planned to in vanilla not how it was in legion, open up mount hyjal with content in there there is loads they can do without the need to change the actual game, just roll out new patches for it
---
I'm currently in STL but all my buddies are back in Dallas. Works at like 500 DPS right now which is awesome but really puts me in a position where I cant step away or its gonna screw a lot of people over. 
---
Ty for the invite tho, hopenyou guys have a blast! Maybe we will meet one day in the World... of Warcraft :)
---
This hits me so hard :D
---
Been playing a bit on TBC private server while waiting for Classic. I play a paladin and everytime im out in the world and someone buffs me while i ride past them i turn around and try to figure out who it was and where he is. If i dont manage to find him and return the favor i feel really really bad :d
---
This has been discussed a lot throughout the community pretty much since the Beta started.
---
While the 1.13 route could be great, it's pretty obvious that it won't happen. 
---
There are enough people (most likely the majority) that really want a TBC legacy server. This option will save millions in development costs and it's something that people will most likely prefer.
---
I don't know about you, but do you really trust current Blizzard with developing new content for a Vanilla style game?
---
This was a make or break moment for the group.
---
Never heard of them.
---
Yeah, this is the approach i think would be best. Hopefully it kind be done it a fun and meaningful way.
---
Well spoken like someone whose never traversed black rock mountain on a populated server.

---
My second shot at mage tower skins has become slightly more realistic
---
Yea, i usually keep them in my bag and give to healers during dungeon runs :P
---
Im especially curious about shaman viability now that totem stomp macros wont work (i used them as a hunter but they made things too stacked against thrm).
---
That’s what happened when I parked my character on top of the org bank
---
When your mommy and I fight, it doesn't mean that we don't love you. Sometimes nommy just have to stay with Grandma to get away from all of the chaos.
---
I sure as f*ck do not want this. take my downvote.
---
i actually partly agree with you. however, i think it is possible.
---
What i am certain, and is fairly obvious is that classic will be bigger, much bigger on launch which is normal.
---
However 2-3 months from launch, i think it is possible BUT not because classic will get back to its glory hype numbers of growing from 0 to 8 million in 2 years but more because retail already does not have that many subs. most likely less than 2 million (probably much less during content droughts).
---
i personally see classic wow stabilizing at 1 million users. but reaching 3-5 million around launch period.
---
Youd wanna spam b shout it gives more aggro
---
THE MOVIES ON!
---
:(((((  
---
Imagine that. Reading about some fun shit going on on your server, and IT'S NOT THERE! And you have to go run metagaming circles to get into the layer, and now your immersion is irrecoverably ruined.
---
I know layering solves a problem, and it's a bitter medicine we're probably better off with. But the side effects are so severe, it hurts so much.
---
It's gonna be bad. You'd get more mileage out of just playing a regular arms warrior. In both cases you'll need a healer in order to really get anything done, and the arms warrior is just a bigger wrecking ball. A prot warrior who runs around stunning and shield-bashing people isn't as disruptive as an arms warrior who slaughters people.
---
Death Knights were kinda way too good in season 5 and 6. Towards the middle and end of WoTLK they were just fine.
---
Why in this sub? It's not relevant. Try r/wow.
---
Hey man- It's Bearucelee from the guild. I stopped playing though. I also want to play RP-PvP but they're not actually doing an RP-PvP server at the moment.
---
If we want an RP-PvP server, we're going to have to convince them.
---
He asked to explain like he is five and you go and write all this stuff that a five year old would not be able to grasp due to attention span difficulties and big words like controversial.   I really hate it when people don’t explain things like someone is actually a five year old.
---
No, I remember it perfectly.
---
He did actually say he deeply regretted his statement later, and it was a bit of a meme at their office too. 
---
I just can't remember my source for that at all..
---
AoE looting
---
Nameplates at a longer range (if the script isn't actually a true vanilla working script).
---
Resource cost buff after ressing at a GY in BGs so you don't have to drink after buffing. It's the only thing really annoying me about deciding on a class, because having played Rogue since Vanilla through until now, it's just too slow paced for me.
---
&gt; mocked up the classic db working with new client as a proof of concept
---
100% unrelated to the classic db website, in case anyone was wondering.
---
who knew devs are getting less time and money invested in them to make games nowadays, with budget and decisions given to marketing people.
---
Stadia is not somrthing you want. It will be laggy for the most part and more expensive in the long term. Its always cheaper to own than to rent.
---
Tbh i think blizzard will leave classic as it is. The whole point of this is to preserve the game as it was in it's best state.
---
However, they could expand on the game on separate servers and in that case, as i discussed with some gentleman or gentlewoman or gentlewhatever in another thread, they could do parallel progression by making the gear that comes with new content a requirement to be able to do that content. So for example it would be just a certain type of resistance, but the stat values of those items would be the same.
---
For sure used to play on PvE in Vanilla. So the difference getting ganked in the area. People still managed to getting there. Not an issue.
---
I trust that they want money atleast. The best way to make money from the classic community is to provide the content they want, either new or previously existing.
---
Indeed, I am still bitter over never getting my Shaman patch!  
---
BusShock!  
---
. 
---
But that wasn’t OPs point, the act of getting there is what makes the game special, regardless of if it’s simple or not.
---
Oh no
---
It’s retarded :(
---
No buff makes me drop whatever I'm doing to run into the nearest camp of gnolls like thorns does.
---
You have a tray with glasses on it.
---
The tray is the server and the glasses are the layers.
---
Each drop of water poured into a glass is a person.
---
When a Glass gets full. Water stops being poured into that glass and another glass is used for more droplets of water to be poured into.  
---
That’s what layering is
---
Y'all are joking, right?
---
I think the opposite is true and that there are more Horde streamers, including some big ones like Sodapoppin, Mizkif, and Sonii. However, I would argue that the alliance streamers seemed to be more involved with classic beforehand, such as Esfand. Maybe that explains it.
---
Shadow priest undoubtedly, ele shaman needs some serious gear (AQ level) to become a serious threat (not including twinking).
---
As a priest you also overall have more fun utility with on demand silence and mind control and Blackout procs will make you smile.
---
everyone says seasonal and i never asked. does it mean every 3 months ??? wouldn't that hurt the game and shouldn't be set to a yearly new servers, so that you split the people who want to start anew into 2 communities and not more.
---
I’m a little out of the loop about this, is it true?
---
I wish there was a ball mode like Peggle.
---
Ooh, I like that idea. Would also make pvp kind of fun with different resistance gears to choose from.
---
I really don't think that's 'the only way this could be done', there's plenty of different similar item level content they could add, or even more lower level gear to bring to the table.
---
WoW is a huge world, there's lots of routes they could go down that aren't TBC and I'd sooner they did that than we end up in Outland.
---
It seems you have accepted your fate
---
When I’m on my paladin I always throw blessing of wisdom on the lock and blessing of might on the void.  Or if the lock has another pet other than void walker, they also get wisdom.  I’ve also noticed that the random buffing while passing players is much more prevalent on the horde side than the alliance side, but that could just be my experience/luck.
---
Of course there are!  FOR GNOMEREGAN! 
---
This night elf will be famous all over the world and her heroic deeds will be sung for generations  to come!
---
I also feel as a warlock in classic I could stream and help new players.
---
Not that I want to be a "streamer" I am 47 and have a good job 😊
---
Other name?  
---
Obviously :  "Snakes on the Plains Walking"
---
Cringe
---
Booty Bay Bruiser. Fuck those guys
---
TBC —&gt; Wrath —&gt; Live + fresh batch of vanilla servers.
---
Instead of going straight from WotLK to live, they could continue on into Cata, and MoP from there.  I’d probably play Cata, less of a chance of MoP.  Zero chance I’d play anything from WoD and beyond tho.
---
NA stress test ping was super playable from western EU, I was impressed
---
Wait they’re stopping sharding?
---
I'm sure that's what Omar told game design when he added himself.
---
Yeah lol hating on streamers is the FOTM.
---
Maybe you could add a line on top saying this is sort of semi-fanfiction? Maybe people will pay a bit more attention that way.
---
Here's an actual ELI5:
---
Imagine you are trying to pour a big jug of water (total server population) into a glass (layer). When the glass gets full, you introduce a new glass. Once that gets full you introduce a new glass and so on until the big jug is empty.
---
The purpose is to reduce the amount of total servers needed to maintain stable gameplay. This effectively increasing the active player base on each server.
---
Not from a Jedi
---
No, it’s just wonky sarcasm
---
Damn right !
---
But, here is the catch : Classic WoW will bring in more than 2 million new subs, and that is more than $30 million / month.
---
Blizzard is a multi-billion company, and any income that is in the low millions is disregarded. Since they bring back Classic, it is safe to assume that the decision was made after a market study that showed that Classic WoW will bring in at least tens of millions / month.
---
Make no mistake, nobody here can estimate how many people will play Classic long term...but Blizzard CAN. Blizzard is estimating tens of millions in income, monthly, from Classic...if they weren't, Classic WoW would still be a dream.
---
If Classic isn't bringing in at least $200-300 million / year, for at least 5 years...Blizzard would have simply reject it as a project, because it would be, financially, a project rejected by the stock owners.
---
It's not rocket science : Classic is here because Blizzard KNOWS it will make a lot of money, not a few millions, but hundreds.
---
Financially speaking, in Blizzard's terms of what is profitable, Classic WoW is estimated, by them, to have, long term, millions of players.
---
If some people think that Blizzard is releasing Classic WoW for 100k people...those people are simply nuts. to think that a company that makes $2 billion/year, as a part of a bigger conglomerate that makes $7 billion/year, would EVER bring back a game for ONLY 100k subs (no loot boxes, no cash shop, no other revenue from Classic), that represents a measly $1,5 million / month...it's pure STUPIDITY.
---
Wanna estimate how many people will play Classic long term? It's simple : Blizzard is expecting hundreds of millions a year from Classic, and that means millions of people. How many millions ? Only Blizzard knows, but it is DAMN SURE that is millions of players.
---
Nost went down voluntarily... The fact you didnt know this shows how much you dont know about any of this.
---
Hang out near Ratchet and you're a god...
---
&gt; alt tab &gt; watch porn   
---
at least that was the classic sequence, these days we have 2 or 3 screens obviously, so the alt tab can be skipped....
---
Almost like it was when *gasp* vanilla actually launched?
---
/bow is my goto
---
Or you can be a warlock and give out those sweet underwater breathing buff miles away from water 😊
---
I wrote it for myself bro. My soul was guiding my pencil :) I respect it, If people don't like it. It's not fiction. I was there. Playing football on the field when the ground was shaking.
---
Oh my plus the winterspring elixir for ap and one of the str pots that increase your size.... xD
---
While I do enjoy starting fresh every now and then, I think this would divide the community way too much.
---
Thanks!
---
Boomer reactions. “Wow!” screams the boomer, repeating something they did 14-15 years ago.
---
You'll wanna go for rank 10 which pretty much anyone can accomplish, especially if you have a healer with you a lot of the time. The rank 10 gear will be your main stuff for a really long time, unless of course you can get rank 13, but it doesn't sound like you would.
---
The R10 set is very nice. Compared to the R13 set, it has about 20 less strength, 40 less stamina, and something like 2% less crit. That's not the end of the world. It's surprisingly excellent. When AV opens, you'll be able to get a TuF which is also a solid (but not amazing) weapon that literally anyone can get once it's available.
---
Warriors have an easy enough time getting "pretty good gear" but a very hard time getting great gear, so if you're satisfied with not-BiS, it's fine. It's a class that doesn't feel amazing until you do have insane gear, but it's not like it's terrible without it.
---
so you take sharding, then apply it to the entire continent, then you rename it layering.
---
somehow the community eats this shit up even though sharding is on the top 5 list of things that ruined WoW.
---
What a coward you are.
---
You insult me and every low wage worker in a sweep and then report me for calling you out on it. 
---
What a coward you are. I hope you sleep well at night.
---
Some of the things that made classic cool is that in many items the ilvl didn't matter. You just have create interesting items to make dungeons worthwhile. In retail it's basically higher ilvl = better item.
---
And yes, i think Naxx's itemlevel was already too high.
---
Oh you mean a tauren on kodo and an elixir of giant growth?
---
Many hours of the stress test server was stream viewers spamming every chat with “INVITE ME TO (X STREAMER’s) LAYER PLS PLS”
---
Hey man, it can be great in watery areas. It sucks trying to farm Murlocs or underwater mobs when you have to keep swimming up to the surface every time.
---
Now that I think about it.. Would be great for classic launch. Less competition for underwater mobs since it'd be slower xp/hr and a pita without unending breath...
---
Diversity doesn't make a game good. Look at how diverse retail is with regards to end game content. There's WAY more to do but nothing is focused so everything ends up sucking and is shallow. There's some much random shit to do in retail at end game. 
---
That said, diversity isn't necessary a bad thing, but it's not what makes a game good either.
---
I could only bring myself to do it 5 or so times per week, despite having 20+ characters that can farm it. Just demoralizing after a certain point
---
laughs in undead
---
Did anyone else double take when they saw 1k needles? Made me laugh!
---
Right, Rake is in mulgore
---
&gt; I really don't think that's 'the only way this could be done', there's plenty of different similar item level content they could add, or even more lower level gear to bring to the table.
---
If you do this then people will just skip the content that they don’t need and find the path of least resistance in order to obtain gear, the beauty of classic is that every class needed to dip in a little bit of everything towards the early endgame to get the items they need and if they add new items that will definitely mess with that flow.
---
What you’re suggesting is exactly how the modern game works and imo is why it’s complete dogshit, Naxx gear is definitely overtuned and without straight up nerfing a lot of the items blizzard would not be able to balance them especially with new items from new content
---
Im an Elemental Shaman only main. Mained it from TBC till Wrath. We had bad expension and good expensions but in classic. We suck balls ( PvE perspective )
---
I love my Elemental shaman but I also love serieus raid progression. I had to pick and picked serieus progression. I know I can't have it all and seeing Elemental shamans be viable in Classic would be fun. But than its not a true Vanilla experience.
---
After 3 years eigther TBC comes and make my favorite spec viable OR new classic content/balancing  comes to make it viable. Than I would play it.
---
But I would hate to see changes to the core of vanilla even when it fits me. Autenthenticity is the main goal.
---
gtfo, OP isn't retarded.
---
Then please enlighten us with your obvious better knowledge.
---
After 10 years of being shunned and rejected by Blizzard, and seeing our beloved game going to shit...what the hell did you expected?
---
It's absolutely NORMAL to hold a grudge in these conditions.
---
If you want 'quick kills' you shouldnt be going for a Druid. Rogue or Hunter without a doubt, with higher-end gear a Hunter that knows how to play is probably one of the worst things to face in PvP for many classes.
---
Thats not to say a decked out feral druid cant kill people, but if healing, a focus on mobility and outliving enemies isnt something you are truly looking forward to play I would avoid Druid.
---
Double the xp needed for each level
---
Double the price of mounts
---
Increase the length of time between content patches by about 40%.
---
They went back to the roots of the game (classic) but then they did surveys with the high level, serious, players to design new content. All of this content was made with the classic philosophy in mind.
---
Just go Alch and give away a pot every time you get buffed :)
---
Give RPPvP server pls!
---
Rofl, Nost got slapped with C&amp;D and they risked being sued out of their retirement money. There's a different in apprehending millions of people torrenting shit off Piratebay, and sending police on concentrated Hub of piracy(you know, like they've done to Piratebay).
---
Nost went down "voluntarily" because they'd be all ruined if not for that. The fuck are you talking about.
---
It will still only be a sub. So either way they are making the same amount. But with BC, they would net more.
---
So does this mean the first 3 days of my 2 week vacation im taking off for launch i will actually be able to play or still 9 million person server ques for hours?
---
Then we are in agreement, I also agree with myself.   
---
Personally I think WoW hit it's peak either in Black Temple in TBC or in Ulduar in Wrath.  
---
Anything from Trial of the Crusader and beyond is pure downhill though. That much I think we all can agree on.
---
And a front-loaded class resource. That's even more important.
---
1. Guild Banks
---
Thankfully it’ll be a couple years before a lot of the content becomes redundant, at least for raiders. So the classic team has plenty of time to figure out the future of the game.
---
It sounds fantastic- The only thing is that I'm really not decided between alliance and horde for classic. I'll probably play alliance at the moment.
---
They're all great
---
Nope nope nope
---
Orcs moved planet, why can't Drainei looking for a better life or to get away from demons? And the starting area for them can be in outland and they portal to Azeroth.
---
Chuck Norris went skydiving only once.  He decided one Grand Canyon was enough.
---
I never understood this attitude. I've had 6 60s over 2 PServers. Once my guild fell apart on the first, I just stopped playing on it. Left those 2 60s behind and I didn't feel any sense of loss. Once I cleared Naxx on the other one, I was done and I left those 4 characters behind. What else were you gonna do with them? The servers are dead post Naxx anyway.
---
It's just as much about the journey, the experiences and the friends and enemies you make along the way as it is the pixels.
---
Preach is the only one I can tolerate. Also Defcamp and Melderon (sp?) are pretty chill. The rest are trash, Asmon in particular.
---
WoD was a colossal failure as well, with the expansion offering absolutely nothing outside of raiding and an utterly retarded Facebook waiting game (and lets not forget about the glorious selfie cam)
---
They didn't make any effort to remedy it. They abandoned it. There is no way they are gonna scrap BfA. If anything they'll abandon it again because that clusterfuck is just irredeemable.
---
That’s why you roll a pally. Same as warrior, but with more
---
It always was.
---
He Does not know how hard to get there. I don’t think he mentions If it makes it special or not. In fact I said is it not an issue will have no effect on Doing raids or whatever. Dont have to see too much into every comment about classic. Getting to a certain dungeon was not hard or had any effect on doing it. Getting the group for instances What is more interesting and in fact makes Vanilla special cause you have to interact people. Also main problem with LFR not teleporting into dungeon But the fact that you need no interaction with others, also that dungeons are simplified and So easy that no communication needed while in Vanilla you had discuss even trash (cc, sheep, etc).
---
I like Frostadamus
---
True, good point.
---
Anything other than herp derp nO cHaNgEs
---
Streamers like asmongold and stuff literally get BIS and money handed to them.
---
I mean.. He litteraly said explain it to me like im five years old..
---
Pfft, like I won't be using those lol. Spirit is good on every class.
---
&gt;is there a guide to levelling in a way that you get to experience what as many zones have to offer as possible while not doing quests that reward basically no XP and have no value?
---
There aren't enough quests in most zones to get you through the entire level range it's for, so efficient levelling requires you to change areas regularly. 
---
So just about any levelling guide will do.
---
Wrath is two things. It's the peak and the beginning of the end.  
---
The tokens, the welfare epics, the tools to avoid people where introduced during Wrath.  
---
But the initial Wrath experience was really really good. And Ulduar was a class in itself.  
---
So that's why people are a bit divided. And it's also one of the reasons Blizzard didn't really understand what they had started doing when they removed all the obstacles. It wasn't apparent until everyone was jaded and gone from the game.
---
Yeah once severs settle down etc sharding will be no longer it's just for the initial phase so we dont have stupid que times etc or over population or players trying to kill 8 bores in elwynn forest.
---
Honestly this is mostly to what you prefer yourself, do you like DoTing? Most popular warlock specs are about DoTs, so if nuking is more your thing I would avoid warlock. Thats not to say there arent Destro locks in pvp, bu they are definitely on the weaker spectrum of specs that warlock has and it'll make you sweat real hard vs melee. If you are cool with this, Warlock is a good choice.
---
For utility and solo farming aswell as leveling, Mage would be your pick here. It simply is more mana effective and damage efficient than a Shadow Priest. If you aren't interested in healing at one point, I'd go Mage.
---
I dont know the best way to run a hardcore raiding guild but I do know most hardcore raiding guilds are already done planning and recruiting.
---
I joined a semi-hardcore guild and we have everything planned out already + we have a filled roster. And we are not even hardcore.
---
My advise is, if you want to be part of a hardcore raiding guild, join one instead of making one. Its like a part-time job. Besides the 20-30 hours a week you put into your own character you put another 10-15 hours discussing and orginazing with other staff members. Being a GM of a hardcoreguild is a real pain in the ass and sacrafices have to be made.
---
But I wish you luck in whatever plans you have.
---
It’s annoying as a mage. “Here’s my 200 mana MoTW” “...here’s my 1300 AI, now I gotta full drink again”
---
EU and other zones have smaller playerbases, thus meaning less servers.
---
I would say your odds of getting on a streamers server is much higher on EU due to the fact that there will be tons of people packed and layered into a few servers.
---
I know it’s a popular circlejerk in this subreddit to shit on streamers but if you’re on a balanced PVP server I can’t see how they can’t make your experience even better. I’m sure a bigger part of it is fueled off of jealousy due to the fact they’re getting millions to play the same game we all play but playing an MMO with tons of people is fun regardless of if they stream or not.
---
You don't know what the difference is between a CEO and a president and yet you're commenting about his motives as an actor in that role.  Maybe figure that out before you share your ignorance with the world.
---
I think there’s a lot going on that’s kinda hard to juggle. I was watching Mark Kern on twitch and he was struggling to play and respond to chat. It sometimes seems like streaming is this super easy thing but I think there’s a bit more to it
---
Alright! A step in the direction to get my money again.
---
It's not easy and involves a lot of walking until lvl 40, but it's really rewarding. In a lot of cases you have to start quests in a zone and do just half of the zone, the quests that require less level. Then you move to another zone and repeat the same, then come back to that previous zone to complete the higher level ones, and so on. You basically do only "green" quests all the time.
---
I downloaded a very simple addon that puts the quest level in the tittle, like "\[6\] QUest title". So some times I will go to a place, take all the quests just to know their level, take some notes and drop them to take them later when convenient. You have to have in mind that the log can only have 20 quests.
---
I'm not sure if there's any guide out there that has "calculated" an static way to do so, maybe you can just check one of those maps that says the range level of an area and make an idea of when to go :)
---
UC should be all rights be the main horde city in Classic, for the same reasons IF is the alliance’s!
---
Flying mounts are great as long as the surrounding content is designed for them. Adding flying to Kalimdor and EK in Cata is where things really started to fall off.
---
Yike
---
That was less beneficial t than starting capping earlier in Arathi.
---
Still, I think all Battlegrounds exploits should be fixed for Classic. It doesn't matter if people get into Hyjal or Old Ironforge or whatever, but I want battlegrounds to be fair fights. And no, "both sides can do it" doesn't really make it ok.
---
garbage in terms of what?  
---
skill? personality?  
---
Try Preach. He's top tier player and chill guy.
---
What makes sodapoppin insufferable lol?
---
Spell batching should be FOR SPELLS ONLY. Not looting. Not players dying. Not the flag.
---
Well yeah I agree but comparing anything in Classic to BFA obviously makes BFA look like trash in every aspect of the game so you are correct.
---
You know the 19 twink brackets also incluse backstabbing some levek 14s.
---
I think Ill go for rogue.
---
It would divide the community no more than it is now.  The first generation of servers would be merged into Live WoW, and a fresh batch of Classic servers would release.  
---
To me, Classic WoW begins with Vanilla and continues through the first half of WotLK and the Ulduar patch.  The TotC (T9) patch added dungeon finder and this to me was the exact cutoff and distinguishing featuring that separates Classic WoW from modern WoW.  Dungeon finder was only the beginning, and they of course went on to add raid finder, x-realm dungeon finder, phasing, sharding, etc. which only took modern WoW further from Classic WoW, but the dungeon finder feature is truly the feature that separates the two eras of the game for me.
---
I feel like they’d be completely missing a ton of fantastic quality content in TBC and WotLK if they didn’t progress to these two expansions.  Both of which are every bit as Classic to me than vanilla. If they could do the second half of WotLK without dungeon finder, I’d be even happier.
---
Omar el hussein? 😭
---
Then have it changed to it fitting a Classic experience?
---
I find it weird how there is a huge crowd that wants nothing added to Vanilla Classic WoW, do you really want to do the same content over and over?
---
Wouldn't it be a great experience to have a ton of expansion in the end, but keep it feeling like how it was in Vanilla? 
---
Blizzard had absolute huge plans with Vanilla WoW, it took them 3 expansion to get even somewhat close to the intended plan. 
---
For instance, the only way you were supposed to get a Death Knight was to sacrifice your character into turning it into one. That's exactly the sort of RPG flavour that could find into Classic WoW.
---
Anal [Rupture]
---
But Soda has played for like 16 hours a day since it came out farming his BiS. Is it really cheating if you put all the time and effort in yourself?
---
Stop it, I can only get so hard
---
Well, it was equal before, now it's somewhat equal. I'm not gonna bother discussing it if the goalposts are gonna keep moving, let's agree to disagree.
---
Warrior doesn't do anything in PvP without Mortal Strike. Next best advantage per point of talent is Cruelty so you have about 15 points to put into prot, basically for Iron Will and Last Stand.
---
I know right! It's worse than a warrior, because it feels like you should be able to, and yet you cannot!
---
It mostly means to break it down in an understandable way without trying to explain the technological aspect of it. 
---
Thanks for the info, /u/Ebola_Burrito
---
How the dwarves haven't repaired this is beyond me
---
&gt; do you really trust current Blizzard with developing new content for a Vanilla style game?
---
I trust the community even less to be able to make good decisions for the game.
---
Orcs didn't *really* move planet, they invaded Azeroth and got stuck in there due to being captured as war slaves.
---
&gt; Why can't Drainei looking for a better life or to get away from demons?
---
Because you have to make up entire new storyline to explain how they got there. World of Warcraft at launch is picking up stories where we left them and creates new ones as you level up.
---
Also why would the broken Draenei leave? Last time we see them is literally when they made their own space finally. It was TBC that retconned that a little bit.
---
Honestly about the only thing I'd change is 40 man requirements.
---
5, 10, 15 allows for better design and decreases the window of error but, most importantly, you don't need 39 other players.
---
Huge raids are fun, but you can do a lot more with mechanics and overall raid design using fewer slots, requiring more classes pull their weight.
---
But I think the most difficult part of the game wasn't at all difficulty related, it was getting 39 other folks who like to raid the same time you do.
---
Other than that the game is pretty much fine as-is.
---
BUT make all these on seperate servers. all of this IF made will take quite some time. so give the no change servers, and seperate ones with the added content.
---
No changes server will be seasonal and progressive servers will be on-going. if it does extremely well, then they can run 3 separate instances with the 3rd being tbc, and then 4-5 years from now wotlk classic.
---
This is all wishful thinking and MY OPINION of what would satisfy everybody, but to be frank am already over the moon that i get to go back home! home to vanilla azeroth...
---
Raided bot tbc and vanilla, loved both
---
I edited a short 4 point tl;dr in that I guess covers what I was trying to say.
---
In classic Ill visit like 10-15 zones regulairly. In modern wow I visit 6 at max.
---
Venruki is pretty chill and good at the game. I like Preach too.
---
Monkeynews, perplexity, most of the guys from APES are entertaining and very knowledgeable about classic.
---
Cross realm confirmed
---
Hi. Could u please elaborate, what he did with runescape?
---
I can't give you an exact timeline, but I can tell you that I needed 16 days / played for level 60 as a hunter with absolutely no experience in MMO's. I was 12 or 13 years old as I started. Even had to learn using WASD to move :D
---
On account of the "Missing Diplomat" quest, I think Dustwallow Marsh is a zone that you should visit, and you'll have to go through the Wetlands to get to Menethil Harbor to get there. It's not packed with quests, but it has that little goblin town that I found really interesting.
---
I definitely also have a lot more memories of the lower-level zones. I was a very slow leveller and definitely something of an altoholic, so I went through Elwynn and Dun Morogh a fair number of times. Arathi felt like a big field of grass with not a lot to do, and likewise the Alterac Mountains were too small to actually have anything in them - but that made them mysterious and strange, and I really liked Hillsbrad sandwiched in between. And as a dwarf, I loved the Hinterlands. That said, there's a reason some of those zones got the biggest revamps in Cataclysm - they really didn't see the most questing. Weirdly, for how much people tend to love Stranglethorn Vale, I kind-of never went there. Too intimidating, probably.
---
At the point where I really started liking dungeons, I kept running Maraudon and Uldaman - but Desolace and the Badlands were, arguably, two of the "worst" zones in the classic game (although the centaur quests in Desolace were a first taste of reputation grinding, so that's interesting). Likewise, the Swamp of Sorrows kind of feels like a big zone built around the Sunken Temple with not a lot of questing. The same goes for Feralas and Dire Maul.
---
I remember when I came up with my first RP characters on a roleplay server, I made them from my favorite places in the game - places that don't exist in the form they were back then. So, the nostalgia for the original Southshore and the original Loch Modan are going to be massive for me.
---
Couldn't disagree more, flying mounts completely kill navigating the terrain. You can skip too much too easily, it becomes very dull, fly somewhere do a quest, leave. It's exactly why the last two WoW expansions removed them for half the game.
---
Cap your game at 15 FPS for maximum authenticity
---
When in doubt, blame LAYERING
---
Warrior: two good dps specs plus the ultimate tanking spec.
---
&gt;Is it really cheating if you put all the time and effort in yourself?
---
They're not though. They're getting hundreds of hours of rewards for the same amount of time that the average player puts in.
---
No that’s not what an ELI5 is.  My explanation was 10x better
---
Does he know this? I'm getting the impression that he doesn't know this.
---
There is a ton of empty space on the map, space that had content planned for and scrapped for later expansions or cut permanently.
---
There's plenty to add during or after going to Outlands or Northrend.
---
Hahhahahaha amazing!
---
More threat from the tank means more overall dps, Windfury increases tank threat, which benefits casters hunters &amp; melee alike. 
---
There's also Tranquil air totem if you're constantly threat capped, and Trolls are known to put out some great threat with Berserking. None of which are as easy as Salvation, but there are methods.
---
Hey man, you seem to have read my comment and just bursted out into flames of your strong personal opinions, I agree with most of what you said but that doesn’t reject the fact the philosophy behind the way Death Knights were designed is absolutely garbage. Having a class that is known as a “hero class” that does everything better than every other class is horrible design and if they do what you say I hope they realize that.
---
Most people with fond memories of WOTLK most likely played a DK like 60% of the population did back then.
---
I'd check Preach's streams.
---
It's fun to watch him gradually start building up steam as he goes from "well I'll check it out just for the nostalgia" to just getting really deep into the enjoyment and hype of the whole thing over the course of the first couple videos till he's firmly on board by level 18.
---
It helps he's been more casual and laid back about the whole thing. Since aside for being a really good tank, he's playing about the way you'd expect your a fairly casual play experience to be.
---
none of that rushing to Cap stuff the rest of the streamers did in a like a day.
---
1. No layering
---
2. No cross realm battlegrounds
---
3. No jello water
---
Imagine being so incapable of reading comprehension that words scare you.
---
lol, I hadn't even noticed them on first watching,  they are great
---
Your explanation was good as well. It's not a race..
---
I mained elemental shaman from tbc fill bfa. I Had to make a choise between my favorite class/spec, the elemental shaman. And my favorite thing to do, progrevise raiding.
---
I choise progrevise raiding and went with mage.
---
Preach and Frost are great. Swifty is really good too.
---
do the mom we want omar!
---
no we have omar at home!
---
omar at home: J Allen Brack image
---
You shouldn't have open the chat window. It's your own fault. No doubt.
---
I think he is the lead designer or developer for classic
---
You didn't play vanilla if you started in BC.
---
Swifty, Esfand when he isn't playing with Asmon, chinglishtv, Towelliee.
---
I just get annoyed cause I used to visit the ELI5 subreddit and nobody there hardly ever actually explained like someone was five. That’s how it’s meant to be. You got to talk to someone like they are actually five
---
Guild Bank
---
Guild Calendar
---
Personally, I'd quite like the updated character models too, but that's cos they came out just after I quit so I never got to see them really.
---
Tantrum + WoW = I'm not watching this stupid channel. Definitely doesn't sound entertaining.
---
Love KingGothalian though. He's goofy af and a pretty nice dude.
---
Try Abbistar(she will play classic, no beta invite though). She's a ninten-nerd and super duper nice and goofy with her audience. Plays Retail WoW currently.... which I'm not a fan of but she's pretty rad.
---
Otherwise there are hundreds of streamers I've yet to have to to peruse and find :(
---
Hm.. I think it was something I enabled in the options? Only because I don't think I knew what addons were back then as I didn't even  have a bar mod. I also had a priest so it was more helpful to have numbers instead of just a green bar so I could know which spell to heal with.
---
All I see when change discussions come up  is a future pserver catered to those who don’t actually care about the soirit of WoW Classic.
---
If someone wants it tuned differently, take what Blizzard gives and tune it on a pserver.
---
Total waste of a soulstone in a raiding scenario
---
just if there is 4 party members in range and fewer than 5 mobs
---
Times were tough..
---
It will be very easy compared to solo.  Warriors shine when they have support.
---
will australians get their servers? hopefully yes but if not which timezone and ping is better for oceanic region
---
what classic definitely needs is some class rebalancing
---
I never movwd them, i corrected your misrepresentation of what I said.
---
When i'm buffing people i always try to give them what they need, so have a nice downvote.
---
In classis my favorite streamer is Savix.
---
It was a bloody joke.  The people going on about it are the ones "missing the point entirely."  People make it out to be something it isn't - like you claiming it's "arrogant" - in order to pretend they're somehow victims.
---
FFS, if the people bitching about it were held accountable about everything they post and people could take small snippets to claim someone's "shitty" or "arrogant" or whatever, every one of those people would be absolutely destroyed.  But God forbid some guy make a cheeky comment as a kind of joke in a setting that's meant to feel less official than a stale, boring press conference.
---
Nothing. The point of Classic is to replicate an experience as close to Vanilla as possible.
---
Vanilla wasn't perfect and yes many great QoL improvements have been added over the years, but in my personal opinion they need to be left outside of Classic.
---
I can understand the want for certain QoL improvements as we have all become accustomed to them, but a lot of people are looking forward to Classic because it lacks many features we have become used to.
---
Warrior. Great raid DPS, pretty good at PvP especially with a healer, and the best Tank.
---
Personality
---
Guess someone said it for me already, lock thread, cheers.
---
I buff pets with this, too. Gotta make friendly with them spiders! Cute little buggers.
---
Stance dancing is just about the least hard part of tanking in vanilla. Pulling correctly and holding aggro are both much more stressful and difficult.
---
This hits hard.... I'm not mad at you non US players... but fuck lol. I really really hope we are over hyping how much of an impact streamers and their cult followings are going to have :(
---
I enjoy watching Stormx.
---
Hahaha hope thats actually zunniyaki big commedian
---
Take engineering. Explosives solve a lot of problems.
---
Posted my Coldridge Valley (Dwarf/Gnome) speedrun the other day, and some people have been asking for a human and nightelf guide. I managed to make one for humans this morning. I'm going to work on the night elf guide right now.  
---
Plans after night elf guide: Make a 1-5 guide for the hordes aswell.
---
Enjoy! :)
---
In lebanon we lpayed wow vanilla at the time on 3k ping :P
---
800 was amazing at the time we would be over the moon.
---
However it seems like it worked differently back then because even at 3k it was playable to a degree (as in leveling only).
---
800 was quite playable for any activity, except 40 man raids where you would dc.
---
right now if ping goes above 150 people start blinking around you.
---
Can you repost the last image in the album? It says it’s unavailable for me now
---
Don’t forget if any noob DPS stand in front of the boss, they’re going to hurt the tank so much more.
---
[Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker] [Dirge]
---
“Here’s what I want on my pserver.”
---
No it's not. The only thing holding your raid back will be the tanks ability to generate threat.
---
Kevin Jordan is one of the original three Vanilla game designers. He did a vast majority of the work on class design throughout Vanilla and was responsible for fighting for a lot of the design choices that made Vanilla as a whole the game we love.
---
he walks on water too?????
---
I had a similar issue when I logged out in Darkshore. All of my other characters were at a graveyard, my hunter was lost in the void for a little bit.
---
there are a lot but there are no, or very few, big name streamers in eu. certainly none that is big enough to make an impact on a server population.
---
That isn't even true man and you know it, he has been consistently been playing 12-16 hours a day levelling engineering and farming his own gear. The most i've seen him get from other players is a few FAP's and other pots. You can even check his VODs if you'd like.
---
I like Payo
---
That’s true, but the guy you’re responding to is talking about feint vs no feint
---
nixxiom is from EU ????
---
If in 3 years time people still want to keep running the same dungeons over and over I'll be very surprised. I'd sooner take new content and paths than the gaming moving on to TBC.
---
Look at ZG and AQ20, great examples of how content can be added that isn't super high on power levels. There's plenty of ways to add more without it breaking the system. Plus by the time we reach the end of Vanilla's life cycle, I'm sure no one is going to complain if they offered new classic adventures just because it might alter progress everyone has already done?
---
Luxthos.
---
The tanks might very well get more rage since bosses will probably be doing more white damage  it might eaven wary between bosses
---
Downvoted for using retarded as an insult.
---
You also take more damage from the parryhaste, making it harder to pull off for healers, especially DW fury tanking. You’re probably right, but we’ll have to see.
---
Payo, really good rogue and extremely funny to watch
---
What is the recommended dungeon progression path for a brand new 60?  Something like Mauradon &gt; BRD &gt; LBRS &gt; UBRS?  Where does Schol and Stratholme fit in?
---
&gt;Casuals always existed
---
It's hard to talk about casuals since everyone has a different definition. Some use it to describe bad players, others to describe people with little time, others to describe people who don't take gaming serious to any degree (not a primary or secondary hobby). I don't even think I use it in a consistent manner - depending on the context of the conversation. 
---
The fact that I did not even use that term makes it kinda hard for me to discern what point you are trying to make in relation to my post. Would you mind clearing that up?
---
Go rogue
---
steamer doing it = cheating.
---
the game above making the analogy to the rich, does not notice that he is making an analogy to socialism where people want to all have the same reward for wildly different time and hard work invested.
---
Just pay it forward by helping someone who pulled one to many mobs.
---
They are all super casual players though. Only good EU streamers are some high rated arena guys or the hardcore raiders. They don't have that large communities though.
---
&gt; The path is available to every player. Not cheating.
---
The capacity for murdering someone is available to everyone, so murder is *just fine*, you say?
---
You give us the best tank class in the game, my friend.
---
That is all the thanks we need.
---
Played a rogue to 59. Ive literally never landed an eviscerate in my life.
---
Warrior for sure
---
How do you do that? If you make it too useful it will be broken and overpowered, if you make it not useful enough people won’t consider it worth their time.
---
I made a /thank macro just for that (im a hunter)
---
&gt; I think going into tbc and later on wrath would be stupid 
---
Unless you're someone who wants TBC, which is an enormous percentage of the Classic population and includes people who aren't even bothering with vanilla but will join for TBC. If Classic succeeds, TBC is almost inevitable, and they also cannot remove the vanilla experience because people will just ask for it back. Transfers to BC servers will be the path Blizzard takes. Whether or not there's new vanilla stuff at any point, who knows.
---
Harder for the tank to land hits and make threat. Tank takes more damage due to parryhaste. DPS in top guilds are more limited due to threat problems.
---
:P no he's making fun of the idiots saying that a streamer playing 15+ hours per day for the past 2 weeks and therefore owning all BiS, enchants, engineering, etc, is unfair to the rest.
---
Thijmen is a Dutch name
---
I agree, as long as they dont start adding insane mobility to everyone and keep classes sort of unbalanced and definetely NOT focused on raiding, imo that's  a key reason that made classes so boring today.. the extreme focus on raiding rotations and numbers.
---
That's what really keeps me away from classic. I love the world and adventureing but to be stuck with a two button rotation and classes, that are only worth one spec is too much
---
&gt;  I'm saying it should be equal   
---
&gt; They could make them somewhat equal 
---
the priest
---
shaman don't heal in pvp and troll is a bad race
---
Sounds like something Esfands second reddit alt would say
---
wtf? This does not look like orgrimmar
---
Worst thing blizzard did was remove buffs, it helped you feel part of the group
---
Yeah cant wait to slaughter all the alliance scum
---
I'm not going to, but thanks for understanding!
---
End of server. P. Much tradition.
---
Hey look that's me! I'm the druid that got stuck as a whisp. This was amazing, Omar actually showing up made it even better.
---
Fortnite is not at all comparable. Fortnite was in development for a long time and was floundering and slapped on a Battle Royale mode after PUBG was massively successful and then released it, Fortnite became popular because of the Battle Royale mode, hardly anyone cares about the other aspect of the game. 
---
PVE and PVP coexisted the moment PVP servers were released in WoW on day 1! Arena did not and trying to make PVP this super competitive thing was something different, and adding different stats to make PVE gear weaker in PVP and fragmenting the community in the way they did probably had adverse effects on the game.
---
Female Tauren have a smaller hitbox anyway than the Males i understand?
---
This is anot about changes or no changes. The core values of Vanilla must stay. The content, art, etc, from expansions can stay, but no lvl cap increase BS, no gear power creep, no flying mounts, lfd, lfg, etc.
---
I want to play Classic for 2 years...but I want a CONTINUATION of it...and it is not TBC and Wrath.
---
It's Classic+, and that Classic+ will be the way that Blizzard will go, because there is a precedent that PROVED that NEW content, while keeping the core fundamentals intact, WORKS better : OSRS.
---
It is better for Blizzard and for the players to have Classic+, and not TBC.
---
With all the pluses of TBC, there were TOO MANY minuses, and TBC will simply kill Classic...half the people will play TBC, the other half will simply quit Classic.
---
Wanna keep them BOTH, and ADD new players : deliver Classic+.
---
Or WoW 2 built on Classic game design philosophy.
---
Either way, TBC should not be considered by Blizzard (and they probably aren't consider it).
---
Why are you so against TBC? Many people want TBC just as many people want vanilla. Why can’t we have both rather than making vanilla into something it never was, and potentially ruining it altogether? It took this long to get vanilla, do you really want them to risk fucking it up by attempting to make new content?
---
I like to play support characters i'm gonna heal but I want to feel like i'm actually supporting more than just spamming heals on the tanks. I think paladin is my choice but I kinda wanted to play Horde haha.
---
Man it's gonna be fine. Just make sure to join a decent guild and filter out the chat channels that bothers you.
---
Are you saying the way how Sodappopin is currently playing in WoW is the same way is playing on online-casinos?
---
Chuck Norris doesn't get ganked in Stranglethorn; gankers get strangled by Chuck Norris.
---
3 months away. Not 2
---
Phase 2 is Dire Maul. Phase 3 is BWL
---
Yeah no. I'm out should they drop BC. Vanilla was by far the best WoW.
---
BC added the dreaded daily quests, which felt like a chore. It added "heroic" dungeons, which were absolutely unnecessary and were just a way to inflate content. It startet making itemlevels worth more than actual cool stats. BC also added 25-man raids instead of 40-man. It made the entirety of the classic content completely worthless, which still hurts my heart.
---
LBRS, Scholo and Strat are all around the same sort of level. If you can do one you can do them all. You get quests for them at different points, and the Scarlet side of Strat is usually done before the Undead side of strat.
---
You can enter those before 60 but it's generally better and easier to wait to 60 to go in unless you're really struggling for quests. Gear up as much as you can from Blackrock Depths plus high end 55-60 outdoor quests first, then hop in to LBRS/Strat/Scholo any point from 58 onwards really.
---
UBRS is the hardest and is for more than 5 people so whilst you CAN go early on it's generally better to at least have some okayish 60 starter gear before you hit it.
---
\&gt; i am that special flake who doesn't want to play what everyone does 
---
Cool, but, you're going to see a lot of Rogues and Priests. A LOT. To be fair you can only be but so unique in this game. Warriors, Mages, and Rogues are by far the most commonly picked class though. If you wanna be 'special' then go Druid or Shaman. FYI still fantastic classes and absolutely have their place in the game. Dat Windfury though &lt;3
---
Old Hillsbrad Foothills and Loch Moran are definitely sights worthing seeing.
---
Next time please make a one minute appearance on the other layers. It would boost morale a lot.
---
Well it'd probably still be better ping than actual Vanilla so it's certainly an option. One concern might be whether your play schedule is in sync with EU players. Although if you're farming, it'd work in your favor.
---
„Double the price of mounts“
---
that would lead to paladins being born rich.
---
are you high bro
---
Chill personalities: Krendor/Madseason
---
Knowledgeable: Esfand
---
Skilled: Venruki
---
Upbeat/funny: Guzu/Payo 
---
Special mention: Kevin Jordan (Vanilla WoW class designer) is an amazing listen and he recently started streaming the beta. Imagine watching the guy responsible for designing all your favorite classes play the game you love.
---
tbh, I'd play on Preach's server -- his fanbase is chock full of sweet people
---
Wrong. Very wrong.
---
1. More classes able to tank.
---
2. Heroic 5Man Dungeons (not raids), if dungeons stay far from become an aoe fest.
---
3. Really challenging 5Man dungeons achievements.
---
Ulduar was originally planned as a separate continent, similar to Northrend
---
Imagine imagining imagination.
---
Warrior: the best tank spec, and 2 of the best DPS specs
---
Mage: all 3 specs viable in almost all content, besides fire in Mc and bwl.
---
Priest: both healing specs are very good, holy being the staple healer and disc being really useful in raids. Shadow melts faces in PvP.
---
Yes, Classic have 2-3 years of content, and people will spend those 2-3 years, even if they just talk shit in gchat and trade for the last year....AS LONG as they know that something NEW (not TBC) is coming after those 2-3 years of Classic.
---
If being useful to your group is a big deal to you, bringing healthstones, soulstone and summons to a group is invaluable. Rogues are great for solo play and quick kills or stunlocking, but don't offer as much in group pvp as a Warlock or a hunter. I would only choose rogue if having stealth is majorly important to you and being able to pick your fights more often.
---
Spammable CC such as fear is a pain to deal with for a multitude of classes. You won't have any issues soloing stuff as a Warlock either, they are are a top dog class in 1.12. If you have some kind of affiliation to Death/Shadowy stuff like with your DK and you are OK with DoT specs being the most widely used PvP specs, then Warlock is a good choice.
---
As for Hunter, you can be a very annoying force to deal with in pvp with frost traps, kiting capabilities, scatter shot and conc shot stuns. Honestly a good hunter in pvp is ridiculously annoying to face and with good gear you will destroy leather or cloth classes. Revealing stealthers with Mark or Flare is great utility. If you are a good PvPer then Hunter is a strong class with a good amount of outplay opportunities.
---
Oh wow, and guess how much shit he gets for free. fucking moron.
---
A cobra once bit Chuck Norris. After three days of excruciating pain, the cobra died.
---
If you're subscribed and have checked the appropriate boxes, you have some (probably extremely small) chance of getting invited to the official beta and a slightly less small chance of getting invited to stress tests. 
---
If you want to play now, there are private servers you can go to, though this is of course illegal.
---
I think TBC is a decent showcase of fixing the classes, without changing them too much.
---
Because I absolutely loved TBC and view it as a better game than Vanilla.  And that’s saying a lot because I fucking love Vanilla.
---
For me Classic represents Vanilla —&gt; first half of WotLK.  They added dungeon finder in the T9 patch, and that was the true sundering of the game that marks the difference in eras of Classic WoW and Modern WoW.
---
My memory tells me there was status text on party back in Vanilla, but I have doubts whether or not it was an addon.
---
On current 1.12.1 private servers it's not possible to see status text on party.
---
&gt;Fortnite is not at all comparable.
---
Yes it is, I just did.
---
&gt;hardly anyone cares about the other aspect of the game.
---
Ohhh, so your response to an appeal to tradition being a bad take is, an argument to the people. 
---
&gt;probably had adverse effects on the game.
---
Ok dude, I can make baseless claims too. They probably didn't.
---
Well technically 2 months and 27 days.
---
In terms of what route has the most lore... I'd probably say Elwynn, Westfall, Duskwood, Wetlands, Dustwallow for the defias story from levels 1-30 or so. It then resumes around level 50 when you hit the Burning Steppes and finishes with the Onyxia raid.
---
Tarren mill*
---
No, I just know what words mean, bruh
---
I've played this game since launch day and still don't understand why linking Thunderfury is funny.
---
I would rather them skip tbc and go straight to wotlk without changing max level
---
Going holy is a good alternative around lvl 57-ish because by then you can heal all the instances to farm your pre-raid BiS items.
---
Chuck Norris went skydiving only once. He decided one Cataclysm was enough.
---
Last one to link [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker] gets 10,000 gold.
---
This makes me wonder where Kungen is.
---
It's because I really don't care about the world of Vanilla WoW, I care about the design philosophy. When I see people getting stuck in the past of what they didn't like, I can't help but think that they should focus on how it could've been if Blizzard had stuck to the design philosophy most of us fell in love with.
---
Instead of it being stronger, it can be a story line that makes your character a hero for giving something up to help assisting with a threat in that expansion.
---
For instance, in Outlands you could meet with the Demon hunters and you slowly built to the conclusion where you either join them (by becoming a Demon hunter) or assisting them (staying the same class, maybe get a good item reward?).
---
It could also work like this: the hero classes are locked for the first few months and the only way you can get them is by "sacrificing" your character and then after those months opening it up to everyone, but having to level it from scratch. Maybe have limitations, like a fresh Demon hunter has to be an elf, but a sacrificed one can be any race.
---
McCool EZ
---
They do but their fanbase and they themselves are no where near as toxic in game. I.e they don't delete needed items just for the lolz of their viewers which then causes the viewers to think it's funny and do it too.
---
Well back in vanilla, druid made up the lowest % of the player base...  which goes to show how rare they were considering paladins and shamans were faction specific!
---
It was only 1 guy who said the you think you do meme, it wasnt a company stance, pretty much their stance is always "if it will make us money so be it"
---
Not that difficult, just get them on some easy access keybinds and it'll become 2nd nature before you get round to any tanking.
---
Wowhead isn't wrong.. It is pulling from data-mining the current beta client which is called patch 1.13.
---
Oh, idk, I feel like we've done a good job in constructive feedback for Classic.
---
Over 1,000,000 people play World of Warcraft, because Chuck Norris allows them to.
---
Downvoted for using special needs as a negative thing. There are plenty of people out there who experience all sorts of mental states.
---
I think one big thing is never losing that “1 of many” feel that vanilla has. As the game expanded, your character became more important. You can’t be the commander of your factions forces, while millions of other people also are. Vanilla did a great job at making you feel like you were one of the units in the RTS games, not the big hero.
---
That is fair enough, but it being a no from you does not invalidate it. I remember knowing all the set bonuses in vanilla, tbc etc.
---
Fair enough &lt;3
---
It doesn't bother me whatsoever. I have a group of people I'll be playing with and we don't get caught up on tiny things like this. I was saying this to people who do.
---
It seems the current BFA macro system is what works, so you cannot have more than one skill on the global cooldown in it.
---
The main thing you want to do as a warrior is macro startattack into most skills.   
---
    #showtooltip
---
    /startattack
---
    /use SKILLNAME
---
Is the default. You can do cool things with checking what stance you're in so a button could do Intercept if in Zerk stance or Charge if in Battlestance, and you can do skills that swap stances (eg, if battle stance -&gt; thunderclap, otherwise swap to battlestance).
---
In most cases though you just get more control by having every skill separate, provided you have enough comfy keybinds.
---
I wouldn't say that's completely true. It's not like any class are using a majority of their abilities during most encounters anyway. Some of them have niche uses for sure, but that's also the case for Priests.
---
Pro tip. Make use of Mind Soothe whenever you can. It's a brilliant spell.
---
You missed the hours, minutes and seconds “Mr.Technically”
---
Which can Till happen if they are already holding half the stuff anyways?
---
Where did you hear that
---
I did on private servers.
---
I don't even think taking the results somewhat seriously, while taking them with a grain of salt, is a problem. They could help you understand yourself better and maybe even make better decisions in the future, based on your better understanding of yourself.
---
Personally, I am rather introspective already, so these kinds of test don't offer me much new information. Maybe something to add to what I have already perceived myself or it puts something I already believe to be the case into words in a way to make it easier to grasp.
---
Anyways, excusing ones own (bad) behavior with "that's just who I am" is bullshit even if the test result would represent ones personality 100 %. Everyone can change if they want to. Nobody is trapped within their own personality, if anything: understanding personal shortcomings better should make it easier to avoid certain behavior in the future. Making excuses is just lazy.
---
Someone's testy.
---
This is not even naxx..
---
I dont even.....
---
Yeah he's the only "content maker" I would really make time for.
---
I see what you did there
---
so you think equal and identical are the same thing...?
---
So if he farmed all the gear himself, levelled engineering and mining himself including the mats. What else would he be getting on top of that which would be considered in your words "cheating"? The VOD's are there man, he didn't just sit there afk in all of his 16+ hour streams in the past 2 weeks.
---
and less at the same time
---
If you want immersion you should not be following a guide. If you want to explore new areas then go do it. It is much more interesting if you do not know what you are going to find.
---
Ok? I'm not sure what point you're trying to make. They didn't spawn anything for Horde until they did the Hogger thing for both sides. While Omar was flying, super sizing himself and partying with the Alliance the Horde was spamming trade chat begging for a GM to show up and do something cool with us. They didn't.
---
It's really not a big deal but it definitely wasn't equal treatment lol.
---
Genuine question for Human Warrior mains:
---
What's it like to pick the most boring possible class race combo?
---
I'll have to give it a look tonight, thank you
---
Right. However my point still stands. It won't be that bad and if it for some reason becomes too much at one time or another it's very easy to filter out.
---
Most people are older and somewhat more mature. Overall it's gonna be a pleasant experience as long as you stay away from the realms of the big streamers.
---
I always love the thought behind it even if I'm not about to have a swim!
---
Wow on launch had more bugs that had no positive outcome than other way around. Probably like a couple % of bugs are "authentic" features.
---
As a used to be streamer it's absolutely true, and you're a liar if you say you don't accept gifts from viewers. Even my 2k follower ass had endless fucking gifts in the mailbox, so much so I didn't actually need anything at all. Bags, greens that I could throw on at 5, gold, mats. It's crazy tbh how people go out of their way to give good stuff up to streamers.
---
http://www.wowclassicbis.com
---
I'd rather feel attached to my mount and lose 1 bagspace than have it be a meaningless skin dude. Your gonna be bothered a lot in vanilla with this attitude, as there are so many items that take a permanent bag slot: hearthstone, profession tools (skinning knife, engineering spanner etc), off spec gear, trinkets etc. You gonna put them all in some scrapbook? No go from me.
---
Fuck what everyone else is saying. Arms is not the only spec. Explore and try out different builds. And you already see the downside to builds like this; a tradeoff of dps for cc. Nothing wrong with it. As a warrior you still have a good baseline of dps and a solid kit. A good player could make it work. Shield block is incredibly strong. In the right hands you can mitigate your opponents strongest attack or negate strong cc's that also deal damage like gouge, or even hunters scattershot. 
---
The warrior has a lot of flexibility when it comes to playstyle. Explore and experiment. Dont let others tell you otherwise.
---
It's possible. The fact that we have streamers to advocate it now (which simply was not a thing during classic) may bring and keep a lot of people as well.
---
But that's all speculation. We'll have to wait and see.
---
Day 1 the servers will absolutely be exploding from how many people want to try it out, but to get an honest feel for how successful it will be long term we'll have to wait and see how many of these people are left after at least a couple months in.
---
I hope you're right dude, but I cannot just take you by your word ;)
---
Good explanation, worth mentioning is that your layer will most likely not be limited to ppl that are in your vicinity but will most likely be determined when you log in there might for example be 1999 alliance players on your layer and 1 hord tho this is werry unlikely. Alsow there should only be 2 ways of jumping layer one is getting an invite from another layer and 2 relogging into the game
---
It breaks my heart when someone buffs me AND my pet, and i cant give anything back but a /thanks.
---
Some started in TBC and never played Vanilla, so they consider TBC better...even if they haven't played Vanilla.Other people don't trust Blizzard to deliver 1.13 without fucking it up, like BfA.
---
Some others are simply jumping on the badwagon, because they feel like they belong to the majority (it no longer is btw - TBC support dropped like a rock in the last years, and now it's more like 50-50 between TBC and 1.13 supporters).
---
ALL streamers advocated for TBC...no wonder, since they basically started the game in TBC (TipsOut, StaySafe), or play a spec that was crap in vanilla but damn good in TBC (Esfand). Asmongold also supported TBC...but he is not really pondering that, and it's leaning more towards 1.13, but with conditions.
---
And those streamers influenced a lot of people, subjectively.
---
I now see, more than one year after Classic was announced, that 1.13 is gaining solid ground vs TBC, and people are really starting to realize that, as much as they love TBC or Wrath, the answer for a LONG TERM CLASSIC game is 1.13...not a repeat of TBC and Wrath.
---
I enjoy soupasoka, although he is a yt not a streamer
---
I think if they made new sets with similar stats that encouraged new builds sort of like how games like the division or path of exile have numerous weird as fuck items that you can make really odd but cool and effective builds. Give people the freedom to experiment while enhancing the talent system from the expansions that'd be sweet as fuck.
---
We do but they're way smaller and they're mostly English speaking. If you play on German, French, Italian, Spanish or Russian servers, you won't have any problem with Streamers at all. But who knows what will happen once classic launches, maybe some of our big YouTubers or Twitchers start streaming. I doubt it'll be as bad as in the US though.
---
No, retard. How in the hell could you be so fucking far off?
---
A healthstone is as good as a wedding ring.
---
I enjoy watching Preach, Frostadamus, Venruki and Crendor.
---
NA streamers have North America gamers population plus whole Latin America whose has not problem watching streams in english, in EU however, you are basically counting with the gamers in your country (unless you stream in english and that will never be the same as streaming in your native language).
---
You realise how much easier it is to just google it, right? Just put "38.5 c to f"
---
Ironforge was incredible to see in its own right. I’m really excited for it to actually be populated again in Classic.
---
We already have timewalking.
---
Do the reverse.  Take the BEST of the later expansion content - dungeons and raids - and bring them down to level 60.
---
Yeah and dear god do i love to see it. Most every day theres a new youtube video from some streamer being like ''hey huh this classic thing is awesome, i was wrong lol'', and it warms my heart. I love people enjoying the game i adore. That only makes me want to guard it all the more from the trappings of all this hype.
---
No lol he’s from Charlotte, North Carolina.
---
&gt; Every system in existence probably
---
Lol.
---
It’s not about a computer recognising bugs, you log actions and events so when someone complains of an issue you can go and check the logs without them having to do anything more than give a description and rough time period.

I’m a software engineer at one the largest banks in the world, we have all kinds of monitoring tools. Surprised a company like Blizz doesn’t have something like this. I would have thought a game like WoW would at least have some local logs stored and wiped after a set period of time, so a user can upload their logs if something occurs.
---
Just get another druid to buff you imp thorns?
---
I’m just enjoying all the classic content I can watch, and I’m loving how they are all happy and excited to be playing the game we all love. They (all the ones I have seen so far) are all having fun again, they are all smiling and really enjoying themselves, which for me is by far the best part about all the streams. But if I had to make a life and death choice for just one streamer, it would have to be Preach.
---
I remember that one!! I played alliance and thought that chain heal pentagon was the coolest thing
---
Go horizontal, ideally.
---
Don't make raid gear much more powerful than Naxx (or w/e the first raid after it is) but add dungeon and new raid gear that provides the resistances needed for other new content, and maybe even gear for specs that have really bad itemization.
---
That way there is always new gear to get to do the new content + help out specs that need it, without making people into absolute monsters of gear would keep getting stronger.
---
That's what's been bouncing around my skull anyway.
---
Scholo and Strat: UD are on the same tier as LBRS, Strat:Live is easier.
---
I don't have access to a beta to verify, but I want to say that /ty is an alias for /thank
---
Fear Ward masterrace
---
The key is keeping the gear at naxx levels or lower but with more fun options for hybrid specs. Hopefully they're smart enough to do that. The big guilds will clear everything anyway for the sheer thrill of it.
---
Fair enough. That does seem quite problematic, good thing we have a beta!
---
Just torrent it...
---
&gt; It's like putting a diamond in a pile of dirt and say that it's all the same.
---
That's very subjective, though?
---
&gt;August 27th, 2019 will be a massive wake up call for Blizzard and all other MMO gaming companies.
---
Hardly. A company would have to consist of utter morons to gauge success by first day trials.
---
Just look at BfA's start and where it is now. 
---
Sure you can say "but we KNOW classic is good"
---
Well YOU do. The VAST MAJORITY of people who are going to log in when it launches have never played classic before.
---
I’ve done plenty of playing. Hated hunter, loved mage. It’s not “beyond tier 2 only”, you start getting outclassed in BWL. But even if it weren’t true until post BWL, why play a class that gets comparatively WORSE in the second half of the end-game?
---
He has zero wait time for anything and he is given an infinite supply of anything he needs from his 12 year old fans. Fanboi elsewhere kiddo.
---
well you can invite them and then shout at them lmao
---
I think he was letting the priest get the first hit as to not steal it.  Since the mob technically engaged the priest etiquette says the priest should get the kill.  Ended too soon.
---
Why would they need nostalrius code?
---
Anal [Purge]
---
I'm worried I'm gonna burn myself out, but I still have that itch so I started on a THC server.
---
Idk y'ull have to ask undead rogues.
---
why would you wanna do that it is just stupid. time zone differnce plus high ping all the time. and you need a different sub aswell.
---
Yes mate, my words, if you bring something, then its OK. Enhancement shaman brings literally nothing to raid environment. People who plays it in raid and justify that spec are fucking blind.
---
Just add the content of TBC which plays in classic, skip outland and add the class balance and talents from tbc
---
Anyone mathy know how much of a difference racial skill bonuses make to fury dps in raids? Additionally, are those extra skill levels still as relevant when your warrior has edgemaster's handguards?
---
Yeah I guess this is all cool and stuff but I just want the game how is was in 2005 and I’m pretty sure everybody else feels the same, blame Blizzard for not making your class fantasies as epic as you desire because tbh that’s what the retail game is for. The reason everybody is stuck in the past is because when you create a game with deadlines you aren’t allowed to fully develop new and exciting worlds, Activision knows how to manipulate capitalism and that’s why the current game is developed based on played time and not on fun time.
---
I’m not blaming capitalism on why current WoW sucks, but it’s why I don’t want anything new in classic, the employees working on WoW today are not the same ones working on the game in 2005, therefore I do not trust current activision blizzard to be able to recreate an incredible experience due to the fact that I’ve lived through WoD and BFA, and I’d rather they left the game I loved alone to be preserved.
---
free mount at level 40 doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things. lock mount at 60 is inferior to normal epic mount (it uses mana).
---
won't argue with ez leveling.
---
anyways id go priest. you can mind control people in blackrock mountain, dispel world buffs, have lots of friends without trying. whats not to love.
---
In a video game? Yes. All bets are off.
---
Ah, sorry. phase three my bad
---
Its not nearly as bad as people make it. Get a swing timer and your golden. Hamstring kite to dip in and out to hit with autos in between swings. Rend on occasion or herioc strike depending on the mob and their hp. Hs can be more beneficial as its more upfront damage and could make some mobs run making you take less damage overall. Bandages are a must. 
---
As for rogues in particular, they have a major advantage by being able to stealth and having strong single target cc. This gives them an advantage over most other classes with stealth alone. Being able to avoid combat can save a lot of time.
---
He’s already in the layer since he’s in the same chat channel. Layers have separate chat channels from what I’ve seen
---
Have you seen the how the tier sets looks on a troll Male? I'd go tauren just to avoid it
---
I think you can't learn new weapons before lvl 10
---
You are wrong, the biggest player base, outside of china, is EU
---
Be toxic somewhere else, your opinion is invalid to most people if you can't argue without throwing around insults.
---
I've been learning auto chess. Good time killer.
---
Asmongold has said on stream a few times that he will not be taking large amounts of gold and valuable items for free during his time playing classic. He said he wants it to be authentic as possible and getting everything for free isn’t fun. I’m sure most dedicated WoW streamers will do the same but of course some won’t.
---
Anal [ Last Stand ]
---
&gt; Ah I simply cannot wait to recreate my warlock and dot up some noobs from the rooftop in Ratchet. 
---
This made me chuckle. Indeed.
---
When I'm playing a non-buffing class, it kills me that a) I am usually running and/or fighting a mob when this occurs and b) I have nothing to share.  And I usually can't catch their name to send them a whisper of thanks.
---
So I create a macro that /yells "HEY, TYVM for the buff!"  That cover about all of the buffs, including Lock Unending Breath.
---
Protip:  If you wanna buff back, and if you've got bag space, buff your favourite healer in a low-level dungeon with a spirit or int scroll.  Especially just before a boss fight.
---
You didn't answer the question lol
---
Asmongold is an absolute sperglord.
---
Venruki, Staysafe, and Esfand (even though he teams with Asmon alot) are pretty good to watch. Perpelexity has good content and even though I dont watch Frostadamus his YT videos are pretty good.
---
They can trade you healthstones or if they’re feeling particularly generous even soulstone you. Don’t accept second best!
---
Your mindset is what's wrong with a whole lot of this world. "I've got mine, screw the rest, they can have the scraps.". You want Classic, it's your favorite. You got it. Some other people prefer TBC, and those people assisted you in asking for Classic servers, because that's the only way TBC could be re-released as well. Why don't you return the favor, accept that different people want different things, and help them get it?
---
You're selfish, nothing else. Maybe reflect on that.
---
just to make sure we're not using bad figures. It's 5% it's gonna be a lot more than 100 hp
---
Perfect. Thank you very much!!
---
Have an updoot for updoot
---
Fuckin e$fand
---
Because your question was irrelevant. lol
---
No, I think he said "equal" and then said "almost equal". That's two different things. That's called moving goalposts, because then the person you're moving them for has to reevaluate what they're saying based on what's changed. About as engaging as talking to a wall.
---
You didn't have to edit out the "pedantic dick" part, I'm not sensitive, and it's not pedantic if it changes the entire argument.
---
I honestly can't tell if you're serious about that.
---
What a strange hill to choose to die on.  This is the sort of blind zealotry that gives the #nochanges side a bad name.
---
Please, seek help.
---
You can read the BFA guide and try to adapt old macros with the new system because classic uses the new macro engine.
---
https://www.wowhead.com/making-a-macro-commands-modifiers-warcraft-guide
---
Why increase lvl cap and why the hell do you think people CARE about lvl cap increase?
---
A lvl 60 Naxx geared player will beat the shit out of a lvl 70 green/blue geared player. You don't NEED lvl cap increase to provide players will POWER.
---
It's not even about that in Classic. Who the hell cares if 2 guilds are Naxx geared and 10 guilds are doing BWL, while 20 others are doing MC? Nobody, because Classic provides relevant and fun content to ALL players, regardless of gear or lvl.
---
Lvl cap increase is THE WORST IDEA THAT EVER WAS IMPLEMENTED IN MMOs.
---
And the leather armor seller had BLUE leather boots for rogue / hunter that were awesome!
---
Honestly, I am on the 1.13 wagon as long as they, like... keep the spirit of Classic.
---
StaysafeTV is always a good stream, I haven’t had a bad time watching him since I started. Knowledgeable and funny, and always working towards a weird goal in the beta. He also goes through additional leveling runs instead of just spending 3 days getting a BiS necklace
---
What are you talking about? Hardcore guilds clear everything faster :D Hell we in semi-hc guild were clearing MC, BWL and AQ40 in 1 day - 5hour session. In casual guild you will have a hard time to even clear MC+BWL in three days.
---
Sounds like you're too young to be on reddit. quit violating the ToS and go play with blocks, champ.
---
Private servers are not vanilla.
---
This does not have any place in classic wow, there are already expansions worth of other content you can play
---
I’m referring to the systems I’ve built and worked with at multiple jobs. I currently work for a large bank as a software engineer - something going wrong could cost a fortune.
---
These people all have the wrong end of the stick. It’s not about reporting errors, it’s about logging actions and events so that when someone is reporting a bug (with or without a button that records logs) you can just go and see what the system was doing.
---
All these people are downvoting and commenting as if they know what they’re talking about, saying a computer can’t recognise a bug when they’re missing the point entirely - you report critical information, error or no error, so that if you get unwanted behaviour you can retrace your program’s steps and fix the issue.
---
The hp regen doesn't matter, berserking does
---
How so? This sounds soooo vaguely familiar. It has been a long time tho.
---
The 5% is on base hp, I don't have exact numbers for base hp on a lvl 60 warrior but my guess would be around 2000 which would make that bonus 100hp.
---
You think an abomination that has came back from the grave is more boring than a completely normal non magical human dude?
---
Because some people want TBC? What's so hard to understand about this? They helped you ask for Classic, because they like Classic as well, but prefer TBC. And to get TBC, Classic is a must. So maybe shut the fuck up and return the favor.
---
Doesn't have to be power creep.  Fashion can be it's own endgame.  Instead of transmog, we'd just do horizontal progression for cosmetics.
---
The allure to troll is the increased attack speed for extra threat, not he HP regen.
---
I honestly think the developers don’t have the IQ to implement Classic like extended content. Team is so far down commercial hole, the creativity’s been washed.
---
Early on, its not worth the silver. However, you should make it a goal to get every weapon skill that you can. Leveling can be messy making it hard to determine what item youll get, at what lvl, and where. Sometimes, a random weapon can be too huge of an upgrade not to make use of. Collecting all of your weapon skills earlier rather than later saves you the trouble of getting some item then either never getting the weapon skill training thus never using the weapon and/or spending a good bit of time to get to the city since at higher lvls you will typically be further away from capital cities.
---
The parts that matter. Graphics, Poly count, particles, group size,  etc, are all optimal to be able to run on a 20 year old PC.
---
The client itself is a trivial drop in the bucket.
---
In the most casual guilds, racials don't matter :)
---
Depends on the content.
---
That’s a cool idea
---
A dude defeating magical abominations with his sheer strength and an axe is a lot less boring imo.

Reddit at EU hours is fun.
---
[realm populations for US and EU (sourced)](https://realmpop.com/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) 
---
It’s also confirmed that EU has much less servers so the player density is much higher.
---
There hasn’t been any mention of this in this thread but the best raiding guilds in the world are in EU and that will have significantly more disadvantages than any server with streamers on it.
---
Just a warrior with a flashlight
---
The good 'ol days, ey?
---
Sure but they're not Asmongold :/ Our biggest streamer would be Zerator, and he's around 10-15, maybe on Classic he'll sit on 30k, and that's just one guy who's pretty chill about it, so we're pretty fine imo !
---
&gt;talks like a chud
---
What do you mean?
---
Tbh literally one of my fave parts of old wow, the little details of the community like this! 
---
You better believe anyone I walk by while questing gets MotW 🐮✨
---
I have to imagine once we're closer to launch, Blizzard will start to go after those servers and get them shut down - not like it's difficult to find them.
---
Always!
---
Hope they do, I'd rather them abandon something to make something great again so they definitely learn to take their time
---
Oh boy this brings back memories.

/ty is quicker when running
---
Well, it was a stress test. The whole point was to see how well they could keep the servers running when 1000s of players all try to hit the start zones at once. Hence the level limitation.
---
Yeah, it was somewhat annoying when you were in a layer with a complete circle of players.. Then the world server crashes, and you come back to a ghost town orgrimmar. But, I think having 10,000 players all around you trying to finish the same level 1 quests as you might be more annoying.
---
I only hope that it's something we generally just will not see during normal play.
---
This is incorrect: https://www.wowprogress.com/realms/rank/eu
---
https://www.wowprogress.com/realms/rank/us
---
123  (127?) vs 120 US realms. Just by looking roughly at the population numbers, EU seems to have more players.
---
Your also gonna be down voted for a rambling wall of text that's basically unreadable ranting.
---
If your gonna write an essay, format it a little so it's readable.
---
It's not on base health in vanilla
---
best to worst:
---
dagger &gt; shadow &gt; feral &gt; enhance
---
special level:
---
enhance &gt; feral &gt; shadow &gt; dagger
---
I'd go alliance feral druid. You get to be special and viable, incredible.
---
The Naga could easily just make a portal for them to move. Maybe some of tgem just want to help their BElf allies?
---
They have a safe haven for now but Outland is dieing so it makes sense that they would want to move eventually.
---
You can go for extra threat into the fury talent tree 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
yeah that's pretty lucky haha! We do have the language playing a role here, I'm in Belgium so we'll be on french servers most likely, there's only one big french streamer
---
better way to phrase this, position yourself so that both the Mob, and the Node are in front of your character instead of placing the mob in front and the node behind.
---
It has some streamers but not so big and yeah different languages! UK is english, France Belgium and Luxembourg are french, we have deutsch people, german people, and then spanish, italian, I mean, too spread!
---
2. TBC Launched in 24 Months
---
3. Dual Spec
---
Yes you will have a higher ping :/
---
you can go for more stamina on gear enchants, this argument doesn't really make much sense does it?
---
Would you actually sit there and cheer for blizzard if the made it blizzlike, as you watched the the unending que timer or simply the inability to play for 2-3 days straight as the server was down... would that actually be awesome? Like literally what ???
---
There devs took Legion build as a base, so I think every macro advancement as well as every Lua restriction of said expansion is in place. They've said that they may restrict Lua even more if some addons arise, that replicate heavy QoL features of current live servers, such as LFG.
---
Judging the comments on this thread, at least here it's pretty divided on where Classic should(n't) go. I don't see how a game can be fun when it has the same content forever, but if repetition is your thing all power to you.
---
I'm not trying to insult you, it's great if you can play the same thing over and over and still have fun.
---
Which has nothing to do at all with race and is available to all warriors... the topic is quite literally a discussion on warrior race.
---
God I hated that wall jumping shit in Everbloom. Everybody just assumed you knew your Spiderman shit and would just treat you like a moron if you did not make up the wall on your first try like David Belle. Luckily we had 2-person mounts then so I could just say "fuck this" and hitch a ride on somebody's mammoth/yak/trike. And then watch as they failed the climb...
---
+1 to this!
---
Anal [jokes] are 4th grade material...
---
Always loved it.
---
Hahahaha, did you play vanilla? 
---
I had hour long wait times well after BWL.
---
I edited my post to reflect this after your reply so I apologize for the repetition in my comments, but EU has the best guilds in the world and if you don’t think the things they’re gonna exploit with layering/sharding is worse than having a bunch of streamers running around with annoying viewers than you’ve got another thing coming my man.
---
&gt; Do you think that if Classic turns out to be a success again (and here's to hoping it does) it can pave the way for (a branch of) modern game design back towards "our" (let's just handwave this for the sake of brevity) tastes?
---
Yes. That is my biggest hope for classic. Just look at what Dark Souls did. In a time where difficulty was totally frowned upon, this masterpiece sparked a whole new genre of games that fist their audience's asses for hours and people love it. If classic is successful, I have high hopes for that.
---
I also think it is very (very) realistic that Blizzard will take feedback from classic servers, both of long term players and those who leave eventually, to make changes to retail in areas that turn out to be extremely popular in classic. This is obviously up to the players (stayers and leavers) to leave feedback about what they liked or disliked. If certain things are universally liked (like server communities) I am sure Blizzard will look for ways to reinstate that in the live game.
---
Lastly, and least likely, there is the hope that they build on classic WoW. That they see that there is huge merit in the game and that it is worth it to add content to it. I'd actually cry tears of joy if that ever gets announced. (https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bv47mo/vanilla_team_lead_directors_thoughts_on_how_to/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link would have to be done like this. He got it spot on imho)
---
But I consider this unlikely unless classic wow becomes a storming success (rivaling or overtaking retail). Otherwise they'll likely stick with their announcement not to curate 2 MMOs in parallel. I absolutely hope it happens, though. That would be the greatest moment in gaming history for me.
---
Yeah it’s not on base health in vanilla; it scales with buffs, flasks, gear etc. 
---
But arguably the threat gen argument and health regen still apply.
---
Can sum1 plz INV to _xyz_’s layer?
---
WTS [Lesser Magic Wand], 5000000g
---
damn, you got me.
---
i remember this! closing of vanilla beta was so awesome
---
I'm sure that the idea is that you will be able to play right away. Based on the stress tests, that seems like a goal that will still take some effort to achieve, but I don't think it's outside the realm of possibility for almost everyone to be able to log in on day one.
---
I understand what you mean although I don't completely agree with it. TBC was my first WoW experience. I love it to death. My favourite raids are from TBC, my favourite gear sets are from TBC, etc etc. I really want TBC. But if Blizzard just starts re-releasing the old expansions, in a few years we'll be back in Cata which is when the game started seriously going south for me. Then what? Re-release vanilla again? The person talking to you seem to have a similar worry to mine, which is the future. Vanilla servers won't be populated forever if the content doesn't change, and will eventually go back to the more modern style of WoW if they keep re-releasing expansion after expansion. 
---
I never really played RuneScape but I heard they did something similar to what is happening with Classic now. They released an older version of the game, and keep releasing new content to it and it seems to be doing pretty well right? 
---
In my opinion, it would be cool if they went from Vanilla to TBC and even maybe WotLK, but changing some stuff to keep the game more true to it's Vanilla style. One of them being, not adding flying, or adding it in a different way with some time limit or something. 
---
I don't know, I really want to see TBC but I also don't want to see them just taking the same path with this Classic project like our current retail WoW did.
---
I always liked getting those as a Druid above level 16. Its like, I have seal form but I appreciate the effort kind agent of darkness.
---
Huh, TIL. 
---
Even then, there won’t be enough servers to protect you all from EU raiding guilds so 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
The thing is Omar is on Alliance side and is probably allowed to do pretty much what ge wants. Horde has has their own GMs show up and do stuff and they probably have the ability to do the same as Omar but they may not have thought about it or maybe they dont like that sort of thing.
---
Different GMs will do different things if they have free reigns.
---
[got you covered](www.wowclassiccountdown.com)
---
Buff hunters? :)
---
That's why Tauren hp and warstomp is better than berserking, with alcor sunrazor and only heroic strikes you get threat like a madman 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Got any beta keys left btw?
---
&gt; If you do this then people will just skip the content that they don’t need and find the path of least resistance in order to obtain gear
---
Not if you lock the new content with attunements. As an example, to enter a new Classic raid, with T3.5, the attunement is killing KT in Naxx. 
---
Do that, and the path of the least resistance doesn't exist anymore.
---
You want the BEST gear possible? Sure, just PROVE that you are good enough to ACCESS it. Want T3.5 or T4? Clear T3 content.
---
This is how the things worked in Classic, and will work in 1.13 : You CANT just skip content. It is NOT possible.
---
Imagine a guild...ANY GUILD, trying to do BWL, without doing Ony and MC first. Or going to AQ40 without doing BWL first. Or jumping from BWL to Naxx, and skip AQ40.
---
IT IS JUST IMPOSSIBLE, mathematically, to do it.
---
Same can be done in 1.13. A T3.5 or T4 raid should be IMPOSSIBLE without a good part of the gear to be T3 gear.
---
Ziqo! He is hilarious. check him on youtube if u want an impression
---
nice, I prefer a medium size population server (pvp) so that's good news for me
---
Vanilla launched with a fraction of the population that Classic is going to launch with.
---
It's also quite ridiculous to me that the only classes that people apparently bring into raids are warrior, rogues and mages. Just because they have the best DPS potentional out of all of the classes, that doesnt mean that they ARE the best. As I said in the doc, pretty much only rets spec into Imp. BoM, so those warriors and rogues are quite happy for you. BoM is a huge boost in attack power.
---
But just in general, the only utility aside the buffs that these classes can bring you are the occasional off tanks if the warrior is good at what he is doing, and the curse cleansing (in fights). Compare that to what a paladin offers (it doesnt even have to be holy/prot/ret).
---
In Soviet Russia, Recipe makes YOU !
---
:)
---
You should look up Sonii, he prefers playing pvp. He’s douchey but self aware and kinda funny.
---
You're quite clearly missing the point, but I'll indulge you for a moment.
---
First off, your analogy is deeply flawed. You seem to misunderstand the difference between using a spell against other players that works as **intended**, and abusing/exploiting a bug or mechanic in a way that was  **unintended** to function in that way. 
---
Let's take WSG and the linked twitch clip of this thread as an example. Sitting on the regular roof in WSG is perfectly fine. Why you ask? Because there is a massive path leading up to it, there are no buggy coliders that make you levitate as you walk on it, there is plenty of space to fight on etc. It is quite **self-evident** that it is designed for you to be there - it may give you a slight defensive advantage, but that is how it was designed to be. 
---
On the other hand, abusing glitchy  terrain to reach highly inaccessible areas with the purpose of making it almost impossible to properly mount an assault on your flag carrier is clearly unintended. Why you ask? Because it's very difficult to get there, the colliders are very buggy, and often you find yourself walking on air. It also gives you a ridiculous advantage, where your FC is almost impossible to attack. Most importantly, it is not how the battleground was designed to be played. Terrain exploits like this in a CTF-map like WSG basically turns it into an arms race, where the outcome of the match depends on whose FC can reach the most inaccessible position. These are also the reasons why people have been banned for doing this on live servers.
---
If you can't understand the difference, then I'm afraid you're a lost cause.
---
&gt;I don't understand why people are wanting TBC after waiting so long for classic.
---
I want to finish the raids that I never could in TBC and arena is fun if you roll a right class.
---
Alright, I added a word that wasnt needed, but I used to to try to makke my point that gear doesnt need to be identical, just "as good" as the drops to make crafting your own gear worth it. As it stands now, its a much larger effort to make a piece of gear (go around the world and farm stuff, or buy it off the AH with what little money you have) compared to just running an instance 2-3 times, while the crafted gear is worse.
---
Scholo and Strat are harder than most of the above. Partly because you are required to do more surgical pulls and ranged counterspells etc. I would say a progression in difficulty would be something like:
---
BRD&gt;LBRS&gt;UBRS as OT&gt;Scholo&gt;Strat live&gt;UBRS as MT&gt;Strat UD (since Baron is pretty tough). 
---
Everything depends on the gear/skill of your group though!

As a warrior I'm thankful but die a little inside when the best I can do is /thank or my personal favorite /cheer with a /bow after.
---
I was actually getting my friend into wow classic using a private server to get them ready for what class they wanna play. One of them picked druid and I told him so many times, I don't care if you have to chase them down you better buff everyone in passing.
---
This is real.  I think a lot of people are going to be offput by just how long it takes to get to 60.  We're not all speedrunners.
---
Hi, /u/str8f8
---
Now you have yourself a good argument!
---
Is that something that even needs to be changed? Does adding new levels that players have to grind through change anything?
---
If new players want to pick up the game, then they have to level through the same 1-60 content that everyone else did. Their progression will still be slightly accelerated by new and updated gear introduced to the game, and they will probably end up joining a guild that's further along in progression allowing them to catch up.
---
New content doesn't always have to be top end content; new instances could be added for the 20s, 30s, etc. level ranges.
---
If anything, I think MMO design like classic EverQuest's is more inclusive to newer players because the gear that they pick up while leveling isn't so outrageously outclassed by high end gear. Compared to WoW, just about anything you do or accomplish pre-60 is pointless because everything will be replaced by Outlands content.
---
Warlock is the best duelist in the game.
---
Warlock beats mage in a duel easily.
---
Warlock in T3 is the scariest thing in the entire game.
---
ez
---
&gt; Because classic has no arena and the raids are easy as fuck compared to tbc. 
---
LMAO !
---
Yeah, it took my old guild 2 months to clear BWL...and 3 weeks to clear SSC or TK.
---
What are you smoking? TBC raids were HARD?
---
Jeez...
---
I haven't argued for tauren, I'm just saying what this guy was saying was incorrect
---
Genuine question for you: why do you care what other people play?
---
Competitive players don't really give a shit about cosmetics. That isn't going to keep people interested.
---
You just have to wait 2 some years for tbc and then you are golden. Now for the more serious comment. Yes most professions are pretty meh and a guild needs like one of each crafting profession at 60 (not including engineering) the only two really good professions at all levels are said engineering and alchemy. I still don't want to change it mostly because we are getting a recreation of an old game not a new game. This means we will have to live whit all the bad/early/rushed design decisions made long ago
---
I personally enjoyed the aspects of resilience. Primarily the gearing in WotLK. There was enough choice for PvP gear to build it how you wanted as well as properly rewarding the "better" PvP players with high up rating.
---
Yes it made it so that a PvP main player have an advantage over a raider. But I believe they should. Maxed PvP gear wasnt the best at PvE as well.
---
It rewarded you for doing what you set out to do.
---
Nah, they removed it because they were too lazy to design locations like they did in Icecrown/storm peaks
---
He said on twitter a few weeks ago that he will be playing classic. Not sure if he is gonna go casual or "hardcore". 
---
Spends most of his time ranting on twitter about politics nowadays though.
---
He has the most punchable face I have ever seen in my life.
---
Ele shaman is very strong now in BFA. I main one.
---
It's disturbing that I zoomed in and couldn't find a single gnome.
---
Everyone is worried about power creep. 
---
Makes no sense.
---
Throughout classic, they buffed and de-buffed items.
---
Release new harder raids, but buff some earlier on items. Power creep reduced and will help people progress that are struggling.
---
Not saying every item and a huge increases folks. But just enough.
---
Hard to get education when somebody shoots up your school every week
---
Stop posting streamer trash. Nobody wants to see it.
---
I think all this talk of adding more content to classic is missing the point.  There is already years of content in classic that just hasn't been released yet.  Not to mention that all the raids are not just things people are going to clear in a few weeks.  Not to mention no catch up items for skipping from MC to Naxx.  People that are going to play strictly classic are going to be playing awhile before there is any real need to "add" stuff.
---
So you know, they are one company. They merged. There is no activision there is no blizzard. It’s one entity.
---
Sad but this is what it is
---
Why contain it? Let it spill over into the schools and churches.
---
It’s all bad if we don’t get oce servers, ping will he 300+ at best without. From what iv gathered though, we will be getting our own
---
The mods have been spawning everything over on ally, so all the streamers have been playing ally for the stress test. People watching the streams might roll ally due to this.
---
I'm not opposed to Naga. They already were in both the Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor, right? We saw them there with Illidan. You don't have to make stories and excused to them being there.
---
I don't understand why are you so hooked on the Draenei. You literally keep making up stories to have an excuse for Draenei to be in Azeroth and that's is exactly what I was from the beginning - you have to create a story for it to be a fact because it wasn't a fact prior to WoW... : P
---
A third option for "why ponytail?" is that people like the way it looks - this is a subtely/slightly different take on your #2, but I think it's true for many.
---
As a druid you HAD to make that suicide run. That journey was the best.
---
Generally, in vanilla you will have to eventually go through most of the leveling zones if you dont want to mindlessly grind for exp/gold. Overall, on Alliance side, path would be something like:
---
1-10: you chosen starting are based on race (or not)
---
10-20: Westfall, lochmodan, darkshore
---
20-30: redridge, wetlands, duskwood, ashenvale (if you want pvp) 
---
30-40: hillsbrad, desolace, arathi highlands, stv (if you want pvp)
---
40-50: tanaris, feralas, hinterlands, searing gorge
---
50-60: felwood, ungoro, winterspring
---
You can mix in wpl/epl between 40-60, pretty cool lore wise.
---
Lol wtf. Dude worked to get his character tricked out.
---
Yeah it made me think as well
---
Too many factors to say. Its anyones game out in the world. Stay aware of your surroundings, stay at a good hp, keep consums on yourself, etc. Basically, put yourself in best of a position as you can to where you can handle yourself given a bad situation. This is true with any class. A class without cds/resources/low on health/bad position are more than likely not going to come out alive against any other class. This was more towards pvp  but can be applied to pve easily for the warrior as well. Be prepared, be aware. 
---
As others have said that pulling too many mobs is bad, ill have to say its not as bad for the warrior as so many make it out to be. Warriors have many abilities to get away from the fight. Hamstring to slow, intimating shout to make them run in fear, charge/intercept to cover some ground, demo shout/thunder clap to reduce a groups damage output by a lot...a lot of tools to use. 
---
To specifically answer the most likely thing to kill you during questing is other players. Many other classes will think you are weak and powerless by yourself due to the fiction that well they are worthless in solo pvp. That they 'need' others/healers. So you will be a target to many. But again, being prepared and being aware will keep you alive and surprise your opponents when you kill them.
---
And god damn was the chat spammy. Couldn't say anything. Discovered the /join world2 command though, thanks to someone. This one was safe
---
The only way NOT to ruin Classic, but also keep it alive, is 1.13.
---
TBC will simply destroy Classic servers, half the people will play TBC and the other half will stop playing Classic...because there is no continuation WORTHY of their ideals of a good MMO.
---
Preach is in a top 50 world guild and has a good sized community.
---
&gt;Imagine a guild...ANY GUILD, trying to do BWL, without doing Ony and MC first. Or going to AQ40 without doing BWL first. Or jumping from BWL to Naxx, and skip AQ40.
---
Plenty of people have cleared BWL in full pre-bis even in 2005.
---
If you really want a raid added that requires 40 people to have full t3 or equivalent gear then you’ll be adding what is essentially the item level requirement in the current game, the beauty of vanilla is that tons of items remained relevant way past the point where they were relevant.
---
Also I want you to understand the ramifications of what you’re saying, you want 40 people to raid enough to get full t3 in order to just *attune* for the next raid, are you really willing to raid every week for 8-12 hours for 50 weeks? I welcome the ability to take breaks and resume playing knowing that new content isn’t being added and allows me to play the game how I want.
---
But why do content past Naxx if it doesn’t award better gear?
---
You fight his torturers (coven of shivarra) who are generals in the legion, but then he also has loot and we have an opportunity for more revenge too, so you drop down into his pit where he is a prisoner and kill him too. He isnt of importance he is literally being tortured from above when we get there.
---
It could add some value to a WorldPvP server if there are a lot of streamers: imagine raiding a famous streamer from the other faction. Like: "Hey guys, Soda is in \[insert area/location\]. Let's raid him for the lolz!"
---
That's generally speaking my opinion. 
---
I am impressed how many people see it different
---
Well, that's not totally true. Last stress test they spawned Majordomo in Org and he started teleporting people into MC. It was actually pretty wild. But it definitely seems like Alli has more stuff. Though that may just be due to the fact that it's easy to slip streamers when they witness the cool stuff.
---
Thing is, it was never meant to be in vanilla, which is why they cracked down on it and eventually removed it. Do you think they should start the old server hardware back up so we could have all the familiar lag and bugs from the old game as well?
---
This thread is actually a great example of why this should never happen. If you scroll through this thread, you'll find 150+ comments, each with a separate idea of what was/is good about WoW (and Classic).
---
Classic is an easy win for Blizzard because they can essentially bring it back as it was without having to change anything. They have to update stuff, but they don't have to make any concrete balancing decisions.
---
The second they start adding content, or fixing things, they're opening up Pandora's Box. What content DO they add? What changes DO they make? For every person wanting class balance, there's another equally large group of players that doesn't want it. For every group that wants a few more levels, there's another group adamantly against the idea.
---
Classic should basically stay as it is forever. That's the idea -- it's a living piece of history.
---
I think Blizzard should be open to the idea of future BC, WotLK, etc. servers, but I don't think creating content for Classic is really a smart move.
---
&gt;...you mean "more shards" than realms, right? Otherwise it wouldn't make much sense to "shard" (creating a virtual server), since it'd still compete for the same server resources rather than being able to be offloaded to a different server/cluster?
---
While I'm sure they meant realm, it's "kinda" true for server too. Virtualising a zone into multiple shards on the same physical server isn't as crazy as you think. I don't doubt realm Blizzard servers have similar limitations to those on the emulator cores in terms of where you can safely multithread things.
---
So, if they have one whole continent on a powerful physical server or they have many smaller zone shards virtualised on a powerful super server. The small zone shards would win out in efficiency because you're more effectively spreading the load over different threads.
---
I think this was the problem they were hitting with physical servers. Where, they wanted to bring in all singing all dancing new features, which of course put more load on the world servers while datacentre CPUs if anything were actually getting slower clocks (but more cores). The load needed to be split easily between cores.
---
Also virtualisation means they can actually handle more actual players with less physical hardware by shunting them to an always relatively busy node and not having world servers operating empty for 90% of the time.
---
So it's better for them, and for those on previously dead realms, better for players too (except for farming rare spawns etc).
---
And this is a reason to kill Classic? Because "it's cheaper" or because Blizzrad MIGHT fuck it up?
---
Because make no mistake, without 1.13 in play, TBC will, 100%, kill Classic.
---
Can you really get geared up at any point? Will a guild take you when you are 3-4 lockouts behind and their main tanks and off tanks are already semi-geared? Doesn't make much sense to me.
---
Number of no changes people who think not being able to play the game is a preferable option..
---
This is love.
---
I think that's really going to depend on what phase of the game your talking about, and which parts of the game.  There are many specs that are great for PvP but not For Raids, and certain specs that really shine in one raid but not others.
---
Certain raids, encounters and loot tables added in later phases, change the meta about which specs are viable and which are optimal.
---
Some classes, have only one spec that most would consider the leveling spec.   However leveling is only one part of the game that ends eventually.    Then there are Farming specs,  How you spec to farm your gold may be completely different than how you spec to get gear in dungeons, versus how you spec to get raid spots.
---
2. Buff tier 0 sets so at least a third of the set is BIS pre-MC because I hate clown armour greens and blues from dire maul
---
3. That's it honestly
---
I mean, Rushmore...
---
Classic went on for a very long time, I wouldn't worry about this too much.
---
Because there needs to be a sense of progression.
---
Preach or MadSeasonCow. Both great people I could imagine playing with.
---
Just making Respec not cost 50g.
---
It's the only way.
---
Have Blizzard, one year into Classic, ask players what do they want , TBC or 1.13.
---
Now it's about 50-50. One year into Classic, 1.13 will have over 80%.
---
An expansion that keeps true to and expands on the core values of Vanilla WoW...
---
That would be amazing.
---
I think they would call it "The Burning Crusade"
---
Jokes on you, I'm bringing back Chuck Norris to the Barrens.
---
Because it awards different gear for different playstyles, that’s enough for me
---
N811 or Human Warri for Tanking ?
---
Sure but the same way, if he organizes a raid and you're questing you get shit on, or if you wanna raid the opposite faction the streamer will always have more support, the opposite faction will end up changing servers, and boom 90%/10%
---
Last screenshot is not available. Can u reupload?

Ya there's something to be said about having the real deal at your finger tips
---
You're going to get donwvoted because nobody is going to read this wall of text. Format your texts properly.
---
I've heard the exact amount of boss damage difference vary a bit from the theorycrafters, but you're looking at doing between 5-7% more total damage if you're an Orc/Human using racial bonus over an identically geared warrior of a different race. It's significant.
---
Yes, the skill levels are just as relevant when you have Edgemasters. It's all about reducing glancing blow penalty, and that +5 will always be there. I don't think it's possible to get enough weapon skill to make the racial bonus not worth it.
---
Sadly, if you really do care about minmaxing your pve fury dps, you WILL need to roll human or orc depending on what weapons you feel you'll get access to. BUT you can't ever be sure of getting specific weapon types, and most sensible guilds wont give a crap what race you are.
---
If you're troll fury warrior, just use the excuse "but i can be given all the swords, maces and daggers so the dps gears up quicker".
---
/e snuggles up closely to *target* to show his gratitude
---
Respec costing massive amounts of gold
---
I generally agree with what you said, but the underlying implication that I am one of the "not gonna happen" people is utterly wrong. I pretty clearly stated that I'm one of the people who wrestled in the mud with those people. I believe in classic. I just don't believe that the majority of people in this world have good taste. This sounds dickish, but Popculture is popculture because it is the biggest common denominator. 
---
Retail is mostly dying because it catered to pop-culture, but pop-culture consumers are a volatile audience, they will always do the hot new shit (MMOs, MOBAs and currently Battle Royale) and MMOs are not currently the hot new shit. 
---
&gt;you, will realize, after August 27th, that Classic is the better game...
---
I know that classic is the better game. August 27th is a stupid date to check on that, because the release date will be heavily inflated. Let's check on April 27th, 6 months later, and use that to gauge the succes.
---
Again: I'm not saying you're wrong. I do agree that classic is the better game (never said anything else).
---
All I'm saying is that modern (younger) gamers are used to entirely different shit than us and MAY not like it as much. And you cannot predict that. Neither can I. So we have to wait and see. If classic becomes incredibly successful, that does not mean I was wrong, because I'm not saying it won't be. I'm saying we don't know.
---
But hey I don't want to piss on your parade. I'm happy for you and I hope you're right, with all my heart. There's nothing that would make me happier than classic blowing up so hard that retail gets shut down and classic gets content updates in the spirit of what makes classic classic.
---
&gt;Then have it changed to it fitting a Classic experience?
---
How about NOT having it in the first place?
---
Ah, I see you are a man of culture.
---
Only it will be lined with the bodies of the Alliance!!

How is private server not vanilla? Have you played both to give a me a reason?

I know there are some differences but classic will be more like a pserver than it will be like vanilla.

Also im not saying im a majority, im just denying majority prefer bc over vanilla.

Yep, it's a welcome buff for the wep skill.

So, become a streamer yourselft and try to beat him at his own game. No?
---
If I was a famous streamer and, by my own actions, creates an unbalanced faction forces (ie: 90%/10%), I would take a break or create/play an another character on an another server. But, that would be me, maybe it's because I am not a Millennial and, by the same way, I am not an attention whore. Fanboyism creates always problems.
---
That is all the tanks we need
---
You do realize without layers youd be on a different server right? At least this way you can be invited
---
did not even take mortal strike as i thought at the time that it is a waste since i can just use heroic strike :P i did not realize at the time the difference between instant attack on cast and attack that rely on weapon speed :P

Can't wait to welcome all the new Alliance to our "community" by corpse camping you until you log off. Especially streamers.

No. Common sense man..Every minute of melee combat in all Vanilla videos beg to differ. Nice try though
---
Oh I just noticed that too, is he right clicking to start attacking??
---
And they polled the player base on what they agree or not. A 75% yes would add a change, or implement new content.
---
This can be done in Classic, with a caveat : only players that have lvl 60 characters, cleared at least BWL, and have at least 100 days/played can vote.For PvP changes, ask players with high ranks and enough /played to be relevant for the poll.
---
Simply because they know far better what is GOOD for the game, as opposed to a lvl 40 that started 1 months ago, or a lvl 60 that PuGs MC and pick up herbs in Azshara, or a lvl 52 running like a headless chicken in AV.
---
Asking the ENTIRE player base would be a grave mistake.
---
He's not arguing.  He's just adding his thoughts. He doesn't understand why other people want TBC.
---
Yes yes
---
I'm sorry to hear about your friend. We will level in his/her honor!
---
Personally i'd finish up Teldrassil at around 10-11, maybe do a handful of early Darkshore quests, then make the wetlands run and continue in Westfall so you can get all of the Deadmines stuff prepped and ready.
---
Train staves before you hop over, and then grab the deadmines reward staff. It's always nice to have access to all weapon types if you have the money as you never know when something awesome will drop, but you can easily level to 18-19 using 1h and shield, it's just a bit slower.
---
You don’t think releasing unfinished products to compete with other competitors in the gaming industry and stringing together gameplay elements that have the sole intention of just keeping you playing the game and not actually earning any rewards is manipulation?
---
Sure I guess I could’ve used a better word than capitalism but I don’t give a fuck really, I know being a grammar nazi on reddit is fun and if that’s really all you got out of what I said then sorry.

I am pretty sure I saw vidoes of him playing on online-casino and getting help by the dealer because his status.
---
100% Alt, just try and make it a different starting zone to remove the repetitiveness. Alts are useful in Classic even if they are just crafting alts or farmers
---
To play the game, really. For me at least it's not about strict power progression if I'm getting gear that let's me either take my spec into new stuff to clear, or play other specs with new itemization.

When chuck Norris gets diarrhea he doesn’t poop into the toilet, he collects that shit in a bucket and then swirls it around and takes a huge drink of it, chewing the solid chunks then he pukes that out into a blender and pours milk in and makes a smoothie and drinks his own crap and puke!

Wierd, they're still visible for me.

Nah you want slower weapons regardless. When you’re horde you want to use hamstring to fish out windfury and when alliance you use slam without delaying your swing timer.

stop fighting a battle which makes no sense.

I've tried it multiple times it doesn't work
---
It only takes about 25g and an hour of crafting crap to get engineering up to 230.  This lets you use gnomish battle chicken for a party-wide attack speed buff. You can also use goblin sappers at this level which is the only way a rogue can do aoe damage. On some fights, it's a significant amount of damage and some consider it mandatory.
---
*Battle chicken mechanics haven't been confirmed on classic yet, so the chicken might not be worthwhile if you can't swap back to a normal trinket.

But who knows he could also mean redoing story which I would not mind.

Blizzard has oceanic servers for all of their games. It would be bizzare for them to not add a few for classic.
---
I intend to waste many an hour helping others, of course I plan to level as holy so making friends is a priority
---
I see no reason we wouldn't get at least one, even if they assume the target market here is small. They've already negotiated the hosting for retail anyway.
---
Recently levelled a paladin on a pserver and had so much fun buffing everyone and their pets

I like your name u/CHAINSAW_VASECTOMY

Related: is there a distance to being placed in combat?

In classic MC raids we had a Paladin in the raid stand 60-80 yards away, out of combat, and res dead people.
---
Just because he didn't do it in the tiny clip you watched doesn't mean he didn't report it.
---
It doesn't matter how mad you get. You didn't get an invite to the beta, you're not getting one, stop being an 35 year old baby.

My Alliance Quest Completionist guide (https://shadowpanther.net/questing.htm) will take you on an epic journey through every single quest at the appropriate level all the way through level 40. I’m currently testing it on the Beta, and have updated it through level 20.
---
Oh yeah. He did kinda run away. Whoops
---
I thought that was thrall lol
---
Haven't seen any in classic but in WotLK a GM showed up, told a bunch of jokes and fixed a bugged professor putricide for us
---
Nope, they could just leave it up. That's also cheaper.
---
Agreed, watching venruki is great.
---
I think Alliance somehow had a stable world server (or shards/layers/whatever). On Horde side we had world server down pretty much every 5 minutes. Making it damn near impossible to organize anything. They also had rollbacks, my trip from Mulgore to Orgrimmar took 3x as long as it should have because of them.

It also looks like many shards (err layers....) were collapsed there. You had so many people in one place. Whereas we had much less people in each shard (errr layer), and many different patterns being made. We had a small circle on the bank roof in one shard/layer/whatever. A larger circle near the entrance in another, a pizza in another and as you might have seen the pentagram in another.. None had THAT many players as you'll see.
---
Also our "end of server event" was Highlord Hogger Fordragon (Basically Bolvar, but with a gnoll appearance) replacing Thrall. Meaning only Vol'jin (and a bunch of level 10s trying to heal him) plus guards were on him. It was a losing battle anyway, but we never got close because world server ALWAYS went down before he even got to 70%. Not to say it wasn't fun to try though.
---
All in all, my main hope is Blizz work out what was causing the world server (or layer server) to constantly crash. Because, on stress test it's fine and we expect it, but if it's happening (sometimes with a 5 minute or so rollback) on retail launch they'll have many unhappy Hordsters.
---
No offence to US streamer they are ok tbh but I rather prefer playing with Preach or Nixxion.
---
That’s different. You can always stealth or shadowmeld while eating or drinking provided you’re out of combat
---
Macsimum eentelijence is recuaierd to anderstand teh so hard taitel.
---
I don't really want a guide so much as as "go to this zone at this level" and "these quests are the most flavourful and good for lore fans"
---
Why yes, we did mention Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker.
---
Doesn’t vanilla do ten levels at a time? 10-19, not 14-19?
---
How does that relate to WoW?
---
She thicc though so it would be appreciated none the less
---
This is from a private server. Should’ve hidden your guild name.
---
When I'm sick of mainstream streamers I usually just check out random strangers who just started streaming. For me it's usually a pleasant experience to watch someone I've never seen before to be honest.
---
Because we know how well went TBC and some people are afraid, and they are right to be, that Blizzard could do some shitfrst with Classic New Content.
---
Considering there has been devilsaur hide mafias created by nonestreamers on private servers, if one streamer decides its something he/she wanna do on the server there will be a hard time shutting that down.
---
Esfand, definitely. The dude is so chill yet funny. I don’t think I’ve ever even heard the guy curse before which is weird since most streamers have Tourettes.
---
Technically, activision left bungee and bungee still remains no? Not sure but I was basing my opinion on that
---
When chuck norris goes swimming he doesn’t get wet, the water gets Norris’d.

Auctioning Stuff.
---
It's easy, the hard part is knowing what skills you're going to be casting and switching to the respective stance, if you mess up that's a missed GCD
---
&gt;they removed it because they were too lazy to design locations like they did in Icecrown/storm peaks
---
Plain wrong. You do realise they're designing the new zones with flight in mind? They don't magically patch in new zones which work with flying. We're talking locations that were designed 1.5+ years before flying gets enabled for them.
---
Achievements
---
Heh. My first main took **37 days /played** to get to 60 because I stopped at level 30 for like two months to PvP (this was back when the BG brackets were 21-30, 31-40, etc.)
---
^
---
Not a big fan of the streaming community but staysafe is pretty good. And the chat isn’t at that level where everyone is just spamming “POGGERS” or whatever the fuck. Plus he’ll show up to some of the world PvP events and just rinse kids

---
There's always the "Callsic WoW Guilds" Discord: [https://discordapp.com/invite/HNT7UPq](https://discordapp.com/invite/HNT7UPq)
---
Happening simultaneously is not a thing. It's a program going linearly through instructions/a list of events in a batch, there has to be an order, even if it's random.
---
The things that make warrior slow can be countered with good play and a full understanding of your limitations. 
---
There are plenty of nuances with warrior that make them tougher than people realize. They have no real reliable interrupt until the late 30’s due to shield bash requiring a shield (so you’d need a weapon swap macro just to interrupt something which can take time and can be annoying especially while leveling) 
---
They have no real reliable instant attacks to take advantage of that big heavy slow weapon you’ll want to be using until the late 30s which means you can either hamstring kite (gets tedious during those 12 hour leveling sessions) or you can just face tank a hefty amount of damage. 
---
Some people on this sub will say you can dual wield. Don’t. They are idiots.  The only time dual wielding becomes acceptable is on a fresh server in your 50’s when whirlwind axe falls off because it can be tough to get a good two hander and the thrashblade is pretty good when combined with venomhide poison. 
---
Warriors have trouble soloing a lot of quests.  You will find yourself grinding a bit here and there to stay ahead of the quest level curve. 
---
It’s not hard - but you do need to be more patient. 
---
Also on a PvP server you are a free kill always.
---
Grinding, professions, playing the AH.  Pick your poison.
---
It used to happen Horde side, during BC at least. Not much, but sometimes some spontaneous world RP would happen.
---
Also events happened a lot too all the way up to Mists when I pretty much stopped playing.
---
We didn't have Goldshire, but if you ever visited Argent Porn-EU's (sic) Goldshire, you'd agree that's a good thing :P

My boy Crendor.
---
As someone who played on Nostalrius at launch (no sharding or dynamic spawns) it's nowhere near unplayable. People are so upset over having to wait 1 minute for a mob to respawn they'd rather destroy the integrity of the game with sharding. And at the same time they have to over-exaggerate their experiences on private servers in an attempt to sell it. Unbelievable.
---
Org looks different?
---
I’m talking about WoD, Legion and BfA, flying is gated until the end as it kills organic player interaction.
---
If I remember right from doing tons of Warrior PvP in Vanilla, Protection can be surprisingly potent. Its weakness isn't damage output like the other comments say, but Rage starvation. If you can manage to use your abilities, they are pretty strong.
---
This is Jesus 2.0 :p
---
Lol another hipster.
---
Edgemaster gaunts bis rest of game.
---
Good grief, this lame response again...
---
Listen, just because players are happy to have a version of Warcraft they deem far better that the current Retail base or Developers think is best, then let them have it and stay out of the sub. It's obvious you really have no care for this period of the game. There are a lot that due.
---
The case of the PServer populations over that last 10+ years is enough of that.
---
The proof in the dwindling Retail population shows that the game isn't heading in the right direction as well. 
---
The HYPE of Classic is proof that players want something that gets them to log in and play with other players, even if gear isn't the reason.
---
So hate on Classic and the fans all you want, Wit the content plans for this version coming over the next 2 years we have more than enough to hype this game for that entire time while Retail sits back and hope the next expansion is better than BFA but not WOD...
---
/Done
---
Yessss
---
Not the same thing. Bungee had a contract with activision to make and maintain this game. Blizzard IS activision . The company is one and the same thing. They merely kept the name because “backtivision” isn’t catchy.
---
Think when a company buys another but keeps the name the same so as not to confuse consumers.
---
There is no separating the 2 because they simply are not the two they are the one.
---
Horses are usually everywhere in classic.
---
I'm sure Joana will take a look at this.  It's obvious you've put in a huge amount of work.  Don't feel to bad about burning out on the writing part.  In my experience, it takes ten times longer to "translate" my own stuff for others to use.  And WoW is, indeed, huge.
---
&gt; .. makes me realize that the most exciting part of Classic, for me, will be the small interactions with people you meet out in the wild.
---
I agree so much! I didn't think the social aspect would be a huge deal, but then I played the stress test yesterday, and in level 4 or 5 I ran into trouble dealing with the damn Yeti's in Dun Morogh. I asked for help in General chat and a Gnome Warlock came to my rescue. An hour later I needed help with the Frostmane Hold trolls, and look and behold, this nice Gnome was there again, brining along 2 other friends, and we ended up being partied for the remainder of the stress test having a lot of fun and chat. I can't wait for this game to release &lt;3
---
The power infusion build puts more talents into disc tree but that doesn't make you a disc priest to be precise ;) Druids have nice leveling, can tank stuff even in raids while their healing toolking is (much) smaller than a priest and the HoTS also have limitations. It's a good class to be active outside of raids (go farm this, bear-solo low level dungeon for something, carry flag in BG). Palas can be very efficient healers and they have the super-buff, can even farm undead as HPala. Tl&amp;dr pick Shaman.

I always thought the arms icon was just two hands. Boy was I wrong.
---
Without layers there’d just be lag, which I’m fine with. I want the authentic experience, I do not want to see things disappear in front of me when I join a party.
---
I thought I remember hearing him say he hates pvp before on a wow classic podcast. Here he has a pocket healer and thinks he's kicking ass. Please, amateur, stick to pve.
---
He hath risen anew to save wow from its sins and set us back on the true path!
---
It really is not there have always been gear in almost all games that say limits you damage taken from say different elements and/or different NPC classes let's say like beasts. It makes absolutely sense lore vise for adventurers to have different specialised gear sets for different occasions.
---
They are actually not sharding, they are doing layering only for launch, which theoretically will be much better.
---
lol ty, now gimme 55 more levels
---
Main issue regarding new content is that if people already playing to Naxx meta
---
You will literally see a huge jump in powercreep, even somebody with r14 weapon will be a demigod, and the problems is that you have to maintain the " vanilla itemization " and adding new gear without ruining the feeling of classic.
---
It isn't impossible but it requires a well done job.
---
Okay, I was unsure. Thanks!
---
AQ40 &amp; Naxx guilds already sell MC boosts so your point is mute lol
---
Druids are OP
---
30s cd on shock kind of makes it pointless.
---
TBC had leg enchants and helm enchants. [Here's one of my Twinks from TBC. A Paladin flag runner.](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/character/us/durotan/believe) The enchants have now changed. At some point Blizz changed what the enchants did and retroactively changed them for everyone.
---
Trust me , I know it feels better to think blizzard are the good guys and activision is forcing them to do horrible things.
---
But really no, Activision-Blizzard just suck. Just like most modern day companies.
---
I'll bite: 
---
I've never understood the argument disparaging humans and those who play them in a fantasy game. Sure, I might be a human in real life but I'm not also capable of wielding a gigantic sword twice my size and weight or riding a dragon in battle. I don't have huge muscles, and I'm not capable of shooting fire from my fingertips. That said, playing a human in a fantasy game helps anchor the player into a world so unlike their own. It provides a connection to an avatar in that world that looks and feels like them, and in doing so makes the experience feel more "immersive" for many.
---
Humans in fantasy are as interesting as you make them. Now as far as WoW is concerned, Human females look great, and while I have problems with the Human male skeleton plate gear looks great on them (probably because they were modeled for humans first) and their animations are fantastic. Some of the most iconic figures in the lore and games have been Human Warriors: Varian Wrynn, Anduin Lothar, the Arathi dynasty, Trollbanes, and Herod the Scarlet Champion. 
---
Not to mention warriors from other fictional works as well like Achilles and Odysseus, Boromir and Aragorn, the many fighters of differing dispositions in A Song of Ice and Fire, and the plethora of real world examples of fighters we can draw from. 
---
Now none of this will matter for most, but it might be an explanation as to why some people are inspired to play a Human Warrior beyond the bonuses to weapon skill (which are irrelevant at best, Escape Artist and Stoneform are far, far, far superior reasons to choose a race strictly on the basis of racials). For my part, I'll be rolling their slightly more flavorful cousins - the Paladin. Human, of course.
---
Tauren can only ride Kodos, yeah. I don't think there are any other restrictions.
---
Wow that is an awesome shot. Thank you!
---
Okay thanks.
---
What kind of stuff?
---
That is the part of the joke. Look at the character name, too. It's hilarious and I love it.
---
The other thing to think of is how transmog would affect the low level boe market.  IMO there's no place for it in vanilla.
---
The only bad thing I can see in Wrath was LFG. That's it. Also, another comment without mentioning anything about PvP.
---
Another option is to have realms with periodic (1-2 years) resets. And there's no reason, other than support costs, that all Classic realms have to follow the same path.
---
I can't really think of anything other than he's popular .
---
Exactly! Enjoy the leveling e xperience :D
---
Alchemy makes the best Bear Druid trinket for the entire game.
---
Leatherworking makes the best Cat Druid legs for half the game.
---
Leatherworking makes the best belt for Resto Druids and Holy Paladins for ~70% of the game.
---
Tailoring makes the best robes for Mage and Priests for half the game.
---
Tailoring makes the best robes, legs, and feet for Warlocks for 80% of the game.
---
Blacksmithing makes the best helmet for Fury warriors for the entire game.
---
There's also tons of useful resist gear.
---
So no, do not buff crafting.
---
Chuck Norris arm so big, they had to make seven expansions to make space after he entered the barrens in 2004.
---
Getting it was pretty rare before everyone knew, or maybe wow had the functionality, to link with the item code. I always thought it was about a bit of showing off at first and always devolved into stupid shenanigans. Then quickly became a thing.
---
The old Neighteleven.
---
If the raids are hard enough, competitive players will do them. Loot is just a bonus. Guilds don't continue to speedrun MC &amp; BWL for loot when they've already had Naxx on farm for months, they're speedrunning them as a form of competition.
---
I've definitely noticed this too - but as you say the aggro grace period seems to be functioning fine.
---
Haha ok Dwight
---
Noooooo the 40 man design allows for more people and specs to get into raids

FWIW I don’t think J. Allen Brack deserves to be crucified the way he is in this thread. Dude has dedicated a big chunk of his life to WoW, and it seems like he’s changed his mind about Classic anyway.
---
But watching this video still grinds my gears just a tad.
---
Implying I don't talk with people directly. Other than completely misinterpreting what I wrote you're doing a terrible job at making up stories to try and dismantle my argument.
---
Happy Cake day !
---
Thing is, you're always going to have two groups of people: those that want BiS, and those that don't care enough about it. You can never truly have two equal items in the same slot in WoW, so the BiS crowd will always go for the one that ends up being 0.05% better. For everyone else, there's already *plenty* of "almost as good" gear that doesn't require a bunch of material farming. Hell, warlocks use Felcloth shoulders and gloves until T2.
---
Also the "running an instance 2-3 times" is bunk, it's luck-based and could take way longer, and you need 5 people to do it. Of course it's going to yield better rewards overall. Farming/crafting isn't that, it's "you're guaranteed to get this item with these materials". The only luck involved is some material drop rates if you choose to farm (which you can usually do on your own whenever you like) rather than buy, and for a lot of classes it's going to be more beneficial to just use the normal moneymaking methods and then buy the stuff.
---
After reading this, its actually a nice thing with layering, im all in on the nochanges, but this one is okay
---
i know what moving goal posts is. and i edited out my edit because i think it's rude and non constructive to change a post when someone is likely mid-reply. i was just going to put it in this post instead, i'm not that worried about your feelings don't worry.
---
while you think he's moving goal posts i think you're strawmanning, but i can't be assed to elaborate on mobile. op obviously never meant exactly perfectly equal in the first place because that's impossible. you aren't being constructive to the spirit of his actual question.
---
Horde, Alliance are overrated.
---
Equivalent gear can also mean different itemization but no more stat budget. That could potentially open up the door to more specs being viable. Also different tier bonuses can easily beat out more stats. There are dozens of ways to easily make lower ilvl gear worth getting.
---
I once soulstoned my VW by accident...
---
That's a really bad reason to find someone insufferable lol. Seems like you're just looking for a small streamer.
---
Wow, awesome!
---
I want to play the game. Looks like we are at odds.
---
Definitely not a waste of time since there are good quests there.
---
No, you're wrong, based on math. Same in any business, social media platform, etc.. the question is how well do impressions translate into action (clicks, purchases, etc), in the case of WoW classic, it's a very high %. And then, how many of those actions stick around? That part is unknown, but it sure as hell will be higher than retail wow, which has reasonable-ish retention. 
---
So no. Given the HUGE impressions, HUGE action, and logically inferred HUGE retention, Classic will, logically, guaranteed, be HUGE.
---
Omg I should make some content for karma!
---
gotta love the Twitch speak going on...
---
Chuck Norris has sex with every female once a month
---
I didn’t enjoy TBC as much as I enjoyed vanilla, I disliked flying and the reduction in PvE raid sizes. It sucked for me losing 15-20 friends as the raid size was cut. It also felt empty, so much open empty zones.
---
To me it is the being of the of end of what WoW was. I worry if classic goes to TBC then WoD eventually we’ll get to Cata.. and that’s when the game lost all its soul.
---
Great meme, bad font colour!
---
99% of quest rewards are not able to be traded to another player.

Thank you for comment. I wonder why people download absolute facts? Like you literally haven't said a single bad word, no judgement at all. You just stated facts. :(
---
Thanks for this dude. Just joined and made a noob post!
---
Take a look at the system requirements. 🤦‍♂️
---
Chuck Norris has already stress tested AQ40.
---
So far on the stress tests it's been nothing but love. Tons of people asking mundane questions and learning stuff through chat!
---
There is plenty of lore in every path. As you level much more slowly, you can experience quit a bit of it really by just playing. I'd say pick the zone/race you are most drawn to, as then you will be focusing on lore related to them (at least in the beginning).
---
You're assuming I want in. 
---
I've been waiting for long enough, 3 more months won't kill me.
---
He's not originally but he's moving (or already has moved) to the UK and mentioned that he intends to play on EU servers.
---
 Don’t want to insult anybody. But you’re an idiot, math isn’t wrong...
---
I’m talking in a few year time, vanilla can’t last forever, it will need something fresh or TBC. I’d take fresh over TBC.
---
Misanthrope or sociopath?  How do you identify.
---
I like watching Joana do his "test" leveling routes, no obnoxious music or yelling etc, just calmly chilling and doing his thing. Its the guy who did one of the first 1-60 Hunter world records in vanilla.
---
Can someone explain this screenshot?
---
And because flying is the fastest way to remove player interaction. Ever since flying was Introduced in tbc, player interaction fell and you cannot design your way out of people flying over stuff.
---
Not to mention, it turned the world from a massive planet like thing, into a minor place you can effectively traverse in half an hour. Scaling goes out the window with flying mounts and free roaming.
---
..nothing worse than discovering a new MOTW or PwF with about 50 mins left on it , where you got buffed but didn't get a chance to thank them.
---
(was going to post that  [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bv5ams/me_when_people_in_the_world_give_me_buffs_but_i/)  btw , but a mod closed it in the  old Blizzard style  tradition of 'Fun detected, must eliminate' ...seriously the guys here need to relax a bit)
---
And on the 15th day, he rested (due to California Labor Laws).
---
Heh, yeah Asmongold can be annoying to watch. I do appreciate how he is himself, even if he is whiny. I watch stream clips but, I don't think I could be a part of his community.
---
Lots of respect for Asmon, would never watch his stream.
---
Jello water?
---
What if fresh turns out to be worse than TBC?
---
Storm Peaks was alright. That zone was completely designed around flying. But they just as well could have added a different transport mechanism between elevation like more flight paths or flight path-like transport.
---
Knowing your group.  Knowing the encounters.  So that you know when to swap mitigation gear for threat/dps gear.  Eventually, you even tank as fury... but probably not in Phase 1.
---
I’ve said something for many an MMO and I hope I don’t say it for Classic. 
---
This would be a great game if it wasn’t for all the people playing it.
---
Right. It’s just gotten frustrating. It’s like watching people go backwards.
---
Just yesterday some dude gave him a 50g value necklace for free. Then another dude came by and gave him 10g for free. Then ANOTHER dude came by and gave him pots for free. Then ANOTHER dude gave him his BIS int/stam chest. 
---
Why are you lying? It’s in the vods. Maybe YOU should watch them.
---
Veteran here - I'm going to be the same person now as I was then. I'm here to shit on alliance, sometimes having a dance party beforehand, and otherwise give a lot of love to Horde and just be a good dude and perform my dudities to the community. I'm always happy seeing players arrive, but I'm here to relive the nostalgia and otherwise finally enjoy an mmorpg again(I haven't since 2004-2007) and this time with IRL friends that are equally as stoked. A couple of them are Retail too, and they absolutely LOVE how different and more meaningful the journey and end is in Classic. I cannot wait to Raid with them and many others, and I am super stoked to enjoy the many social interactions required in Classic/Vanilla. Despite it's flaws; Vanilla simply had a great formula. 
---
Classic will be successful regardless. If anything can destroy it's success, it'd sooner be Bots and Cheaters that go unattended/ignored by Blizzard. My concern is that it's super old, but the rest of the world(bots and cheaters) grew more advanced without it... making it easier to loop around to an older game and screw it up.
---
Then that’s at least a new adventure.
---
I've been saying this for years at this point man, this is so high on my list of places I need to visit in classic.
---
It did fix Feral Druid itemization a bit, so that was nice for me.
---
BfA is a new adventure
---
Companies have spun out of other companies after a merger before. It can happen.
---
Chrysler did this with Daimler-Benz. Became DaimlerChrysler. It was the. Spun off and became Chrysler LLC. Then it was acquired merged with Fiat. It is now Fiat Chrysler.
---
Behave yourself. While the game is going back 14-15 years social norms are not. You are not going to have deep conversations just to join a group. You are not going to be asking about quest item locations. You are not going to be immersed in a community.
---
The reality is hard hitting, when entering a pug (if you ever abandon your retail clique) you will simply whisper the leader (or queue via the add on which will ultimately be designed) "&lt;spec&gt;, &lt;ilvl&gt; inv pls". You are not going to see people asking questions about quest item locations, and you are not going to get answered even if you do ask. You will be using an add on to find the quest items for you. You are not going to find yourself in a community that resembles a decade ago, quite the opposite. Everyone will be forming clique's rapidly, everyone will be using the least amount of communication possible because that is the world as we know it today.
---
Boomers may wish for a return to the past, but it's lost. Classic wow may come back in it's old form but social norms have moved on. You're going to have to live with that. If social norms not returning to what they were 13-15 years ago stops classic being successful, then I am sorry for your inevitable disappointment.
---
Downvoted because you are speaking the thruth sigh reddit.

Gotta try to summon metzen in org !
---
Agreed man, real fan of classic but finding some chill content is near impossible. Will just have to make it myself come release I guess!
---
Get skinning, kill every mob you see and vendor the leather except up until thick and rugged (maybe even heavy)
---
Vendor gray items and white armor and weapons
---
Try AH for any green/blue items or white reagents
---
Be frugal and only spend money on spells you actually use in your rotation. Do not buy gear on the AH or vendor until you're 60 and it's your BiS (devilsaur, etc.)
---
I’m glad you informed us that you’re old though so we can just get that part out of the way.
---
Madseasonshow is hands down my favourite. So chill and knowledgable.
---
If they do continue original developments for Classic WoW, akin to how OSRS has progressed, I'd hope they do horizontal progress instead of Vertical. Which means, no level cap increase, and while new dungeons / areas could offer improved gear / crafting mats / potions, it can't be a huge difference. But in this approach, all the old content? It's still relevant. Group of new 60s come into the fray? New guild? Start at Onyxia, MC, work your way through all the content! Nothing skipped, nothing discarded to the bins of oblivion. 
---
Vertical progression was the true death knell of retail.
---
I'm the OP, someone else responded to you first. Every time I've turned on soda he's been loud and obnoxious, just very annoying to listen to.
---
That's crazy! I wonder if that guy is gonna play Classic WoW...
---
While leveling at launch, vendor everything you find unless it's something rare that can sell later on. Take skinning and vendor all the skins. Grind skinnable mobs for a few levels in the late 30s. Don't buy anything you don't need including unneeded spells. If you do this, you'll have enough for a mount when you hit 40 (or very close).
---
Unless you really know what you're doing, you'll be 60 for a while before getting your epic mount. Money making at 60 is a huge topic. There's tons of ways to do it.
---
Everything has a place there. You'll have to peruse the AH and find out. Prices and Items vary quite a bit and it's your job to keep track of it. Free Market is willy nilly sometimes. It'll take a month or two after release for it to mostly stabilize too.
---
Yes there is the most immersive way. And thats the guide without following any guide.
---
Right , even if this happened it wouldn’t be blizzard. You are missing the point. Sure they can somehow detach but the people are gone. It’s been too long.

It's mad triggering when just a week ago, just suggesting 1.13 would get you downvoted to hell. We just want to see the complete vanilla that blizzard envisioned. This sub has a strong toxic mentality that blizzard will fuck it up somehow or they don't know what classic is. As if the people who made your favorite game have no idea what they're doing lmao. 
---
We got retail now because nobody expected WoW to be the MMO that lasts 15 years, of course the problems with modern wow was going to happen eventually. It's the first and only mmo in the world that deals with these exact problems and the sub is filled with frothy troglodytes that expect perfect game development a decade past it's expected lifetime.

&gt; **explain like I'm five** 
---
Some magic will happen that the servers will not crash on release and you can play with your friends on the server if you invite them :)
---
Kael and Vashj were good fights, though, so there's at least that to redeem it. Hyjal was a joke and so was most of BT. BT fights were really gimmicky and the smaller raid size meant less room for error. I'd bet if BT was a 40 man it would have been steamrolled.
---
Early on I think the AH will be very touch and go - the economy is going to fluctuate a lot until everything gets settled and a decent amount of gold is in circulation. Epic mounts and grinding for them are going to screw a lot of stuff up.
---
Use this to your advantage - if you see BoE epics for sale on the AH early, chances are they'll be cheap by comparison early on - Staff of Jordan, which probably sells for 1500g later on in vanilla (for twinking) might cost 10% of that during the first month or two. If you're willing to invest early, you can make a big profit by holding these items and waiting.
---
Look at BiS lists, and see what items you can craft, and sell them. Crafting is a gold-sink initially but if you're diligent about spamming trade with what you can make, you can easily recoup your investment. Don't forget to farm rep to make resist gear (Thorium Brotherhood, Cenarion Circle, Argent Dawn). 
---
Finally don't be afraid to grind - I grinded SM Cath for my first epic mount, literally just running the instance at 60, solo, looting everything and selling it. Get some decent BoE's and sell them, otherwise send them all to a bank alt, disenchant them and sell the mats. It's a literal grind, but I think it took about 2 weeks of ~2 hours/day to get enough for that epic mount.
---
Make friends with a guild. I partnered up with a top end guild once I had my economy rolling. I told them for every BoE set piece out of MC they didn't need, they could C.O.D. it to me for 400g. This gave the guild a quick way to put gold in the bank, without hassling on the AH, and they could use the income to buy materials/consumables for their next AQ/BWL/Naxx raid. Seems silly, but every week, I'd have 4-5 C.O.D.'s of BOE gear in my mailbox. I turned these around for a 12-15% profit on average (I have a spreadsheet somewhere that saved all the buy/sell prices) because I was one of the only ones selling these on the AH, and I eventually even had people sending me tells, asking to bypass the AH, guaranteed money if the item they wanted dropped. By the time Naxx dropped I had over 25,000 gold to my name, and was able to drastically influence the economy all on my own. If you ever wanted to be a kingpin/monopolist, classic wow is your best bet.

He played on EU servers before he moved anyway.
---
&gt;At the point where I really started liking dungeons, I kept running Maraudon and Uldaman - but Desolace and the Badlands were, arguably, two of the "worst" zones in the classic game (although the centaur quests in Desolace were a first taste of reputation grinding, so that's interesting). Likewise, the Swamp of Sorrows kind of feels like a big zone built around the Sunken Temple with not a lot of questing. The same goes for Feralas and Dire Maul.
---
I personally hated Uldaman and didn't much like Mara. But that's the magic of WoW - there's something for everyone. Plenty of zones/dungeons to pick from.
---
Tauren can ride wolves as well after patch 1.7 iirc.
---
Obviously you would have higher ping, it’s across the fucking ocean.
---
Abusing LoS with a hunter in DM.
---
The only way for you two to settle this is an old fashion duel
---
&gt; having to wait 1 minute for a mob to respawn
---
Mob respawns are usually 5 minutes without dynamic respawns. Also waiting that time for the mob to respawn is fine, until you have to do it another 9 times to complete the quest. Then move onto the next one. [Here's a queue for a starting zone mob](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcjoqRVOF20), looks fun right?
---
So no it's not an exaggeration. 
---
&gt; they'd rather destroy the integrity of the game with sharding.
---
They aren't sharding anything, layering is very different, unnoticable, and only for a few weeks. People are so upset at the thought of any sort of compromise that they would rather see the game launch a total shitshow at launch. Unbelievable.
---
We thought you don't,
---
but you do
---
Better yet, no vertical progression. No level cap increase. New dungeons, new raids, yes, improved gear, yes. But all within reason. Small-ish jumps in power, and level 60 MC gear even after 3-4 expansions will still be relevant to new guilds.
---
This was mostly a TBC thing wasn't it?
---
Kinda weird to not doing something because it's rude and then call someone a dick anyway, but okay. The thread's still going properly, this is gibberish.
---
He's a nerd who speaks with pretentious authority, as if he's commanding an army in a generic action movie. It's obvious from how he talks that he thinks highly of himself and little of others and that he believes himself to be the smartest in the room. Like a chud.
---
Threw a big tantrum just this morning after losing a duel to a hunter. Didn't sac void or LOS, made salty excuses for 10 minutes after while chat grilled him.       I dunno
---
You’re joking right? Just yesterday within an hour I saw soda receive the following for free: 
---
BIS int/stam chest for free
---
50g value necklace for free
---
Some dude came by and just traded him 10g
---
Another dude came by and traded him like 10 potions
---
I play horde on the beta. I don’t blame the alliance at all for not wanting to queue into this type of bullshit. It’s not fun and the fact that soda throws a hissy fit about it is hilarious. If he was on the receiving end he would be so mad and rage in his stream.
---
Did you completely miss that I was talking about 1-299, and not just level 300?
---
God said "Let there be light."
---
Chuck Norris said "OK".
---
Sorry, you’re just wrong.
---
I’m sure you have played plenty, just not vanilla.
---
“WORSE”...You’re being vague again. That’s because you don’t rly know wtf you’re talking about. You’ve read forums and now consider yourself knowledgeable enough to advise new players. You’re not, but keep churning out the same sentences we’ve all read a billion times. That’s just what OP is looking for, I’m sure.
---
You’re saying that because hunters can’t top the meters in the second half of endgame PvE there is no point playing one. Please.
---
Soup
---
Assuming you are right and it was only briefly, then that patch must have been during Wrath, because I 100% hopped over the gate in AB during Wrath.
---
I wouldn’t recommend hanging out there, with it being destroyed and fill with green shit and all
---
I plan on playing a rogue, so I'll just feel bad if a priest or a druid gives me a buff out on the road. We're a selfish class.
---
Man your sarcasm is embarrassing....
---
Did classic release in 2019 with this amount of hype?
---
Also how many servers did they have at launch again?
---
You played yourself. Google the definition of nuance.
---
Look up making gold in vanilla wow on Youtube. There are many videos outlining how to do it. I recommend Frostadamus channel for some good ideas. The series is called "Rags to Riches."
---
If people want to jump down a bridge, should we let them ?Blizzard need to follow its vision. The community's point of view can be taken in consideration but in moderation and not 100%. Because when you try to please everyone, you please no one.
---
I would never skip it in PvE, but I don't think I would take it in PvP. 10 extra rage every 30 seconds isn't useless, that's one free Hamstring or Pummel, but I'm just not sure where you would get the talent point from.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/BSMzPxMhA_AdDAA
---
This is the spec I plan to use. I'm not sure any of these talent points are worth losing for 1 rage every 3 seconds in PvP.
---
1. Killing monsters that drop valuable items or larger percentages of money, over and over and over.
---
2. Using gathering professions (Mining, Skinning, and Herbalism) to gather in-demand materials, over and over and over.
---
3. Selling Alchemy cooldowns (Tailoring has one also).
---
4. Selling any profession item where the materials are cheaper than the finished product (there aren't many).
---
5. Selling the ability to make rare crafting items that many others don't have the recipe for (again, not great).
---
But most importantly, becoming intimately familiar with the auction house. When are prices low? When are prices high? What are the answers to that for EVERY type of item? What will be more valuable later as more content releases? What will be less valuable? What can you buy on the AH and turn a profit on? What price should you set? All of this is the most rewarding skill obtained in the game and very few do it well and you can't do 1-5 very well without at least some knowledge.
---
You attempted to compare them, but you don't seem to know what the definition of a comparison is. 
---
comparison noun
---
com·​par·​i·​son | \ kəm-ˈper-ə-sən  , -ˈpa-rə-\
---
Definition of comparison
---
1 : the act or process of comparing: such as
---
a : the representing of one thing or person as **similar to or like another**
---
If Fortnite and World of Warcraft's releases are different and not similar, then using Fortnite as a comparison is a major fail on your part. 
---
I really don't think there's an argument to be made that the resilience stat fragments the PVP and PVE groups and you can go ahead and love that it's fragmented but I won't, deal with it.
---
You can get progression by adding more tiers of gear on the exponential power creep curve. Which in many ways has the same effect as increasing the level cap.
---
The difference between the two approaches is that increasing the level cap (from e.g. 60 to 70) inherently means that players can make some lvl 60 content irrelevant, since their power at lvl 70 with non-raid gear will be higher than a lvl 60 with good raid gear, which makes at least some of the raids obsolete.
---
This has pros and cons: making old raids obsolete is obviously undesirable, which is a strike against increasing the level cap. But just adding more tiers of  gear means that anyone who is behind is always going to be behind with no catch-up mechanisms like you'd get from increasing the level cap.
---
Naturally some people think that not having any catch-up mechanisms is a good thing, but from a business standpoint, it really hurts your ability to keep a game going if new players are always faced with "you are 2 years behind, and will always be 2 years behind" with no way of catching up to play alongside their friends who started earlier.
---
So just never raid or dungeon ??
---
Stay away from my yeties.
---
Then let the tryhards have their tryharding, while the rest of us can get more enjoyment out of creating our own stuff that is actually worth using.
---
Priests have good leveling by focusing on spirit tap and wand specialisation talents to start. Hitting 40 you should respec to shadow on full. Then once you hit 60 you can choose to respec again.
---
Healing on priest is pretty versatile. Single target, hots and shields.
---
Druids generally are good to level. But like priests will need a respec. Druids are all about Heal over time.
---
Holy Palas have the best mana to heal efficiency. But can only do single target healing. They are also super easy to level as you basically auto attack your way to success.
---
Dwarves on Alliance are the best for priests because of their racial actives.
---
Paladins should lean towards dwarves. But really any race will do. Druids, just whatever race allows them.
---
The point wasn’t necessarily I want to play paladin but rather with certain classes do I need to be a certain race
---
And wasn’t just one server. Only someone who cannot understand perspective and nuance would argue against sharding. Ignorant people or trolls
---
until you run out of mana
---
+1 for Madseason and Kevin Jordan
---
The top 0.01% will do them for the prestige, the rest won't give a shit. Rewards are necessarily, it's how these games work. If they weren't do you not think they would have just done with gear inflation by now? Or do you think /u/Rykestone is somehow a better game developer than anyone at Blizzard for the last 20 years?
---
They can add gear that are as strong as T1/2/3 but that favor different gameplay. Increasing the diversity of playable spec at Max level.
---
Started launch day EU (Feb 11, 05). Here are the recorded datapoints at warcraftrealms:
---
Lvl Date
---
60 Mar 16
---
55 Mar 09
---
50 Mar 03
---
45 Feb 25
---
40 Feb 20
---
35 Feb 18
---
So 30-35 days realtime to hit 60. I've lost most of my old screenshots but vaguely remember hitting 60 with approx. 17d /played. That averages to about 12h ingame every day.
---
Look for someone who wears red with white stripes.
---
Yea lmao, but retards won't admit anything is conservative because in their world they are constantly the victim and all news outlets are the enemy that are out to get them
---
Hopefully the 1 year break is enough to give it another shot, would be awesome if the guide is done at least up to level 50. Before launch, the last 10 levels are always more grindy. The current guide if I remember right has almost no grinding up to level 50.
---
Its simple.  Everything but ubrs is intended to be 5man in classic
---
Not hard to wrap your brain around
---
Druid traditionally has the lowest pop
---
And it is similar, you just don't like that so you try to dismiss it.
---
Both games remain **as an objective fact** to have not been designed with X in mind. Which was your claim for neglecting Y.
---
Bless their hearts
---
I played one of those 10 day free trial disks back in like '05 and I wanted to try and hit level 10 (the trial cap) in a week, it seemed like a monumental task. I didn't even know what max level was. Good (terrible) times.
---
Tell that to Guild wars 1 players and its 1000's hours played.
---
I haven't played in 6 years and never play video games. Tempted to come back with this
---
Same here, can‘t be more happy. The „INVITE TO ASMON LAYER FFS“ spamming showed me, that it will be absolutely horrible on a streamer server. I knew it will be bad, but this was some new level shit
---
Absolutely grab the WW axe early.  Warriors are a completely weapon reliant class and you will never experience another power spike like getting a level 40 rare equivalent weapon in your early 30s.
---
GGX bois /s
---
Not really. All he's suggesting can fit different level and isn't in contradiction with seasonal reboot.
---
Considering we are getting the legion client this time - I doubt you’ll have any issues regarding terrain. The game feels pretty damn smooth
---
Isn’t warrior the only class with all 3 specs being top tier for something? Arms pvp fury pve dps And prot pve tank.
---
I remember back in vanilla my main source of income was my mooncloth cooldown.
---
Which was significantly easier to craft on alliance than on horde.  Horde had to travel out of the way for a moonwell.  Alliance could use the Temple of the Moon in Teldrassil.
---
An objective fact is that this change in Fortnite's design happened before the game was released, which is where your comparison breaks down and fails in a major way.
---
Dirge isn't even a good one. You have so many greats like [Rupture][Garrote][Evicerate][Ambush][Slam][Judgement] to name a few. Dirge is like the lamest one
---
You think you saw a video of an online dealer cheating their employer out of money to help Soda because of how popular he is on Twitch?
---
Are you being serious?
---
Adding a Naxx-level (or near-Naxx) 20 man would be cool, particularly if it added some type of gimmick like limited attempts or short timer (e.g. Algalon, Zul'Aman Bear run). Could even add Relics/Idols to shore up some weaknesses in the Paladin/Druid toolkits (taunt relic, tank CD idol).
---
Looks retarded tbh
---
Would rather just play AB if that's what modern WSG becomes
---
https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2017/03/07/how-left-or-right-wing-are-uks-newspapers
---
You are joking right?
---
Try to save a few area's for max level question. You get gold instead of XP when questing at 60. Save WPL/EPL or Silithus for questing when 60 and you'll make a tonne of money. 
---
Take skinning and a gathering profession, till you are 60, and vendor all the trash. DOnt buy things from the AH, you dont need much on the way to 60.
---
For the love of whats holy, CENTER your main monitor....
---
2.1 worst patch ever to happen. Pre 2.1 was almost a continuation of raid difficulty from Vanilla.
---
Luckily it appears there's no same-faction mob griefing, so maybe their Devilsaur Mafia days are over.
---
The story is that he locked himself in his office for 2 weeks and when he came out he had the method to streamline the port of the game to the modern client.  They already had an idea how to do it but it would have been tedious and not be as authentic.  So it could have happened without his efforts, yes, but it sounds very much so like he was solely responsible for the method they ended up using.
---
Didnt even remember that. I only remember the libram head enchants from vanilla. Heres mine: https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/character/eu/grim-batol/glowing
---
Never got the boots from fishing event in stv... 3x the fucking head.
---
Yesterday I had a good example. 1-6 leveling was easy in the NE territory, then I wend to the next city and doing the first quest the furbolgs raped me instantly. 
---
Couldn‘t be more happy
---
How long can you keep adding more powerful raids though? Even if the new gear is only 2% stronger, 3 or 4 raids in, the power creep would be immense. Also I’d worry that newer raids made by newer developers would make the actual Vanilla raids less relevant.
---
Anal[Hemorrage]
---
Is sword spec actually any good? I've been testing on some pservers and I have to say that axe spec seems to be infinitely more viable. With decentish gear and with nothing past BWL warriors can sit at nearly 30% crit chance. From what I've been reading too stats in general don't really affect your dmg as much as just having a slow weapon with high dmg, and that the only stat that can boost dmg in pvp is Crit. Ultimately it seems that you should spec into what ever your best weapon is but for theory sake, I would take a rank 14 2h axe over a rank 14 2h sword. Am I wrong? Can anyone prove it?
---
One problem is having a lot of people joining the server to play with a certain streamer, and if that streamer stops playing or changes server than your server becomes a ghost town very rapidly.
---
I don't know how's he now but I stopped watching him because he was mean to people and tried to mask it as "trolling". Also his viewers were THE worst I've seen at that time (admittedly not his fault but it still made his streams really bad). And he was a bit too much arrogant for my taste.
---
You can't link spells in classic you wrath baby
---
I hated Gnome and Temple with a passion usually reserved for the Alliance. The only reason I ever walked into Gnomer was for the clutch water breathing staff. Although both instances were tolerable when the group was good but ffs someone ALWAYS jumped off and let their pet/summon aggro the entire instance.
---
This question has been answered 4x in my reading to reach this comment. Learn to read fanboy
---
When the change in design happened doesn't magically change the similarity. The fact remains, a change happened that it was not designed in mind of.
---
I think I had the Horde's Ghost Mushroom market cornered pretty hard. I can't quite remember what else I sold though.
---
There are certain things that would drastically
---
change the game though too, like thunder clap in defensive stance
---
The issue you have has that  “Jack-of-All-Trades” role, dont tend to cut it in raids. They will for maybe MC, but into BWL, you'll be asked to go full healer.
---
Welcome home :‘)
---
They don't just "not top meters", they're at the bottom of the meter. And as we get into ZG, AQ, and Naxx, Tranq Shot becomes a less used mechanic.
---
I played a lot of vanilla. I won't claim to have raided but a few bosses in Naxx, but you don't have to to know that hunters are one of the least valuable classes in end-game PVE, if not the least.
---
Came to the comments to see if anyone else noticed, not disappointed.
---
Higher int increases the chance to gain weapon skills points when using them.
---
Found the cataclysm kid
---
I keep seeing people thinking that BC would overwrite peoples work put into Classic. There’s absolutely *no* way they would force people into BC though, they’ve made that clear with how Classic is a long-term project that they will keep up no matter how many play.
---
tbh you can always play female
---
Power creep is inevitable. Thats the whole point of progression! To make your character more powerful. They can minimize it by making new raids only a few ilvls above the current one, or by making them "alternate" raids that are equal..theres lots of ways to approach it that doesnt invalidate al previous raids
---
I can probably recommend Frost and Preach's YT videos. I don't watch them, or anyone really, stream so I don't know how they are during live broadcasts.
---
Except Fiat Chrysler still makes Jeep Wranglers even though none of the designers from before the Daimler merger work there any more. My dad bought one. They are still pretty good. It's possible to reclaim past design philosophies even if past designers aren't present.
---
They should have had a naked shaman or warrior using nightfall for extra spell damage.
---
No darkmoon fair buff no sand buff. Pleb.
---
\+10 int is better than +0 int. It's only a positive effect and it's not like they can give you strength.
---
Warlock has 2 good raiding specs and from what I can tell 3 good pvp specs. 2 or 3 other pvp specs that are also fun and can be good.
---
What do you think are the major problems in TBC that need to be vanillafied?
---
Personally for me its:
---
No flying
---
No level 70.
---
Probably keep Paladin and Shaman faction exclusive.  (Give belfs warriors or something to make up for it)
---
Tune down the green quest rewards.  Less rewards and way less stats.
---
This guy triggering my ptsd
---
Yeah Preach's streams are enjoyable and entertaining
---
I understand he has fans that gift him free shit but i also understand that for the MOST part he farmed MOST of it himself. Yes of course he gets gifted and mailed stuff but he was ahead of most players already just by the amount of time he has spent playing. How is that cheating?
---
Additional points of weapon skill are less useful as previous ones. In other words, going from 300 to 305 is a bigger boost than going from 305 to 310. At least on private servers. I'll be very interested to see how it works in classic.
---
Except if there wasn’t layering, you wouldn’t be able to log-on because of, for example, 9000 people  split into 3 separate layers of 3000 players each (roughly), you’d be in a queue of 6000 people trying to log in behind the other 3K that has already entered the server
---
He don't cater to the same type of viewers are Asmongold or Soda though. Sure there will be people joining his server but not to the same extent as the Muricans. 
---
Hopefully we are fine.
---
Guild name «Grand Teft Kodo» mase my day
---
NO 25 MAN RAIDS NO NO NO NO NO NO NO
---
Again let’s look at what is possible and what is likely? How’s that sound ?
---
Depends on how tryhard you and your guild are. In the current top tier tanking meta troll fury warriors are the best but that requires serious coordination between you and the healers as you don’t mitigate much damage. On the other end the least tryhard would be Tauren as the extra hp helps healers a little. Middle of the road is orcs with axe spec.
---
It's soo weird visiting videos and memes of WoW from that era.
---
I never said it should equal raiding gear. If you actually read my post you'll see that I focused on the leveling stuff.
---
Most of the similar PvP builds I see don't max out Two Handed Spec. It's only 1% damage per point which really isnt that much. You also havent maxed imp Hamstring.
---
Drop down to 3/5 2h Spec and grab Anger Management and 3/3 Imp Hamstring. You really wont notice a meagre 2% damage less but you'll definitely notice 1 rage per 3 seconds and 50% more bind procs.
---
And pickpocket for some extra cash.
---
Wasn't there one in Silithus, in the Cenarion Circle town? If you didn't have a mage to make you a portal what's the difference what faction were you? You either way have had to flypath half the continent (Theramore to Darnassus for Alliance and Orgirmmar to Cenarion Hold for Horde).
---
I will chase you to the ends of Azeroth, mage. Take my MotW!
---
dude, this is borderline religious.  An actual creator being revered is giving me some demigod vibes.
---
yeah i know, cant imagine parry hasted a few times is more than getting crit on purpose
---
If you're alliance then consider going for Bonebiter at L34 (Scarlet Monastery quest). Otherwise, as early as possible, because WWA or Bonebiter is essentially good enough to carry you to L60. Your team needs to be able to solo a L40ish elite for WWA.
---
Anal [Dirge]
---
 still quite fun in group of rogues to troll and rob those who collect devilsaurs skins
---
omg screenshots of the day, i totally forgot that and loved checking those out
---
Do the racials really make any actual difference for pvp? Its just a tiny boost in sword or axe skill isn't it? What if your undead? or anything else?
---
He's unlocking his true potential
---
I only raided nax on a private server but sure I don’t know about raiding. I forgot dps is imperative to a tank over living, you right. Healers need to focus on that damage output too. I think we need more human priests for that mace bonus to pump up that auto attack dps.
---
I mean, you're not wrong but there are relevant details that I feel are missing there.
---
The Dark Iron Dwarves really have a knack for architecture!
---
sharding helps with ghost town issue. I feel like people who said otherwise dont understand how sharding works
---
Either is fine. The ws makes up for the lack of bonus dodge so it's up for debate as to which is really better (but I suspect humans are slightly better tanks tbqh).

Typical raid night early on. The first shot is of me seeing Rag for the first time, the second two are from a raid when the server crashed and dumped every person in Molten Core in to Stonetalon. A big rez sickness fight ensued.

A shot of my rogue. Notice the chin clipping through the helm. I decided to pick the undead male that had the broken chin and it would clip through everything.
---
I have more, but I'm just trying to find decent copies of them. Lost most of them when xfire shut down.

---
It's the same for leveling. The best gear comes from group content.
---
Gear doesn't really matter for leveling anyway.
---
And the time you spend leveling gets infinitely smaller compared to the time you spend not leveling.
---
I can't pull a solution to that out of my ass. Classic had quite some low level items that were really really good. Such as Lionheart helmet or this lvl42 trinket that gave you a 2% chance to double attack.
---
Druid here. I always buff pets.  It is my good deed to make up for pulling with Moon fire as you cast
---
&gt; Which was significantly easier to craft on alliance than on horde.
---
Don’t know what to tell you bud I admitted everything equal in a 1v1 rogue has an edge cause of stealth at that level. Unless you can freeze trap them. Guess I was just better than most of them cause I rarely had trouble with a rogue or anyone in that bracket.
---
I think it would make more sense to have a permanent mail icon on the minimap that you could click to access your mailbox as long as you were in close proximity to a mailbox.
---
Also would have been nice to have some sort of /interact command so you can use flightmasters, AHs, etc. without having to right click through 20 enemy players piling on top of a tiny goblin trying to get you murdered by guards.
---
r/wooosh
---
They can reign it in alright if they avoid global itemization and stick to hand-picked itemization. They could also change some focus of itemization. Make some glass-canon gear with little stamina but higher damage, or vice-versa.
---
I plan on playing warrior tank/dps as well as a bit of pvp.
---
I live in Australia and it will be impossible for me to raid during the regular raid times but I can raid during the regular US times.  So my question is, what is the ping like from Australia (Sydney) to the chigaco servers? And is this ping going impact me a lot? 
---
I played vanilla back in the day but I played a caster and it wasn’t too bad. How will melee go?
---
Tanking for dungeons and maybe off tanking in raids, how crucial is a low ping? 
---
I’m really torn about playing a warrior with a higher ping
---
Thanks! I was pretty set on playing female orc but I have to say all of the male troll animations look fantastic, especially the 2h special animation.
---
Yea I edited that into the title post yesterday, appreciate it though.
---
BfA is designed to appeal to the most casual audience possible, I don't think they share the same design philosophy when it comes to classic.
---
A few reasons really. 1. Most big streamers that were in WoW had stopped playing it, for example Asmon started playing Dark Souls and only came back to WoW for the Classic Beta. Preach has been playing Sekiro, among other games.  
---
2. Since the world isn't open in retail, the fans can't physically run into  the streamers. Due to sharding, unless you actually group with the Streamer, you have a very small chance of seeing them, since sharding throws you around in different instances of the same zone at a coin toss. A group could form to kill a world boss in your zone and because of that traffic of people, you could be moved from your shard to another, for example.
---
In Classic, you can tune into the stream, see that the streamer is in Ironforge, for example, and then go there and actually see them, follow them and so on. Just see the things Asmon is doing in Classic beta already for proof of how many people are ALREADY following him and that's in the very limited invite beta.
---
Yes and no. I think there are several aspects which don't fit to your description. Many old players will return and maybe they won't ask for quest item locations, but they will ask for help. Even if they are in a group, they will invite stranger, just to make the game progress easier for an hour or two. This happened several times to me years ago and is still happening on some servers today, because you can still level faster in a group. Yes, LFG with ilvl and spec is more convenient. But I found a group every time in the last two years with my not so high ilvl chars, when I wanted to. Even for mythic+ I found groups, without having to post my achievements. So please stop bragging about social norms, just because it's an easy excuse for not getting invited the first time asking.
---
Wait, it isnt? Oh shoot. It's still a cool picture of onyxia though.
---
SFK was actually amazing and had the best caster loot. Could have done without the silencing ghosts though. I will say though that they taught me core mechanics at such an early level; heal from as far away as possible, and pull them into cleared rooms.
---
If you want Jack of all trades go druid it is the only healer that works as a hybrid in pve. Other then that it comes down to how and what you want to play like in pvp for example I feel that prists have a more aggressive play style whit offensive dispelling and mana burn while paladins are mor defensively orientated. In pve especially while levelling there is the mele/range thing it is alot easier to do some extra dps in dungeons/raids as a priest whit a wand. When it comes to survivability they are pretty close a paladin will survive better vs a melee but not by much. (If you play a dwarf or human that is). In raids there is alot of difference in gameplay paladins are mostly spamming one spell at 2-3 ranks where as a priest have a plethora of spells and rank to choose from making it slightly more challenging to be a top performer. As for classes as a priest go human or dwarf dwarf gets fear ward and stone form and humans get extra spirit and stealth detection and not to be forgotten extra rep. They both get instant self heal. As paladin it is stone form as dwarf or stealth detection and rep as human.

---

---
How vain.
---
yes, I can remember all the names of guild mates from way back then.  Second char was of course easier and I am certain 3 months real time won't be the case this time either
---
Sure but in vanilla the powercreep after BWL gets a bit insane because they tried to fix the itemization ( like t3 sets ) and it was fine for the end of a game before the TBC reset launch.
---
But this time is a bit problematic if they add new content, or they just add very little itm lvl so they can still play around or it will be a bit tricky
---
Nevertheless using not used asset like Hyjal or Crater would be fine even with bonkers powercreep level
---
You litterally asked a question that was answered it's not misinformation if it's on VOD
---
Thats what 1% of the osrs playerbase was acting like. Its unsustainable

It's like we have the same mind.

Muh Warrior privileges:
---
- Slowest class to level
---
- You are forced into one role when doing dungeons before level 60
---
- Bad solo farming capabilities
---
- Worst solo PvP class
---
While all Warrior specs are viable for different roles, respeccing gets expensive quickly, so unless you buy gold from China or have thousands of mouthbreathers donating gold for you as a streamer, you won’t be able to experience every aspect of the class. And even if you focus of just one or two, it will take lots of hard work and dedication.

Lol what? I'm asking for streamer recommendations. It's a buyer's market when there are hundreds of them. I don't owe them respect or anything else. They are offering what they've got in a public market, so why would a post like this surprise you? Seems like the tone of my post made you dislike me, whatever, or maybe I voiced my dislike for a streamer you enjoy? Either way, don't be offended at the opinion of a stranger on the internet. Look at how petty your comment is.
---
You right

They are not, only good ones are as mentioned engineering and alchemy and of those to you really only need engineering personally.
---
&gt; What's it like to pick the most boring possible class race combo?

The irony is that this boring combo guy is usually the one complaining about alliance getting another horse mount while horde gets a wolf or a scorpion
---
All I can say is if you're a Night Elf then pick up the quest 'Cave Mushrooms' in Darkshore - it ties the Crown of the Earth quests into the Ashenvale quests and makes it feel like there's a seamless quest chain running through the first three zones!

DPS meters barely ever consider downtime. If they worked truly as people suggest they work (divide total damage dealt by the duration of the fight), then according to this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWkxQE0J1fY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWkxQE0J1fY) Pudgy should have 422 DPS (rounded up (149624 / 355)). I mean that sounds pretty weak doesnt it? Warriors usually hit 1k DPS in Naxxramas, yet the leading warrior has 527 DPS (rounded up (Quick sidenote: on NostalGeek, Judgment of Crusader only Works half of the time, and Pudgy had some bad RNG with resists). Not even the ignite bugged mage has 1k dps (828 DPS rounded down), and mages hit 1k dps as well in Naxx. I thought it was obvious that the actual ingame DPS meters are extremely off, which is why total damage dealt is usually a more precise way to measure damage.
---
Kinda want to see how many more times you can ask this only to have someone answer it by not actually answering it. 
---
(I didn’t know this was a thing btw, so also curious)
---
Professions (gathering at first) and grinding/farming are pretty much your only options. If you are familiar with the economy, playing the AH can make you a buck, but that's more for later down the line. As at first people have very little gold to spend there. But you can make some good g if you are looking at it long term (buy items that go up in price later for cheap now). But this won't help you pay for your first mounts!
---
There are actually tons and tons of guides out there on how to make money in Vanilla/Classic.
---
No, but he plays on EU.
---
I remember palomino was a pretty popular one
---
Warlock : the safe bet. Easy leveling solo, great DPS in raid, no need to farm the mount.
---
Shaman : the wild pick. Ok leveling, must play horde that you don't know as much as ally. Cons is according to veterans, only heal is good in raid and PvP. The other 2 are probably viable but this can be harder.
---
The division isn't exactly a game model you want to replicate, and PoE has pretty ridiculous scaling, hence why seasons are a thing in that game.
---
Power creep is inevitable, and teirs will eventually be obsolete, its apart of WoW and yes, was even a part of vanilla. However on retail raid teirs are obsolete the second a new one comes out apart from rolling a titanforge on a BiS trinket.
---
Hi, /u/Nenharm, your post has been removed as it is seems to be talking about the current stress test. Please use the current [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bui555/stress_test_2_the_megathread_of_omg_why_can_i_not/) instead.
---
Ok. They must have said it and I missed it. Mom going on that he's not in school and not working led me to believe he was free loading on the parent(s).
---
This really looks a lot more like failure with the parenting than anything.
---
since the blue post confirming some of the change in hit tables from private servers, there's been talk that an old, disregarded weapon skill calculation may actually be what Classic will run off of. Here's the github where people are looking into such things: https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/issues/5#issuecomment-497167237
---
tl;dr is that weapon skill may cap out on reducing glancing damage at 308 and reduce it to a cap of 5% reduction instead of eventually reaching 0% reduction. it'll be interesting to see how it all shakes out!
---
Dirge is a tbc item tho.

Good to know! Thanks! It seems fun to play a class that takes more tactics due to not having a panic button like vanish or frost

Could add in gear with glyph-like effects. Trinkets or Idols/Totems/Relics for classes that add minor buffs to spells (perhaps tailored to the raid they drop in) like the major glyphs did.

Unlikely

try to intercept a single enemy or a critter that's 25 yards away from where you are being zerged
---
Okay so a rule of thumb, then, if I see a same lvl player I should as a warrior attempt to strike/charge first to increase my chances of winning the fight?
---
There will 100% be addons with proper LFG tools to find dungeons and everything, we all know it.
---
being real isn't rude it's being respectful.
---
This. Also try not to go strictly zone after zone. Especially when leveling horde in zones like the barrens. Try to explore the world as you follow leads between different zones.
---
Personally I was thinking you should tune Hellfire down to 50 and make it al alternate pathway for leveling.  At a launch you’d still have all 60s flying (as in quickly, not air-flying) through the questing content and any alts would have a clear go a bit after launch.  Tune all the raids to 60 with obvious dependencies on needing to gear up.  You could also tune the raids to be 40 man, although, Kara would be way too cramped for that.
---
As for anything else to change, you hit most of the nails on the head.  I always thought the class exclusivity was super important for faction identity.
---
You’d have to put in some extra flight/quest paths though to get to the areas intended for flying only.
---
Alternatively, they could put in a system where you “rent” a flying mount from a flight master and it works as it did if it were your mount but, once you get off, the mount goes away and you’re stuck wherever you landed.  Suicide jump or ground mount up and run away, doesn’t matter, you can’t fly back.
---
You would silence your own community? Even though I think these streamers are lame, I wouldn't dream of censoring any of them.
---
Wheres the fun when you get so much for free, I didn't think soda would do things like that, thanks for sharing it dude
---
if you stare at the water in beta or retail for a while you'll get it. mostly the first 2 things though.
---
if glancing blow reduction caps out at 308 like the theories go, then edgemaster's on top of your latent 305 skill actually won't be all that good anymore. it would only reduce the average glancing by an additional 10% at the cost of stats that other gloves could provide
---
I bet there will be a ton of Ret paladins from Retail in for a rude awakening in Classis ..
---
Generally druid and warlock are considered less popular classes. Warlocks more so on Alliance side, due to the Will of the Forsaken racial undead have.
---
Australian guilds can clear naxx on EU pservers with the entire raid at 300+ ms. I played rogue and paladin on US servers in retail until wod when we finally got Aus servers. It's completely playable but annoying in PvP.

Yes you're right, him farming all his gear, mining nodes in Duskwood and levelling engineering is on VOD.

Like i know he gets shit for free, im aware. But the sheer amount of time he has played has already put him ahead of most people in the beta regardless. It's not like he didn't work for any of it.

Nowhere in your post is raiding gear excluded. You just say "crafted gear should be buffed" in the title. You say you get a good robe at endgame then just say "the rest of the stuff is average". How am I supposed to know that doesn't include other 60 items..? There's no point having a discussion with you when you don't even know what point you're trying to make in the first place, I cba any more. Have a good one.
---

---
When it comes to dungeon and raid content, isn’t classic much more casual?
---
"Exactly" I can't say, it's just what I've heard when I tuned in. Actual screaming/shouting through my headphones and into my ears.
---
Is that baby from Alterac?
---
Nothing about leveling as holy is "of course". You know you can heal dungeons in every spec no problem while leveling?
---
Some warriors like to have their stances as separate buttons and then their action bars change to match the new skillset (like a rogue stealthing or a druid changing forms). Others dont like their action bars changing and instead put every ability on their bars and macro the stance specific ones (overpower or disarm for example) so that when you need to use intercept for example, it changes you to berserker stance if you aren't already in it on the first key press, and casts intercept on the second key press. This is what I prefer, but it does require more keybinds and a bit of setting up to do.

---
[This sums up my feelings about the stress test closing](https://youtu.be/07W6OXxnIdA)
---
A lot of people have the same feelings that people have about classic as they do about TBC. It was my first “true” step into WoW. I played until 50 and hit the wall in vanilla (a month or two before TBC came out). I love TBC but I also get the hype and excitement around Classic. I’d love to relive classic and some of the memories I do have with it. I have those same nostalgic feelings about TBC though. 
---
That being said, I’d much prefer a horizontal move with the addition of arenas and “ranked” rbgs. I don’t know what the formatting would look like, but rank 14 arenas would be cool. I’d say keep out flying mounts or “fix” them. Possibly a CD like a hearthstone. I get the loss of immersion but it was cool to adventure up to floating islands and certain inaccessible areas on your own without an NPC guiding you and still fits in the fantasy lore of the game. 
---
Would I be mad or upset if those features aren’t added? Nah prolly not. They’re just suggestions and I think many of the good things with all the different expansions of retail could be added without breaking immersion. I’ve heard other good suggestions about achievements being a kind of tapestry in a guild hall (similar to the old garrisons). Once again, less immersion breaking. I think better graphics in a horizontal move makes sense as well. But this is honestly just my
---
opinion. I also understand the no changes side. Love to hear what you guys think.

14 is inside the 10-19 bracket.

Hello and good morning! My question is will a night elf warrior(prot) with blacksmithing will be able to compete against a human warrior(prot) with engineering for raid spots. I understand the mechanics of min/max and the importance of holding threat so your Dps can unleash the beast. Do you think this will be a crucial “omg you are not a human and you don’t have engineering; sorry you can’t go.” Moment ? I want to raid a lot
---
I would rate the horse population on moonglade much higher than just 3 per 100
---
I like.
---
Ultimate support class!
---
Currently trying to decide if I want to play as warrior tank or rogue in classic (rogue was my main until wotlk, so there's the nostalgia factor).
---
I read a couple of times how useless prot warriors are outside of group content/raids, but I also know that a lot of classic endgame consists of various (mostly solo) farming activities... so how viable is playing pure prot in the end for someone who's not sure yet if he wants to raid on classic or not? I don't want to respec all the time for farming.. :-)
---
&gt;It would automatically have a much higher population than the standard server and in that regard, it could also have the snowball effect of people snowballing into those servers just because it has more people.
---
I am asking why this doesn't happen on retail. All the Full servers are pretty much streamer free. (Big streamer, as in streamers who do it as a comfortable living, not just randoms who happen to stream once and a while)

Outlands destroying Azeroth.
---
In vanilla you *had* to return to Elwynn Forest/Mulgore once a month atleast for Darkmoon Faire.
---
To STV every 3 days of ZG.
---
To BRM every 7days for MC/BWL.
---
To Andorhal for scholomance runs to craft flasks if BWL isnt out or hasnt been cleared yet or hasnt be progressed.
---
To Felwood for Whipper Root Tubers.
---
To Scarlet Monastery for Grave Moss.
---
To Arathi Highlands shipwreck area for Tidal Charm.
---
As a level 60 you traverse Azeroth several times a week and go to obscure parts of the world.
---
In TBC all this is not needed anymore and the world in Outlands is simply flown over.

Definately no letting each faction have Shaman and Paladins but for me it was the killing of Illidan and Kael'thas. Neither were evil or under the legions grasp bjt thats exactly what TBC had you believe and then it got retconned into Legion where we go, "Oh yeah Illidan was actually just pretending to be evil to fight against the Burning Crusade. Kael'thas? Nah fuck him.
---
Why? That 15% applies to both of them.
---
Weapon skill makes that easier, which in turn gives more room for do to go higher.
---
Because TBC is a better game...by certain metrics.
---
Nothing anywhere has ever come close to vanilla's world building.  The organic integration of quests, zones, dungeons and characters that make the world live.  Gnomergan, Zul'Farak, even Sunken Temple are *world design* wise far superior to TBC dungeons, and incomparably better than anything from WOTLK on where they just turned them in to loot pinata gauntlets. 
---
That said, TBC had the better class design and game play than vanilla, and it did so by a similar margin.  I played every class except Mage to 60, and geared them in blue gear with Priest getting AQ 40 gear, and warrior getting BWL gear, assorted bits and pieces for the dpsers.
---
In TBC I switched to horde and played  Priest, Paladin, Hunter, and Druid to 70 pre-raid bis.  with hunter getting first tier raid geared.  
---
Paladin and Druid and Hunter were all three light years ahead gameplay wise.  
---
Shadow priest was also waaaaay better.   healing was changed a little but about the same as much fun. 
---
If they re-imagine TBC with no Flying mounts, and spend a year or two... deepening the lore...  
---
TBC still has a facade of vanilla's world integration, it just needs more Easter eggs and deeper less obvious connection to make the whole thing feel more real, maybe some work on the dungeons to make them feel more integrated with their zones and less linear. 
---
I will have loads of fun in Vanilla, and if they never progress past it, I will wander off and leave after a year or two leaving behind a sad aging community of die hards like Ultima Online or Everquest's original servers.

To be fair, I've played a holy paladin 1-80 at the start of every expansion....
---
My play style of holy was always to be the agressive healer would knew how much he could handle healing and pull way more than the tank or dps wanted to. It would definitely speed dungeons along and quickly these guys would learn my pace and be grateful for it.

Dirge is organic because it came from BS spamming recipes, though.

You're just ranting about a bunch of different points. 1.) If Hollywood cant stop piracy no one can. 2.) just because a company sends a C&amp;D doesn't mean anything, I could send one to any company in the world for any reason. 3.) pirate bay is a pretty small part of internet piracy, Russia and china are much bigger sources. 4.) just like pirate bay, if one site falls down another will rise, in fact if blizz goes after pservers often that will mean we will always have fresh servers which would be nice. 5.) with classic wow coming out that mean we can actually collect data to make pservers better. Pservers have been around since 2006 at least because that is when I played on my first one. They arnt going anywhere and will in fact get better.
---
we definitely are not lol. It's a sheer numbers game
---
Anddddd I'm back to square one
---
I won't consider specs that just choose one talent over another if it doesn't drastically change the playstyle as "different". I also don't consider PVP specs because it's too subjective.
---
Druids have 1 viable end-game spec (Resto).
---
Hunters have 1 viable end-game spec (MM).
---
Mages have 2 viable end-game specs (Frost &amp; Fire), but can't use Fire for the first two raids.
---
Paladins have 1 viable end-game spec (Holy).
---
Priests have 2.5 viable end-game specs (Holy, Disc, and Shadow) (I only give shadow a 0.5 because if there's another shadow in the raid already, you shouldn't be shadow).
---
Rogues have 3 viable end-game specs (Combat Daggers, Combat Swords, and Seal Fate Daggers).
---
Shaman have 1 viable end-game spec (Resto).
---
Warlocks have 2 viable end-game specs (Affliction and Demo).
---
Warriors have 2 viable end-game specs (Fury and Prot).
---
Many games use cosmetics or some sort of prestige system (which to me is just another cosmetic).  It certainly keeps people interested.  Why not Classic WoW?
---
[Comps like beast cleave were a thing in wotlk. Cata just didnt fix any of the damage issues.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q5pb-fEQhs) TBC did have its fair share of dalies but the game wasnt exactly balanced around it. Really the most egregious example would be isle of quel'danas but with that the island was small enough that you wanted to group up to avoid getting ganged up on in pvp. It was a bit frustrating with all the dalies but you also had to deal with the other players which helped distract you from doing the same quests over and over. Compared to a similar update in WoW, the argent tournament and you end up having to do frustrating dalies that involve a frustrating minigame that doesn't have anything to do with the rest of the game. 
---
Resto druids were strong in tbc theres no denying it but there is a big difference between having a bad matchup against DKs and being completely obliterated by them. Just look at how many resto druids got gladiator is season 5, it was a big fuck you to anyone who had enjoyed the class. It didn't help that death knights where literally everywhere either.
---
 RMP and comps similar where still a thing in wotlk but again why bother with playing a high skill cap comp when you can just run dk comps or just pick a comp that can burst someone down in a single stun. Theres a reason why people would meme about dying in strangulates. 
---
Wotlk had its moments but it completely destroyed any sense of skill in pvp. And to further prove my point just look at what happened to the esport scene during wotlk. It was when WoW had its most subscriber count but the competitive arena scene barely survived the xpac.

Let's downgrade our broadband and home PC set up and get the old CRT monitor out of storage for the full vintage appeal.
---
Not like he’s fighting anyways, swear this guy constantly watches vanilla PvP videos and says how much he can’t wait, but most of the time he sits in bear standing still watching Ziqo and Ven kill everyone next to him
---
I can't keep my focus for 12 hours. I wouldn't trust anyone to have that capability. I guess it would be okay for a cashier, but would you really want a surgeon to dig into you after he's been at work for 10+ hours?
---
Believe me I know, I had the quest half completed but then we wiped and trash started respawning and wasn't about to do it again for a dagger with exactly the same stats (top end dgm etc) but 1.50 speed instead of 2.00 in MH.
---
Yep, the crafted loot tables, with few notable exceptions, are pretty much straight out of beta. Sets like heavy scarped and tough scorpid reflect a world that pre-dates the 5 second rule. Blacksmithing weapons are generally worse than the quest and random green drops available at a given range.
---
Tailoring particularly struggles from the lack of specializations. Smithing and leatherwork can handle a larger crafter population by splitting them into specializations, tailoring otoh is flooded with crafters destroying the value of the profession.
---
Criticism: OK
---
Rage / Hate threads and personal attacks: Yea should be moderated. They don't add anything useful and just continue to drive the negativity in this sub for no reason. 
---
I'd be fine with it if they created a flair or tag for 'Streamer hate' that I could filter, but as it stands I am tired of seeing every other post be about how terrible streamers are and how they are just shitty human beings. The constant negativity gets old.
---
Either moderate it or allow me to filter it, I don't really care which, just tried of the children constantly bitching and moaning.
---
I was playing Stress Test from Finland and I got 110-115ms. I would say that's playable though you will be at a disadvantage in PVP and a bit also in PVE if you aren't using a lag compensation cast bar.
---
That ping is normal for me for other games too.
---
What was ping like on retail for you?
---
hard yikes from me dawg.
---
If you're gunna be wrong at least don't speak so confidently
---
Jesus I’ve never seen this either. Thanks for telling where it is
---
There are myriad gameplay reasons that pservers are vastly different than vanilla but more importantly the population dynamics are different, and the culture and knowledge level of the community is very different.
---
There are issues with Vanilla that you're unlikely to have even seen on a pserver, and you never experienced the full chronology of patches that vastly changed the game from launch to the version played on most pservers / classic. 
---
No disagreement with your second point. Vanilla can't be replicated even if they had the exact client. Classic isn't Vanilla either.
---
Last point is demonstrably not true. Sub numbers speak for themselves. When people hate the direction the game is going, they stop playing. BC ushered in a massive boom in subscribers because it made the game more playable for more people. 
---
The biggest truth that's super hard for younger people to accept is that WoW has always been a very casual MMO. Anyone who played MMOs before it knew that, and it was commonly ridiculed for that. 
---
BC took steps that allowed people to experience the actual content. They sacrificed some things to do that, but the game was getting too big for Vanilla to sustain...it was abundantly clear even at the time. 
---
They did the right thing.
---
A taste of the true Vanilla experience.
---
It doesn't, it shows in spellbook. I only had 12%
---
I thank.
---
yeah seriously, i'm keepin my eyes peeled on this one
---
Alliance lock? Good luck with half of the Horde being Undead.
---
Jesus Christ man, thanks for that. Also mad props for actually answering my question and being open minded - I never was suggesting it's better than arms in any sense, i was just messing around with a way to make it work. Viable, not optimal.
---
That's cool. I was unsure about the viability of the disarm, went for sunder armour as i liked the idea of amping my dps' damage to the target, and i figured that disarm was long enough base with 10 seconds. although i've not actually played Classic high end enough to know how much of a difference it makes yet. I completely get that change.
---
I like the Overpower talent. The only reason i was thinking that it would be better to go for charge over that was because of the rage generation - i figured i'd charge in and maybe sunder armour, battle shout or hamstring then swap to defensive stance, so any chance i would get to use overpower i would be using revenge instead. However, i guess it could work for like a finishing off the target type deal? I like it.
---
Yeah my train of thought was like a warsong gulch type deal of being a nuisance. I don't want to have like a hail mary kill people, i wanna enable my damage, peel for flag carriers, and CC/annoy the shit outta the enemies. Revenge stun and the extra stun seemed really good.
---
I think the other comments have pointed to it as well, despite the dislike for it. But rage generation seems to be the biggest problem. I like the Fury build a lot, piercing howl  would be great and the extra fury on hit would be needed. But i think that Tactical Mastery and Anger Management are just too good to pass up on. Although that Fury build looks very similar to what i originally looked at.
---
That mountain king build looks really cool. I'd love to try that. Shield Bash made sense due to thematic and i liked the dispell effect, however that build seems really great and i'd love to try it out.
---
Also holy shit that edit. I really appreciate you taking it seriously.
---
12% and opportunity, tried remorseless attacks but it didn't really work consistent in pvp
---
Lol they didn't get source code from a private server
---
The boss having a significantly higher avoidance isn't really gonna have positives
---
Not sure why you want to keep the level cap at 60, I mean yes having the level cap raise 10 levels each time was a mistake in the long run but condensing Outlands to 50-60 does not solve it imo. I'd say make it 55-65 and it could work and then have each expansion only increase by 5.
---
It still doesn't solve the reset each expansion gives you. I've seen discussions on moving away from a level and gear dependant system for instance if anyone ever played Mortal Online. Good game but too many problems on launch and too long to polish it.
---
You realise we can't actually see what your monitor looks like, right? You're capturing raw input. Literally doesn't matter what monitor you have, it doesn't have any effect on footage you record unless it's with an actual camera
---
gnome's escape artist is a game changer.  A dwarf's stoneform is also useful.
---
How long was the actual fight? And how much damage did that person do for that fight?
---
I mean yeah itd true that you will have an easier time in dungeons, you're just gonna be slow at everything else which is porbably gonna be 90% of your playtime
---
It's [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]
---
\*ackshuallyyyyy
---
Didn't happen to me atleast, I heard reports of it happening but it was definitely not the case most of the time.
---
TBC raiding was definitely far ahead of classic. Was great.
---
A girl in my guild earned her fortune with mooncloth. She sponsored many epic mounts for guildies. All she required was all your runecloth and felcloth drops in exchange.
---
You know, I was so happy on my last private server to FINALLY GET the carrot!? What did the tool tip says analogous:
---
Not wearable for characters after 60/70!
---
Damn, it was a WotLk server.
---
😂😂😂😂
---
It's kinda like the whole "IS THAT A SUPRA?!" thing.
---
I would say Mara is really where I came into my own as a healer, so that helped for sure. Doing some farming runs of Scarlet Monastery with one friend and focusing entirely on keeping them alive, that too. Uldaman is just packed with lore, and it was fascinating, figuring things out about where Dwarves came from (I then feel the titan lore reached its peak in Northrend but then there was nowhere to go with it and retcons ruined it)
---
What's with the cost? I stated that they would be reusing assets. If there was a large enough audience I could imagine it being a thing.
---
Also, maybe the word seasonal is wrong, I'm more so alluding to a a current expansion time frame. I just say seasonal because it gives the idea that all new expansions would be fresh.
---
/r/lostredditors
---
Just a question from a usual caster main: What's the actual combat like?
---
I don't play warr in vanilla cause it seems to be it's just auto attack / hamstring spamming. It's kinda jarring to be reliant on auto attacks but the swing takes forever to come out and the damage isn't synced with the animation well either. I want to roll warr to frontline on my alt for once but idk if it's a nice choice.
---
Because TBC was vanilla without much of the nonsense. I love vanilla but things like 2 hour long cool downs are ridiculous.
---
if gronkh would play classic, people would flood his server too. he streams fridays with ~25k viewers. not as big as the big US streamers, but big enough for significant impact on server population. iirc he's not sure about playing classic.
---
A better designed pvp ranking system.
---
To play devil's advocate, the people complaining about sharding is exactly why we are getting layering instead. The concept behind layering seems to allow the same benefits as sharding, while removing the adverse affects.
---
Tf? Not green enough
---
&gt; Alliance doesn't always have it since it balances out every 7 or so hours
---
Alliance does always have it.
---
It balances once a week on Tuesday reset.
---
The reason why Alliance always has it is because the ratio of Horde to Alliance is somewhere in the ballpark of 8-10:1.
---
Not really. Just tired of seeing the same exact bitching and moaning in every other post about streamers. 
---
Sub is turning into /r/streamerhatecirclejerk
---
I didn't even say it should be banned, those are you're words. I'd settle for a new tag / flair called 'streamer hate' so I could at least filter it out.
---
wrong sub reddit
---
Well, even Mike Morhaime joked about that in blizzcon, minutes before giving him his job :p
---
Yeah, madseason started streaming and it's been wonderful. Hes chill, his chat is chill, and it feels like a buncha friends. Kinda rare for twitch sometimes.
---
If you want to Priest make sure it is to heal. Might be obvious, but while Shadow was kinda-sorta sometimes brought after the 16x slot increase for VE/Shadow Weaving it wasn't super standard. BC is where Shadow went from rare to "super OP" in raids due to VT.    
---
In PvP Priests are super powerful **as part of a group** meaning with someone watching your back. The only defensive/escape ability Blizzard gave Priests was a gimp Fear on a 30 second cooldown, then balanced the game around Warlock's Fear with no cooldown (meaning good luck fearing that Undead player ever, they'll have two~three ways to break it). So all you can do is take the bubble talents, keep a bubble up, and pray that someone saves your butt.
---
lol, what? in every wsg premade theres a resto shaman, theyre godlike for pvp.
---
It's not a net positive no. On private servers you don't get the parry speed increase. On Classic you will. So while bosses will be parrying more on Classic, they will also do more damage which means more threat. So it's not just 9% less threat, it's not that much.
---
Or just make a dedicated trolling guild
---
I bet your keyboard is filthy..
---
This. The greatest insult to the world was cata because at that point the only way to experience original Azeroth was through pservers.
---
Not cool at all. Keep that shit to ARPGs
---
Dude, you're being overly aggressive for something I've read here and there and found it, in my opinion, to be more left-leaning.  When an article starts off with ”So &amp; so says this and twitter is blah blah blah.”  it's very much a left publication.  Friends of mine that are right leaning or full-right are not in the slightest interested in Twitter.  
---
To be fair, I am not a liberal or a conservative, but I don't care for any of the daily mails articles that appear here in the US as most of them are absolute garbage.  Almost tabloid-esque if you will.  I didnt mean to aggravate you by stating my opinion, but it's definitely cleared some things up lol.
---
Almost certain there is no vote to kick back then.
---
Rogue and mage come to mind. A rogue can solo multiple players in PvP with the use of engineering gadgets and blinds etc. 
---
A skilled mage is probably unbeatable versus most damaging classes, especially frost spec. 3 minute PoM mage could be fun too
---
for shame I am still a keyboard turner ..ding ding shame ...
---
Kinda difficult quest at lvl 10 for a 39 armor +3 int belt. But yea I guess it wouldve been 10 armor more. I was really hoping for a 1 agi 1 stam belt I saw someone having to appear on the AH
---
That won't happen just because of the simple fact that it's not twitch chat... People will be focused one playing the game, not sit in IF and spam the chat. 
---
Pretty absurd suggestion imo xD
---
Not as much as his haha
---
He never played vanilla.
---
The Ice Age happened when Chuck Norris frost shocked a charging mammoth.
---
Basically don’t be a warlock. Too much threat as horde, die a lot as alliance.... play a mage.
---
We see on private servers strong community and communication with people asking questions and asking for help. Safe to say it will be the same on live servers imo.
---
&gt; Look at how petty your comment is.
---
Still not as petty as you making fun of streamers before asking for recommendations. 
---
If you haven't noticed, there are parallels between the things you listed streamers do and your original post. 
---
&gt;Tuned into Asmongold to watch him throw a temper tantrum over a Gurubashi Arena chest, then beg his fan guild/stream for gold for his BiS necklace only to be reminded to thank the guy who gave him 25g. Totally arrogant, talks like a chud.
---
Opened this thread to see you insult streamers, then ask for recommendations. Only to be reminded to thank everybody with their recommendations, because the only comments you are replying to are about the streamers you insulted. Makes me wonder what the real point of this thread was. Totally arrogant.
---
&gt;sodapoppin, he is the Ninja of WoW streamers in terms of holding the top spot all the time and also being insufferable.
---
If he is insufferable maybe you two are a good match, give him a try.
---
&gt;Saw KingGothalian streaming to 2,000 people and laughed at his inevitable decline.
---
hehe funny xd.
---
&gt;What streamers for this game, classic in particular, are worth our attention?
---
And finishing that off with holding yourself higher than most streamers. Great post dude, keep it up! Not insufferable at all
---
xani is actually insane guarding the wsg flagroom. Good rogue
---
I logged off pre-cata at the secret village south of Silithis. (You had to follow the shore in Tanaris south around Ungoro) When I logged back in I was in Darnasis.
---
That got real old real fucking quick in Vanilla.
---
Are you still eating little  Ion Hazzikostas?
---
This
---
I hear you... but finally make a cut for three branches:
---
Casual, Hardcore ... aaand SOFTCORE!
---
Pve dps is lots of whirlwind/bloodthirst spam and execute spam. Pvp is hamstring/MS.
---
Still very satisfying but it comes down to what playstyle you like most. For pvp and warrior it's about forcing the other person to hang around while you bash their face in.
---
If it's white and not wearable it's usually a trade good and can be sold. You really have to be counting the coppers. Don't vendor all that wolf meat, someone needs it for leveling cooking.
---
IIRC Nixxiom is from USA
---
yay thanks for more back around info &lt;3
---
I got a quest to go deliver something to the Loch on the little priest i made on the stress test.  Figured 'hey, fuck it.  Might as well do some exploring'.  I had actually forgotten that the Loch was one of the big things i was most looking forward to seeing again in Classic until i was coming through the tunnel into the zone.  Went and turned in the quest, and then ran right for town and down to the water.
---
I was slightly sad i couldnt actually see the 'whole thing' because of the haze, though that probably does make the world seem bigger/more impressive.  It was right at sunset in game, though...and it was stunningly beautiful.  
---
Ugh, is it August yet? D:
---
auction house is my jam, but it takes (a long) time to be good at it, you need to know why and when certain items will go up and down in price
---
Making a game or a new expansion is more than just using old assets. 
---
BASICALLY You are asking for new expansion without totally new content and "deleting" old progress, or am i wrong?
---
For many people (including me) it's important to carry their character to the next adventure. 
---
You have a ton of people playin since vanilla with their exact character. So basically you want a new game within in wow universe. Why would you infest so much time in wow if it's getting deleted in 2 years. Wow is not diablo.
---
You idea is ok, there is just to much what makes it break for me :b
---
I can’t stand them, either. I do find Esfand knowledgeable and entertaining (though he communicates with Asmon a lot, which is a turn off for me).
---
Kala: a really chill dude and pretty humble.
---
Defcamp: Just started watching a little of him and he seems like a pretty down to earth guy. 
---
Really the only streamers I can tolerate and they don’t rage and scream into the mics, etc.
---
Sticc by non hentai standards
---
It's pronounced “nacht elf” in German which means “night elf”.
---
Flying Mounts were terrible:
---
- No longer having to traverse the terrain, and just puts auto-move on for everything
---
- No longer having to deal with a lot of encounters, since you can fly right over them
---
- World PvP in general suffered a lot from flying
---
Daily bless Omar. Forever the rightful king.
---
Fyi, he's making a funny and I gave a little snort. Well done.
---
Yeah, but instead you'll pay the WoW sub to play classic. That'll show him!
---
39 fire mage was the most fun I've had twinking
---
Had a 19 warrior too which was fun but man...that mage...great times
---
Seeing a lot of talk about keeping the level to 60 and just adding more dungeons/content.  
---
The primary issue - and one of the reasons "ratings" were introduced with TBC / gear had stats converted to +AP from agility etc, instead of keeping the % crit and hit gear, was to avoid having 50% + crit.  
---
Added to that the fact that scaling just works better for some classes than others, you would never get the classes staying the same while adding more gear at 60.
---
The second huge issue: Gear in Classic matters and isn't easy to get. Add more sources for gear - as people are suggesting - will make gear easier to get. Blues / Epics will mean less. Upgrades will no longer feel as meaningful and important.
---
My original post was still correct, there are more US *players* than EU. But someone also mentioned that some countries are not included but still play on their own languages server like Ragnaros for the South Americans.
---
I’m not wrong in my statement, and I’m okay with being shown things I don’t know, your reading comprehension on the other hand is a “yikes”.
---
BTW If you don't want to lose all your karma delete this post, the downvotes will go crazy for any ideas for "what's next"
---
That was never a thing during my time raiding in vanilla and I did everything up to most of AQ and spider wing of Naxx. Maybe if you are to be in some super hardcore min/max guild you may want to consider those things. But outside of that play the race/profession you want. Specs is the only place it’s get iffy since some of them are just a waste of a raid spot and it’s more hurting than helping.
---
designed as in a gameplay sense, not a technical sense.  It's very challenging to design a zone for interesting gameplay with flying like the aforementioned zones were.  I don't think it's a lazy thing as much as a thing that's just really hard to pull off from a gameplay standpoint.
---
Doesn't have to be 3 months. It's a basically a server with a preset time limit or a condition. Its something they could do down the road.
---
They started watering-down the RPG aspects of WoW throughout TBC. Additionally, flying mounts was a thing they added that changed the game in a fundamental way. To your point about LK, the game really went off the rails in that time. It seemed to me that once Kaplan left the team after LK went live, whoever was left in charge made a lot of significant changes that were not in the spirit of the game. Even in the original raid content, it was obvious that things were different
---
You can get quite a bit of progression by e-peening.
---
The MoP challenge runs were really well received. Sprinkle some vanilla lore and RP onto it and it will work great.
---
"Saurfang's axe is imbued with draconic blood enhancing it's power. However due to his many battles it wore off. Now it's on you to collect a phial for he is preoccupied doing Thrall's bidding on fighting the Nightelves of Ashenvale. 
---
Go forth and fill this vessel. But - lo - it loses it's power within a short while."
---
Go kill Drakkisath in 20 minutes in order to succeed in the speedrun.
---
Thanks for the explanation.  So it looks like for tanking gear progression is: High level Quests &gt; BRD &gt; LBRS &gt; Strat Live &gt; Scholo &gt; Strat Dead = UBRS.
---
What server was this on? Grand theft kodo sounds very familiar
---
I hope I find people like you when I start playing.
---
Exactly, which was my point.
---
I couldn't give a shit about karma, honestly I expected the controversy :P
---
Prot gets spots in raids easily if you show that you're willing to get gear and offtank. Usually guilds are happy to have more tanks because that's often where they fall short at least from my experience. Rogues have a better time horde side because less competition for maces and swords.
---
Arms and Arcane aren’t really viable in PVE, they’re both about burst, not sustained damage.
---
he can fly
---
It’s not obvious to me because I literally haven’t clicked on a single thing you have linked. I’m not too interested in the videos. 
---
My only point is that math is not wrong. If you have divided the correct numbers, and the DPS meter is not giving you the same answer. Then the DPS meters are not correctly named or have some sort of issues. 
---
Math is still correct.
---
Vashj EU
---
I always try to buff pets too, if it doesn't happen it's because I'm either out of range as I run by because of oops I'm slow...or I went OOM because buffing fort is expensive
---
I know :)
---
Gotcha, that wasn't clear from the get go lol
---
Always remember to practice safe buffing.
---
Dailies started the sundering for me. Dailies and world quests are interchangable. They push you to log on, they push you to log off when complete. It's a bandaid for people with no time to be social. I get that, but this is a MMO.
---
Outside of a world first guild you'll be fine, but why BS? Are you planning on being the guild armoursmith or weaponsmith?
---
But that's not the point ITT your pointing to something else to argue against what's being discussed. Pure fanboy can't see anything else
---
True, this is more my ideal WoW. I'm not playing Classic WoW for the nostalgia feelings like a lot of people. I'm playing it more so for the RPG elements, so I'm open to new content and losing my previous player progress.
---
I will never understand streamer culture.
---
It's relative both in the ammount of money and the situation you are in.
---
Would you pick a dollar that's covered in dog shit? Some people would, some people wouldn't.
---
Also, some people are so rich and they make so much per hour that even if the dollar is clean in the ground, they won't bother losing time to duck and get it because they'll actually lose money via losing time.
---
There or no horde quests in Loch Modan and to even get to that zone you have to travel through Dun Algaz which is full of higher level Dwaef NPC guards.  Plus, in wetlands, you cant see the dam.  To get this screenshot, you have to jump off the dam in Loch Modan.
---
I played Alliance and dont know a single thing about Swamp of Sorrows or Stonetalon Mountains.
---
It does. Not with streamers though, but with populations based on factions. Some servers have extreme imbalances, simply because that's what people look for. I don't know if I can share the link but:  [https://realmpop.com/eu-tarren-mill.html](https://realmpop.com/eu-tarren-mill.html)   
---
Look at that Alliance - Horde population in Tarren Mill. This is the server Method are currently in, as a WF Horde Guild. Look at  [https://realmpop.com/us-illidan.html](https://realmpop.com/us-illidan.html) , the US Server where Limit are, as a WF Horde guild.
---
Dagger rogues aren't that uncommon. There are viable dagger builds and going daggers reduces your competition for weapons.
---
Play whatever you want, just be aware that if you play druid, priest or shaman and you do want to raid then your raid leader is almost certainly going to ask that you heal.
---
What I meant was as holy I'll likely want to group up while questing
---
The EU streams chats were really friendly until they met the NA premade, and suddenly it was flooded with assholes.
---
Then those who have it in their interest to steer gaming in this direction should join up, enjoy the hell out of Classic, and throw money at Blizzard for it.
---
Meet you there!
---
I'm not sure I agree. I wish I remember how I specced in Vanilla since I PvPed so much I'm sure I figured out which I prefer.
---
The only thing making me consider Anger Management at all is thinking of it in terms of “rounding off” rage between melee hits. For example, if I end up at 27 rage and have to wait for another melee swing to afford Mortal Strike, then if I had Anger Management maybe it would have given me the 3 extra I needed.
---
stam doesn't stack with fortitude, though. maybe that's why he's confused
---
Every bit helps man.
---
Danger Dolan will dominate which ever oceanic realm he picks
---
Pickpocketing gives lots of health potions as well.
---
I'm actually getting a five man together with my wife and our vanilla friends for streaming. Curious to see how many out there want to watch adults play classic wow. To me, I like asmongold, however I have issues with language. Like can we not use sperg or retard to refer to everyone? Its ignorant and silly. I'm not concerned if we dont get alot of followers. We just figure there are lots of folks out there who want to see a 1-60 five man experience with funny content that arent trying to show off neck beard skill. 
---
Tldr: I agree with you, so I'm going to try to provide that to twitch. Unfortunately non of us have beta, so we wait till release.
---
oh no shit, i didnt know that
---
My hottest of takes is that ToC was a fun little raid. Maybe I'm just biased because I had the mace on my druid and loved healing twin valks with it, but I liked all the bosses in there. I hated ICC. 
---
Ulduar is my favorite raid for sure but I actually agree with BT or Sunwell era being the pinnacle of this type of MMO. 
---
My problem with Wrath overall is that it introduced the obsession with story, to the point where Arthas had to show up every few levels to remind you of how fuckin special you were. 
---
It also introduced a hero class that was completely broken, which resulted in an utterly disastrous PvP season (5).
---
Pretty much the same story for me.  I started during the Ulduar patch, but holy shit am i excited to see all these zones again.  I was an altoholic from very early on, so i saw a fair amount of the Classic zones (especially the Eastern Kingdoms iirc).  It wasnt until i started messing around on the stress test that i truly appreciated how much i want to see that all again, though.  I was looking forward to it, but after seeing a taste of it....fuuuuuuuuuuck its going to be hard to wait 3 more months D:
---
I was actually semi-tempted to look up a Wrath PS, but i just flat out dont want to play on those.  Someday i kind of hope Blizz makes official BC/Wrath servers, though i know if it happens it'll be quite a while :(
---
Oh well.  Soon ill have Classic to eat up all of my time :)
---
The alliance is even better because gnomes have higher engineering skill which allows getting more items with 30lvl cap.
---
I never at all said anything was wrong with those small changes. I was replying to someone who said "there are simply no Qol changes". There are obviously many QoL changes. They are great.   
---
You misread my comment.   
---
He said "there are no QOL changes" and I pointed out some.
---
This happened to me all the time. Thanks for the laugh.
---
**AAAaaAaaAaaHh!** Ishnu Allah weary traveler!
---
&gt;  I would just grind dudes
---
I remember that. I remember thinking, it was just an announcement for a Warcraft 3 battle chest, possibly a collector's edition type item. I wasn't interested, I just wanted to play War3.
---
I \*also\* remember when the WoW site first went up, and it was mainly empty except for journals from Brann Bronzebeard. For some reason, that was what hooked me; I kept reading his journals over and over again (even though he only had like three or four).
---
Up to you, but in high end gear sword is better, because you can occasionally oneshot someone.
---
Does the fact that i specifically mention 1-299 mean nothing to you?
---
Crendor for sure! really genuine guy without an ego, gets immersed in the game and is always just pleasant to watch
---
Imagine thinking they speak french in Luxemburg
---
**Questing**
---
After 60 any quest you complete has the xp you would have received turned into bonus money instead.
---
**Grinding**
---
Killing mobs drops money and items. Some items are vendor trash, some items are AH sales.
---
Some items are worth more as their Disenchant components than people will pay for the item. Later one other enchanters will buy these items disenchant them and then resale.
---
**Gather Materials.**
---
If you have a spec that can gather cloth, leather, herbs, or Ores.  You can sell those either to vendors or Auction house depending on the market, Enchanting is on this list because you can also farm "magical" items to disenchant and then sell the materials.
---
**Crafting Professions.**
---
Enchanting, Alchemy, Blacksmithing, Leatherworking all have certain recipes that are not BoP that sell for decent amounts, You'll have to pay attention to the price of the materials versus the price of the finished goods, sometimes it's more profitable to sell the raw material rather than the finished goods.
---
Alchemy in particular has a transmute skill that can only be used ounce per two days, people will pay to use that skill.
---
Engineering has a couple recipes (like scopes and ammo) that can be sold, however the majority of their products requires engineering to use, so it really reduces the customer base to only people that have the skill, have lots of gold and little time.
---
**Class skills.**
---
Mages can summon portals, food and water,  People pay for these.
---
Rogues can open locked boxes for people.
---
Neither of these make excellent gold per hour but when combined with service professions like enchanting, where your are stuck in town anyway selling your wares, they can offer some additonal income oppurtunties.
---
**Arbitrage**
---
Once you have some money, you can engage in Arbitrage in the Auction House.  Buying under priced Items and either holding them until the price goes up, or relisting for the "correct" price.  With non-linked auction houses it's not entirely difficult for 1 character to completely take over a single market for a time. (e.g. buy all silk and list for higher price.)  Some people also play the "minimum bid game", where they seek out tiems with very low minimum bids, and high buy outs, in hopes that no one is willing to wait on the auction to end, then relist the price with more reasonable prices.
---
**Rare Recipes**
---
Travel the world for Rare, and limited supply recipes. Some people can't be bother to look them up and will pay a premium to just instantly buy them out on the aunction house.  Most people just have a route they travel and pick up "known sellers", and for really  hard to get recipes, they will level an alt out at the merchant, and just log back in every now and then to buy out the supply again.
---
**Dungeon Runs**
---
After your high level, there are many alts who will gladly pay for someone to just run them through a dungeon.  They won't get great XP but they will get all the quest rewards very fast.
---
Certain dungeons and Raids require keys or other items to open the doors or trigger optional bosses, or skip content.  Leaving a character logged out at the entrance means you can collect a tidy sum just to open a door for the raid.
---
Lay down  -&gt; Cry - &gt; Hope they spare you -&gt; Hope they have bigger fish to fry when you res -&gt; Despair when realizing STV is ground hog day but with ganking -&gt; Return the favor when higher level
---
I'd double down on that shit and take off my pants!
---
MrGM is good. He’s UK based though so if you’re in America he only streams from around 8am-1pm EST
---
Same boat pal, I was a NE warrior and my level 25 friend took me across the sea and ran me from menethil to IF. I'm glad he did because I enjoyed leveling in Westfall and darkshire.
---
And already a reposted meme.
---
Omar summoned you, pitiful mortal
---
Especially since Mortal Strike takes up a debuff slot.
---
Stacks of Runecloth.    
---
There was a video yesterday complaining that healers had no way to make bank in classic (due to bad solo DPS). But having a solid group and doing 45 minute Strat runs was stacks and stacks of juicy runecloth. You'd also get some blues/greens, and a chance on the mount. By the end our "45 minute" runs were closer to 30 minute runs, and it wasn't only gear, just learning the pulls/timing and often pulling before the last mob died or dragging mobs into the event gates.   
---
That's how I made most of my money in classic.
---
I doubt people who played through vanilla at the time will have the patience to play 2-3 years with nothing new.
---
But the tanks doing less threat due to higher parry will hurt  a fury warrior more than a rogue because rogue doesn't have threat issues like a fury.
---
Same for me, but i just wanted to warn you :P
---
Well, how about you design a bunch of rules surrounding what you think classic hardcore mode should be... make a video.... post video... and on classic release make a series about your hardcore character!!! 
---
I'll take my royalties when you become rich off YouTube monies.
---
Not really, dungeons and raids are a much more social experience to me when I think back on Vanilla. You needed to find people, organise and go to the locations, sure the content wasn't super challenging, but it required co-ordination to achieve. Now you click a button, teleport, leave. I don't think I even speak to people unless they mess something up when I last played WoW.
---
You can filter anything you want with RES dude. Get over yourself. Just filter out the word streamer.
---
a quick test on level 2 boars during the frist stress test to take a look at "bonus exp" and group exp:  
---
level 2 boar   
---
52 exp (1player)   
---
29+3 exp (2players)   
---
21+4 exp (3 players)   
---
17+4 (4 PLAYERS)
---
I always wanted to collect the rare bs patterns ; it’s always been a dream that I would play a NE warrior and have the rarest of rare bs patterns in the game. Just personal preference more than anything.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7--FKSEXkFw
---
Ty for that. I have never been one to watch the cinematic. I was always in a rush. This time I am going to take it slow.
---
holy priest is not that bad for leveling if you take wand spec and spirit  tap
---
2 things weird here, 1.hunters mark animation is wrong and 2. It should not be removed when the hunter dies. Can you please report that
---
I think a paladin will work perfectly with a warlock. 
---
- Both have similar movement speeds, both get mounts at 40 for free which is great as you wont have to worry about saving/sharing gold for one of you to get the mount.
---
- You won't be competing for gear as you will be mail/plate and she cloth which is also nice.
---
- Great utility as a paladin and it could be fun to do big DoT pulls with the warlock and support with blessing of protection and heals. 
---
- This also allows you to get into groups easier as you can heal/tank. And getting healing gear will be easier as you can take the non-upgrades your wife doesn't need.
---
-The cons of a paladin being slow levelers and having no rotation are erased when leveling with another person! 
---
Me as a dwarf paladin and my friend as a warlock is the dream.
---
Also you do not necessarily need to play a human! If you make a night elf for example, you could do the dreaded run to the human starting area and start from the beginning with your wife... That is ofcourse if your wife doesn't mind being an interracial couple ;)
---
Good luck on your choice, but I think this would be a great option considering paladin was one of your first choices anyway!
---
They are the minority.
---
Lol - if it works out like that, then I'll be happy to have failed
---
So when you post your images directly in a thread like this, did you just include an "[img]" tag around them? I'd like to share my beta experience as you have done here
---
Is this it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7--FKSEXkFw ?
---
Does it not take priority over damaging spells if it's in the same batch?
---
They will just release TBC and Wrath servers.  The idea that they will make novel content is analogous to Diablo fans sure they would announce Diablo 4 last year.
---
But we are not provided the correct numbers, because the DPS meters are not done properly, and neither are the private server logs are correct. That is why math is wrong in this case, because we don't have the proper numbers. However, math is correct if we take the total damage dealt, take the actual length of the fight, and make the math ourselves.
---
&gt; the fact that most Classes only have 1 spec which is decent or considered viable
---
but this isn't true in vanilla
---
But...Esfand is the real player the rest of us are just stream NPCs.   :)
---
The matrix has us!
---
They did this quite well in vanilla itself.
---
For example titanic leggings are very good, but also cost 800-1000g. So you have means to get on a good standing without having to raid for a year.
---
Just farm for a while - less optimal than decked out chars obviously - and you can get into the big boy ballpark.
---
That's how I geared my last pserver char that I leveled when AQ40 came out.
---
 [https://legacyplayers.com/Armory/?charid=350780](https://legacyplayers.com/Armory/?charid=350780)
---
Nothing says community like attempting to segregate those who are less knowledgeable.
---
then play holy priest or tank warrior :D
---
Increasing the level cap neccissarily fucks with the talent tree. The talent tree already barely functions as intended at 60, and stretching it has never worked well. Any increase of the level cap would demand major talent tree reworks.
---
Yeah his story makes no sense. He would have been in loch modan so he would have been sent to the lock modan graveyard in the  updated cataclysm zone.
---
Lol I don’t watch streamers on a regular so any drama involving them I’m completely out of the loop. Esfand is nice though.
---
Blizz didn't say that anyway. One blue posted that on the EU boards then clarified he meant 1% of raiders cleared Naxx pre TBC.
---
holy shit, you managed to make a video so shitty i'd believe this was from original vanilla, well done
---
Apparently not looking at the downvotes :(
---
Kael'thas should have been the blood elf faction leader.
---
He'd be so much more dynamic and interesting than lore'thamar and we'd actually have a horde counter to Jaina's OP magic.
---
As opposed to our current Horde leader situation where everyone but Sylvannas is some form of Warrior.
---
I also find this hilarious. He’s literally asking “how much does int help with gaining weapon skill?” And people are just saying “every bit helps bro.”
---
Having less buttons also makes every action you take worth a lot more, which is part of the appeal. But vanilla goes too far in this direction, which makes the gameplay boring after a while.
---
TBC hits this sweet spot a lot more, just complex enough, while maintaining rotations simple. Class/Combat wise I actually think WotLK is the best expansion, but WotLK ruins a bunch of other things that makes it inferior to tbc in many other aspects.
---
Tbc sucked balls, badge gear, afk battlegrounds to get full epic arena gear, win 10 games each week in arena for free current content epic weapons/armor etc. Raid gear being shit in pvp except for weapons and trinkets, boring zones except nagrand, resto druids pillar humping in bearform with op dot heals, stormherald warriors with mace specc chain stunning from 100-0 etc. And flying but I dont care about flying. 
---
Can go on but you get the point, I believe alot of people would quit tbc and go back to vanilla and ask for more vanilla content.
---
FRICK
---
1. LFR
---
2. Warfronts
---
3. Island Expeditions
---
I can agree with dungeon design from TBC on a mechanical level but those dungeons really were lacking a lot compared to Vanilla. Pretty much every TBC dungeon is a single corridor you follow until the end. Maybe with one split path for a boss. 
---
TBC laid the ground work for what we have today, it was a great game but I'd hope if they do add more content that they're very careful when it comes to copying from tbc
---
I watch soda everyday. I literally can't think of what you're talking about. And even so, are you looking for a silent streamer? Im ultimately confused about what you're looking for. Just find a small streamer who has no energy or personality I guess?
---
that doesn't seem correct, I get 120ping to most east coast servers from Brisbane
---
And every player could use duping when that was possible in several Blizzard games. And people can technically also jump on-top of a roof and avoid guards hitting them in the world, yet I know for a fact that was a bannable offense. Availability of an exploit is not the deciding factor of whether or not something is a cheat.
---
Nah I was in barrens chat on release and the Thunderfury thing didn't start till either TBC or when TBC was about to release.
---
Barrens chat on release was all about Vin Diesel.  (It quickly changed to Chuck Norris)
---
... depends what you are looking for man. if you are looking for someone with insane skills, there are several method members streaming, venruki comes to mind.
---
however if you are looking for entertainers, i would say reconsider what you truly what because those guys you hated on are what entertainers are all about. its not gna get any better. to each his own. anw check Venruki from the guild method. hes streaming quite often and hes insanely good.
---
I was thinking this exact thing a little while back. So glad I won't have to deal with that.
---
Wait until you see old Thousand Needles, Ashenvale/Darkshore, Azshara (even though it was a useless zone outside of farming, it was quite beautiful), the Plaguelands (drearier probably, but man those zones always had....'a feeling' about them), and probably a bunch of other ones im forgetting.  There were a lot of zones im looking forward to seeing simply for the nostalgia, too.  Westfall before the tornadoes, STV as one giant zone, Stonetalon (i think?) is quite a bit different...
---
I'm more impressed with how the game isn't lagging like crazy, used to be people rubberbanding all over the place. Has it been running this smooth consistently?
---
I fondly remember Kara and the rest of the raids to get your first epic gear in TBC. Tanking Kara was so much fun :)
---
The first spot I checked when looking for a Horde FC was a spot they'd jump into behind a big saw near their GY side. It was very prevalent back then, and very annoying.
---
Typically not when it's over 3/4 approval
---
Here is a list of good players that I know is currently streaming classic wow beta. All the dudes listed are very good, and I tried to put at least one person for each class on each faction that I've encountered at a high level that streams.
---
Alliance;
---
* Warrior: Monkeynews (Moo_uk), Helvete (helvetetv), Tribe (Tribe_tv1)
---
* Mage: Kraun (Kraunx)
---
* Rogue: Perplexity (perplexitycya), Xani (xani_us)
---
* Druid: 
---
* Paladin: Esfand (esfandtv)
---
* Warlock: Staysafe (staysafetv)
---
* Priest: Hydra (Hydramist), Ssqrush (ssqrush)
---
* Hunter:
---
Horde;
---
* Warrior: Sonydigital (Sonii)
---
* Mage: Ziqo (ziqoftw), Venruki (venruki), Steezy (steezyswag)

---
* Priest: 
---

---
So are orcs though.... tauren and undead are a little more unique.
---
goes without saying
---
yea this list sums it well. i would add Nixxiom too in special mentions
---
They removed buffs!
---
Retail sounds like a completely different game than TBC
---
Schools are really just gulags
---
I am a little confused by this arguement, the broken were literally in the game at the very start of World of Warcraft Classic in the Swamp of Sorrows, with a story in place for how they got there. So I am not sure that saying they would have had to create some huge story-line to explain why the dranei were here is very valid. Since ya know, they did actually do it...?
---
I'm in the beta on Alliance in Make Azeroth Great Again.  (guild run by Asmongold, Esfand, Swifty, Mcconnell, etc)  Our Guild message of the day, when you log in is, "Give Esfand all of your runecloth"   I dont obviously. Fuck that.  The streamers are carried hard.
---
Post the tooltips and post the damage numbers you are seeing as well as the weapon speed.
---
wait really ? no way he did 100 in a row
---
You can equip the bloodvine set but only benefit from the set bonus if you have 300 tailoring.
---
&gt; Is it worth it for a human to quest there in addition to Westfall?
---
Yes it's worth it, and I'll tell you why: Goats &gt; Horses.
---
im not sure about that
---
I am with you. The wotlk combat was the best. We will see maybe they balance the specs without leaving the classic fields
---
No.... you don't mess with the TBC Kara.
---
By all means, don't take good advice.  I'd rather competition be lower when I try to reach Rank 14.
---
*Yikes.*
---
MCCOOL
---
Only in very hardcore guilds, or wannabe hardcore guilds that care too much about the little things but aren't actually good. 
---
Race differences are pretty minor, unlike subpar specs. A few % difference vs. 50%. Most guilds won't care.
---
You realize people were dicks and elitist throughout Vanilla?  They just talked more than anyone does now in video games, because there was no other way.
---
I'm hoping that they had BC but have it as a separate product, let us mirror over our classic characters and be able to play both.
---
Denied.
---
(THEY’RE DENIED)
---
This isn't a matter of opinion mr rational centrist, you are just wrong
---
That's a waste of development time. After you get max...no one cares about leveling, it's just something you have to do.
---
It was server dependent.  Will be again.
---
That's what I like about him.
---
Dad rants!
---
For me, because I’ve always wanted to try the TBC iteration of Druids
---
Yes we need to be active and make sure Blizzard knows what and how much we enjoy it. I'll see you there mate!
---
Like I said, cleared things up.  Have a good day!
---
This x2. Anytime someone posts about how they hope streamers don’t ruin the game I keep thinking I wonder how they are going to make it anywhere with my camping their bodies lol
---
Not a great pentagram, but not a bad starfleet logo. Beam me up!
---
Just do TBC. They have the numbers on how TBC performed back in the day....DO IT!
---
You only need lvl 5 enchant to be able to DE every item I believe.
---
Happened same for me I reported it in the actual beta. Interestingly, the rank 2 dmg starts to scale with you as you get levels and the tooltip changes and eventually nearly double rank 1. Not sure it’s intended , but that’s how it’s working.
---
i stopped reading when i say "i play horde on the beta" god damn you i wanna get into beta :(
---
I wanna be warrior.
---
But should I be a cow, or a green-skin?
---
Of course you can always get geared. There will be new guilds starting new runs every lockout. Not everyone will be raiding every single lockout and not everyone will be starting right away.
---
Some people will take months to get 60.
---
Others will want to raid MC etc on their alts or their B team as well.
---
Using your logic unless you played directly at launch and didn't miss a raid lockout then no one would raid with you and there's no point in playing at all, which just isn't true.
---
People are always looking for tanks.
---
Anecdotal, but I didnt experience that. I felt like i leveled faster begin able to constantly engage targets +multiple targets easier than regular dps... but that's just my experience.
---
Superman and Chuck Norris once got in a fight. Loser had to wear their underwear outside of their pants forever.
---
Depends on your connection I imagine, I usually get 250-350 to NA servers depending on where the realm is physically located
---
They basically have to. There will be a huge amount of people that try Classic when it releases. A majority of those people will ding a few levels and then just go back to BfA.
---
So either you have a few servers and deal with huge log in queues waiting to get in for the first few weeks after launch, or you have a bunch of servers that then become ghost town when the tourists leave.
---
Layering lets you have the ability to get in while the launch rush is on, and then have a good population after that initial wave dies off.
---
I'm not a huge fan of layering either, but it seems to be an ok compromise to deal with the issues. That of course is if blizzard sticks to their word that layering would only be on for the first few weeks, and definitely be turned off by phase 2 at the latest.
---
Wait so this happens to more than just my server?
---
TiL. Damn
---
Priest: Kala
---
People shouldn't need to download external tools to address this.
---
I know how to filter with the flair system. It's the baseline system Reddit provides specifically for this functionality. Why would I want to download a tool to preform a funtion already built into the website. 
---
Mods just need to make a flair system for the sub. It would go a long way for not just this but being able to organize content in the sub better overall.
---
&gt; Get over yourself.
---
What does that even mean?
---
How about those forsen boi's?
---
Trolls regen 5HP/second and there's nothing the raid boss can do about it.
---
depression for alli on pvp servers rly, opps I right clicked this big ass kodo instead of the fp, now 3 guards are killing me.. ok dead.
---
1. Vanilla addons and macros
---
2. Patch progressive talents
---
3. Not giving out the Naxx PvP gear before even BWL is out.
---
This. They could have given you nothing at all - be happy they gave what they could.
---
Had to scroll too far to find a dissenting opinion on this. I think it's a neat idea but one that can't be trusted. All this talk is the same talk that led Blizzard down the path to where they are now. Some people want this some people want that.
---
Vanilla has it's own set of problems within it's own patches. Biggest example for me is the honor system - and then dishonorable kills. And then they introduced battlegrounds which took everyone out of the world for pvp. And then while you still had to travel through the world to reach any battleground location, they cut that and made Battle Masters in the capitol cities so people no longer had to leave the Org/IF and just sit there and queue as if it's a dungeon finder. Another one is ZG/AQ/Naxx was the introduction of loot tokens. No more having to shard a paladin shoulder piece because everyone has it(or even before that getting shaman tier pieces as alliance &amp; vice versa). Instead it's a generic shoulder piece for 3 different potential classes. Is this okay? Good or bad? Nobody likes to get fucked on loot but getting fucked is part of classic. They've confirmed cross-realm BGs for classic because, while I think everyone is pretty against it, it was technically part of Vanilla.
---
Who cares about debating the merits of what can potentially be brought in from other expansions when we have content from Vanilla wow itself that doesn't necessarily conform to the essence of classic. 1.12.1 is the compromise.
---
The mods shouldn’t have to change auto mod just to appease you. You’re the one with the problem so you should find the solution.
---
lol okay bud. Rank 14 is about having no life not having a point in Anger Management.
---
&gt;Wheres the fun 
---
Winning is fun.
---
His last tweet was on 20 November 2018, hes having problems with his shoulders, neck and back since surgery (due to calcium ilness regarding his parathyroids) and trying to get better so he might stream classic i guess?
---
The first raiding guild I was in was called "Lazy Eigths", which was an inside joke that the guild founders had when someone they knew called infinity symbol ( ∞ ) a "Lazy Eight". 
---
Anyway, after downed Hakkar for the first time the guild leader wanted to take a screen shot of us making the infinity symbol in front of Hakkar's corpse. Thing was for some reason this was hard for some people for some reason and there was always at least 3-5 people (in a 20 person raid) out of place. 
---
I've only heard our guild leader rage a few times, and this was one of them. "HOW HARD IS IT TO MAKE A FUCKING 8, GET IN LINE. ZOOM OUT." 
---
We tried it one more time the first time we downed Onyxia and then gave up....
---
No one ever complained about only being able to fly in outlands....its when they introduced flying everywhere that made it dumb.
---
Dungeon farming can be done just as well with a few friends though.
---
Wow devs listen to this man
---
Slightly off topic, but if twitch chat could be distilled into a wow character or a handful, what would it be like and would anyone survive?
---
I'm not talking about average twitch chat, I mean like asmongold twitch chat.
---
I leveled far faster on my Vanilla Paladin vs my Vanilla Warrior. FAR faster.
---
I do it erry time
---
I respectfully disagree.
---
Everyone rips on dailies (chores) today. That started in TBC.
---
Raids don't feel epic anymore. Why? Because there are different difficulty levels. When everyone sees the content, there isn't the same accomplishment. You have already seen that boss model's death animation on easy a half dozen times or more before you beat it on the harder difficulty. In vanilla, it was a big deal when we killed c'thun. It meant something.
---
Badges... Everyone gets them. Everyone gets loot steady. Loot means less when you know it is a guarantee. When you clear something for 4 months and finally get your drop, it means something. In vanilla, purples meant something. Most people were in blues most of vanilla. In TBC, everyone had purples. Everyone. If everyone has the same color, it doesn't mean anything. It may as well not exist and just put item level on gear which was the natural progression they did when color didn't mean anything and look where that went. Loot was an inevitability.
---
Vanilla had fun flavorful items. There were different kinds of weapons. TBC began to take the guess work out.
---
Vanilla took every class and removed weaknesses. Weaknesses define classes. Additionally, leveling for the first time became a joke.
---
They shrank the world from 40 relevant zones to 7 with flying. Faction rivalry? Dead. You no longer see opposing faction except when you're in town. In arenas, now you start fighting alliance. It was so weird back then fighting same faction. It isn't now, but that is because there is no faction rivalry so we don't care. It died in TBC. In vanilla, we hated each other. I loved that.
---
I could go on and on, but TBC started the lazy "let's just design instances and a new island to put them on." What they needed to do is add content into an already vibrant world. It is World of Warcraft not Instances of Warcraft.
---
Good healers are always pre-casting big heals on tanks, so it really isn't an issue.
---
Of course, it will make it harder, but it's still doable. It will affect casual guilds more than hardcore guilds.
---
It is much more true for Vanilla than most if not any other expansion.
---
Enhance, Elemental, Retribution, Protection, Balance, Demonology, Affliction, Arms, Assassination, Sublety, Arcane, Survival (Unless you go ultra endgame and stack Agility). Honorable mention would be Restu druids clearly being subpar, compared to other healing classes, to the point where you mostly only bring 1 or 2. Meanwhile you're stacking priests and paladins, usually.
---
I would say that is a huge amount of of specs considered subpar and some even not viable, in PvE. Now look at TBC, and watch how about any spec can do within a certain threshold of even the best specs, to the point where they're all acceptable.
---
Esfand, the guy who streams/plays with Asmon is generally a really chill guy. He’s also super knowledgeable about the game. 
---
Asmon has already been talked about by you
---
Soda is cringe in the best definition of the word. It makes me sad XQC is friends with him because I cannot stand Soda. 
---
Staysafe is great
---
Snutz is pretty chill but smaller in views
---
Bajheera is also chill 99% of the time
---
Timthetatman is a great streamer when he isn’t around the Fortnite group of streamers. Once he got around them his popularity rose hella fast but he’s just not what I enjoyed watching him for anymore.
---
I haven’t wondered into other streams yet though so I’d give differing streams 5-10 minutes of view time to see if they are enjoyable to watch
---
good lord u are retarded lmfao
---
Preach, brotha!!!
---
It wasn't uncommon for them to start attacking you because they didn't notice the buff and thought the MC was a sign of aggression.
---
Since Kungen said he's gonna come back, I would argue that Kungen is definitely gonna make a huge impact on people chosing their server.
---
Why would you need a macro when you can just right click once?
---
Just stay away from fucking Asmongolds server and you will be allright.
---
You clearly were on a dead server.
---
The combat on a warrior is like playing a rushdown character in a fighting game. You want to get on your target and make it so they cannot get away. It's not just auto attack and hamstrings. You have 3 different stances that determine what abilities are usable at any given time. You can become immune to fear, disarm your opponents, reduce their armor (sunder is actually useful in pvp against plate wearers,) reduce their movement and attack speed, and more. Bad warriors just know how to charge/intercept/hamstring/MS/Bloodthirst. Good warriors know what stance to be in for a given situation, when to use defensive / debuff type abilities, and when to pour on the damage with rushdown tactics. If this sounds like your thing, give it a shot.
---
What the fudge
---
alright what does a multiple r13-14 horde ranker know. reddit has spoken xd
---
MethodJosh.
---
Did I say change automod? 
---
I said add a flair system to the sub so content can be organized and filtered by all users based on what content they want to view.
---
McConnell is a fucking douche bag lol
---
So by the time you could even consider yourself holy (as in having more points in holy than the other specs) you would be 26 already. Sure its not that bad with those points, but those are points you would take anyway leveling as shadow, and all other points padt that would be more useful in shadow than in holy for leveling
---
oh man, that is great.
---
Flair implies automod. How do you think flair gets added?
---
Mad Season, his YouTube videos are great as well, and the host of Classic Wow podcast has been streaming and he is good to watch as well.
---
OSRS have done this exceptionally well. I wish they follow suit.
---
For us that has been playing Pservers all this time, we know we want this! Such a stupid shitty remark from him
---
One of my favorite things to do is when questing is pop off a heal on a warrior who is clearly on the losing end of the fight with a mob and about to die.  It only takes me a couple seconds and saves them a 5 minute corpse run and having to eat and wait for hp.  It's kinda like a reverse gank.
---
Yeah, it will be definitely harder for casual guilds.
---
However, casual guilds can just use protection tanks with more tank gear. And the buff isn't that colossal.
---
I did the 'sub for a year and get Diablo 3 standard edition free' deal. I'd probably do something like that again for an equivalent offering, but not for beta access.
---
After playing the stress test i decided to make a Dwarf Mage last night and level it without any heirlooms, help from my main, etc.
---
I turned off the quest tracking on the map and the objectives tracking on the minimap (unfortunately it still shows some things, but i try to ignore it as best i can...and you still have to get relatively close).  Im only using a few addons that are for UI improvements (SUF, Quartz, Bartender, Bagnon, etc).  Nothing for questing, travel, etc.
---
Im not using the BoA mount you can use from level 1.  Im debating on if im even going to use the brewfest ram once i get riding...but i wont be using other 'fancy' mounts.
---
So far its been quite a bit of fun, but even with cross-realm its downright sad to see how empty some zones are.  Dun Morgoh was a bit more populated than i expected (and i even grouped with a guy that said he was new.  Had very few achievements, though the ones he had were from a bit over a year ago, so idk), but IF still felt pretty dead compared even to when i started in Wrath.  The area between the bank and AH used to be quite busy, even on my medium pop realm :/
---
Users add flair to their posts?
---
Plenty of people complained about flying in TBC, I went from riding my mount and seeing players everywhere to flying to dungeons and seeing barely anyone. It also damaged world pvp as people just ran away.
---
Yeah lol
---
Yeah I don't think flying killed that....LFG was what killed player interaction. Not having to search chat for a group and run there. Summoning stone faction pvp was the best.
---
I didn't mean I hate soda by the way, I actually love watching him. I was just giving reason to OP even though it's stupid.
---
If they're too expensive, people can't buy them. But hopefully some will let their time and loss of levelling sacrifice for the greater good.
---
That's magnificent! All hail Omar
---
Also you could link spells in TBC.
---
If you‘d take „Fire Wand“ and „Shadow Wand“ in consideration aswell, you‘d probably able to buy them from the AH for relatively short money...
---
That‘s my experience from the current beta.
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/SmallAdorableMoonFloof
---
yah, apart from stress test, all other gaming has completely stopped for me...
---
I'm watching so many you tube wow classic videos..
---
We shall see.
---
Down to huge spell batches and massive leeway, it's actually cancer!
---
That's my worry too; but I'm just going to try and be consistent and dedicated and hope that I get into a nice guild from the start!
---
I haven’t caught a lot of Defcamp and Melderon streams, but their videos are solid and I greatly respect that they are using their Beta invites to actually TEST things.
---
Yeah, pretty sure I had the libram enchant to my helm at one point, but changed it when the new enchants came out in TBC.
---
I don't know, seems like a pompous asshole to me. The whole "you streamsniped me" thing with sonydigital soured esfand for me
---
I'm like 99% sure you couldn't before the wotlk pre-patch
---
yeah in reality the leveling spec is more hybrid, ill actually be lvl 28 before I put my first point in holy lol
---
Chuck norris doesn't do push ups he pushes the earth down
---
Sword spec is the best for PvP. It grants you an extra attack, which is basically the same value as a crit, but an extra attack can also be a crit itself, making it more valuable.
---
That applies for both horde and alliance, since weapon skill doesn't affect much in PvP.
---
You'll need to be saving money for your lvl 40 mount... skills cost a lot over time to learn compared to what you get passively... especially if you're wanting to hit lvl cap asap you wont spend time lvling professions (a big slow down effect when you look st the total time from 1-60).
---
This all means that if it is even moderately expensive you'll have to choose between delaying your mount and getting the wand 🤷‍♂️
---
I wasn’t a fan of the panda race and I feel a big portion of the community saw them as a joke race in wow
---
And if they don’t? Then you still see it.
---
Unless mods make automod require flair or automatically flair based on content or manually flair it themselves. 
---
I have never flaired my own post on reddit and I’ve been here for like 8 years.
---
Lmao took my a while to spot the NE. It was like finding Waldo!
---
I don't know if it has to be an actual "streamer" you're looking for, but if you can tolerate YouTube videos, I'd check out SoupaSoka (I already mentioned once I believe) and Joe's Super Fantabulous PC Gaming Channel.
---
Both very chill and seemingly nice, without an ounce of the abnoxious personality seen in other streamers or content creators.
---
Really depends on how much crit you have, right?  The more crit you have without axe spec, the less axe spec will do for you in general.
---
WoW 2 is the best but the risks currently are just too much.
---
The mmo market is fairly weak at the moment despite the popularity of wow and others.
---
would you actually spec imp slam or just find a slow enough weapon to minimize the swing delay?
---
Well, for me, and MANY others, keeping up Classic servers forever, it's the dumbest idea ever. What the hell me, and other, will do in 2024, for example? Play Classic on a server that have 200 people? I mean, seriously.
---
I have been playing WoW since 2005. That is 13 fucking years. And A LOT of people played WoW for 10+ years, so it's no wonder that I, and many others, have a BIG QUESTION : what am I going to play in 5 years from now? BfA 3.0 ? No thanks. Classic? Play Classic or FIVE fucking years? Sure, on private servers it's ACCEPTABLE, because they DO NOT have the means to DEVELOP IT.
---
But Blizzard? They surely fucking CAN, because this is what they do : DEVELOP games. And I want to know (not now, but about 1 year into Classic) what I am PAYING FOR : a game that will NEVER be developed or a game that it will?
---
Because once I have 2 years of Classic (after 3 more of private servers) I am DONE with it.
---
TBC will absolutely kill Classic, if Classic is not going 1.13. Simply because people who don't want to play TBC (and there is about half of Classic player base) will quit Classic. There is massive difference between rerolling pserver after pserver, FOR FREE, and paying Blizzard for Classic.
---
Most people (I would say over 90%) want either TBC, either 1.13. Very few want permanent Classic. Those people are simply out of touch. They think that playing Classic forever is somehow reliable. Yeah, it is...if you do it FOR FREE and because there is no alternative.
---
But when there is an alternative, and you PAY for that...95% of the Classic player base will simply stop paying and playing Classic, if there isn't a continuation, regardless which is. You would be forced to either play TBC, or QUIT. There isn't a THIRD option...unless Blizzard develops 1.13.
---
Without 1.13, TBC will absolutely kill Classic WoW. It's so logical, that I don't see how the hell you can't see it.
---
Been following since I seen this big brain play from Xani vs Stormx
---
Yeah idk I started watching Soda about a week ago (not very long I know) but hes been chill the whole time
---
Venruki and Cdew.
---
Make users flair their posts. It's not hard. Any post that doesn't get flaired in some way gets removed. Make enough different flair types to encompass all content.
---
Prot doesn't farm very fast, but you can easily survive most situations with your high health pool and defense oriented gear. Focus on shields that have high block value and gear that increases your block value so you can get strong shield slams. If you don't have that kind of gear, wear some stam/crit/str gear for boosting dps while farming. You can boost your damage to mobs by equipping damage shield gear like the Nagelring, Drillborer Disk, shield spikes, or go engineering for a force reactive disk (rare pattern, expensive to make and repair because it breaks a lot.) You won't have as good of aoe farming capabilities like a paladin will, but you can hold your own and survive better than most. It might be worthwhile to look into solo farming some mid-40's dungeons for gold as prot since you'll be doing slow single target damage.
---
It what happened to me. How the hell is that "wrong"?
---
&gt; leveling race.
---
what race? this is classic
---
What’s the point of getting new gear if there’s no increase in power.
---
All the people trying to make those wands will fall mikes behind. It’s going to be hard enough getting mobs nevermind farming out the cloth mats. You can get a wand at level 9 in darkshore. Don’t waste time or money on the wand when it won’t be that much faster especially with time invested to get it.
---
I think they know they will have to release arena at some point regardless of what patch it's on. To many people are waiting for this specifically.
---
Play a feral dps druid, you'll be the most unique
---
imo the problem with retail is that everything from 1-119 feels like you're getting boosted, blasting through empty zones in order to catch up with the rest of the world. There's a big separation between the "real game" at 120 and the abandoned cities from prior expansions. 
---
I don't think Classic won't have that problem. We'll still go back to Ironforge after the raid, and a new level 10 will still feel like they are part of the same world as the lvl 60 raiders, even if there is new endgame content.
---
wasn't dual wield also always just a class skill? I don't remember ever going to a weapon trainer to pick up dual wielding.
---
The dps difference isn't that noticeable, but it makes your itemization better. Edgemaster's handguards don't have any stats besides +weapon skill, so being a human/orc allows you to use gloves with actual stats.
---
The dps difference is somewhere from 30 to 50 dps in raid gear and world buffs. This varies depending on your gear and buffs though.
---
That's physically impossible (due to distance), it's typically around 150-180ms RTT to the West coast.  East coast would be a further 50ms or so.
---
Maybe something is telling you the latency (one-way transmit time).
---
Priest - can PVE as holy, disc or shadow and PVP as disc, shadow or disc/holy/shadow. Other classes get two viable raid specs at best.
---
if you're after a warlock streamer, have you tried maldiva?
---
So you’re saying change automod to remove non-flaired posts. 
---
Make ALL POSTS require flair because YOU don’t like hearing about streamers. 
---
How about you download RES so the other 120,000 people on the subreddit don’t have to change because of what you want?
---
 Weird champ, feels weird man, normies omega LOL
---
 I can’t speak for the other races but the gnome racial was beneficial for PvP.
---
horde rogues basically never want maces iirc. Double sword is usually best bc sword spec talent is extremely powerful, but dagger spec is worth dipping into if you stumble upon a massive upgrade.
---
And who will play Classic in 2024, for example?
---
Actually, let me REPHRASE IT :
---
Who the hell will PAY and PLAY Classic in 2024, for example?
---
It didn't happen right away but it was quickly apparent.
---
Everyone having a 3 second I'm invincible to all damage and can go wherever I want killed the experience.
---
In Vanilla you would often have to take res sickness to get away from world PVP.  In TBC all you needed was 3 seconds to get on your flying mount and then you could easily get to a place where you were completely immune from harm.
---
And so could whoever was camping you.
---
Ganking still happened but it never grew to the massive PvP brawls of vanilla because whoever was losing would just fly away.
---
And you sound like the one that wasn't around for TBC this was a huge complaint that was brought up time and time again on the forums.
---
Id take bliz over the players.
---
I like the concept of customizing your gear in other games such as inks, etc. but I don't like that any paladin, for example, just go throw on T2 Judgement.  I think raid gear transmogs should have only been available to those who looted it at the relevant time (kind of like now you can't just throw on Rank 10 gear to xmog unless you got rank 10). But again, I do think the concept of inks, etc is kinda cool and that kind of system would end up still looking less ubiquitous than what we have right now.
---
Seconded. He's very articulate, and pleasant to listen to.
---
It's been this way from the beginning
---
Generally only Humans rode horses so it depends how many Human characters are above level 40 I guess.
---
If you count Warlock mounts as horses too you'll need to factor them in, and sometimes you got non-Humans grinding high enough with Stormwind to get one.
---
To answer your real question: it varied server to server, but from my memory I think you were more likely to have a minor Alliance advantage than you were to have a Horde one. Like 55/45 Alliance/Horde was more common than 45/55.
---
I would love all of this i don't want to just follow the old expacs route.
---
I've been going back and forth between mage, hunter, and rogue and I think you just made it easy for me to choose mage. Thanks!!
---
Chuck Norris was there all those years ago. That faithful 2013 Blizzcon day when Brack told us what we thought and in a truly miraculous display of patience Chuck did not round house kick Brack out of existence; nay instead he went off to find Bracks mother.
---
Upon opening the door Mrs. Brack found her ovaries full of Chuck Norris' signature cowboy boot and as she flew back through a wall Omar himself rocketed out of her womb, clutching a flash drive with the original working 1.12 client.
---
Thats right my brothers, this is the true origin of our Lord and Savior; Omar. With one kick Chuck Norris both impregnated and fully gestated our lord and savior Omar and as he flew out from the womb he rapidly aged and took upon a similar rougged countenance of Robert Downy Jr.
---
Sheep-healing targets is only a tiny part of what they do.
---
There are a billion ways to grief and punish people, especially with cross-faction collusion.
---
You can be absolutely 100% certain that there will be a devilsaur mafia on every major server.
---
Nah, it carries you until the mara quest staff.
---
Many streamers have said they will hide their server name as long as possible. Of course once they are in on launch day people will find out, but at least for character creation it will be a secret.
---
I think the 1% only referred to Naxx
---
Username checks out!
---
No, not really. You saying that 1-299 feels like a money sink (which it is) because of poor leveling gear does *not* explicitly mean you're not also talking about endgame. It'd help if you were clearer about what you meant rather than letting people interpret it and then acting indignant when they call you out on it over and over.
---
Besides which, you're not even right in the first place. I'll just pull a random example but honestly I feel like you could do it for any profession. Bard's Trousers of the Wolf are a level 13 random green leather item with 3 agi, 3 spirit. Light Leather pants (crafted) are one level higher and offer **5** agi and 3 spirit. How is that noticeably worse? And didn't you say they didn't need to be better anyway? Especially when you consider that you have to either get really lucky and have that item drop in the wild, or find the one you need on the AH and pay for it. Crafting is *way* more of a certainty while leveling. The real reason people don't bother is that you just don't need to. You'll come across enough greens while leveling that you don't need to bother blowing materials on upgrades. Crafting is fine.
---
Dude. Vael has that mechanic.
---
It’s not clear but I found this test online.

i definitely meant west coast i am retard
---
Repost? srsly
---
Just curious why you disliked TBC so much. To me, TBC was when Blizzard really hit their stride and the game was all-around more polished and fun.
---
Lol I like this plan
---
Most streamers aren't going to announce to what server they're going to play on and if they do, they're probably lying.
---
For as much as you want to avoid them, they want to avoid trolls.
---
BWL was hard because people had no idea what they were doing.
---
Now that we have addons and websites that will tell us exactly how to dps, generate threat and handle mechanics, BWL will be very easy.
---
Kinda surprised to hear Emerald Nightmare described as one of the most poorly received raids ever. I freaking adored that place, i thought the fights were absolutely brilliant and it was pretty badass to be in the emerald dream finally
---
The point is, people here are having an attitude like "yeah, suck it J! look at how much people are paying classic!!" and seem to forget that this is actually a good thing for him, since lots of people are subbing to play it.
---
If anything, he's really happy to be wrong back then.
---
I mained a raiding prot paladin in vanilla.
---
I will take one TBC, please.
---
I think you are right. WoTLK is definitely when the game start trending towards “everyone gets a trophy”. It had the biggest player base and I’m sure the execs got in there and started forcing decisions. Thanks Activision
---
I think you're timeline is a bit mixed there. WoD was after Cata. But I get you and I can agree. I'd also like a different solution for flying. I don't think it shouldn't exist, it's cool you can fly to some zones. I just don't like how freely you can do it because it just destroys any World PvP and also helps significantly to weaken the community feel in the game. 
---
I think the 40-man raids were cool, but from a balance stand point it makes it so much harder. One thing mostly everyone agrees is that Classic raids were pretty straightforward in terms of mechanics. Can you imagine how fucking insane it'd be to apply some of the raid mechanics we have today to a 40-man raid? It wouldn't be impossible but it would be a lot more frustrating for sure. In that sense, I think 40-man is just too much. I think 25 was a pretty decent compromise. 
---
And there are some very important things that are a lot better in TBC than in Vanilla. The talents were better, a lot more specs were viable. Class desgin overall was also better, we had considerably less 2 button rotations and stuff like that. The game just felt overall much healthier to me except for flying. But my opinion is heavily biased from TBC nostalgia so feel free to counter anything I've said with Vanilla examples, I do have very little experience and knowledge about Vanilla and would like to keep this discussion going!
---
yeah but most of them don't have aids communities
---
Again, +10 int is better than +0. Why does it matter how big the positives are when there are zero negatives
---
The legion re-make was pretty great too. Definitely agree, Karazhan was the peak of WoW raiding
---
\*the shitty part of Belgium is French
---
Whatever, if you think its Bobby Kotick that made the decision to bring back classic then you're an idiot. Maybe you should think about the size of the organisations you are talking about before you go spouting off garbage like you know things, it was either Morhaime or Brack (in his role as VP) that green lit the classic project. 
---
If Brack was truly pushing against Vanilla then Morhaime probable would have trusted his advice - Did Brack know at the time that he would become President the same year that classic would launch, probably not, but its a fun conspiracy. 
---
What isn' isn't a conspiracy theory is the willingness of the people here who despise both Brack and Activision Blizzard and yet are creaming in their pants for the chance to give blizzard nearly 200 dollars a year for the next 2 years for the pleasure of playing classic agian.
---
Preach to the echochamber.
---
Any potential to link that kind of loot guide? Don’t worry I won’t compete with you ;)
---
I made a little mage on retail last night (no BoA gear, quest tracking on the map/minimap turned off, no help from my main, etc).  Ended up looking in my spellbook after a few levels to see when i was going to get arcane intellect to throw on someone.
---
You dont get it until something like level fucking 58.  What the fuck?
---
I have heard a few streamers say they are going PvE as they cant effectively stream with people hunting them down and killing them constantly
---
Curiosity
---
That's because a million specs is poor design, current wow says hi. Everything feels just about the same - homogenization is a huge issue with modem wow.
---
Also when raiding in vanilla, there was no "more specs".  You had a class and a spec for raiding.
---
He's joking
---
He’s really entertaining to watch and listen to about game philosophy, seems super kind-hearted as well.
---
Talking about PVP, i'm wondering what to dow with. Either Shaman or Paladin.
---
Our focus is on bg's (no premade).
---
I feel like shaman lacks dispel of magic. (Yeah crounding, i know). Is that a big problem?
---
Hating on McConnell is such a 2018 meme
---
Hard to have a life when rape gangs patrol your streets.
---
He plays on EU.
---
&gt; Guilds are clearing MC in greens and a couple of blues as soon as they hit 60 and get attuned 
---
On private servers, where Bosses have 5.6% parry, vs Classic 14% parry, lower resistances, bugged paths, endless World Buffs and endless flasks.
---
I am sorry, but outside EXCEPTIONAL guilds (less than 1% of the population) MC will be a struggle for the most players. And BWL a damn graveyard.
---
Not even mentioning AQ40 and Naxx. Most players in Classic will see AQ40 and Naxx from OUTSIDE.
---
He's probably one of the more chill streamers out there. I'm not a huge fan of sellout Sunday just cause it's such a headache to listen to lol.
---
Just go watch Asmongold wipe repeatedly in BWL and you can see that it's not quite *that* easy. If you're a current mythic raider, sure, the raids probably won't be up to that standard. But for the vast majority of players it'll be just as hard as the raids they do now.
---
We'll have to agree to disagree then.
---
Both the original attack and a Sword Spec proc can crit, which is significantly more damage than a single crit. The Sword Spec proc is also always full damage, even from something like Hamstring which still does very little damage when you crit. Sword Spec procs also generate rage. Finally, Sword Spec procs can proc Sword Spec.
---
nobody gives a sweet fuck about retail, on what planet do you think that beta will not and has not already done better than retail wow? LOL
---
Most people here simply don't want their servers to revolve around modern e-celebs.
---
Whether you're worshipping them, or actively putting an effort into griefing them, you're still letting everything be about them.
---
I just want a server with a community that grows naturally, and where I can enter Orgrimmar without seeing "OMEGALUL Asmongold just got BRE PogU EZ Clap POGGERS"
---
Well his main account is EU, so its likely his Classic account will be too.
---
Definitely the best option. As much as I love PvP if I was a big streamer, you'd bet I'd roll PvE to have my peace.
---
Yeah, there was definitely some stuff in TBC that I didn’t like.  Dailies for sure, and even worse for me was flying mounts.  But the improvements to the game far outweigh the negatives at least for me.  
---
Now if I could get TBC without flying mounts, dailies, and catchup mechanics, we’d have close to the perfect version of WoW IMO.
---
Cowboy hat from Gucci?
---
Hey thanks for the suggestion, does Kala stream? What's the stream name and I'll edit the list.
---
Hopefully most US streamers are gonna roll on the same server but yea sucks that classic now got all these streamer fanbase ppl to deal with.
---
Yes, over a decade of requests, Pservers  all over the place, some of which closed because they got a "bit" too popular, clearly indicates a game that will die.
---
All Classic needs is fresh servers every 2-3 years to keep enough players. It will never die. And if you think it will, then please describe "dying". Because it will never ever drop under 50k players and this is pretty big guess on the number. It will probably be higher.
---
If you are too concerned about blizzard making millions, then this has nothing to do with Classic, it doesn't need million players, it needs enough and it will always have them.
---
I'm just saying a shadow or boomkin is more likly to get in a forty man because many groups will be desperate for those last few guys.
---
I do appreciate the streamers that watch their language.  I don’t have virgin ears or anything, but I like to have streams on (or videos) in the background and often I can’t do that with the kids around.
---
I'm so happy these people are going to play anywhere from 5 minutes to a few days, hate it, and fuck off. They're precisely the people that Blizzard are talking about when they talk about tourists leaving the servers and one of the reasons layering has to happen to prevent servers becoming graveyards.
---
For the Horse!
---
They don't know forsenKek
---
They have? Why would they do that?
---
I sure was, Ive been playing games since I was 4. I was garbage at wrath but i was able to play, i had a level 42 hunter
---
a sad imitation of something sodapoppin did like a week ago
---
I was in no way talking about spells. 
---
Does that make sense now?
---
Leveling race refers to quickly getting to 60. Which a lot of people will do, including myself. 
---
I assume you'll be taking your time. Hope you have a blast doing so!
---
Oh really? 2 weeks early we get to create characters I am sure they will stream that.
---
It was buttery smooth on my aw3814dw; on a GeForce 2070 and i5-9600k.
---
They will go super-cheap at launch so don't worry about it.
---
Nobody has any coin at the start, and if someone's trying to sell it for more then 10silver nobody will buy them.
---
Because Classic WoW is not like most games.
---
It's a whole different monster. If other games would be like Classic, all MMOs would have millions of players.
---
But even the most popular ones have under 1 million.
---
So...other games are other games. Classic is different.
---
This is adorable, helpful, and I want to pinch your butt.
---
Or you just leave it as is and instead add something else. If they can't fix it then they at least don't have to fuck it up.
---
... they removed buffs? All buffs?
---
Oh I hope so. If they go PVP and I end up on their server I can def see my guild have a few nights dedicated to ganking streamers and ruining their world boss attempts.
---
I probably worded my question poorly, I’ve edited to reflect what I mean. I wouldn’t do hybrid roles, more-so, swapping between roles depending on who I’m playing with
---
Someone answered it
---
For every person actively avoiding their server, there are 3 that want to play on their server.
---
Brilliant, very helpful cheers pal!
---
There's still Shaman, Priest, and Druid. Depends if you want mobility, raw healing, or utility/burst. Different playstyles for sure.
---
&gt;Layering doesn't work fine
---
I don't believe I said it was working at all, let alone fine. My point was this is a beta, if Blizzard wants layering they still have several weeks to fix it. Your LFG comment is unrelated, and completely moot, because they *aren't* adding LFG. They're adding *layering*.
---
Unreal! Thanks my dude
---
to help the server pops, to prevent hordes of trolls following them and ganking them etc.
---
I was curious so i picked a random video of his and watched, having never even heard of this guy before. 
---
He speaks pretty loud. His base volume for talking about anything is pretty loud and his style of speech is forceful. He was ganked by a guy and was lliterally screaming at the game.
---
The entire time he played shitty whiny metal music.
---
It was not an enjoyable time. 
---
Then again I dont really enjoy streamers in general. The only time I want to watch someone else play a video game is when they are doing something very challenging and impressive. Watching this dude mine iron on a BETA for a re-release of a game from 14 years ago is not my idea of a good time. lol
---
This lines up with my vanilla experience. It seems similar to the rules about leveling fishing in which your chance to skillup is divided by the number of previous skillups somehow. It's heavily biased by your current cap, though: when you level, you routinely get those last 2-3 points were missing from the previous cap on the next mob or two.
---
yeah and no one likes Mike's behind
---
The flair system has more benefits than just being able to filter streamer hate. It helps organize the entire sub better.

Have you even been around lately? You think I'm the only one that's complained  about the constant negative streamer posts? Since the beta has come it it seem half this sub has turned into jealous 7 year olds that now hate all streamers who got beta access and the other half is tired of hearing you all complain.
---
RES does not adequately cover this either. If you just filter 'streamer' then all of it get's filtered. I like seeing clips of what people are doing on the beta. Filtering 'streamer' also doesn't stop threads that is streamer hate directed at a specific person but doesn't include the word 'streamer' in the title. 
---
What exactly is the problem with having a flair system anyway? Do you just get off to broadcasting your thoughts to people that don't want to hear them? Your irrational burning hatred of Asmongold and TipsOut has nothing to do with Classic wow to begin with. 
---
If you want to bitch and complain about it, fine, whatever gets you off. At least give the other people in the sub the ability to focus on posts related to Classic wow rather than the streamer hate circle jerk.

Hahaha I forgot about them beautifully customisable trees, it’s been far too long old friend ❤️ helpful af dude cheers but ya mans no shaman
---
The other replies here are great as well, I would say just push your own advantages as well though.  
---
"Guys I have an extra 1% avoidance so I'm less likely to die!"  But for real since you know you have that extra 1% dodge it can allow you to wear a piece of gear that maybe boosts your DPS (and therefore, TPS) to help you hold threat a bit more.
---
When I eventually got fed up of Vanilla back in the day, it was because I had to spend all my free time farming gold for respec costs.  I loved tanking butg gotta pvp most days too.
---
I need a class I can still raid while in an optimal pvp spec.
---
Thanks; that’s what I think; but you know how everyone is a “pro gamer” nowadays and get on this hype train of meta or bust.

---
Thats what I was hoping but nope Blizz threw that away with TBC. Hell they honestly should have created a third faction that consisted of Blood Elves, Draeni and Naga all under the leadership of Illidan as he fights against the Legion.
---
This guy is correct, middling ping (200-400ms) is very doable in PVE but PVP will be a laugher, people disappearing and reappearing all over the place and good luck getting a pummel/sheild bash off successfully.
---
It’s a great analogy for those born into wealth, but I think most rich people know they got the cheats.
---
they found the old classic code on an 1.12 backup. they said so in their blizzcon classic panel.
---
the nostalrius people were just invited to give their experience on the matter of classic servers and to evaluate the possible consumer reach.
---
they basically held a powerpoint talking about running their server, the problems they were facing and the stats of their users.
---
That's how it is on pservers, but on the classic stress test I was able to learn 2h maces from thunder bluff on my druid when I went there at level 8.
---
Yeah, I consider people who spam it idiots. Always guild kicked people who spammed it. Don't want to be associated with morons. I hated the Feenix servers, but loved the GMs because they banned anyone who posted that in world chat.
---
This is the first actually good and original meme on this sub I’ve seen. The “Flight Master or mailbox” thing is painfully true.

I was trying to make a cynical joke. 
---
I completely see your point, I simply think the general hate in this sub is getting out of control in the recent weeks around streamers.
---
It wouldn't be noticeable if you only needed 5 more skill points after a level up, but if you had to go from 1 to say 200 then you would notice a fairly significant increase in skill ups. Those grinds can take a long time and even just getting a few extra skill ups that you wouldn't have normally had will be helpful. Especially at lvl 60 when you get a weapon type you haven't used(due to almost none existing) like fists or pole-arms that grind can feel like a lifetime.
---
Not at all. But I’ll take space goats along with better class balance and arena, while keeping the vanilla feel any day of the week.

Yeah, but if they go with new classic content in the spirit of vanilla, they scan still incorporate some of the best parts of TBC like the class changes and kara while still keeping it vanilla and avoiding flying and dailies and whatnot.

&gt; Because I absolutely loved TBC and view it as a better game than Vanilla.
---
Class balance? Sure. New continent, flying, and insane power creep? No thank you. Once TBC launched, the level 55-60 content was a waste of time. Level 58 Outlands greens outclassed all pre-raid gear, and a fair number of raid items.

I mostly want to play a priest, but hunter is very close 2nd. I'm good at healing and playing a priest but it is ONLY fun to me in groups. I played on a certain pserver with friends who all planning to do end game stuff with me and I was completely alone by the time I hit level cap and suffered pretty badly out in the open world trying to get anything done.   I will be playing on a PvP server and I have some PTSD about priest that makes me want to almost so "screw it, I can fall back to solo farming on hunter and they are strong in WPvP and solo or group PvP"  But I truly get off on healing my teammates and watching our team win as a result.  Maybe classic will stick for friends this time and I won't have to go at it alone as much, but even guilds get cliques and people have their own agendas.
---
I dunno what to do.  :-/
---
It's not that. It's that even a legit 1.12 server will be easier than actual vanilla was, because it's a snapshot of the easiest version of the game. There was a lot of staple content,like 5-mans, which saw massive nerfs near the end of vanilla to try and help casuals catch up.
---
I am still debating between Rogue/Mage (classes I know) and a Priest (A class I only know what I have researched).
---
Vanilla was easier for me since nobody knew wtf was what or what was good at the time so I went with what I thought looked cool at the time.

Ok so I used server and realm interchangeably but that can be improved. I meant for the sake of the explanation potentially more shards then realms.
---
In terms of server application scaleability I do not know the approach they have taken. But imagine this - you start with 10 powerful physical servers each capable of running 20 shards as virtual servers (requirements of one shard are predictable). You can now run 200 shards. You add one physical server - you can run 20 more shards wherever in-game needed. During an event almost everyone is in one area - so like 100 of your 220 shards are of that area, and maybe even here and there 20 of that particular area are on the same physical server. Event ends - shards go back to be spread across in-game areas, and maybe you can even turn off one server because you only need 200 shards not 220. This is actually pretty common in modern online service development, where physical servers like this can be rented on demand, without human interaction, for short periods of time. Would not be surprised if Blizzard has optimised similarly.

Seems like we have two competing statements. I would say that if he regularly receives gifts like that, regardless of his playtime he's getting a serious leg up on non-streamer players.
---
*note: I don't care about streamers either way and have nothing against soda. I just find it interesting how people who follow streamers will do anything, ANYTHING, for their attention. The magic of celebrity, I guess*
---
I've seen Horde have it several times this week alone.  I know this because I used the rep buff to get Exalted with the Honorbound to unlock my Mag'har Orc race.

Luminarium?
---
yeah idk, it's a different genre so he had different ideas for it I guess. His thoughts/ideas for Wow were always great though
---
Part of me hopes playing on a RP-PvP server (the RP part, specifically) will give me a reason to go to Darnassus more often. I think the music makes it the best place in the game, so maybe some RP narratives will get me there.

Well we have more freedom than you guys, so in the end, we win.
---
Druid is the rarest
---
Haha yeah I understand you. I got the dagger like 1 hour before the server closed, couldn't find a group who made it through rfc. then made 1 pvp match with it... and it was totally worth it haha
---
I'm anticipating at least 3 months for me, maybe even 4. I work odd hours (due to a retail schedule), as well as taking classes in the fall.
---
You can still turn on warmode and get the 10% buff but Alliance are the only ones to get 15% or above because of the faction population disparity.
---
No. And I doubt it would work with Classic since spell selection in macros has been specifically excluded by Blizzard. It was easy enough to do however in vanilla.
---
Mmm. Its a gamble every time since you dont know what your enemy is capable of or what their spec is, what consumes, etc. But typically if you get the jump on them especially if they are unaware of you the better you will be off. So generally yes. Although, avoiding is always an option.
---
My dude, I dig your ideas. Apply for Blizzard please.
---
But what if you like playing Alliance?
---
They’ve specifically named Maraudon to be included in the launch since it was released so quickly after the launch of the original game. Most people weren’t even high enough level to enter by the time it released. So to nearly all of the playerbase at the time, it was as if it always existed.
---
Also world content vs dungeon content are massively different.  If we got by your logic, there were scourge invasions and a bunch of quests in Silithus in 1.12 compared to launch, so those should be there. They won’t be.
---
The phases sort of line up with content patches, so it’s safer to assume things like Gurubashi Arena won’t be included until a later phase, unless specifically named (like Maraudon).
---
All this e-celeb in game obsession could make for an interesting black mirror-Esque premise. I might work on that.
---
different set bonuses, maybe you need certain gear for new content (like gear with resistances on it), sidegrades (better for some specs) or interesting on-hit effects which are useful in PvP... maybe the raid is just really fun or gives some cool cosmetic rewards? There are ways they can extend raiding content without just making the gear strictly better, to a point at least
---
Nope. Weapon Skill grinds to a halt at the top end.
---
Seems like lots of the streamers aren’t going to announce their servers, like classicast and asmongold. Pretty selfish IMO since it’s going to fuck over anyone who doesn’t want to play with them but accidentally rolls on their server, but that’s just how streamers are I guess, always more important.
---
Your so full of shit. You couldn’t alt tab TBC and be successful.
---
Thrall is only warchief because Chuck Norris didn't want the job
---
Jeez stop your whining
---
I was thinking the same thing a week ago but to test if i would have interest in classic i loaded a private server just to see. I have to say that by now i feel more and more sure that classic is just what i wanted
---
That's a good point, wonder why it isn't.

You could have content where its got its own progression system. Like, imagine a bunch of new zones and raids that have a much more fleshed out legendary powerup system that only works in those zones.
---
As a sidebenefit, maybe if you complete all the content you get a modest boost to your character in all zones.
---
&gt;Classic should basically stay as it is forever. That's the idea -- it's a living piece of history.
---
So why did people want Blizzard to bring back the servers for it? Shouldn't they have just played private servers if they wanted literally no changes.
---
Maybe you should uh... go away?
---
Damn, so that Intel buff can save some serious time then.
---
Ohhhhh alright I didn't know that man, thanks for informing me :)

&gt;U mad.

Pretty much confirming you are the child I suspect you to be. 
---
Asmongold and TipsOut are popular targets for the hate. It's not an assumption, it's an example. 
---
&gt; I don’t want a barrier to anyone posting content.
---
It's not content. It also has nothing to do with Classic wow. Flairing posts is not a barrier, it's a means of organizing the subreddit.
---
Chuck Norris is so fast that he can wipe his ass before the turd hits the water

---
Putting more raids in vanilla is the easiest thing ever. As you said, there are  a huge bunch to take from. I'd say scrap BC, and go a new path, more in touch with the original wow.
---
Ah a "You think you do but you don't" fan. Are you also one of those people that says we think we want Classic, but we actually don't? It's all nostalgia and what not?
---
Someone on US WoW forums said something like that :
---
**"TBC was more like an expansion grafted OVER Vanilla, instead of being an expansion OF Vanilla."**
---
That guy is so damn right.
---
&gt; I feel like he really needs a Vampiric Touch in vanilla
---
Maybe they'll eventually update talent trees again or add some spellbooks or something.
---
Classic is wow. And current is not
---
Hes so full of shit, its just hilarious at this point. We've already seen in a couple weeks of beta, just how much private servers got wrong or changed. He advocates for no changes when it suits him. The guy is an absolute idiot.
---
Streaming is just entertainment. If its not your idea of a good time, don't watch. Watch someone play dark souls.
---
Heh, I remember this one. My favorite was someone said "16H a day and this noob is still in lightforge?"
---
This is the dumbest of possible takes.
---
Yeah ofc!
---
Beta is a time to give feedback. They want to add layering, and the community is letting them know it sucks. There's still time for them to reconsider.
---
Judgement of the crusader will never be used in a raid environment due to 16 debuff slots.  Its only used on trash or 20mans.  I dont believe you mentioned farming dark and demonic runes for every raid.  Its a core farm for rets.  Also, are your plans to go ret from day 1?  Most of the bis gear, rets wont receive until 3 or 4 of the top melee have their stuff.  Theres going to be one year plus of rets getting little gear and popping flask of supreme power 2 times a week until aq40.  So ive considered to put in my pally dues early from phase 1, show that im a teamplayer, and then soak up some dps gear when nobody needs it, thrn fully transition to deeps for aq.  Itll be a long grind but im soing it as well.  we gotta give realistic expectations to future new rets.
---
I never experienced the disappearing and reappearing players (unless it was a rogue) in vanilla. I think that would be a poor connection to host more than a 300 ping. Unless I am remembering incorrectly
---
If they ever had to get a real job they’d be in for a shock
---
Thank you for this wonderful advice. You have freed me from a life of unhappily watching streams.
---
&gt;many people still choose to blast through and not explore
---
when the rewards for one pattern of play are so disproportionately greater than another, is it REALLY a choice? Part of the enjoyment of a game (for some people it's the entire point) is to achieve mastery over systems through efficient play. When I am engaging with the game in such a way that I'm being materially rewarded at less than a tenth the rate of someone else playing the same game, there is a strong argument that I am playing the game incorrectly.
---
Meh you know what I played GW2 it was all side grades etc. made me not care about the gear. I play these games to build strong characters.
---
Although this vid does not talk about all the different aspects of the game, it does give a good basic insight in the differences between the two versions.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKCk6ivjWWc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKCk6ivjWWc)
---
I think its too early to speculate. The devs need to see how people interact with classic WoW before they start making new content.
---
On the bright side, we have a few years worth of stuff to release anyway.
---
Wow that wasnt helpfull. Whats the difference i didnt asked you to tell me your opinion about the current one.
---
"they were at least stable in terms of not changing the game for what it was."
---
It's really hard for me to understand the satisfaction of giving away loot to someone you will never have interactions with other than giving said loot in video games.

Salv helps. Horde hardly ever have enough shamans for air totem
---

---
The only huge thing about that, is that it's a huge overstatement. Being a fan of Kungen is so weird though. He's bad at the game, barely remembers anything just like swifty, always acts like he's the correct one due to old prestige etc. Doubt he'll even have above 2k viewers after the few weeks. He'll die down and go away just like every other time he made a "comeback".
---
So the way I'm seeing it is our choice is layering or opening up a ton of extra servers to spread the playerbase thin. After a few weeks when a huuuge chunk of lookyloos slough off and stop playing, we now have a lot of low-pop and even dead servers, with a lot of players who *don't* find small servers quaint and charming, who now need transfers to consolidate the population. This means forced name changes for a lot of players, and nobody wants to lose their name.
---
Alternatively, there's layering. It's not an ideal situation and I'm not sure it's preferable over server merges, especially if they can't get it fixed and working correctly. Assuming it works correctly, it's only around for a few weeks (phase 1 only), a huge chunk of tourists decide the game isn't for them and quit, nobody gets forcibly merged into another community and nobody loses names.
---
Neither is a perfect solution and presents their own issues. I think this boils down to which is the lesser of two evils.
---
Yes this is the big difference in my opinion. Vanilla feels like a whole experience, a whole game, from 1 to 60. You interact with each other no matter the lvl. Be it trade, chat, or hanging around. Fuk flying mounts, they kill off anything social and random encounters of other players. And expansions in far away lands make azeroth way too empty.
---
Yes silithus event and stuff wont be there, but they specifically said so. Idk you could be right, most people seem to think that it'll be there at launch.
---
Hmm. AQ40 is sort of a mixed-tier raid, though. My vanilla guild did the first bosses of AQ40 right outta MC, and was half way through AQ40 before we killed Nefarian. We did the first couple of bosses of Naxx shortly after Nefarian, and we never did clear AQ40 past Twin Emps.
---
I think it would be easy to skip MC (especially if ZG and AQ20 are out). You might be able to skip both MC and BWL by going ZG -&gt; AQ20 -&gt; AQ40. I wouldn't call it mathematically impossible.
---
poggers lul

Man as much as I love vanilla, BC class design was 100x better. Classes were much more fun to play, hybrids were much more viable. If they do keep going with vanilla after naxx, they better update class design cuz the classes at lvl 60 are lacking spells and talents. They become boring as fuck to play real quick compared to BC/wrath classes. Also arenas was the first skill based system with BIS pvp rewards if you were good enough to get the rating. The pvp ranks being time based system flooded with no life premades is a terrible system, I dont want to spend 18 hours a day farming free win BGs with a premade for BIS pvp gear. I was gladiator back in BC and I didn't have to spend 18 hours a day, all you needed to get high rating was to be good at the game, not spend endless amount of time mindlessly grinding bgs against pugs for free wins.
---
I last way longer in PvP anyways.... and I'm terrible at PvP.
---
TMSean is a stream I recommend for calm PG content.
---
I like Kargoz. He primarily streams on YouTube. Hes not pretentious, imo, and really works hard to make great content. He also seems genuinely hyped for the game and not just doing it for the cash monies (even tho it is his primary source of income I believe).
---
IIRC, it was fairly significant because of how low warriors starting int is.
---
https://youtu.be/z0gGWRnoFDI
---
It’s such a different game that a simple reddit response can’t describe it. Classes have their own flavor, everyone can’t do everything. The world is huge and it takes time to get places and gather resources. People have to help each other. Pvp over certain areas means something. I could go on and on and on.
---
I decided to take time off the day AFTER release because I feel the first day will be a shit show and I can always log in after work. By then I should know where they are at I guess.
---
That is obvious. But now we also have to PAY for it, so without something new, Classic servers will be empty deserts in less than 2 years.
---
Blizzard have some time, but not much, before they HAVE to announce that there is a continuation of Classic, otherwise, all the millions of subs they will gain this year, will be gone next year.
---
It's one thing to replay Vanilla, FOR FREE, on private servers...because there isn't anything else.
---
It's a WHOLE other thing to PAY for Classic and replay it. The vast majority of Classic player won't do it.
---
It's just logical.
---
I usually get insulted when I ask for an Int buff as a Warrior...
---
Wow classic is at its core the definition of a mmo to me it has hundreds of unique places to visit, thousands of quests countless creatures and playable races. The quests give you enough freedom to explore the world while giving enough information to get help if needed. The community for the most part is always willing to help either kill a monster help with a quest or simply fuck around.
---
That is a very brief reason as go what classic is to me.
---
One thing I loved in HOTS was fighting powerful figures like Arthas and Varian as Kael Thas without him being the disgraced meme he was in magisters terrace.
---
Another thing everyone is missing about streamer servers is layering.....Blizzard said layers will start to go away as the population gets smaller and smaller. 6 layers to 4 to 2 then to 1 server with the left over population. and all of this is supposed to be done before phase 2. Imagine a streamer server with thousands of more players than any other server. Once they start to get rid of layers are we going to end up with 1 server and 30k people?
---
Private servers had changes and inaccuracies.
---
&gt; Flying mounts are great as long as the surrounding content is designed for them. Adding flying to Kalimdor and EK in Cata is where things really started to fall off.
---
It's like turning on cheats in a single player game. It's really cathartic at first and then you get bored.

---
I think a lot of the smaller ones will but the big guys just cant, all their time would be spent fending off the mob trying to kill them
---
Sorry, Sindragosa.
---
I want arena.
---
Are you going to PAY for Classic for 5 years? Or 10? And replay the same content over and over?
---
Just curious...I want to see how your mind works.
---
If you’re worried about the “leveling race”, you’ll probably spend more time running to a capital AH to buy a wand than just saving the cloth, taking tailoring/enchanting, making the materials to de, then making your wand yourself.
---
The only way a trip to an AH is remotely time saving is if you only do it due to having a number of quests in the capital, which doesn’t normally happen early on.
---
You have to be joking. You actually think most guilds WILL be fucking speed running raids? MOST GUILDS don't even clear the current raid on heroic in retail!
---
Private servers are normally more hardcore players since it's a pain to get setup and into, your average player with everyday access isn't going to be like private server players.
---
MOST classic players will be like MOST retail players, average Joe ape casual players, not people speed running raids as a form of prestige. For the VAST MAJORITY of the players, in game rewards will provide the dopamine hits needed to keep them hooked, not some shitty cosmetics.
---
I do what I must.
---
I just realized how much money Blizzard could make if a streamer decides to server transfer.
---
Jesus, STOP PAYING ATTENTION TO MARK KERN  
---
He is literally a random nobody at this point who failed around accomplishing nothing ever since leaving Blizzard,.
---
Yeah. That’s why I’m kind of tempted to play a NE for the cloaking if enemy players are around.
---
&gt; **they were at least stable in terms of not changing the game for what it was** 
---
Even though we now have definitive proof that private server values have been completely wrong the entire time. 
---
This guy's the laziest troll ever, but people still bite his shit for some reason.
---
Except people have played private servers for ages, with the *same* game. And if they don’t offer an original 1.13 (which is what we get in august) after they change it, then the whole Classic movement is kind of moot. If a lot of the old content gets invalidated, we arent playing the same game.
---
I don’t want you to not get what you want though. Just as I want BC, as well as to keep playing an unbastardized Classic, I realize some want to play a *new* experience. So long as they have the option to still play completely old school Classic, they could add flying and gold tokens to 1.14 and I wouldn’t care.
---
So... is he going to be happily surprised, or horribly disappointed?
---
Great comparison, a different game, with a different player base. Top marks.
---
You attack my chieftain when I am there and you will not succeed again. ;)
---
They make bank now, but yeah,  nothing last forever and all of these streamers are in for a harsh reality when their viewers dry up in their 30s and 40s.

---
Hello all, 
---
For those interested in PvP and understanding the thresholds of warriors, I’d recommend watching Laintime’s video. You will find it pretty easy on a google search and they really showcase the class well. They played on a Korean server and their macros were next level for this time period. They had bindings to swap weapons on stance changes and were quite good at making even the weakness of the class (mobility) seem like a non-issue. Even when some got the jump on them, they could pretty easily turn the tide. I believe the player was rank 14 as well. 
---
I’d also recommend watching HulkSmash’s fury warrior PvP video as the guy just rolled people. He was hitting 3k+ bloodthirst crits in vanilla which was pretty much unheard of. The video is primarily WSG with a pocket healer, that video as well played up the class fantasy of an absolute wrecking ball. 
---
These should give you an idea of the capabilities of the class, but in reality most warriors did come close. The class was Incredibly gear dependent and those looking to emulate them (16yo me) fell a bit flat. Good luck to all of those leveling warrior when classic comes out. That grind can be difficult so definitely pick up cooking and first aid.
---
Can we speak proper english
---
TBC was my favorite. I am glad wow classic came into being so that TBC and WOTLK servers could potentially exist. I am not going to hate on others for disliking one over the other though.
---
This is 100% me. Can't wait to gank Ally scum &lt;3
---
Bosses have higher armour on private servers and take much less damage than on classic servers, so the comparisons balance out. The flasks aren't endless either, flasks are only used for progression, which any Classic raiding guild should be using. MC or BWL won't be a struggle at all. Raids in Vanilla are on par with todays raid finder in terms of mechanics, and the rotations are literally 1-2 buttons for most classes. The only barriers to entry in Vanilla raiding are 1) getting 40 people to show up on time, 2) getting them to farm the required consumables.
---
Following this
---
The race is long, but in the end it’s only with yourself
---
Druid’s are not heal over time class they have two but you will be down ranking healing touch for your main healing.
---
This is a Classic "feature" that was changed at some point later.
---
He's the public fighter for our game, he's been the face of classic wow for many years. Unlike the mainstream ""influencers"", he doesn't take bribes.
---
In EU we kind of watch good series on Netflix hbo etc or eSports. Not some guy screaming at a mic as if he's the kid that never got attention.
---
Stick to private servers then bud
---
I'd be lying if I said buffs didnt influence my class choice. 
---
I almost want to put up with paladin bullshit so I have lots of buffs
---
That would actually be awesome. I never got to see WotLK, so it would be fun to see that content. I bet most newer WoW players haven't seen it, either.
---
Still a better love story than Twilight.
---
&gt; paladins will have a hard time 
---
You're right in that this is absolutely more difficult than warrior or druid tanking, but as long as you stay active then it's definitely possible. I've tanked all the pre-raid content as a protection paladin and it's fine once you get the hang of it, with the exception of Strat and Scholo where you're the god of keeping aggro.
---
Mostly the same game. Current wow has more modern conveniences and playing solo is much more doable. It also looks pretty.
---
Classic encourages group play and has little to no quality of life features. It also has dated graphics.
---
That’s the short version. New people used to new stuff would probably enjoy current wow more. But people who have played a while tend to enjoy the idea of classic.
---
I want arena, but would much rather have it in BC (and much better yet wotlk) than classic. It would be too unbalanced to be enjoyable.
---
Even though the competition for mobs in the stress test was super fierce, I still found myself dropping heals on strangers about to die. The early levels can be brutal, and saving someone can result in them having your back later. Even when we're all competing for the same 6 crag boar ribs, it seems 'worth it' to work together.
---
While waiting for release I've been playing Retail, leveling my old vanilla Priest. In BFA, people move so quickly there's no time to drop a buff, and then with sharding you'll never see them again. What's the point?
---
That said, I have plenty of memories from Vanilla of standing by watching someone die to overpulled quest mobs because they 'stole' a chest spawn from you, or they sniped the mob you were going for. Playing priest I would often fade my mobs over to them if they were trying to snipe them out from under me. "Fine, you want it? Kill it yourself then!" 
---
I expect the honeymoon will end eventually. But who knows, the average player age is going to be much older this time around I reckon.
---
Yea you’ll be fine at that point unless things are REALLY fucked, I want to be one of the first to 60 on my server so I’m kind of obligated to try to get in as soon as I possibly can, it’s pretty awful at first but gets better so much better as you get ahead from what I’ve experienced on pserver launches. The big streamers that’ll really ruin servers will have their server known a few minutes in even if they don’t announce since they’ll have 10k snipers checking every potential realm.
---
Papi  is like the funniest streamer ever.
---
:))
---
I remember so many charge and intercept bugs in vanilla. 
---
I know intercept would calculate based on targets current position but the stun could be resisted meaning if someone was on an epic mount and they were running at a slight angle and resisted the the stun you could end up like 100 yards behind the guy lol. 
---
Charging/intercepting and falling through the ground etc. 
---
I haven’t seen any of those issues on the beta yet.
---
I do agree.  
---
For example why was there not a hard chain quest of betrayal that would open up alliance classes/races to the hord. If they made it so you had to betray your faction then slowly work very hard to be accepted by the hord and vice  versa.  That would have bridges any class/race limits between the factions and allowed you to faction change naturally.   
---
The normal pvp server rules could ofc apply.  Meaning you where not entitled for that quest unless you was the only character on that server.  
---
Sacrifice your character to be come a DK would be fine in my eyes.  Hell even WOTLK talent trees would be fine (as long as your max lv60). It would force you to take more hard decisions and make it more then one cookie cutter build.
---
I haven’t played much of legion or BFA, but my limited understanding is that server doesn’t actually matter in vanilla. All the PvP, world questing, instanced, grouping, and even just casual roaming around is cross server. If everyone plays together, it’s doesn’t really matter which server they are technically on.
---
You've clearly made up your mind already so not much use to have a discussion, I've have already posted more than enough proof that clearly displays leeway just as described. 
---
Here's another clip from vanilla as well: [https://youtu.be/6oiIy5j5oUA?t=370](https://youtu.be/6oiIy5j5oUA?t=370)
---
Fuck this clown.
---
I was one of those weirdos that sat in Undercity instead of Org becase it was so much more peaceful and stylistically I liked it much more.
---
Well, at least it wasn't a high level disc priest giving you Divine Spirit.
---
Crosspost from the WOW sub, thought you folks would enjoy it
---
imo, that's a small price to pay for being able to play a plate-wearing paladin without getting laughed at.
---
I haven't played since Burning Crusade, the game seemed to be moving in a direction that wasn't what I wanted anymore. I am excited to return to WoW with Classic, and undoubtedly there will be a lot of stuff I forget and may ask for help with in game. I will also go out of my way to help other players, and try to make the community a fun place for anyone that wants it to be :)
---
Parries occur only when your attacker is in front of you. So if melee DPS stands in front of the boss they can trigger parries from the boss, and then the parry haste will smash the tank more often.
---
Lawbringer from Luci.
---
Wow this upped my nostalgia x10. Made me realize I haven't seen original Orgrimmar for 10 years now!
---
Reverse gank is the only description that so accurately explains that. Ha!
---
I get you man. Im excited for Classic too and i THINK i have the, uh, stamina (?) to no life it for the first week but then the sense of "what am i doing with my life" will overcome me.  Shit ive done two 1-10s and a 1-20 run on a pserver just to practice and im already starting to feel the dark side of WoW.
---
Cuz thats what Classic is if you don't really care for the novelty of RPGs and the wonder of exploring. Its the reason the 'no life' term was born with WoW, after a while its just grinding.
---
I mean, that's why I made this post. So I could find others to watch.
---
...I dont know how, but i had kind of forgotten about thorns.  I always liked that buff.
---
Well I'm not gonna miss him if he stays on pservers. It'll make the changes worth it.
---
Leave it to the mentally unstable guy to talk about stability
---
I feel like I'm one of the only people that peruses this sub and actively wants to play on whatever the biggest streamer server is. It essentially means every day will have different "events" going on in whatever zones the streamers are in, plus the economy will be extremely accelerated because of such a high population contributing to a surplus of gathering materials.
---
I find it so odd that so many people here deem the fractured community of retail WoW the reason that they are so excited to return to the interconnectedness of classic, yet they openly shun what will be some of the largest community events in WoW's history.
---
Hi, /u/wolfstryder, your post has been removed as it is seems to be talking about the current stress test. Please use the current [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bui555/stress_test_2_the_megathread_of_omg_why_can_i_not/) instead.
---
Flying mounts made the world feel less of a 'world' and more of a interactive lobby for me. And dungeon finder made it 100x worse.
---
Did I say that? I said you could be alt tabbed for a good chunk of the game aka fly to the skybox ceiling and press numlock. You now fly to your designated destination, dive bomb and barrel roll into the dungeon. 
---
You take the time once for each major flight route; henceforth you can alt tab all flight.
---
Try that in vanilla be alt tabbed from Kargath to UBRS/BWL entrance and tell me how that goes for you when people guard the entrance.
---
Travel and a lot undirected wPvP like lolNagrand was taken out of the equation in TBC which killed a large chunk of the atmosphere.
---
Fanboying pretty hard here. I asked for recommendations, do you have any or do you only watch soda every day?
---
Yes indeed
---
Charge
---
Double white crits + mortal strike crit = dead clothy
---
And if for some reason they aren't dead yet they're almost assuredly in execute range and you should have at least 10-20 rage leftover after charge, two white crits minus mortal strike.
---
Sorry, I typed WoD instead of WotLK. 
---
For me personally I felt once we left Azeroth the world didn't feel the same, it was far too empty once you got to the end game. It was too spread out and lead to people being siloed into their bubble - arena, raids, dungeons. 
---
As for raiding, I can agree it is harder to balance for 40-man raids but LFR is close to that now, and people still mess up so there's definitely room for complexity plus large number of players. I'd sooner see a much more challenging environments and leave it to the players to figure out with the tools limiting classic.
---
For specs, I agree having more diversity is fun and do enjoy the larger trees. It's sort of a double edged sword, I love certain parts of TBC but hate so many, I feel you lose the classic feel once you step into Outlands but would love a way to have those talents or skills in classic.
---
In all honesty, I don't know, I'm an older gamer now, I've been playing WoW since the beta and I'm currently on another 'this expansion sucks' hiatus. I'm sure we'll just end up with TBC but for me Classic as a brand identity feels like it should go it's own way instead of being doomed to repeat history. So for me the idea of playing my 60 hunter again is awesome, and if someone said, hey you don't have to go through the dark portal, instead we've got something completely new I'd take that option.
---
You realized that the layering (not sharding, btw) is only for the launch of Classic to prevent server crashes and then transitions to just one "layer" for everyone on that server, right?
---
Right?
---
I think the server queues will be unavoidable, because probably a million people will be trying to log in at once. No word on server caps yet, but assume it is somewhere around 10k per server... imagine 3k people in Durotar all trying to do the exact same thing at the same time.
---
I have just tried it. Does not work :(
---
&gt;Anal \[For the Children\]
---
Big Ooof...
---
Cow for the extra stamina and the racial ability.
---
Yeah I feel like with classic we're going to see a lot of people playing classes that were mostly unpopular in vanilla. (Warlocks, Druids)
---
Blessing of Freedom is really handy.
---
I'm thinking of maining a warrior, but I'm worriedthat my QoL will not be good at 60 until I level an alt. How tough is it to have money for mount, repairs, consumables, and possibly some respecs if I can only have a max level warrior?
---
Also, what gear do I need to work towards for pvp? Is BiS just rank 13 set and Ashbringer or MoM? I can't find much info on pvp sets, but pve BiS info is all over the place for every stage. Thanks!
---
Possible scaling issue: 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bv83k8/bug_testing_scaling_issue/?
---
Sad how much the horde fails.  Thrall must cry when no one's looking.
---
You could melt faces as a shadow priest or go warrior and reduce enemies to rubble.
---
But we both know that you're gonna go rogue, because that's exactly what rogues do.
---
Your opinion is not fact, stop acting like it is.
---
Maybe your right or maybe classic becomes 10x bigger than retail.
---
Only time will tell
---
Can we get a big post that list their server would like to be far away
---
I don’t watch a ton of streams, but when I do like catching Sonii’s stream. He plays a warrior, played vanilla, isn’t terrible, and is always looking to organize some big pvp events. You can see a highlight of one of his first ones here: https://youtu.be/F03byHw4ZVA (great Asmon kills and lines in there as a bonus for you, lol). I also switch over and watch Kala (priest), Payo (rogue), and Venrukki (mage).
---
I'm not fanboying. Soda isn't the greatest streamer to watch, but he's a good one. Esfand isn't bad. Quin69 is good but he tends to rage so I don't think you'd like him. There's going to be thousands of streamers doing classic, unless you're willing to deal with mainstream-esque streamers there isn't going to be too many standouts.
---
You cannot swap armor in combat. So it has to already be on before engaging in a fight.
---
Spirit is actually great while leveling.
---
If they dont aggro for 5 sec its intended
---
"Flightmaster or Mailbox"  - literally laughing out loud &lt;3
---
Yes! This is why I love healing in PvP. Stealing an HK away from an enemy player is so satisfying, and then to turn the tables so hard that you get one instead. Juicy.
---
Does anyone want to see my \[Small Brown Pouch\]?
---
It is a great upgrade,as far as power spikes go I would say the only comparable is getting Ice Barbed Spear from an AV win at level 51.  About a level 57-59 rare I think, and slow enough as well to be used with mortal strike.  You can even respec to polearms if you are MS already and easily carry it all the way through 60.   
---
For comparison sake, IBS has the same DPS as Arcanite Reaper which is commonly on sale for big money on the AH for fresh level 60s.  And you can get it at 51.  It's great in PVE at that point!
---
10/10.
---
I really love that buffs make such a massive difference in the leveling process. I'm just sad that as a Hunter I don't have any buffs to share =(
---
Then it wouldn't be TBC. No changes please.
---
i played a druid on ely and at least for the first 30 levels or so when areas were busier i buffed every fucker i passed &lt;3
---
Omg haha this place was my favorite!!
---
Yeah, but we actually knew the dungeon, so the groups were happy for the deceit.
---
He speaks English better than a lot of native English speakers, don't be an ass.
---
Interesting that the camera movement isn't the same. But I'm sure there is a reason, and it doesn't impact anything.
---
I never watch a stream before in my life but started watching venruki recently, mostly since I'm planning to play mage and I wanna learn shit. 
---
Dude doesn't take freebies. He just does his own shit with friends and never complains or asks for favours unless he can return the favour. Even when he is streamsnipped he hardly complains. Just pwns them untill they far outnumber him. Just saying, not all streamers are bad.
---
Layering is only being considered as a solution to launch week hype. It's easy to say "people want instant gratification and want to log in now and quest effectively instead of enjoying the experience." I agree that the experience is one-of-a-kind and people need to chill out about not getting a jump start before day 5.
---
But layering as far as I can tell is the alternative chosen over creating lots of servers that will be low-pop or even dead once all the tourists have decided the game isn't for them and stop logging in. Players slough off with literally every game and expansion ever, this isn't an unpredicatable guess, it's going to happen. Layering is I think an attempt to avoid a huge chunk of server merges and forced name changes.
---
I don't think it's ideal, but I don't think oldschool server merges are ideal, either. Nobody wants to lose their name because somebody who quit logging in is squatting on it on the destination server. Layering seems to be more for stability and reducing the pool of servers available to avoid hard merges than it is to appease "gimme gimme now" players. The very nature of Classic is a giant middle finger to those players as it is.
---
Cautious optimism?  On *my* wow forums??
---
OP.
---
Yes, if your staff could reach across the great sea from kalimdor to eastern kingdoms to slap gnomes from the safety of orgrimmar with no increase in your hitbox, sure that'd be ideal. That's not how attack range works in WoW though.
---
Reach and hitbox are inexorably linked. They are synonymous. If you want to attack from father away, you must always be attackable from further away. 
---
Casters kite to keep others within their zone of greatest advantage. Being larger means it's more difficult to kite. If you're a tauren warrior, this also makes you much harder to kite, which is a huge advantage.
---
So, case in point, if you're a tauren resto or ele shaman, eating a SDD to reduce your hitbox gives you an advantage.
---
Still making dumb strawman arguments. 
---
This is not everyone having to change the way the interact with the sub. It is not hard or uncommmon for people to have to flair the posts they make.
---
Can someone explain why its bad to be on a server with a streamer? Is it due to the toxic following or what?
---
[my man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpcmfjFN8OI)
---
if you are dedicated enough you could get a hunter, mage, druid or warlock (suggestion easy levelers) as a miner herber and get both crafting professions on your main warrior.
---
Shitty healthcare, high obesity rate, school shootings, tornados, cold waves, Trump, yeah not really buddy
---
WHAT? they removed buffs????
---
Racials don't matter as much as the player skill. Human will have the edge on threat with the weapon skill, but you'll get an extra point of dodge as a NELF so you'll have a bit better mitigation. When it comes to stat boosting racials, all it really does is give you more flexibility on what gear choices you will be making.
---
Shamans are a bit spammy on the heals in raids but you have tons of utility with your totems and you get to jump in with some casting when there's a drop in damage taken. Plus, reincarnation is a godsend when you wipe and ghost wolf will make waiting for a mount much easier.
---
Chuck Norris' tears cure cancer. Too bad he's never cried..
---
This so much.  I use jump instead as that works better for me, easier to see then to move forward towards the fight or further away, out of range.
---
Also, when you do cast that first BIG heal and you know you are going to allow it to go through, then you need to spam that drink button before it goes off.  Spell batching will allow you to cast the BIG heal and sit and drink before you actually enter combat from the heal.
---
Many people will leave Classic, but the point is that there might be more players on Classic than on Retail even on the long run. 
---
Seeing how much hype the beta gets makes you wonder if they could attract the same amount of people or even half of this amount on a BFA stress test before it came out...
---
Well to be fair Swifty is like 40 already, but I don't disagree. All these people in their twenties playing video games for a living are going to have to face the reality that they won't actually have a marketable skillset in a couple decades. Especially true for those dumbasses that decide to do streaming/esports full-time without a college education.
---
Minor quibble but you used the wrong &gt;!
---
As someone who also gets around 10hrs/week of game time I assure you there will be casual friendly guilds for the likes of us.
---
Should've specified ;)
---
imo the happy medium is to introduce TBC class balance to classic.
---
But, that would dramatically impact classic raiding. People would flip their lids if paladins were MT-viable and people start bringing boomkins and shadow priests to raids.
---
Certainly raiding would be easier for most guilds if their ret paladins and kitty druids were 25% better.
---
Imagine being so delusional that you put a mentally ill person on a pedestal and call him a "public fighter", jeez
---
I mean he also had hot takes like "vanilla raiding was by far the hardest level of raiding any mmo ever had." As someone who has been around all the way to the end of legion clearing everything, that take is a load of horse shit.
---
Atacus has a YouTube video on bis for warrior PvP for phases etc. anything with a lot of stamina is going to be useful. Most of your dps in PvP is determined by your weapon so having a good weapon will give you most of the dps you need. After that you just need to stay alive. 
---
Warrior can farm mobs and can offer tank services for righteous orb reserves etc. 
---
It’s not as lucrative as mage or hunter but you’re just trading more time for the same gold. 
---
It’s not like they just can’t farm gold or something.
---
It’s all easier and more manageable than everyone pretends it is. Everyone will be fine.
---
I'm in Brussels which is bilingual so I don't mind, and any part of USA is shitty in comparison, but hey, good try!
---
&gt;MOST GUILDS don't even clear the current raid on heroic in retail!
---
Okay thats all well and good, except raid finder has more mechanics than the vanilla raids... 
---
Also, if you actually read what I said you'll notice that I said most guilds will be speed running ONCE THE CONTENT IS CLEARED, implying that they've actually cleared it, which they will do because Vanilla raids are a god damn joke and the only bottle neck is getting 40 people to show up with consumables.
---
Facts
---
I love both PVE and PVP and whould like to play both. I am not aiming to be high pvp rank, or try to clear raids in the first weeks they come out but still I want to have fun. Also I have a 9-5 job and want to see friends a few times a week, so this leaves me with like less than 40 hrs a week at best.   
---
As I see it arms is the choice for PVP and fury for PVE. Is Arms really that bad for PVE? Am I going to be able to find groups for dungeons and raids? Also can I be arms talents but with high hit rating gear dual-wielding weapons for PVE? Something like this -&gt;  [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/BeMzcxM0AzPCMAA](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/BeMzcxM0AzPCMAA)   
---
My other solution that I am thinking of is 60 Fury warrior for PVE and like 49 twink arms warrior for the times when I want to have fun in PVP :)
---
Lok'Tar Omar!
---
&gt;layering (not sharding, btw)
---
Please don't support Blizzard's rebrand. It's like comcast rebranding to xfinity, it's still the same thing, their PR department is just trying to get rid of the negative connotation. 
---
We already saw on the stress test that you have to rely on group invites in order to get to different shards, so it's the same thing.
---
I started in mid-Wrath, had RaF (i think that was an xp boost, wasnt it?  Though i guess we didnt level together a lot?), and had a friend of the person that referred me running us through dungeons here and there.
---
It still took me just over a month to get to 80.  I was looking that up recently and was fucking floored that it *still* took me that long on my first toon with all the advantages i had.  Shit, i even had addons! (carbonite told me where quest stuff was).
---
I like the idea of playing on an EU server to avoid the streamers, but I worry it'll just be a repeat of private servers and not just in pings.  A bunch of insular communities speaking in languages I don't speak.
---
I can hear this image
---
Thisbis what we need
---
Oh boy are you wrong...
---
I seriously am considering going druid main over hunter because I just feel so great running through leveling towns giving buffs to people. The warriors who get thorns do seem the happiest
---
I don't remember what dropped there besides the water breathing staff but if it had good hunter loot and no wipes I'd have went along with it. But if I were trying for gear in the other instance I'd prolly just leave. I'll prolly hit up Gnomer at least once and see if its as bad as kid me thought it was.
---
Holy, that would be some toxic ass warrior, kited around like a puppy and blaming everything on class balance I guess? And with tons of macros spamming "get rekt omegalul"
---
Hands up to the people who dont roll horde for the OP pvp racials, respect!
---
Same opinion as you, just play the game don't need laying and wow didn't need it before so don't add it now
---
I wont be.  Ill be in Ironforge :)
---
Okay
---
If you don’t have to flair posts now
---
And you change it so people have to flair all posts
---
How is that not changing the way people interact with the sub?
---
WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING
---
Sonii is a really down to earth and positive Horde streamer!
---
I can answer your first part, think of Warrior like a real life police man. If you’re doing it correctly you will be broke. Repairs are expensive, gear and enchants are expensive. Respect is expensive. If you are MT of your guild you can’t expect a lot of monetary support.
---
That said, if you charge for services you can offset a lot of your costs. You can tank for hire (I didn’t do that) you’ll make money but beware the possibility of reputation degradation on your server.
---
I chose to play auction house. Did ok but rarely had more than 100g at any time because every time I had money it went to improving my gear. I was also a MT of a semi successful guild. They helped out where they could.
---
How is it selfish? This would prevent the chaos from even happening
---
Is it that? Or is it another resource to learn about the game?
---
Esfand is definitely a nice streamer, can't argue with that! But it's not about watching or not, it's how they fuck up the servers :/
---
I mean if they are in rank 14 gear it’s a lot easier to perform well than someone in average gear. 
---
That’s why those warrior montage videos of people three shotting everyone is a tough display of skill. 
---
I’d suggest watching monkey news’ leveling videos. He has tons of PvP at Lower levels with gear from that level and performing well. Shows a bit more in the skill department rather than someone who may be skilled but the gear is doing the lifting
---
I'd actually rather them *not* push the envelope too much. Part of what I'm looking forward to is not feeling like there's a treadmill. I don't have time for that anymore, I just wanna be able to log in every now and then and play without getting *too* drastically passed by. Recognizing that I will, to some extent.
---
Edit: But I may be the minority... *shrug*
---
Precisely the problem, some said they won't say which server they start in at launch so you could start not knowing it :/
---
Anal \[Backstep\]
---
For the night elf version is there a place where I can graft it into the more fleshed-out human run if I wanted to go past level 8? I don't have access to test it out so its hard to imagine all the steps involved, but they look a little different once the elf reaches Elwynn.
---
We're not really going to pretend his fans aren't giving him free shit right? I've seen people giving him gold and items several times. Not that there is anything wrong with that, just saying it makes it unfair to say he doesn't have any advantages compared to a non-streaming player. That's just a lie.
---
I will only take tbc if they make draenei the original broken ones we encountered in W3.
---
Ion was quoted saying no layering at all in phase 2
---
What about neither one of them?
---
Chuck Norris roundhouse kicked a bullet once and that is how JFK was shot
---
yeah this forum is weirdly moderated. endless debate about BFA vs classic wow but when I tried to post a thread about macros that work on beta/stress test I got told to 'take it to the stress test thread' which is just a big scroll of people whining they cant log in.
---
someone may have to make a sub for classic wow play and theorycrafting. this seems like a meme + BFA debate sub mostly at the moment
---
Out of curiosity, how did he do?
---
&gt; Also how many servers did they have at launch again?
---
I have no idea what this is supposed to mean, can you clarify? Do you think wow will have 1 realm?
---
the bulk of things which make sharding undesirable are present in layering
---
TBC was a great expansion, aside from being an expansion at all (trivialization of most/all previous content). I also think 'Classic+' is the way forward in the future; I don't understand people who want Vanilla, TBC, and WotLK to all exist at the same time, not to mention the 'expansion problem' with TBC and WotLK. Integrating this content into Classic with Classic's design philosophy is seriously the best of both worlds.
---
As you said, OSRS is a perfect example and people really need to pay more attention to how that one was handled when talking/thinking about the future of Classic WoW.
---
I thought a few hunters were needed for tranq shots and stuff. Anyway I think people worry too much about raid spots, most guilds would take you. Not every guild is gonna be going for world firsts, most will just wanna be able to get 40 people together to begin with.
---
at 100G of course
---
My bad, everytime I went there I only heard french, so I thought it was the main of their three languages, sorreh
---
Or you just keep increasing ilvl past naxx gear? Why can't this be done? I would, however, keep it so that you had to raid older content to progress to the highest tier gear. Releasing 20-mans to compliment gearing in MC/BWL/AQ/NAXX/future raid is perfectly fine, but I absolutely would NOT use the same catch-up mechanics they use in retail and make it so early tier raids are pointless to run.
---
I don't have any estimates on how many people played vanilla but depending on what you mean by fraction it might not be that much of a difference.
---
Next one to poorly meme gets a taste of my [Forest Leather Belt]
---
Ironically, as a US player, the only streamers I would want to play on the same realm with are all EU. Go figure.
---
For purely nostalgia reasons my main is always a Prot Warrior. I also probably have less hours/day than you, and I will still roll as Prot. It makes dungeon runs easier to find a group for being a tank, so less time wasted finding a group. As another poster replied there a tons of casual guilds out there to join to take on some of the lower tier raids from time to time. 
---
I would suggest rolling on a PvE server though, because being Prot you will be nearly helpless against most 1v1 PvP scenarios. At least that has been my experience...but I suck at PvP.
---
A few thoughts-
---
Drop the +defense in the 1st tier of prot and get 4/5 toughness instead.  Put the leftover point 1/3 improved shield block as blocking the extra attack is a cool boost and will help a ton whenever you tank.  4/5 toughness will provide you a lot more benefit in PVP especially. 
---
Drop improved sunder armor and get improved disarm instead.  Much more helpful in PVP.  Any spare rage probably shouldn't go to sunders, instead going to shield slam on cooldown, hamstring, disarm, or whirlwind.  
---
Drop 2/3 improved HS and put it into improved overpower.  This will give overpower like.. 65-70% crit which will help get deep wounds on your target and be a nice damage boost as well.  Very handy against other warriors or rogues (as if you needed more help vs rogues with this build.. but still)
---
You'll probably want to not wear defense gear in PVP, but the one exception would be a gear piece that adds block value as this will boost your shield slam a good amount.
---
Depends on what you're going for. I've gone both in vanilla, and sword spec and had way better damage than axe. Axe will get you the extra crit chance but your only option for extra attacks is hand of justice (or windfury if you're horde,) which is only 2%. Stack hand of justice and sword spec and you have a 7% chance to get extra hits. These extra hits can crit too, leading to bigger rage gains and more damage. I guess go axe if you're horde and have a pocket shaman, go sword if you're alliance and want better damage.
---
Holy priest is a good choice but be aware that leveling might be a bit tougher - probably a good idea to level as shadow since you'll still be able to heal in dungeons before you're 60.
---
Paladin is easier to solo level with but combat mostly just consists of putting on a seal and smacking the mobs to death, and in raids you'll be the most mana-efficient healer but you'll also just spam one button most of the time. When you level you'll probably want to go retribution, however, which means you'll have to pick up two different sets of gear along the way.
---
Druid is otherwise really fun to level as since you have a lot of variety but end-game healing is a bit more tricky since more of your healing consists of HoTs and your direct heals have a bit slower cast time - but it's absolutely viable! I'd recommend this the most, personally.
---
I can imagine that on pservers but up until Cata this wasn't a problem as I remember. Is it now?
---
Otherwise I wouldn't worry about that, I think it's against the ToS to speak non-english on a server that's meant to be english.
---
Damn. I personally don’t mind streamers, it’s the cultish hivemind that blindly follows them that I have an issue with. Alright well I’ll do my best to pick Ana inconspicuous sounding realm lol.
---
Is it really better to vendor skins rather than using AH?
---
My body is ready for classic.
---
I have a 1080p 144 hz btw :)
---
GM's have been spawning world bosses and raid bosses into populated areas during the stress tests. Looks like they spawned Sapphiron in the stormwind castle
---
Could someone remake this with the "oh no it's retarded" text in the last frame?
---
when i was a wee noobling i was in stormwind and my friends told me on ts about the sewer beast - a huge rare spawn crocodile that occasionally appeared in the stormwind canal
---
they said they found it, and they put on such a good acting job that i fully believed them and i thought i was bugged because i couldnt see it.  we played chicken in the water and they got all excited about it chasing us and said shit like "its just behind us, run, get out of the water!" and i was pooping my pants and trying to get to safety  
---
of course, they were making it all up lol
---
Yes. Look at my other commands. I literally said the game is fine with introducing its own stories as you level up. Putting Broken Draenei in game at level 1 as playable race =/= finding out they're here too, now, at level 40+.
---
he said he might play na with esfand
---
I'm on vacation in France in bourgondy atm. Beautiful and amazing place. Great food, great people. The sun is shining and I'm sitting on a bench in the village where we are staying, drinking a great and rich local wine.
---
I spat it all out when scrolled through the comments and read your reply hahahahaha, so simple but too funny. Here's to you!
---
He's never been the face of Classic and never will be.
---
1) Be out of combat.
---
2) Equip item.
---
3) Wait 30 seconds (you can enter combat during this time). 
---
4) Use item. 
---
5) Wait for duration of item. 
---
6) Wait until you leave combat (if you haven't already). 
---
7) Equip item with better stats.
---
I like when I made a post like this about 3-5 months ago all I got was hate for making fun of this comment, everyone just defended it, but I suppose such is life on Reddit
---
Imagine not knowing most WoW players are precisely millenials. Imagine being dense enough to think millenials are all attention whores. Just imagine.
---
I don't think they're considerate enough to do that. But hey, wait and see
---
And who says that the increase in power must OBLITERATE former gear?
---
The increase in power MUST exists, ofc there is no point in getting new gear otherwise. Let's look at T2, T2.5 and T3 in Classic. There was a clear power gain item to item...but A LOT of gear that dropped in T2 and T2.5 raid content was still used by players that raided and cleared Naxx.
---
In other words, there was NO NEED to drastically increase gear power in Vanilla, from T2 to T3. Today, it's even more clear that we can tackle higher tier raids without fully gearing in lower tier raids.
---
The gain in power can be MINIMAL, while not feeling completely irrelevant.
---
But look at TBC Tier 4, 5 and 6.
---
The difference in power is ABSURD. T6 is MILES ahead of T4. In Classic, T3 was better than T2...but much less powerful than T6 vs T4.
---
So...it can be done. It is possible to add better gear, without completely making former gear irrelevant.
---
Sure, there will be a point where the differences will be massive...but that point can be 5 years away, instead 2.
---
This is what I am saying, actually. There can be 1.13 gear, that is better than T3...but only SLIGHTLY better.
---
Power creep is UNAVOIDABLE...but it can be postponed, and skewed, to keep old content as relevant as possible for as long as possible.
---
How do you not feel violated even being in such a guild? I don't get it. I would cringe so hard and nope into next week.
---
How hard is it to level as a prot warrior? Or at least when can a warrior start going into a more prot build?
---
If you pick the shaman, you can still choose to go tauren druid as a consolation prize if you change your mind. If you pick night elf, the shaman is completely off the table.
---
Ahh ye, my bad, only got that bomb once, ran to the proper spot and instantly overaggroed with instant Shadowbolts, so it all mixed up in my memory :)
---
+5 weapon skill is basically 1% hit and a small boost to crit. You also do more damage on glancing blows. Weapon skill is huge in Vanilla/Classic.
---
It was and is.
---
Yes. He's either a troll or an Alex Jones inspired insane person, and therefore should be ignored.
---
"You're reading comprehension is bad." has sure become just a generic reach-for jab with absolutely no context relating to actual reading comprehension; hasn't it?
---
There should be plenty of opportunities for all kinds of playtime restricted folks who want to do things like tank.  5 mans are always available, require less gear and groups can be found or made near instantly.  
---
Also, the high end raiding you read about a lot here will be a small amount of the total guilds and raids going on.  There will be a place for nearly everyone, you'll just have to look around a bit.
---
Hitbox = Reach. 
---
Get out of your fantasy land where they aren't the same thing.
---
while "phasing" is only applied to quests lines etc. Thanks for the read :)
---
Nah don't worry! The servers are divided according to language, so you have the english, the french, the spanish, the italian and the german iirc, mostly ! You can choose whatever from all those
---
I was thinking that; level a Druid and herb/mine but it’s harsh to level in vanilla. But as a tank it would probably be better to have a farming too for gold.
---
Alright what servers should I avoid then? US player here. Friends are forcing Alliance unfortunately
---
Not good enough. I want nanosecond accuracy!
---
because there are negatives, arcane intellect costs mana
---
The thing that ruined it for me was pvp and over separation. Why would I raid when my gear doesn’t let me go fuck people up in pvp? I loved the feeling of being a giant after getting good gear in pve.
---
I mean, you could always not download it and not use it to keep the classic experience. As someone that played classic while it was live, I welcome all the QoL changes some addons will bring.
---
\-&gt; please never change, STV
---
Yeah, travel time of light between Paris and San Francisco is about 45 ms in a fiber optic cable. So you'd have to add at least that time to whatever time you already have locally.
---
See i thought that 2 but i saw him accept a gold trade the other day. Small amount, like a few gold, but even so. Nothing that makes me write the guy off as a cringefest yet, but i do hope he maintains his integrity.
---
A lot of classes are also kinda boring to play until at least lvl 20 ish,  I think people that get to that point will keep going, but a lot will stop before that
---
I'm just not really sure you would want to for any reason. You can tank fine with the DPS specs in levelling dungeons, and if you go prot even with all that defense you'll probably still have to do a bunch of eating because your damage will be so low it'll take you forever to kill enemies. That said.. its vanilla, do whatever you want. it won't be "hard", it'll just be slow as mollases and frustrating
---
If people **here** stopped downvoting simple questions to oblivion maybe we wouldn't need a sub for that.
---
Cool thanks.
---
That's exactly what everyone wants. 
---
Nobody is jealous of streamer's success and money so they want to avoid them. 
---
It's the fucking 100+ horde of attention-starved locusts who plague every game they go to that they want to avoid.
---
You can do it at level 30 with a full and competent group. Might need to pop a consumable or two. For the Cyclonian, a nature resist potion has more value than a healing potion since it absorbs more damage than a healing pot can heal at that level. 33-35 should be ezmode.
---
Have you played on the beta or stress test servers? I'm just curious if you've experienced it yourself.  
---
I would happily take a name change if I have to over allowing this broken system in the game AT ALL. I also do not trust that Blizzard will remove it correctly. It also has weird bugs where people from other 'layers' / 'servers' suddenly end up on your layer. So we had lvl 18s and 19s in kour lvl 10 WSGs and we had high level stuff on thew AH that shouldn't be there.   
---
Layering is NEW BLIZZ and old fans should shout it down like we shouted down this BFA and 'you think you do, but you dont' nonsense. I have 0 faith in this system
---
Thanks for the fast response.
---
Would this mean you try to balance your utility and stats. I would imagine have on the engineering, boots, helm, cloak, belt, and trinkets all at the same time would reduce offensive and defensive stats quite a bit.
---
Note: with the long cool downs I know you will swap out to your normal items for quite a bit of the BG.
---
Healing 5-mans as ret isn't that difficult as long as you have the bag space to keep some intellect gear to switch to in dungeons. Healing as a paladin is very repetitive, however, you basically only use one ability most of the time.
---
As a priest, you'll be the most sought after raid healer in the game and you'll have the option to go shadow to melt faces as a DPS in PvP if you change your mind.
---
Two good options but if you're dead set on healing in both PvP and PvE then go Paladin, if you want to be able to hold your own in PvP then go priest.
---
&gt; To do that, we’re planning to mirror the approach taken by original WoW, with patches paired together. We’ll launch Classic with content from original WoW through patch 1.2.x, then the second update will include content that was in original WoW 1.3 and 1.4, the third Classic update will have 1.5 and 1.6 content, and so on.
---
Direct quote from the blizzard post.
---
Most people (I feel) fail to think of changes to the world as content. They tend to only think of dungeon/raid content when “content” is mentioned with these phases.
---
Example: There’s already been discussion with priests about Benediction. The consensus is that it won’t be obtainable because despite Executus being available at launch, his loot wasn’t added until 1.4 (phase 2). This is all based on content staggering of the phases. Same goes for Thunderfury (bindings weren’t added until 1.6, plus mats wouldn’t be available until p3 bring BWL anyways).
---
Safe to assume the rewards from Gurubashi will be similar. although I feel that it’d be nice to have at launch. It’d give us another place to go for pvp where we know others will be at certain times.
---
What a bro.
---
The original world record? 4 days 20 hours 1-60.
---
Addon makes the experience better. Don’t have to read the quests anymore.
---
OP post a selfie so we can roast your neckbeard ass thx
---
Alright, that's a good point. I hate throwing money down the drain. 
---
Cheers.
---
I like Esfand. I think he is pretty cool :)
---
Thats anecdotal. For me, I played a fuck ton of BG's from 2005 onward and never knew anyone to use this on either side.
---
When did wow become a fashion show?
---
Tanks are always in demand friend. If you EU Alliance you are welcome to mu guild, we are casual friendly
---
Unless you're a Troll and it boosts that awesome racial you've got!    /s
---
I guess I don't understand the impact of streamers and why there would be such a desire to play or not play with them.
---
Is it economy concerns? Is it event concerns? Is it something else entirely? 
---
I just don't see what all the fuss is about.
---
True, true, it's hard to separate the streamer from its community I feel, but we should...
---
You can’t look at the draeni women and say their models are ugly. They are incredibly feminine and pretty compared to orcs or trolls.
---
The naga hated the Night Elves though.
---
Esfand? Is that you?
---
Perhaps you shouldn't have commented at all if you're only going to bring negativity into the discussion.
---
Yes and I told him in other comments that it's a different thing to add new stories for the world to develop it further as you level up ajd uncover new areas but at level 1 world she be more or less as we have known it from WC3:TFT. The Broken Draenei being introduced to players in SoS falls exactly into what I'm talking about, introducing them as playable native Azeroth race from day 1 does not or at least that's how I'm seeing it and obviously how Blizzard went with it, too. ; )
---
Female orcs are hideous...
---
Am I missing a joke here? That's Sapphiron.
---
I'm not a min maxer, I mostly want to have fun and the thematics and identity of my character means a lot to me. I like nature and stuff, but I'm torn between druid or hunter. I like healing, so part of me wants to go resto druid. I've never been a fan of shapeshifting though and I'm worried solo/world content will be a pain in the ass and I'll just have to use kitty/bear form the entire time to get anything done without losing sanity.
---
Because of that I'm torn between druid and hunter, I like dps too, I'm not worried about it being low dps, I'm not a competitive person. I like the old systems like multiple weapons, ranged and melee, ammo and taking care of your pet. My only worry with hunter is I'll get bored because I find their ranged combat pretty dull. I prefer spells and stuff for ranged, or just straight up melee.
---
I'll probably level both as I'm duo levelling with someone for at least one of them, and the other will be solo during our downtime. Just not sure which I want to commit to.
---
Congratulations for showing everyone what a virtous person you are on the Internet.
---
You’d still generate more threat as a troll, which is more important at the highest end where people have to hold off their dps (especially horde side) to allow for tank threat to build.
---
A public fighter? The guy can barely form coherent sentences half the time. You can't claim he doesnt take bribes when nobody is offering him any. Hes a toxic part of the community, who hasn't helped do anything.
---
It also killed world pvp.
---
I think wow classic is harder in most aspects. Alot more micro managing with talents etc. (talents were also a major difference) classic raids, rewards felt worthy... Wasn't so catered to a younger audience or an audience with a lower attention span...
---
Man those were the days
---
Defcamp:  Genuinely the most positive dude out there right now, great vibes, plays a priest and takes it easy.
---
MonkeyNews:  Part of the Apes crowd and one of the most knowledgable dudes in the game.  The Nopes group is notoriously good at the game on private servers and if you're looking to see people pull of content no one else can do its them.
---
Kargoz:  Dude loves to speed level and have a good time.  The people he rolls with like Navak will end up being some of the top players NA.
---
What is wrong with you?
---
How are quest addons any different than the multi-screens people will be using with a guide/map pulled up
---
Rule 2:  Be Civil and Respectful
---
I like your optimism but somethings are off.  Debuffs are really important for vanilla, and suggesting to sneak in a debuff that doesnt help anyone other than rets like myself is the wrong kind of mentality when you are trying to prove to the community that rets are viable.  Ive been in 3 guilds with a ret, and i disagree that in a semi hardcore or casual guild, that rets will have equal prio to a rogue or fury.  Lets say, there are 2 furies and 2 rets.  The first flamewalker gloves drop and the raid gives it to a ret.  Everyone has sput on equal effort.  All the furies will be pissed.  Furies will try less because their effort is not rewarded.  Furies leave guild for another that hands out loot more efficiently.  This creates tension early on between players.  Now if the fury gets the gloves first, nobody bats an eye.  If the fury sees the crusader debuff on the boss, he will question what this ret is really trying to do.  Prove his dps or help his guild?  I wish you the best of luck.
---
cataclysm when transmog was introduced 🙂
---
That might have been me! I give motw to locks/hunters, thorns to pets, and if i have time motw to the pet as well. Everyone else gets motw/thorns.
---
It's big enough to be worth considering when choosing your race. +5 skill without having to get specific gear is a big boon.
---
And when someone decides to stream anyway? Ban the most influential player on the entire server? Give them a free server transfer that no one else gets? 
---
When someone argues that "I'm not streaming, I've just set up a script to upload videos to YouTube every 10 seconds"? 
---
When a streamer streams from the server but has chat blocked and player names turned off? Should blizzard employ someone to manually match character races, classes, and gear to player locations from those servers?
---
The only problem with adding new content aimed below the level cap is that players already at the level cap sort of miss out on it. Whether or not this is a big deal depends on what kind of content it is, but it's something to consider. Not every player wants to level a new alt, but every player will eventually reach the level cap if they keep playing long enough.
---
Comments are drinking the koolaid.
---
Dear lord. That's quite the dollaridoo
---
I appreciate your feedback. Personally, I was thinking that restoration shamans would be viable for their burst healing (Nature's Swiftness + Chain Heal/Healing Wave), totemic support, and purge abilities. Even dropping a mana tide totem in the base if the situation calls for it.
---
It's unusual for farming? I made all my gold in Vanilla AoE farming with my Paladin.
---
I'd rather stick to melee
---
It drops gear.  That means it drops hunter gear.
---
your soul seems pretty ugly tbh
---
Amusing. I didnt bother reading the article. The topic name suggests its severely flawed and ignorant
---
rose-tinted glasses. 99% of those players arent going to be there at 60 when they realize they have nothing to do
---
I wouldn't make a pvp prot spec no.  Now if you are in prot spec you can do some things in pvp such as carry the flag, tank AV bosses and towers, be a flag spinner in AB and peel for your healers and clothies.  What you cannot do is kill people.
---
This isn't to say I fully disagree with you, but you're describing a single player experience. Growth is the only thing that will motivate players. That could be levels or gear or professions, but there must be growth. You may not like the new level caps, but they exist. Because they are fun. The growth just has to mean something. 
---
I enjoyed starting over in BC and wrath because I'd exhausted most of the content.
---
Alexsensual trying to stay relevant. At some point the tinfoil hat wears out, just a friendly tip.
---
He is a streamer no? Not a porn actor
---
How to tell someone didn't *actually* play in 2004-06
---
The idea is to stick to the principles that make Classic Wow Classic. I don't understand why so many people are taking features that ruined the classic feel and use that to say they shouldn't do this.
---
He's saying they would redevelop the expansion to stick to the classic experience and you're saying "no don't do that, because there was a feature that didn't stick to the classic experience".
---
"[Ye we'd change that, hello?]"
---
Starting out probably vend because the AH will be saturated and everyone will be broke so vending helps infuse the server with money.
---
Oof, that's a tough one. But seeing as how you want to control the battle, I'd say it's more between Warlocks and Mages. Warlocks get utility against both casters and melee classes, however, so I'd suggest Warlock.
---
Yeah, his streams usually aren't like that. He recently gambled away all his gold, which was hilarious. He's said a few times that he doesn't care about gold on the beta so I think he's just messing around.
---
Then theres also raid setup. 3 pallies can buff a whole raid for 15 mins, vs 8 shamans  for 5 min stationary area totems. So you have slightly better class flexibility as alliance.
---
The only must-have thing shamans can bring better than pallies are Tremor and Mana tide totems
---
Right, do it now you just piss off a large-ish community without providing an alternative. Do it  in three months though....
---
Both were good. TBC was a more polished version of the Vanilla systems and opened up a lot of gameplay by making other specs viable in areas they weren't in Vanilla, especially tanking. Only real bad thing about TBC for the game was Flying Mounts and I guess maybe arena because it shifted the focus of PvP away from the world/BGs to a small instanced battle (even though arena and it's reward systems in TBC were very good).
---
I've been a Vanilla advocate for years, but the reasons are twofold. I loved Vanilla and have wanted to play it again since it ended, but also because TBC is my favorite expansion and I'd love to progress from Vanilla to TBC again. I'm definitely not saying that's most people here, but there are a few of us that really want to progress through Vanilla to BC to Wrath again. But not Cata cause we aren't crazy.
---
Mara and BRD are lower level dungeons to begin with, so your original progression is pretty accurate. Mara is basically a leveling dungeon, but BRD has TONS of gear that's pre-raid BIS or BIS in general. I'd say - BRD &gt; LBRS &gt; Strath &gt; Scholo &gt; UBRS. All the level 60 content is fairly equal in difficulty - they just bring different challenges to the table.
---
20 man raids are the sweet spot in my opinion. By having 40 it really makes it tough to attend for that duration. Not just the dungeon time, but organization time and all that. I played in 2005 and now I own a house and have a baby on the way, I've actually decided I probably won't ever raid again which is sad.
---
Same.  Cata was fine, it was just trying to do a 180 from wrath's clown fiesta damage/healing which could only piss off a ton of people and then the developers weren't able to deliver the content.  Launch dungeons &amp; raids were awesome, firelands was awesome...but too few bosses for an entire tier, and we all know how it ended...the last dungeons were good though
---
In TBC things were more balanced looking at both damage &amp; Healing numbers(wrath was insane,looking more at pvp) and individual spec usefulness where most specs had a niche that they excelled at, although some still lagged until wrath(most people would say Ret though we did have a paladin that was huge on theorycrafting and loved Ret and he was able to bring competitive damage in Sunwell when we'd let him :).
---
They overhauled and updated pretty much all the classes and improved on what you already loved in vanilla while wrath changed the way many specs and classes played.  I really did not like changes to mage from a raiding perspective though if I had to do it over I would have switched to ele shaman instead of quitting.
---
It had attunements and no catchup mechanics(until sunwell) but that also gave you a great sense of progression and accomplishment.
---
I dont know ask Captain_Negative
---
This is almost non-enforceable.
---
I think a lot of people throw the word "streamer" around for any kind - no matter the target audience, fanbase, or the activity. When we are talking about the "negative" streamer, most people are probably talking about people like Asmongold: *huge streamers with potentially thousands of troll followers*.
---
And I like Asmongold. Don't get me wrong. Occasionally I do think he is hilarious and - shame on me - I have watched some of his videos.
---
This is the kind of streamer most people are worried about.
---
But what if Johnny Average suddenly decides to do a social night and streams his Dire Maul run for tips and guidance? Has he violated the server rules and must be punished? Forcefully moved off the server?
---
Listen, I get it. Trolls aren't fun. But streaming is here to stay. You can most likely take steps to minimize its impact on *your* experience, but arbitrary restrictions won't help.
---
&gt; What if the game only experiences slow growth for a couple years rather than drops people more than it gains? **Then layering will stay.** 
---
Could you stop pulling shit out of your ass please?   
---
No one besides Blizzard knows what they will do if that happens, so stop spreading misinformation.
---
Odd, I think he’s a good looking dude. Very friendly also..
---
No homo
---
Oh dang, is Kala the c9 arena team manager?
---
Omg. I remember seeing this when I was little and wondering what it meant!! Holy shit. What’s crazy is all these random memories of WC3 came flooding into my brain when I saw this.  I saw this back in high school  and thought nothing of it but in 2005 my friend who was a huge Warcraft and Starcraft fan was like “why aren’t you playing wow” and I was like I dunno what that is.  Next thing you know Im playing the demo on my old dell desktop with terrible frames. I create a dorf warrior and he’s helping me get used to the controls and overarching purpose of the game. I had never touched an MMO before. I was playing thru the game and enjoying it but not really understanding the true purpose of it.  Endgame was a foreign concept to me at the time. But the moment I knew I was hooked was when I first flew into stormwind on a gryphon and the music started playing. It just all felt so epic and larger than myself.  My friends name was Jon but he passed away couple years ago. Thank you Jon. You’ll never know how much you enriched my youth.
---
Yea, apparently he gambled away all his money lol. Well nobody is perfect but I like his attitude to the game. Doesn't take it or himself to seriously but still plays on a high level.
---
I reckon Frost would only attract chill players (no pun intended).
---
That Druid is a absolute LEGEND
---
Not as hard or slow as people make it out to be. 1h+shield, 2h, and 2x1h are balanced around each other to where while yes the first option does less damage, you will also take less damage thus reducing downtime. See this post by a dev for more info:  https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/69365-18-02-05-kalgans-response-to-warriors/
---
However, I would suggest either getting another 1h to dw or get 2h. This way you can have more dps on demand if needed.
---
Does your country law allows to name your child that?
---
- Toxic community spamming "invite to layer pls" for example or debating the stream, or just omegalulling over whatever
---
- Crushing the enemy faction until they're discouraged from playing there, creating poor balance.
---
- Ahn'Qiraj mount goes to the streamer on your server. Pretty much certain. 
---
- On a bigger scale than a guilder leader, streamers will receive gold and items, getting a huge advantage in pvp or pve, that's minor but still.
---
And others fun things I'm not motivated enough to note
---
I think for most of the streamers they don’t like the affect their audience has on the game. In fact most probably resent the fact that no matter where they go on a server, they’ll always be followed to the end of the earth by attention seeking fans, it’s just an unfortunate consequence of their “fame”. I know asmongold spoke about how he knows he’ll never get that pure experience simply because there will be swaths of people swarming to his server.
---
What's holding the lower bow? Lol
---
Thats even longer I guess if you are in UK playing on NA West?
---
yeah nooo
---
True, his raiding experience only went through the first tier of Cata, AFAIK. And he was also raiding in a very different way than most people, pushing for world firsts, so his view of difficulty may be skewed by factors outside of raid mechanics. All that being said it's still hard to believe he'd find vanilla raids harder than like pre-nerf T5 content, or Sunwell, though I think he viewed that as not hard mechanic-wise, just super overtuned.
---
I liked TBC a lot, even more than Vanilla. I've been on the classic hype train for years now, and I've always been hoping we would have Vanilla-&gt;BC.
---
Mage is absolutely a good leveler - high damage output, decent amount of CC, and you can conjure your own food and water to recover between fights. Priests are more viable for leveling as shadow, but you'll always be wanted for dungeons since you'll be able to heal regardless of your spec. If you wanna be able to get groups together for dungeons quickly then go priest, if you plan on mostly skipping dungeons or planning runs with a group of friends then go mage.
---
For some reason I held my thumb on the upvote button thinking a laughing emoji would show up
---
It was added in 2.4.0, Fury of the Sunwell :)
---
that was possible early in vanilla but since classic is based on 1.12 game mechanics there will be global combat on all raid bosses and on some raid trash (not most).
---
Peaceful server? Its World of WARcraft, not farmville. Epic brawls between factions are one of the best parts.
---
Math can’t be wrong you doughnut. 
---
The mathematical processes are correct, there must be a problem with the values, titles, or data somehow. 
---
Did you think I was going to watch every single video you linked so I could convince a 15 year old that math can’t be wrong?
---
I’m trying to save you from sounding like a moron and going around telling people math wrong.
---
Did a bit of searching and found the source for the macro I used. As I mentioned earlier, it works on Vanilla, but I seriously doubt it will work on Classic. Remember, the macro all 1 line. If you're below max level, you can easily modify the macro to handle the ranks of PW:Fort that you actually have. Change "for i=6,1,-1 do" by replacing the 6 with the highest rank of PW:Fort that you currently know.
---
/script Pre="Power Word: Fortitude(Rank " Sp={1,2,14,26,38,50} if (UnitLevel("target") ~= nil and UnitIsFriend("player","target")) then
---
for i=6,1,-1 do if (UnitLevel("target") &gt;= Sp[i]) then CastSpellByName(Pre..i..")") return end end end
---
I could see a “re-imagined” Karazhan. Use the TBC dungeon world art as a base, but just redo all the mobs and data so to speak. Doesn’t require any additional art assets, takes mostly design resources. It could be a lot of fun.
---
&gt; I love both PVE and PVP and whould like to play both. I am not aiming to be high pvp rank, or try to clear raids in the first weeks they come out but still I want to have fun. Also I have a 9-5 job and want to see friends a few times a week, so this leaves me with like less than 40 hrs a week at best.
---
I want your time management skills.
---
lol. That's because WoW and OSRS are not the same type of game..? They actually have nothing incommon except for the fact that it's an mmo genre. 
---
In WoW you add expansions to actually continue shit, new places to level and new hubs to be at because the latest content is there. in OSRS you don't even have a capital.. the only reason people go to varrock is because you have the auction house there, just like orgrimmar in WoW.
---
What a weak ass comparsion dude, "see old school runescape as an example"
---
There are a large amount of xp awarded from quests.  Rogues can skip to the item or named monster, while warriors have to clear up to them.  Rogues also have more cooldowns that can start recharging after they kill something and start regenerating health moving to the next area or pull.  Rogues start with 100 energy each pull and warriors essentially start at zero and have to build up.  If you are looking for a dungeon group, warriors will be a lot easier to get an invite as long as you have defensive gear to tank the dungeon.
---
Shadowmeld is incredibly powerful. Its a 6 second cd iirc which is nuts.
---
Does anyone have actual dps stats or proof of sword spec ending up being more beneficial. Its all good for a 5% chance for an extra attack but when axe spec pushes you to near 30% chance to crit, is sword spec more damage than critting 3-4 times in a row?
---
or perhaps let people play they way they see fit?
---
yeah lets go with that
---
Don’t use them, problem solved.
---
&gt; I'm just going to run this by the raid comps of the days of old and see how likely it is to get the chance to roll on gear.    
---
&gt; Example being; -12 plate pieces drop -6 leather -9 cloth -10 mail 
---
Not all those 12 pieces are going to be useful, your gonna have completly trash items that no one rolls on, or very few will likly roll on skew your results.
---
If they roll a character on a server where streaming is not allowed, then yes, ban them.  Why can’t “influencers” follow the rules?
---
Well, a lot of people are saying the same thing, that MMO market is fairly weak. But all of them fail to understand a simple thing : the MMO market is split between 25, maybe 30 MMOs, while the mobile market is split between 2,000+ games.
---
It is MUCH MORE profitable to have a 5% share of a market that is valued at 40 billions a year, instead a 0.1% share of a market valued at 70 billion a year.
---
Its simple math.
---
Yes, OVERALL, the MMO market is weaker, but the competitors in the MMO market are much fewer than those on mobile. MUCH FEWER.
---
And their income, bar a handful of mobile game companies, are BIGGER than everyone else's in the mobile game market.
---
Just look at WoW, as it is TODAY, the lowest point in WoW history : it is making more money than 95% of the mobile game companies. Simply because there are thousands of mobile game companies that make CRUMBS in the 70 billion market that they share.
---
MMO genre is not dead. Far from it.
---
WoW Classic should be an evergreen server—something that can stay unchanged until Blizzard closes their doors.
---
Not really the angle I was imagining. More so people choosing to follow someone else play the game instead of playing their own game and creating their own story. It’s a peculiar thing that people are spending as much or more time watching someone play than actually playing themselves. 
---
I think you could take it in many different directions
---
I don't think there is a realistic way to keep streamers off a server.
---
Can't have flying mounts and keep with the spirit of classic either.
---
&gt;Do the people wanting to absolutely play on their servers  have a low IQ?
---
They are mostly children, so yeah. I'm not being facetious, either. Streamer fanbases are almost always predominantly highschool age or younger. The era of the streamer and youtuber has created a new kind of celebrity that us 30 year old boomers can't readily grok. It's a celebrity you can talk to. We couldn't just walk up to Brad Pitt or Angelina Jolie or whoever and yell random bullshit at them. But these kids CAN interact with their celebrities. That holds immense appeal to people who are already inclined to fall into celebrity worship or other forms of misguided role-model emulation.   
---
I personally find it distasteful but whatever I bet I do all kinds of shit other people hate.
---
Hi, /u/greenview1, your post has been removed as it is seems to be talking about the current stress test. Please use the current [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bui555/stress_test_2_the_megathread_of_omg_why_can_i_not/) instead.
---
There are PvE servers for a reason, not everything is about PvP. I'm going PvP to have a choice between both, but I'm gonna spend my time between BG's and world pvp, I'm gonna make gold through professions, raid, dungeon, quest to get special items, the game is packed with stuff man.
---
Blizzard has stated that they might break add-ons that try to replicate modern systems or automate core gameplay features.
---
But I don't think that's likely to happen here. At most, they might disable waypoints and such, but the core of the "quest helper" can (and will) be replicated entirely outside the client, with people just looking up quest details on online databases like classicdb.
---
Beyond that, simple quest helpers existed during Vanilla. This is not an automatic pass (e.g. no one-button rotation macros or healbot add-ons), but I don't think Blizzard is going to care that much about quest-helpers. Those of us who dislike them will just have to deal with it.
---
I feel like it's actually the other way around, the more you have without axe spec, then with axe spec instead of 1 sword proc a fight being compared to 1 crit in a fight, its more likely to look like 1 sword proc vs 3-4 crits in a single fight.
---
Only if you trade if for my [Huge Brown Sack]
---
I think the biggest problem with TBC is how they wiped pretty much all of your progress in vanilla.
---
Velcro
---
1-60 you'll be fine - I suggest you to level in arms/fury, you can still tank dungeons just fine as long as you have a shield, and solo leveling will be way faster. But if you strongly prefer prot, don't worry, it can kill things too.
---
Not able to commit a raid schedule may be quite an obstacle for raiding, but even then, some pugs should have tank spots open time to time. Raiding is only a part of the game anyway.
---
PLEASE BAN EVERYTHING I DON’T LIKE, EVEN IF IT DOESN’T AFFECT OTHERS NEGATIVELY.
---
It's just a general overview for now for the good pieces :)
---
I'm just super torn and I'm doing everything I can to help me decide.
---
How the hell would blizz enforce this? If blizz ever decided to put in the TOS that you can't stream/record your game play (whether it is one server or not), gamers would lose their shit. It's not like gaggles of people didn't follow Swifty around. This is Alex Jones type nonsense. Not enough tinfoil in the world exists for this
---
Dunno Ive heard not much in the way of glowing reviews from the high end mythic raiding folks I still keep in touch with.
---
Ive never done it on any difficulty so I cant say personally.
---
Yup that's the price you pay I guess... We knew that already with celebrities being recognized in the street
---
I just don't like Brack. Him successing Morhaim left a really sour taste in my mouth.
---
Thank you!! Il definitely consider a druid healer, since it's my favorite class in current wow as well.
---
One thing I dont see mentioned, and this should apply to any healer, more so in dungeons than raids;
---
Your group does not need to be at 100% health at all times. If a dps takes a hit or two, let them sit at 75% health. The tank is fine at 80% health. 
---
Tying that in with using more efficient heals, and allowing for mana ticks after 5 seconds of not casting, queue up a bigger heal, and cancel if not needed. I'll wait until the tank is closer to 50% health before hitting them with a heal, then go back to cancel casting, allowing for a few more mp5 ticks. This is of course situational, but works well for most trash and quite a few bosses.
---
Reddit should make your posts illegal.
---
Didnt realise sword procs can proc sword procs though thats ridiculous lol.
---
TBC added flying mounts, which was the first and biggest step to taking players out of the world. I wouldn't mind a TBC if they remade it and left out flying mounts.
---
Would not recommend. Warriors are already slow levelers, prot will do about 50% of the damage of Arms/Fury, and the survivability boost from talents will be cancelled out by the fact you're spending twice as long getting hit by every mob. 
---
Probably the slowest and most death-prone possible leveling spec in the game.
---
A lot of "content" isn't actually content that Blizzard makes and this is one of the main reasons people prefer Classic over retail. In Classic content is player driven and organic, stemming from being based in a world that you must survive in and explore. 
---
A lot of that player driven content stems from player interaction through travelling. Just think of the amount of times you ran into players out in the world, taking the ships at Menethil Harbour, running into the opposing faction, etc. Flying Mounts completely destroy this aspect of gameplay. Being able to fly onto some floating island in Nagrand to farm motes isn't worth the amount of content it deletes.
---
What changes is he talking about?
---
I agree to some extent, and have references this in other comments on this thread.  Flying was definitely a negative addition to the game for me, but it certainly didn’t outweigh all the improvements made in TBC.
---
He has ADHD
---
I find this interesting. I played back in vanilla but no pservers never heard of this. Could you explain more? Horde? 2h fury spec and just stance dancing? If this was a thing I would very much enjoy it.
---
i c bajs forsen1
---
Yes, you also can get that sweet maternity leave.
---
I remember how much my friends hated farming as a warrior, because they start with no resources.  Each pull they have to build up rage, instead of starting with a full bar of resources like each other class.
---
why are you on this sub?
---
He streams on twitch under the same name, "Kala". Super chill guy, engages in the chat a lot always answers questions and is very skilled at his class. Definitely my favorite streamer
---
I hope I don't accidentally land on one of these server as I don't know any German streamers.
---
True, but the barriers to even make it to most vanilla raids are longer and filter out a large portion of your average players.
---
Couldn't agree more. Dungeon Finder was the exact point it went downhill.
---
Hell yeah! And it's technically layering. A better form of sharding. From the stress tests it certainly has some rough edges to be smoothed though. 
---
One layer can hold WAY more. And isn't done by zone, but whole region.
---
Ahn'Qiraj mounts going to the streamer cause of their community of sheep servants, economy cause of one very populated side camping for mats or whatever, streamer getting gifts from viewers meaning big advantage in the game, chat spammed all the time, opposite faction being raided all the time with no streamer to group up around, etc. etc.
---
OSRS is the example that IT CAN BE DONE.
---
I think that Blizzard can do it also.
---
&gt;A lot of these console commands were available in vanilla, too. The client had the recommended range of settings, but people could go above or below those with console commands.
---
Yep, and there were addons that basically just extended the amount of options available to you by giving you a GUI for these console commands.
---
Because it's a very long item name. Getting a chain of it going was like starting a copypasta train in twitch chat.
---
Quest addons aren't an issue since it affect only you and it's optionnal.
---
Raid addons are, players won't let you enter the raid without them even if  they crush the remaning difficulty from the Vanilla's raids by showing information that aren't natively show. More assisting tools than comfort. 
---
You won't have choice and this is an issue.
---
That destroys immersion and turns it into a game of running to icons.
---
The city is circular and fairly symmetrical, so it's hard to know at a glance which side you're on. Sometimes you think you're on the flight master side, but it's the mailbox side.
---
Whats the problem with going on a streamer server? I don't enjoy watching people play a game so I never have. Why would them streaming be an issue for players?
---
I’ve made this exact statement in other comments on this thread.  If I could get TBC without flying, it’d probably be the perfect version of WoW for me.
---
That being said, even with flying, I still think TBC is a better version of the game and would still be thrilled to get a chance to play it again.
---
But this is the patch shaman got tranquil air totem. You can have 20% aggro reduction and windfury just by doing the twist my dude!
---
You're gonna find it easier than everyone else to find groups. If you don't plan on raiding prot warr is one of the best things to play.
---
Getting boosted with free gear and unlimited backup is the definition of unfair. Having a horde of people ruins the server. Do you toe suckers think your favorite streamer is going to see your pandering reddit comments hahaha
---
The reason not a lot of people know about that add-on is that it wasn't available for free. I mean, unless you pirated it.
---
Hunter since you'll be able to easily gear up in PvE and then go PvP without having to change your spec. Plus, you'll be able to kite anything.
---
Go ahead and kill a streamer in PvP and see the hate flow in.
---
Go Away Alex
---
- Crushing the enemy faction until they're discouraged from playing there, creating poor balance cause they might not have a "leader"
---
- Ahn'Qiraj mount goes to the streamer on your server. Pretty much certain.
---
- On a bigger scale than a guilder leader, streamers will receive gold and items, getting a huge advantage in pvp or pve, that's minor but still. 
---
- One side camping quest mobs, elites, whatever, if the population is higher cause of the streamer
---
- Others fun things I'm not motivated enough to note
---
Exactly. This is a problem across every MMO. When these games originally launched the leveling experience was part of its core gameplay. Everything was well within the realm of achievable and creating a good and fun experience. 
---
A lot of problems came about when expansions launched, 10 levels were added, and a slew of changes that disrupted the meta. Sometimes they successfully solved problems, other times they drastically hurt the game. 
---
But leveling turned into this hoop that you just jump through every now and then. It doesn't add anything. In lotro, most of the endgame players skip the leveling progress by just farming warg-pens for a few hours. 
---
Leveling just makes the ocean wider, not deeper. It's just another grind to create the illusion that the game is big.
---
TFW nobody mentions Anniefuchsia
---
I guess that makes sense. Thanks for letting me know.
---
I swapped to Alliance back in Mists for a while and that was really weird. Played Horde since 06
---
&gt;Debuffs are really important for vanilla, and suggesting to sneak in a debuff that doesnt help anyone other than rets like myself is the wrong kind of mentality when you are trying to prove to the community that rets are viable
---
I get that, but with 16 debuffs, everyone has more freedom on debuff slots. Again, you can just stop doing it, you are still fine without it, but I never had problems with it in a raiding environment, even when mages switch to ignite.
---
&gt;Lets say, there are 2 furies and 2 rets.  The first flamewalker gloves drop and the raid gives it to a ret.  Everyone has sput on equal effort.  All the furies will be pissed.  Furies will try less because their effort is not rewarded.  Furies leave guild for another that hands out loot more efficiently.  This creates tension early on between players.
---
Retributions can complain the same way in this case if the warriors get the loot. Besides, you have to think: you have 40 people to reward for downing a boss, and bosses don't give loot to everyone. Nobody said your effort is not appreciated, what happened is that the ret got the gear first, that is it. This is literally what happens in bad loot council guilds - people start bitching about the gear. a LOT.
---
&gt; Now if the fury gets the gloves first, nobody bats an eye.
---
This is literally the most bullshit sentence I ever heard. This is ONLY true for hardcore progression guilds. The ret was there, he contributed to defeating the boss, but just because he's a ret, that doesnt mean he doesn't have the privilege of getting gear.
---
&gt; If the fury sees the crusader debuff on the boss, he will question what this ret is really trying to do.  Prove his dps or help his guild?  I wish you the best of luck.
---
Well the furies can be happy because rets supply the best BoM in the entire game, aside the resistance auras that they Will actually benefit from because they are in our range. Besides, I can complain - as a ret - in the same way about Sunder Armor. It only boosts the damage of my white hits, and nothing else. Casters dont gain any benefit. Just because the retri put Crusader on the boss doesnt mean he's a selfish player, especially as a paladin, one of the classes with the most utility in the game. Just because there are some free debuff slots...
---
Most people love to assume that every guild will be the most hardcore communist progression guild, where everything works "perfectly", meanwhile the same group of people who say these things are retail LFR heroes and will not get past Lucifron in Molten Core, last played Vanilla on retail (if they ever played it), or just read up 2 extremely idiotic short and surface level guide about raiding and consider themselves Method players.
---
If you're playing a video game for 8 hours a day managing a pet wont be causing the pain in the ass
---
oh yeah that high-level pvp that is going to be 100% dominated by account sharing. or those tank and spank raids that are easy as shit? and they only got easier with 16 debuff slots instead of 8?
---
honeymoon phase and rose-tinted glasses are expressions for a reason, the "top" classic streamers ran out of content in classic already. do you really think its going to get better?
---
All I can remember about those zones is flying in them. It fundamentally alters how the game is played.
---
&gt;I'm pretty sure it actually reads the combat log "X started casting 'Y spell'" and uses the recorded casting time for that spell and displays it. It isn't perfect though, since it might assume Corruption has a cast time when 99% of the time it will be talented to be instant, and it won't be able to do the difference between 1.0s talented r1 frostbolts and 2.5s talented max rank frostbolts.
---
This right here.
---
In Vanilla you had no way to determine the rank used or how many talents were put into the spell. The combat log would simply state the spell had started casting and that was it. There also were no stopcast event so if the enemy player or mob cancelled their cast the cast bar would still finish.
---
On top of this the game had no way to distinguish between two different mobs of the same type. A level 58 Scarlet Spellbinder casting Frostbolt would make a castbar display on every other level 58 Scarlet Spellbinder near you.
---
You don't want WoW Classic. You want **WoW: My Way**. Utopic.
---
&gt;Classic will be getting expansions.
---
Consider that Classic may never get an expansion literally to stop the need for a second WoW Classic. This is a preservation project, not a "Let's make WoW again, but this time it will be correct!".
---
are they all on follow in a queue?
---
Would rather wear naxx gear than level 58 greens
---
"...I dont play warrior...damage isnt synced with animation well..." How can you possibly make the claim then? On the beta the gameplay is buttery smooth.
---
Then you're bringing the wrong girl.
---
They changed the entire dynamic of dungeoneering and raiding.
---
AoE Paladin tanks and Bears. Removal of 40 men raids. Classes buffed / nerfed because of Arena.
---
Sure, the classes were somewhat "fixed"...at the expense of everything else.
---
You can't just look at one side of the coin, and say "TBC was better".
---
If you look at EVERYTHING, TBC was clearly worse.
---
Video games are not going anywhere.
---
Lots. The nost core is in such a better place since going open source and even then there are still inaccuracies.
---
we as guild will try to dodge them thats the only reason i even know ^^
---
&gt;(e.g. no one-button rotation macros or healbot add-ons),
---
I had both of those in classic. They were patched out eventually.
---
Whats more important, The actual weapon dmg or the DPS for arms warrior pvp? For example:   
---
R14 weapons have (not including other stats):  
---
235-353 weapon damage  
---
77.37 DPS  
---
3.80 attack speed  
---
Ashkandi has (Not including other stats):  
---
229-344 weapon damage  
---
81.86 DPS  
---
3.50 attack speed  
---
Ignoring the other stats on the items. Which one of these is actually better for a warrior? R14 with higher weapon dmg? Or ashkandi with more DPS?
---
It's mostly just there for shits and giggles
---
You will definitely want to make stance dance macros. Some abilities are only usable in specific stances - full list here: https://i.redd.it/ta8x0t7fkty21.png
---
I don't know the syntax because it's been 13 years since I quit, but what you basically want to do is set the macro to cast the stance first then cast the ability. It will save you an action and time.
---
Other useful macros are gear swapping macros such as "cast defensive stance &gt; equip 1 hander &gt; equip shield." This is great for getting rooted in pvp and reducing incoming damage.  Swapping trinkets when out of combat is another good macro to set up since some trinkets give you buff bonuses that persist when the trinket is unequipped.
---
&gt;I was completely alone by the time I hit level cap and suffered

If you're a healing priest, this will not be an issue, you'll be able to find both groups and guilds pretty easily. If you like healing then I say go for it!
---
Plus, if you want to melt faces in PvP, all you have to do is respec to shadow.
---
Chuck Norris is good at stuff.
---
The difficulty is relative, mechanically the newer content is harder, but organising 40 people, with a smaller pool to recruit from, professions needing much more work, gold being harder to get, repair costs being a larger percentage of your gold pool, there's a lot more challenges than moving out of fire.
---
Just don't play man
---
Also how can people having not as much to do at 30 at all relevent?
---
MoP was in the age of transmog, the only reason to be doing those challenge modes. Classic doesn’t have transmog. The rest of your suggestions are just achievements from WotLK.

This sub is pretty toxic towards new players/people asking simple questions, and honestly the content that is upvoted can be...well, quite confusing (and often toxic) to people that dont know much about the game.
---
From what I understand, initially there were no factions, you could gain reputation from any race.
---
While I completely love that idea, I really don't think players will be able to adapt to such a radical change. 
---
Any way they do it, if they do decide to add "new" content to Classic WoW, I would be very curious to see how things develop.
---
Priest respect :P
---
It matters most when you're near your cap.  So if you're level 38 and leveling a brand new weapon, at 1/140, it won't make much difference.  But if you're leveling something that's at 122/140, it will make a huge difference.
---
Write down all the names for hunting at 60
---
Accusing me of being a "hater" only proves that you have no argument.
---
And what you show in the linked video, has **absolutely nothing** to do with the fact that the Beta is currently capped at lvl 30. Huge ingame assemblys like this have happened alot of times over the past 14 years, players doing such stuff is fun, but it's not new.

Come back when you have an actual argument.

Every single class scales earlier than you do. You won’t have the gear or damage to stop anyone that gets the jump on you (which will be everyone).  You will get kited to death. 
---
Warriors early on are just as squishy as every other class so you can literally get killed by a mage or hunter 5 levels lower than you without every getting to hit them. 
---
You just will not have the tools early on to defend yourself. You can’t escape, you can’t chase, you’re just dead in the water. 
---
This is also what contributes to slow warrior leveling because a gank means sure death.
---
It's like I'm actually there.
---
Yep. But one thing they’re good for is attracting new eyeballs to classic wow. Based on the twitch figures. I’d wager that we’ll be seeing a ton of new classic players once August rolls around. For me, the more people interested and playing wow the better, the community feels much more alive when it’s bustling w energy.
---
It still just hurts the real feeling of the world. Like, if you hear the Crossroads is under attack and you head over there from Orgrimmar to defend it, but you find out it's in a different shard and you have to ask general chat if someone can invite you, and you end up getting ignored or trolled. I would just want to log out and not play anymore.
---
The gear reset each expension brings is one of the core problem with retail wow and I don't think it's discussed enough.
---
When TBC launched, I was naive. I didn't like that I was replacing my Naxx gear with greens but I was so happy to have new content that was able to quickly get over it.  
---
When they anounced WoTLK and that it would again reset all our progress I got a huge feeling of emptiness.   The level reset expose the the game for what it is, a giant treadmill.  it cheapens the sense of accomplishment and progression the game offers.
---
In fact, I believe all catch up mechanism will cause this to some degree and that they should be avoided at all cost.
---
This is the reason many people want classic+.   Blizzard is sitting on a mountain of content and assets for WoW but as long as they continue doing expensions in the same way then none of this content is interesting.   The gear resets make the content and our experiences feel cheap and disposable.
---
The prophets to save us all
---
This has been happening since original Vanilla, and it is still happening in BFA... It's very annoying but I've learned to live with it... :) It follows me even when I upgrade computer, change mouse etc.
---
Not everyone plays to be immersed. I just enjoy the power creep and grind. Idgaf why I need to go kill 10 centaurs, I just wanna do it fast and get that sweet sweet blue robe
---
Most raids won't want an Arms warrior, considering how easy it is to find a Fury warrior instead. Dungeons would be fine, except as a warrior you'll have a much easier time just being the tank. Tanking as DPS spec is fine. 
---
The Arms dual wield spec idea is an interesting compromise though. You're really just trading Flurry for Sword Spec, and Bloodthirst for MS. It's definitely a downgrade but might be better than 2h Arms PvE. Only big issue I see is that MS takes up a debuff slot. 
---
Might be OK for casual to mid-level raiding.
---
Questions for tanks.... what are repair costs like?  Specifically what would a repair bill look like at the end of a typical dungeon run? A typical raid as MT or OT?  Let's assume the best case Ontario where there are no wipes.
---
it is not mate

Fuck yeah!
---
I'm looking to play a hunter in Classic, but you just reminded me of some stuff I really liked playing my geared resto druid in vanilla and TBC. Just imagining the enemy getting ready to get that satisfying HK, and then taking it away from them and healing my team mate to 100% in a few seconds.... so great. Hitting my guy at 3% health with the NS max rank Healing Touch..... hnnnngg....
---
That would be 1% of the guilds. Let's make it 5%, or go crazy and make it even 10%. We aren't talking about them here.
---
We are talking about the other 90%.
---
They WILL run worse content than T3...because they will HAVE TO.
---
i would be so proud
---
In the beginning of the following guides is a spreadsheet for race/class combo:  
---
Horde:  [https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-horde-races-and-racial-abilities](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-horde-races-and-racial-abilities)   
---
Alliance:  [https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-alliance-races-and-racial-abilities](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-alliance-races-and-racial-abilities)
---
Raids should be 1-2 bosses each. Weekly raid reset. That's maybe 4-6 items per week. Keeping the gear similar to ZG in that items dropped are both blue and purple. Gear like a shield thats optimal for aoe tanking casters which can then be used in Kara. A wand that adds a dot effect reducing resistances. Some novelty items similar to the orb of deception or dance trinket. The final boss can drop one item for each role that is naxx level or very slightly better or even "off spec" gear for moonkin/feral/ret/etc. Even pvp focused items like the stun trinket or a trinket that adds a chance to disarm your target on hit. This type of gear could be downright required to progress in other raids which would be horizontal in nature.
---
I am not subbed, thus am not even in the beta pool.
---
I know it isn't working. I think I've made that pretty clear, though. I would rather have forced name changes and server merges than broken layering, too.
---
Layering works in other games, and I think that's why they're trying it now. I just don't know that it's appropriate for WoW. It's hard to abuse it in a game like SWTOR where everything respawns so quickly. We can't say the same for sure for WoW where almost everything respawns significantly more slowly in comparison. There's more incentive to layer hop in WoW than in a game where everything respawns in a matter of seconds, not minutes or hours.
---
I think it's a good idea applied to the wrong game. Please don't misunderstand, I don't think it's a great solution. I'm just considering the idea that if they can fix it and it doesn't last past phase 1, that it might be the lesser of two evils is all.
---
Some changes please
---
Vanilla should not be followed by TBC. We went that route already and even tho i like TBC a lot it was the start of a new Wow that is not True to the "core values" as he speakern of in the video. Just my two cents(penniä).
---
https://i.redd.it/9ik7a8e72hv11.jpg
---
&gt;I'll just have to use kitty/bear form the entire time to get anything done
---
Balance is a little trickier, yes, but it's definitely viable for solo leveling.
---
You'll be a spellcaster with stealth who can tank in a pinch if need be.
---
&gt;Also mostly interested in PvE
---
You'll have an easier time getting groups as a healer than a hunter, there's probably gonna be a lot of the latter as it is.
---
by that logic I guess we're also just jealous of all the beachgoers who leave their trash all over the beach because they're rich enough to leave stuff behind
---
Yeah, I believe they were patched out in early BC though. They were the specific examples of things that were possible in Vanilla, but won't be possible in Classic.
---
Blizzard doesn't want add-ons that "play the game for you", but I don't think quest helpers will be considered as such (even if they technically meet the definition.)
---
... and the NPC is going... WTF!
---
No Panda, Worgen or Draeni. No Monks, Deathknights or Demon Hunters.
---
Alliance.
---
Human, Dwarf, Night Elf, Gnome.
---
Paladin only alliance.
---
Horde. 
---
Orc, Undead, Tauren, Troll.
---
Shaman only horde.
---
Classes: Warrior, Rogue, Hunter, Shaman, Druid, Paladin, Priest, Warlock, Mage
---
I knew they wouldn't know why before I buffed them but I figured they realize why afterwards :)
---
It's really hard (surprisingly hard I guess) to choose friends over your faction of heart. It didn't feel right being in the Horde all this time. Hate the themes, don't like the music, hate the starting zones, hate the endgame capitals, like fuck that man. Even WoD Garrison is shit on horde side cause it must be tents and all, it doesn't feel comfy at all. And you're on this snowy zone and not in Shadowmoon, and in BfA you have this SHIT pyramid instead of Boralus, and deserts and swamps as leveling zones instead of the beautiful alliance zones? Fuck Horde. Fuck it will all my heart. That said, you absolutely have fun there, cause if you love it I know what it's gonna feel like to go back, I'm happy for you as well dude!
---
All the classes are needed for classic and I’m sure OP wants to play Priest or Warlock and not Mage or Priest for a reason.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-classes-and-talent-overview#class-race-combinations
---
Pretty much this. If you are afraid of a big streamer check his stream and don’t roll on that server. I have nothing against Asmon or any other big streamers but I don’t want to be on their server so I’m going to make sure my crew picks another server.
---
What happens in 10 years when another generation comes along and cannot experience classic wow because it has been changed over the decade?
---
Video games aren't going anywhere, but livestream services, audience demographics, and particular games are.
---
&gt; Stop being so salty about others success.
---
Oh right, I forgot that this is the sort of reply I should expect. Why even bother trying to have a discussion, lol.
---
All thanks to private servers...
---
Chuck Norris isn't as amazing as he's cracked up to be.  If he was, he would sneak up behind me while I was writing this and smash my face into my keybargaerkgjaerlkhgbealkhea
---
So, how does what I do, that does not affect you in any way, bother you?
---
We pass eachother in game, you have no way of knowing I am using addons. Why PMS about it?
---
It's funny how this is now one of the only videos being spammed about subject.
---
A video in TBC, when they'd mess with hitboxes and you could get temporary bugs like this (arena pathing was notoriously fucked) and now it's being assumed this was the truth for all of vanilla.
---
I remember specifically testing the tauren hitbox, as an undead VS. Tauren (and against another undead) , just like in the video.
---
It wasn't that big. The difference was barely perceptible if it didn't bug out temporarily. It was such a small difference that when people asked if it mattered, all experienced pvpers would say "don't worry about it, it's not much different". That was the advice back then, ecause the difference was nothing like what's seen in the BC video
---
During the stress test people were trading wands for 30 linen cloth wich isnt that jard to get and worth the trade imo
---
Google it dude.
---
Here's a levelling guide I may actually follow :)
---
&gt; Am I going to be able to find groups for dungeons and raids? 
---
If you're casual I doubt people would care, dungeon content is easy in any case. If you really care about dungeon damage spec into IMP Cleave, that + SS is great AoE damage. 
---
Most problems arise from tryhard always-watching-dps-meters guys which don't last very long in pugs and other tank warriors who roll on dps gear.
---
&gt; Also can I be arms talents but with high hit rating gear dual-wielding weapons for PVE? 
---
Don't do that, Arms has 10 talents which enhance 2h, that's your best bet in pve+pvp.
---
That right there sounds like a hunter.
---
Downvoted for the exact reason u/Gulfos gave you.
---
Classic WoW is about RESTORING a game. It's not about making a NEW game.
---
As a warlock I used to give everyone unending breath and detect invis, just in case!
---
"I don't play warrior" Is different from "I  have never tried the melee class called warrior in my life." I have played warrior once on a vanilla pserver and seen enough streams and YouTube videos to know about it. The white hits are always off timed but that's just melee In general.
---
USA checking in. Hey now!
---
The humans history in wow as far as fantasy is concerned is pretty good.
---
Yeah,. theyve talked about this being limited to month 1 of release about a million times.
---
You're 100% right, it'll be a fantastic experience for those new players and I'm glad about that. I just don't wanna deal with the fallout of this hyping process
---
Does this mean you used the search engine, Bing? If so, those search results are meaningless.
---
Everyone knows the true search engine is:

site:reddit.com keywords
---
&gt; They changed the entire dynamic of dungeoneering and raiding. 
---
The comment you're replying too specifically accounted for TBC class balancing, not changes to raids or dungeons.
---
&gt;Classes buffed / nerfed because of Arena. 
---
I don't see this as a bad thing. They managed to buff/nerf stuff based off PvP or PvE and still made them viable in both scenarios.
---
&gt; You can't just look at one side of the coin, and say "TBC was better". 
---
I don't think I did that. I specifically wrote that TBC class balancing was better. And that did not come at the expense of everything else at all. In no way does class balancing suddenly fuck up people getting flying mounts or raids not being 40 man. 
---
&gt; If you look at EVERYTHING, TBC was clearly worse. 
---
Again, again. That doesn't mean we can't learn from class balancing of that expansion.
---
This is too accurate.
---
Thank you! I appreciate you doin the work to dig this back up.
---
Female gnome with that jumping spinning backslash
---
Vertical progression is a major part of what killed the game because all new content renders all old content irrelevant and makes it a hurdle to be overcome. If you do it that way, it's falling into the same trap, and everything else becomes catch-up content whether you have catch-up mechanics or not.
---
Or alliances of gnomes ! It’s 2019
---
Thats a fair point.  I live in Canada but if it turns out to be a large issue ill be playing EU.  Transatlantic ping is more tolerable than legions of trolls.
---
Who? Nobody knows this guy aside from oldies lol
---
&gt;We're already seeing changes to Classic/Vanilla WoW
---
No, we are not.
---
The only thing this tweet confirms, is the cluelessness of the author.
---
In AQ40+ the maces are insane, would horde rogues really forgo that?
---
Because it's been 2 weeks and they are out of content. The game doesn't add that much at 60.
---
And I'm going to play it and have fun, and it's going to be better when they add better expansions after vanilla starts to fade.
---
Just ignoring the problems that vanilla had isn't going to make them go away Mr rose-tinted glasses.
---
I feel you man. I think we're coming from very similar places with the only difference being you started with Vanilla, and I started with TBC.
---
I kinda have to agree with you on the population spread that Outlands brought. I have great memories of the TBC zones (Nagrand is my favorite zone by FAR) but I do agree that it was the start of Azeroth's death in terms of activity. They could probably add a lot of the content from Outlands into Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdoms tho. Thinking about running Black Temple and Sunwell Plateau again and grinding for my T6 get's me real hyped heh. If they could somehow just add some of the other expansions content into Classic but adapting it to the Vanilla game design philosophy it'd be dope. And new stuff would also be really cool too. 
---
And propz on the Hunter, I mained a Hunter from TBC until Cata when they turned mana into focus and I stopped liking it as much.
---
You want the higher weapon damage because of two big factors. 
---
Your instant attacks are your heavy hitters - mortal strike, overpower, whirlwind etc. 
---
These attacks do not care about weapon speed which is what dps is calculated off of. You want those hits to be as big as possible because your uptime on targets is going to be very small. So when you do get in the face or someone you need to clean them up in the few Global’s you’ll have. 
---
This is why the rank 14 weapon is considered better. 
---
Ashkandi is pretty damn close though and arguably easier to obtain
---
All praise to thee
---
Oh I misunderstood the post, my bad!
---
Of course separate.
---
Personally I want at least one permanent Vanilla noChanges progressive server forever. However many servers the community demand wants--they should be there.
---
Blizzard went from 300 to 4300 employees due to wow. They owe the fans and themselves for this game to be memorialized.
---
I want the retail game with its brutally hard mythic raids (especially the top 50 world guys who go in before guides (ya know, real raiding)).
---
Id like a BC Progression server (I have NO interest in doing Wrath again)
---
And finally, Id like a classic+. Id like small measured changes made that work to primarily improve gameplay not primarily to decrease time investment. IE removal of the debuff cap, with retuning of raid bosses, opening up the debuff cap just makes the game more fun for all your dps who didnt get to use abilities for 4 hours a night.  Maybe the first season of classic+ is the debuff thing and gbanks, maybe they fix some glitches/bugs that are in #NoChanges game that were intentionally not removed cause they were there in 2006. Maybe the second season adds class balancing (based on the debuff capless statistics, class output would be totally different--cant make balance changes off OG Vanilla at that point) and new post p6 raids.
---
How is that even possible!?!?!??
---
 I couldn't afford my basic food on 10 hours a week let alone my mortgage, car insurance, car payment, phone bill and daycare for my son.
---
I don't understand how someone can survive on 10 hours a week unless they're making $80/hr.
---
They could easily change up class diversity with some set bonuses. A set purely for balance druids or for ele shamans would draw people into the new raids even if it was not pure stat increases.
---
He also said that he will take free items only to make people mad. I've watched asmon for a few years and I believe he will for sure take people's mats and gold.
---
They're people, and people rarely obey rules they think are inconvenient and unnecessary. 
---
The more important question is *can* Blizzard enforce such a rule? Practically and, in terms of their employment contracts, legally?
---
At any rate... your usename is super honest at least
---
There is no server list, yet
---
Should that server name be branded with a scarlet S on the selection screen?
---
He has a +5 strength mouse
---
Interesting build but you'll have rage starvation issues. Not getting cruelty is a huge no-no for any warrior build since the class is so reliant on crit for rage generation and damage in general. If your goal is pvp prot, try this for a talent tree:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/AyM0cAEwBfzXAB9A
---
You will be a damage sponge and won't do much damage to your opponents, but you will be resistant to stun/charm effects and have 2 stuns available to use. Concussion blow is really good, and revenge stun has no diminishing returns. Shield slam can do some decent damage and dispel magic buffs on opponents but damage is dependent on block value. You're going to have rage issues, so you'll probably want a fast one hander to get as many hits as you can on a target. This build would be more of a support role than a player killer. Stun folks on BG's and let your dps take them down, run flags, and silence casters with improved shield bash. Disarm rogues and warriors with improved disarm. If you're cool with that, this build might work and be entertaining.
---
I haven't played since vanilla and though I've heard this is the case before, horde being massively more popular is so strange to me. Typically, in 2006 servers seemed to somewhat skew Alliance; Horde-dominant servers seemed unusual. The logic back then was that alliance were the classic LotR heroes that people want to play as.
---
I'm just nosing through "db classic" and jotting down gear and where it's from. Requires google, excel, and a little effort. If you don't have excel, pen and paper also work. Last thing I would do is post it on here to have two dozen people criticize it because it's not perfect in their eyes.
---
I was in the original beta in 2004 i think, and they did the same thing. I even think they overdone it. They had Kazzak and others too at the same time. Stormwind and ironforge. It was a bloody mess and super fun
---
There is no benefit whatsoever to leveling as prot.
---
Thanks x2 GenitalJouster.
---
I don't know what you mean, why would warriors skip wwa or BB for a mara staff?
---
Yeah some people talked about that, reporting where they are to stay clear from them! It'll probably happen naturally
---
Old School Runescape (RS version of Classic WoW) has a system in which players vote on what is changed or added to the game. There are poll booths throughout the game in which players can vote on new content. In order for something to be added to the game it requires at least 75% player approval.
---
I can see how it would be annoying for sure, but I'm willing to live with it for a few weeks at launch to handle server load until they remove it and condense the layers back into one.
---
I wonder if the infamous toxic pserver was a fluke because nobody needed healers, every one needed tanks, and it got pretty dull. I really hope classic is different. You’re right, shadow works just would need more SP than +heal I guess
---
Surgeons and Doctors in Hospitals routinely work 12 hour shifts. Some of them actually work 24 hours on-call which means they're in the hospital for 24 hours and sleep when they can in the rooms provided.
---
Warriors are pretty much *the* class that starts off well and just gets stronger and stronger and stronger. This also is reflected in dungeons.
---
You basically equip 5-8% hit, 2hander and rest defensive gear as your windfury procs and incoming damage will grant you 100rage all the time anyways. You dont need 8% hit, because most mobs are level 56-58, therefore you dont need the full 8% hit you need for raidbosses. This leaves you with even more +AP/crit gear.
---
It now depends on how well geared you are and how suicidal pewpew your healer likes it.
---
With some shaman healers I just stayed in berserker stance  in order to not disrupt my rage flow every 10seconds for when whirlwind has to be used for maximum DPS.
---
Threat is no issue, because most times you will be #1 DPS.
---
I did this as early as RFD with Whirlwind Axe and Zul'Farrak with Executioners Cleaver and I did 45% of the groups damage by myself in arms spec with sweeping strikes and cleave/whirlwind/mortal strike.
---
It really gets retarded strong once you have a weapon like Zin'Rokh, BRE, TuF, Ashkandi etc. or just in general a weapon that does about as much damage as you are in levels. Like Whirlwind Axe 35 DPS while you do RFD as level 37 and Cleaver doing ZF with its 41DPS while you are level 44.
---
We did Scholo runs for Dark Runes for our healer, because sometimes 5-8 drop in one run giving him 64 to 80g right there (they sometimes cost 8g+ in AH) and we warriors just wanted fun.
---
So 4 warriors and a resto shaman doing dungeons while talking on discord just enjoying the game hulk smashing.
---
I was the tank so I equipped plate tank/DPS gear while the rest went with leather/mail/plate gear.
---
This is about the gear I did this in  [https://legacyplayers.com/Armory/?charid=350780](https://legacyplayers.com/Armory/?charid=350780).  Just less hit like I used Eye of Hakkar.
---
I mainly did it to help out guildies, because I just genuinely enjoyed doing it.
---
I’m sure he’s sooory , but for serious. More than you can afford. Get your checkbook out. 20-50g a day when raiding.
---
Its not a meme. The guy sucks.
---
Exactly... He is ultra annoying not sure how people watch him.
---
little payo ofc
---
The Blood Elf starting area is by far the best starting area IMO
---
The number of streamers vs how many streamers actually get decent viewer numbers plainly highlights the fact that the main factor drawing people to watch and build a viewership is the streamer's personality. That's something easily transferable across different games, streaming platforms etc. It's very obvious from the tone of your initial post that you have something against streamers.
---
&gt;Math can’t be wrong you doughnut.
---
It can be wrong when fed wrong numbers - and WoW's DPS meters are feeding wrong numbers, which is why you see people having higher DMG dealt but lower DPS in a LOT of cases. Besides that - as a sidenote-, there are mathematical formulas which have a very high chance of being wrong, such as Lanchester's Law for example. If the DPS meters worked well, then it would be true what you are saying: higher DPS = higher damage dealt. What's happening is that the DPS meters dont count time properly.
---
&gt;Did you think I was going to watch every single video you linked so I could convince a 15 year old that math can’t be wrong?
---
I linked one 8 minute video? Where you only need to look up the timestamps that I provided? If you are not going to listen to what I'm saying, then there is no point in having an argument. 
---
Tell me why there are logs of people hitting way above 1k dps in Naxx. Tell me why your DPS doesnt decrease, when all you did is damage the boss for 20 seconds, die and then stay dead for 6 minutes while the boss is being killed. PLEASE TELL ME WHY THAT HAPPENS. I AM CURIOUS. And also, please tell me why the leading mage in the video I linked doesn't even get close to dealing 1k DPS, even with the ignite glitch.
---
&gt;I’m trying to save you from sounding like a moron and going around telling people math wrong.
---
Trust me, I'm trying to do the same thing to you.
---
I knew my way around undercity... but i still felt like i ran the wrong direction every single time and ended up doing a full lap of the damn place.
---
After all... its still 50/50 chance youll take the shorter route. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Cross-faction collusion was easy on Private Servers because there was no restriction of making one character per faction on PvP servers. That, and it wasn't a bannable offence to collude with the other faction. 100% certain my ass. The only way they fucked with their own faction was by having their horde contacts come in and kill them.
---
@shiqznima what is this name reservation you mentioned? We are able to lock in names before the actual launch?
---
&gt; My second complaint is that Resilience splits the playerbase, because now people interested in high end PvP literally do nothing BUT PvP. And organised PvP does not require significant interaction with the rest of the world, unlike raiding.
---
As a PVP main, I much preferred being able to spend the majority of my time just PVP'ing and getting the best gear for my chosen play style over being forced to participate in super time consuming progression raids to gear up.  I'll grant that maybe raiders spent more time in "the rest of the world" farming mats for potions etc.
---
The honor / arena point system that came with TBC was a much welcomed breath of fresh air.  It really sucked in vanilla having to participate in raid progression in order to have good gear to PVP with.  I remember vanilla raiding with my guild fondly (it was still fun) but holy shit was it unhealthily time consuming to both raid and PVP.
---
Resillience was also a barrier against raiders with BiS gear coming into PVP settings and insta-shitting on everyone, even if they weren't as "skilled" as the players who spent the majority of their time in PVP.  So yeah, I'll give a strong endorsement to resillience.
---
They where doing this before the streamer showed up.
---
oh at all? Ok thanks!
---
&gt; Class balance? Sure.
---
In TBC, they did make all classes more useful, but at the same time, they started removing each class weakness, which in hindsight I'm not too big of a fan of.
---
Level as (fury pre ms or) arms until 60 for MS then do your prot stuff. You'll never struggle to tank an instance pre 60 with those specs and leveling is way the fuck better!
---
ENFJ-T And I'm a GM playing a utility class. I'm too predictable
---
Right!?
---
DPS'ng and getting an HK is cool, I guess. But to reach out and heal teammates and not only assist in dozens of HK's, but to literally turn the tide in an outmatched dps war and make the other team run when they see their attacks ineffective is priceless. Seriously, one healer in the mix on your team is a god send. 
---
Not only that, but the opposing team morale drops when they can't kill anyone in that first tussle and they flight instead of fight. Its fantastic.
---
Not everyone blitzed the servers at the same instant, because people actually had to buy the cds and install it manually. 
---
Launch didn't have 2 million people at the same time, it took a while for people to hear about the game. 
---
And there was no reason to login at launch and rush, you didn't have the same amount of sweaty people looking to rush 60 asap
---
I had forgotten about that one. Where in Azeroth is that spell actually useful? Only places I know of offhand is Dire Maul West (for the tunnel leading inside after killing the tree boss) and the buildings near the graveyard at the western end of duskwood (hint: Never go inside those buildings and cast an AoE attack).
---
Yes but in the long run gold is better ;)
---
That is like 2 years away, for most players.
---
We are going to PAY for Classic, and without a continuation, we aren't going to keep paying to replay the same content over and over.
---
We wanted Vanilla...but we actually wanted MORE OF VANILLA after Vanilla.
---
I hope Blizzard see this, and see the shift in the general mentality about TBC and 1.13. We are not missing any point here. Patch 1.13 will require AT LEAST 2 years of development...and Classic, AT MOST, can keep most players engaged for 1.5-2 years.
---
It's ALREADY LATE, but not too late, in asking for a continuation of Classic. And ofc the spirits will run high, since 1.13 and TBC supporters are split like Leavers and Remainers in the UK : almost in half.
---
I was always under the impression that when Blizzard announced Classic in 2017, they were ALREADY developing 1.13, because TBC requires no development whatsoever, and they have to be prepared for both.
---
And I believe that Blizzard is quite far into 1.13 already. It would be stupid not to.
---
I've always thought that it would be cool for *each* zone to have it's own raid or dungeon, having its own unique lore aspects true to the storylines of the zone. 
---
Stonewrought Dam dungeon, for example, would be so cool
---
I made a level 5 Bank Alt with Enchanting.
---
Sent all my Greens to be disenchanted and sold the dust on the AH. Had more than enough at 40 for my mount.
---
If you level your main with Enchanting you get to dust all your blue quest/dungeon rewards too, then when you hit 60 you just drop it for a more useful proffesion.
---
Man this dude is hated everywhere. He has been shit on in the Pantheon subreddit too. lol
---
Can someone summarise this for the people at work?
---
I understand why you're defensive (there was no need for the original comment you responded to), but the entire world has problems. Every country. 
---
Also I'd rate the cold waves as a positive because it's been really hot here in the south this past week. Ha!
---
Why are you so salty against an innocent comment?
---
Yeah that would definitely be a good move. Man I’m way too excited for this.
---
&gt; Consider that Classic may never get an expansion 
---
Hence why I stated my entire wall of text is based on the assumption that it will.
---
&gt;  This is a preservation project, not a "Let's make WoW again, but this time it will be correct!".
---
There are plenty of people (like [Mark Kern](https://clips.twitch.tv/ProductiveResilientSlothWOOP) for instance) talking about post-Naxx content. This is just a theory of how to do it differently than TBClassic, WotlKlassic, Classiclysm, etc.
---
I always had a little thought that could save flying mounts:
---
Flying mounts drop, but they are essentially stored at stables for flight paths. When you use a flight paths, you hop on the selected flying mount of your choice. Nothing else changes, just what you're riding. The flight paths is still automatic. And people in the world can still see you fly by on that mount.
---
Maybe 6-10g, so you'll crack out even if you're lucky.
---
That's embarrassing.
---
Probably got his main account banned from this sub.
---
You guys can have Quin69.
---
Payo is the best! He is hilarious, I can't stop laughing while watching his stream.
---
Assuming half the server transfers (1750 on a presumably full server) then thats 1750*15= 26 grand per streamer server transfer
---
I'd like to be able to take a hit or two while dealing damage back. I would like to be mobile and have ways to not be kited to oblivion. I want to be useful in PvE and PvP Preferably with the same spec.
---
Perfect 5/7 map, great meme sir
---
I remember the first time i went to undercity and got on the lift to go back down. A guy was jumping up and down so I joined him. He stopped, I didn't. My final jump was as the lift went down.....which fell faster than I did. So I died.
---
Its asinine, I didn't even like it when they removed Seal of Kings and other reagents. Buffing people is why I fell in love with my beta pally. My combat rotation is slow af. But ill be damed if any one spends a minute w/o blessing of kings.
---
source? go look at top views on twitch, EVERYONE on top is playing beta lol.
---
Play classic wow. That about sums it up.
---
elemental can do all of that except mana tide, and they can burst people down. so thats why no one plays resto.
---
Delete their memories so its fair game! /s
---
Thanks for writing this. Would be cool to see classic evolve from 1.13. Like Hyjal and new content based on vanilla and vanilla lore.
---
I appreciate your enthusiasm for sarcasm, but to become a master you mustn't use /s.
---
*I'm a human being, and this action was performed manually.*
---
You really are the worst bot.
---
As user Pelt0n once said:
---
&gt; God shut up
---
*I'm a human being too, And this action was performed manually. /s*
---
It went like this: 1,2,3,5,7,11,45,78,98,100!!!!!!
---
Probably very minor shit like the UI differences because it’s not 2004 anymore.
---
They fucked up the first time around and now listen to the playerbase with OSRS.
---
It wasn't that bad.  A good coordinated burst from an arena team would take down any target.  Resillience made insta-gib burst damage harder, but not impossible.  It just required more setup and coordination.
---
He basically just says that flying mounts and the prioritization of raiding as the single endgame goal killed WoW.
---
EQ is a similar but different game.  Each expansion in EQ terms is about the same as a major patch in WoW, with every 3ish EQ expansions being equal to a new WoW expansion.
---
EQ is running a "time-locked progression" model right now, where once a server starts, every 3 months a new expansion is released.  They usually release a new TLP server every year, which means if you **really** enjoy those first few expansions, you can replay them from day one over and over again every year.
---
This year they released two new servers, one being close to a vanilla experience, the second has expansions once a month, and vastly increased exp gain and raid lockouts twice per week.
---
There have/are live(retail) servers with special rules, such as one where all items are tradable, even high end loot gear.  Players have been begging for a TLP server with that rule, and my guess is that's in store for 2020 to lure players back from WoW Classic as half my EQ guild is already planning on moving over and/or splitting their time between the two games.
---
I need to start doing that. Those scrolls don’t sell for much at all so no reason against this.
---
It is hard to summarize all the differences so I will touch on a the ones that stick out to me.
---
1. Immersion - The current expansion (BFA) has a lot more features that make the more convenient but break the immersion.
---
   A. Cross realm grouping and sharding - In BFA choosing a server doesn't matter that much because you can easily group with people from other servers through functions such as LFG, this is convenient and makes finding a group to do a dungeon or raid much easier but has a tendency to destroy the sense of realism and community that classic has.
---
On classic you are stuck with the people on your server. Which gives you a much lower population to do things with but since there are less people you find yourself grouping (or avoiding) with the same people which really gives the game a sense of community.
---
Transitioning to sharding, sharding is basically shared zones that players from all servers share. So in BFA the world is divided into these smaller "shards". If you are in a group with someone they will transition to the same shard as you when you pass the imaginary line between shards. However; say you are running through killing things with a random Hunter and aren't grouped if you cross a shard line you could see him just disappear before your eyes as he is magically shunted off to a different reality.
---
B.  Accessibility - BFA has a lot of functions to make things a lot easier to find and accessable. For example, they put markers on the map for quests, dungeons, and other important functions this makes finding things and doing quests much easier and faster. That item that took you 15+ minutes to find in classic while in BFA you took 30s because you had a small zone on your map to look in and the item glowed.
---
Back to the LFG function for some content in BFA you can click a button can get automatically grouped with people as soon as the roles are filled you are then teleported to the start of the dungeon or raid and when you are done teleported back to where you left off in the world. Even for the higher content you can scroll through groups in LFG and apply to join the group but then you have to travel to the location or have two party members summon you with the stone right outside the dungeon or raid. 
---
Classic does not have these functions and finding a group and getting to the location takes a lot more time.
---
2. Leveling - In BFA it takes significantly less time to level from 1-120 then from 1-60 in classic. They also added in a bunch of ways to make leveling easier for alts such as heirloom items and such.
---
3. Dungeons and Raids - In BFA each dungeon and raid has multiple levels of difficulty allowing even the most casual of players a chance to see all the content. Classic has one difficulty for each dungeon or raid. BFA has a lot more mechanics for fights than Classic does one player said that the high Tinker fight in BoD has more mechanics then the Molton Core raid does in its entirety. I'm not saying classic has easier bosses just simpler in terms of things you have to do to avoid dying.
---
4. Class balancing - BFA balances their classes a lot better. Sure certain tanks might be better than others but they are a lot closer in viability than in Classic when you head only one class that could tank.
---
5. Warforging and Titanforging - In BFA all gear has a chance to War or Titanforged basically increasing its base stats. This process is random and imo frustrating. Say that in a Mythic level raid (highest difficulty) you kill a boss and get a 415 (higher ilvl = better) version of a pair of gloves then you go and decide to help your friend with the heroic level (a step down in difficulty) of the same boss when you kill that boss the same gloves drop again but this time they titanforge to a 425 version instead of the normal 400 version of the gear. In classic the gear doesn't change and will always drop at the same level for the boss. No random chance other than getting it to drop.
---
Summary: BFA has more ease of use and Classic has a better sense of realism and community.
---
There are a lot more changes but I'm on mobile dealing with an active 1 year old so I'll just leave it at this. Hope you find it helpful.
---
I did say. "Dungeon finder was okay in tbc because all of the dungeons it had were made before dungeon finder so it didn't compromise their quality." I just mentioned it because of where it led.
---
Yeah, I haven't put much thought into the NElf one.
---
My initial guess is that it'd be just like the Gnome one, just with 15-20 minute prep to get to Kharanos, and essentially start the Gnome version from there... But without setting hearth at Kharanos, taking the tram both ways? Then hearthing to Dolanaar to save time later?
---
Sometimes you end up questing beside the opposite faction, while being non-hostile. Whenever I play as a mage I love to sheep them to regen their health, the ultimate reverse gank
---
Up voted for "alliance scum"
---
The world was by all measurable ways physically smaller as (except for cataclysm) they have only added to the zones. You do point out correctly that the relevant part of the world became ever smaller, which is what the paragraph you're commenting on was suggesting to prevent.  
---
Also saying that the zones in the early expansions had the same themes and colors is just incorrect.
---
I'd disagree, I think it's definitely enforceable. Have a handful of "Black" servers where publicly sharing images of gameplay is a bannable offence. If you choose to play on a Black realm, you are making an active choice to not create community content. And the beautiful thing is that the more egregiously someone violates this rule, the easier it is to notice and ban them!
---
Whether or not it's actually a good idea is an entirely different matter. I think you would need the TOS to have significant downsides playing on such a server, to avoid people flooding towards it. Hence the total blackout, rather than just blocking livestreams and video content.
---
Overall, I think it would create too much of a divide in the community. So oh well, the streamer is more likely to get Scarab Lord, but let's be honest, you were almost certainly never going to get it anyway.
---
It's kind of fun to participate in the shit streamers do IMO. Lot of shaming towards people who enjoy this stuff which I really don't get.
---
Nah see the brilliant thing about Vanilla was not skipping was built in. 
---
MC never lost its value, ZG never lost its value, BWL stayed a relevant raid for the entire content cycle. 
---
When 2 pieces of loot drop per boss, some of them garbage, it takes forever to gear out your raid. 
---
Further, even to a full t3 guild, mc gives TF, ZG enchants, BWL has a strong off pieces that can complement the limited loot youre getting out of AQ and Naxx. 
---
The seasonal release of content on live immediately makes previous tiers irrelevant. Not the case in classic. Without MC gear, BWL is a lot harder. Without nearly a full t2.5 raid, naxx is impossible. Certain bosses in naxx are impossible until youve been in there long enough to get 8 warriors 3/9. 
---
Anyone who plays a Classic+ is there for the endgame. so hitting cap would be a big focus anyone who rolled there, the 1-60 game is full of content, and I cant think of a time during the leveling run where im thinking "Sure feels like a content drought right now".
---
A decent casual pace to reach max level would be 10 days played, so like 240 hours. Though if it's your first time through it may take longer depending on how much help you give yourself by following guides or using a questing addon and what not.
---
Its great to hear that! we all could use a nice post like this. :)
---
The chat banter was top notch too. You actually had fun. Too many pussies get offended nowadays.
---
I've noticed a pretty interesting trend on this subreddit over the last couple of months. A huge part of the most idiotic comments are from relatively new accounts with low karma count. Not sure what sort of conclusion we can draw from that, but here we are.
---
I can get down with all the races in the game, I was just saying from “traditional” aesthetics Draeni are more feminine and pretty.
---
It’s fine how it is, and if not a single change is made I’ll be happy. I’d be even happier with Dual Spec and Guild Banks, though.
---
Casually you're looking at 240-270 (10-12 days) hours /played to be max level. Unless you're some kind of leveling savant. A 60 ding around 6 days /played is considered pretty quick.
---
Classic WoW is an experience not to be missed, in my opinion. It is the best version of the game in my opinion.
---
Yeah the map i was referencing didnt have instances in Gilneas, CoT or Ulduar. it was from 2001. Though the gilnean peninsular and the Quel Danas lands were on the map.
---
There was a 1999 map with Ulduar, Northrend, Tomb of Sargeras and other spots on it and didnt show up in wow for years after 2004.
---
Wow, you make a really solid arguement here with many valid points
---
One word. DOTs. And this is coming from a guy that played a mage all the way to wrath.
---
Many are going PvP and are going to try and roll on the same server.  It will be interesting to see if they can strike a balance between horde and alliance streamers.
---
I don’t have a clue but a site using the Blizzard API and has been around for a decade supported by them is, questionable, okay.
---
You could also look at the previous date but I know you won’t because that won’t follow your narrative, regardless, us NA players may have streamers but we won’t have the top guilds in the world ruining our experience, so eh, it doesn’t really matter does it.
---
Yeh or they can just release BC as a stand-alone game is be happier with that than having changes made to classic.
---
&gt;My first complaint is that Resilience makes no sense narratively. It's  bad for immersion, because it reveals the artificial nature of the game  world, acknowledging that players and NPCs are substantially different.  Why does this armour protect you a lot from one guy's frostbolt, but not  that other guy's? There's no in-setting reason.
---
I don't see how can a stat affect immersion in any way, it doesn't even affect your gameplay, it only affects your gear but I don't see how choosing different items based on their stats breaks immersion. Of course players and NPCs are different, you don't have the same parry chance against a raid boss or a player due to their different level but that doesn't break immersion at all, it's even better (and I'm sure you don't know this but in PvP there is a 1% miss rate that can't be reduced by hit rating, so every players are different from NPC, resilience or not). Actually resilience is effective against both players and NPCs, that's why tank druids take S3/4 head, because due to the resilience it's a BiS pre-SW.
---
&gt;My second complaint is that Resilience splits the playerbase, because  now people interested in high end PvP literally do nothing BUT PvP. And  organised PvP does not require significant interaction with the rest of  the world, unlike raiding.
---
That's just wrong, high-end PvP players are looking for some PvE gear (except some specs like SPs who need as much resilience as possible to tank) from SW nor BT / HS, therefore they're forced to do PvE if they want to have a competitive gear. Plus I don't see why it would be bad that PvP doesn't require significant interaction with the rest of the world, if someone doesn't want to interact with players why would you force him to do so?
---
&gt;My third complaint is that Resilience (and developer dependence on it)  actually limits player choice, basically forcing PvPers into a single  stream of linear gear improvements, rather than having a cool mix of  weird sidegrades and such from all over the game. This also kinda plays  into the fun of weird itemisation, rather than having all gear be  strictly optimised for specific purposes, since optimal stat ratios and  such are different between PvP and different raids. And even more  importantly for PvP, it limited the ability of the meta to self-adjust  in response to dominant trends. Without resilience, you get people  alternating between differently statted pieces of gear to account for  meta trends (e.g. stack shadow resistance to counteract a surge in  Warlocks, stack stamina to counteract burst/combo builds, etc.) With it,  the solution is always "stack Resilience or die."
---
I could say the same thing about Legion / BfA, there are no difference between PvP and PvE gear so it limits a lot more player's choice as you have no choice at all. With resilience, depending of your class / spec, you can choose to go full resilience, or take a couple of good PvE pieces to get more damage / healing even if you miss some resilience, it doesn't limit player choice at all, it's the opposite. Let me tell you that if you're going arena with 3 shadow resistance gear which only give stam / intell and shadow resistance, you're gonna have a really bad time if you meet anything else other than warlock / SP.
---
Imo that's a lot better than what they do now to balance PvP and PvE, now you have PvP modifiers to increase / decrease damage / heal for almost every spell that players are not even aware of because they're not shown in the tooltip, thanks but I'll stick with resilience.
---
There is no armour specialisation in classic. If you're a Holy Paladin, or a Resto Shaman, you will be rolling on cloth gear as it will be best in slot for healing. Likewise if you're a Fury Warrior you will be rolling on some leather and mail gear because it will be best in slot.
---
Countdown to Classic - Great PodCast
---
FuriousPaul - Is actually Joanna, from the world record 1-60, 
---
Frostradomus classic grinder, and shows you where to get those golds!
---
Maybe offer a speed boost for rare flying mounts, etc.
---
The actual macro I used was based upon that, but wasn't that entirely. It also detected when I had no target, or if my target was hostile. If that was the situation, it would cast maximum rank PW:Fort on myself. As the macro currently is, you have to target yourself to get PW:Fort on yourself. The modification should be easy enough to do.
---
And just had a strange idea about that macro. It's fairly obvious that it can be modified for any buff with multiple ranks such as arcane intellect (but you would have to research the levels needed for each rank). My idea would be to modify the macro for making food and water. In a nutshell, if you have no target, it creates the maximum rank food or water that you know. And if you do have a friendly target, it creates the maximum rank food or water that the target is capable of using. Fairly simple modification and making giving out food and water for a mage much easier.
---
good rebuttal homie, really showed me that i was wrong.
---
rose-tinted glasses and honeymoon phase, the sooner you realize that classic is going to be a contentless game the faster you can move on.
---
&gt; Maybe we shouldn't even have a Shattrath.
---
Imagine how desolate and treacherous Outland would feel in comparison if it completely lacked any major hub like this, especially with other mechanics limiting travel such as there not being any flying mounts.
---
If the whole expansion was horizontal it'd actually feel like an *expansion*, since it woulddn't replace the old world and would be its own harsh new world with its own incentives to bring people there.
---
Crendor is ways a giggle.
---
Thanks dude. Yeah I would say ashkandi actually is a bit easier to get a hold of. If your lucky enough to have a good guild.
---
uh pretty sure addons were very much a thing in vanilla.
---
I feel 95% of the shit in this reddit can be avoided with this one phrase.
---
"Don't Yuck Someone Else's Yum"
---
Love it, it only lacks
---
Jeremiah Payson
---
This is true! I had forgotten about the tranquil air totem.
---
&gt; Also, this is reddit ... an online (mostly anonymous) message board, which probably also attracts more introverted people.
---
You're saying introverted people are more likely to use social media?
---
From the comments the "problem" seems to come from 2 places, they love Vanilla and only want to do Vanilla content (like people can play thousands of hours of Skryim) or they see any progress as a slippery slope to stray too far from Classic WoW. 
---
Private Vanilla servers have been running for years and are quite popular, so maybe they are onto something.
---
I don't care for the Vanilla content, I want an MMO that is slower and has more RPG elements. So far only Classic WoW has managed that, so I want more of that.

Stigmatizing mental health brings negativity to many affected with it. I hope in the future you can use words that aren’t hurtful to others, many times people don’t feel comfortable speaking out but language does have an impact on people that is very real.
---
Hope so, worst capital city by far.
---
The issue is often that old players no longer interact with the low level zones. Yeah, you see high level characters in ironforge, but the actual world tends to get pretty empty once servers progress enough. If there are 95% level 60s and 5% level 1-59. the Max level areas are crowded but the low level areas are empty.
---
I really hope so. The "hardcore" MMO market nowadays is criminally underserved.
---
I will say dont worry about max level so much
---
the "just to reach max lvl"  attitude is not the right one for classic as the game starts at lvl one not at endgame
---
That just sounds like PvP gear needed to be buffed. The whole system of "PvP gear is shit for raiding, raiding gear is shit for PvP" infuriated me to no end. Let them be more or less equal, but PvP gear is more optimised for PvP (stamina, resistances) and raid gear is more optimised for raiding (hit chance, high DPS, low survivability).
---
And perhaps a handful of pieces from either side are BiS for the other, so that the best gear requires you to play both halves of the end-game.
---
There were so many better ways to go about this than just cutting the community in two.
---
Unless you're on a B server or a P server.
---
Your better off picking a class you like for it's toolkit, and then finding a guild that will fit you in, rather than picking a class you like less for so that more guilds will desire you for raids.  A well played class backed by a friendly player, can almost always find a raid spot.
---
I believe it basically goes something like this.
---
Basically, Druids are least represented in raids.
---
Warlocks and Hunters were more common. (hunters more common in early raid tiers then lower in high raids, warlocks less represented in lower raid tiers and more represented in late raid tiers)
---
Then SHamans or Palladins.
---
Then Priests
---
Then Mages and Rogues
---
Then Warriors are the most common.
---
However all of this goes out the window, when you start dealing with your guilds raid team.   The guild works with what it has, so you might be a in raid with a dozen or more hunters, 1 warlock, or 9.
---
I loved my Hunter, can't wait to go back to that vanilla feel! I totally see where you're coming from with the love for TBC, I really enjoyed Sunwell and the island content kept people in one place meaning PvP was on the menu again. It was just hit and miss with the world not feeling whole. Like you said, if they can bring TBC and that part of the game to Classic in the future in a Runescape like enviroment, man that's a wild ride I'd be interested in.
---
ENFJ, running a guild as a utility class. Checks out here.
---
Something tells me this is a private server screenshot
---
Only one? They are all fat.
---
He is trolling....holy shit boys
---
A good way to sweep right into WoW2. Just an alternate route still beginning from original classic wow and learning from alllll of their mistakes
---
I'm not even going to be playing Alliance and I plan on checking out Loch Modan. They really messed it up in Cataclysm.
---
Yeah me too, luckily due early December. I’ll get a few months of classic in, hopefully hit 60 with before the kiddo!
---
He is also admits that there are things he doesn't know, or remember .. it seems like a lot of "experts" have come out of the woods recently
---
Backstab was not working correctly, i.e. saying you must be behind the target when you are clearly behind it and facing it, as well as BS from the front (this could be a spell batching thing, BS at right time then mob turns around before batch clears)
---
The average Classic player after the looky Lou’s leave will be over 30 I bet. Our guild of RL friends are all married with kids. Casual guilds will be out there for sure. We only plan on one raid day a week.
---
I've noticed that too.
---
It's not uncommon on reddit in general to create throwaway accounts just to troll, it's increasing here lately.
---
For the horde
---
Don't worry, I wasn't taking it personnally though, I thought this was banter  ! Haha in the south it comes as a positive I'm sure! It's true, every country has problems, here as for many countries it's the stupid politics :/
---
If you dont take thrash blade somethings wrong
---
I agree. The dungeon finder was the turning point. I remember how empty the game felt right after it hit. The effect was immediate.

Personally mostly questing and vendoring anything I could. I did a bit of selling on the AH there and there but wasn't exactly massively successful, no real need or desire to corner the market and others are just better at the finance stuff. Also one time got paid 10g to help someone create a guild. So I got that going for me. 
---
Also I knew a few wealthy players who occasionally helped out. A good guild really was priceless back in the day.
---
M'leeway
---
Snutzy
---
Yep, he's very down to earth which is what makes him better to watch.  He doesn't pretend to be some expert, he's honest.
---
Yup,  that's the only start I went through for my characters. Else I'd make DK's to avoid starting early, a DH later on, used some boosts from the Xpacs... I mean, since I'm horde I couldn't level up anymore... Just didn't enjoy it on the horde side
---
I feel your pain dude, same boat for me. Gonna main a paladin though, and I've gotten myself sufficiently excited for that. On the bright side I literally know nothing about the alliance experience, so it will be a ton of new fresh content.
---
here are more vanilla pictures:

Definitely what I was referring to. Sometimes you're already in stride and don't both to look at the map/radar.
---
Why wouldn't she have? They were both on a path of vengeance, calling upon ethical questionable forbidden powers, outcasts searching for a new home.
---
Wouldn't it have made sense for Kael, Vashj, Akama and Sylvanas to have established a new faction together.
---
For dungeons I'm thinking between 1.5 - 3g depending on deaths or not. This is at not-all Tier level gear.
---
As gear improves, if your DPS in your group hasn't improved much, then expect the number on the higher end. If you just obliterate the poor dungeon then its a bit less.
---
Just vendoring grey trash will keep you in the net positives though. So loot everything.
---
&gt; even if doing PvE in PvP gear is not very optimal
---
That's way underselling it.  Raiding in full PVP gear was straight up not an option if you hoped to progress.  You needed all that sweet sweet +hit% gear that didn't come from honor rewards.
---
Sounds like you "loathed" it because your dragonslaying PvE experience and gear didn't make you a god on the PvP battlefield.
---
You still get plenty of language based guilds etc like hun/swe etc on english servers.
---
But, I wouldn't say you'll really notice it in a detrimental way either - since english is by far the prevalent language.
---
I'm more inclined to believe it's just a throwaway account recently created to troll.
---
To each their own. I love and will miss hanging out in UnderCity. I hate Stormwind lol
---
So is layering just initially for server load? Layering isn't staying the whole time is it?
---
&gt; It's just a general overview for now for the good pieces :) 
---
It would be easier to just look up some pre-bis/bis lists for the different phases
---
I almost cried. Take my up arrow
---
Best part was right after he was summoned!

---
Ermm...everything?
---
It's either 20 or 40. The 25 men raids in TBC were DESIGNED to replace the 40 men raids. And by doing that, they fragmented the guilds...because was what the point in having 45-50 raiders, when only 25 were needed?
---
So, yeah, 25 men raids can't be in Classic, without drastically re-design the content AND Classes.
---
20 or 40, with 40 men raid being the only raids having the best gear drops.
---
Yeh their sub count grew during TBC
---
y’all are really exaggerating this whole streamer thing
---
These are just ideas for when progression is done. So from then on more ways of implementing are on the table. Like dying your gear. R10 warrior gear is very distinct from R13 gear. Might as well be able to die the defilers tabard blood red or give it a greyish or brownish hue.
---
Everything's possbile like it is in OSRS with voting once the server is fully progressed and the game is basically done.
---
Imagination station.
---
Based on stuff in The WoW diary, it certainly seems that way. 
---
I seems to me they initially had 2 types of content, non instanced micro dungeons and the bigger full instanced dungeons. 
---
For instance, Yeti Caves, Jeadenar, Nethergarde Mine, Gold Mines, Barrow Dens, Tyrs Hand, Hearthglen, etc. were all outdoor non instanced dungeons. 
---
John Staats, the guy who made 1/2 of it, referred to them as "micros". 
---
Then youve got full on instanced zones. 
---
Nearly every zone has a micro or a instance. 
---
Thousand Needles and Darkshore and Azshara (cant remember if there is a Barrow Den here or not) are the only ones i can think of off the top of my head without an instance, an elite area or a unique cave system.
---
Dude dont be so special needs about it
---
I KNOW that was and still remains my favorite zone. I spent literal days farming there for Fel Cloth because I loved the Autumn look and pretty little sparkles that would sometimes fall.
---
Who is this dude?
---
I can't understand WHY people watch this guy, seriously the most punchable streamer I've witnessed.
---
&gt;MEN HAVE INVENTED VARIOUS NAMES in which to measure distance, and have taken a certain pleasure in assigning units of one to the other, in the sense that it is so many inches to the span and so many spans to the league; or in converting one to the other, in the sense that a league in the Sorannah is almost two leagues within the ancient confines of Seawall, that is, within the barony that once held the city of Dragaera, and, at the time of which we have the honor to write, still held a portion of it; yet, for all of this measurement, it is understood by those who travel and by those who listen to travelers that the meaningful unit by which distance can be measured is time.
---

---
Thanks, haven't played classic yet. So my warrior from legion has always leveled as prot
---
Thwarting an opposite factions world boss attempt so your own guild/faction could have a chance would be in the nature of the game. If blizz protects streamers in this regard I can see it causing more issues than anything. Why not just hand them everything? Also in my years of playing the game through vanilla TBC wrath etc I have never heard of PVP resulting in bans. I remember a few blue posts back in the day saying if you do not like ganking to roll PVE. I've shut down TM area for an entire evening before back in the day. Why would they ban players? Isn't this part of the reason we want classic back?
---
They have spent countless hours on all of those models and everything. This is an awesome way to recycle those. 
---
To add to that, maybe even add exclusive flight paths for like a reputation mount that you buy. But not too many where you never have to run anywhere.
---
I just love the irony of calling Soda cringe and then in the same breath fanboying XQC who is one of the most cringiest streamers ever.
---
They will bring something like 4 warlocks + 2 hunters and a shadow priest as well
---
Yeah, that's unfortunate. I'm not sure how you get around that, though. Even if low level content is released, you might have some 60s stop by to check it out, but I doubt they would stay very long. A lot of people just have their main character and aren't into alts.
---
I was alliance too and always loved seeing shaman stuff
---
and desperately tried to hold their attention whenever they got bored by screaming stuff like "WOAH WHATS THAT?" or "DUDE LOOK AT THIS"? yeah, fuck that kid.
---
i dont really have anything to answer but it feels relevant enough for me to say 
---
does anyone else watch asmongold even though you hate him? i dont like him, his fanbase, and basically every opinion he has wow related or otherwise but i cant stop watching 
---
part of me feels like this is why people love watching shit like Steve Wilkos or Extreme Cheapskates/My Strange Addiction.. but idk 
---
another part of me does like that he doesnt pretend to be holier than thou like most streamers, hes a disgusting selfish cretin and hes proud of it, but the last part of me wonders why that even appeals to me? idk this got rambly
---
An eventual server ruleset that progresses through WotLK that axes Dungeon Finder but keeps Ulduar and ICC formal raiding intact would be a dream.
---
WoW classic is closer to TES single player games then ESO is imo.
---
Thank you for your help. 😁
---
Learning by hard knocks. Everyone gets elevatored by the Undercity.
---
Please stop giving this chump attention. He is just a cry baby with nothing positive to say ever. Makes Az from healvsbabyface look like a fan boi shill.
---
I want to go for world dragons/scarab lord ETC. Do not think it will be possible with asmon being in a realm and 1000+ players donating everything to him.
---
T8 was the best raid of all time (Ulduar) and T9 was the worst of all time IMO (Coliseum) plus RDF.  That was the beginning of the downward spiral, honestly.
---
Then they merge servers, which in the process can balance faction ratios. There's going to be a split in the playerbase anyway as people who want to play BC go on private servers. Or if they just update classic into classic BC then some people will bounce back to classic servers. The only way around this is if they add the NPC to stop level gains at 60 but that kinda ruins PvP servers, and any subsequent patches that tweak spells would have to not apply to 60 twinks...it would be weird. 
---
At the end of the day BC had more robust PvE environment and introduced arenas, in terms of longevity of content I think there's more there.
---
No, I am not saying that at all because, I would not equate reddit to "traditional" social media like facebook, instagram or twitter. That's why I called it "message board" and added that it's mostly anonymous.
---
So taking all this into account, I am saying that introverted people are more likely to use message boards than extroverts. I could be wrong of course
---
Isn't the watermark only if you had the free version?
---
&gt;  Its true that is a lot more inmersive to have just gear, not “kind of” gear.
---
That's so boring.  Why would you want only straight linear gear upgrades instead of things that were situational?  Should resistences have not been a part of the game?  You really think the game was worse for having fire resist shine in MC or BWL vs nature resist shining in AQ or cold resist shining in Naxx?
---
Yes exactly! And we see videos pop up here on the subreddit of phasing where the person wasn’t even changing groups, and it’s obviously not intended and clearly one of the main reasons there is a beta going on; to work out those kinks in the system and get it functioning as intended. 
---
I’m glad there is tons of bugs and malfunctions now and that they get corrected, rather than later during launch.
---
True this is easibly googleable and should be removed
---
Also, arguably the largest WoW streamer of them all is Asmongold and he’s alliance. I was playing horse side but watching his stream, and the masses always flocked to where he was. Having 55k-65k consistent viewers when he streamed the stress test and certainly many were in the stress test following and playing with him.
---
any serious PVPer who mains alliance and warrior should be a gnome. For this reason, AND escape artist.
---
^ This. Otherwise, considering flight paths are essentially non-interactive, I would see no benefit at all acquiring any type of flying mount.
---
Now if buying flight training unlocked different restricted flight paths in the world such as the Skettis or Ogri'la questhubs (and possibly removed or lowered gold cost at flight stations) then I can see benefit from the system.
---
I’m going deep feral for lvling then switching to Hotw closer to max to get into the swing of wpvp with it and then eventually when bgs comes out I’ll be going to more resto for FC in WSG and heal in raids
---
Of course man!! If anything changes let me know!
---
Who is this clown anyway? I am seeing the name for the first time.
---
You can just feel the ", mother fucker" after the "Buff me".
---
I cant watch the clip cause im at work, but needing to be dead to enter the raid zone seems like a clever way to curtail obsessive amounts of buffs. 
---
Would be cool if to get in you have to die in moonglade and talk to cenarius or something.
---
It could the Queen of All Gaming Ever talking about it - it's still a deviation of the purpose of WoW Classic. And a risky one, because you think that the many devs and community would actually agree on a perfect update philosophy. In reality, if they introduce *one extra dungeon*, they would heavily modify the flow of players in the content.
---
 [https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/wowclassic](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/wowclassic) 
---
&gt;World of Warcraft Classic is a faithful recreation of the original World of Warcraft—it runs a bit smoother on today’s computers, but the game still looks and feels like you’re playing World of Warcraft from 2006. Combat mechanics, original character models and skill trees all contribute to a truly authentic experience, as do your interactions with other players. Your reliance on others to take on the world was at the heart of the original WoW and is at the heart of World of Warcraft Classic. 
---
If you expand or modify it, it stops being Classic. It becomes Classic+ or whatever. You gotta remember it's still a game.
---
He didn't get banned for this and neither did asmongold when he went under stormwind.
---
Apparently you don't know what a beta is for either.
---
&gt; is sword spec more damage than critting 3-4 times in a row?
---
You can't really put it like that. It's not like axe spec *will* cause you to crit 3-4 times in a row and swords never crit. 5% crit is 5% crit, it's pretty straight-forward. It's one more crit every 20th swing.
---
A sword spec proc is funcationally similar to a crit in terms of damage dealt, but you could still crit on both the original and the procced attack without that extra 5%, and the sword proc will generate rage like any auto-attack. This basically means that one sword spec proc is better than one crit, and both talents give the same chance for their respective outcome to occur.
---
Sword spec is both better DPS on a fundamental mathematical level and stronger for PvP because it basically doubles the highest potential damage you can do with an attack. Instead of the highest being a crit, the highest becomes a crit plus a free attack that also crits. When that happens, you pretty much just kill the target.
---
I was a Warlock main in vanilla and am thinking of doing rolling warrior. What's the best overall Warrior race for both factions?
---
I mean, if nobody’s saying anything then people just keep on using hurtful language. But you’re right. I should have given a better explication when I replied instead of getting upset, which doesn’t actually teach anyone anything about the impacts words can have on people. 
---
But it was hurtful. I’m just hoping people can learn and grow and be inclusive of all people. 
---
Do you (or anyone) have any suggestions on how to be educational without being confrontational? I would love to hear them.
---
I mean I think Soda has been cringe ever since he got huge. I watched XQC on Overwatch when he had less than 200 viewers and enjoyed him. Both are now pretty cringe but I still could easily watch and OW stream on XQC over anything Soda. That entire crowd of streamers is mad annoying though. Greek/Soda/T1 etc
---
Is there an enchanting level requirement to de higher level gear?
---
&gt; Seeing how much hype the beta gets makes you wonder if they could attract the same amount of people or even half of this amount on a BFA stress test before it came out...
---
The hype is absolutely there, but whether or not people will actually like it enough to stay for several months or even years is hard to gauge right now. All I'm saying. I hope we kill retail and get classic content updates in the spirit of classic wow. I just don't think that stress test screenshots are proof that it is happening. And I'm obviously not alone. 
---
I'll be there.
---
Yes, then no.
---
If you don't get into classic wow for a long time and then join, you'll still be able to experience all the raids. As every raid tier is useful somehow. Classic is coming out days before my deployment, I'll be joining about 8 months late, so I guess the perk to being late to the game is you have less competition to get mobs, nodes, ect. The economy is normalized, and there will be t2-3 raids your guild does on the regular, and will be able to drag you through for easy and fast gear. Provided a high end guild recruits you. But a t3 raid team will be able to faceroll through t1-2 content to get you caught up quick. So there is no real worry on being behind the curve. Once youre 60, you're at the curve.
---
Yes the internet can be a cruel place apparently. I’ll put the work in thanks anyways!
---
the real nostalgia experience\*   
---
only for those who want to relive the past instead of playing a game you cant play anymore.
---
They said they will remove it, but let's see what happens.
---
Quest helpers don't "technically" play the game for you, they don't automate anything.
---
If Blizzard didn't want them they would have break them like they did with other functions considered too powerful, they instead integrated one into the client (I think during Cata), so I very much doubt they won't allow people to use quest helpers on Classic.
---
ah yes, bald man bad
---
how could I forget
---
REEEEEEEEEEE
---
I'm a little bit behind you. Our due date is December 31st - Jan 5th. =). Probably right when P3 hits. 
---
Congrats though man =)
---
You can keep the yetis. Mid 30s there is a goldmine grind spot for skinning vendor grays and herbs. Keeping it secret since already to many know about it lol.
---
Child's play.  There was a rogue in my guild who was intentionally chain BoP'd to lower their DPS.  That rogue was me...
---
Ion said layering will be removed by the start of phase 2 at the latest. We're all hoping for much sooner than that, as it is designed just to remove the initial load from the first few starter zones
---
Originally posted to r/mechanicalkeyboards by u/fizzgiggity but wouldn't let me cross post for some bizarre reason
---
Here's the comment, officers
---
Dude there will be hundreds of servers on classic, it’s not like there is going to be 2 servers total to choose from at launch. 
---
There will be WAY more than just one server with no streamers on it
---
No joke
---
Like he knows what’s “Best” for us or “Knows” what we want 
---
He thinks he does , but he doesn’t...
---
When people say that classic wasn't hard it is really telling of what they imagine the game will be like. In retail you can hit max level in an extremely short time and the only real content is endgame raiding and pvp. Comparing the first raid of BFA(no idea what it is) to MC, you could easily say that MC is easier. There were almost no difficult mechanics and most bosses were tank'n'spank.
---
 What these people don't understand is that classic isn't just a mad dash to 60 to start raiding. The leveling process and dungeons on the way to 60 are just as much interesting content than the raids. These are actually much much more difficult than retail. In retail you could be zoned out and easily complete any dungeon via group finder while leveling and not die a single time. Try that in classic with a proper level group and you will wipe time and time again. Even just questing and pulling 1 too many mobs and you die in classic where in retail you can just mass pull entire areas, kill them and move onto the next area without even pausing between.
---
why not both? I am getting my Valve Index and Classic in the same month :)
---
There's nothing "truest classic" about that. "Streamers" existed back then too - or rather something with a similar influence: famous guilds. Everyone knew where the big guilds in EU played on and these servers were overrun by fanboys. It's really just the same.
---
The idea is honestly terrible. Let people play the game how and where they want. You can try to avoid the biggest streamers servers if they announce them previously, but otherwise they're just a part of the community like everyone else.
---
most of the fun from raiding is just the teamwork and accomplishments, not pushing buttons in a interesting pattern.
---
or you just try to switch from the streamers layer
---
Patch 2.4.0: "Flag carriers can now be tracked 45 seconds after picking up the flag."
---
Most certainly, in BC.
---
Nay.. cause I'd nev'r be a cheatn' rogue. Stand and fight you horde filth
---
esfand didnt make this thread tho. he said "we summoned" the thread creator says "esfand summoned"... theres a difference, dont blame the streamer if a fan spreads misinformation.
---
I’m going to go armorsmith; I feel weapon Smith is very niche market with then having to go sword or axe specialization. And I want to make the thorium rep stuff when that comes out.
---
It's dungeon mobs that could sometimes teleport I believe
---
A LOT. I did it multiple times. As a Warrior, during leveling, I would use Int elixirs and scrolls every time a new weapon dropped and I needed weap skill.
---
It's a sensible increase in skill. Even an 8 int buff scroll is noticeable.
---
Oh man the people who never played vanilla don't know what they're in for lol
---
I find Asmongold way more punchable, but I don't watch streamers anyway.  I'm not going to judge people who find them entertaining, just not interested myself.
---
It’s just the Russian alphabet on that
---
Forsen.
---
I second this. It would make a lot more people take a lot longer to level and truly is the vanilla spirit. Blizzard DID say “we will ban addons that go against the spirit of vanilla” and decursive is one of them
---
Thank you, yeah that video definitely hits a certain nerve hahaha.
---
You're gonna need a shit ton of int to shave off 40 minutes of grinding though. The mage buff by itself is pretty small.
---
You make good points, but with the inclusion of battlenet integration, it’ll make it even easier to just whisper your contact on the other faction
---
&gt; I'd disagree, I think it's definitely enforceable. Have a handful of "Black" servers where publicly sharing images of gameplay is a bannable offence.
---
Just so I get this straight: you believe it is desirable or doable (from a PR standpoint) to create a server - a public environment - where it is a *bannable offence* to share an image of gameplay?
---
A new player joins the server, plays for a few weeks, posts a video of his Onyxia kill to a social media. Upps, sorry. You are banned now! Should've known better than to want to share your accomplishment with your friends.
---
Streaming is just one of these things that are here to stay. These servers wouldn't be enforceable due to the sheer issues of PR they'd cause. A server where you can never stream or share gameplay and supposed to play on normally would be deserted pretty soon.
---
So if they introduce new vanilla content and also introduce BC do you think they'd introduce new BC content too?
---
Hunter has an involved rotation also. Also, remember that since rogues and warriors have an infinite resource, they don’t have to buy mana pots on top of all the other stuff they need to bring for raids.
---
Thanks, you too!
---
Perplexity, Madseason, Mn, Esfand, Payo
---
What are you talking about, this dude is a damn inspiration, he's the one that HELPED make classic what it is now. He was a team leader in vanilla and knew what he was doing. If he chose to be back on the classic wow team i bet everything would be going better
---
While that may be true for a prot warr, - as OP was planning to play - you can really pool alot of rage as arms/fury. Arms warr can get 30 rage with one big white crit and when the mob dies, you just Bloodrage bandage to get health and keep gathering rage for the next pull.
---
Farming as a prot warrior is less about the lack of resources available, but more about the lack of damage you deal whether or not you have rage.
---
Can agree with that.
---
Was just wondering the comparison between those two.
---
I'm not sure on fury warriors, but rogue's rotation isn't that much more "interesting" than anyone else's. You're just hitting SS and SnD for the most part. Sneak in the Eviscerates when you can without dropping SnD. 
---
The rotations were not the interesting part of vanilla raiding.
---
Yeah not exactly disappearing but like.. they start to run in one direction and then rapidly change direction- and due to your ping you see them moving off in direction A for a little bit and then they zip back to where they actually are.   It's reallly hard as a melee class to stick on them consistently.  You see it sometimes playing pservers based in the EU on a bad night, getting like 100-200ms ping from the east coast in America and it's noticeable.  Not crazy but noticeable.
---
I dunno, people get bored of even fresh content pretty quickly (yes even back then.)  How quickly will they get bored of old content?  The phases will likely be fairly fast, like every 2-3 months maybe?  I don't actually know.
---
Yep I'm just a relentless nitpicker
---
This is really the essence of the whole thread.  PvE master race folks being mad that they weren't as good at killing players as they were at killing patterned automatons because they lacked the experience and specialized gear.
---
/u/ruffneckflex3 this pve-centric vs pvp-centric argument has been around since 2007; don't expect anything to get resolved now :P
---
I loved that zone as a hunter. I would do those quests at the lodge asap so that I could get that awesome green bow at the end of the quest chain!
---
A boring rotation is still killing the fun. There's only so much teamwork and "accomplishments" during 5 minutes of frostbolt spam - one of the reasons I'm not rolling a mage (though mainly to switch classes :) )
---
Yes if you want to push many buttons fast go play Osu 😁
---
In b4 the anti streamer jerk circle shit Lords arrive
---
K
---
Nope.  Layering is suppose to be removed after phase 1.  It's mainly to deal with the huge amount of players in the starting areas.
---
I'm sure some people will find a way to abuse it while it lasts though.
---
What do you expect a Druid at level 30 to do? As if PVP only revolves around doing damage, there’s so many other aspects to it.
---
I don’t think you understand the word arbitrage
---
I always knew it's what I want. I thought about it a lot in the past ... 10 years (since WotlK actually). I know what I want.
---
But judging by what is popular in gaming and what I think of it oftentimes, I'm not sure if the gaming community as a whole is in agreement with my taste.
---
Call of Duty, Fortnite, Loot Boxes and all that fucking junk... can you see my point?
---
Maybe everyone hates it and classic will change the industry for the better. But I don't know. And I don't believe any of the hyped up peoples that they KNOW. 
---
I love TOOL (the band) and think they're the best thing since sliced bread, but they don't exactly have mass appeal. I'm just humble enough to admit that my taste is not universal. Maybe it is with classic. But I don't know. Nobody does.
---
Won't the streamer servers just be a handful, since they'll want to be on the same one's with each other? I'm assuming there will be enough interest in classic to have multiple US servers that won't have streamers on them.
---
I appreciate Esfand a lot here.  The guy knows the game super well and is very good-natured to boot.  Seems to always be having a good time.  Never salty.  Would definitely recommend him.
---
real talk, the stress test was pretty dead during asmon events. They were cool and all, but it made the rest of the world feel much more desolate
---
But like, all of those classes are brought for their utility, then why aren't rets bought when melees benefit the most from the resistance auras due to them actually being in range of the rets, and having the best BoM in the game? Aside having the rest of paladin utility, and decent damage to top it off?
---
Oh boy, Alexsensual and his personal insane crusade driven by his grudge against Blizzard continues..
---
Gonna check this out when I get home. Thanks
---
tribe and perp are interactive and really good at vanilla
---
sry moo
---
If you don't think the beta looks fun then please block me.
---
The only reason im rolling horde. That way all those undead rogues wont be able to gank and camp my corpse if im on the same faction as them.
---
This is the biggest problem for me. Raid drops don't make you feel powerful, so it became pretty pointless to raid in tbc onward. I still have fun doing it, but why am I switching all my gear the moment I'm in the open world?
---
thorns on a pet is actually huge. pretty large dps boost, built in aoe threat - just an all round underappreciated mana to value ratio.
---
never seen that tooltip before
---
Monkeynews is my favorite by far. He focuses on playing the game over being an entertaining streamer. His skill in the game and personality make it an enjoyable stream
---
ignore list wasnt big enough...
---
Yeah the big problem moving from 1.12 to x.xx, is that right now almost everyone agrees that this is the Vanilla experience.
---
Once you start patching stuff adding content that where the trouble starts with the community.
---
The real trouble at Blizzard is that they were NEVER EVER good at decision making matching content + balancing. They released new game mechanics like Arena 2v2 and 3v3, without think about the impact of the game. So they always over nerfs and over buff classes to please the masses.
---
So if they go down the line of releasing new spells again and introducing arenas we are going down the same path.
---
The only way I see make this work is to keep the same PvP system, add more battleground forget about arenas and keep the same spell tables. Then work on balancing everything from there.
---
The normalization of wow;
---
It's not normal in my opinion that a rogue can self heal with a spell it breaks the game and remove the core of the class. A rogue should be powerful and conning, but in the low tier of survival. So if you want to PVP sorry buddy but you have to rely on bandage/potion/your skill to get out of a sticky situation.
---
The normalization of spells in wow killed the game for me, everyone have a heal, everyone is top dps don't worry you get your cookie too...
---
I think Hybrid classes should be rethought ;
---
A druid should be good at everything but not better than the main classes that are meant to heal/tank/dps. They should find a way to make them fit as is like they are right now and release class gear and enchant that make them better at one aspect. So you have to grind down the path you want to play and not just change talent and voila! you're as good as a priest.
---
Like I said changes in game mechanic will bring conflict to the purist and the way "Classic wow" should be.
---
:P
---

I like what he does for WoW. although I am not a fan he has a big following which means interest in the game. However, to think he won't have an impact on his server is woefully ignorant. I assume you are aware of how scarab lord works. Rep farming can be done in a day with the support he will get. No one else will be able to reach the requirements in the same amount of time without a similar support system.
---
I understand the need for a key puller next to you at all times.
---
Visually it looks something like this. I used the numbers AVWoW used to keep it consistent.
---
Server/Realm A: (12k pop)  
---
 \- Layer 1 (3k pop)
---
\- Layer 2 (3k pop)
---
\- Layer 3 (3k pop)
---
\- Layer 4 (3k) pop)
---
Server/Realm B: (12k pop)  
---
Thats the thing I love about Diablo 3.  1 to Max in 20 minutes.
---
It depends if you consider quest comprehension and navigation to be gameplay. I'm of the opinion that they are. (Hell, there are quests in the game where the quest text is an outright riddle that needs to be deciphered.)
---
But Blizzard hasn't cared about those elements of the game in over a decade, hence why they eventually removed them from the game, and why I don't think they'll act on them in classic.
---
Don’t play.
---
Ya; until you get gear and can chain pull ; farming for stuff is really slow as a warrior; you also get beat out of tags from every ranged class; even rogues throw is quicker I think than the warriors shoot.
---
You can't really control that.  I despise the culture, but it's not something that can be changed.
---
However!  Streamer culture is fickle as fuck and I expect after 6 months streaming of Classic won't have too much of a problem outside of raid releases for small upticks.
---
Imp motw instead of furor?
---
What you smoking mate? The heart of the mountain 😂👌
---
&gt; This sub is pretty toxic ~~towards new players/people asking simple questions, and honestly the content that is upvoted can be...well, quite confusing (and often toxic) to people that dont know much about the game.~~
---
FTFY
---
There were Alliance quests in stonetalon mountains. Thats when i first saw keeper/dryads i think.
---
Yah but that's just part of the meme... No one could afford fraps in 2004-2006! ;)
---
This is nice. I like this. I like this a lot.
---
Classe design can't ruin balance, only tuning can.  Besides they can redesign it anyway if they want.
---
Go play a TBC private server then.
---
Where? In America? I know they are crazy about work but that's just ridiculous.
---
Im just saying if you want to heal go priest, if you want to DPS go with the lock
---
u dont know Balow ? ...shame on u :P
---
and yes he is streaming.
---
That wasn't my argument, stop building strawmen.
---
My argument is: You are wrong if you state that the Beta is somehow "unique" and "never-seen-before".
---
It is fun, in the same way as playing In late August until lvl 30 will be fun.
---
Just out of curiosity, which of  [these german streamers](https://www.twitchmetrics.net/channels/follower?lang=de) are likely to play wow Classic?
---
I prefer PVP way more than PVE and play PVP 90% of the time but i hate that the absolute best gear comes from PVP only. I much prefer the vanilla way where you actually have to explore the entire game world to get the best gear.
---
That really is the dream man. Here's hoping. Until then, I'll experience Vanilla for the first-ish time!
---
I've never gotten that impression from him.  If I've ever seen him whinge, it always seemed tongue-in-cheek.  I don't think I've ever seen the guy actually salty.
---
Kargoz is the man and he has some incredible leveling guides on youtube
---
I mean, probably wouldn't complain about an extra 16 hp/s when regen kicks in, it is better than a mage stopping to conjure food for you pre-15.
---
I'm really glad to hear that. I love dwarves and it feels like the dwarven areas don't get any love in discussions. 
---
I felt really bad when my friends called Dun Morough music "the Winterspring song"
---
Aren't 90% of Vanilla zones ALREADY ghost towns on established servers in vanilla?
---
Only discovered Payo yesterday, the dudes hilarious and kind of a dope in charming way
---
&gt; you still had the ability to get some very high level gear if you only wanted to PVP
---
I don't think you remember just how much time you had to play your character in order to get rank 13 or 14 in the OG honor system.  That was the only way to get purple pvp gear.  You had to play like 16 hours a day for months on end with no breaks because your progression in that system was based on your honor gained relevant to other players.  It wasn't some static currency that you could accumulate at your own pace.  If you took a week off of playing, your rank went way down and you had to grind it back up again.
---
I remember him watching reacting to a Madseasonshow video about avoiding streamers. One of the points Madseason said was "thinking about Scarab lord? forget it" - Asmons reaction was to agree and comment that he will be getting it ASAP  
---
Not sure if he is serious as its hard to ever know with him. But I think he is being honest.
---
By aq and naxx, warlocks actually do really good damage. And their utility is actually %100 needed. Ex: warlocks tanking twin emps and hunters for tranq shot. Some ret pally utility is alright but it’s never needed. There are also a few fights in naxx where ranged dps is better than melee, like 4hm
---
Sl is amazing at pvp you just need a bunch of gear for the damage to be good
---
Holy shit, is that a Kanjii - Keyboard?!? I haven't seen one like that since the early 90s!
---
Always give the Void Thorns. or any pet really, it does help.
---
&gt;oh no, it's retarded
---
I used to watch his videos but got sick of the negative vibe he always seems to have. I prefer to watch/listen to people who at least sound like they're having fun.
---
He did make one really good video a while ago but I can't seem to find it anymore.
---
you don’t think we’ve seen this in the previous 20 twitch clips that was posted on the exact same thing?
---
Using it as a source to back your point doesn't make sense when on the landing page the site stats
---
*Who - It's important to remember that we're simply counting the number of characters seen for each category. This does not mean the number of players, nor the number of actively played characters. We can't efficiently get activity data yet, so some characters may not have been played for a long time.*
---
I don't really care who or what has more players just pointing out you can't rely on that site to determine unique activity
---
"wtf mom"
---
I see what you mean, even if it doesnt work for all and it fails to change the industry, atleast we will have a beacon of light to fall back to for there are truly dark times ahead then.
---
To some extent this is true, but the classes still had an identity.  Honestly, i have fonder memories from vanilla, but i always thought TBC was on par from a gameplay prospective.
---
madseasonshow.  Great YouTube channel with exceptional analysis and content.  Very genuine and a joy to watch
---
Purely horizontal content means no incentive to do any content since it won't make your character stronger.  And yes, this is the primary motivation for many players.  The "gear treadmill" has always existed, and is pretty necessary imo.
---
there's lots more to raiding than just spamming frostbolt, early boss fights takes a minute or 3 in vanilla anyway, and in AQ you actually have more interesting stuff.
---
See... I completely disagree. (Unless your point is after 16 hours of BFA you nope'd out)
---
My biggest issue as a casual in BFA is, that I cannot just derp around in Iron Forge.  at 60, there is actually very little to do. All the tasks, take so much longer, and Bag space is so screwey. But, BFA forces you to do 1-1.5 hours of WQs every day or you fall behind on AP. You HAVE to get loremaster if you want flight, you HAVE to do Islands if you want AP ect. I felt BFA kill my desire to log in and see stuff, I felt like a giant yoke was forcing me into trivial garbage, when I really want to putz around.
---
I'm still working through the VOD. I'll add that to the list when I get there!
---
...fair.  I was just addressing this particular comment :)
---
I've always wanted to witness that or it whispering to you in your bag.
---
Coolest weapon ever.
---
&gt; we wouldn't want anyone having fun

---
Ah good times.
---
There was still a fair amount of world pvp in TBC, especially in hellfire.
---
Difficulty is relative, it does not mean # of boss mechanics you have to avoid
---
I also like that. Buying "extra" flight paths. Maybe have a story arch that reduces flight costs at the end, etc.
---
It was mostly just a stylistic device. The first paragraph, anyhow.
---
The gist is that I think it's not enforceable, simply because it would break down on itself once the first bans for minor offences are handed out.
---
well yeah I’m sure he’ll go for it and try to get it ASAP but he’ll probably do it on his own. I guess only time will tell, but again, he knows how important this sort of thing is to people and I don’t think he’s gonna do anything to mess with that.
---
and you’re right, it is hard to tell if he’s ever serious, he usually isn’t. and that’s kinda the problem is some people don’t see past that and believe everything he says as fact and that’s just not how Asmon works, haha.

&gt;Arbitrage is the simultaneous purchase and sale of an asset to profit from an imbalance in the price. It is a trade that profits by exploiting the price differences of identical or similar financial instruments on different markets or in different forms. Arbitrage exists as a result of market [inefficiencies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inefficientmarket.asp) and would therefore not exist if all markets were perfectly efficient.
---
**Edited..**
---
*Perhaps I don't, I thought I used the term correctly, even if not technially they way a broker would.*
---
Buying crap from the early market, and resaling later when the market matures.
---
Buying from the leveling market, and resaling to the twink and raider market..
---
Buying from the Long term  auctions, and reselling in the immediately available market.
---
Rly friendly from you two. My post isnt against the rules so enjoy. And have a nice day 👍😁
---
Add on the &lt;APES&gt; crew, they are some of the best and most dedicated players: Moo_uk, perplexitycya, tribes etc
---
Helps with leveling up weapon skills I hear. I didn't notice a real difference. I try to keep my weapon skills up to date instead of waiting until I need them.
---
It was mostly in jest. You made good points.
---
Nope, buying low and selling high is definitely not the definition of arbitrage.
---
He's being sarcastic if you can't tell
---
If you want to learn about your class at its maximum potential watch these guys.
---
Not really, unless you were on a low pop server
---
His stream is pretty fun.
---
I've been debating this myself so I did some math on it:
---
If you have 25% crit, then on average you deal 130% of normal damage (`.75 * 1.0 + .25 * 2.2 = 1.3`) per attack. The maximum damage you can deal is 220% of normal damage when you crit.
---
If you add 5% crit to that, then it becomes 136% of normal damage (`.70 * 1.0 + .30 * 2.2 = 1.36`) on average. The maximum damage you can deal is still 220% of normal damage.
---
If you instead add 5% sword spec, then on average you deal 136.5% of normal damage (`1.3 + .05 * 1.3 = 1.365`) per attack. The maximum damage you can deal, however, is now 440% of normal damage when both attacks crit.
---
Double crit sword procs only happen on .03% of attacks (`.25 * .25 * .05 = 0.003125`), but you deal 320% of normal damage if only one of the two attacks crit which happens on 2.2% of attacks (`(1 - 0.75 * 0.75) * .05 = 0.021875`).
---
On top of all of that, you actually have a 0.25% chance to get a double sword proc. Each of the three attacks can crit, so if you get lucky you can basically delete someone instantly. If you're ultra lucky you can get more than two procs.
---
It will now take you 5 seconds to master the rotation instead of 15mins, that's about the only difference.
---

Why would any of the big streamers jeopardize their account?  Many of them have a relationship, and I use that word loosely, with Blizzard; they get invites to media events, they are afforded the opportunity to conduct interviews with Blizzard staff and post those interviews to their YouTube channel, and they also all got Beta invites.  All those things benefit the streamers, why would they risk that?  Also of note, I don’t see any of them streaming from private servers...so they do follow rules when it threatens their livelihood.  
---
As far as the legality, I don’t know.  I assume Blizzard can set and enforce their TOS as they see fit.  As far as private servers I believe that violates the DMCA, which may be why you don’t see people streaming that content, but I’m not a lawyer so all that is outside my scope of practice.
---
I started in August of 2005, and stopped playing sometime in the middle of Cata (though I'd say I was pretty done by the time Cata came out, I gave it a shot.)
---
I put in a good 7 years or so. I enjoyed vanilla a ton, BC too, and Wrath as well, because I had a great 10-man heroic guild and a lot of server-side friends I was competing with for server first 10 man heroic kills.
---
All that said, yeah, I'll totally put in another 7 years (or more) if they are able to bring back the elements of the game I enjoyed so much. Over time, they stripped what made the game really enjoyable to just lose yourself in, it became a mindless grind instead of a meaningful grind, communities were blended and lost their cohesiveness, and pvp lost a lot of the RPG appeal with the phasing out of the old honor system.
---
I could go on, but that's the gist of it.
---
Hi, /u/postfu
---
I could open chat window before, so that's not the issue.
---
I have to say that Kevin Jordan’s stream is excellent, too.
---
"I don't see how can a stat affect immersion in any way, it doesn't even affect your gameplay"   
---
Every little thing like that, that are added and make no sense in the actual game world breaks immersion piece by piece, when there is more and more stuff like that it becomes the slot machine arcade game that retail feels like.
---
It makes absolutly no sense that the guy who raided the best raids and has all his stats higher than mine has ABSOLUTLY NO CHANCE in beating me just because i have this magical stat called resilience. Blue resilience gear would destroy BIS raiding gear.
---
Arena ruined wow. Everything became too competitive and suddenly everyone was more interested in perfect comps rather than playing what they liked or rather living as a character in a fantasy world. Things were in general better in burning crusade. Better itemization for more specs and some tweaks in talent system but I would not want tbc back just because it has so much that later started wow's downfall. Rather keep classic and build more content without powercreeping. New events, zones and long quest chains. Content for mini groups (3-5 players but not raid) and perhaps even some single player/class challenges. Again no powercreep rewards but only content for the sake of challenging yourself or something small like cosmetic new forms like naga
---
So the guild is awesome for one reason: Sheer numbers. There are 1000 people in the guild which means there are always people to do stuff with.  Want to do BGs, there are people.  Want to run an dungeon, hop of guild chat and your group is filled in 3 minutes.  Getting ganked and need help, call the guild.  The streamers are dumb but they drew a crowd that benefits the rest.
---
Driving home the point that Raiding is not what makes an MMO.
---
Esfand
---
As the other guy said R14, ur heavy hitting abilities cares about your weapon upper dmg number, also DPS is important but for example in pvp you wont be 24/7 swinging your target so you generally want to hit as heavy as possible when you are finally on that hunter or mage or whatever !
---
PS: keep in mind that whoever thinks vanilla raiding is hardcore .... deluded..
---
Ive raided and cleared AQ and Naxx and my guild raided 2-3 times a week 4hrs , sometimes on  1 night we do MC and BWL same night and AQ other night etc...
---
On the other hand... pvp thou :) that hardcore in vanilla, consider yourself playing every day 12-14 hrs in bg's for that weapons :) not just few nights with guild pve ..:)
---
Yes. At launch, they're going to use layering to prevent unbearable queue times. After the initial surge of players tapers off, they're planning to merge the layers, like classrooms coming together for a school assembly, or a field day, but a permanent one.
---
God, I miss field days...
---
They haven't been specific as to when the merging will specifically happen though, probably because they want to see how things will go.
---
&gt;This was not the way in vanilla 
---
Are you sure? Did you check some videos from back then to confirm it, or track down the TBC patch in which flag locations were added?
---
You should go feral for leveling. Feral druid is actually one of the fastest levelers and can still heal dungeons. Anything else would be masochistic.
---
I remember him from back in the day, where he told funny stories. I don't even think they were videos, or were they?
---
And I don't watch any German Youtubers or Streamers, so I'm kinda out of the loop regarding what is going on in the gaming community of my own country. ^^
---
Just the fact that we're now getting fresh widescreen screenshots from a 15 year old game still is hard to wrap my head around, its gonna be awesome at release.
---
Eh, not that much mana. You'll quickly regen from a drive-by-buffing while running to the next area. Plus, you're a mage. You have free water.
---
imo drive-by-buffing is a way to say hello. I've known warlocks who give people unending breath just as a friendly action.
---
Typically:
---
* Alliance is going to be Human for both PvP &amp; PvE. This is due to their additional skill in weapons, which increases your hit chance, reducing dmg reduction for glancing blows and the like. Perception is also great vs Rogue/Druid
---
* Horde the general rule of thumb is going to be Orc. Due to Blood Fury for extra AP, and the additional axe skill which I believe is most beneficial in BWL, given best end game weapons are swords for fury. PvP wise, the stun resist is also really nice for Rogue/Pala. Argument can be made for Undead for WoTF but you have zerker rage &amp; Death Wish anyway if your fury.
---
Has elvui been ported over to classic already?
---
I already have 2 30s in beta, working on 3rd.
---
6 slots are still exciting
---
whatever the hell happened to playing the damn game yourself instead of watching some hipster from the west coast grind boars for the first time
---
hope you are right, but then again we are all within our rights to want to avoid that!
---
He was good when it actually mattered. World first KT when it was current means a lot more than any pserver bullshit 10 years later.
---
Think of WoW classic as a vintage car restoration. Once it's been restored, there is no reason to keep "improving" it. People like it as it is. There will always be people that want a faster car, or one with Bluetooth, but there is no place for those things in a '69 Chevy.
---
None of that is enough to sate the desire for stronger and stronger gear.  Except for the legendary quests, I love those.
---
I don’t care about Nax or 1k damage for bosses. 
---
Math can’t be wrong. Feeding the “wrong numbers” doesn’t make the math wrong, it makes the source variables wrong.

Lanchesters law is not wrong. Ever. Show me one example of differentials being wrong. Not people using the data wrong, but the math being wrong.

If I recall correctly, he mentioned that he won't take "handouts" until he has his epic mount. He's going to do the initial gold grinds on his own, but once he's established on his server, he will take the handouts.

&gt;Thank you for the useless but thoughtful buff, kind stranger
---
&gt;Why would any of the big streamers jeopardize their account? 
---
Do the rules only apply to big streamers?
---
Prefer the cowmen who eat grass out in the fields alongside their fat rhinos? Or the trolls who are sketchy as fuck and probably do living sacrifices? Or the literal undead abominations with rotting flesh and probably smell like hot ass?
---
Nah dog mudhuts and ruins aint cool
---
&gt;I doubt anyone would mind the new talents and spells from TBC tho, it made a lot more specs playable.
---
Ehhh. There's good and bad stuff. Some of the things they did solved major issues, such as adding Steady Shot gave hunters a filler ability, fixing their DPS scaling in PvE while not making them busted in PvP. Giving Shamans dual wield removed their heavy RNG burst, allowing their overall damage to be increased.
---
But at the same time, as a Mage, I strongly detest Water Elemental for enforcing a pet component on mages, opposite to the existing class fantasy, and in general making frost so OP in PvP that people genuinely forgot mages could be anything but frost. Ice Lance was also horrible, as I consider it the start of every class being given far too many instant casts (with little to no cooldowns). All classes gradually got so freaking mobile that Blizzard just gave up after some time and made various spells able to be cast while freaking moving. I still can't get over the stupidity of that concept.
---
" One might say it's a good thing since it doesn't force people to do content they don't like "
---
This is a big problem blizzard did in my opinion, decided to divide the playerbase. This is an MMO, not a PVP game, or a dungeon runner, its an MMORPG. In my opinion you should go through every single aspect of the game to get BIS gear. Yea you might not enjoy some things, but you dont like everything in real life either. An MMO kinda tries to be a living breathing world, and when you divide players with clear "on-rail" paths the world becomes fake and soulless in my opinion. Sometimes you should be forced to do things you dont like, dont be able to fully enjoy the things you actually like.
---
20-50g just for repairs mind you, that doesn't add in all the other costs of raiding as a Tank, Consumables can easily bring your daily raiding costs up to 100-200g per day depending on how much your guild demands everyone to be fully consumabled up every night.
---
Has he? ive watched him a few times and he was getting traded a shit ton of stuff from fans. He would not be where he is today just by putting in the hours.
---
Did you even play vanilla? If you asked questions about a quest your only answer would be “did you check thottbot”. And here’s a thought, mind your own business. Don’t be the douche that try’s to control other people’s experience because you’re a salty fool.
---
The lv70 skills would be nice tho but just that, and the raids from tbc/wotlk could be adapted to lv60 somehow i hope, I would rlly love to do ulduar again.
---
I don’t see a problem with it in the beta. It’s not like any of these items have any real value, so I might as well just trade them to a streamer so that they can provide better streaming content. 
---
On live servers, nah fuck that
---
Yet mages still do way more than 4warlocks+1 priest for shadow weaving. I'm perfectly aware why they are bought to raids, and the same way retributions become much better DPSes as well, especially starting at AQ. My point is, I never understood people strictly thinking about not bringing certain classes to raids due to having lower DPS. Especially for hybrid classes, it's the utility that matters.
---
Son... Westfall, Duskwood, Redridge...
---
I mean, I love the fuck out of almost all of the Eastern Kingdom. 
---
 Kalimdor is kind of ehhh.
---
Weapon speed is your biggest factor for 2h. It's the top end dmg you want to pay attention to when making direct comparisons.
---
Came here to say this. Ziqo is a super cool dude and the only streamer I have ever subbed to!
---
I am really sad they never did the card game idea. Collecting rare cards out in the world is way more interesting than inserting a credit card number.
---
I have been GM/RL this whole time, hardcore raiding only got worse each expansion in every way, especially time investment. You needed more and more alts to do splits, which all needed AP/M+ grinding, the level of player you needed in terms of skill only got higher and the pool to recruit from shrunk as the playerbase shrunk.
---
I get what you are saying but it got worse in every way you can imagine outside of raidsize.
---
You were on a dead ass server then if that's how you remember it.
---
Is there a TLDW for those of us at work?
---
It looks great and just think about we playing on 144hz, crisp!

---
Did totem twisting work in vanilla?
---
you would be surprised at the number of people that cleared mythic emperor but couldn't tough it out through molten core anniversary event.  herding 39 cats instead of 19 cats is a big fucking difference.  also the time investment to do a raiding night that took up hours especially if you didn't down a boss to stop respawns for the next night was pretty disheartening.  you also had to deal with bad internet connections, missing classes that were required for certain mechanics and generally 40 ppl not attempting or seeing the boss room until the trash and prior bosses were cleared.  
---
You are not giving vanilla raiding with hardware and connection issues during 04-06 as much credit is it is due.  You have to look at all the aspects to justify comparing raiding KJ mythic in 2017 with DBM, 1080p screens, 20 less players, way better voice communications and freely accessible video guides based on tens of hours of PTR testing.
---
No sorry, I gave them all to  Nixxiom, ask him for them! :)

D3 came out 5/12/12.
---
Wow Came out 11/23/04
---
By 5/12, wow was on the tail end of Cata prepping for MoP release. 
---
D3 has main stats--just like wow--they even call them int, agi, str...just like wow. Nevermind d2 had totally different convention. 
---
D3 like wow pretty much follows the rule of, if the number is bigger, put it on. 
---
Meanwhile in D2, magefist is a valuable glove item for the entirety of the game and it can drop as early as like level 20. 
---
D3 lowers your cds (haste), increases raw dmg of your abilities (Spell Power,  AP), and has 2 cirt related stats (wow just has crit chance, but imo, crit size is a super boring stat).
---
D2 and wow before hit was removed had breakpoints and negative stats. Modern wow and d3 just want you to put on any gear that has a + and a green number after it. 
---
In my opinion, D2 is the greatest itemization system of all time, the interplay of the base stats, with the myriad of valuable defensive stats, breakpoints and the on equip auras to the +skills. and i think a haste-light, hit-full world with spirit and mp5 and defense cap (while needing to consider tps) is the best wow was.
---
No problem! I'm a die hard min maxxer at heart but I'm actually going differently for vanilla. I want Female UD for those incredible animations aha. Best of luck to you! I've been keen to find a fury warrior in the beta using DW to see the hit chance but can't find much. I will level 2h anyway, but just curious!
---
Practice.
---
definitely not a bad choice for casual playing.
---
In fact tank is probably one of the best classes to level and play at 60 for non-raiding. Keep in mind it's not good at farming but dungeon wise you will pretty much have the easiest time finding groups for 5 man content. Also as a more lofty goal start doing UBRS groups if you have a long play session for that sweet 10 man loot including the highly sought after Draconian Deflector.
---
It's hard to raid as a tank because they only bring maybe 1/10 players as a tank in 40 mans but for 5-10 man dungeons you are 1/5 of the party so makes it super easy to find group because demand is so high compared to supply for pre-raid content.

You get used to it,   However an easier solution is to get an mmo mouse with 12 buttons in the side and bind everything to that

Find something that works for you, I personally use 2,3,4,q,e,r,f,mb4,mb5 + shift + ctrl modifiers. Unbound keyboard turning for strafing on a&amp;d.

Wrong. Was in Vanilla.

Are you eating lobster every day? My monthly food bill is about €100, less if I can get some good finds in the dumpsters. Usually you can find perfectly fine vacuum packaged food in there, just being thrown away.

Rent is €330 with free internet and I don't need a car since the shop is right next door.

I make €27/hr from my main job as a Google AdWords consultant (fancy job title for writing ads online) and 40€/hr from my second job as a substitute teacher, but that income isn't reliable and will usually be taxed in full 38% because I make more from my main job, usually.

Of course having a kid and house makes things expensive. I certainly admire the people who are willing to sacrifice their time and money to raise kids, I just couldn't do it.

I had to wake up like 2 hours before school back in the day to farm herbs for flasks and farm gold / pray the AH was kind to me so I could afford repair bills.
---
Sorry I have no idea! Browsing wow classic on twitch you can find some german, you might find it directly
---
I was fortunate, guild provided consumables as MT. 
---
But repairs and respec were on me. That ran me probably 100-150g (50 respec, 50 repair, 50 respec)
---
I have also already done that!  This graph thing is just part of the fun for me.
---
I agree whole heatedly with PVE mechanics, However, if you get a chance to listen to Venruki talk about his PVP in the lvl 30 meta. You defiantly begin to see the PVPer's point.
---
It's a gift. Take it 😁
---
you guys have genius brains for noticing that
---
Thirded.  He's chill and funny, and he's good at the game too.
---
I'll check them out!
---
So a server with 4 layers will need 75% of the population to leave before they can be merged down to a single layer with c. 3k people? We may be looking at some high population servers if classic is more successful than expected.
---
Either give a proper answer or shut up
---
Nope, I will check them out thanks!

1.6.X

&gt;**Friendly flag carriers are now displayed on the overhead map in Warsong Gulch.**
---
Didn't see when the Hostile flag carrier was added in a quick look.
---
Sure there were realms that favored horde (Like Thrall) but overall Alliance had a huge population lead over Horde it's exactly the reason they got Blood Elves
---
The pool from a hardcore perspective is smaller now then it ever was because the requiered time investment/skill level is a lot higher.

Pretty much what the other guy said.

Took me over an hour to get 8 fucking ichors from the knolls outside of Brill. Not sure why I am so sadistic but I loved it. Can't fucking wait for classic!
---
At least this post gave me some kind of insight on some points.
---
Most people I know irl enjoyed it a lot, i just wanted to understand the hate surrounding it. 
---
I still have my own opinion about it, don't worry ;)
---
No, that's reality in almost every game. Sure there is a minority that enjoys it multiple times but majority just want to get to the juicy content at max after they have been through the leveling process.
---
Oh yeah! That'd be fine.
---
That’s not the point at all. He just wants to know the actual time saved.
---
And somehow mount is still unbound
---
Amen.
---
Yeah all the class design stuff he talks about is really interesting. Having these developers streaming is such a treat!
---
That's not what I argued about. I raid a lot on Retail and I've done so since vanilla. A boring rotation is still killing it for me on the long run. No raid is interesting enough that a single button rotation is fun for me.
---
The key is the philosphy driving the content. If the philosphy is there, and they release a crap piece of content, it's just a shitty raid or dungeon and not a game-altering change.
---
Guess he mentioned all your favourite streamers, eh? 🙂
---
She looks perfectly average to me
---
&gt; More so people choosing to follow someone else play the game instead of playing their own game and creating their own story. 
---
That's kind of a point the story makes. The book burning came after.
---
No reason to go HotW while leveling. The whole point of the build is to make druids a *passable* healer while still in a feral tank/dps/pvp spec. But, outside of raids/60 dungeons (and even in most 60 dungeons) you're fine as a healer so long as you have a healing set. Just level feral.
---
That's a great idea! I really think idols/librams/etc were kinda underused, so more of those + glyphs would be amazing for additional depth in itemization.
---
BOOBS
---
Locks can make friends too... They have cookies... And summons.
---
Holy shit was this last night, in the wetlands? Because I was leveling a druid through there last night and made sure every Hunter pet I came upon had motw and thorns. On beta ofc.
---
TBC is awesome but I think a lot of people who are in love with it don't remember what a fucking crazy grind fest it was
---
There's a reason TBC private servers have the least population and the most trouble retaining players.
---
Yes they are the most difficult to code but honestly most people get very very sick of doing their T5 attunements and rep grinds on anything more than one character, very very very quickly.
---
The cap is 30. Come August the cap will be 60. I have been playing since late 2005 and never have I ever played on a server with the maximum set to 30. That is inherently different that leveling past 30. Once classic comes out everyone is not going to stop at 30 to see what the meta is like there. We will be pushing on to 60. I have also never seen Ragnoras spawned in Northshire Abbey. Nor WSG with all level 10's. This stuff is by definition unique. I don't see how you can argue against it. Trying to put down others for wanting to be in the Beta is being a hater. My entire argument is that the beta is a unique and special event and I understand why someone would be disappointed that they only get to watch other people experience it.
---
Oh I know :) this is just part of the fun for me. I've already narrowed it down to the top 3 I want to play for fun. So this is just a little side project to give to me and my friends if they're stuck on choices too.
---
What's the downfalls for being on a streamers server?
---
This is just one example of what builds a community in vanilla and was killed off in retail imo. August cannot come fast enough!
---
The vanilla way was for 100% of the best gear to come from raiding though.  You didn't have to "explore" PVP at all to get the objectively "best" gear for playing battlegrounds.  The rewards you got through the vanilla PvP honor system were understatted compared to what you could get through raiding.  Even if you had the time to grind rank 14 through the honor system, had you invested that time in raiding instead you would have come out with better gear.
---
Personally I find Alt easier to hit than Ctrl or Shift. But my primary buttons are on my gaming mouse - Middle Mouse, then Numlock 1-6. So that's a ton of skills and they're easier to hit. Then I can do 1-5, Alt 1-5, Q, E, R, `, Alt Q, E, and R. That covers most stuff that needs keybinding. Other stuff doesn't need keybinds like buffs, res, etc. I use the F1-5 keys for random things as well like Mounts and other lesser used keybinds.
---
From what I've seen, it seems a lot of the NA streamers will be rolling on the same realms. If so, it should be relatively easy to avoid "streamer servers". Even if they don't announce which ones they are on, it's trivial to find out, just /who a few names on some realms. Infact, I would be shocked if there wasn't a list of realms to avoid posted within the first few days after launch.
---
And let's be real, the only ones you need to really avoid are Asmon, Esfand, Staysafe and Soda. Anything else shouldn't be a big deal.
---
The positivity in Sonii's streams has been what makes me really want to come back, even though I don't care for warrior gameplay. When I was watching a couple days ago someone donated specifically to make fun of Asmongold, and Sonii defended him, which I really respected even though I don't care for Asmon's streams myself.
---
it was patch 1.6.x that this was added, so it is completely correct for 1.12.1 release.
---
You know I totally forgot about that! That's a great point to bring up!
---
And people usually don't restore vintage cars for a profit but as a passion project. Blizzard however will want to see some profit and will probably consider restoring TBC and WotLK afterwards to "preserve it" seeing as those expansion also have a pretty large cult following but what then? Is there anyone out there waiting to run Cataclysm all over again? What will keep Blizzard's investment worthwhile? Do you honestly believe there will be enough people playing "just" Classic for multiple years without their being anything added to it for Blizzard to consider it worthwhile?
---
What the hell, yes it was in the wetlands last night... was this you my friend?!???
---
to be honest you wait till a patch comes out do some wq some lfr some keys a maybe a regular or heroic raid doesnt really matter if you dont do mythic your killing the same boss anyway. and your good to do anything. I never bothered to grind my neck it was pretty useless. it's a grind that even if you do get an extra trait it's like whatever. it's a never ending rollercoaster of garbage.
---
at least before you got 1 piece and even if it took long you knew it was good for a while.
---
Mark of the Wild gets no love here?  my personal favorite.  and druids are sneaky so I couldnt find who did it half the time.
---
5th biggest yt channel in the world has plans to play
---
Rogue rotation is something like
---
SS, SS, SnD, SS, SS, SS, evisc, SS, SnD, SS, SS, SS, SnD, SS, etc
---
You're basically refreshing SnD at the 1-3 seconds left range and dumping extra points into Evisc. That's it.
---
I do agree that they are a bit too cartoony in WoW and part of a pretty bad expansion over all.
---
But if the classic devs said they wanted to implement pandas in classic and implement them in a more "classic" way then i would be open to it.
---
TBC was overall a great expansion, i dont see why a TBC-developer-mindset of pandarien would neccessarily be worse than draenei.
---
Warlock will give you good odds to face off against all of those. Although I am not sure about respecs if you plan to raid/min/max. You can go SL warlock and just /lol while murdering all 3 of those classes.
---
As if they won't just be in discord voice chat with them?
---
You're basically refreshing SnD at the 1-3 seconds left range and dumping extra points into Evisc. That's it. You keep SnD up while not letting energy cap.
---
How about you go play on a Vanilla server then and don't play classic.
---
What kind of stupid fucking logic is this? Private server players are the reason you're getting Vanilla and now you're gonna spit in their face because they're hopeful to get tbc and wrath afterwards?
---
Go fuck yourself.
---
And gives you some kind of aviation related title. Oh and now the IF airport becomes open to you once you go up in rep. If you're and engineer, there could be a quest line that starts there that teaches you to build a plane. (I forgot what kind of engineering mounts were in vanilla though, if any.)
---
Edit: my bad this would all be a part of BC
---
Wouldn't all the streamers fight over the mount? Or is it expected for them to go to seperate servers on release?
---
Sorry I don't really like RPing
---
I'm not saying that gear that does x vs. beasts or dragons or whatnot is unrealistic; there's orcbane and dragonbane type gear all throughout fantasy. The distinction I draw is gear that protects you vs. human-controlled characters vs. computer-controlled characters. Why does this breastplate protect me against Analmuncherxx in the Arena but not against Thrall?
---
And I admit that the realism argument is probably the weakest or least important. I just really don't like it from a gameplay perspective mostly.
---
The question was population, not active players, even if I had the exact number of players playing BFA it would be as irrelevant because BFA is trash and nobody is playing it so even then it wouldn’t be a good representation.
---
A website that has been cited by Blizzard CMs several times on their forums over the last decade is a better source than just saying I’m wrong without evidence.
---
exclude asmon and soda and thats probably the largest viewcount among na streamers
---
This is the most woke foreshadowing I have ever seen.
---
Without expanding on it, how long do you think it'll take before the playerbase dwindles to the point where blizzard pulls the plug? No game rules forever my son.
---
I honestly hope there's enough servers with high enough populations to thrive like a regular server...that popular streamers aren't on. I seriously want to get as far away as possible from that kind of shit.
---
I would hope not, I think rules should apply to everyone, equally.  
---
I think the “big streamers” are what everyone is worrying about and I do not think they would roll on ‘non-streaming’ servers.  
---
Honestly, I think of the idea of “non-streaming” servers much like the theory of nuclear deterrence, it’s the threat of force, lol.  Truly I have no idea how or if they would enforce such a thing.
---
&gt; If tauren cant be rogues because they are to big 
---
Is that why? I always figured it was because they have hooves, and that was why Draenei can't be rogues either.
---
Retail is a soulless slot machine for all kind of other reasons.
---
"basically everything that isn't vanilla breaks the immersion, that makes no sense." 
---
How does it not make sense that its immersion braking that you can beat the BIS raider that has twice your stats in your blue gear because you have 1 magical stats that makes you unkillable for certain geared players? Its not rocket science after all
---
&gt; Warlocks spam shadowbolts, that's it. 
---
People who don't know how to play a warlock...
---
Yep, tl;dr :
---
- I really enjoyed my experience there
---
- Leveling is way easier than I expected it to be with that many people
---
- Layering is a necessary evil
---
- Devs spawning bosses in Stormwind is the most fun i've ever had in WoW
---
Remove "hero" aspect, start them at level 1.  Whats the problem now?
---
The mobility issue is partially solved with the 3-pc bonus of Warlord set, which reduces Intercept cooldown.
---
Which would become a problem if you cannot do the R12 grind, and if you only have the blue PvP set you lose quite a lot of stats, which is important for a warrior as a melee frontliner.
---
Where u get flag
---
It's my favorite iteration of druid... Generally a feral.
---
Same but my evis is R. :p
---
I don't even know how to reply to this, my mind is fucking blown away, how stupid can people be? non-Streamer server? Seriously?
---
You nailed it. I got a good laugh out of these.
---
Hydramist too.
---
Eww
---
So WoW Classic is actually WoW 2.0
---
That must have been a nice "beetle".
---
They dont allow numbers, military ranks or titles as names. "AssMaster6969" will have to wait for another mmo. Its in blizz's ToS about naming stuff.
---
Since you are a good lad, I'll save and watch later!
---
I think there are ways you can incentivice high level characters to check out low level content. 
---
For example, if you introduce a new rep grind, you can have rep rewards which are interesting for level 60s too. low level gear with on-use effects, or you could have enchants (new ranks of old enchants (+weapon damage, fiery, icy etc), new enchants, enchants from expansions), or new crafting recipes, or cosmetics (pets, mounts) or even special quest lines for reskinned abilities or new ranks of abilities.
---
Or you could have collaborative efforts like AQ opening, where everyone contributes to some extent. They maybe don't need to share the same mobs to fight, but they could share the same quest hub, and they could unlock content for both low and high level characters. Ex. they could unlock one level 30 dungeon and a raid dungeon. etc. 
---
Imo the way forward should be to give content to all players of the game, not just the hardcore max level players.
---
So are any of the beta testers even testing at this point or is everyone just in stormwind trying to get on a twitch stream?
---
I played vanilla pretty casually because I was sharing a pc with my brother, vanilla was great because there was stuff to do at all levels. I never reached 60, barely made 58 for TBC release, because it was so easy to get sidetracked from leveling. I probably spent more time trying to get my 19 rogue the best gear possible and brawling in the Gurubashi arena with my guild mates.
---
I'm almost envious of people getting to experience it for the first time, beware you may end up quitting ESO for classic though. Best advice is to just enjoy the game at your own pace, don't stress over power leveling and min/maxing etc.
---
Vanilla itself had quest addons you ape.
---
Hi, /u/FrugoUnderhill, your post has been removed as it is seems to be talking about the current stress test. Please use the current [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bui555/stress_test_2_the_megathread_of_omg_why_can_i_not/) instead.
---
You've put yourself on repeat. Explain to me why this happens. [https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/19866426474](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/19866426474)
---
Also, explain to me that why are there logs of people killing Anub'Rekhan with way above 1k dps for the fight (on progression, so not even ultimate BiS), yet when you begin to calculate the actual DPS, they usually have at least 50% weaker DPS.
---
THE MATH IS RIGHT, I SAID THIS 10 MILLION TIMES NOW. WHAT THE PROBLEM IS THAT DPS METERS ARE NOT MADE WELL, WHICH IS WHY DAMAGE DEALT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT, BECAUSE YOU CAN CALCULATE THE ACTUAL DPS THAT WAY.
---
As for Lanchester's Law, the calculations are close, but not perfect. There is always some variable that maths can't count for.
---
Are you talking about private servers or vanilla? AQ and naxx were absolutely not cleared the night they opened on Vanilla. C'thun wasn't even possible for a while due to a bug with the water in his stomach not loading, and Naxx was a trainwreck even for the best guilds in the world when it launched.
---
The thing you have to realize is that you're gaining new skills as you level, which takes time. After an initial couple spells you're really only learning 1-2 more keybinds at a time until your next set. So you have time to learn each one in increments.
---
You're not going to go into the game immediately having 15+ keybinds to memorize.
---
The one thing I would highly recommend is to unbind A and D as turning and do that with your mouse. Bind them as your strafe keys and free up your Q and E buttons.
---
I personally use ALT+keys for some of mine.
---
Raids are different in retail. They are focused on boss fights vanilla is not, it's a ton of trash lots of aoe lots of moving lots of drinking that can make at least mages interesting. But go play warrior/rogue/hunter then, they have somewhat similar rotation to retail.
---
Ive got another comment that says pretty much the same, but yeah id want a progressive nochanges server independent of classic+.
---
Id want the first pass at classic+ to be removal of debuff cap and retuning of raid fights as well as no nonsense ideas like gbanks or auto stand up with casting or auto dismount. 
---
Id want classic+ to be iteratively progressive. So season 1 of classic + is getting a new baseline for the classes, now that they can use dots. then season 2 is review of the new data and class balance pass as a result and possibly redesigning some of the less challenging raid and 5 man bosses. Then adding some new content after p6. 
---
I think its important to make slow measured changes to the old game. Further, I think its important there is a publicly available design document, the constitution for the Classic WoW experience. No new feature is allowed to cross that line. In addition, the devs and players of classic+ would need to maintain a symbiotic nature. Devs cant add new content without the approval of the players. So not only does the feature have to be within the design philosophy paradigm but it also has to specifically be desired by the community.
---
Oh well if you looking for that stuff you might want to devide each category by classes that can wear diff items, you could even go all the way down to spec.
---
Appreciate it !
---
I get that, it just seems like a huge missed opportunity to make cool names.  MrT for example is cool.  Mrt is stupid.
---
I'm not sure when this was changed, but it definitely wasn't this way for a long time.  It only changed because of the exploits in the BG, and how unfun it was to look for the flag carrier in those spots.  
---
I'd definitely prefer the flags not show up and they fix the bugs in the zone.
---
I was there so trust me I know the pain of raiding with 10 fps and you make very valid points. All that said, and perhaps I am biased coming from a GM PoV. The work it took to prep for raids was so wack, the PTR testing alone at stupidaclock did my head in.
---
In regards to addons, its a two way coin. Weakauras trivilised A LOT  later on (archimonde mythic as example.) Then again decursive for example did to. I personally feel it got worse as expansions went on but in the end its subjective.
---
edit: in regards to your edit, Algalon while your maintank just had his connection die as you started the one hour timer. Kaelthas in TK before they fixed it. Doing immortal runs on laggy servers and servers dieing/lagging still occured in Legion sadly. Most of these things stuck throughout the years sadly.
---
I don't think stuff like this should be a gift anyway. I'd end a relationship that used sex as gifts immediately
---
Patch 2.4.0: "Flag carriers can now be tracked 45 seconds after picking up the flag."  
---
Added in TBC.
---
Mr is a title thou
---
One of the reasons they even got to it was because guilds gave them frozen runes :) my guild was one of them, and we gave the majority they needed. I was in The Destiny.
---
efc  shows at last spotted position
---
Proof they don't know what they are doing.
---
He didn't mention it being a raid zone. Said it was a zone where you would do quests that you could only do while dead and all the dead characters from the lore were there to interact with.
---
They redid the camera intros with cata. Would make sense if the camera bit is the cata one with vanilla voice-over
---
LEEEEROOOOY
---
Basically - the difference was too large and (possibly more importantly) too obvious. Particularly PvP gear in raiding, IIRC, because the best available PvP gear was generally kinda equivalent to raiding gear 2 tiers out of date. It generally wasn't as bad the other way around.
---
There's a significant difference between "suboptimal" and "bad."
---
I mean there was chuck Norris jokes back in the day.  Not much has changed, just how they say it. Memes are memes.
---
It's okay, I'm not misremembering - but feel free to send that to blizzard on all of their socials and their forums!
---
- now that I actually think about it (sorry) it wasn't... I clearly remember that you could hide flag for the entire time.
---
My apologies.
---
I'm not upset! Just remarking.
---
Arms will be tough for raiding. You really need to be decked out, have flawless positioning / rotations for AoE or single target DPS and even then, you'll get beat by other pure DPS classes on most boss fights. Honestly I never had a lot of love for Fury in Vanilla, I don't think it hits it stride until much later in the game. Fury in PvP is a hard pass.
---
Protection is the premier Warrior PvE spec. It's not that sexy (although it can be), it's definitely slow starting out and you need to be pretty well geared to even get started, but I've geared up for Arms spec a lot faster than other Arms Warriors simply because I was a Main Tank and most people want to keep the tank very happy.
---
Arms will wreck in PvP and is much less gear dependent, but when you start getting competitive you really need to play at a very high level and you'll hit an effectiveness "wall" without the proper gear. Various intercept / stance dance / shield slam macros can be huge and when executed properly you can noticably turn the tide in a fight. Don't forget to sunder!
---
Not just ganking but imagine a whole swarm of clip chimp kiddos following a streamer around and tagging every mob they try to tag for quests or grinding or whatever. Would be super annoying as a streamer
---
ALso, in classic, not on cheater Pservers, there is NO way you will get a solid 11-20 in westfall on questing alone.  I did every quest (except for captian saunders)  obtainable in both zones, and still had to do 3 VC runs to hit 20
---
The most common way to cause a wipe as a single dps was always to pull aggro. These values make that easier to do compared to pservers.
---
Certainly. No need for me to take it personally, either. Yes, it's always the politics! I feel that politicians are just playing a stupid game amongst themselves, and the collateral is you and me. It's actually really messed up.
---
Anyway, getting back on topic. I might wait for a few days after release to see which servers NOT to join. I'm sure some kind redditor will make a post about it. I don't mind streamers in and of themselves, as many have pointed out, but it's the celebrity worship by their fans that turns me off. Man.
---
Some things never change. A friend of mine saw Zezima once in RuneScape. Same scenario. Poor fellow, couldn't go anywhere without a mob.
---
Oh cool! Can I preorder it?
---
And Soda's
---
For alliance hunters, both Zeroed and The_mechanic stream.
---
How about the idea of say molten core dropping significantly more gear per boss the when its really late.
---
In what sense would you want Karazhan re-imagined? As a 40 man raid, a dungeon, a 20 man raid?
---
I couldn't survive on $25 a week for food if I was 16 years old. So strange.
---
That’s easy to say now
---
I had to make a macro for thanking on the beta to be able to thank people for buffing. Since it happens so often
---
This will forever be burned into my brain for WoW.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM4okRvCg2g
---
God I had so much fun with that game. You could spec to wear shields as a spellcaster, so much uniqueness with each character.
---
This is of course only from memory, but I recall this happening towards either the very end of Vanilla or early BC for enemy carriers.
---
That's was the main plan! But now I'll have to go through a lot of BiS stuff now and see who's gonna kinda want what. It just made it a much bigger investment but at least it'll be a lot more accurate! :)
---
Knowledgeable player who knows to buff not only the player, but the pets.  Putting thorns on a priest is a no-no, putting thorns on a pet is a blessing and a true buff.
---
yeah that's fair
---
Alright well, the whole point of the “hero” class and what ruined balance is that Death Knights were just simply better than every other class simply because they could just do what the other classes did but better and they are always going to be strong so it also creates a class imbalance.
---
If you take that all away then you’d have to redesign the entire class and if they went that route I would prefer to just not even have Death Knights and just have Necromancers and Knights like they originally intended.
---
Haha you're welcome buddy! Also what is your in game name, I can probably go back into my vod and find the moment.
---
&gt; Arena is just a new aspect 
---
It's the method by which gear and titles were handed out. So it does have to be compared. It shifted from a pure time investment/game system manipulation exercise to a minimum time investment plus competition. Which if there are people who prefer their PvP to be non-competitive time investment competitions idk what to say.
---
&gt; Retail wow is balanced
---
Not really at all compared to TBC. Many specs are useless. I don't know what you mean by 'every spec can do everything the other specs do'. There's a whole history to this debate. 
---
Vanilla PvE: warlocks sit there casting shadowbolt with an invisible imp buffing stam, after summoning people. Mages sit there casting fireball/frostbolt after int buffing and making water. Shaman could sit there casting lightning bolt after dropping totems, but they go OOM after two minutes. Sounds a lot like class uniqueness and balance to me. Let's not even discuss how bad it would be if Druids could viably cast Nature Bolt in raids after casting mark, while looking like an Owl. Would ruin the game and also class fantasy.
---
&gt; This balancing destroyed class uniqueness and fantasy
---
Not at all. TBC elemental shaman was not the same class as shadow priest or mage or rogue. Ret paladin was not the same as warrior. Far moreso than Vanilla each class had a different playstyle (maybe WotLK was even better for this). Just compared to Vanilla, you had options for each role and each class had options as well. 
---
Most classes went from 1-2 possible specs (depending on role) in Vanilla to 2-3 in TBC. The mechanics used got significantly better and more interesting in doing so, both PvP and PvE. As combat got more complex the possibility of outplaying (and not outplaying = getting a crit) was more realistic. Probably the apex of this tradeoff in WoW was TBC to WotLK. WotLK took other game mechanics a bit far though.
---
&gt; Daily quests just as repetitive

No, quests are not as bad as killing the same mobs over and over, if only because there's multiple quests. Let alone farming dark iron ore say. Only downside is the time gating compared to being able to poopsock farm for days straight and therefore get ahead of the casuals. Many people were angry about rep gating generally but that's a separate issue.
---
&gt; Not comparable to epics by 'just running dungeons'
---
Literally what tier 0.5 is, and rep rewards are even entirely soloable if your complaint is the number of players needed. Heroics were fine in their place is the pre-raid progression. They didn't give loot better than the best craftables and worse than the intro raids. For someone complaining about 'shiny' you take your purple pretty seriously
---
Yes, but since quests are not marked on your map and you have to (gasp) *read the question for directions*, that doesn't guarantee everyone would find it.
---
As a software developer, I believe the reason for this is that Blizzard stores the name as case-insensitive. So BraveSirRobin is stored the same way as bravesirrobin. Whether it's stored as BRAVESIRROBIN or bravesirrobin I don't know. Likely they did that orginally to cut down on potential issues from mistyping names and to simplify DB queries.
---
The other effect of this is that you don't really have a capital first letter either. Blizz just makes the first letter caps and lowercase for the rest.

I think those 2 will end up on the same server due to their competition.  We can only be so lucky.
---
i mean... you could just.. not steam. sure you're losing tens of thousands of dollars... but I guess if thats the price you have to pay
---
Emerald Nightmare was definitely not "one of the most poorly received raids." People were disappointed because they liked the idea of a big open Emerald Dream zone, or an Emerald Dream themed expansion, but in terms of gameplay, challenge, encounter design, etc it was fairly well received. 
---
A Rotten Tomatoes style blurb for it might be: "A lot of wasted potential on a highly anticipated theme, but a great first raid for a new expansion."
---
I myself think the playerbase will dwindle to a stable point in two years. *And it's ok.*
---
It's not made to rule forever. No game should. Not even Super Smash Bros. Melee will and boy, do the fans try - even going against Masahiro Sakurai's desire for Melee to finally give way to all the other more recent versions of Super Smash Bros.
---
But Classic will still have a dedicated playerbase. The fans are lucky because this is a loved franchise and Classic is a good game even by today's standards. Other fanbases didn't have the same luck in this age of "game as a service'. Shit got deleted, dude.
---
The thing with Classic is: this game doesn't exist comercially anymore. I can find a copy of Melee to play. I can still find Super Mario 64 while Mario Odyssey is the current 3D Mario avaliable. But I can't find a copy of Classic. This is why it's so important for this game to be as close as possible from the real deal: Classic got finally *deleted* with Cataclysm's revamp.
---
This is not a game made to rule. And they won't pull the plug on it because there's a core fanbase that will continue to play it until they can't anymore. They just need to provide the basic support (tickets, etc) while people pay that monthly fee.
---
Esfands humor often involves baiting chat, playing dumb etc. I can see that people taking everything seriously might find him as an asshole. People who get his humor know that he is very knowledgeable about the game and one of the most down to earth, chill streamers out there.

Oh shit thats pretty cool. 
---
I suppose I'd be okay with additional level 60 zones like Silithus or EPL but itd be important for them to not be too strong. EPL and Silithus cant lose their value because Emerald Dream has better farming, higher ilvl mobs dropping better loot on average, easy mobs prone to AOEing, etc. 
---
It would need to be on par with the other max zones but not better, just a 3rd or 5th place to grind (depending on your definition of endgame zone).
---
Any time you’re in front of a gate/door waiting it for the store/concert/park doors to open. 
---
Flashbacks of waiting for WSG to start. A place that anyone grinding honor spent a lot of time staring at.
---
I have smaller hands, so I don't use the number keys for my main spells. I keep them on E, R, Q, F, G, Space Bar etc. Much easier for me to find shift + those keys. It's all about personal preference and comfort with keybindings.

---
I’ve heard people throwing their names around as good watches but haven’t personally seen so didnt want to recommend
---
&gt;I don't understand why people are wanting TBC
---
Just stop right there, read what you just wrote. TBC for me was the peak of World of Warcraft, it was like Vanilla on steroids. Walking through the Dark Portal for the first time, it was a lot of players first time playing the game (just like Vanilla was for others). I can 100% see why people want it. I'm hoping it wont be that hard for them to implement it eventually.
---
Because they don't is the reason.
---
Yep, high elves with those janky original high elf models. After TBC they were replaced with blood elf models, only with blue eyes instead of green.
---
I agree with all this but I would include I think that resilience really fucked up the class balance and flow of PvP.  It took the game away from sometimes bursts craziness to basically attrition and long term CC.  Resilience inevitably favors outlast classes more than others and I hated that.
---
Of all the quest addons out there you linked to one that isn’t even being updated for Classic
---
Didn't you read what I said ? Resilience isn't a magical stat, it doesn't make you invicible in PvP.  
---
For example, my rogue has PvE legs / one ring / one trinket which give me a total of 376 resilience (I'm mostly S2/S4), 376 resilience reduces crit damage on me by 19.08% and reduces your chance of crit against me by 9.54%, how insane do you have to be to believe that those % counter the difference between T6.5 and S0 ? It's not rocket science to understand that this piece [https://web.archive.org/web/20081005030348/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=35368](https://web.archive.org/web/20081005030348/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=35368) compared to this one [https://web.archive.org/web/20081005032551/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=34244](https://web.archive.org/web/20081005032551/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=34244) is far worse even for PvP, it's obvious you've never ever played to TBC
---
okay bud
---
So many whiners lmao
---
A very NSFW vid, and yet so funny.
---
We wont see Ice barbed Spear for a long long time tho. Phase 3?
---
It's another game in the Blizzard stable though, and if it keeps even a few people in their ecosystem it will be worth it. I haven't played any blizzard games in 2-3 years, but I'll definitely be back for classic. Who knows? it might pull me back into Hearthstone or convince me to finally get that D3 expansion I never got around to... You get the idea.
---
Yeah, I've been saying this. Look to the timeline of OSRS to see how this is all going to play out with Classic. Player Polling will come... and go.
---
For dps is a arms or fury spec better? What are the pros/cons?
---
&gt;New continent
---
A new continent doesn't necessarily have to be bad. It doesn't have to come with a level increase or be only for max level characters.
---
Perfect clip thank you for showing another clip that proves my point...
---
Common sense...Showing this desync clip...Look at him teleporting around trying to sync to the server right before that...
---
Everyone has experienced before that when a person is teleporting around it means they are lagging and trying to sync to the server. This is called a desync and you can count on every single player that's ever played WoW to understand this. Movement is a function of latency which syncs your character to where you are at. 
---
You've cleared made up your mind and are posting ALL the latency desync clips you can find on the internet. That's completely fine; you've searching far and wide for spilt second instances of clips where the range seems off in a library of 10000000s of hours of vanilla clips just to find a few instances of this desync.
---
Logic; you're trying to prove a rule with a few instances of odd things happening; that's because of latency; whereas all the clips in Vanilla's history show the actual range.
---
Resto Druid + Warlock or Resto Druid + Warrior... zzz
---
Correct.  There is no way an individual who makes that decision doesn't look at Classic's success and then look at the jump in population for TBC and go, "hmmm, that seems like a good idea".
---
Is it hard to level as prot? No.  Is it slower to level as Prot? Yes.
---
Both those facts aside if your not in any rush to do anything and was a unique toolkit of abilities Prot can let you have alot of fun.
---
Having Last stand early can literally be a lifesaver where you only need enough health to soak one more attack before you finish of your opponent.
---
Concussion Blow to have an on demand stun that rivals Paladins Hammer.
---
Shield Slam a move that in actuallity is less threat than a sunder armor and more expensive rage wise to boot but has the added effect that it can dispel a magic buff from a target whne used.  The effect isn't gaurentied but when it does work you can cause much mayhem with people in both PvP and PvE.
---
So yeah if speed isn't your thing anyways Prot can be really fun.
---
Sadly no but dam would it be a trip to run into the old crew again. 
---
So..
---
Faloni, Row, Blue...
---
You guys out there anywhere? It’s me, Havoc.
---
Who says they won’t increase the cap before release? More testing to be done.
---
How? :O
---
For levelling its pretty basic,  Str &gt; Stam &gt; Armor &gt; Agi.  You won't see many other stats until late game.  
---
Not super well versed on tanking but I'll take a stab at it.  My understanding is Defense Cap &gt; Hit soft-cap &gt; Weapon skill &gt; Damage stats if surviving well (Str &gt; AP &gt; Crit &gt; Agi) = Defensive stats if you aren't (Stam &gt; Dodge &gt; Block &gt; Parry).  Someone tell me what I got wrong here.
---
&gt; Here's two new races and it just so happens everybody gets pallies and shammies and a pretty class now. I'm not even a lore guy, I just thought it was cheap.
---
This feels like the opposite of what you are saying. They had game play reasons for giving both factions access to a class, and wrote lore around the how and why.
---
Adjusting game play for lore reasons would be the opposite - that lore already said that Blood Elf's were paladins and they had to compromise the game play to fit. But Blood Knights were built to fit gameplay and not the other way around
---
Wasn't a barrens chat thing. 
---
Chuck Norris and Mnakriks wife on the other hand....
---
I want to go to one of the streamer servers. Just seeing them giant armies they organize. I am ready for the WAAAAAAAAGH!!!!
---
Every clip of payo i've seen he's just whining like a bitch.
---
Even when I leveled as a Huntard, I'd be so thankful when a Druid gave my pet Thorns and MoTW. I know I didn't need it but it was so thoughtful to do to a class that most people don't care about.
---
I won't be rolling Hunter this time though since I really don't like not being able to give something back :(
---
Reverse gank is seeing some speedleveler trying to die on purpose, and healing them up and AoEing down all the mobs.
---
There were like seven plus Hoggers guarding the exit from Northshire Abbey last night too.
---
We were wailing, to no effect, on 'Thrall' last night. I was hitting him with my hammer and watching him one shot peeps. Then his target switched to me and I thought "Shit I better ", ded, "... rez."
---
wow... the only feed back from a massive list of ways to make money, is two people complaining about the technical uses of term arbitrage...
---
In the brokerage world, it would mean I'm buying from the Nuetral  Auction House and resaing to Horde or Alliance Aunction house.
---
However I was using them term in that you were buying goods from one market, Leveling and skillup market, and reselling to the Twink and raider market. Buying from the Long term no buyout market and reselling on the Instant buyout market..
---
America, Canada. Lots of places.
---
I enjoy the long shifts with multiple days off rather than 5-6 days on at 8 hours a day
---
Flying doesnt have to be a bad thing if done right. Aerial combat in AION was pretty cool. Maybe they can do a revamp of flying, allow people to use abilities and fight while mounted and flying in the air. Maybe make it so that stuns dismounts you and you fall to your death, would make flying risky.
---
U rich af
---
In retail the camera goes inside the kodo and you can see and click the mailbox. At least it did a while ago, I haven't played in a bit.
---
I don't think they're going to introduce new vanilla content, it would be kind of silly to. Maybe they'll do some silly PvP events or add a couple quest chains but I'm not expecting new raids or anything. Heroic dungeons of all the dungeons would go along way...but I'm not holding my breath. 
---
I hope that classic is a success and Blizzard has is able to analyze the data/community and use that as leverage to actually get funding to make a WoW sequel where they can rebuild the game from the ground up with a new engine in the likeness of classic. You can tell when playing retail that they are limited in what they can do by the game engine itself. Hopefully they can get retail into a nice position and scale all the old raids to the final level cap so that retail can live on for a while.
---
As long as you avoid Asmon and Soda's server. You'll be fine.
---
It's truly the little things. It really is. Something like that, which takes just a couple of seconds, can be such a cool thing.
---
He's good at wow too he just needs to STFU about stream sniping. Dude your surrounded by an army. Deal with the fucking assassins. lol
---
Also reincarnation
---
Pick a fun class to raid with, not a class to gear quickly.  Classic is perpetual, and even the biggest of scrubs will be in full tier 2.  Hell, maybe even T3.
---
It would be really nice if they had weekly stresstests with minor increase in level each time. It's been really fun making most out of it during the stress test despite being capped so low.
---
Yeah, the guy who said it's not worth the time hasn't fully remembered what Vanilla level pacing is like. You absolutely have to visit multiple zones in each level bracket, including the 10-20 bracket. You don't have to 100% them all, but if you just try to 100% Westfall and then go to straight to Redridge you're going to run out of doable quests, especially on harder-to-level classes like Rogue and Warrior.
---
That's not what he's saying at all, though. He's saying that if people want that stuff then why not introduce those features to Classic instead of bringing the negatives of TBC with it?
---
I had a specific question regarding warrior vs hunter duels. In the current beta does taunt/mocking blow/challenging shout work against a hunter's pet to have them break their own freezing trap? Is it possible to do this after a charge and before the trap triggers?
---
So, in TBC we got Dailies, Flying and Arena. All good on paper, but catastrophic in practice.
---
Can’t you get a mister title in game? You’d be mister mister t
---
Most of the larger streamers are trying to organize them all being on the same server. So I think you are thinking theirs going to be an issue when there wont be. It's in there best interest to all play on the same server so I doubt they will be spread out.
---
To be fair, I recall the only people on my server who ever achieved rank 14 in PvP were pretty organized about it themselves.  They all ran organised, premade groups and would take turns ensuring that the "correct" player for a certain time span earned the most honor so that they could pass the High Warlord title around and not have it stick to just one person.
---
Not as intricate as what was required from 40 mans to take down Kel Thuzad or CThuun, but it was there.
---
I forgot auto attacks were so powerful it’s not like warriors have literally ability after ability that generates threat. How was Pandaria as an introduction to wow for you?
---
I don’t think a board about video games is the best place to be educational. A lot of people just want to have fun, and edgy shittalking, especially in case of faction rivalry like the remark in context is part of it. Most of those people would likely help out a special needs person in a real life situation and would not consider that person simply as a “retard”.
---
buddy,. if you havent done at least 3 laps running around looking for either, you haven't truly experienced UC the way its meant to be.
---
Wtf how?
---
“Thanks sis, but I was really hoping for Classic...”
---
Oh I already have it down to 3 I wanna play, this is just a side project to kill time we've make it easier to pick between the 3. :)
---
reddit virgins put "thicc" on anything that is a woman
---
TBC had a lot of great aspects, but as fun as it was, flying as well as containing it entirely in it's own little pocket of level 60-70 stuff, including a (relatively) boring continent of a handful of zones surrounding a hub city that all relevant content in the game is now exclusive to was the absolute wrong formula to take for expansions.
---
That being said class specs, roles, item progression and stuff like that was the best it's ever been.
---
Also skinner box dailies were a mistake too, they were the worst thing to ever happen to the game. Today stuff like World Quests/Emmisaries are absolute cancer. If you want to gate progression do it like rested XP where it's a buff, don't do it with negative reinforcement/opportunity loss scenarios.
---
A variable unaccounted for means that it has not be solved. If you legitimately don’t know the value of a variable then the equation will clearly state it as a test or hypothetical or projection or estimate or something. 
---
Math is never wrong. If the DPS letter are not giving the correct number then they are not actually solving for damage per second. There is some other formula underneath that has been labeled incorrectly. 
---
It’s very simply.
---
I think they were eludi g to the fact that vanilla wasn't finished which is true the devs have said there was a ton more content that they just didn't have time to finish. Obviously Hyjal, Kara and a few other zones, MC was made in a week. mark Kern said on stream yesterday that they wanted like 20 races initially but had to pair it down due to time restrictions
---
It's basically just muscle memory.
---
I use F1-F4, 1-6, Shift +F1-Shift +F4 for spells/abilities and that pretty much covers most things I need to click regularly.
---
Everything else is 7-12 (spells/abilities used less often) or I just click on screen (food, hearth, random things).
---
I should add I use a Razer Naga so 1-12 are easily reached with my thumb.
---
When I first started using the Naga years ago it took sometime to get the feel for all the buttons, but now it's like second nature.
---
Yea,  after vanilla is when things started going down hill. We NEED to change the others to make them go uphill!
---
Madseasonshow, Venruki , and Pikabooirl are all great streamers without the huge ego.
---
This may help those looking to reconnect with old friends. I found 3 guildies here. 
---
https://www.vanillafriends.com
---
The question was player base though. Incorporating Activity was my mistake but even still unique accounts would be a better metric instead of a count of characters per account which isn't taken into consideration on that site, if one player makes 50 characters across 5 servers on EU/NA its will be represent as 50 on that site as long as they are part of an active guild that has a member that has posted on the AH or the character itself has posted on the AH.
---
Just pointing this out considering you took the time to have (sourced) in your original statement link to realm pop to give it more credence while it doesn't appear to have anything to do with the initial argument
---
This one is so important. I don't want them to tell me I'm the cool guy, while everyone else is also the cool guy. It is just so damn fake.
---
Scarab Lord was cool, because when that one person became a Cool Guy, it was real for the entire server, and not playing perspective tricks on players.
---
Anal [slam]
---
By expanding on the Classic Servers? People would be pissed off.
---
By creating separate tBC Servers? This one would be better imo, because there isn't much overlap between Classic fans and tBC fans. But this wouldn't be a Expansion for Classic. It would be a separate game.
---
Which of the three will look the coolest?
---
Decision made.
---
personally i press ctrl with the middle/root of my pinky finger (it sort of goes diagonally to the button, try it). then ctrl+1,2,3,4 is easy to press. and alt with the thumb. and only shift with the tip of my pinky. 
---
also bind modifiers to all movement keys. thats very convinient binds. 
---
like alt+w. and you can use it for abilities that you use statically. for instance i used to have alt+w as bandage keybind, cos you need to stop anyways. alt+a,s,d,q,w,e are a cool convinient binds aswell. also you dont need to press buttons simultaneously, you press modifier first, you can even hold it for a moment and then the key. maybe thats what you meant anyways but whatever.
---
Also for me i don't really need to find these buttons, my pinky is always laying on the ctrl and shift. so you dont even need to find them, you just press it what's already under your finger.
---
Adding to this, when I use Q and E for spells I rebind strafe left and right to A and D
---
Hood up and asking the real questions. Respect
---
Mix of everything, there's no single answer. The gathering tradeskills (Mining/Leatherworking/Herbalism/shards from enchanting) are great ways to make money through the auction house. 
---
Certain mobs drop crafting materials that will also sell well on AH. 
---
Certain mobs will drop higher than average cash, or vendor loot. 
---
Some people will try their hand at WoWCapitalism 1.0 and make their dosh by flipping/playing the AH itself.
---
"Which is the best one, though?" Super complex answer the involves your class, your level, your tradeskills, your servers economy as a whole, and the time you play at. There's no good way to figure it out outside of trying your hand at a few and seeing how much gold/hour you make.
---
There's a ton of room to make the "bad" specs better with gear designed for them.
---
Okay its abundantly clear that you didn't actually play Wrath more than 1 month.  They were very well balanced.
---
I thought anybody who rang the gong within the same day as the first person rang gets the mount.
---
Maybe its different in classic because of server size or something, but before I stopped playing retail I played on Asmons server for quite a while and never noticed anything out of the ordinary compared to the plethora or other servers I've played on. In fact the only time I even knew that we shared a server is because our MT got in a pug M EN with him once.
---
I'll avoid big streamer servers if I can, but if I can't I'm not that worried about it. It seems to be being blown out of proportion.
---
For most of these people, streaming has become their livelihood and primary source of income. I don't think it's as simple as asking them to quit their job.
---
Their animations are good. It'll be interesting to see what people do.
---
Venruki is also super grateful for his viewers and it makes it genuinely enjoyable to watch him
---
Again, numbers made up for the sake of keeping things simple, but not necessarily, no. The "final" version of the server won't have a 3k cap like the initial layers do, and those layer caps will increase over time anyway. They may well end up with "final" servers with 5k people on rather than 3k. High population is what they want, on as few servers as possible, to avoid any merges which suck. There IS the potential that not enough people leave and you have so many on one server that you need to look at things like dynamic spawns or whatever, but the likelihood that the majority of the population doesn't quit within a few months is very low. We have a dedicated community here (some people here clearly hate the game but are still going to play it), but a LOT of people will try it and hate it. Hell, there's people on official forums who've been playing since 2004 launch and lasted 10 minutes in the beta.
---
true but an actual mafia requires too many people working in too obvious a way. they will get themselves banned if they are actually effective.

Did you beg for money or something? 😅
---
I played a resto druid during TBC and can tell you they were the most overpowered healer in the game. Both in PVP and in raids, rejuvenation and lifebloom were *broken*.
---
Also, I never said I was a hardcore plauer, it took me months to get to 42 and i knew nothing of gear, as a hunter I still had the leather chest that dropped in deadmines. My point was more so that nostalgia isnt the only reason for classic demand. Im not sure how i can prove to you that i played then but i do ill let you know
---
Sleeping on my boy pikaboo for rogue?!
---
These comments are a lark, but on topic druid consistently has the lowest pop % regardless of faction. Most of the rest have fairly similar % except warrior that's way out in front.
---
I guess I get it in theory. I don't watch a lot of streamers but the few I've seen think they know a lot more than they actually do. 
---
I mean consider we're going back in time to a place where you can only role Druid on 2 races: Night Elf or Tauren. 
---
I could be completely out of touch, but by the time AQ is dropping there's going to be burn out / some streamers falling by the way side because it's obvious they don't know what they're talking about...
---
What is behind Chuck Norris' beard? \[Krol Blade\]

Years ago I rebound the movement keys. So now 'S' is forward and 'X' is back. I forget what 'X' used to be or where I bound that ability to. 'A' and 'D' are strafe left and right. Nowadays I can't play with a normal WASD setup.
---
Anyway that gave me the whole row of 'Q' to 'Y' to use for abilities. So all my most common abilities are in that row, less common are '1'-'6'. And utility functions are Alt. I rebound one of my mouse buttons to be Alt.
---
I don't think they will since Soda will be on a PvP server and, iirc, Asmon said he will be on a PvE.
---
Couldn’t agree more!
---
i think they will just launch TBC and people will have to deal with it. plenty of people think TBC is better than vanilla
---
Soda said he'd want to roll on Asmongold's server because that's the only way the factions would be somewhat balanced.
---
I can't comment on pvp. I have never reached the same heights in pvp as I have in raiding so all I can do is but defer to your opinion and venruki in this matter
---
Chuck Norris hit 60 on the closed beta.
---
Nobody saw him as he was busy kicking his way through Naxxramas. Oh and by the way, Kel Thuzad was an easy fight!

I'm talking about private servers. Nobody knew the mechanics back during Vanilla. People wore the wrong gear, didn't bring the full list of consumables (or any at all in some cases) and people were just generally much worse at the game back then compared to now. Most of the bosses in AQ40 are tank &amp; spank with mechanics on par with/worse than modern day raid finder. There isn't really anything impressive about Naxx either, outside of the four horsemen and maybe KT. There won't be any trouble clearing AQ40 &amp; Naxx in Classic. There's already guilds planning their MC runs as soon as they hit level 60 on Classic. Rag will be down within 2 weeks of the game launching by people in greens &amp; blues.

Thank you! I had no idea something like this even existed

Please report it. You shouldn’t be able to tame any beast higher level than you.

Edit: unless you’re on actual beta and were level 11.
---
Sorry man, I just work in the securities industry and it’s misused very frequently. 
---
The advice itself was very good. 
---
Yeah, It’d be like buying from the AH to immediately resell to a vendor for more, or buying on alliance AH to resell to horde on neutral AH due to differing demand. 
---
Buying to sell in the same market at a later point in time at a higher value, due to appreciation, would be the classic definition of investing. 
---
Again, sorry for being pedantic. Good advice regardless.
---
In that case look out for Lionheart helm and Titanic leggings! GL!

looks like lion king kind of off-putting

The best gaming experiences I've ever had in my life. One of the best just in general, not even gaming related.
---
Why are characters so pixelated
---
Actually, I think describing classic WoW as a 'passion project' is fairly accurate. Classic probably costs them very little to work on, and the expectations are low. It is a great PR move, it keeps people paying for WoW subscriptions, and it satisfies the call for 'Vanilla'. Don't expect more than that.
---
I don't have any problems quickly finding modifiers with my left hand but I've been doing this for way too long.
---
Actually Sodapoppin is super chill these days. I don't know why you think he's insufferable.
---
I mean, maybe it's just you.
---
Although I agree about Asmongold, that guy is a total sketch bag. Why people give that guy money is beyond me. He ninja loots shit, he eats little cakes with maggots crawling all over them. He hasnt cleaned his room in 800 years... He's just a shitty person. To him, it's all about him, and I hate that. He doesn't care about a single person but himself.
---
But again... 8 years ago Soda poppin might have been an annoying little shit, but these days he's super chill, he's an extremely skilled PVPer and he doesnt act like a total asshat anymore.
---
But honestly, by the way you're writing things, it seems like itd be hard to please you. I'd say just keep opening streams and going down the list until you find something you enjoy.
---
Plus at level 40 you'll likely want to go Arms for MS. It's a game changer.
---
Save your mana. I often time click both off when I notice them. It's just useless buff clutter. Of course I play undead so thats a factor too.
---
Well it's a good thing clips are representative of the entire stream otherwise your opinion would be kinda shit
---
Randomly when I run around questing and share buffs with others, I always put thorns on the Hunter pets and voidwalkers. No reason not to. They're the ones getting hit.
---
"Don't Stop Me Now" by Queen. It was tradition in our guild that somebody play it over Ventrilo after defeating Majordomo Executus while we were running to the Ragnaros chamber.
---
Similarly, "The Final Countdown" by Europe. Someone started playing it over Ventrilo when we got to 5% on Onyxia during our first ever kill of her. Shortly after, Blizzard forced us to rename our guild, so we became &lt;Final Countdown&gt;.
---
All subs are toxic*
---
There ya go
---
The rounding off is exactly the reason. That said, it's difficult to quantify or think about without trying it.
---
Having played Warrior in Vanilla I 100% would never have a build without Anger Management, be it PVP, DPS or tanking. It just feels too good in too many little situations. Rage is so critical to a warrior.
---
I dont agree with Imp Hamstring about each point being less valuable than the last. It's about consistancy. 5%, 10%, 15% chance to proc. 3 points in imp HS will proc the bind 3 times as often as someone spamming imp HS with only 1 point in it. Yes, it's RNG, but the difference between 10% and 15% is 1 in 10 vs 1 in 6.
---
Obviously you're free to use whatever build you want, but I think you'll struggle to find any guide or competant warrior PvPer who would chose a measly 2% damage over the above two talent points. You're not going for damage meters, you're going for reliability and burst, and that means having consistant resources to use your skills, and keeping things under control so you can hit them.
---
You're not alone
---
Well I thought you were asking my opinion and then you were gonna share your thoughts like a normal conversation but I forgot what website I was on.
---
I did play Wrath, it didn’t take a genius to see that DKs were overbloated with abilities and it shows if you look at the top 3s comps 2500+ for the first 2 patches which lasted much longer than “1 month”.
---
Have a good day pal
---
I think my first 60 was 14 or so days played.. so given I know a lot more I assume I will take a bit less now, but 240 hours is the min I think it will take. That would be 30 days at 8 hours a day.
---
That outburst queen needs a good slapping.

Chuck Norris went skydiving twice. The first time he caused the cataclysm, the 2nd time was to undo it.
---
I can understand supporting TBC, but Wrath I don't get at all. I get that people love Ulduar, but one raid doesn't make a good expansion.
---
imagine if he had said cooking
---
AAAHHHHHHHH!
---
Most classic supporters do not.
---
I was considering warrior but didn't want to be part of the overwhelming majority. Warriors are typically the most prevalent class in classic right?

Blizzard has partnerships with Twitch, I would imagine that gives them a significant amount of pull.
---
Twitch would of course always have the right to not act.
---
But one streamer over a lucrative business partnership? Who do you think wins out?
---
Tank for hire can have both positive and negative effects on your server reputation.
---
If you are a clumsy tank that results in slow or even failed runs your value and stock will diminish.
---
If you are a master tank that is well known for quick, effective, successful clears your stock will increase.
---
Selling yourself as a mercenary is very hard work but can be very lucrative if you are capable.
---
&gt;I main hunter and if someone gives me a buff you better believe whatever mob I see them fighting is getting a serpent sting or raptor strike
---
Which is why I really hope they revert the mobtagging change. If you were to "help" like that in Classic you will just lower the amount of XP that player gets from the mob.
---
Everyone who completes the Q chain in 10h gets the mount, so they will probably do it all together.
---
Idk if that's the official reason but draenei weren't around when I started so that was the reason I thought of
---
You’re welcome, please share if you find any old besties. It would make my heart so happy. The ones I’m looking for the most are no where to be found.
---
At least soda isn't hitting his desk with his foot.
---
people are still on the beta high. Its going to take a year for people to be more realistic about vanilla
---
lol you say that like you don't care but you still deleted your original comment...
---
Hes really good and not a man child
---
I’m more tired of seeing people saying “what should I main?” Main whatever you think will be cool main something that you’ve never played try them all hell.
---
fans cant trade you BIS gear, unless the level 30 meta all BIS is BOE
---
So many reasons:  
---
1) it fucked up balance dramatically and was a big contributor to the RPS balancing not working.  It made attrition based classes and heals way too good, while it made bursty classes terrible by comparison.
---
2) it largely split the community because it was so necessary for PvP.
---
3) it didn't make sense in game from an immersion point.  Why would armor be drastically better against other players but not against non player characters?  
---
4) it didn't make sense in terms of lore how arena was implemented.  There is something intrisicly that makes sense about PvP rewards in vanilla, like your faction rewarding you in the war effort.  In TBC it was just "hey this new arena thing and they somehow have all this epic gear to hand out depending on your ranking!"
---
5) the focus on arena for PvP rewards was also bad, because it was imo not in the spirit of WoW.  Suddenly BG's hardly matter and in order to get that PvP effectiveness you had to be one of the 3 chosen classes because of the format.  Compare that to BG's where every class has some sort of niche they can do.  
---
A lot of my complaints are about arena, and yeah I conflate that with resil, but I think resilience really fucked up PvP.
---
Lmao I’ll definitely give you that
---
For me as well. Hopefully I’ll rediscover the magic.
---
I’ve been in contact with one of the last still existing members of my old guild that has been around since launch about coming back. Hoping to see more of my raiding buddies popping back up too.
---
Well he isn't a dev for Blizzard.  He's just a disgruntled ex.

Didn’t the cosmos Ui add on have a very low quality quest helper built in?
---
I remember my first time playing Vanilla WoW and I was just roaming around as a low level Warrior and a level 60 character with badass armor and a mount was coming by and he stopped randomly , gave me a buff and I was so ecstatic even though I had no idea what the hell it was 
---
It’s those little courtesies that made the game so cool because he didn’t have to nor did I ask him to but it really immersed you in the game and showed you that people are willing to help and do small gestures to make you feel welcome to a new game
---
Pretty sure that the group leader can kick a player from the group. And since the tank is usually made the leader (so he/she can mark the mobs for the pull), it would be easy to kick the hunter. If tank doesn't have lead, ask for lead to mark mobs with skull/triangle/diamond/etc, then kick then hunter if hunter still refuses to remove aspect of the pack.
---
I'd rather vanilla class design. It felt like you were playing a class rather than a spec.
---
I found that to be an outlier. Other than that hes been awesome. But that stream snipe thing was strange
---
I'm sorry but I noticed you made the following comment elsewhere 30 minutes ago:  
---
&gt; Aaah my dude, you can only level up so many times without feeling the burnout. Leveling in WoW could be the most extraordinary activity of mankind and you still would find it awful after doing it as much as someone with full heirlooms does. 
---
Yet you claim there will be a core of players large enough to keep Blizzard invested that wont burn out? I know that for some of us Classic is beyond the most extraordinary activity of mankind but I still don't believe there will be enough players in (let's say) 5 years to keep them from pulling the plug. And I'd think it more likely from a company like Blizzard to expand upon it rather than just calling it quits.
---
DUDE I completely forgot he had beta! Added 100%. I had some good fights against him in world when they were attacking duskwood.
---
I definitely will. I don’t have much hope of finding the old crew again because they moved to a different realm at the start of WOTLK but dam it would be good to see them again
---
Level as feral, you will thank me later. As long as you have a healing set (remember you can use cloth) and can easily heal up to your low to mid 50s. Depending on the group, your skill, and your healing set you can heal up to 60 as well.
---
I leveled my priest as shadow and didn't switch to holy full time until my mid 50s just due to personal preference.
---
I had a druid alt that was feral until 60 and again healed just fine.
---
And I had an arms war that tanked just fine till the mid 50s (obviously swapped to 1h/shield when tanking)
---
This seems so overblown. The only issue will be faction balance. If the streamers are on opposite factions there are no additional issues that don’t just come naturally on a high population server. Who cares if some random guy gets given gold, it doesn’t effect you. 
---
All the extra organized events are just a Benefit or neutral if you avoid them.
---
Gotta agree with the guy that said str and Stam priority. Agility is not a priority for warr, it technically isn't useless but str and stam will be more useful while leveling as a warrior
---
Agree that feels terrible but how do you bring new players into the game without it? Tbc maybe but at some point catch-up is impossible. Wow was still growing then, quickly.
---
Yes and no, I'm hoping they group up bit imagine the population then? It wouldn't hold :') But yeah there aren't 40 huge streamers either, you should find a safe haven, but people are still worried about being unlucky on their choice
---
kinda funny that some people dislike sttreamers for raging/being obnoxious, yet some of the most famous oldschool WoW vids are people raging and being obnoxious
---
Asmon beltittles someone in game ...what a dick

on the flip side,

---
Yeah ss/hs are easy to come by if you run imp soul drain so it's good for makin frens
---
There are quite a few people who are pretty delusional about the leveling experience from vanilla. That delusion being that it was something that one took their time with, and savored it, like a cup of hot cocoa on a cold winter's day.
---
The very fact that Joana's guides existed directly combats that fiction. The race to level cap was just as prevalent in vanilla as it is today.
---
I've seen quite a few people mention that anyone who "races to 60" doesn't belong in classic, and should be barred from playing it. I wouldn't put it past those people to collectively make false reports to get this type of content removed.
---
Revisionist history has been rampant these last few years.
---
Just do TBC style talent/ability improvements BUT no outlands or flying or any of the other shit that took away from classic.
---
He was never good, he's still clicking and backpedaling even to this day. Just being unemployed so you could put in more time shouldn't give you some kind of prestige 15 years later. Stop making this about privateservers, it's so cringeworthy when you're trying to gatekeep something you played when you were in your teens.
---
which is funny because sonii has a manlet nerds face on a bodybuilder body
---
not from who i talked to (and me)
---
Yeah, you can go through a tunnel in the southwest of Ashenvale to get to the Keeper/Dryad area at the top of Stonetalon and there are quite a few quests there.
---
Great place to go if you want some low-level world PvP, less crowded and less danger of high level gank squads than Hillsbrad.
---
chat is global " /2 PLS INV ASMON LAYER"
---
Yeah thats what I figured. How much worse is ret pally compared to arms warrior? I wanted to use a 2h but not if the class blows lol
---
Small streamers are more my jam. HighWarlordStino is super funny. MrShiny64 is also a great laid-back streamer. I'll pick these guys over the top popular streamers any day of the week.
---
Well, if you check his post history then it kind of makes sense. He's a regular at r/IncelsWithoutHate, lmao
---
I think that's probably why I like him, I'm pretty sarcastic myself lol.
---
Yea for sure
---
Awesome to hear, and i'm sorry about Jon. 
---
You'll have to recreate all your great times together in old Azeroth in his memory.
---
Yeah just started watching him, he's great
---
Lol imagine being that sensitive to words wtf. “Those types of people” lmao
---
It doesnt do that at all
---
I hope you enjoy your new experience of casual wow :D
---
If only they'd all roll on the same server. I like watching their streams from time to time but Asmon, Soda, Tips, Esfand, etc. will bring nothing positive to a server. Itd be easiest if there was only one plagued server to avoid.
---
People only pay attention to him because he helped enable gamergate
---
No i was in the stress test level 10. I got en error message when i tried to tame a level 13, which was orange. But it let me tame 12, 11, 10. Not sure if thats how it was in vanilla. The tooltip doesnt say anything about level. When i tried to tame the level 13 it did tell me that it was too high level.
---
If you want to look at an extreme example, if you have 95% crit without axe spec, that additional 5% will do basically nothing.  You're probably going to crit every attack on someone until they die.
---
If you only have 5% crit, well axe spec DOUBLES your crit chance.  
---
If you have 30% crit, a majority of crits you do would statistically have happened even if you had 25%.  Sword spec just opens up a new avenue for extra damage.
---
Strictly speaking in terms of dps, each additional point of crit is worth less than the previous point unless you have some insane crit synergy (like rolling ignites)
---
Incorrect. Blizzard has confirmed that you cannot add people on the opposite faction via Battlenet on PvP servers
---
I mean, that's essentially what Kern is saying. Utilize the TBC assets but keep WoW in the "essence" of Classic. This probably pertains to exactly what you mentioned that needs to change: dailies, flying mounts, absolutely abysmal itemization, and I also hated queuing for BG's in the safety of your city. Make people go out into the world to queue again. 
---
I definitely love Vanilla and undoubtedly want something MORE at the end of phase 6. That being adding content to Classic itself or progressing to TBC. The dream would be progress to TBC but reimagined without the stupidity of the aforementioned.
---
TBC was an excellent expac... and it could be even better.
---
ur still mad trump won
---
Does classic have regular full screen back? I cannot get gsync to work properly with Windowed fullscreen in retail. Gsync indicator is on but definitely not as buttery smooth as it should be. Even with vsync and gsync enabled in NVCP.
---
Hi, /u/sy7vos
---
VC or diremaul
---
Hi, /u/Weelah
---
Very nice. Gratz! (Yeah Blizz just give us beta, pls)
---
Fury is MILES better than arms for DPS in PVE. Arms is really not suitable for coming to a Raid as DPS, it's a pure PVP spec. The only way you'll do competitive damage as Arms is if you vastly outgear other players in the raid. If you PvP as arms and come as an arms spec then you'd better either be swinging a Nightfall or primarily be an offtank for the raid - in fact, there's a fairly popular spec that was 31/5/15 which gave enough prot talents to tank nicely in raids and enough pvp talents to do PvP fine.
---
Fury is fairly poop for PvP though, it can be done if you really outgear people to the point of two shotting them but that's unlikely. It does do incredibly good DPS though, some of the best of any class once you get nice gear.
---
If you don't care about PvP and you just want to do dps, Fury is the way to go. However, even as Fury spec you WILL be expected to tank as a Warrior, mostly in levelling dungeons but often in raids as an offtank if an encounter needs multiple tanks, so dont expect to be able to play warrior without tanking ever.
---
Thanks friend ❤ I appreciate your comment
---
&gt;Knowledgeable: Esfand
---
Lmaooo, the guy was a joke on private servers, got hard carried by his guild, still backpaddle in 2019, complains about PvP on a PvP server and now chase asmongoloid as his pirate parrot.
---
Don't watch this clown.
---
Imagine if they added a new dungeon or entry-level raid with a libram that gives paladins a taunt ability, people would absolutely run raids for unique gear like that.
---
Importantly: 
---
* Gnomes also make great warriors for alliance because of their racial escape artist. A warriors biggest challenge often will be mobility and sticking on its target. Escape artist enables the warrior to stay on its target.
---
DPS PvE, i'll be leveling w a hunter so not too much to worry about there.
---
I played pretty casually during Vanilla and my 1st character (priest) took around 10 days /played.
---
My 2nd character (feral druid) was closer to 7 I believe. The first time will generally be slow as your learning the game and figuring things out.
---
My 3rd alt a warrior (arms) took me closer to 9 days simply because I went prot in my early 50s because I really enjoyed tanking and decided to stick out the last few levels as a legit tank.
---
The Vanilla experience wasn't really about hitting 60 then doing things. The main part was leveling itself, then doing things.
---
Right, shouldn't be such a big deal with clutter once people reach 10-15 and start dispersing to their preferred zones. Starter areas get cluttered in the beginning by design.
---
I gotta say, running around the stress test competing for boars and scorpids and such was really refreshing. I can remember many a time starting a new orc/troll and the area is mostly empty. Nice to see it so full of boar-killing life.
---
I'm still screwing around with stuff, but IIRC the upgrade to MotW is a non-trivial upgrade and basically mandatory for grouping content.  Even going with something like [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/AxwwQATPNzzdAeQ](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/AxwwQATPNzzdAeQ) something's got to give, as you can't take Omen of Clarity, Leader of the Pack and sink 10 points into resto.
---
Granted, it's been a very, very long time since I've played vanilla, so this is going off of memory and not looking at a more recent build from one of the private servers.
---
He can play anonymously like everyone else, just create an alt and don't stream it?
---
No, SB is definitely the spam spell you cast repeatedly until your CoS are is original you need to slap another corruption on since you won't be using Immo a whole lot early on or blasting shards with SF or SBurn, banishing, coiling, fearing, rotating demons, yada yada.
---
There's not much going on in PvE in a raid setting for just about any class, no. Shadowbolt spam is pretty much a decent reduction of the "rotation".
---
Oh! There's summoning, saccing and stones, yes. So that's a few more buttons you can push out of combat. Maybe some detect invis in the ruins in Undercity, too.
---
Vanilla PvE Raiding wasn't very complex from an ability standpoint. PvP made you work with just about everything.
---
So yeah, looks like you don't know how to play a Warlock much.
---
This is where i afk, i wonder if i can fish in there
---
I think he may be trying to be funny intelligence/smart ass. Maybe ?
---
No you’re supposed to run around endlessly. It’s the classic way!
---
That, and instead of spending time leveling, he spent all his time trading and making money.
---
Normally, it would be a pretty large waste of time to start farming cash at low levels, and because everyone out levels that gear so quickly it doesn't really become valuable to trade as there are better sources of income.
---
Still quite impressive to get 95g at level 10 in a limited timeframe.
---
The problem is it's one thing keeping the art assets. But they'd need to refactor all of the gear and items to fit the vanilla philosophy. And the more changes they have to make to existing code, the closer they get to p**sing off the retail player base who begin to question if content for the current game is suffering in favour of development hours for the old one. I'm not saying Blizzard couldn't handle that situation. But it's one they'd be very aware of.
---
Ahaha, human warriors will be everywhere! If Alliance I would go Dwarf ;)
---
Some cant handle the truth
---
&gt; Chuck Norris doesn't need items. The items need Chuck Norris 
---
This one is not that bad :)
---
It was a blast, pretty much played WSG constantly for the most part of the stresstest lol.
---
I don't bind strafe. You can just use A and D plus RMB to strafe. So standard WASD is all you need.
---
I always portal in to UC at the same spot(Mage Quarters) then, by "muscle memory", walk all the way to either the FP or Inbox and always get it backwards.
---
Oh ret is way worse 
---
Warrior dps is considered the best in game by many people, it's strong from the moment you hit 60 until AQ and naxx, seriously they are beasts. Many consider vanilla to be the age of the warrior.
---
Ret is pretty shit in raids, like you'll be lucky to be middle of the pack on the dps meters.
---
Ive never heard this before
---
There are lots of warriors but GOOD warriors are rare. If you want to tank and dont really care about pvp or dps then a good well-geared skilled Prot Warrior is still super super rare and you'll be in demand.
---
If you just want to PvP as Arms though, you'll be lumped in with a large amount of players and will struggle to get noticed in PvE.
---
What would it offer that this sub doesn’t already offer?
---

Good for 2 patches, wooow incredible.  We've never seen that ever, oh wait...  
---
&gt;it didn’t take a genius to see that DKs were overbloated with abilities  
---
Less abilities than Hunter, Shaman, Paladin, Druid, Priest, probly more.  At least try to make sense.
---
Fuck yeah, or NE.
---
I hate that I might sell out and go human lol
---
Dwarves were my first toons I love em
---
Mankriks wife
---
This is a great comment too, i personally discount them as I despite them but EA is amazing. Gnome warr with Engineering would be the best choice for PvP imo.
---
That'll get pretty stale after Naxx has been out for a year or two.
---
Haha.
---
I never even played vanilla wow. I started at the back end of TBC but only spent my time levelling, it was WOTLK where I learned to do dungeons and eventually started raiding, yet here you are making incorrect presumptions of me, well done.
---
My thought process is simple: It is not possible for Blizzard to release a server for each expansion, so classic is better than nothing right? It is a good start, a step in the right direction.
---
I am truly sorry that the demand was for classic and not TBC, maybe you should go off and make a movement for TBC servers, maybe your movement will get blizzard to do it, good luck.
---
In the mean time we have classic and I see classic as a great opportunity to not only revitalise the game but, eventually, to do something a little different and not make the same mistakes, not tread the same exact path.
---
I dont want to deprive you or anyone, I want classic to not only be accommodating to the TBC fans but also to work for them and keep them in mind when it comes to deciding how to prolong classics life and I think its possible to do that without fracturing the player base, raising the cap to 70 and taking people away form azeroth.
---
Most of these people watch a clip or two and instantly dislike them. They don't really understand that Asmongold and Sodapoppin are some of the biggest advocates for classic wow. They also don't really get that both of them put on a "show" for the stream. They're entertainers, and a lot of people think that's just an excuse for their behavior. It's a pretty complex thing to follow, but in simplistic terms, it's just a hivemind thing at this point.
---
Corruption and you can throw Death Coil/Shadow Burn while moving, or you can use them to proc a crit over another lock's shadowbolt.
---
Found the noob
---
Dont listen to the guy below, those can both save your life in wpvp servers
---
Why does it have T1 rogue as BiS when most of it is worse than the pre raid?
---
You can't compare the impact a streamer will have in vanilla to their impact on retail. With all the sharding and cross-server stuff on retail, you obviously won't notice their presence. But trust me they will absolutely ruin whatever server they play on for anyone who's not a fan of them or in their guild.
---
Many choices to make but if you want to go HOTW at 60 you could simply start speccing that way once you hit 40.  But you really should at least get leader of the pack in Feral, then start going down resto maybe?  Furor is a solid talent either way for feral droods, and there are other talents (aside from the quicker healing touch) that are decent for Ferals as well such as improved enrage, reflection and insect swarm.  
---
That being said if you're going for maximum "kill mobs as easily as possible" ability to 60 you're probably better off just going into balance for OOC and then finishing off with a few extra points in feral + furor as you get to 60.
---
Please stop with these post. They won’t make new content for classic. People want classic for classic. Not for the feeling of classic.
---
Yeah, I love them and hyped to play it so bad! I also enjoy Tirisfal too which is a bonus. Hit 10 in the stress test and it felt quite fast compared to Elwynn, but I never liked Fargodeep aha.
---
 Corruption and you can throw Death Coil/Shadow Burn while moving, or you can use them to proc a crit over another lock's shadowbolt. 
---
Look like you don't know how to play the lock class mate...
---
this pun had me in brambles
---
*Vivid memories of leveling as balance back in 1.3*
---
Sorry, I think I just had a Vietnam flashback of trying to cast hurricane on targets to kill them.  Druids were nothing like Diablo 2 windy / fire druids in early WoW. If only someone could have warned me.
---
&gt; Yet you claim there will be a core of players large enough to keep Blizzard invested that wont burn out? 
---
My comment on that post was in a completely different context.
---
The kind of player who keeps a retro game alive (and Classic is one) is the guy who would level up ten characters, and after it's done, this player would start ten more. They *really* enjoy the game. This is the core playerbase of any old game - players who like it more than any other game to the point they keep playing it for whatever reason. Once the population is reduced to those core players (and let's not be naive here: there are at least ten-thousands of Classic fans), they'll start speedrunning or leveling through specific quirky ways or whatever. The "endgame" meta will keep evolving to keep those core players happy in a frozen, final version of Classic.
---
I've seem my own brother do more than 15 runs of Dark Souls (the first one), each with a different character, because he simply likes it. There will be people like him for WoW Classic. If Blizzard expands onto that, they'll take away the game from that core, fanatic playerbase, as they did once tBC launched.
---
He dual wields two sulfuras and TF on ranged slot
---
1.) No Layering, I know it's in beta, but I haver zero faith in blizzard to pioneer this technology and get it right in time for classic. I would accept sharding through 1-20 at this point.   
---
2.) No Cross realm BGs - I always liked having faction rivals. I recall getting ganked by a dick in STV. Was so satisfying when I met him on an AB and absolutely rolled him in a fair 1v1   
---
3.) Maybe client side transmog so if I end up fury i'm not stuck running around looking like a clown. - Absolutely no server-side transmog though.
---
yeah no aotp
---
Interesting. Never heard this quote before. Is that the same Brakk from Space Ghost: Coast to Coast? Truly epic
---
Regarding Battle Shout—
---
Do we know how it is going to function yet? My understanding is it isn’t generating threat as it was prior to 2.0.1.... I.e. difficult to use for AOE threat in 5-mans. Has anyone seen if blizzard commented on this?
---
I’d love to AOE tank in 5-mans with my group of friends, but I may switch to bear tank as my main if AOE threat is going to be an issue while leveling.
---
Any thoughts or recommendations?
---
Makes me wonder about this “deep seeded social community” that everyone is nostalgic about.
---
As a warrior what profession should I grab lvling? I think I might have farmer alt then having alch and bs on warrior is that a good idea?
---
And my up axe!
---
I think just the Swifty wannabe's will be Night Elf tbh :D Although you watch me get jumped by a bunch of Nelf warriors in SM... Karma's a bitch
---
yea lots of level 30 hunters running around with lv 32 pets in full beta
---
Basically, the only time you'll regret going warrior is while leveling. Once you get to 60 it's just Faceroll, huge dps in raids and group PvP is a joke, if you have a healer you're a wrecking ball. Sorry thought I'd add this .
---
The game changes man, and you have to understand that not wearing a shield is only to increase the limit placed on dps by TPS. Threat is a system put in place in order to control the amount of damage done, and is an artificial ceiling which throttles better players. Raising that ceiling has allowed greater expression in the game, and is healthy. If it doesn't fit with your character fantasy of a warrior tanking with a shield, then don't play that way. However, you can't force other players to go along with your view, and DW tanking is just another style of playing.
---
Pvp they can be fun and competitive. They make good supports if you are willing to heal your comrades in between dmg. But as far as pve they are very low on dps. You wont be competitive in raids unfortunately. Have of their skills just aren't useful against a boss or in pve. But in pvp they can utilize more of their kit
---
How do we know he doesn't do that already?
---
&gt; Classes buffed / nerfed because of Arena.
---
This was pretty bad, fair.
---
&gt; Removal of 40 men raids.
---
I'm not sold 40 man is objectively better than 25. If you have arguments I'd love to hear them, but I haven't seen any convincing ones yet. That also doesn't mean they're worse, I'm just not convinced they're inherently better.
---
&gt; AoE Paladin tanks and Bears.
---
A great example of a good thing TBC brought. As it turns out, having different classes be good at different things while still viable is pretty good. 
---
Yes, the game will change, but it will need to if it's going to thrive. Even if you think Vanilla was the peak of the game, it wasn't perfect and has plenty of things that need finishing. Sure, give it some time to breathe, but look at the runescape model and how good that has been for that community.
---
Why is enchanting not useful?

You’d work great for the media, /u/NZBound11.
---
There is for npcs, just bind 'Interact With Target' or something to that effect in the key bindings menu and /tar the npc in question.
---
Pretty sure it won't give threat. AOE tanking with threat can be pretty tricky, as it was in 1.12
---
This is what Classic is all about. All the polar bears in the world but this one meant more to this man and he struggled to find it and he did. nice job man.
---
Because while McGruff would be ok, most people would use it for ridiculous names.
---
You're insane to say there's absolutely no parallels between OSRS and Classic.
---
Remember the d scim and abyssal whip?
---
Are they still BiS? No.
---
Are they still widely used and iconic to the game? Yes.
---
Jagexs approach to adding new content without invalidating old content is exactly how WoW Classic needs to be approached.
---
to early
---
me :)
---
I think there is a distinction between speeding things up and bypassing.
---
ZG and Dire Maul are catch up done right. I think turning up the knob on how much loot older raids drop could be a good way to catch up.
---
I remeber a friend complaining about getting a green upgrade from a raid helm in hellfire peninsula. That gear should have been marginally better than high 50s greens and quest rewards.
---
FOr tHe hORde!! Let's defend our dirt hovels and pig farms from the aLlIaNcE

Neither do I but I understand that world is full on idiots
---
I hope he does, personally.
---
Truly sorry that all of the petitions and requests have been for a vanilla classic server, maybe you could join forces with other TBC fans and begin a movement and a petition for TBC?
---
Ultimately I think classic is better than nothing, its a great place to start and if Classic can do something a bit different and not simply follow the path set by expansions, then we could all benefit.
---
Oh and I never played classic, I started back end of vanilla and into wotlk, so it is not as if I am selfishly asking for a version I played.
---

Oh, sure. My little rant about politics was regarding the modern state of affairs in our country/the world. I think our founding fathers would cry if they saw what our government has become. The government was never intended to poke it's nose into our individual lives this deeply!

Before we get slapped by one of the mods we'll end this convo here. Ha!

I use 1-6, q, e, r(autorun), t, f, g and ~.

Shift+control+Mb1, 2, 3.

This setup takes care of my main and bottom left action bars. All others I just mouse click.
---
r5 intellect is 1510 mana. my warlord mage can cast AI 3-4 times and im oom.
---
unending breath only has 1 rank.. 50 mana.. not really on the same level.
---
but then f1 f2 etc keys are too far.
---
Agreed and as dumb as it sounds the loot isn't really a big deal at all, they running through the bosses at current tier difficulty will be enough :)
---
I'd rather just play through the world. I don't care about going fast or efficiently, I want to have fun and explore. I've leveled a bunch on old vanilla and now on private servers and every time I take my time and enjoy it.
---
Also, this whole "not enough quests" thing is thrown around a lot but not accurate at all. I never had an empty quest log or quests I couldn't do; we're in 1.12 not 1.0. Granted at some levels you have orange/green quests that aren't totally optimal, but to say there aren't enough quests to level to 60 is not true.
---
What's is going on? He said he this? No way 
---
Still better then a hot pocket..
---
Debatable. I dont think there is anything cool about naming your character after a real life person or an already existing fictional character but that might be just me.
---
I laughed at the charname "tuinhekje"
---
as long as i'm not on asmon's server i'lll be happy lol
---
It's not the memes themselves, it's the culture behind said memes...
---
Looks like my cat while he poops.
---
Yes, Undercity sucks.
---
Okay. I wanted to play melee dps but warriors are a dime a dozen and same for rogues. Not sure what to choose.
---
Pro advertising.
---
This is scary looking
---
swifty is very bad at the game, he doesnt play like he used to at the start. Like, he keeps trying to spec prot for pvp in classic when it doesn't do anything when you're wearing leather/mail at 30
---
So basically we’d be slowly transitioning to current WoW again. Dying gear, transmogging gear, achievements, new mounts, mount tab, etc. It’s a slippery slope.
---
Farming Mid-40's Dungeons is a lucrative option for gold if your Full prot, and if you are invested in that as your primary income source there are some initially expensive items you can purchase off the AH that with a little time easily make up their initial high cost.  
---
Skullflame Shield is the best example of one of those farming items, have a dozen of so mobs attacking you at once in those mid tier dungeons and [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=1168/skullflame-shield](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=1168/skullflame-shield) will keep you alive and kill everything for you at the same time.
---
A few friends who might not all be available at the same times or might not want to run certain dungeons.
---
Man - so nice
---
Yup thx
---
The thing to keep in mind about classic is all specs get all abilities for that class (minus talent abilities). So you don't have to be a certain spec to tank. The talents just shape what youll be a bit better as, but you don't NEED to be Prot.
---
Isnt hold, its stuck

To that note, I tuned into Cdew playing Shaman in WSG and he was mis-timing so many abilities.  Watched someone else pushing towards level 20 in 10 hours with a gnome warlock (name Monka or something like that), dude was fighting mobs 3-4 levels higher than himself in Redridge with his fucking IMP and barely surviving.  
---
How do these fools have enough subscribers to make a living off this?  I swear, it got me thinking about just ponying up the $$ for the streamer equipment, practice some fake charisma, and rolling the dice that the views and money will come.
---
oh i dunno, maybe because they are doing a stress test of the servers and while monitoring them they noticed that a whole fuckload of nonsense was going on in a tiny area and that was worth paying attention to?
---
You poor Horde mongrels can't even appreciate actual architecture!
---
Always greener on the otherside or something like that I guess :')
---
Their skill set allows them to farm and pull multiple mobs at once much easier than other classes. Mages have portals so early on you can make a decent amount just spamming in the cities chats for portals to other cities for people. Other than that they aren’t much more efficient than other classes for gold farming. Your gold farming will depend more on what activities you are doing to farm it.
---
Why only alliance?
---
^ same, I hate women who treat sex as a prize for something
---
Like "honey you have to earn it" screw that bitch, youre enjoying it 2

60% of the population is Horde, the other 40% is dead.

&gt; Warriors need a crap ton of arcanite bars. 
---
can you fill me in here?
---
There is a DND show I watch that takes place during classic wow. One of the early arcs the party goes to lakeshire and they spend a few weeks there. They did a good job of bringing that city to life for all its glory. Lakeshire is dope
---
Tried to mix the ugly ass old cat form ( I like it better tho ) with some fluff.

I guess i failed at both.

Heroic Classes or get the fuck out.
---
They don’t want people to make games that break the immersion. Such as MrT. Lol.
---
ha
---
Uh, that’s because BIS depends on your attack level? And some weapons can only use certsin attacks? Dumbfuck.
---
It’s like saying that we should add BiS lvl 39 twink pvp gear for people to farm because it’s not the same as lvl 60 bis gear.
---
Jesus, can a person be more stupid?
---
TBC with vanilla cores BUT with arena would be great. No flying mounts would already solve many of the problems wow started to face since tbc. Ground mounts made the world feel alive. Someone phasing in and out while flying at 300% speed doesnt feel the same.
---
Yes, dont listen to the other reply
---
Shamans are only on horde in vanilla, and paladins only alliance.
---
Hunters are the only mail wearers on ally :)
---
naw
---
Yeah , if that's what you want to play though don't like other people affect your decision.
---
 You'll likely just be wishing you played what you really wanted to, pretty much I'd just play what your heart truly desires . Example: you might not make the best min-maxing guild on your server's raids as a ret pala , but at least you'll be enjoying what you play and it's not like no group would take a ret, it's just more rare. Most classes and specs can be played in vanilla if you have a group that's willing to compromise with you so you can enjoy the raid and it's not just "clear as fast as possible"
---
If you eat Lightning Glands, won't you ... crap lightning glands?
---
Thats just not true that the only thing TBC did better was raids. Class balance and design was 100% improved on and gave a meaningful role for each class/spec to fill in pve or pvp, which you can not say about Vanilla. Also PvP certainly improved in a lot of peoples opinions. 
---
Sure there is a lot of subjectivity but its pretty dumb to say "The only thing tbc did better was raids"
---
Wow I like this set-up a lot, JW is MB1 the same as left click? Or are you referring to other mouse buttons?
---
Yeah, sure. Just that you can't really *manipulate* capitalism. Sure it's bad that there is corporate greed. Just sounds like you're making an ideological comment against capitalism. 
---
Sounds weird to make this all about capitalism since you can't really say it's at fault. Just a company, or a collection of individuals in charge, acting with greed (or the game industry as a whole being shitty/toxic).
---
But you're looking to be a feral/PvP druid.
---
Furor is mandatory. It's pretty much mandatory for all builds except PvE resto.
---
You underestimate my level of trash, dear boy.
---
Mages can farm Dire Maul from 52+ later when it releases, they can also farm the turtles in Maraudon when they complete the scepter quest.I know you mentioned DM won't be out untill later, but I wanted to mention this farm spot as something to consider for the mages here when it releases.
---
This isn’t the case. I have a character that blizzard renamed “DONOTRESTORE” and while it does get trimmed down in length to “DONOTRESTO” it is displayed in all caps in game.
---
You should play a paladin if you are even considering it a little bit. I played a ret paladin through vanilla and tbc. They are incredibly fun to play and level. I focused on pvp and did really well. I was in the minority of players. People will be crappy about you being a non optimal spec but that is no reason to not play what is fun or what you want. You will probably be able to find a guild that will get through mc and possibly some bwl with off specs in the raid. We know more now than we ever did in vanillia and honestly we dont need 40 min/maxed rogues, mages, warriors, and priests to clear the first two raids. There will be room for some boomkins and stuff. If you dont mind floating around the bottom of the dps charts with the moonkins, feral druids, and shadow priests then play a ret paladin and have fun.
---
And if you are ever feeling frustrated about your dps just challenge your guilds top mage and rogue to a duel and crush them a couple times and you should feel a lot better lol
---
On the horde side, hunters compete with many shaman builds that wear mail. Paladins wear plate.
---
Layering is still better than the alternative, though.
---
Pretty much this. Lower level stuff is going to be insanely plentiful. I'll be funneling anything that could possibly sell well to a bank alt, but I expect to vendor most common items on him as it won't be worth the cut and time to post them.
---
Also, I was trying to keep my response as simple and noob friendly as possible. As a totally new player, you can easily afford your 40 mount without going to the AH as long as you vendor everything, grind at points, and only buy necessary stuff.
---
You might be on to something. Imagine every US state had a different language and would only be loosely connected with a second language. There would hardly be any big streamers. And it seems like big streamers pull in more and get the whole thing started for others too. Also EU has different privacy laws that restrict IRL streaming.
---
Kevin Jordan?  Not sure if he’s doing classic right now though.
---
Tis true, alliance will be #1
---
Lol think I only ever ran this dungeon once or twice with PUGs and this is so accurate i smiled in public when I saw it.
---
I did 28k
---
Yeah gsync is some of the most hokus hokus shit you never know if it's working lol
---
I would love it if the player base could be kept together. Instead of expansions what if new content was released within classic that took inspiration from TBC or WOTLK etc, where maybe the classes eventually get tweaked to incorporate some of the flavour that the later expanisons introduced.
---
Would that not be worth keeping the player base together?
---
Most likely practice for some and others binding them to their mouse
---
That is true. I was just saying that most of the *bosses* don't have a "know what to do *here* or cause wipe" mechanic.
---
Ok so it could have easily been too powerful so they decided to just put it in as a flavor thing, kinda sad because honestly I don't find any of the troll racial abilities useful at all.
---
yeah FUCK that kid!!
---
Got you, part of the fun for me is being competitive in dps and I feel like the playstyle of a paladin is mostly autoattacks which i dont find too engaging. Probably gonna go rogue.
---
Yeah that seems to be the tacit plan! the communities are a pain, so it's better to wait it out. I'm glad I can just enjoy launch without that kind of thing in mind
---
IlIlIl
---
Which one is I and which is L??
---
All classes operate on the same stats you can get, with the exception of Druids getting +FAP on certain items. That gives away itemization isn't the issue. Druids, Ret paladins and some of the other terrible specs/classes in PvE, usually gets just as much out of STR/AGI/Whatever as the other classes being the best DPS, in terms of raw power, it's that their abilities scale poorly with that raw power. 
---
It's a dead giveaway it's the spell/ability coefficients being low, the mechanics of certain abilities/spells and the lack of certain abilities which make other abilities worthwhile.
---
A retribution paladin does get a lot out of +crit, +hit, str/agi and whatever else is on the BiS gear, it's just that these stats on a Warrior means a lot more, because their abilities scale better with it, because of having a better/more viable design. I think that's a clear showcase of itemization not being the problem.
---
Ret Paladins and Warriors share somewhat the same items for DPS, Literally no stats which is good on DPS Warriors is going to be bad on a Ret paladin, another example of itemization being fine.
---
How do you purpose you change itemization for the bad specs, without fucking over existing specs or making them even better? They all share gear with each other. Are you going to come up with something like +FAP for other specs/classes as well? Doesn't that seem to cause more confusion and seem like a band aid solution, instead of just make them scale better off the stats we already know?
---
Not including left and right click. My mouse has the middle mousebutton and two left side buttons. I think they are designated as 3 4 and 5. Cant recall.
---
&gt;He was never good
---
That's pretty unfair.
---
He was definitely good for the time. You don't just lead a guild, main tank and develop strats for new content and then get consistant world firsts by being bad at the game. Many people had a shit load of free time then who could not achieve that.
---
Also backpedalling wasn't really a big deal back then. It was actually sort of necessary when tanking as you need to be always facing the boss, and backwards strafing made controlling adds and boss position difficult. 
---
I know people scream about how terrible it is nowadays because it's what they always heard others say on forums etc, but that has mostly come from a PVP or DPS/Healer perspective where it is obviously always a bad idea. 
---
Kungen has a bad reputation today because when he came back to the game in the later years, he was lazy and just didn't want to catch up with how people play the game now. His clicking and backpedalling won't really matter so much in classic, because the encounters are a lot slower paced and don't require lightning reactions and high mobility like they do today.
---
The word mandatory depends entirely on you and the other players you intend on surrounding yourself with.
---
Are you the type of player who has to be in a top guild? If so, it's probably mandatory for you.
---
Just don't be that obnoxious guy in the casual guild that raids MC 1-2 nights a week and sometimes kills most of the bosses bitching about "RAID DPS IS TOO LOW BECAUSE ALL OF OUR MELEE DIDN'T LEVEL ENG"
---
Hey man, I get it. You would rather noobs clutter up some other sub with their questions. 
---
I’m just wondering where this tight nit helpful social community that everyone harps about comes in.
---
Ah, thanks!
---
yes
---
Now do Sunken Temple full clear map.
---
I'm the same way, I can't stand not doing well.  Rogue is always solid and fun in wpvp . Good luck with your choice! Lots of time though lol
---
Nice Map of the Sunken Temple.
---
Yes and no, I'm guessing some of them being friends will choose the same, but that still means that one of them will get it, guaranteed, like I wouldn't see someone other than Asmon getting the mount... He'll just have everyone under his thumb
---
I always wondered why not have orges.  At the end of WC3 Rexxar was leader of the Stonemaul clan.  They had been part of the horde since WC1 even.
---
I put that first edit to promote less hate from people who completely shut it down. Anyone can do anything they want with this data.
---
This game had some amazing starter zones. Dun Morough into Loch Modan is fantastic, going from the snowy hills to that massive lake. Mulgore and Teldrassil are also up there.
---
I see, but part of the fun for me is being competitive in dps so I think I'm going to end up going with rogue. Thanks for the insight though
---
I feel like this hits the wrong points. I dont see why nre content to classic would go down the same path as retail. They made classic knowing it's different. Its unbalanced and broken but that's what people want and that's how they rebuilt it so I really doubt they'll go out of their way to fix it. You'll have your squishy rogues, your subpar hybrids with utility. That's all part of classic design, it's not necessarily good in all ways but if they didnt fix it for release why would they go back to it?
---
I'm pretty sure the intention is for them to want you to play classic for the broken unbalanced but immersive gameplay and play retail for the balanced fun gameplay.  No reason for them to "fix" classic when retail exists.
---
FWIW, we saw that plenty on the stress test.  Reddit is a pretty horrible gauge of a community.  Its very easy to get a vocal minority to influence things by commenting a lot and religiously downvoting the people that disagree with them.  
---
Combine that with the fact that downvotes are anonymous and can be done for any reason...
---
Combine that with the fact that reddit in general is absolutely *famous* for low effort/content/meme posts getting upvoted to the front page (not just this sub, but most).
---
Now take all that and throw it in a blender with people that are simply flat out sick of it and it creates a cesspool of back and forth hatred, bickering, frustration, etc.  
---
I find myself getting pissy sometimes and just go elsewhere.  It especially gets bad when some specific meme comes up (ffs, the stupid 'lololol look at my rig!' stuff), or when some 'big news' happens that people arent happy about or whatever.  
---
Its just a shame.  Theres plenty of good info and discussion to go around, but sifting through all the shit can be very difficult.
---
40-man raid. Do it as the next step of progression from Naxx. Tier-4 loot. Same philosophy in terms of difficultly from the rest of the Classic experience.
---
Yup definitely true! Also, character creation opens the 13th of august, so there's time to find them
---
None of the German Guys or anyone outside of the US is big enough to have an impact on our EU Servers.  
---
Im once happy to miss out on the "fun" because what you can see with Asmon and so on is completely annoying.
---
He will have constantly 300 people following him gifting him everything and especially on a PvP Server this is death to anyone who doesn't see this moron as their god.  
---
Wouldn't mind playing with someone like Soda or whoever but their following is ruining everything for those that don't want to join their cult.
---
You probably won't even notice guys like Barlow or others on the EU Realms which is good.
---
They have their guilds and stuff for their fans but they don't impact anyone who doesn't give a shit about them.
---
If you're a software engineer I'm sure I don't need to tell you that some things will log A LOT of things in a "rough time period". And sometimes, logs are circular so the issue someone mentions has been purged from the logs a long time ago. That's why you want them to actually capture logs from when the described event had taken place so that there's a chance to troubleshoot it. 
---
But yeah, since you're a software engineer at a major bank I'm saying things you already know. I also don't need to tell you how little things the WoW client actually logs that are relevant to the gameplay, since 99% of everything that occurs is server side in an MMORPG.
---
economic bullshit due to population, pvp imbalance, constant raiding, lots of POSSIBLE problems
---
I feel one of my obligations as a priest is to buff passing players and with stam buff. Usually get other buffs in return. Gotta love the classic community.
---
My bindings are pretty good I think. I’ve messed with them over the years to my liking. It looks like:
---
1-5: Main spells that I have to cast often
---
F1-F5: Often AoE and damage cool downs
---
Ctrl 1-5: Defensives
---
Mouse 3-5: Other abilities that I use often
---
Ctrl + Mouse 3-5: Trinkets or stuff like that
---
Shift + Mouse 3-5: Mounts, underwater breathing, water walking, things like that.
---
Damn, was that in vanilla too? Maybe I'm just an idiot.
---
Right, that makes sense. Seems like the Classic camera movements still work.
---
I much rather play on NA than play on EU with Russian spergs
---
Oh I agree it's gameplay but I was more of considering Blizzard's "definition" of automation.
---
Quest helpers do impact gameplay but they don't automatically push any button instead of you or accept/complete quests, in that sense they're not automation and that's why I don't believe Blizzard will oppose them in Classic.
---
No this ain't BFA rogues can't restealth every 2 sec or if they do they don't move around at mount speeds 
---
If he vanishes you can literally walk away
---
If he blinds you he is getting a restealth no matter what 
---
But if you survive all that he can't do shit anymore so frost shock to avoid melee range for gouges and kidneys and kite
---
Substitute "keep track of" with "reach" in my comment, then. Everything else applies to both. 
---
Getting +8 dexterity is *really* easy IRL. Just a few weeks of yoga or reaching for modifiers is all it takes.
---
Then she would just be doing it twice
---
Never played on one. In anyone's past experience, was PVP just as prevalent in the open world as it is on traditional PVP servers? And did people actually RP? Would be an interesting thing to see!
---
It's weird how 3-4 soda fans have commented and every one has said there must be something wrong with me for not liking him. Fanboy all you want, makes him seem even worse
---
And they are both Magic so in pvp they can get purged/dispelled instead of something useful :)
---
I mean, still not a hugely useful pair of buffs, but hey free buffs are free buffs!
---
Funny thing is he pledged 300$ to that specific game to now hate the game, and to get hated by that specific community as well
---
I still play with a few of the same people from back then. But there are countless more I've lost touch with and miss. I keep checking vanilla friends and various discords to see if any of them pop up. No luck so far.
---
Vanilla has a clearly best thing in at least most of the important categories. That is not good.
---
* Best faction: Alliance (100% for sure)
---
* Best race: Human (I believe this one could be argued)
---
* Best class: Warrior (100% for sure)
---
* Best profession: Engineering (100% for sure)
---
Well for stress test this is exactly what they want to happen. They are also experimenting with layering and stuff to be prepared for launch 
---
We are just a number and data for them to test in their newly designed servers.
---
I report bugs, or at least what I think r bugs. I think alot of people do cuz you just hope that they notice u SENPAI and inv u to beta.
---
I will always stand behind my dude Sequisha. So entertaining and very knowledgeable. He keeps his chat under control and that's what I appreciates about him.
---
Pervert.
---
On a fresh server, I usually take skinning and herb to start. I have certain check points for herbalism skill but skinning is so easy to stay on top of. Just vendor all the skins for extra cash. 
---
At level 36 I drop skinning and pick up alchemy and then power level it with all my herbs I’ve been gathering to make nature resist potions. This allows me to solo the cyclonian at this level and get the whirlwind axe without help (which, if you’re leveling hard - there won’t be much help) 
---
I then usually stick with alchemy for the rest of the game. Once I get a good gig going with that I may drop herbalism for engineering.
---
They could probably charge for each old xpac and still make new ones. They wouldn’t have to do much with the old xpacs except make sure they don’t break or bug, and have a relatively small team for each one for that. They could still make a ton of money
---
The problem isnt the gear though, at some point it will be very very hard to find 40 people to do the content with (except maybe incentives to high levels to carry, which also sucks). 5 is even hard if the server cap is low.  Agree that there is a middle ground though.
---
My apologise, I miss-read the post.
---
Been a while since I did any research (15 years or so lol) so take with a grain of salt but,
---
1 point of int is about 0.1% increase chance of skill gain. As the gain itself is variable depending on current skill to cap ratio, it's not overly noticable but it's a bonus.
---
So 100int would increase the final point gain by about 10% per strike.
---
However I do not recall if its additive or multiplictive 
---
Hmm... guess it wasnt much help actually lol sorry
---
Dude after watching Asmongold for 20 minutes it's insanely clear how bad of a person irl he is. He's loud, authoritative, fussy, and pretentious. After begging 60g from his followers for a necklace he went on a rant about how smart and good of a salesman he is because he whispered the guy "61g now," thereby providing "immediacy" and that's what GOOD salesmen do lmaooo He's a tool
---
No they are thicc and juicy
---
$
---
You can disagree with me but agility gives dps, armor and dodge.
---
Prioritizing agility over stam is by far the most efficient way to level. In pvp it is an entirely different story but he asked specifically about leveling.
---
Don't forget buffs. Wisdom for the lock, might for the void?
---
Sounds like smooth leveling to me
---
Best Wishes to you on finding them. With the help of Discord and other Tech these days they will pop up.
---
Are factions unbalanced that much?
---
First, take pride in this effort. You went to great lengths, you took an inordinate amount of time, and you put serious thought and effort into doing something that you had set your mind to. This is something to be very proud of, and that is a pretty cool pet.
---
Secondly, I will piggyback what others have said and that you should report this as a bug.  Hunter's cannot tame pets that are higher level than them.  We all need to do our part to report bugs we find- even if it is just a small one and it's kind of helpful to the player. everyone wants a good class experience, and this means doing our part as beta players.
---
I hope they let you keep the pet. Anyone who knows the pet database will be able to tell right away how much effort you put into this.
---
Demo shout spam should still work.
---
I could test the battle shout threat later.  It's used to pull heal aggro back to the warrior on mobs outside of demo shout range right?
---
where?
---
I don’t mean to be a Debbie downer but I think it’s too soon to say.  People get excited over betas and when you allow people into the game for limited time windows you obviously get higher concentrations.
---
I think we need to wait for 6 or so months after launch to know if the statement didn’t age well.  The whole point was the rose tinted glasses that would wear off when you really started playing.
---
I do still think he was wrong but I also think to prove that we need to wait until the playerbase at large has time to possibly burn out.
---
To each their own
---
Most of what you said is true but it doesn't mean that different itemization wouldn't have a big effect. For example, it's recently been shown that ret paladins focusing on spell damage rather than trying to wear warrior gear works better, they could introduce new spell damage plate that takes it a step further. They could introduce relics that have effects like "Your abilities benefit an extra 30% from your spell damage" or "You gain 50% of your strength as spell damage". There's plenty of room for gear like that to improve the low performance specs.
---
1. arena
---
2. No layering, dynamic spawning instead
---
3. high population servers.
---
Because expansions move away from classic, they fracture the playerbase and ultimately you cant give everyone what they want, there has to be some middle ground and my thought process is this:
---
Start with classic, then in a similar vein to OSRS, introduce content which increases classics life span, take advantage of the huge world azeroth provides and in doing so take inspiration from TBC or WOTLK etc, but aim to keep the player base together rather then splitting them with increased level caps.
---
My fave expansion was WOTLK, I never played vanilla but do you know what excites me about vanilla?? Bringing everyone back to one expansion and I think there is great potential in serving everyone within it.
---
So no I wont shut the fuck up, I will continue to to make suggestions and I hope you do the same. Thanks.
---
It’s a sweeping generalization to be sure. I’ve always played alliance and met some horrendous players and some amazing ones. And same is true on horde side.
---
I pretty much only did Warrior PvP in Vanilla and I would say I was pretty competent. It seems kind of shitty to just brush off any theorycrafting by appealing to the authority of guides and unnamed competent PvPers.
---
The differences we are discussing are pretty minor overall. So I'm just going to do the same thing I did in Vanilla, make my own decisions and do tons of PvP to test them out. I may eventually decide Anger Management is indispensable or that I should be 3/3 Imp Hamstring, but I will do so from experience instead of just believing somewhat condescending people on the internet.
---
I first started playing in tbc and into wotlk and I was a complete fucking noob, mostly because I was 8-11 years old. I do feel like there are tons of people out there that have the edge over me right now because theyve been grinding out this shit for years on pservers or were at least clearing tough raids back when I was fucking around at max lvl when I was a youngin. But I've since competed high level in a multitude of games so I figured if I put in the work and do the research I'll be a weapon
---
&gt;[Hordes way to summon Omar](https://imgur.com/a/SJbgWPw)
---
I think a lot of it was also how it made just about all of the "meme" spec's viable for end-game in some fashion but still had their individual qualities that made them unique.
---
I mean, give druids a few more cat form abilities; not to be on par with rogues but atleast good enough to do decent dps without having to farm gnomergan.
---
Give shadowpriests, balance druids, and ele shamans the ability to last a raid boss without OOM after 1-2 min.
---
Atleast, things like that are what i would enjoy about TBC. How it invalidated just about all of the old world sucked tho. 
---
But again, that's just me.
---
How do you RP pvp?
---
Protip, Play on a PVE server. Any streamer who wants to be successful; will defiantly be on a PVP server.
---
Ends up on a server with Method instead.
---
How can you tame higher level beast, should be a bug.
---
People needing to beg to be invited to the pentagram layer is still a massive issue imo.
---
what are you talking about PEPEGAPEPEHANDSOMEGALLULW. I feel so bad for people that communicate in twitch emotes
---
Okay, I set myself up for that one. Here’s an upvote.
---
To spam? No. You don't spam it.
---
I believe the taunt works in the same batch as the freezing trap, so you have a split second as you are charging to get the taunt off.
---
Good hunter isn't going to have pet next to them if they are doing this.
---
There won’t be. They already said it.
---
Don't forget to visit l'Abbaye de Citeaux for the cheese cellars.
---
Anyone who fell off the top and into the slime pool found the cockroach vendor. 
---
Which was 99% of players
---
Numbers on warriors are funny. 
---
First you have a skewed result as most bank alts are warriors so you already have an inflated population. Also a massive portion of the population that rolls or creates a warrior does not make it 60 thus also giving inflated numbers compared to what’s really out there. 
---
On top of all of that - another portion of warriors that do hit 60 realize how much more time and gold will have to go into the character before they start to reap the reward. A lot of people seem to have this idea that making it to 60 is the only hard part. It’s not. That’s just one part of the hill. You still need to gear up to become anything more than a meat shield. 
---
But let me tell you man - don’t let population size deter you. Private servers have shown that even with a massive population on the class - knowing what you’re doing and being flexible will always open a spot for you.
---
Honestly, wailing caverns was way worse since it was at the beginning of the game, by level 48 or so you at least got somewhat used to the game so you weren't running around in circles.
---
I dont get how people can look at the dps charts and be okay with warr/rogue doing nearly double the other specs dps. Straight up delusional people here
---
Except you max out weapon skill pretty early into a new level
---
Yeah I never said it was useless , I just said I think Stam is better. The armor and Dodge from agility is not much of a factor imo while leveling , as youd be lucky to get +5 agi as a warrior by the time you're lvl 30 .
---
I just think Stam is far more useful, more health means less time drinking and eating which means more uptime questing and killing mobs. 
---
Beautiful thing is we can disagree, but I guess the downvotes have already come out :(
---
Clip?
---
This mount alone makes me want to play a Human paladin lol.
---
Glad it made you smile! :)
---
It’s common knowledge that hunters farm well, but I made my money as a mage in vanilla being a double gatherer, playing the auction house, and selling portals/food/water in cities for tips.
---
I had my heart set on paladin since that is what I main mostly ever since i really started playing in TBC. in Wotlk i started tanking and fell in love with it, more specifically main tank. I was main tank for all my guilds for every expac. And i even lead a few guilds myself.
---
Going into classic i knew paladins cant tank raids, but i still figured id do it and go holy, figuring that fulfilling class fantasy would keep me motivated, then i found that most proper gear for healing is not plate.... also you dont even get the epic charger till phase 2 so im buying a epic mount anyway like everyone else.
---
Id really would rather be maintank and try and be the best on the server, while leading a raiding guild. 
---
the pros of warrior far outweigh the pros of paladin
---
warrior-
---
1. can main tank
---
1. if main tank can get thunderfury (i know its still hard)1. 
---
1. can easily find groups 
---
1. usually high priority for gear (if main tank)
---
paladin
---
1. can fill any role well in 5 mans
---
1. free mount at 40
---
1. basically gets all int plate and shields
---
1. 4-5 needed per raid
---
The con of wariror is ive never played on and would be at a disavantage in pvp for a while. 
---
I was also excited to go engineer as paladin, warriors i dont think can do a money sink prof like engineering especially as main tank.
---
Looks like im going warrior?
---
Plenty of warriors will try to grab good dps mail and leather gear early on, just keep that in mind
---
This is good though, let them all play on one server together and don't allow cross server b.s. That way they do their thing on one server while everyone else has fair play/balance across other servers. If all of them play together it's just going to be stupid to even try and fight them since they'll have a massive following of players with them and all the time in the world to get better gear than you.
---
Yes it works and usually if you charge into them while they are already on the trap you’re screwed. 
---
Taunting the pet is usually a pre-emptive thing.
---
What is retail's average active concurrent player count? No one know, but I'd be willing to bet it is shockingly low.
---
I look to OSRS's current out-performance of its modern version as a basis of comparison. I've been doing it for years and I know that I can predict some of WoWs trends based on Runescape.
---
People just need to believe that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Retail WoW is a victim of this phenomenon and Classic WoW has a good chance of succeeding Retail.
---
Dips on posting this tomorrow!
---
ahh yes, for some reason i wasnt thinking about crafted items...
---
In vanilla I decided to go for a rare bat from tirisfal. As a nelf it felt awesome when I was able to hearthstone back after catching it. Stuff like this is what gets me hyped for the game.
---
In a lot of ways it is
---
Player from defias brotherhood eu - guilds used to organize alliance vs horde stuff.
---
That doesn't impact my point that bfa falls in that category and vanilla/classic does not. A huge 'juicy' part of classic is the leveling itself. Because it is fundamentally different from 'modern' (/cashgrab) games.
---
Haven’t played that much on retail (~half a year in 2012-13), but I loved Defias Brotherhood. Multiple dedicated WPvP guilds, and tons of drama on the forums. Afaik a few years later all the server drama went to a next level, with twitter pages being dedicated to shittalk and doxx the biggest drama queens.
---
Same boat... stopped playing shortly after Wrath dropped, so this is a long time coming for me. 
---
I definitely won’t have as much time to play as I did in the past since I have a family and career now but I’m certainly excited for the nostalgia and do my best to grind this out. 
---
I’ve attempted to play a few different times since then, when  Mists came out and then again in Cataclysm but had very little interest putting more than a few hours into those expansions- it just didn’t feel like the WoW I came to love. Since my departure there haven’t been any RPGs that was able to hold my attention of my adhd mind like Classic and TBC did.
---
tltr: just like op, I’m super excited and really can’t fucking wait for Classic to drop!
---
why do you guys like being on high horses so much? it’s a fucking video game. relax
---
You miss the entire point of OP's reduction.
---
Do you even understand how a reductive description works? OP is right - SB spam is the base, yes. Should we count a dreadsteed as a used ability because you'll eventually use a mount to get to the instance? Using a pot? Healthstone? No. The reduction of the rotation is SB.
---
"DOOM: You shoot things". That's a reduction.
---
The more you know!
---
*rightclick* --&gt; "report"
---
Fuck yeah cause I wanna play Classic to see as few players as possible and have the least amount of interactions with people as possible. That's what I miss about Classic the most, the solitude and lack of social fabric. Heh, fuck streamers those losers.
---
&gt; Spirit is the best stat for leveling on all classes, especially Warrior
---
This is a totally new concept to me. Best I can find (based on private servers) is that it's marginally useful for a warrior, but requires excessive bag space. It seems much simpler to just get some mage food and not worry about multiple sets. Even if you went this armor swapping route, that doesn't make it the "most important stat" it makes it the "most important out of combat set stat."
---
But you opened my eyes that the buff/stat is not useless for a warrior.
---
If you are planning on leveling fast I would suggest forgoing the WWA until at least level 35, the materials required to even get the final stage of the quest chain to fight Cyclonian are dropped from mobs that will be still red to you at 30 and with fluxuate between orange and Yellow even still at 35.
---
If you have a group of 3 people I would say plan your zones out so that around the time you all hit mid thirties you will be heading to arathi highlands anyways and simply do the grinding for your essences at the same time as you do the zone quests.
---
Going hard to get the WW axe at 30 will only put you behind everyone else who skipped it for later and who will have an easier time than you did and very likely remain well ahead of you in EXP going forward.
---
Warlocks "use" their pets way more, hunters heal theirs.
---
Been talking about this since classic wow was announced, I even had the exact conversation yesterday with a coworker. I would actually cry if we got this.
---
The flight master/mailbox thing in UC is like a USB key. You try it once, it doesn't work. So you switch it (run to the other side). It doesn't work either (still the mail box). So then you wonder how dumb you are, switch side again shamefully and it works (you finally find the flight master)
---
Okay. As of now I've been watching tons of vids trying to catch up because back when i played wow I was 8-11 years old in tbc and into wotlk so I had absolutely no clue what I was doing. Over the years I've played a bunch of games at a high level so I'm confident if I put in the work I can become potent in whichever role I choose.
---
I really dont want Classic to progress out of classic. TBC gave us flying mounts and 25 man raids. they were already slipping down the easy slope. If it's popular enough, couldnt new vanilla zones been even better than TBC?
---
Didn't seem like a bug. I just assumed it was another thing private servers got wrong. It did tell me that the 13 was too high. I'll report it next stress test just to be sure they look the situation over.
---
If the actual weapon damage range is higher on average, it's gonna hit harder regardless of speed, since they normalized weapon speeds sometime around patch 1.6. That being said, dps still does matter.
---
I 2nd this. There's plenty of items that sell oddly on the AH. Shadowgems for example get posted on AH often below vendor price because....idk why lol (people are stupid sometimes), but you can buy it for 2 silver and vendor for 2.5silver. Its a small profit but if theres 20 gems up below vendor price its free money
---
For pet management hunter does it a lot in raids, not that much in pvp. In pvp good warlocks can be spotted by their use of felhunter, but they don't even use pets in raids.
---
And you had the audacity to not give the poor bastard a name. Fuck you man. You're worse than Jon Snow.
---
It’s because they are 11 years old and twitch is their life. Seeing themselves on screen is the highlight of their lives unfortunately for them.
---
I see what you're saying. I think my biggest issue is just having a hard reset on the game. I think theres a better way to do things moving forward from vanilla. 
---
Again, ZG is a great example of catchup. It doesnt need to be done with 20man raids either. There could be 5mans that are challenging enough to require some progression to get to, while still offering something to players that have already progressed. 
---
One thing I dont like about how it's handled in BFA for example, is tou hit a certain point in the progression where your power level just spikes. You don't feel like you have earned anything.
---
\- flying mounts
---
\- smaller raids
---
\- daily quests
---
\- hitting 61 instantly makes 70% of the game obsolete
---
TBC far from perfect
---
&gt;Warlocks spam shadowbolts, that's it.
---
"THATS IT."
---
Sorry I don't do backflips to change the meaning of something to support my argument...
---
Pretty much.
---
Once a server reaches Naxxramas it tends to die out.
---
I fully expect to have staggered releases on realms, so I can see new servers going online once Naxxramas is out for a year for a new progression cycle and latecomers who want to know what all that classic is about. Now the old servers die out and you either have new content or you start on a newly released server.
---
New content on an old server is fully open to new consideration like OSRS does it. Horizontal itemisation, challenge runs, Kharazan. Anything goes really. Atleast this could be one way it could work.
---
I'm not saying it will, but it's a possibility to keep the game going.
---
Question about how thorns affects threat. Does the dmg/threat that thorns produces count as dmg/thrrat from the druid or the person with the buff?
---
That's amazing! World PVP raid on factions would be so fun with a RP edge to it. Love that.
---
Toxic retard.
---
The funny thing is, I never played classic. I started late TBC and the game took off for me in WOTLK. Yet do you know why I want a classic server more than WOTLK?
---
Because it brings everyone together, under one game and instead of then splitting that into different expansions I think there is great potential to do something different, in spirit of classic and maybe take some inspiration from TBC and WOTLK. I don't want to deprive anyone, I want classic to work for as many people as possible.
---
That's far from the only downside prot paladins have, lmao.
---
Lol I've been upvoting suggestions and checking them out, and downvoting dumb shit posts like yours. I guess a person does think themselves superior to entertainment they don't think is worth their time, but really I'm judging these people as people and as products. They are both at once. You can stretch my words and use them against me all you want but it's obvious you're fanboying for one of the idiots in my OP.
---
Honestly, I wanted to save naming him for when Classic launches. I didnt want to get too attached to my beta-bear. Lol. Also as you can see from chat the beta was almost over. I tamed him with like 5 minutes to spare
---
If they ever revisit Outland, I'd love to see them redo the dungeons with a classic approach. I'm pretty sure some like Auchindoun were supposed to be giant mazes like Sunken Temple and Dire Maul, I'd really like to see that in practice.
---
How is that better than the mage food?
---
Why do people watch complilation videos of people yelling at the microphone. This is retarded. Am I too old or what
---
Hi, /u/Dramatized, your post has been removed as it is seems to be talking about the current stress test. Please use the current [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bui555/stress_test_2_the_megathread_of_omg_why_can_i_not/) instead.
---
Sure, feel free to do it.
---
From my experience its actually a great middle ground **as long as we get together and make a channel for that**.
---
I know some people (not me) would rather not have thousands of people on the same few koordinates and rather get on with their gaming, which is fine. The rest of us can amass att the same place all we want and delibirately choose the lag.
---
I was in the stress test yesterday and was pretty lucky with my layers and would invite a bunch of people. At the same time whenever i got kicked from the fun layers i'd get instantly invited back even though the chat was a sea of "inv" spam
---
My generation did the whole 1337 speak nonsense, so I understand that portion.  Yes, it is stupid, so was 1337 speak, so has been every youthful piece of infantile humor.  
---
With streamers it's the virtual panhandling of a mediocre personality playing a game often poorly that boggles my mind.  I understand the feeling of tribalism.  I just can't accept that people have such low standards.  
---
I watched X because they made me better at PvP.  Understandable
---
I watched Y because they are Y.  Nonsense.
---
I loved going to the BG entrance to queue, it made those zones feel more alive.
---
Thanks dude
---
I dunno ZG was really fun and had such amazing drops.
---
I jumped into Retail the other day. First time in years.
---
Went into trade chat and said "Classic, HYPE!"
---
...and got a dozen response variants of "Praise Omar!" "Thank you, Omar!" "Lok'Tar Omar!"
---
It was glorious.
---
Because this isn’t Xbox live.
---
You have to level all the way through TBC to get flying, except for Druid if I recall
---
Did you read the post???
---
&gt; Warlocks spam shadowbolts, that's it.   
---
&gt;that's it.   
---
&gt;that's it.
---
Or did that fly past you
---
&gt; Life Tap isnt a spell locks use on rotation?   
---
&gt; To spam? No. You don't spam it. 
---
on rotation =/=  spam it.
---
That is a legitimate reason. No kidding, it seems like 3/4 of the people I talk to are only interested in being able to gank in STV as their sole motivation for missing classic,
---
The dungeon wasn't meant for you...
---
My face knowing damn well no streamers are gonna touch RPPVP servers
---
🙃 My face when I remember there won't be an RPPVP server in classic for some reason
---
I bind 1-5 like usual but my other binds are just the letter keys around WASD, such Q, E, R, F plus 4 mouse buttons. Sometimes I don't feel like it's enough but I'm not about to shift bind anything, it doesn't feel right to me.
---
Let me settle this double key binding thing. It can be done very easily with a razr naga. You can bind shift + 1-5 with a key on your razr naga mouse. 
---
Or just buy a razr naga and bind 1-12 and shift 1-12 . I will be rolling a druid which has a lot of spells and plan on binding 1-12, (first 6 being key spells) shift 1-6, r,f,c,x,z,\` and tab for switching ofc.
---
So you are totally safe if you’re up there?
---
People are overestimating how much this will matter. There will be one server with the main group of streamers, asmon and esfand , and then maybe 10 other servers with high streamer population .
---
It really won't be an issue unless you get unlucky and accidentally pick asmons server on release
---
I follow a lot of pserver folks who aren't in the beta yet. When the game launches they'll be the main people I'm interested in watching. Their knowledge and skill in the game is pretty nuts, they just don't have the beta yet.
---
A real gym rat...oh this isn't a sports forum talking about veiled racist compliments. Nevermind
---
Only because whatever server he was on would be majority horde due to his presence. By playing on Asmongold's server that balances out due to Asmon playing Alliance.
---
The tilt value of playing opposite Soda on a PvP server is just too strong.
---
Cheap Shot -&gt; Mindless Scream -&gt; Break Microphone -&gt; Never Stream Again -&gt; Twitter Rant is hard to turn down.

Very gooid comnent.

Yeah I feel ya. When I played hunter, I took the utmost pride in my pet names. This was legion so I had one from each class. Named them after the goddesses in legend of zelda.
---
Twitch lol?
---
It popped up in my YouTube feed just thought it was funny how spastic some of these streamers are. Legit screaming over something like what faction another player wants to play.
---
I believe that the fucker aka Sunken Temple actually reshapes every time you walk in there. Never had a run there without someone getting totally lost.
---
[Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]
---
Yes, the windfury totem gives a 9 ish second buff on the weapon. You can switch the totem out untill the buff expires.
---
Crendor
---
I honestly think they should charge if they do what the classic dev had mentioned: use the art, use the assets, but build using strict foundational rules that made vanilla, vanilla. This would demand large philosophical changes to even the first expansion.
---
Engr boosts threat, so ideally you go engr despite the cost.

I would say it's a *good* stat, but other stats are more crucial to, like, kill mobs and not die.
---
Nah you're thinking too much into it.
---
E.G. I keep kidney shot on ALT+4. So when it's time to kidney shot someone I start moving by holding both mouse buttons down and a finger to strafe.
---
So I'm using my right hand to move. Left thumb on alt and if I'm strafing right I have my left index on D and use middle to hit 4. If strafing left I use L ring on A and L index on 4.
---
Sounds complicated, but if you do that at a keyboard you'll see it's pretty simple. I'm in no way twisting my fingers in weird directions.
---
No Imp or anything in Raid? I get turning of aggressive and taunt and all that but figured the buffs would come in handy and the slight increase in dps.
---
&gt; Human for both PvP
---
Why would you ever pick Human if you're min-maxing PvP? Weapon skill is irrelevant in PvP. Humans are objectively the worst PvP race on the Alliance as perception is incredibly easy to avoid as an enemy rogue and require pre-emptive use. (It does stack with a Warlock Felhunter's Paranoia so there's that at least.) 
---
Stoneform is fantastic. Escape Artist is a dream ability for a warrior and Shadowmeld can have some practical use in WPvP for ambushes and safer eating as well. 
---
If you're specifically picking a PvP race for a warrior without concern for visuals, you'll probably get the most mileage out of Gnome.
---
100% subjective. Everyone on this subreddit is going to tell you classic wow is better.
---
Your subscription will include both, however. Try both and find out for yourself :)
---
Agreed that dungeon finder started it's down fall. It split up the community and made it to where no one cared about interacting with each other outside of starting raids.
---
Fuck no. Make it a 10 man pre-naxx. The gear will hardly help those in Naxx (or not at all), but it will help those be content with not being able to do Naxx.
---
Lmao
---
They certainly are. For sure, some of the advantages of the class will be hampered by all the competition.
---
I remember back in vanilla, i went to telsdrasil to capture a owl as a lvl 15 troll hunter. Took me 3 hours. But was satisfied.
---
As a warrior I just /salute
---
Ahh Lakeshire, the graveyard of the Alliance.
---
He's having fun and being asmond. He's sarcastic all the time. He knows he's not a pvp god. It's literally just him having fun. You're all taking the bait.
---
This is wrong. 
---
Agility is usually your highest priority.  You’ll be leveling as fury until 40. A good portion of your talents rely heavily on crit and the synergy is huge there. Additionally - the amount of strength required to shave off an entire attack (such as killing a mob in 8 hits as opposed to 9) is usually very very high and not easily obtainable if you are leveling at any decent rate. However, increasing your crit by even just 1% will drastically decrease the kill time required over a full session. 
---
I argue that until +45 - agility is the most useful stat for warriors followed by stamina. Beta has shown that spirit isn’t quite as big of a deal as it is on private servers since the health regen is already very high compared to pservers. 
---
Agility is just such a significant stat while leveling early on.
---
Not if fresh servers (phase 1) are periodically launched.
---
You sound like a chud too lol how do you guys get that across so quickly?
---
May I join your guild? :P
---
+Chill personalities: Frostadamus
---
Also his yt videos are on par with MadSeasonShow's
---
I guess that depends on what you are looking for, retail has all the quality of life "improvements" and completely new expansion every 2 years, meanwhile classic is a 15 year old game.
---
&gt;Most of what you said is true but it doesn't mean that different itemization wouldn't have a big effect. For example, it's recently been shown that ret paladins focusing on spell damage rather than trying to wear warrior gear works better
---
I think itemization can have a big effect, I won't deny that. I just don't think it's anything but a band aid solution. Because you're now relying on items with unique effects and niche items like spell damage plate to make just one class viable. Instead of just rebalancing the scaling of the abilities so they can continue using the gear which is already in the game and we all know them for wearing.
---
I've seen this spell damage Paladins here and there sometimes, but it's always been shot down. Can you post the source showing spell damage paladins are better?
---
&gt;they  could introduce new spell damage plate that takes it a step further.  They could introduce relics that have effects like "Your abilities  benefit an extra 30% from your spell damage" or "You gain 50% of your  strength as spell damage". There's plenty of room for gear like that to  improve the low performance specs.
---
I get your point, but you're now designing plate spell damage gear specifically for one class, on top of already having class specific tier sets. While a lot of other classes are sharing gear.
---
In regards to better relics, the idea is cool, especially since there's not a lot of relics for any of the classes using them. But you're now designing relics which is build-enabling. That seems like a terrible way of 'fixing' terrible specs. Relying on specific relics.
---
This is why I think class balancing is the best. You ensure you can create gear with already established stats we know, without making specific gear for one class/spec, with the exception of tier sets. And not relying on niche items to make them viable, like the relics. I think items shouldn't fix classes and design issues, classes should be viable by themselves and gear should just make them scale better/more, by focusing on certain stats and such.
---
Like Fury scaling pretty exponentially throughout Vanilla and the first expansions is a healthy way of having gear scale for you. They scale really well with getting hit capped and especially crit is important, since they rely on crits to get Flurry and Rage to do more damage with abilities. You can argue gear is build enabling for them, since in some states of the game, you need to reach a certain threshold for fury to take off, but Fury isn't hot garbage before reaching that stage, and it doesn't rely on some gimmick or niche item, to make it decent, like your idea of relics/spell damage plate gear. It's just more of the stats we already know and have on items.
---
He understands the idiocy of that. You need to understand it's sarcasm. He acts like that to get a rise out of people to get viewers. He's constantly trying to fuck with his chat. He's trying to get people to respond just how you are, because that shit gets views.
---
I was a big fan of this in Vanilla. Animals having different abilities, and excelling at specific portions of the game. Then on top of that, elite mobs providing extra incentive to go find and tame them since they have special abilities.
---
I rolled a Druid on a pserver (only played DPS in retail) and I hit people with MotW and thorns 100% of the time.  I would feel like I dick if I was running by someone and couldn't be bothered to hit a couple buttons.
---
But getting the pet too is pretty thoughtful.
---
Twitch.tv/Shikayami. The only good streamer to watch honestly.
---
Leveling to 40 as fury is a pretty bold assumption for every warrior ... 
---
A LOT of people are going to play arms my man.
---
Also spirit was never mentioned, at least by me. Tbh it seems like you may have replied to the wrong comment because about a third , maybe a half of what you said is irrelevant
---
There's 100% been instances where GMs have found that people have passed the line from "warcraft" to harassment. 
---
With that said, all those instances were well after Vanilla, but I assume they'll use the same TOS from modern WoW anyways.
---
Monitor color settings and output dynamic range settings make a difference, but yeah in a sense your right because it looks different based onwhatever your monitor settings. 
---
But to say it doesnt have an effect on recorded footage doesnt sound right
---
Agility gives Crit Chance. Strength gives flat damage.
---
Which you value depends on your level, how much of each you already have, and your spec. If you're levelling as Arms and taking Deep Wounds and Impale then the value of Agility shoots up. You'll have to use the paperdoll character stats to see differences. If you have a pair of gloves with 5 agi vs a pair with 5 strength, equip both and see how much your crit goes up vs your flat DPS on the stat page. 
---
Ideally you want a nice mix of both.
---
Also, whilst "of the Bear" items and strength/stamina gear is certainly the most common stat on mail/plate for Warriors, you get a surprising amount of Agility. Tiger items, Monkey items, both are great options.
---
I personally view Strength, Agility and Stamina as similar weight, and go with items with the most TOTAL stats on them. Strength may be better than Agi, but i'd use a 4 Str 4 Agi glove over a 6 strength nothing else glove, for instance.
---
Because not everyone likes PvP
---
You really think NA is going to have more "streamer servers" than servers? 
---
Sounds like someone has a case of fomo lmao
---
Or people were asking where to find the "Stolen Silver"
---
Malice Mizer on my playlist
---
because the site is trash and is made to cash in on classic hype with some ad revenue.
---
"So an interesting find:
---
Mangeclaw is a she. While questing in wetlands with her I was being attacked by the undead sailors on the boats north of Menethil and was getting the curse on me that turns me undead. Amusingly enough, so did my bear. With one difference: my bear showed as a female undead every time she was shifted! I tried being changed with multiple toons, races, and genders, and all of them matched their gender for the undead skin. So apparently the internal gender for Mangeclaw is female."-  [https://classicdb.ch/?npc=1961#comments](https://classicdb.ch/?npc=1961#comments) 
---
I personally prefer Bjarn over Mangeclaw because Bjarn has 1.55 attack speed and I like quick attacks &lt;3
---
It was indeed pretty amazing, but in eu the RPPvP realms were pretty empty-ish aside from defias if I recall correctly
---
Its also pretty bad that they made the old zones useless once outland came out, and they have stayed useless ever since, surely there is a way to keep them relevant somehow
---
Tthat guy's bit is getting so old. Him and Asmon have a funny routine, but it seriously gets tiring after the 30th ironic rage outburst from Mcconnell trying to goad the chat into reacting.  *sad voice "I'm just going to go on Youtube and read all the hate comments about me" god shut the fuck up.
---
I find that extremely selfish. On Asmon's stream, he was asked if he would tell the stream which server he would be on. He said he would keep it a secret so that he can have about 15 minutes of peace before his goons find him. Because of that, thousands of people will find themselves on his server and won't even know it. The evil part of this is that he knows what he's doing to everyone but he's doing it so that HE doesn't have to deal with the issue for the first few minutes. It's incredibly selfish if you ask me. On the bright side, Blizzard has acknowledged the issue and said they may offer free realm transfers to people who get screwed over by a streamer server.
---
Yup, I never vendor those scrolls.  Use them on whatever randos you cross paths with.
---
Keep everything to be safe but the most important herb while leveling is easily briarthorn. 
---
I create a bank alt that I just mail all my herbs to and then mail them all back when i hit 36.
---
Edit: for second part of your question: not sure. I’ve always been ahead enough where I won’t have enough help to even keep skinning. 
---
I would say maybe?  If you can get help then I’m sure it would be better to keep skinning all the way to 60
---
Well Blizzard obviously changed their minds and are going all in on it, so can we back off on this a bit?
---
Never been a fan of the whole pulling up an old af clip with under a different dynamic during the time, just to laugh at this one guy.
---
Old people love to watch people do this shit too, just on tv over politics and not twitch over WoW
---
i havent seen this video specifically, and dont want to but it is generally funny to me to watch people get mad over nothing, so long as they arent in a position of power or do anything violent
---
I stand by my statement. Scarlet crusaders are dudes.
---
And then it abandoned you for not giving it fruits? :(
---
You can play both with a single subscription, tho retail requires the latest expansion to be bought. Id say vanilla, even retail player are mad about the current game state.
---
Meh I don't think there is much of an issue outside of  Asmon and  Soda tbh.
---
do you not understand the difference between reach and hitbox?
---
i’m not talking about the class, i’m talking about him being a permanent flag carrier.
---
This reason alone is enough to never go down the horizontal expansion path.
---
It's almost like a modern version of the old radio shock jock. An exaggerated personality put on for entertainment.  
---
I'm pretty sure Howard Stern isn't his on air character in real life.
---
Best case scenario with high level raiding gear, you'll be a little annoying. The only time someone is going to attack you is if they don't know what they're doing or if you're alone. Everyone knows a warrior with a shield on has lots of survivability vs physical damage, so there's no point in focusing them early. They also know you're not a serious threat. You'll be a cc magnet, or you'll be ignored if there's an actual threatening target near you.
---
You're sacrificing a ton of dps and the MS debuff in favor of concussion blow and imp shield bash vs casters. This isn't a net gain. You'll be even more vulnerable to a caster compared to an MS warrior, because an MS warrior can kill things quickly. Warriors win those fights by surprise bursting a caster in a short window when you're not cc'ed, and your extra armor isn't going to help you vs a caster at all. 
---
+1 for trying to think outside the box, but there's a reason prot warrior isn't usually included in competitive PvP.
---
When Classic releases you'll be able to try both with one sub. You won't be able to experience the latest content in Retail and the associated raids and dungeons unless you pay for Battle for Azeroth. But you'll be able to get a feel for how the classes are and the community is.
---
Interesting! Mama-bear. I love it
---
I lol’d at the first one
---
Mn doesn't talk much but you can definitely learn a lot about warriors from watching him
---
Well, I mean, you literally were running around in circles in ST.
---
Yeah luckily most of the work they put in is now public knowledge. The game only has so many variables when it comes to pve. Their isnt some going to be some secret talent spec or hidden item that no ones has tried. 
---
We have tried every talent combination and most item sets. It will come down focus and consistency. I remember when I was learning about chess that you can only learn so many openers and moves in the game. Most of them are known and have been played. There isnt going to be some new move or combo you can do. What you can do to get better, after learning the base skills, is learn to reduce mistakes. In pvp I make sure I can play my class well. At least around 90% skill or efficiency. That shouldnt be to hard for most people to obtain. What you then have to do is learn how to reduce your mistakes and learn to capitalize on other people's mistakes. And then after all that, learn to force mistakes in opponents. 
---
In raiding you cant force mistakes and bosses dont make many mistakes. But your teammates will. If you learn what you need to about being an efficient rogue and then focus on not making any mistakes you will move above the others
---
They got made famous by fantastical videos where people would AoE farm/solo kill instance trash, but let's us not confuse that with actual gold farming efficiency. There's a lot of lost time between edits in those videos, waiting for respawns, drinking, or running out/resetting. So while they might have made "10g" in 10 seconds, how long did the setup/positioning/re-positioning take?    
---
By far the most important single metric when gold farming: How fast do you move?     
---
It sounds obvious because it is obvious. No matter what tact you take, AoE, Mining, Herbing, or killing high G/H mobs, getting from A-&gt;B is going to be your biggest time sink because you aren't going to afk waiting for respawn. The only exception is when you and a group of friends farm full instances for G/H (e.g. fast Strat/Scholo runs, UBRS, etc).    
---
By this metric you have to consider non-obvious candidates: Warlock (free mount), and Druid (faster unmounted movement, stealth to skip mobs, self-healing for reduced downtime, etc).    
---
Mages are good at one specific type of farming: AoE, and descent at some others due to Blink, but overall they're overrated. Hunters are good across the board due to Aspect of the Cheetah, pet distractions/frost traps, FD, etc. They just have the smorgasbord of helpful abilities.    
---
TL;DR: Mages are overrated. Hunters are still great. Consider Feral Druid.
---
Wait. I'd love to do both Loch Modan and Westfall on an ally alt, come classic. Is it possible to complete both zones without out-leveling one?
---
And 2 who will change servers when the streamer quits or moves servers
---
Try out retail now while you wait for classic. You'll find retail is much faster than classic in leveling simpler combat  Classic will give you more of a mmo experience because for the game to survive players will have to be social with each other.
---
I think you only got +100% damage against Ossarian
---
Are you me?! I was 13 and it was my first MMO, also an undead warrior. Don't tell me you had spiked hair too ;D
---
&gt; but they don't even use pets in raids.
---
You'll typically have your Imp out in raids to give your party the stamina buff. They just stick by your side in Phase Shift in passive mode so they can't die. Not actively "using" the pet, but they serve a purpose.
---
Also, we used to have Warlocks use Felhunters and park them around the corner on the Chromaggus fight, using Consume Magic to help with dispels.
---
Check out Kala. He's a shadow priest. Super chill guy. Usually has around 200 viewers at any given point. I really enjoy his content.
---
Sounds amazing :) I’m hoping to make an RP WPvP guild, I already know what it’s gonna be
---
That maze was easier to get through than the Wailing Caverns.
---
Hulksmash is definitely the gear. Laintime was very skilled. There are few fights of him just two or three shotting someone and most of his footage was full fights and not just crit montage. He often fought High Marshall players and other high rank alliance.  I was always surprised at his ability to rank damage in def stance during enemy cds.
---
If there's even an astronomical little inkling of a chance that he was seriously pissed about this I'd be so happy. 
---
It's absolutely hilarious listening to these autistic screeches.
---
On purpose!
---
Probably changed when they decided to shoehorn the blood elves into the horde. Blood Elves for alliance and Pandaren for horde makes a lot of sense.
---
Sure but you won't be playing on launch day then.
---
Damn, that would be the sweetest move from Blizzard, no kidding.
---
"For the Alliance" and "For the Horde" meant something back in the day.
---
I'm beating a dead horse here, but there was a sense of community that doesn't exist in retail. Every point and every buff mattered in those olden days, and people took their classes and roles seriously. It led to shit like this.
---
Some total G walks by and in outstanding courtesy, buffs every person (s)he passes with whatever they can. Builds 'em up.
---
As a Lock, I'd randomly soulstone the lowest level person questing around me whenever I could. I hardly ever died out in the world, so I didn't need it... but I'm sure that res came in handy for those who did. Sometimes when I was studying or watching a movie... I'd sit in town and hand out free cookies, too. Had to pay forward all those buffs, Mage food and ports, etc somehow.
---
Multir1hunter here. To understand how this issue is being caused; checkout my post
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bs7ks2/melee_leeway_retail_mechanic_in_classic/
---
is classic not released ??? so many people are playing it
---
Dude, come on. Maybe he started like that but you can see immediately that that is his true self. Idk what to tell you, kid's a jerk. It's not 4d chess lmao
---
The Person with the buff
---
There's like 3 buffs now.
---
Strength/agi, stam, and int. That's it nowadays lol.
---
Agreed, 17 hunters are underpowered in Classic. Needs changes to be Pserverlike.
---
Then warrior is definitely a good choice.
---
I disagree so much with this, one of the biggest problems with retail right now is how easy you can get BiS for content that you don’t even do. PvP giving some of the best gear for M+, M+ giving some of the best gear for raids and raids giving some of the best gear for PvP.
---
I really like having 2 sets of gear, 2 sets of progression, 2 different things to gear. In retail you have 0 things to gear because there are 3 very easy ways to get the best possible gear for all occasions and you never have to target anything, in an ideal world I would want them to bring back resilience but also add something similar for M+ so spamming M15’s which people can do in their sleep is not far more effective for raid gearing than actually raiding.
---
of course not, but just cause the probability is low doesn't mean it's not a possibility, sounds like someone has a case of stupidity here
---
Gold was very hard to come by in vanilla. I afforded my epic mount early by taking double gathering on most characters (usually mining and herbalism) and then selling/playing the mats on the auction house.  
---
Once I was rich enough, I occasionally indulged in engineering or tailoring/alchemy on any given toon. Crafting professions are sometimes enjoyable and useful, but they’re mostly an easy way to take your gold, few will make any profit. 
---
Dungeons and raids will nearly always have better loot than crafting, and much of the epic crafting patterns you’d want at end game are hidden away in dungeons and raids anyway.
---
Oh not brushing off Theorycraft, I'm always one for experimenting and using maths.
---
The issue here is that it's not a direct comparison: 1 rage every 3 seconds vs 1% more total damage. To me at least, this isnt even close, and the 1 rage every 3 seconds is worth far more than 1% damage, but someone can always come up with that "what if you hit someone with 100 health left and get a 99, that 1% would have killed them".
---
PvP is much harder to theorycraft than PvE because you cant just mathematically say "X does more damage in a fight ergo is better". In most cases though, it's usually a better idea to sacrifice damage where you can for CC, Utility and Survivability as long as it isnt large damage amounts. Also, burst damage trumps sustained damage in PvP.
---
If 1% damage was that vital to PvP then you'd see a lot more glass cannon builds. I only mention other guides and theorycraft simply because Classic is a game with a huge amount of players, guides are common, players HAVE done lots of experimentation and most of them have passed on the advice that Anger management is going to help your performance far more than 1% more damage.
---
I'm all for people using whatever spec they want, as long as they understand the power and use of talents relative to one another. If your personal playstyle feels 1% more damage is worth more than a constant 1 rage per 3 sec tick then so be it, everyone plays differently. 
---
The main reason I highlight Anger Management is that it is an incredibly strong talent for 1 point and it has an INCORRECT TOOLTIP so many warriors skip it thinking it's crap and only works out of combat, without realising how much it can help within combat. By all means choose not to take it, but choose not to take it after being informed that you know what you're giving up.
---
I thought shield slam was more threat than sunder?
---
What are you talking about? People have been saying that since vanilla and never once has there been proof of a single person being banned for it.
---
What can get you in trouble is intentionally grieving someone (ie: pulling a bunch of mobs onto a player over and over again) but that has nothing to do with PvP between factions and ganking.
---
Wait did I hear you mention, Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker?
---
Yeah that's exactly the point though: this possibility ^^
---
Based on some searching, it seems like most sources point to \~1.5 million at launch in 2005, which is admittedly way higher than I thought it was. Unfortunately, we don't really know WoW's current population. Some estimate 3 million, I've seen some as high as 7. In order to make any claims, I'd have to do a lot more assuming, but at this point I am confident in saying that my claim of a "fraction" may not be as big of a difference as I thought.
---
Piggy backing off this - in raids you usually won’t even be invited as Arms due to the MS debuff not being desirable. So that’s a huge con on arms.
---
I don't think its necessary to keep the player base together unless were dealing with a very small community. If there are 100k people playing classic and 70k move over to BC its not like classic is going to collapse, that's a healthy playerbase to keep the game running smoothly. 
---
I don't want to play a tweaked BC, I want to raid Karazhan again and run heroic Mech everyday for tokens.
---
That's not guaranteed, they might do some! depends on the demand, I hope there's one at launch for you guys :(
---
* vanillawowdb.com is the [current biggest pserver which I can't name because of subreddit rules]'s database.
---
* classicdb.com is Nostalrius' database
---
* classicdb.ch is an antiquated pserver database and is, as far I as know, stock mangOS values
---
"identical to the vanilladb values" doesn't mean shit when you're comparing pserver A's database to pserver B's database. I'm not sure what "vanilladb" is supposed to be. In fact, "vanilladb" isn't even a WoW thing, it's a github page/its own website that's not even related to Classic or world of warcraft.
---
That will ruin PVP though.
---
Casual shitkid, go back to some pay2win game you play
---
okay buddy :)
---
Get a Naga Mouse or something similar and use Bartender to setup your bars to match the Thumb Button layout like this. https://imgur.com/VRgoc2r This gives you access to massive amounts of abilities and in an easy to remember layout.
---
It's not asinine. It's fine not to like it, it's a different appeal but it wasnt a random pointless change. The devs have good logical reasons behind the change and we shouldn't forget that classic and retail are the products of the same team. Retail was designed to be how it is. Classic is being designed to be the way it'll be. All if these decisions are for a reason.
---
Who's problem is that....
---
Indeed, as already discussed the gnome highlight was a great one.
---
In regards to the weapon skill, I didn't know it didn't matter. I thought I had read it was "Maxed in PvP". Humans have a higher "Max" hence the increased effectiveness. If this isn't the case then my original comment is less valid for PvP.
---
I always recommend switching to arms as soon as you get ww axe, impale, sweeping strikes, and the damage range just wrecks everything.
---
Really depends on you blowing a significant portion of your mount gold or having good friends to help you get it early though
---
Once again, agility would be more important than str here as the crits would be vastly superior.
---
Russian are only a thing in retail cause of cross servers, they have their own servers bud
---
Dude just send all skins / herbs to bank alt and auction them so much more gold
---
Ever thought of making a gold guide for wow? Or are you aware of any good ones to get ahead start in classic?
---
Think you mean Final Fantasy VIII cause everyone knows that Triple Triad was infinitely better than Tetra Master.
---
Fair enough, you're probably right.
---
 If shoulders have +5 agi and Stam vs your current shoulder with +3 Str and +4 Stam the former are probably the better option.
---
Which was sort of not true IIRC...
---
It was already in the pipeline.
---
GW1 did have some form of power creep come up though. In the form of new abilities introduced that you had to snag from mobs iirc. Some of them were leaps and bounds better than many other abilities.
---
You’ll find a lot of folks running to 60 ASAP, and a smaller number who stop and smell and pick the flowers or dark iron, so to speak.
---
I actually like druids a lot but I don't want to heal. And let's be honest feral or balance is just not going to do it in raids. 
---
Might have to go hunter then, they seem to be the safest bet. We are still not 100% sure how instances will work (aka how easy will it be to reset them or what abilities mobs might have).
---
Increase it in 5-10 level increments and watch the rat race continue ad nauseum until release. The hype would be at a fever pitch
---
Yes, this is another problem with all these horizontal expansion ideas.  Any meddling will take the game towards the homogenized theme park and away from the wild West.
---
I'm a big pvp guy, but I'm *not* a big arena guy, that's why I hesitated to put them down as a pro OR a con...I know they are very polarizing.  Personally, I don't like the sterility of it, and I don't like the fact that for a given patch cycle you basically *have* to follow a specific meta to compete beyond a certain point simply due to the fact that perfect balance is impossible.
---
layering does NOTHING for starter zone overpopulation.
---
it'll still be unplayable for you for the first few days.
---
FFVIII card game was the tits
---
That's almost a third of a year in a game that hasn't come out. I do not plan to spend a third of my time over the next year playing a game so I get the ability to vote on changes. That's far stricter than the OSRS requirements and would mean the only people who got to vote were the literal no life neckbeard, poopsock, losers.
---
No way... you must be made of spare parts, bud.
---
Doom is a once per minute thing and kind of a waste of a debuff slot and only usable if the other warlocks are maintaining the real curses...
---
Life tap is like saying potions are part of your rotation.  It's interesting mana management but really warlocks are just shadow bolt spammers in vanilla.
---
I went to the comments preparing to see some "meh" level of CN Jokes. I was suprised how wrong I was. Best one ever ;)

I honestly forgot about that set bonus. I don’t remember much group play in laintime’s video. I want to say it was all 1vX world pvp but the stam from those r14 pieces must have been invaluable.

If only recruitment was that easy. Progress logs were often hidden, farm logs don't say anything about the players ability to perform. Good parsers did not always make good progress raiders and a lot of fights could be cheesed to parse. This is just not how recruitment worked I'm afraid, not sure where you got this impression from?
---
It’s in closed beta. Launches late August. Technically vanilla came in November 2004 but the classic initial content is based on 1.12, somewhere around late 2005.
---
it's not like it's morrowind style quests lol, most quests just say "north west of here there's some asshole, go kill him."
---
Yeah, and I mean if it happens that sucks but it's also kind of a cool experience at the same time. 
---
Vanilla is all about those community experiences and idk if it could get any better than on those servers, plus you could just switch if you really wanted to it's not like it would waste that much time by lvl 8 or 10. 
---
I just don't think it's a big deal, honestly. If that's the worst problem I run into on launch , I'll be extremely pleased.
---
you could try retail right now and if classic hits, you can switch to classic to build your own opinion
---
Then the top three mmos will be 
---
1. Wow classic 
---
2. Wow classic retro
---
3. Wow retail

Going into my brother's room and being hit by a strong smell of cigarrette smoke and coke (cola, you fucks). 
---
A few songs in particular, Apollo 440 - Crazee Horse, Halcyon - On &amp; On...
---
Walking around some parts of my neighborhood also trigger some Vanilla nostalgia. I guess it was when I had to play outside with the other kids because my brother owned the account and played most of the time.
---
Exactly, I understand why people dislike him. They just dont really understand the theatrics of it.
---
&gt;Weirdly, for how much people tend to love Stranglethorn Vale, I kind-of never went there. Too intimidating, probably.
---
TBH as alliance, there is very little reason to go there (unless you are a hunter/skinner). Kurzens quest chain is WAY short, and you have to cover it  over an oddly large number of levels. 
---
Please please try Feralas again. As alliance there is some amazing questing there, and you even get to save a bunch of baby fae dragons. Pretty great!
---
Not to mention the "I got a drop!"-feeling when there's like 8+ players competing for that one piece.
---
With how weapon skill is capping at 9 the non human orc races are much more viable now with edgemasters. Still will be outclassed but by a much less margin and realistically for 90% of the warrior population race doesnt matter just mechanics
---
power creep is required for the reason you stated but i dont know how they can keep old raids relevant and add the progression wheel. 
---
i mean you need a reason to raid
---
 I made around 30g selling lesser magic wands for 40-80 silver a pop. Crafting cost was about 20-30. 
---
By the end I had my supply chain figured out and was selling over 20 wands an hour or about 9 gols/hr. Suuper fun. Shame I am EU and had to head to bed 4 hours before reset. Had like 25 sold wands in the ah.
---
Dafran is an Overwatch legend from Denmark. He is probably my favorite streamer of all time and he's been streaming the beta pretty frequently
---
Please explain in what ways they will "ruin" it?
---
Unless you level by only grinding mobs, your weapon skill always lags behind your level. Especially before 40.
---
I started playing vanilla wow since shortly after launch, but i was too young and immature to enjoy RP servers back then. I've RP'd in quite a few games now so I am super excited to level an alt on a RP server. I really hope there is RPPvP for this games launch because I would prefer that.
---
The most monotonous bovine
---
Con: it's very expensive. Gear in time and gold. Most consumable requirement of any role.
---
You're criticizing a made up figure that says 1 line in a three panel comic? If we're being all analytical about it, she's confident, not vain. The real world isn't anime- land where all women are meek and passive. You should check it out sometime.
---
Honestly could you imagine a ticket to a GM "  AN UNDEAD ROGUE KILLED ME CAN YOU BAN HIM ???"  and the GM followed up.
---
If this was the case the game's pvp would die in a month.
---
That’s why I want to play on an RPPVP server, to make a guild that does that
---
This is definitely the best idea when a server is a bit established after the first couple of weeks.
---
If you're starting fresh on day 1 of the server though you wont have any buyers as noone will want to spend cash on lowbie herbs/leather, so in these cases it's best to just vendor most of it for instant cash for skills and such.
---
The longer a server has been up, the more valuable it tends to be to AH everything you find.
---
Several corporations pushing incomplete projects out the door and making employees work 100 hour weeks to make sure shareholders are happy definitely doesn’t  shine capitalism in the greatest light either but I ultimately agree with you.
---
I am so excited to gank Asmongold if my friends are ok with playing on that server.
---
9 is the yellow cap right? But yes Edge is mostly BiS for these races :)
---
What do you think about the overpopulation of shamans showed on most census’s? Should this dissuade anyone from playing based on ability to gear up or find a guild?
---
Thanks!!
---
(For those unaware you need to double the percentage of shams/pallys to account for them being faction bound)
---
Without resilience, everything would be too one-shotty. Classes starting to be able to instagib with AQ gear.
---
Not where that came from
---
Not really worth it. Skins get so flooded so fast and the idea is to have the mount at 40. It’s not worth the auction tax etc. I’ve done this multiple times and am pretty familiar with the fresh server dynamics so you can take advice or don’t.
---
It says mageweave not runecloth? Not that I'd give mine away lol, I need bags. But I don't own any anyway.

Asmondgolds guild is Make Azeroth Great Again? Since MAGA's tend to hate democrats.... How about we go DemoCRITS.
---
The relevant section: 
---
“In order to make both 2h and 1h+s viable strategies for general purpose gameplay, we want approximately the same overall effectiveness in terms of total sustained killing ability over time between 2h weapon and 1h+s. This means that if you were to kill 100 creatures (for example) of your level, it should take close to the same total time including downtime when using 2h or 1h+s, perhaps favoring 2h choices somewhat (although it should be noted that there are intangibles that make measuring downtime a reasonable estimate rather than a perfect science).
---
**While you will kill more quickly using 2h, you are expected to end the fight with a lower remaining health compared to the same fight using 1h+s. In the 1h+s case you will be killing more slowly, but have more health at the end of the fight, and therefore less downtime over the long haul** (and yes, it is balanced to account for the fact that killing more quickly implies taking less hits from the enemy).”
---
Unrelated, but my favourite part:
---
“Finally, if when it was all said and done warriors dealt as much damage as rogues (due to similar rage-energy translation into damage and similar power generation rates), warriors would be flat-out better characters then rogues (better armor, more hit points, same damage), so again, it simply isn't reasonable to draw direct comparisons between the two.”
---
Hmmmm
---
Oh I completely agree that there are plenty of players who would love that. Let me try to rephrase my point:  
---
Will that core playerbase be enough for Blizzard?  
---
My entire post is based of the assumption that Blizzard will want to captivate everyone who is currently interested in Classic and not just the hardest of hardcore. The only way I can see them keeping the attention of the majority of players is by "sacrificing" that core playerbase by expanding and let's face it, WotLK was their most successful expansion so we will be seeing that again sooner or later regardless of them expanding on Classic or releasing it as a standalone recreation.
---
He's actually an extremely nice person. Calm, collected, and just laid back. For a lot of people it's relaxing to watch a content creator that isn't yelling obnoxious shit every 2 seconds.
---
Mm hunters give trueshot aura baby! You're precious to the melee group. And traps are a great way to save the poor warr that pulled one too many adds! And rescue pet tanks too! You're useful in your own way!
---
Gratz dude
---
Then they don't get to experience classic wow, there will be a ton of other games in 10 years
---
\- I dont like that TBC is a new continent making the old zones useless, it seems to make the world bigger, but since we only play in Outlands, the world actually became much much smaller and only made worst by.....  
---
\- Flying mounts, are a bad addition to the game, the flying is not even fun, you just press space to get in height and just auto-walk, but the negatives are HUGE  
---
\- Dont like resilience, dont like how they split players by saying "are you a PVP person? yes, then come this way, if you are PVE person go that way" Its an MMORPG and you are supposed to go through every  aspect of the game to get the best gear, and getting absolute BIS gear isnt something you should even aim for, there should always be room left to improve / upgrade.  
---
\- Dont like that Alliance and Horde have the same main city, i absolutly hated that. But thats just my opinion.  
---
\- I dont like that they made all of your old gear useless very very quickly, the progression is WAAAY too vertical, it should be way more horizontal, thats why in retail people are critting for 100's of billions, same in Diablo funnily enough.  
---
Those are the few that i can remember right now BUT, TBC had a lot of awesome things thaat they could bring into vanilla like arenas and new talents for example, but they can bring them while leaving out all the negative parts of TBC.
---
&gt; That gear should have been marginally better than high 50s greens and quest rewards.
---
I think that's part of the reason the ilvl bloat has been so fucking bad.  The fact that the item levels jumped up as fast as they did between expansions.  I realize that with a tiered progression system (MC-&gt;BWL-&gt;AQ-&gt;Naxx) the loot has to get better or give some sort of progression feedback, that you're actually getting stronger as you move along.  
---
On the other hand, setting the green quest rewards to be at or around dungeon level blues would make the players that went through even BWL massively overpowered for questing, because the mobs would need to be tuned for that gear level.
---
If I'm 2-3 shotting mobs in HFP I'm going to be mowing through the content at a lightning pace. As it stands now, there's still a pretty hefty advantage to those who push end-game content prior to a expansion release, but it seems like Blizzard is attempting to mitigate it.
---
The other problem that was influencing the ilvl bloat is 4 raid difficulties with WF and TF procs on items.  That shit just has to stop, or overlap between tiers.  Maybe Heroic gear is comparable to Mythic on the previous tier as far as ilvl and set bonuses, but with more ideal itemization numbers.
---
Kevin Jordan streams too, he was the lead class designer (someone else did the technical numbers balancing) he designed the skills and talent trees
---
I’d like to see Alex Afrasiabi stream. That guy was a hardcore player before getting scooped up by blizzard and went shy of displaying some rage. Let’s see him 600 wipes into M Uunat and how he keeps his composure.
---
I’m not a streamer and I am yelling and groveling about shitty players who keep dying to bullshit between wipes. 
---
Raging is so much more real that the lawyerly Ion statements (which makes sense, Ion is an attorney).
---
He used to be a dev. I don’t think any of the current ones do. If they did it be worst then asmongolds chat in their stream.
---
O i have bad news for you
---
Source: am undead priest that cant go to STV without getting bum blasted by NE hunters
---
It will give SOME threat - all buffs give some threat. The question is whether it will give enough threat to hold off a healer's healing threat or any AOE dps, and likely not.
---
That said, there's no harm in pulling a pack and using one near the start to get a "greater than zero" threat amount on you, then Demoing them when they get close.
---
Also, if you have 5/5 tactical mastery you can use thunderclap for a little AOE threat, but this is out of Defensive stance so is pretty poor threat. I've yet to see the numbers comparing Thunderclap to Demo Shout though and it can be worth it for the attack slow.
---
And they're percentage based which makes it feel artifical as fuck somehow
---
I think you highlighted an excellent strategy here!
---
&gt;I'll be funneling anything that could possibly sell well to a bank alt, but I expect to vendor most common items
---
Balance vending stuff and saving stacks of Leather / Cloth / Herbs / Lower Level Crafting Materials in your bank for putting up on the AH down the road. 
---
Watch the AH like people watch the stock market. I suspect there will be a big trend a couple months in where many more people are hitting 60 and switching from "Gathering" professions to "Crafting" possessions with money to burn. That's the moment when early / mid range materials will be extremely valuable to help max level players go from 50 to 150 and 175 to 225. 
---
Just because a stack of Leather is only worth 20S the first month doesn't mean that sane stack can't be worth 1G20S the next.
---
Lol tru. Every video at the beginning.
---
Love it! Post more like this; especially the rainy mood ones.
---
does twitch let you download vids to your comp?
---
&gt; "what if you hit someone with 100 health left and get a 99, that 1% would have killed them"
---
This is basically how I'm viewing Anger Management. We can write comments until our fingers fall off but the only way I'm going to figure out which actually wins me more fights is to do A LOT of fights.
---
&gt; Also, burst damage trumps sustained damage in PvP.
---
Apart from the “rounding off” effect I described Anger Management is a talent for sustained damage, not burst damage.
---
Basically what I'm trying to say is I don't think we are thinking too differently about Warrior, it's just that I want to find out from my own combat experience which of these hard-to-compare talents I want most. I really just don't value knowledge of vanilla very high because of how long ago it was, how bad most people were at it, and how much of it is based on pservers.
---
This is the same reason I'm thinking 2/3 Imp Hamstring. It's not that I think having another 5% chance for the proc isn't useful, it's that I'm not sure I actually need it. I remember _regular_ Hamstring being very powerful because of the lower mobility of most classes compared to later expansions, so I'm not automatically accepting more roots as important.
---
Yeah, people forget to account for synergy in your talent system. Sometimes people focus too much on the raw stat bonus and miss out on increased value elsewhere. Cruelty is probably one of the biggest dps increase talents in the game for that first talent row beside the mage hit one and the rogue imp SS
---
I'd rather they just keep Classic as it is and then make a new MMO that builds on the ideas of classic and the lessons they've learned post wotlk.
---
A whole new MMO in the spirit of classic with maybe a different setting would be so cool.
---
try warcraft realms dot com i think
---
That's what I'll do, can't decide so far if rogue or hunter.
---
And don't get me wrong, I don't want to play retail, but I want to play a somewhat enjoyable rotation. They're still much simpler than retail and that's completely fine, all I want is more than 1 button ;)
---
i know you from somewhere, its this your second account with a similar name?
---
What item is that? Bombs?
---
Whilst it's  the "basic" class it's really not a good one for beginners, and even if you go DPS you'll be expected to tank frequently. Warriors can tank dungeons just fine as Arms or Fury spec so often have to tank when levelling.
---
If you're dead set on Warrior aesthetically, go for it. If you want an easier ride on a class just to experience the game, consider Mage or possibly hunter. Rogue might be a good option if you like complex DPS rotations, they get good raid invites and never get asked to do anything but DPS of course.
---
Warrior is a role that requires you to do a lot of research and learn multiple roles, plus often has the hardest time levelling and has big equipment needs. Just be aware of this if you choose to go for it.
---
Won’t happen. And if you won’t even hit 60 who cares just play what you want.
---
What do you mean? I remember when quest addons first came out and a large part of the playerbase were saying that Blizzard should ban them too. They were very controversial.
---
Show her "Make Love not Warcraft"
---
Lol! Oh for sure, but imo those are the biggest for raiding.
---
I highly doubt a big streamer could hide the server they are on for more than an hour, let alone a month. Unless they take a break from streaming (which they likely won't, st launch is likely when they will get the most amount of viewers).
---
9s game was good collecting them kinda sucked
---
Seemed like a waste to not raise them even if it wasn't their main goal
---
Pasta with pesto ftw! Also if you have a small income you'll find ways to make it livable. I have worked more before and earned more money, but all I noticed was that I would spend more money on trivial things like candy, fastfood, booze and so on.
---
His beta stream consisted of him remaking his character every time he misclicked. No thanks
---
Or silverpine forest for the most part, except for SFK. Im starting to wonder if there are still amazing horde places I haven't seen. I solo played on a PVE server as an alliance druid so I thought I saw everything (i still snuck into horde cities). One place that stands out in memory is the elevator in thousand needles and being blown away at the height of the world. Is that still there after cataclysm, i have no idea. But I'll sneak onto it again in classic.
---
Most places...some individual surgery’s last longer than that lol
---
Either strategy will probably work about equally. Like you said transmutes might be a little expensive or hard to find early on, but alchemy is pretty easy to level so I'd expect it to go down fairly quickly. As I recall they're usually only about 3g. 
---
Personally I'm going mining and engi early on. Engi is great for a warrior in PvP or pve. I might switch to herbalism and engi down the road, especially if I get an alt to 60. Picking herbs on your main is big, and demand for ore will go down over time.
---
Also something they could do is make Heroic dungeons.
---
For example, Dire Maul Heroic. Which wouldn't be just Dire Maul but for level 60, but like they could add mechanics and stuff, that could be really cool.
---
If classic is a success and the devs and community agree to adding content to prolong the game, so be it.
---
most private servers had forums with stuff like gold guides. Although not 100% reliable, the bigger servers tried to mimic vanilla as much as possible and those guidelines are certainly useful for the general principles of goldmaking. 
---
you can also browse old reddit subs of those servers on the topic of goldmaking
---
Fuck KD
---
The daily preach he just put out where he ran gnomer was fucking amazing. Dude had a blast getting lost. Hell he got lost before even entering the dungeon.
---
To answer the second part of your question, I’d usually start putting points into prot right after mortal strike, so I can maybe have improved shield block in time for tanking ST/BRD. Otherwise, you can get 5/5 cruelty after mortal strike, and the rest in prot. You can respecc to deep prot at 60. 
---
But if you really know you’re going to do a lot of tanking in your 50s, idk man, do what you want.
---
Interesting, have you had the same experience with mining?
---
Yeah sure, the first time around. Especially with classic being fresh, this holds true. Not sure why you keep ignoring that part of what I am saying.
---
Just a minor thing compared to Private Servers - the /sit to proc Enrage and Blood Craze wont work, which makes Fury a much less effective levelling spec. I think the vast majority of warriors will be levelling as Arms.
---
Yeah I should've put 'OG' devs in the title. Ex-Blizz devs works too!
---
Weapon skills are counted as 300 for the purposes of PvP if you're below 300, IIRC they do indeed increase with racials but as there are no glancing blows in PvP the relevance of it is rather small. Granted, this could be a system unauthorized servers have been doing wrong and finding reliable calculations from 2004-2007 is tricky - to my knowledge on some it doesn't do anything - but even if it does work we're talking less than 1% here with even less relevance depending on the quality of your gear. Certainly nothing as strong as what other races give you (even actives aside, 10 frost resist or 1% dodge + 10 nature resist would probably be better).
---
THIS. You can also level as feral and switch at 60 to be a healer in a balance/resto hybrid spec (NS but no Moonkin form). This spec is great for world pvp after. That way you gear up easily as a healer and that set is being used as your hybrid set for open world pvp as well.
---
\- Balance leveling is not really worth it imo. But you could level as a resto druid and still tank effectively and heal well enough. Druids that go resto are pretty good for group leveling.
---
If you gear up as a tank/feral dps at 60 then you also have a pretty good set for WSG FC feral/resto, which will more than likely be your role in group pvp.
---
Personally, I will be feral the whole way till 50. Hard switch to balance/resto to get used to it, then switch to feral tank at 60. Gear feral set up, and also grab a heal set. Rotate between pve tanking/healing and then for pvp I'll be a balance/resto hybrid and occasionally a feral FC.
---
&gt; raid needed Cloak on Onyxia)
---
Think you meant Nefarian. Onyxia didn't really require Fire resist, unless you planned on eating a deep breath. Nefarian however, would shadowflame the whole raid when he landed, which, if you weren't wearing the Ony cloak, would just kill you eventually.
---
Hey great find. Hopefully this gets looked into more. Though I will say that this post was to show against a stationary target, not a moving one so leeway would have no affect here afaik.  
---
It's been confirmed that auto shot range is indeed 11 yards, which doesn't seem to be intended but finding a clip with precise yards from 2006 is basically impossible. (Clip of frost nova not hitting a NE hunter at min shoot range on beta confirmed it was more than 10 yds)
---
Man, tons of misinformation in one post...
---
Instance farming is certainly not overrated, it's one of the best (if not *THE* best way) to farm gold. It didn't get overhyped because of "fantastical videos", the g/hr of instances like mara princess/DM trib is well known (40g/hr mara for hunter/lock, 60g+ for hunter DM trib, 50-80g/hr mage lasher farming), and that's pretty unbeatable: especially because it's instanced content with no competition and lots of vendor goods compared to AH mat farming.
---
Mages are *certainly not* overrated. Hunters beat them out solely because of how easy trib/mara are for them. In terms of open world grinding, or anything except FD instance runs, mages have much faster clear speed *unless there is competition* and they cannot AoE farm effectively.
---
&gt;By far the most important single metric when gold farming: How fast do you move?
---
Wrong, it's g/hr. That's the only metric that matters. Doesn't matter if you're a slow ass priest compared to a druid, the priest is still going to get better g/hr because they can AoE farm better in DME. 
---
&gt;There's a lot of lost time between edits in those videos, waiting for respawns, drinking, or running out/resetting
---
The only thing listed there that is accurate is drinking. /camp /script InstanceReset(), boom you just reset the instance and teleported to the front.
---
&gt;TL;DR: Mages are overrated. Hunters are still great. Consider Feral Druid.
---
What? Feral druid is OK, they can solo mara, but they're super gear dependent to farm effectively compared to hunter/lock/mage. They are way down the list of best gold farmers.
---
You're putting way too much emphasis on open world farming, which really is only superior to instance farming when you're talking about things like black lotus timer farming or devilsaur mafia. Otherwise, you're going to get less g/hr compared to instance farming 9 times out of 10.
---
&gt;  but do you think you're smarter than everyone at Blizzard?
---
Not op, but i'll answer: of course not. 
---
But I do know this: blizzard fucked up the game so badly, people are dying to get back to previous versions. I can imagine most of the decisions to make the game more "accessible" or whatever probably came from player complaints (which will happen again) and declining subs (which will happen again). So the fear is that classic+ will just be version b of placating whiny users and "features" to try and retain subs. Because at the end of the day, they must make money, and when the "business analyst" looks at unsub metrics, he's going to get approval from management to add feature x to try and capture or protect millions in revenue.
---
Blizzard. There is a demand for these. Don’t make me reroll in 6 months when you realize you were wrong. 
---
Give us RPPVP realms. World PVP on RP realms increases immersion. The RPG immersive elements are what made Classic good. You have enough demand. Give us a blue post confirming RPPVP servers so I can quit fretting over finding the PVP server RPers are going to claim as RPPVP.
---
Signed - A RPPVP GM with enough on plate already.
---
Part of Vanilla is having certain classes that only have one or two valid specs, that won't change.
---
Just play a druid and go Feral if you want.  You won't be as strong as a rogue for dps or a warrior as a tank but you can still do those things
---
What are your thoughts on just holding on to all the mats and shorting the market a month or two down the line?
---
thats funny, whats the story behind it? why shouldnt it be and why was it restored in the end?
---
Does anyone know if scholo, strat, and ubrs will be capped at 5 or will those be 10 man again?
---
Okay thanks for the advice
---
Hunters compete for gear with Rogues, Warriors and Ferals, not Shaman. I can count the amount of ench shaman I've seen in Vanilla on one hand.
---
Any specific ones you’d recommend looking into for a start? I kind of just got back to the whole WoE scene.
---
There's lots of crafted gear that requires arcanite that is amazing for warriors. Lionheart helm, Titanic legplates, stronghold gauntlets, and of course thunderfury.
---
For what it's worth I agree with you. We have a chance to make a very different game but turning it into TBC is just repeating history. 
---
I'd like to see classic get more sandbox content. The gameplay and raid design is limited and pretty meh but the world is unique and open and I'd like to see that be what makes classic special. Especiallynfun group quests. Classic should evolve into it's own thing.
---
I don’t even think you can tame pets higher level in retail but I haven’t touched a hunter in years. Only one on my current account is lvl 18 and my kiddo uses it to play.
---
Edit: I know you couldn’t in vanilla/tbc.
---
Crendor is the king of fluff content, but sometimes you want something with a little more substance
---
Nice!  I worked my way up to 100g with a lvl 1 a few times, but that took me at least 4 weeks. (and I started with a  5g loan)
---
Ya but ST has those statues you have to activate in the correct order...
---
And people who actually play mages know that they're also responsible for sheeping MC targets, iceblock pulling (horde), AOE, and counterspell. All of this stuff comes into play in various boss encounters and difficult raid trash (e.g. suppression room, lab packs).
---
Yeah, there's a lot of frostbolts, but that's far from the whole story even in MC.
---
How many you think have reported it?
---
When it comes to blacksmithing, leatherworking, and armsmith, there actually isn't a ton that you can make off of there.  Most of the stuff you will make will likely before an AH sale or for an alt.  There aren't a ton of things you can just make for yourself.  Now there are a few things of course, but non of that stuff binds.  Meaning when you get the point in the game where you might want some of those things, you can just farm the mats and find someone to make it for you.
---
As far as usefulness: herbalism/alchemy is probably the most useful as people will always need and want those consumables, including yourself. 
---
Engineering can make a lot of interesting items that help you out in both pve and pvp.
---
And of course, enchanting going to be really good as well.
---
You could also go Tailoring/Enchanting.  Neither of those require a gathering profession as back up.
---
OR, you can just go double gathering profession and make money off the AH.  Mining is the most lucrative.  And then I would go with herbalism over skinning.
---
I'm not saying we should, I'm simply saying that if they expand upon it (which I'm assuming they will, Blizzard isn't really know for releasing things without a future) I'd rather see them take an alternate history approach rather than just "preserving" all expansions.
---
Ayy our daily streamer hate circle jerk post!
---
What instance are you thinking of charging 20g a player to run?
---
I took the Myers-Briggs test at the age of 30 and it's results and following meetings with a specialist helped me a lot in figuring out things about myself that I had struggled with my whole life
---
That’s the thing, the community will never collectively agree on something. Blizzard has said that no matter how few people still play classic, the servers will stay up. Either way they will make a certain group of people unhappy.
---
Engi shield and sapper charges. Engi resistance trinkets.
---
Yeah I can see that point.
---
There are two tricks (that come to mind rn) of how to use your pet as a hunter while levelling.
---
-Send in pet to agro all the mobs around a chest/quest item spawn while you loot it.
---
-Send in pet on first mob to get a Growl, send pet on next mob while u finish off the first. Add in a third pull and Beast Scare it for maximum tagging. Repeat.
---
Besides that, a good hunter on 5mans will send his pet to protecte clothies that pulled agro. I haven't done a Vanilla raid in over a decade so i honestly don't remember what it took, but i did use my pet to hit things.
---
Too bad he shrunk into a puppy bear  :D
---
Having fire protection potions is pretty big for p3 in those first weeks.
---
&gt; it slows you down a ton. 
---
I made the calculation a few weeks ago.
---
From memory : if you only grind same lvl beasts to reach lvl 60, you kill something like 14 or 15k mobs.
---
That would add less than 12 hours of played to skin them all.
---
Since you're going to quest and kill humanoids too, I don't think it'll add more than 3 or 4 hours.
---
Not getting the mount at lvl 40 will probably slows you more than skinning.
---
He has a irl channel you should check out. What he does on his stream is 100% a show. He found the thing that gives him views amd stuck with it. Check out the irl channel hes actually a well spoken, articulate and understanding dude. When hes streaming hes just an entertainer its very obvious when you see the other side.
---
Just to add a bit more to this:
---
*  Alliance is definitely Human for PvE but most would state Gnomes are the best PvP warriors due to Escape Artist. The human weapon skills are fairly meh in PvP. Dwarves are also better than humans for PvP due to their racial nullifying rogues.
---
* Orc is definitely the best Fury Warrior for DPS, and the best PvP due to the stun resistance. But for tanking you can't really use Blood Craze, and there are limited amounts of tanking axes. Trolls are currently the favored PvE tanking choice due to threat from their racial and Tauren are the most survivable tank, though the difference here is minor and if you plan to PvP at all then Orc win out.
---
One does not simply, beat an MMORPG.. if you have a goal in mind and you reach that goal you may find that being a personal 'completion'. there's a reason people have been playing and replaying for years..
---
I'm now curious as to what your original guild name was...
---
I'd just like to add to this, a blue post from pre-patch 2.3 in regards to eliminating the "deadzone"
---
"We're planning to shrink the min range on ranged attacks to reduce or eliminate the "dead zone". The only point to the dead zone was to ensure the min range on ranged weapons was enough such that ranged weapon attacks wouldn't be used while also being melee'd (at least by mobs... players have a bit of slush built in). "
---
Note the last bit about "a little bit of slush built in". It's hard to know exactly what they meant by this, but based on the context it sounds like leeway was in some form also in TBC.
---
As for raiding, if youre a druid, you will mostly be using healing touch.. And your regrowth and rejuvenates are scarcely used except for  raid heals. You can also get away with a balance/resto hybrid spec raiding.
---
You're right, had Onyxia on the brain. Fixed!
---
Not to bash, but you would be a bad game designer. Do you drive a opel asta?
---
Cant we just have be there forever without anything after naxxx and let us live in the dream without the stress for new content!!!!!
---
How? Polarity Shift buffs your damage by 10% for each player near you. You can get 19 stacks for a total of 190% increased damage.
---
I dunno about that. A certain private server has seen a population of 12k+ since beta came out despite Naxx having been cleared weeks ago. There will always be new people coming in levelling new characters.
---
In the context of classic I think they should just add dual spec.  That at least doesn't punish healing classes for being healers without actually requiring rebalancing/reitemizing anything.
---
And? [So do people who think astrology is accurate.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnum_effect)
---
Makes sense I guess. Queues + transfer.
---
I used to love finding people AFK on their flying mounts. Just fly above them on the mage, dismount, cast slow fall, then POM+poly them off their mount and watch the helpless little turtle go plummeting to the ground.
---
**Barnum effect**
---
The Barnum effect, also called the Forer effect, is a common psychological phenomenon whereby individuals give high accuracy ratings to descriptions of their personality that supposedly are tailored specifically to them, that are in fact vague and general enough to apply to a wide range of people. This effect can provide a partial explanation for the widespread acceptance of some paranormal beliefs and practices, such as astrology, fortune telling, aura reading, and some types of personality tests.These characterizations are often used by practitioners as a con-technique to convince victims that they are endowed with a paranormal gift. Because the assessment statements are so vague, people interpret their own meaning, thus the statement becomes "personal" to them. Also, individuals are more likely to accept negative assessments of themselves if they perceive the person presenting the assessment as a high-status professional.

Finished in 6 seconds. It’s been 15 years and I’m still stuck in Wailing Caverns.
---
Developers aren't the problem. Management guides the company. And when money is on the line, decisions will always tend to favor the bottom line over everything else.
---
&gt;absolutely impossible to keep mining/herbalism on par with your levelzone
---
From my Vanilla memories it's absolutely true for mining, but I don't think it holds for herbalism.
---
There much more herbs than mines.
---
Hunter has a very high raiding skillcap. The best hunters are even managing their pet during fights to keep it alive while attacking the boss from the back when possible.
---
The value of mining vs herbalism seemed much much less in almost every server launch I started on. It would get flooded and the prices would be insanely low but would stay low for a long ass time. To be totally honest I never fully tracked mining trends on the AH
---
Yea should have said vanilla db I guess :)
---
Alright I didn't watch that whole video because 13 min is too much to ask of me, but I skipped around, listened to some general points.
---
Seems like he's using the excuse, "You have a different face for your work, grandma, friends, etc." Totally true. His streamer face is arrogant and childish, from what I've seen. Doesn't mean it isn't an equal part of him and it doesn't mean that part of him is free from criticism or hate.
---
He says something like "Entertainers exaggerate so that everyone knows what's going on." He thinks his audience is too dumb to understand unless he exaggerates? I honestly have no idea the age range of his audience but are they children? I figured wow twitch viewers were mostly adults. His argument here feels improvised.
---
Compares himself to Letterman and Kimmel. Won't give him too much shit for this because he's speaking off the dome but, yeah.
---
We have to agree to disagree on this one. Even in that video, where I can only assume he's being a more sincere, true self, he comes across as pretentious. The video is literally him explaining something that he thinks the audience doesn't understand. It's framed as "my thoughts," but quickly it becomes explaining down because that's his personality, and that's what I picked up on through his "character" and watching him "perform." He might be putting on a face or whatever, but you can still distinguish his underlying personality. Condescending maybe? Can't think of the right word but that's pretty close.
---
Hmm, if we'r here just to discuss this assumption, I can't comtribute shit.
---
I just think that instead of trying to drag more players to Classic, they'll instead try to make BfA more attractive to the Warcraft fans. They managed to save the game's face after WoD, they can do it again after BfA, because currently they have a big problem of image going on.
---
After all, Retail is the one where they can sell expansion boxes.
---
They should provide a list of servers that they MIGHT join, and a list that they WONT join. That way they retain some mystery, but allow all of us that just wanna play the game a list of choices that are free of streamers.
---
Druid is not totally useless, they are amazing tanks, and offtanks for dungeons and raids.
---
Gearing will be hard to get str and stam, leather pieces, but it can be done.
---
Cat is not bad too, only for PvP I would say.
---
So yeah, not useless just hard to gear.
---
It gave me the 90% load bug for about half an hour. When it worked again, I think I was just back in Org. I guess there were a handfull of spots that did that. I always thought it was funny though. That's what I get for logging out somewhere I know it's being destroyed. 😂
---
Yes you can weapon swap. Useful for hybrid to switch to healing weapons too
---
Unless it's a pserver bug a raid can line of sight Nefs deep breath inside the doorways where the adds spawn. You'd only need a tank and 2 healers to go out with the cloak during the initial landing assuming your raid is ahead on the spawns to be in position.
---
Here is how I save money.
---
Keep a bank alt or two. I like to auction all kinds of stuff, white items usually make a profit vs selling to vendor. 
---
Look into what skills you actually need and will be using, don't buy everything if you are not planning on using it. 
---
Get your hands on decent size bags, this is useful as you will be able to carry more loot in all situations. Find out how to get your next bag upgrade. 
---
Get a sell value addon. This lets you see what all items are worth, including quest rewards and craftable items. Now you know what choice to make in case you can't use a quest reward. Or if you are crafting white items for a skill up you can tell which item will vendor for slightly more. 
---
On your main character, you should learn cooking. This lets you save a lot of money from buying food and also provides a useful buff. Also, making food to vendor in case you have too much meat or outlevel the food is actually a good idea, as the raw meat is not worth a lot.
---
Also consider where to train your skills, professions or even buying water or trade goods from vendors. Since you get 10% discount at Honored reputation level it might be a good idea to return to your starting city if you have achieved that level of reputation. Another 10% discount can be gained from reaching level 3 pvp rank.
---
That's amazing if they can keep that up, it would be insane to walk through ironforge with 100 people not teleporting all over the place.
---
i mean saying the word chud and crying about streamers being too toxic makes it obvious who you are as well. are you transsexual yet?
---
FF14 has this.
---
Can gnomes ride sabers?
---
are you sure though? I remember having to level lower level pets in vanilla when I got a new one (like when my 60 hunter got broken tooth). I could've sworn you could tame a mob slightly higher level than you while leveling because I remember them not gaining xp until I caught up.
---
Tl:dr
---
Few years back at blizzcon a member of the audience asked if were ever going to get classic wow servers.
---
Dev replied "you think you do,but you dont really want it" something along those lines.
---
Name?
---
comes down to each of us having our own definitions of what 'fun' is
---
i'll see if I can dig some up. I certainly saved some , but those are on a different PC I am not using right now.  If I find anything usefull I'll pm you.
---
I wouldn't see a problem with geared people blowing through quests. Those people could maybe have a way to start questing somewhere else.
---
All content doesn't need to be for all people.
---
If you like world PvP then an RP-PvP server may be your thing.
---
A lot of guilds and groups of players organize events and battles through forums (now I'm sure each server will have a discord)
---
This is actually exactly why agility is so much more important. On top of that - even without using the /sit macro (which I NEVER did - even on pservers) fury is still the better choice. Some of the fastest leveling warriors like Gilnash even suggest staying fury (but he does abuse the /sit I believe so) even to 60. However in my experience MS and SS is just too good to pass up. You end up doing a one mob rage build - 2 mob rage dump cleave over and over. It’s fantastic. But fury up to that point is still far better.
---
The account was banned and while it was banned someone requested the name, it was supposed to be a permanent ban so I guess the GM renamed the character that. 
---
I recovered the account and filed a ban appeal and they unbanned it.
---
2 years is realistic for the original game
---
Undead cant be druids
---
I wont be playing it 15 dollars a month is way 2 much for an old ass game with 0 updates in the future
---
For classic, best race to do druid as, is definitely gnome. 10/10 best racials
---
Resistance fights were cool when itemization was still interesting. 
---
It’s interesting to have to tailor make a set of gear for a specific fight. The interplay between picking up stam/resist vs giving up straight dps gains all while managing your negative stat—hit—is interesting.
---
There hasn’t been a fight I’ve swapped gear out for on retail for years. Excepting bfa. 
---
As much as I dislike Azerite, it does create situations where o throw on different pieces. My spriest has a single target and aoe set. Generally I use the ST one in raids and the aoe one in mythic+. But some fights (opulence) has me in my aoe set.
---
TLDR hit and resistance made gear a constantly interesting question and not simply “take the higher ilvl” as it is for nearly everything in live.
---
Contorted
---
Is everyone in the world connected to one server for this? Once they divide the servers up based on regions I bet it will be alot better
---
I have vague memories of spending a lot of time in Arathi on top of the stables building and getting on top of the home clocktowerish buildings.
---
I do know there was a way to get on top of the night elf towers in the alliance side roof area. But I think that required a priest levitate and mounts.
---
Good question.. lol
---
Pokimane and shroud are in it, nuff said
---
Highwarlordstino
---
Delusionnnal 
---
Kainecow
---
Or me (mr_turley) if I'm allowed to toot my own horn. I do world pvp and BiS gearing on an alliance druid ;D
---
Its obviously your problem, im just saying having a few friends isnt the same as having a legion of loyal fans.
---
Xaryu is also a great mage streamer.
---
There's the transphobia I was expecting. Thank you for playing your part.
---
it does exist!
---
https://classicdb.ch/?npc=3581
---
Say late-October. At all costs avoid committing to a year.
---
questing and dungeons are two different things
---
unless you mean questing \*in\* dungeons, but we know that group finder specifically put quest-givers at the start of dungeons for convenience
---
either way, have a pedantic internet point
---
I.agree old shit for 15 a month what a joke they blizzard knows most people are dumb enough 2 pay
---
I do believe it's been said there will be at least one of every server type.
---
Normal, PvP, RP and RP-PvP
---
Xaryu for mage.
---
Europeans should have to wait 80 days before Classic launches in their area. #nochanges
---
Roll Need The Classic Wow Adventure. On YouTube and iTunes I believe
---
Part of it is the potential for best alliance minmaxed DPS and tank too *shrug*
---
Bjarn actually has a 2.0 attack speed, at least according to all attack speed lists.
---
For your alts there are 3 professions to consider:
---
1. Alchemy because of transmutes. Mainly Arcanite Bars which always will be in high demand due to their 1 day cooldown and being part of most high level epic blacksmithing crafts. There are also things such as transmuting essences where you can turn the cheaper ones into more expensives ones. Depending on current prices what's more profitable (between arcanite and essences may change)
---
2. Tailoring because of Mooncloth. Once each 4 days you can turn x2 Felcloth into Mooncloth. This will be particularly profitable once Phase 4 is out and the Bloodvine set from Zul'Gurub is availble. Prior to AQ40 some parts are BiS for casters and a excellent alternative for fresh 60s. 
---
3. Leatherworking because of refined deeprock salt. You buy the Salt Shaker from an engineer letting you make refined deeprock salt once every 4 days. This is needed to make Cured Rugged Hide which is a reagent for some strong BoE epics (Corehound Belt, Hide of the Wild, Shifting cloak) aswell as leather and mail frost resistance items once Naxx is out.
---
Having 2 of these professions will passively grant you a decent sum of gold. However you have to take into account the amount of hours it takes your alts to get going. Most likely it's worth more if you can efficiently farm during that time. But this is an alternative for people that don't enjoy farming.
---
Why is it better? (Where is the difference) (thank you for awnsering my question 😁)
---
I heard the opposite in one of the interviews on YouTube. They said they would have at least one of all server types
---
Inb4 "white stain" joke
---
I remember some night elf one on a menethil harbor boat with x gonna give it to you
---
Just be aware that you can't play both factions on the same server, at least on a PvP server, I can't say for PvE servers.
---
I mean this is great but how long do we want to play a game where there are only a few viable specs. At some point there will need to be a balance for the undesirable classes and specs.
---
Pretty sure they fixed this at some point to ignore Line of Sight issues. I could be wrong, but I remember even late in vanilla having our whole raid equip their cloaks.
---
Yea I agree, Asmon is just a prick.
---
See, I can't help but remember Apes involvement (even if indirect) with the Devilsaur mafia on a certain P.Server. 
---
Now, I'm sure the members of Apes are fine folk, but said involvement leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I wish them all the best but I won't be tuning in.
---
Wait is gnome druid actually a thing? Is undead druid a thing too? I thought this was b8 so I responded with some of my own. But in seriousness classic classes for druid are just nelf and tauren
---
Sorry for the misunderstanding I like the squishy rogues, I hate that they gave everyone a heal and everyone can do everyone's job now.
---
I feel that if they want to "fix" a class it should be done toward gear and enchant rather and mechanic patches. 
---
You're a rogue and you want to heal, ok fine use bandages. You want MORE heals, sorry but you'll have to sacrifice something glove enchant that have a on use effect +heal over time, replace a trinket, gear with special abilities.
---
That's how I see balance, you have a core idea if you want more you work around that core without adding more spells.
---
My main was a rogue on Vanilla, I loved the heal but after a while it felt just wrong. Things became "easy" more main stream and I did not like the direction the game was taking. I played a mage too for fun and the most fucked up thing they did is removing spell ranks... That was just a big "WTF" for me. It shown how disconnected the dev were to a part of the community.
---
Anyhow we'll see what the future holds for Classic ;)
---
I dont pvp server lol just the occasional bg queue- Pve server you can mix and match from what i remember
---
Lol they can xD
---
Pretty sure it only showed percent health, not a health number value, but mods could easily estimate the value fairly quick after a few hits.
---
Isn't Mauradon and Dire Maul far more confusing than Wailing Caverns?
---
&gt; Instance farming is certainly not overrated, it's one of the best (if not THE best way) to farm gold.    
---
Wasn't something I said. I said exactly the opposite. It is the only high efficiency gold farming technique where movement speed isn't the most important metric (pull speed/kill speed is). But for solo instances, if you take a lot of setup/positioning time you can still be inefficient.  
---
&gt; Wrong, it's g/hr.   
---
And how do you maximize G/H? By being in locations where you make gold. How do you maximize that? Movement speed. Thus movement speed is the best way to assure highest G/H returns. If you're gathering, AoE farming, or whatever getting localized is the key.    
---
&gt; priest is still going to get better g/hr because they can AoE farm better in DME.    
---
Priest cannot AoE farm shit. Holy Nova was one of the most inefficient AoEs in classic, because half of the allocation went into healing rather than damage.
---
Oh, I'm not trying to say it should be even for everyone, just that Blizzard seems to have the philosophy of expac launches to be a bit of a reset button for the playerbase.
---
I used to raid with Esfand when he showed up honestly had no clue what he was doing 90% of the time and did less damage than tanks on more than a couple fights.
---
&gt;it's not entirely difficult for 1 character to completely take over a single market **for a time.**
---
It can be done for a short while, however as you push the price higher and higher, you will find more and more people willing to farm and list an item.
---
I've even seen others that have two characters one setting a false "top of the market" and the second character underbidding underbidders now  inflated prices in limited quantities and queitly amassing a fortune.
---
Venruki is the best I think in terms of skill playing the classic at the moment. Payo and Guzu are just hilarious and definitely worth the watch.
---
i dont hate them, i just dont want to be associated with them in any way. Yes.

orc's get the mighty war wolf!
---
You took 20 minutes to judge him. But won't give 13 minutes to a counterpoint. He addresses pretty much everything you bring up. If you won't take the time to watch it, we really don't need to have this discussion. I'm sincerely not trying to be dismissive here.
---
Blizzard said you can create your characters 2 weeks before release. Guarantee the streamers will do it as soon as they can. 
---
So I'm waiting until a week or a couple days before release and checking which servers they're on before I choose.
---
I mean cdew is a multi rank 1 gladiator and blizzcon champion shaman. He probably will take a bit of time to get better at classic, but he’s definitely one of the best.
---
You are missing the point of Classic, nobody wants these changes.
---
That looks good. You REALLY wanna hit BRD hard by the way. It has a fuckin ridiculous amount of tank gear. And make sure to get the shield out of UBRS.
---
All classes are desirable. Not all specs are.
---
I’d be okay with class rebalance on classic+ servers. But these are no changes museum servers.
---
That said, I’m really not okay with new abilities for classic. The pvp in vanilla is fantastic because there is depth to the simplicity and what is happening is very easily visually digestible. 
---
I’m totally down with getting rid of the debuff limit, tuning bosses as needed and introducing new content offering gear and sets designed to make meme specs raid  viable with the same amount of effort as the “good” specs. Rogues don’t have to farm MCPs to do competitive dps, ferals do, on top of all the other consumables.

Or you play Hunter ... than you can use item, Feign death + swap item to non utility one ... or to another utility and wait 30 sec to load it ... this way as a Hunter you can use more utility items and don't lose stats ... and yes this is strong ... and yes this is one of differences between good hunter and bad one
---
Why would I want to watch a streamer who I don't like's irl channel? I get what you're saying but I absolutely don't want to watch him do anything, why would I?
---
I tried finding his other channel and it hasn't had an upload in 7 months.
---
I'm torn between trying to find old friends and not. Once I outed myself as a woman my experience in the game changed. I'm probably going to play undercover dude again. See you out there with my 'mic not working' ;)

Facts dude, he is a real OG

---
For those not aware, mobs/bosses can only have so many debuffs on them. Likely if your class/spec is not able to provide a competitive DoT, you'll be asked not to apply it to make sure other players can provide a better DoT for more raid damage.
---
&gt;Is that why? I always figured it was because they have hooves, and that was why Draenei can't be rogues either.
---
But a rotting corpse you can smell from 200 yards away being a rogue makes perfect sense.
---
Hahaha, it was just &lt;Frostmane&gt;, since we were on the Frostmane server, which apparently was a no-go for Blizzard.
---
Here is a thought, everyone will have no gold or will be broke, so best way to make gold will be gathering.
---
Mining, skinning or herbs.
---
Eng and enchant is a giant gold sink, do not choose those perfessions at start of the game.
---
If you watch the streams of alpha test, everyone is still broke after weeks of the game being live.
---
So yeah...
---
Can you maybe tell me a little more about tailor/enchant? This was my first choice, but currently I'm not sure anymore why these can't be on a random alt.
---
You want to post the link then to it
---
It makes you think harder about how to properly swing your weapon.
---
If you're more intelligent then you think about it better.
---
I dunno, I've been looking up stuff on youtube (mostly Skarm) and am actually leaning towards starting out with a druid.
---
Top tier levelers, quite good at surviving and outlasting in open world pvp, great tanks in 5 mans, and the handful of raid encounters they can't tank they can provide utility through heals or dps depending on build.
---
I am tempted to start out with druid, and then roll a warrior later on.
---
Was that after the normalization?
---
Well done. You're going places
---
If we raise awarenss of the wow census addon, maybe.
---
I found a few different places that say you can’t tame a beast higher level than you. Nothing in changelog about beasts level.
---
I don’t ever recall being able to tame a beast higher level than me during my time on a hunter.
---
Smart use of mana CD is crucial for mages and drink-walking which is a trick where you can drink walk a bit, then drink again and continue allows you to run at like 80% speed while getting full mana regen.
---
I don't think you can on pve either.  I first played on pve and had to switch servers to play horde side.  Perhaps on a RP server you can.
---
Dwarf Hunters are good, but I think Night Elves are a little better. Dwarfs have stone form which makes fighting rogues a bit easier, but Shadowmeld is fantastic IMO. WSG flag defending with a stealth cat is so good.
---
That being said, play what makes you happy.
---
thats kinda cool
---
I believe he meant 100 days total of wow not just classic. Yeah 100 days on classic would be crazy.
---
Corruption is too weak to use in vanilla due to debuff slot limits. Same with Doom often. Curse of Elements/Shadows only usually.
---
The normalized damage just changed the damage formula to get rid of the weapon speed multiplier. This made it hard to calculate what was better because you could have lower damage ranges actually hit harder than a higher damage range weapon if the lower damage range weapon had a much slower attack speed. 
---
I think what he meant to say is that weapon speed affects the dps of the weapon - which you can effectively ignore for PvP situations. The damage range is all that matters.
---
True, as a druid main, balance and feral certainly felt more usable in TBC.
---
So I guess I'm for some tweaking of classes, but I still think catform should be inferior to rogues in dps, feral druid can still switch back and do a decent job healing (atleast regular dungeons).
---
Sorry, the first few minutes are about his hoodie. Like I said, I skipped around and listened to some parts so I didn't outright dismiss the video. What I see in the video is the same thing I see on stream, just more carefully worded. Like I said, agree to disagree. I hate Trump and I wouldn't watch a 20 minute video of him explaining himself either, just to give an example. I watched several streams of his, gave him enough chances, I don't like him. Easy as that. My response to your prior comment says the rest, and I don't think my point is any less valid for having skipped a few minutes of his defense.
---
I think the data and the personality test is fine, so no worries  :)
---
Warsong should be bug free on release, can we say the same for the rest of the game?
---
Well that was lackluster.
---
Also, seems like a really silly reason to force a name change.
---
1 booming voice or 1 2h spec aren’t as valuable as anger management. In PvP is where the rage decay reduction actually matters the most, so it’s not 1 point = 10 rage/30 sec. It’s a lot more than that in pvp. You have lots of moments where you fall out of combat or take a breather, even in a groupfight. This way, you keep your rage.
---
1% damage has nothing on being able to use abilities that much more.
---
I mean yeah sure in groups it was alright but it feels kinda awful in open world content when you receive all them buffs but can't help the bypassers really :(
---
Besides, I found out through pservers that I love healing and filling more of a support role!
---
It’ll prevent things for about 5 minutes, but it’s going to ruin the server forever. The issue isn’t a couple hundred snipers running around bothering the streamer, it’s tens of thousands taking up 70% of the server.
---
what
---
Night elf, 50% movement speed while dead
---
Yeah I think the combat in bc dungeons was better, but the evocative dungeon crawl through a living labyrinth of enemies ended with classic and brd. 
---
I’m easy on more linear vs more... sand boxy dungeons. Ideally a mix of both. 
---
I like a 4 hour brd as much as I like a smooth linear 30-45 min UBRS
---
Guildies were trying to get hunters together last night to go owl hunting lol.
---
I always welcome gifts from my GF
---
Paladins can't tank 5-mans in Classic. It's not just the lack of taunt, they simply do not have the threat-generating capacity. It's very different to TBC and WotLK.
---
If you want to tank at all, ever, you're going warrior.
---
i aulmost subscreibed and liket
---
You could always put your query in modmail.
---
Time invested in the raid is not always the full picture though. I had similar raid night times - but god damn the time outside of raid was still fairly highly invested. As opposed to retail where you can literally only log on for raids
---
You realize they're the same thing right?
---
Name one circumstance where a player's melee range extends past their hitbox. I'll wait.
---
A bit of both
---
Was thinking like Scholo, Strat or DM
---
[almost positive](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/534914-world-of-warcraft/47510671)  that is just one source from 10 years.
---
Both wow gamepedia and vanilla wow wiki also concur beasts must be your level or below.
---
My hunter buddy who has only ever played hunter says he isn’t positive but believes I am right that you couldn’t in vanilla/tbc era. Although you can do it now on live.
---
yeah i love him poggers
---
I still think Blizzard did a pretty good job with making all spells serve a purpose. It was before any of the ‘skill prunings’, too.
---
Arms is bad for pve because it takes up a debuff slot on a boss. An organized guild will likely not allow it. If you show up in a pug raid and use MS, expect questions to be asked. It's a big no-no. Note that the same applies to weapons with damage over time procs: not allowed in raids.
---
If I were you, I'd probably play as DW fury and use a 2h in PvP most of the time. It's going to be worse than MS in BGs, but it will be great in raids. Then again, I'm not a big PvPer, so I don't put much emphasis on it.
---
Dual-wield arms is absolutely out of the question. This is getting the worst of both worlds. The whole arms tree is designed around using a slow 2h weapon. Overpower, 2h spec, mortal strike, sweeping strikes, these abilities are all made for slow heavy hitters. In addition to being much worse dps than fury, you'll be taking up a debuff slot with MS in PvE. This is not just sub-optimal, this is 100% not viable.
---
You should spec into imp slam if you need to.
---

What is this addon and what does it do?
---
Good stuff

This image could do with some more red
---
Approved for discussion.
---
&gt; while not being linked to from the sidebar or posted on mod deletion comments.
---
The full list of rules are linked twice in the sidebar, once above and once below. However I will update the mod deletion comments to also link them. We appreciate the suggestion. 
---
&gt;OP was also muted for 72h due to this, wonder how he should repost it...?
---
OP was muted from sending additional mod mail, not from the subreddit, because he sent a question that was directly answered via the stickied comment. The continuation of the discussion clogs up the mod mail, making it more difficult to focusing on legitimate questions, complaints, and discussions.
---
&gt; why can't the be quickly updated on the rules on the sidebar list to the right as well, or at least be linked on the sidebar.
---
You see how long the rules page is, it is naive to think we can include everything within the sidebar. The other important content would be lost. Though again, it is linked twice in the sidebar.
---
If they don't announce servers how will people find them
---
Being survive is a melee spec, the extra base health tauren have is only going to help as well. But the thing is that they don't do nearly enough dps as a BM/marks Hunter would so they aren't brought along for raids, unless it's not progression, and don't care about meme specs like survive, spriest, OOMkins, things like those which aren't normally brought to progressions.
---
Kargoz is a good one! Lot of yt guides and streams:)
---
This is a true classic.
---
Whichever one comes after silk.  I'm not logged in right now.
---
What does he do now a days?
---
My point is there were questing addons back then, too. That, or you just alt-tab/print a guide. The idea of banning quest addons is just dumb.
---
They are equal in threat but not equal in rage cost.
---
Shield slam is 20 rage to use while Sunder Armor is 15 rage base or 12 Rage with talents invest into it.  So basically its less threat for More Rage even untalented and has a 6 second CD while as long as you have rage to spare you can simply spam Sunder Armor if you want .
---
This was one of the absolute best machinimas from that era. I think I burned the entire thing to a disc and made it readable for my DvD player at one point too haha.
---
It was originally 3 videos if I recall. The link seem to have put them all together.
---
Edit: Just realized this is just the third movie. I completely forgot how long it was. It's longer than some full scale movies at the time.
---
 Clearly people want some of these changes. Post after post of wondering about tbc and class balancing shows that clearly not everyone only wants classic. I'm just as happy as the next person to be able to play a good version of wow again. But I wasnt ever asking them rereleased vanillia wow. And to say that everyone only wants vanillia is wrong. We wont wow that doesnt suck for a large portion of former wow players that includes all the way up to wotlk.
---
I understand that, but that needs a back and forth and wastes your guy's time, and slows things down. Was really just pointing out soemthign you see on 99% of subs, the rules linked, and wondered why it wasent.

Spell rotation in a raid setting is only a small fraction of the time you will be killing/farming other things. In every other setting aside from raiding warlocks can use their entire arsenal of abilities as they see fit. So if you base your class choice off a fight that takes 5 mins and you do once a week then go warrior it’s the only class with a “rotation”
---
Hunters have one to but to me it’s the most god awful boring thing in the world, but people will hype it up to be high skill.
---
You're simply touting an opinion as fact. I'm not trying to be a dick, but you're saying "I don't like him, I refuse to learn about him, but my opinion is just as valid". I'm all up for reasonable debate, but when you admittedly state (in a very honest way, which is appreciated) that you refuse to hear his side, you're clearly not wanting to truly understand his side of this. Your opinion is your own, and I'm not trying to "convert" you, just provide you with the opposing view of him.
---
Maybe, but what about all the people who played vanilla-wrath before battle.net or who had an account hacked and banned over the years? Just too many variables to not make the metrics based solely on classic if you want to copy the OSRS model.
---
Others have said why, but I’m just here to back up the assertion that rogue really FEELS easier too. You always have a panic button and it’s so much more comfy.
---
Yes, shield slam is significantly more threat. It costs more rage and has a cd though.

Thought I was set on warrior. I started playing warrior in wotlk after playing only clothies from vanilla and I stuck with it through Cata completing Ulduar 25 HM for the ironbound proto drake and hit 2400 as Arms/Ele/Pally before quitting due to state of pvp. I loved stance dancing and moving the group forward in AV in a deadlock inch by inch on the minimap.  
---
However vanilla warrior is missing a lot of things I like about later expansion warrior in pvp - spell reflect, in-combat charge, intervene , intercept zooming between teammates and enemies, even a heroic jump added a little later, and the handy shattering throw.
---
I stick with one character in games putting "all my eggs in one basket" so to speak. Would it still be worth rolling a warrior in vanilla without the QoL utilities added in later expansions? 
---
Wpvp, BGs is my priority and raiding is secondary to get the gear necessary to stay competitive in pvp. I'm actually toying with the idea if I should roll a hunter for wpvp which I never even considered or touched before. And I'll probably look at players that rolled warriors with regret once they start to gear up as we hit later phases in the game as I always envied the warriors sitting in town back during vanilla with their big 2 handers and plate armor.  
---
Really torn if I'm actually up to the challenge of maining a warrior in classic because I love the feel of the class with the stances and still have muscle memory to how the class plays or maybe trying out hunter for the sake of wpvp/bg. I should mention one of my good friends is rolling a priest.
---
I go Marksman spec which gives me a leeway  range of 41 yards. Works well for me.
---
*"WE'RE IN BOYS! WE'RE IN BOYS! WE'RE IN BOYS! GOTTA GO QUEST BOYS! GO QUEST BOYS!"*
---
I'm starting to actually understand the streamer culture, but I'm also seeing that I just don't care for it. The smaller ones are alright because they are interacting with you. It's kinda cool (to me) to ask a stranger a question like "What's that design on your shirt" and they nerd-out about the graphic.  That, plus you obviously share an interest in at least a single game.
---
On the flip side, seeing the larger streamers manipulate their followers into doing their bidding and the capitalism involved is a major turn-off for me. I'm not saying they *should* be role-models, but 10-year-old kids are easily manipulated by "big brother, older cousin"-figures and they're pouring money into you...take some fucking responsibility, ya know?
---
But I'm biased, because the first streamer I ever noticed was...well, I won't name him/her, but they were going on racist tirades and still kept gaining followers/making money. That left a negative taste in my mouth from the very beginning. It's sickening how much negativity he/she has normalized and made it "OK" to say. Even if I say their name, the defense squad will be inbound.
---
Pewdiepie.
---
[Chuck Norris] disenchants into [Solid Steel Balls]!
---
Heres the thing. I dont want to roll on a server and spend a ton of time just for it to die when a bunch of people drop off. The streamer servers wont die at all, but Id have to put up with all the shit that comes with it. Im torn.
---
Can I tell you about my Satan and Lucifer, Crusader365?
---
OP is being figurative, which is why the complaining about his reduction is pedantic.
---
Get over yourself. Seriously. It's been a huge meme for years that Vanilla rotations were 1 button because you're pressing 1 button 90% of the time. So the reduction becomes figurative to show there's not much going on.
---
If you want to think pressing death coil once every 2 minutes is "rotation" then whatever helps you sleep at night aside from your rubber nipple.
---
Mediocre to a normal person. But they have amazingly open and extraverted personalities compared to gamers lmao
---
Don’t get me wrong - I def agree laintime was highly skilled. (Most of the Korean PvP players were - drakedog challenged an entire meta back when warlocks were dogshit for example) 
---
But warrior is one of those classes where after a certain gear point - it’s hard to point and say “that was skilled” because you legit just clobber people.
---
Ends up being less about the warrior skill set and more about the players’ clever engineering manipulation at that point.  Once on target for more than 2 Global’s - that guy is toast.
---
All classes are viable and balanced
---
Yes they can.
---
GOAT major city. Easily the best design of them all.

Naxx Thaddius, t3 mage with flask and worlduffs and everything. But You will have Aggro in 3 sec. :D
---
They feel like they're contributing to the stream like its a warfront. Its a sense of community thing. Then there are those that just want to see themselves on stream for a brief moment in a trade window.
---
I probably would've worded the Guild Message in a less commanding way. The language is too commanding, makes it sound like you should have known that you already should be giving him shit.
---
There are plenty of cases were people have been banned for targeted harassment. It's one thing to go PvP and kill a guy a few times to stop a world boss. It's another thing to target one single individual, have specific nights dedicated to ruining his experience, and only focus on them alone.  
---
It's not about protecting streamers. You would feel the exact same way if every time you logged in you had a group of people that did everything they could to tag every mob before you and multiple people that camp you 100% of the time every day.  
---
It's not about killing a streamer once or twice and moving on. It can easily creep up to harassment.
---
He is the Alpha and the Omarga
---
Sorry, but calling him and idiot because of his personality and pointing out that fact or even hearing about that fact does not make me want to view his channel... 
---
Your argument is fundamentally wrong.
---
What kind of person thinks to themselves, "this guy sucks" "gonna watch him"?
---
A much better summary of what I was trying to say.
---
You mean that many games today are a rush, cashgrab and powercreep? Yeah might be. I don't play these games so I can't tell. I prefer games like the Witcher, where the route is its own goal and there is no endgame. I find games that are build like bfa highly disturbing.

&gt;I would cringe so hard and nope into next week
---
This sentence makes me do what the sentence describes.
---
You, too, are being pedantic.
---
It's like you're too stupid to understand what a figurative description is and how it's reductive - to make a point.
---
Right over your head, goddamn lmfao!
---
It makes that content wasted on anyone that did the end game content. Itd be basically be heirloom gear and it would make it so people just rush to the end. I'd argue that the idea that not all content  needs to be for all players would only serve to fragment the community. If you look at beta, the success comes from EVERYONE sharing the same world. The same few du gens the same leveling zones the same goals. It's so condensed that the community is United.
---
If it's not matching vanilla functionality then it will probably be fixed.
---
But regardless I wouldn't pick an entirely different class for that reason. Battle shout was only one piece of the AoE tanking puzzle.
---
Back when pets actually meant something. Nice work!
---
 Log on servers, /who name, verify level and race/class matches.  If not go next server.
---
Not only is thread super useful but it really gets me SO pumped for classic.  Can't wait to farm with you guys :p
---
Being able to relate to your character is cool imo. 
---
Also - blame blizzard for OP racials
---
Mages have huge downtime between kills, you spend most of your time eating and drinking.
---
It's even worse with bad gear.
---
Lest downtime would be Hunter, because of pet, and all you need is good weapon, gear doesn't matter.
---
Hunters are solid 1v1, there's not much that ever makes them overpowered but they'll certainly be some classes that hate you. They don't scale well with gear, so at around AQ you'll start seeing everyone else's numbers severely outclass your own. Still a fun class with great utility.
---
If battleground PVP is your goal, I probably wouldn't go Dwarf, only because you're often a defender and Shadowmeld can really help. But it's not that big of a deal.
---
There was plenty wrong with class design before the prune.
---
I think classes were best when it was more than just different rotations and role in combat.
---
I never understood the point of watching somebody else acting like a toxic asshole for hours on twitch when you could play the game, make like-minded friends and have fun being toxic assholes together. And I especially don’t understand donating your money to these people, but then again, some sad guys give money camwhores without even getting to fuck them, so whatever.
---
I’m glad I’m from Europe so I won’t have to play on the same server with these attention whores and especially with the people who fawn over them.
---
Rules are linked twice. Once above and once below the abbreviated rules.
---
Edit: I will look into making each rule a hyperlink to the wiki rule, if it will help clarity.
---
You can pull with bombs for aoe threat, but the baseline bombs and grenades have a casttime which is a nono while tanking since you won't block/dodge/parry while channelling.  IIRC the sapper charges are the most used, since they are instant cast.  
---
I think you can also gnomish battle chicken.  I don't think for any hard boss it would be worth losing the trinket, but you can battle chicken for the buff on trash before boss, trinket swap, and still have a few minutes of the buff left on pull.
---
Interesting.  It just blows my mind at the followings that some of these guys have.  It honestly seems more like a combination of charisma/luck/timing than actual skill for a lot of them, not to mention the toxic, pepe/trumping masses.  Turns me off to the whole "streamer culture" big time.
---
Yep, Vanilla. Where a crafted item is not a way to increase your Gear score artifically so you can get invites but rather an investment in an item that you will potentially wear for years.
---
Looking at you Stronghold Gauntlets.
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/KnottyPluckyTigerSSSsss
---
I see your point, but isn't that what all the expansions have been trying to do?  Where would we go from there?  Just re-releasing all the expansions over again?  That would be missing the point of having classic again in the first place.  If anything I would like to see the things that people liked about classic slowly come back to the current releases.  Things that drew people in and kept them engaged.
---
A little unfair to compare the Classic 1-10 experience to the current Retail 1-10 experience. Nothing below 110 in Retail has any real relevance, including professions. On the other hand the leveling experience from 110 in Retails is not any different.
---
Corruption is not too weak in vanilla.
---
&gt;Right now one tick of corruption does something in the neighborhood of 300 damage/3 seconds, assuming you're SM/ruin spec, you're flasked, and you're getting shadow vulnerability. That 300 is a bit misleading because it doesn't include the damage from the instant shadowbolts that the corruption might create, but lets ignore that. With this napkin math, you would need to average \~38 *successful* melee strikes in 3 seconds *just to match* corruption. Not just 38 attacks, but 38 attacks that land.  
---
&gt;I don't think you're going to exceed 38 melee strikes / 3 seconds, except in very unusual circumstances ie. stacking dagger rogues, using hunter pets, melee heavy raids. 
---
Debuff limit is 16 we have room
---
I always went for the Snow White leopard in that area summoned from a quest. Don’t know why. Also....Timber would have been more of a beast to tame
---
I guess i underestimate how lame some people are
---
The lengths they will go through
---
Actually, the safest bet is to just progress into TBC/WotLK or continue creating fresh Classic servers ad nauseum like the pserver community has been doing.
---
Creating new content for Classic, modifying TBC, etc., would undoubtedly be the "not safe" route; although, it would be one that many people would love to see.
---
Wowpop not a thing anymore?
---
You’re a good person 🙏🏻❤️
---
Okay thanks, I'll have a look.
---
Is engi a must? I already need a ton of consumables that id rather farm myself. I dont see thr shield as a must have
---
I’m in the EU so hopefully I’ll avoid them by default.
---
A real grinder. First one in the raid last one out type. A real GM's son kinda guy. Lunch Pails.
---
I truly don't care if you watch him. I don't watch him beyond random clips myself. I'm simply trying to illustrate that he may not be the exact same person he is on his stream. I'm not advocating, only trying to explain.
---
Asmongold is the best. MethodJosh is good too but doesn't play classic much.
---
Why do I have a feeling OP is going to end up getting served divorce papers if he has to ask questions like this?
---
I linked those
---
It's stuff like this that makes me love the classic/vanilla wow.
---
This is quality, thank you for the laughs
---
Such an unfortunate end. That game was pretty sweet. I loved its art and the shenanigans based around it.
---
Its the WoW version of opening a door for someone and vice versa them for you. Its actions like these that make a true gaming community.
---
Dude, you gotta come clean and tell her.
---
Yea because carrying around 4 different sets of gear is loads of fun 🤔. When I realized I needed multiple sets of gear with the right Azeroth traits to be competitive in BFA was when I quit.
---
Thanks for the help
---
And my axe!
---
Yeah, I tried out a private server awhile ago. There was a lot more social/community interaction, but also a lot of toxicity. I joined a leveling guild just to have some people to talk to, but it was terrible. I made a comment after getting ganked for the 10th time in Redridge. Instead of anyone offering to help (like what I expected) it was just people telling me to stop complaining, and various low effort insults/slurs.
---
If the community in Classic is anything like this sub or private servers it's definitely not going to live up to people's nostalgia of what it was like back then.
---
If you get an upgrade of a new type of weapon you haven't used before it helps a lot.
---
I was saying watch it to understand. You were saying his real personality is the same as the one he puts on for his stream. Those irl videos are the proof thats not true. Another guy linked a video on this thread of him talking about exactly this. 
---
Watch or dont watch whatever you want dude it doesnt mean anything to me.
---
They need to implement af filter for this though ;)
---
yeah bullshit.
---
Unless of course the changes are something that benefits them.
---
Example: Layers
---
If you get the chance, KJ has some amazing interviews on Count Down to Classic on youtube
---
Is someone cutting onions in here?
---
Skills what I did back in the day is had my main as a Miner/Herbalist and had an alt that did BS/Alchemy Ended up that my main was the one that did BS/Alchemy and the Miner/Herbalist became my alt later though.
---
&gt;Maybe, but what about all the people who played vanilla-wrath before battle.net or who had an account hacked and banned over the years
---
Small percentage of people too bad.
---
What is a melee what?
---
Hey thanks :) My post was to show both stationary and moving targets for leeway check all clips out!
---
I'd love to understand more about what confirmation of anything you're talking about and also the clip you're referring to
---
Honestly if they kept going with a whole "Classic+" branch of the game, I'd love it if they borrowed a lot from Burning Crusade class design to round out existing specs and balance out general usefulness.
---
Yeah, it was kind of strange. Especially considering that the guild was founded basically right when the server opened and it stayed with that name for probably the better part of a year before they made us change it. I get it, though, the policy is that you can't use lore names like "Kirin Tor" as your guild name.
---
It was also kind of funny because when a guild name had to be changed, their standard procedure was to automatically rename the guild &lt;GuildLeaderName Guild&gt;.
---
Our guild leader's name was Spam, so we spent a week or two as &lt;Spam Guild&gt;.
---
Yea but youre explaining wrong and the argument of everyone puts on a face for work, grandma, other rl things is not valid. If youre an ass at work, people will think youre an ass and not invite to after work drinks. 
---
The dude is an ass, act or not; hes a complete fucking ass.
---
Damn pserver bugs. Guilty as charged
---
I don't think so. I do watch streamers. Asmon, Esfand, MadSeasonShow. But I also see the hordes of people following them around.
---
In retail, it's easy to avoid, they are usually on a different shard. In a game with no sharding, I honestly wouldn't be able to avoid them.
---
Honestly, it's not their fault, it is just the way it is.
---
"Cool names" -\_-
---
Survive is a melee spec? It is.
---
I agree.  I DO NOT want to be on a server where they are.
---
The mandatory $15/month subscription will give you access to bot games, retail wow will require you to buy whatever the latest expansion is (currently B4A) for $39 to gain access to the 110-120 content. The 1-110 content is bundled into the $15/month sub.

Hey man I never said my opinion was fact. I've learned a lot about him today. I didn't know he was putting on a "character." I still think when streaming it's 90% his true self, but whatever I don't care. Whether or not I "understand" his shtick doesn't change the fact that on stream, he's a dick. Or at least, he was a dick each time I turned him on. Even in that explanation video, he's being polite, but his ego is there. He is always leader of the group, playing by his rules and he is the one in charge (and when things go wrong, he gets upset in a very Real and not acted out way). If you make your whole twitch persona like that, there's something there beyond playing a role.
---
I started the post by saying I don't like his stream. Saying he's nice at Grandma's house when not streaming or whatever doesn't affect that at all.
---
This comment is a great analogy for the poor.
---
I'm referring to the sidebar.
---
That's a solid spec. I just want to save you a respec, and not having furor would force a respec really quick
---
Power shifting alone makes furor useful just to be viable in raids and its so necessary to be able to do anything in pvp
---
Gate keeping at its finest right here fellow redditors
---
Hot take, BFA is not for a fan of classic. It's for a new player. New players have a ball in BFA.
---
Im not sure either way. Just went down a rabbit hole looking at petopia on the wayback machine

---
I couldn't find any explicit mention of pets being tameable 2 levels above current level. In the linked guide for owl taming they mention level 9-10 owls (hunters must be level 10 to tame first pet) - so maybe it was capped at current level
---
I mean....sure, Classic will need something down the road , like years and years. The time will be clearly shown in engagement metrics like concurrent characters online, hours spent...the problem is you just assume that will be TBC. it’s certainly one possibility. Another possibility is opening fresh servers. Private servers never seemed to die from a lack of content progression.
---
We'll see how it all plays out, but I'm really hoping that all this talk about 'players being better' translates into more spots for suboptimal specs in raids and dungeons. If 20 people are able to pull the weight of 40, then that's 20 spots that can go to anybody who's willing to show up with a good attitude.

It's the dwarves that go swimmin' with little hairy women.

Dorfs are sexy as hell. They should be the ultimate standard when comparing classes.

Maybe my view is different that yours, no where in my sidebar under r/classicwow rules is linked

If you have any questions don't hesitate to get in touch with us!
---
It's really not though. Retail and classic should have 0 ties, especially not voting rights based on playing retail. Should you also need Cutting Edge to vote in classic?
---
Problem being that many of us cannot come to terms with the fact that we have emotionally invested in our characters, while having burned ourselves out on content, so it's these dueling feelings of wanting to continue to contribute to our personal investment but also being turned off because it's just not fun anymore. The human brain wasn't designed play something or enjoy something at the same level forever.
---
1/29/21 druid!
---
Sounds like bad design then if it forces a player to skip 110 levels to be comparable.
---
And that’s the main point here the design issues.
---
Ah you think The Barrens is your ally? You merely adopted The Barrens. I was born in it!
---
This is not true. Activision Blizzard is simply a holding company and both Activision and Blizzard, among others, are subsidiary company under this holding company. Both companies have different presidents, headquarters, and so on.
---
For some reason people think that they're going to get to level 60 and beat MC in the first month... It's actually the funniest thing unless you play 12+ hours a day it'll take you at least a month to get to 60 and even if you play 18 hours it would take a 4-7 days. It's the slowest grind in the world 59-60 takes about as much time as 1-30 does. Then the people that sit here and think MC will be fast to get 40 people geared enough to kill the first boss and attuned to the raid will take over a month at the least then to get enough people the FR to kill Rag will take at least 2-3 months of hard farming Corehounds.

&gt; good rebuttal homie, really showed me that i was wrong.

&gt; rose-tinted glasses and honeymoon phase, the sooner you realize that classic is going to be a contentless game the faster you can move on.

 "Our current plan is to have RP realms certainly in the larger regions  where we have a range of realm types. I don't think we're currently  planning on any RP-PVP realms in particular, because that's maybe a bit  too small of a niche... but, we'll see how Classic unfolds once it's out  there and certainly if, you know, there's a large population and demand  for that server, for that type of server, that could support it, we'd  be open to adding it. But, I think at the start, we'll have RP as an  available server type." - [Ion Hazzikostas, March 2019 Dev Q&amp;A](https://clips.twitch.tv/KnottyPluckyTigerSSSsss) 
---
I want rp pvp servers more than anything, but they won't be including them in launch, which sucks.
---
The auction house pays Chuck Norris to post on it.
---
Thanks Butch
---
Interesting. How do you explain me missing on an even level target with 6% hit?
---
So what’s your point man? You acknowledge the fact he’s a Druid which means permanent FC in WSG, then bash him for doing exactly that?
---
It's definitely good, but I level with Leader of the Pack instead of going for 21 in resto. 
---
You need 5/5 Furor ASAP. You can choose to go for Feline Swiftness or Furor out of the gate, either one is probably fine but I like getting Furor done with first. Wolfshead Helm is fairly cheap to buy and will last you the whole game if you plan on going powershifting. It's pretty nice to shift into Cat with 80 energy.
---
Once you snag Leader of the Pack you are free to go either into Balance for Natural Weapons and OoC, or go Resto for survivability/utility.
---
At max level 30/21 is amazing and I ran with that for most of vanilla. Works for OTing raids, healing, BGs, best spec for soloing, etc.
---
To each their own! Hes also pretty new to streaming so you could, if you're so inclined, voice your criticism and try to help him improve!
---
I’m in with a few. If that’s the case I’ll leak it, or I assume others will.

---
I see there’s all the classes on here so will this addon even work for classic?
---
Locks giving me (Priest) Unending Breath is *expected*, in the nicest way. It's a knowing wink.
---
I could be overthinking it here. They could add in seasons 7 and more just as long as first six. Seasons are in tact as is.
---
that almost positive source isnt great because its post TBC. they had already changed a lot about pet leveling mechanics by then
---
wHy nO cApS In MIdLlE of naME?!
---
There's one of two answers for this. Either, defining completion of World of Warcraft classic is up to the individual player, or this is not the kind of game where that is expectation. You don't complete World of Warcraft. You play enough to satisfy your desire to play. That is the closest thing there is to completion. Meaning, you burn yourself out. These games were designed for players to burn themselves out.
---
We control how quickly that happens.
---
I'd say if you avoid asmon and soda server which will probably the same, you'll be completely fine.
---
I like this idea, but we don't even have the game yet, we just have more eyes on Classic now than we did back when this question really popped up, after the Blizzcon 2017 announcement. As far as I'm concerned, this conversation is premature, even though it's been on everyone's minds since Classic was announced. Either way, I'll chunk my two cents in, whatever they end up being worth.
---
I think if we were to get new "expansions" for Classic, it would have to follow the Retail progression in terms of TBC-&gt;WotLK-&gt;Cata-&gt;... according to Mark's suggestion. I don't inherently have a problem with that. I just don't think Classic needs expansions. 
---
**It needs new content without the invalidation of past progress if it is to have new content.**
---
Creating entirely new areas in TBC where the quest gear invalidated T3 loot fairly quickly due to the increased level cap and scaled stats solved the problem of Blizzard's weird gear legacy in Vanilla, but it was a surreal experience dumping this insane gear you got from raiding big baddies for whatever they had in the gear pile at Thrallmar.
---
My ideal Classic is that I get to progress to the end of Wrath and be a happy Prot Pally forever. That was when I had the best time in WoW. If we are never to progress to the end of Wrath or we can't risk splintering the community between 4 different WoWs (Vanilla, TBC, Wrath, Retail), then my ideal Classic would be one that adds content later on just to Vanilla. 
---
Things like Hyjal, Grim Batol, Karazhan, etc. being added first and foremost. No expansions for Classic in terms of increased level cap and zones. No "big releases" We just have 1.14, 1.15, 1.16, and on and on until the heat death of the universe. You could even add Blood Elves and Draenei to the world, their areas slapped onto it to fix the issue of Alliance only Paladins and Horde only Shamans (I think it is an issue because I want to play Horde with my friends and tank for them as a Paladin, but I have to roll Warrior for multiple reasons. I understand there are unique balance implications and roleplay/community aspects to having them faction locked, and some people like that).
---
With the scale of the content in patches that they do today, adding in new Allied Races and entire areas alongside the raid tiers and the balance changes, Classic having patch-based progression is a TOTAL possibility. As I said before, I think this is a premature conversation. We don't know what the Classic community is going to be like nor what we really want when we get to farming Naxx.
---
Bring new abilities, balancing, races, zones, raids, dungeons, quests, attunements, enchants, professions, mounts, whatever. Just don't increase the level cap or create new continents that make Vanilla Azeroth obsolete. I suppose that also comes with no new classes or specializations either.
---
This also creates an interesting design issue as they can't stave off power creep at the max level using expansions anymore. Horizontal progression is an option, but ultimately people want gear that makes them stronger, and thus new content will eventually generate power creep. ilvl was Blizzard's solution to simplifying gearing, but it also would help make distinctions between level 60s. ilvl, however, is **unacceptable** and is contrary to the community aspect of Classic, so another solution must be found if power creep is going to be controlled in any way, preferably not a solution from Retail.
---
I agree 100% with Mark on the defined attributes and principles of Classic WoW though. We must, as a community, and with the Classic team, identify and agree upon a set of values that Classic content must have. How you would preserve those values is a game design question, and one they should consult the community about.
---
Oh it is. The only reason those 110 levels still exist is to persuade people to pay for character boosts.
---
Yes, but this idea of making everything for everyone is one part of how wow went off the rails.
---
Everyone on beta is sharing the same world, but I have only been doing the human area. I haven't been to the barrens or the dwarf zones. I could go to teldrassil right now and blow through it. Is that a problem?
---
Would getting upgrades from hellfire peninsula be more important than mitigating the insane power creep that we already know is an issue that plagues the live game?
---
Is this new reddit?
---
Edit: Just realized it is - our subreddit does not currently support CSS for New Reddit. I'm not familiar with it, and was not even aware that it changed the sidebar.
---
You will get banned on retail if you do this. 
---
It's like finding an npc that sells an item for cheaper than what it resells for. You can make infinite money but you will be banned and it will be fixed.
---
This wont be fixed because it isnt game breaking it's just griefing.
---
You nailed why i'm also rolling a mage.  I was a mage back then and i'll be a mage now!
---
This one won't. No addon for BFA will likely work for classic. New ones will need be written, or revived.
---
You can’t kill rag in classic wow.
---
Then can I blame streamers for ruining my experience of the game?   
---
Have all world bosses on farm. dominate the economy. complete scarab lord before anyone gets a chance, premades that dominate and get grand marshal on farm.   
---
I used to play in Vanilla on a guild called Pacifist on Alliance KT. We had the Grand Marshal in our guild. We would get targeted by most of the horde for 2 years. especially I remember a guild called Tribe. So many people tried to get him  
---
Never heard of it being harassment. Even forum posts to describe where he is at. We just dealt with it and handled the horde.
---
Honestly can't have all the good without the bad.
---
Okay... soda and Asmon average 30-40k everyday doing classic shenanigans and those are just two people. There are tons of good content creators also in the thousands. The hype probably won’t go anywhere, it may get smaller in size until the level cap gets raised however.
---
I don't think anyone disagrees on that front. Obviously having people willing to drop everything to help you and even pass EVERYTHING is a huge help even if they played LESS than you. That has nothing to do with the game itself and isn't unfair though, so it's not a reason to complain, imo. It's definitely an acceptable excuse for losing, or even disliking how streaming is going to effect Classic specifically in this day and age, but that is an entirely different subject. 
---
I don't think anyone would be upset with someone for being geared less than a streamer and losing to them, but bitching out of a BG because the other team has a few players that are better geared is a very shitty thing to do and was the main point my post was responding to. Not only are you wasting your team's and the enemy team's time in those long-ass queues, but it's not a guarantee'd loss anyway. Skill and strategy play a huge roll in BGs, and the only way to get better is to play them. 
---
If you leave every time a better team is against you, be it from gear or skill, you will never improve yourself. Even if you lose, if you take it seriously, there is something to be learned. If you don't take it seriously, then have fun struggling and see how far you can go with odds being stacked against you. I've stayed to the end in every one of my BGs where I knew I was going to lose, whether it was for honor or fun. I would never just pitch a fit and leave.
---
The funny thing is, I'm pretty sure Quinn, another big streamer, was one of the people doing this too. So it wasn't even just a case of Soda having an advantage over him, Quinn legitimately sucks and cries constantly when he loses. He specifically is a little bitch, and I say this as someone who was a fan of his Diablo content. He's funny when he's crying, but he's a toxic little shit objectively, character or not.
---
MadSeason is a streamer?

I am just using the night mode I think, I am subscribbed to r/beta tho, do you think thats the problem in the end lol?
---
&gt;who had an account hacked and banned over the years
---
is a small percentage.
---
No but they posted multiple conditions. You cant let everyone vote, most people dont have a clue.
---
warrior is the most fun class, in vanilla or any expansion. if you liked zooming around in later expansions, it's still the same way in vanilla.

pandering to everyone gave us BFA
---
That's your opinion of him, and that's ok. Trying to provide the counterpoint, not win an argument.
---
He plays Classic WoW on stream :D
---
I mean sure, but if complaining that it should be banned was super common back too then that's part of classic too. The idea isn't really that dumb. I remember back then it was a very controversial thing to have questing add-ons, it wasn't seen as dumb to want to ban them.
---
It’s okay.  There is nothing wrong with multiboxing. It’s fine if you don’t like multiboxing also but some times a rare select few number of people take a difference of opinion as a personal attack and get mad. 
---
I am going to multibox a mage for ports and also as my bank. I don’t know if it will work but my 34” monitor is more than big enough to run both in window. Or I’ll just use my laptop if I need to. I’m noting going to farm dungeons or anything just quest this way. FYI to answer the question I don’t have a lot of time to play so I’m guessing my friends will lvl faster than me.
---
Color coding would be beneficial since the banners help orient you. Always go north to exit Uc to silverpine and the xeps from elevators.
---
I know it was in BC/Wrath, and I'm about 75% sure it was in Vanilla too but I'd want a beta player to confirm.
---
A lot of people use gaming mice and pads like the razer orbweaver and the Corsair scimitar. I have 24 key bindings without ever needing to hit shift ctrl or alt.
---
Dump it all into feral, cat and bear is just too good for leveling.
---
Ofc, I’ll go mention it on the r/beta rly sorry for wasting your time!
---
Knowledgeable, sure, but they might as well be ninja looters in my book.
---
Their involvement with the Devilsaur mafia on LH showed their true colors. This game is all about community, and to poison the community with cross faction collusion to artificially inflate the price of Devilsaurs (thus stifling other guild's progression), is both honorless and desperate.
---
Sure, you can say that many others would've done the same in their position out of selfishness, but I still cannot abide. 
---
Other streamers such as Venruki, Preach and Esfan show they understand the unspoken honor between other players - don't ninja loot, don't corpse camp, don't oblierate lowbies, etc. Of course there will still be toxicity in wow, but these guys set a higher standard of professionalism and respect that makes them easy to like.
---
I know right? Need some of this aloe?
---
There’s a good reason I put 30 hours into beta then about 10 hours into the game since launch. I did everything I wanted to in such a short span, I honestly though TF2 was a better game.
---
Chuck Norris once went back in time to attempt to prevent the assassination of JFK. His beard met all 3 bullets in midair, deflecting them. JFK's head exploded out of sheer amazement.
---
First off, if something doesn’t make sense, explain why. Use your brain, be constructive, and don’t emotion-post where you have to end sentences with “so deal with it”. You’re very easily triggered. 
---
Second, you clearly fail to realize that casuals had more fun in early expansions too. Evident by the drastically larger player base.
---
They are doing 1.12.1 but calling it 1.13 iirc, so i think you should be able to. Lemme google it quick- if anything ill just move my shaman to a diff server
---
Its what makes this video game fun. Less intervention and the more interaction the better. I'm also a fan of EVE which is basically the wild west of pvp.
---
Well when the first guild gets into MC after 2-3 weeks in Greens/Blues and can't beat the first boss it'll be a wake up call.
---
To play devil's advocate here:  A streamer server should ensure the server remains high population several months down the line.  I don't know about you, but playing on a dead low pop server is the worst.  I'm sure every server will be high pop for awhile, but months down the line?  You could bank on the soda/asmon server (if they play together) as always having a ton of players.  I'm expecting a massive launch, and also expecting a big fall off 3 months when 70% of players realize the 60 grind isn't for them.  So if they open with 20 or 30 servers, who knows what it'll be like 3 or 4 months later.
---
Sadly, I think this extends to 20 and 30 year olds too, though probably to a lesser extent. It's pretty sad, because a lot of the useful shit is just crafting materials or pots. ANYONE, no matter how shit of a player, can give a streamer plants, ores, cloth or pots and all of them would be super helpful to have.
---
I agree! also I don’t think anybody follows MadSeason around haha luckily his fanbase isn’t as insane as Asmon/Esfand.
---
They should do what the guy said, remake TBC but without flying mounts etc
---
Any insight onto mage vs lock?
---
Annoyingly enough its pretty freakin big the last few things I looked at. Humans or very very human-like races (I.E. Elves) tend to dominate in the playerbase provided the inhumans don't have significant advantage statistically.
---
The players wanted flying mounts, dungeon finder, easier raids. These are all QoL features that were specifically asked for.
---
The monkeys are *already* running the zoo. That’s why so many of us want to go back to classic.
---
I honestly don't recall it either but there were 2 hunters in a group I was in on the stress test that were taming Savannah Huntresses in The Barrens that were level 11 and 12. They acted like it was normal.
---
&gt;Arms is bad for pve because it takes up a debuff slot on a boss.
---
I recall them implementing a priority system midway through vanilla where weak debuffs like Deep Wounds would never override or push a more important debuff like Sunder Armor off.  Do you know if anyone has tested this aspect on the beta?
---
Gotcha. Thanks for the summary
---
If you played back then, then you would realize that a streamer getting scarab lord early was the exact same as it was in Vanilla when a guild (or guilds) did the same thing by funneling to one person.  
---
If you can't see the difference between a horde guild making a lot of effort to take out a Grand Marshall and some random kids annoying a streamer just to make him miserable, then I don't know what to tell you.  
---
You can easily just not watch a streamer and it will almost never affect you. If you are good enough to get Scarab Lord and have a large enough backing to beat other major guilds, then a streamer won't be a problem.
---
I shouldn't say it is "your end" - it's technically our end. However we have not updated the subreddit to support r/beta and don't currently have plans to. However we will still take your recommendation to link the full rules in the removal comments, so it is more transparent.
---
it does give threat, but the threat is based on how many allies (including pets) that you buff and split among all enemies you're in combat with.
---
I’m not so sure, the gfx are turned all the way down
---
That may be the case. I won't be able to tell until I'm playing the game again.
---
Did you mean Booming Voice though? I can't take points out of Booming Voice because I need them to reach Enrage.
---
Gotcha, misunderstood the purpose
---
It's a trap! ;-) 
---
(But i guess you already know that)
---
It was my choice to be in the beta in the end, I take ownership lol
---
Paladins can tank 5 mans perfectly fine. If anything Paladins are superior to warriors because their threat gain on an AOE scale is way better than warriors. They simply cannot tank bosses very well. Which means they're generally not needed in raids. BUUT you can also make an argument for a paladin off-tank for adds in sub T1 guilds. Depends on how hard you want to go in the game.
---
Agreed 100%, i'm not really interested in a TBC server. Would love for them to continue on with classic and expand.
---
Well my friend then you took the bait, which was the entire point. That’s his sort of humor.
---
He literally addresses this in his video. He says "Am I a different person on stream? No, I just amp it up to 11" Or something to that affect. He's a million times more self aware than you think he is.
---
Esfand, Tipsout, and StaySafe is all you need. ClassiCast FTW
---
You are correct, gaming has changed. People would rather watch other people play video games.
---
Fury tanking was not possible at level 60. Not even end game dungeons they were literally glass canons in leather because plate stats were trash till AQ-20/AQ-40/ZG
---
Is it really a travesty?
---
But then why do it? If you're already 60 and the new continent doesnt give new levels or better gear or something then why do it? If the gameplay was great I'd see the arguement but it's not. It's not like a new Mario stage on Mario maker.
---
&gt; It’s not about the size of the warrior in the fight, it’s about the size of the fight in the warrior. 
---
Damn... that's good.
---
“Classic gewd bfa baad”
---
What a new and exciting post.
---
Or abandon all thought of joining the sissy alliance!
---
you don't know what gate keeping is lmao
---
if you honestly think asmon is going to farm the thousands of silithid carapace fragments it takes to get to neutral with Brood of Nozdormu you're probably biased and a loyal viewer. cause there's no chance. he's obviously going to have his swarm of followers send him frags - with most guilds you will have assistance, but he will have exponentially more help than the normal guild and it will fast track him to scarab lord.
---
Yes but seems weird that they would change it to restrict higher level than allow higher level again.
---
Were you a druid by chance?
---
I'm pretty sure the limiting factor on most servers for the AQ event will be the server wide turn ins. If you're in a guild that's at least clearing BWL, you should be able to do all the quests before the gong is ready to be rang. Having a streamer on the server really shouldn't change much as far as Scarab Lord goes.
---
&gt;New players have a ball in BFA.
---
This doesn’t seem to be true at all. If it was attracting new players it’s population wouldn’t be shrinking.
---
Do you mean the beta? These are from vanilla.
---
To be a main tank. It requires the most by a large margin than any other role. You need all your different resistance sets, you have to have potions / elixirs / flasks / other buffs IDK because I don't main tank. Compared to a mage where you just... get damage... and flask, and... maybe mana pot.
---
in original vanilla, warriors were relatively rare because they were the biggest pain in the ass to level. they were also pretty much the only tanking class and the class where if you had a pocket healer or two you could steamroll battlegrounds. i'm not sure if this will change after people have seen how good they can be on pservers and are willing to put up with the longer/tougher leveling grind.
---
Both are in demand for group content.  Lock is king of leveling and gold farming IIRC thanks to their pets.
---
Fuck I almost threw up when I saw that shit
---
I can see what you mean, given that it's when we started to see the effects of super optimized rotations that the classes were sorta designed into, rather than something you had to figure out yourself - and you're honestly kidding yourself if you say classes didn't have rotations in vanilla, too - my point with why WoTLK class design was so great, was that they were designed in a way that made every class viable, while still having a wide skillset, which is something we hadn't had before, and haven't had since.
---
Orc Axe Specialization is decent too. There's plenty of Axes you can tank with. Ofcourse, since Thunderfury is a sword the racial will stop being a factor lategame.
---
There isn't really a vanilla philosphy for how an expansion should be launched. I bet if you asked the devs back before vanilla launched how they would handle an expansion, the answer would be very different from what TBC is.
---
That’s such a cool idea. Thanks, I’m gonna go watch that now.
---
I'm more excited about not having to play with Americans.
---
I mean...there will be an “Asmongold” on every server, so that won’t likely be reliable, still better than nothing. I think word of mouth will make their servers impossible to hide, though.
---
&gt; How exactly is he loud and obnoxious
---
[Kinda like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naZxqOIbyps)
---
“Talks like a chud”
---
Chapocels just can’t resist.
---
Yeah the best hunters will micro their pet in and out, sometimes every few seconds during some bosses/phases, kind of like treating it as your second, melee body that you have to avoid stuff with. 
---
One thing that concerns me about the current beta though is how delayed pet actions can be. It can take upwards of 3 seconds for a pet to react to your command sometimes, which will make pet microing a nightmare against cleaves and whatnot. Hopefully that gets fixed before raiding or it could feel really sloggy, especially because they won’t have the AOE dmg reduction that retail server pets get
---
Very informative stream, the VoD is cool. The guy himself has a super checkered past 'tho. Not that any of that seems to bleed through in this-- just as long as he doesn't start talking about busses.
---
i literally stated the possible loss of "tens of thousands of dollars" so i never made it seem so simple. it was tongue in cheek of "price you have to pay"...
---
Well if they are retail players it would be. Then again it may be normal and pservers are off. I don’t recall it from my time as a hunter at the end of vanilla through tbc into wotlk. Then again that’s years and years ago.
---
Yeah I couldn’t imagine playing the victim if you translated stream sniping to any orher walk of life.
---
Was it unethical stream sniping when the allies broke the Nazis and Japanese codes?
---
This is WARcraft. Intelligence gathering is part of war.
---
If Apple just announced every hair brain idea they had and gave away technical details of their product development to the public...aren’t you a bit retarded as their competitor to not take a look and use the information to your advantage as much as possible?
---
Streaming puts you at a disadvantage...you’re divulging your location in real time to everyone—the enemy included. Put on a delay, get used to it, or stop streaming and get a real job. 
---
You’ve gotta be ducking nuts to think I’m (or someone else) not going to check your stream. 
---
Whichever streamer is on my server opposite faction? His stream will come up anytime I’ve got an itch for wpvp.
---
Beyond all of that, streamers dying to wpvp or simply engaging in it is good content. Also to be stream sniped means you’re popular enough to be stream sniped (that’s a good thing when your career metrics are donations and subscribers).
---
And Trolls cant? lol
---
I wouldn't worry about streamers, they won't level up, people will stream snipe and camp them when servers go public.
---
I doubt any of them will make it to 60 let alone 40s, I expect 1% of streamers getting there rest will quit.
---
Same! I was on my friends account and I played as a level 39 twink until I xfered it to my own account
---
There can be both 60 and sub-60 content on a new continent, just like how there is on Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdoms.
---
In general I don't necessarily disagree with you, but in this hypothetical I'd straight dunk on all those little shits and laugh in their faces as I do it. I don't what your deal is.
---
in OG Vanilla?  no
---
For your example, could you use Strength to "cap" Crit chance somehow, be it a hard cap ((BS numbers) 500 Strength has a max Crit chance of 5% and 1000 Strength has a max Crit chance of 10%, etc.) or a soft cap that has DR on Crit chance if your Strength isn't up to snuff?
---
I realize that this problem extends into other stats and builds as well, but would solutions like this be a bad idea?
---
to the top !
---
Well... i did

Question: What's the difference between a leper gnome and a regular gnome?
---
Player: I don't know what?
---
Answer: Neither does anyone else....
---
For someone who has raided rogue since vanilla, how difference is the play style for a dps warrior?
---
Considering making the jump.
---
Thanks for agreeing that it is rose-tinted glasses.
---
so you're saying fortnite gave rise to classic?
---
This is part of the PC master race.
---
They are not the fault of capitalism. Incomplete or straight up idiotic projects happen with socialism or communism as well (and where wow would most likely never have seen the light of day). 
---
You could say they are manipulating the free market (or the consumers), which isn't exactly the same as capitalism. It's a double edged sword, though in the end we benefit from it... at least when it comes to the goods and services we have available. Corruption and greed is what we should fight, not capitalism. 
---
Also wanna say, I'm not in favor for exploitation of the work force and I believe companies should treat products, trademarks, copyrights, markets, and consumers with respect and not only as a way to gain an edge.
---
He can be self-aware till the cows come home, I never said that. Quite the opposite, it's obvious how in control of himself he is. That's what makes his personality so repulsive. I think we are in agreement after all, idk.

---
On the other end of the spectrum, many people feel you shouldn't be "good" at pvp because you can kill dragons. Makes it so skill means less than time and stats.
---
Sure it would. It is attracting new players. The problem is is that World of Warcraft has been sucking at the overall game player base for 15 years now. There are far fewer people who have never played World of Warcraft available to start playing World of Warcraft, and potential new players who are younger can be turned off when they hear that a game is older than they are.
---
There is no formula for keeping World of Warcraft massively popular and profitable expansion after expansion until the end of time. It's not possible. Player numbers were always going to dwindle.
---
Going back to Classic, going back to the start, is a way to give that player base a shot in the arm. It will not be as big as it was the first time but it will still return to fairly strong numbers. And each time they start over in classic again, they will experience a boost, but it will be smaller and smaller. Just like successive expansions. After the peak, in general, smaller and smaller, unavoidable. There was no guide to how to make this kind of a game, blizzard wrote and is still writing that book.
---
Give me the toes, daddy!
---
&gt;I forgot auto attacks were so powerful it’s not like warriors have literally ability after ability that generates threat. How was Pandaria as an introduction to wow for you?
---
Were you dropped on your head as a baby or something? Heroic Strike replace your Auto. Having more attackspeed means more threat and Taurens cannot get this attackspeed. 
---
Threat is the single biggest thing holding your raid back. Not the tank dying.
---
People here really struggle to understand what harassment is. It okay to camp or gank people for a game-play advantage or to try and interrupt them from getting an item that would make them stronger or you weaker. It's fun to coordinate in world-chat or guild-chat and figure out where they are going. It's exciting to win that battle.  
---
It's harassment and not fun to stalk a streamer non-stop with your only goal to ruin his experience and get a reaction out of him. You know where he is 100% of the time and there is no interaction at all. There's no benefit for a higher level player to tag his mobs first. There's no excitement from watching a maxed player one shot a streamer trying to level. Their only goal is to harass someone to try and get a reaction on stream and to spam emotes on them.  
---
It's mind-blowing people can't see the difference, but understanding social interactions were never a strong-part of those that play a lot of mmo's usually.
---
Class balance is definitely the thing that's going to keep me from fully enjoying Classic. I have a number of friends that want to play, but they want to play things like a tankadin or moonkin (because they look cool and fun). Once they find out the reality that they're entirely garbage in raids and no one will take them they're probably going to stop playing.
---
At least during vanilla class balance changes were constantly made, so people stuck around hoping their favorite playstyle would become viable in the future. But if no changes are being made in Classic (or even no changes for 2 years+) people will lose that hope and just quit playing.
---
Why you and others here seem to think streamers should be immune to criticism? Like what?
---
I'm a TBC baby and I remember it being level 10 too 🤔
---
i know it exists but at the time it hadn't spawned and they were bullshitting me xD
---
Dont forget zxc rebinds. 
---
I also usually have ~ for my mount.
---
If noone wanted them noone would be posting that they wanted them.
---
And as I said just having dual specs is a very fair middle ground, no actual balance changes but something that makes the sting of class balance problems a little less.
---
I watched the entirety of this thing back in the day it was awesome. Although it confused the fuck out of me cause I thought it was official lore and since I started during TBC had no idea who arthas was. Then Wrath came out and I was like "who the hell is this prince boi"
---
Yeah, I didn't get banned for jumping on top of Orgrimmar, either. But I could see why they would ban me for getting to some hidden spot with the enemy flag in Warsong..
---
Maybe they could fix exploits like the ones in Warsong Gulch but leave the other ones.
---
I am saying that what it meant to play a class was MORE than just rotation and role in combat. I am well aware that there were rotations in vanilla.
---
 It would have been cool to see more things added thay were more than just combat abilities.
---
Apple and orange
---
Eh, I probably won't play on French servers, though I did back in Vanilla. I saw the community when I resubbed in the recent expacs for IRL friends and it's absolute cancer. The channels are spammed in broken Frenglish, it's puke-inducing. I'd rather play on a UK server. I did in BC/Wrath and it was a good experience, as the demographic is international and older.
---
Two different games. Waste of time to compare them...
---
I genuinely can't tell if this response is serious or not. I'm going to walk away slowly and not get jebaited
---
I remember this working in TBC too. I used to do it all the time on my Holy Paladin. Sadly it has never worked on private servers.
---
I think so too. He really isn't that much of an asshole, his persona is definitely amping up his innate asshole behavior, though. I understand why people hate his persona, I was just trying to explain him and his persona are noticeably different.
---
&gt; Edit: I'm asking you again, how does resilience break immersion ?
---
From the top post: 
---
&gt;My first complaint is that Resilience makes no sense narratively. It's bad for immersion, because it reveals the artificial nature of the game world, acknowledging that players and NPCs are substantially different. Why does this armour protect you a lot from one guy's frostbolt, but not that other guy's? There's no in-setting reason.
---
I feel I have a good sense of what the design team's thought process was: they probably considered PvP-specific defenses could come in specific forms. Physical resistance, magic resistance, ranged resistance. Then they would have realized that, if players were able to buff their innate stats, the PvE meta changes drastically. So they would have had to take the immersion-breaking but necessary-for-arenas step of just making up an entirely new stat that arbitrarily affects the damage input from other players but not from NPCs. This over and arbitrary concession to design requirements is where the immersion problem comes in.
---
The vast majority of pservers had most bosses with more than 3700 armor.
---
Leatherworking is good for "fueling" enchanting as well.
---
Alternatives are of course druid and rogues for stealth, or hunters feign death running through instances and soloing bosses.
---
Why do you think you need to be a tailor to roll enchanting?
---
Title says classic. This is the classic wow subreddit. Not vanilla.
---
i know paladin healers spends raids buffing blessings. Not willing to do that
---
If this garners the mods attention, that's pathetic and I'll want to be banned. Sad...
---
Nah it sounds like a good time. Idgaf about streamers, I don't watch people play games. As long as its not hacking, I don't think there should be any rules outside of game mechanics. You don't like it? Don't try and monetize it and broadcast it. Get E-Famous, deal with with weirdos. Same as in real life, but much easier.
---
I know I was taking a jab at retails current nonsense where you craft gear not to wear but to just store in your bank so that you have a high enough artifical level to do LFR.
---
As far as Tier goes that only applies to some classes,  I know most warriors who DPS Tier 1 and 2 for the most part were kinda useless and they for the most part wore the non tier pieces from raids.
---
I don't disagree - if they had flattened the stat curve above level 60, it would let raid-geared 60's feel more powerful in the journey to 70, and still give the fresh 58's in quest greens an opportunity to progress through Outlands quests. But you can't let the raid-geared people stay that way forever, or there would be little incentive to do TBC raids (except the competitive aspect.) As it was, people in T3 were keeping it to raid Karazhan. Personally, I was using 2 pieces of ZG gear until 65 or 66, because the set bonus kept it viable - by themselves, they would have been replaced sooner.
---
??? If people think that being half the level cap is the full game they deserve to be fooled. They are beta testing. Not trying to entertain streamers viewers.
---
Druids are viable, don't listen to anyone who says they aren't. The only exception being boomkin.
---
As feral you are a decent tank in 5 mans and a good off tank in a raid setting. Feral dps isn't top tier obviously, but can still be decent enough to earn a raid spot in a guild that isn't run by elitist min/maxers.
---
No you can definitely do OT cause raids need 3-4 you can do all of the dungeons once MC becomes on farm you can probably get into that it won't be until I would guess early next year around Feb or April once ZG and AQ-20 come out those are fairly easy too.
---
One of my faves was in tbc.

They call me [The decapitator], [Kang the Decapitator].

+1 for Sequisha!
---
You can't name yourself after a celebrity either. ToS.
---
I've really enjoyed Kala from CLOUD 9. Dude is complete chill and genuinely loves playing Classic. He is playing a SPriest. Lately he only has about 300 viewers at peak times but his stream is a total slow burn but once it catches its on it will go nuts.
---
Just..... stop.....
---
Tank has Windfury at least so that makes up for some of the difference.
---
It's very simple to make retail addons work for classic.
---
it wont be classic if they get there own servers
---
Just because they are different factions does not mean they have to always be at war. Could still have a few of the factions with a loose enough alliance to level together in some zones. Could have done no pvp and leave the factions tuff to PVE/Story and had the PVP battlegrounds/FFA areas.
---
gotcha :) thanks!
---
What’s bannable about cornering the devilsaur leather market?
---
Beyond that what bannable about colluding with the opposite faction.
---
It’s an mmo, you boys need to learn how to deal and socialize. Not every interaction is idyllic. Some are downrig toxic. 
---
But as Butters from South Park says, you can’t have happy times without sad ones, for sad times remind you why the happy times are so great. 
---
A real community has paragons and shit stains, heroes and villains. Don’t like that they get all the tags? Establish your own cross faction network to compete.
---
More of a YouTuber but he has been streaming classic beta.
---
Maybe in the US it's left leaning, as the US is very far on the right relative to the rest of the world.
---
To the rest of the world, it is a very right wing publication.
---
I wouldn't say streaming puts you at a disadvantage. I would say it just makes you a general. You are a prio target. The enemy will want to kill you. Which is why if your streaming. Warrior is prolly not the best pick. It's pretty rough to not die on a warrior. At the very least with how many fan boys he has. He needs at least two priest and Two mages to form a Praetorian Guard of sorts.  Priests for heals and dispels and Mages for the heavy CC and control.
---
Thats his issue. He doesn't understand this isn't retail. The factions will grow in hatred for each other and, High value targets will be hunted into the dirt. You can't expect to make yourself a general and, not have enemy grunts try to kill you.
---
Unless you played on the superior pserver that actually set these values correctly :)
---
No rules? So you are okay with death threats, racial slurs, sexual harassment?  
---
Just because someone monetizes their passion doesn’t mean they deserve to be subject to what I said above and more. The internet isn’t a free pass to be a horrible human being.
---
"Sad!"
---
This hits way too close to home.
---
og\_jeffery, he's not as well known since he's been on private servers, but he's on beta now.
---
Lol took me 2 tries with my hunter lvl 10 back in vanilla.
---
But i admire your willpower and you got some good taste.
---
If you are okay tanking/offtanking PvE, something like this 31/5/15 spec will allow you to get most of the PvP goodies out of Arms while still being a sufficient tank for level 60 dungeons and a capable off-tank for raids:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/BTzNz0DQATAD_BRA
---
As someone with similarly low ambitions as yourself, this is what I plan on doing.
---
Because tailoring was the only profession to produce disenchantables without needing a gathering profession.
---
I’m not sure how I’ll get leather for learherworking without skinning.
---
Thankfully, ZG is only a 20-man, so you're getting 4 enchants per week. That's still 5 months of weekly clears, so guilds will have to limit it to Main-spec only players with their pre-AQ best-in-slot Head and Legs already looted.
---
Shouldn't be a problem for several classes since they'll have been farming MC and Ony for the better part of a year, but for some classes, the BIS head is off Nefarian and the BIS legs also come from BWL.
---
Hunters, Priests, Rogues, Shaman, and your MT will have the easiest time of it.
---
Behind the glory that is Chuck Norris' beard, there is no chin.  There is only another fist.
---
It makes it easier for people to float between the two. It will screw with the population on the servers are leaving from. 
---
People that want everything made easy for them, should stick to retail. 
---
If you want bc that bad, start all over.
---
I just want a pvp server that still has small rules like the naming convention rules in place. For some reason it always rustles my jimmies when I see stupid names in game. It's a stupid thing to get rustled about but meh.
---
I've personally played dwarf and nelf hunter.
---
The + to guns doesn't really mean much a few less misses but guns are rarely BiS for any particular bracket.
---
The stoneform is "ok",  more useful for a non-beast hunter. 
---
However the ability to escape or rezz then meld eat and drink is super powerful  espcially in  griefing situations.
---
In the world,  when grinding mobs I'm always standing on a trap, and I'm always Flaring.
---
So I gave a ton or rogues a very bad day.  Against crappy rogues they usually had enough after a death or two.
---
Against a particularly excellent rogue, I've had an encounter where we went back and forth killing each other for over 8 hours solid.
---
We both learned a ton from each other, and became better players.  Without the meld, I would have been dead again before I could recover, and neither of us would have learned much.
---
nope not a loyal viewer at all. I’ve actually stopped watching him all that often due to how bad his chat can be. it’s not something I really wanna be apart of. buuuut with that said I really do believe he’ll tell people not to send him stuff. sure some people will still do it because they want their 15 mins of fame but that doesn’t mean he’s going to accept it. I don’t know why everyone chooses to look at him so negatively.
---
I recalled the limit being 8. Didn't realize that classic was using the 16 limit.
---
People people are so desperate to "prove" private servers have been wrong that they dont consider the implication of any differences before jumping to conclusions.
---
Yes it's really annoying. 9% additional parry wont make a huge difference. Since we also know armor is much higher on private servers the threat generation in Classic is unlikely to take a huge hit compared to privates.
---
&gt; If 20 people are able to pull the weight of 40, then that's 20 spots that can go to anybody who's willing to show up with a good attitude.
---
That doesn't really work out very well though due to guild drama. Unless your raid group is somehow super amazing (which isn't likely in a casual guild with 20 dead weights), you're eventually going to hit a wall somewhere (e.g. Razorgore, Vael). When you get stuck those top 20 people are going to start getting super salty about carrying the bottom 20. Either the GM/RL will cave and force those people to respec (or just not invite them), or those 20 top people will start looking for a new guild.
---
it did help, 9% more parry news will only increase the gap im afraid.
---
The only classes where race matters (in PVE) are:  
---
Dwarf Priest &gt; all  
---
Human/Orc Warrior &gt; all  
---
Human Rogue has a small advantage
---
For PvP it's much more utility based, choose the class that has the benefits against the classes you want to fight.
---
Of course a stress test is gonna have a lot of people in 1 area lol
---
Tbh the game is pretty much perfect. The best RPG I’ve played. And I mostly play RPG’s
---
I'm on the server that rhymes with "horsetail". It has way higher armor values than the datamined Classic values.
---
Yep it changed before 1.12 so we get the good life lol
---
Both are really good.  For 5 mans, I would say Mages have a slight advantage because sheeping was easier than succubus charming.  But they are about equal.  If you had a good warlock, then you wouldn't miss the mage.  But hey, if you had a good hunter, you wouldn't miss either as well.
---
For raids: warlocks hands down.  Soul stone was invaluable, banishing was necessary, dps was tops - only a fury warrior should beat you really, plus you had imp buff, and there were at least two times where a warlock was needed to shadow tank.  There were a few encounters were fear locking a target was necessary too.  Warlocks were insanely versible.
---
Mages in a raid - dps and vendor drinks.  Very few sheepable targets in raids.
---
PvP - I'd say about equal.  Both had their strengths of weaknesses.  Locks were less squishy due to soul link and felhound could be a nuisances for a healer.  Fear spamming was annoying and burst, dps was good too.  But mages had more burst, mobility, and still had their cc.  I'd say they were about equal overall, but they were good and bad at different things.
---
Retail's big problem is that the MMO genre (I can't bring myself to use the term MMORPG) is very crowded right now. There's a bunch of other quality games that offer basically the same experience. Players are enjoying Retail WoW, but the game simply doesn't offer any thing different and it requires a monthly sub.
---
Yeah it's a pretty solid show. Takes a few episodes for everyone to really sink into the characters and get comfortable on camera but by episode 4 the show has a solid pacing. Really enjoying it a lot now. The current arc is awesome
---
Spriest isn’t a meme spec. Lmao as long as the debuff limits are available having one shadow priest is actually really good because of the “shadow weaving” debuff they apply to buff warlocks.
---
It should be an alternative universe like they did with star trek. The players coming back in time have changed events to a brand new time line!
---
Lmao are you trying to win sympathy by shitting on every MMO player as someone who doesn't understand social interactions? Dude sounds like you have no idea what you are talking about.
---
This is a bug from hardware cursor. Can confirm it has happened since vanilla. On older clients you can turn HW cursor off.
---
A good test is to move your mouse in a straight line horizontally and spam right click to turn your camera, you'll notice that jump quickly.
---
40-50 is the nadir of motivation.
---
Couldn't have said it better
---
What's not to love about anal and 4th graders?
---
&gt;because they chose a french server specifically to get away from speaking english
---
Not really. French servers have been there since Day 1 of the EU launch (along English and German). It's the default, normal choice for French speakers. It's like saying you chose an English server specifically to get away from the French and Germans. It's nonsense. People don't make decisions based on their relation to England.
---
I'm planning on doing Herbalism/Alchemy for a while, possibly the entire first phase or longer, but eventually dropping one of the two for Engineering in time for phase 3 at the latest.
---
this is among the dumbest posts I've ever seen. bravo
---
That’s actually not all they do. Just the common believe from the ill informed.
---
Survive the grind to 40 only to realize that level 50 is halfway to 60. Retail players are in for a shock.
---
I live in California and sometimes I'll drive through these brown hilly areas and they remind me of the barrens.
---
Lionheart helmet as well.... BIS.... forever.....
---
you have to go to another zone if you dont want to grind. westfall/loch/redridge is what gets you 10-20 if you dont wanna go to darkshore which has superior quest density.  even joana's alliance guide has you going to loch modan and darkshore.
---
And make sure you iill mobs whenever you can if it’s efficient. If you only do quests, and don’t have much rested xp, you may find it difficult and necessary to grind a few levels.
---
That's their only real application. After that they're a wasted do slot due to how inefficient they are.
---
I'm in a very different place in my life than I was back then, but I often think back to my WoW friends and wonder how they're doing. I sure hope they resurface with Classic, if only to say hi :)
---
Yea we funneled out resources into 1 player. I doubt a 200 man guild will have the same impact as a streamer with thousands of fans.
---
should I report streamers when they organise their 100 v 100 battles in SS and Arathi ? its hurting my gaming experience.... and nowwwwwwwwwwwww we are at retail.
---
I'd love to  play with Taliesin if it weren't for the timezone issue!
---
Yeah and most of their conditions were shit and nothing in line with OSRS. OSRS requires a total skill of 300 and 25 hours /played. 
---
The guy I replied to suggested 100 days /played, clearing BWL, and high ranked PvPers only. Do those requirements sound similar at all? They sure don't to me. Listening to PvPers is what led to the GCD-locked gameplay of BfA, due to CD macro bloat.
---
Oh hey, look at this brand new opinion someone has about streamers. What a great submission!
---
A warlock "hard counters" mages because of pet counterspell. Not only does this depend on having a specific pet out, a good mage could bait it and get his fire spells silenced and be free to blink around and nova and pew pew for 24 seconds. IF a mage fails to avoid getting frost spells silenced, they still have blink to get away while Locks have zero mobility native to their class. Not to mention iceblock cleanses all de-buffs. I am not saying a lock can't hold his own against a frost mage. I am saying frost mages never really had a "hard counter" 
---
I also played Druid and in TBC a feral druid was really the closest thing to a hard counter. Having two charges, and the ability to break novas with shape shift allows feral druids to stick to mages and apply damage. 
---
The problem in Vanilla is that, unless we are talking exclusively endgame geared pvp, druids don't have the mana pool to sustain that many shape shifts. On top of this, they only have bear form charge which isn't enough to stay on the mage. 
---
Also, everything i say is in regards to pvp in general. Including pvp leveling in contested zones. Locks are great, but they just aren't as good as mages in the majority of situations.
---
yeah and i completely missed the first two hours they were watching (aka the entire fucking point) hense my woah woah wtf. They need to send emails to participants regarding schedules so WE can schedule appropriately
---
Hardcore.
---
Being more social doesnt mean it's not casual. Current wow content is way harder than classic. There's more mechanics and classes press more buttons and have combos tow work into.  Classic is very casual in the sense of gameplay.
---
Also everything you said applies to mythics and mythic raiding and even heroic raiding today. You still need to look for a group or guild and coordinate even more today to pass mechanics. Lfd/lfr is a wash, dont go off of that.
---
I'd like to add Kargoz (streams on YouTube). Very chill and smart guy
---
You missed my whole point. If you have a product that’s good at attracting new player and keeping them because “new players have a ball” then your customer base would grow. 
---
Also this idea that nearly everyone has played wow is batshit, gaming is 100x bigger than it was 10 years ago. The amount of people that have played wow isn’t even a drop in the bucket of potential players.
---
No server crash? This isn't Classic, this is a SHAM!
---
Actually I think you're right. There were streamers on a very stable layer which is the one in that video. But yeah I suspect there were plenty of unlucky ones too. I assumed all alliance layers were more stable.
---
But you can see in that video it's a collapsed layer because no way we saw that many players at any point.
---
At any rate, it's a stress test and you shouldn't expect any more. I do hope they discover the cause and fix it though.
---
Imagine thinking that blizzard monitors the stress test through Twitch streams. *Imagine* it bro.
---
Took me 3 months alone from 40 to 60, sadly i can't see the data before 40.
---
This is coming from the guy that thinks it’s funny to camp streamers to get a reaction, then back pedals when people point out that its harassment.  
---
I’m not trying to win anything here. You simply don’t understand what harassment is, and I am pointing out that a lot of people have gotten used to their anonymity online and have gotten used to getting away with being horrible people. Also, if you think that the average “gamer” isn’t as introverted or struggles more socially than the average “non-gamer” then you are living in an imaginary world.
---
Ohh ok so you actually have to clear a fairly tough dungeon to get to the  crafting area for flasks. Damn. News to me! Ok thanks, and that means you can't craft flasks until youre geared and max level? Are vanilla flasks equivalent to the flasks in BFA in terms of effectiveness for progression/pvp? Better or worse?
---
careful, they're start charging extra fees for it
---
I remember i had an int set on nost to grind out 305 before our next raid. It took hours! but i was grinding jujus at the same time so it worked out.
---
But it looks pretty damn awesome!
---
It’s not different than having a nightfall wielder. Anything is a “wasted slot” if you take away one aspect of a class. By that logic mages are a wasted slot if you take away their damage because rogues do better. Sometimes all that’s needed is one important role in a raid of 40 people to be useful
---
Do yourself a favour and don't go with enchanting unless you're the designated guild enchanter.
---
No I'm just saying the narrative of it being the best expansion is overhyped and mostly by people who never even raiding past Karazhan.
---
Especially with the last few levels!
---
I know i like your idea i was talking about follow the spiders and becoming undead. 
---
There where some questions about your idea 
---
Anyways i hope for some new xpac after 2-3 years of classic a new one or even bc
---
Your resource bar works in reverse. Where the rogue is all about timing your abilities to ensure you have sufficient energy to maintain your dps, the warrior is about ramping up and dumping rage. You will generate more threat as a warrior inherently since they are a tanking class and don't have a native threat reduction to their base damage. Your gearing will be similar but focused on strength/attack power +hit/crit rather than agility, although agility gets you more mileage per point towards crit.  
---
Playstyle wise, dual wield fury feels similar to combat rogue. You'll be using bloodthirst, whirlwind, and heroic strike as your primary dps abilities, with the added benefit of being able to use death wish every 2 minutes to increase damage dealt. You may want to consider popping recklessness and death wish at the same time to get insane bursty crits. 2H fury requires a bit more timing since you'll be weaving improved slams when your instant attacks (bloodthirst and whirlwind) are on cooldown. You won't be using heroic strike as 2hFury since it affects your rage generation (consumes a white hit while spending rage at the same time.) 
---
You can DPS as arms too, but you need a guild that's willing to give up a debuff slot for mortal strike in 40 man (and a ton of people on this sub will tell you that's anathema and nobody would ever do it and you're terrible if you want to.) Same strat as 2hFury above but replace bloodthirst with mortal strike.
---
Dungeons/raid neither xrealm?
---
Classic, or retail? I have a hard time staying with retail, because I dont have the time to join a raiding guild, and every other guild I joined was dead besides 4 or 5 people. So it felt like there were people around me, but I still felt "alone". That might happen again in classic, but I think it will feel better because you have to make those connections with people, you cant just que up for a dungeon or raid.
---
Hi, /u/ZippZappWapp, your post has been removed as it is seems to be talking about the current stress test. Please use the current [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bui555/stress_test_2_the_megathread_of_omg_why_can_i_not/) instead.
---
Glad to see that we've surpassed tribalism in current year
---
Are streamers like Asmon likely to launch on a PVP server? I feel like the stream sniping would be out of hand, but I guess if you have a clique with you at all times that's not a concern.
---
Like I said, no video game company, not even blizzard, can program a game that is outside of the bounds of chemical human brain tolerance. The more you do something, the less Joy it brings you.
---
Blizzard can bring in new players. But they can't stop old players from achieving burnout. They strive valiantly to delay it with repackaging content and new fresh this that and the other thing. Over and over again, it's simple human chemistry.
---
I could see some people complaining about how would a monster get a card, and not tear it up.
---
But they should remember that Blizzard has games where swarms of mosquitoes drop broadswords as loot.
---
Lots of people just really enjoy hating someone or something. I try not to put too much more thought into it than that. People see the character he plays and they summon all their energy into convincing themselves that the character is real.
---
Okay fine, the people who pushed for Classic and the target audience of Classic don't want it.  The people who want to try it out for something different or to be part of the hype will quit well before they hit 60, so they shouldn't be listened to
---
i remember a Grand Theft Koto on Warsong-US back in the day aswell
---
Imagine thinking they don't. I've never met a Luxo who wasn't perfectly fluent in French (and German).
---
Im not saying it is dead far from it but the current state of the market doesnt justify attempting a new mmo which risks flopping and killing your main mmo at the same time. Wow is still the leader of the market and the classic release will either fidelise some customers to keep their sub despite the state of retail or bring in new or bring back old customers.
---
The most likely course of action depending on classic success is the reimplementation of features and certain philosophies of classic into retail and a release of TBC classic server. Its the easiest and safest course of action and companies tend to go for those. (Especially with Brack at the helm who probably wants Kotick off his back a bit or to please him if he’s the puppet I suppose he is)
---
I feel like most of them will play it close to the vest unless they are trying to run their own guild like Esfand.
---
Your time limit isn’t how quickly people donate/carry them through that quest chain, but how long it takes for the server to complete the contributions to the war effort.
---
Many servers can have multiple people waiting with their scepters to hang the gong. Just depends how dedicated they are to the grinds.
---
wtf is going on in your head?
---
I would just grind out those last levels on raid night and not tell anyone 🤗
---
That a big difference between stress and beta.
---
No one cares who you are on beta. Soda, Sonii, Asmon, Preach, Quinn...they’re all just 1 player. A potential 20% of my dungeon group. (What’s been really surreal is seeing people who I raided with in bc, wrath, cata, mop on the beta...playing the same name they had then. Notice the name in chat and strike up a convo like we had last spoke last night during DS or TOGC farm) 
---
The beta is full of 15 year veterans, blizzard associated people and the like. There just isn’t a massive celebrity culture for them.
---
I am pretty well convinced things will be much more like the stress server than the beta server when live comes in regards to streamer fandom.
---
Why shouldn't people be able to float between the two? Isn't that better than people leaving classic altogether? What makes you think that the population would be "screwed", what does that even mean? I don't see any issue with the population dropping provided they continue merging servers. Instead of making cross server play like they did for retail they should have developed megaservers in the first place. You'll never be able to tell the population dropped by 50% if they merge the servers appropriately. 
---
I want to level a character to 60, raid, and then have a simulated BC release where I can take my character and its history and gear into BC, like we did all those years ago. It's not like there wouldn't be a flood of people rerolling or leveling as Draenei/Blood Elves anyway. There was a huge population of people who rerolled when BC came out.
---
if you ever had one

See my other response

9s rules made no fucking since 8s was and is the tits.

Horde from '05 to '11. Went alliance in '12 and have alternated between playing both factions since and each time I went horde I did it against my better judgement.

Look Jane we need to talk.
---
There's something else, now I've discussed it with WoW, and WoW says you welcome to join us in our night time activities.   or you can sit alone on the couch waiting for me and WoW to be done, then I'll come to bed with you later.
---
Either way, me and WoW intend to spend the foreseeable future together, so either you can join me in this new relationship, or you can shut the hell up and get out.
---
Love John
---
It’s kind of crazy to explain to someone that has never played an MMORPG that you keep in touch with people you’ve never met. 
---
The looks I get from my girlfriend when I explain the guy texting me I met through video games...
---
Why would it? Tanks are surviving just fine without a shield on private servers, and we already know a lot of bosses hit much much harder there.
---
Example: 10k Armor Warrior in 2006 vs 15.000 armor Druid against the same enemy on a private server. No debuffs/buffs that change the damage taken. Even when you factor in the blocked damage and Defensive stance the 2006 damage is way below the private server value.
---

---
For me the grind really starts at around 23 or so to 40. Once you get out of your first 2 zones and all of the sudden you have to start bouncing around to different zones in the 25-35 range, usually across the sea from each other, and you don't have a mount, that's the true grind. Hitting 40 is like getting your second wind.
---
Classic is for casuals, deal with it.
---
Yes, this was my experience. I'd have quit WoW back in Cata (and did for several months) but I grew very attached to a few of my characters. On top of it I was an avid RPer, and felt like I still had stories to tell, so to speak, so while the gameplay itself ceased to matter all that much to me, I had community ties (RP servers still have those!) and a lot of investment in my characters that I was very reluctant to leave behind permanently. For a long time. The game finally hit that breaking point for me in WoD where I just couldn't do it anymore.
---
&gt; And I admit that the realism argument is probably the weakest or least important.
---
Disagreed. It is very important since it is deeply felt by many people. Things of this nature are difficult to explain in online forum debates since it's subjective and a feeling. You can't really make someone understand a feeling unless they feel it too. But that doesn't mean it's a weak argument at all. Maintaining immersion is a big deal.
---
The good parts are greater class spec diversity, difficult dungeons (heroics), unified storyline, gear that made sense, actual raid progression (needed to clear T4 to move on to T5, etc.)
---
The negative aspects include flying mounts, and towards the end of the expansion - dailies and catch-up mechanics. 
---
I’ll be happy if they release TBC as it was, but would be in heavy if they could release it in the Classic spirit.  Essentially just figuring out a way to remove the negative aspects I listed.
---
You don’t want deep wounds. 2h spec, improved execute, and on some fights improved cleave is good. There’s lots of different builds you can choose to do.
---
ShadowPanther...now there's a name I haven't seen in a really long time
---
STOP. POSTING. HERE
---
This is not a fucking advertising subreddit for your youtube videos.
---
Could you elaborate on the "more" than just a rotation thing, then? Do you mean more niche abilities like Distracting Shot, or more very-niche-but-mad-flavourful stuff like Eyes of the Beast? :)
---
I watched a good hour of his stream and kind of dozed off cause I was tired, and I honestly just really liked that lol.  No constantly saying "THANKS FOR TWITCH PRIME" every 5 secs, no crazy sound effects.  Just only playing game music answering some chill questions.
---
cant let another warrior take my top spot. Especially not after my guild just invested an upgrade in me!
---
&gt; When chuck Norris raids ~~as a Moonkin, he is not viable,~~ he is optimal.
---
fixed
---
ACCCCSHUUALLLY, 44 is halfway.
---
You also don't want too much horizontal, otherwise you end up with a game like gw2... while fun, it gets boring very fast since nothing you do really matters because you're not progressing at all.
---
Yeah, No way I'm not playing a dwarf pally in Classic. Dopest mount in the game, and its cheaper then all yall weak ass vender mounts, with the added bonus of an amazing questline
---
If noone who wants classic wanted it noone who wants classic would be asking for it.
---
Most people are going to get over the #nochange propaganda once they start playing and the nostalgia goggles come off.
---
Yep I remembered 1-35 was mostly seamless and then I started to feel the grind. But this is ok! I enjoyed it as it allowed me to see more of the world.
---
It's still really fun in vanilla, and you should be able to adapt to the gaps in abilities that you were used to. Warriors still have great mobility, and the pvp trinket will remove snaring/stun effects. The biggest issue with warriors in vanilla is that there a lot of really bad ones and it's a class that appeals to a lot of people due to the class fantasy of swinging a 2 hander in plate. You need to shine in your ability to tank or do good damage or kill people in pvp. Make friends because you'll need pocket healers a lot more in vanilla than in other expansions.
---
I hear ya. I deal with timezone differences for work every day (on the east coast and work with a lot of danes and poles). Definitely don't want to deal with that for playing a game, haha.
---
Another good point; before achievements you didn't really know if you had "finished" a zone, and it wasn't really the point. No boards to tell you where to go. You'd kinda understand when you'd finished a quest hub and you'd just follow the quests into a new zone.
---
Never said it was perfect - just better than vanilla.
---
It also take a non-zero amount of effort to target and cast it. If it gives basically no benefit, some people may rather not bother.
---
Being able to wreck them with mediocre skills the most fun part of playing basketball against 5 year olds.
---
not back peddling at all. 
---
It is a GAME that pits 2 factions against eachother. If a streamer will likely be the leader of the opposite faction due to following, guild size, and rank/items ETC. by nature people will want to defeat him/her.  
---
Litereally the story of every comic/ anime/ game i've played watched in awhile.
---
If you hate that aspect of the game play PVE no one will trash you for that. But wanting to play on PVP and receive a ton of advantages due to following without any of the backlash is ridiculous. I have the same attitude towards celebrities who make millions from the public eye but hate attention.
---
I do not think the average gaming is as introverted or struggles more than anyone. Everyone has their own challenges and insecurities and our hobbies do not make us more inclined to fit a social stereotype. Come on man Gamers have never been cooler and yet you still act like we are all anti social jerks. Generalizing everyone in 1 group of social indept people who are bullies is incredibly ignorant.
---
&gt; Shadowmeld can have some practical use in WPvP for ambushes and safer eating as well.
---
Yeah I feel like people really sleep on Shadowmeld because it isn't a “combat” racial. You won't win any duels with Shadowmeld but it's super useful in BGs and World PvP.
---
I've been having the same issue in being split between sticking with what I've mained since the very beginning in vanilla or trying something that will be much friendlier to my now adult life and the time constraints that come along with it. This is just my thought process so take from it what you will. 
---
Warrior was the only class I played in vanilla (let alone even got to 60) and I had an absolute blast once I got a hang of the quirks. Like everyone else says, you live and die by the gear you've got. I remember when I upgraded my Ice Barbed Spear to an Obsidian Edged Blade it felt like I was playing a different game. Nothing is ever going to feel quite as good as two-shotting someone with an MS execute combo. My fear is that I just wont have the time it takes to level and properly gear one up, especially as a dps warrior since I'm sure that is going to be the most saturated class by far. Knowing I won't be able to no-life my way to 60 and spam dungeons / raids all day everyday I'm pretty sure I'm going hunter this time around. The ability to solo a lot of PvE stuff and not have to compete as much for gear is appealing to me with such limited playtime. On the other hand, if you've got a priest to level with and PvP with, warrior might be more viable for you as that would basically solve every problem they have pre-60 and makes you much scarier in BGs. Vanilla warrior is definitely tough to manage, but there's a reason people say that it was the golden age for warriors. If you put the time and energy into getting geared up, you'll be a monster in PvE and PvP.
---
Commenting to see link if he replies
---
I always felt like the late 30's to mid 40's were the worst. After that it gets easier. Last 2-3 levels are an absolute blast.
---
If you properly budgeted for it! Otherwise you're still walking till you're 50+
---
What are you talking about, just ban the fuckers who cares.
---
That's very possible as most people didn't even bother with naxx, due to tbc coming a couple of months later.
---
It's totally plausible that only 1% of all vanilla accounts ever set foot in naxx. The only ones who did this were hardcore raiding guilds, who has cleared everything else and had nothing else to do.
---
I think you need to interact with debris from the quest The Lost Pilot for this guy to spawn and I dont think hes ab elite 
---
I just did this quest
---
And that's a perfectly fine, healthy thing to admit. Everyone's got their own opinions about each expansion and I know the general Community consensus about world of garrisons. I personally loved garrisons. But I also admit that I could not separate my own burn out from my opinion about what things in the game I didn't like. There is always crossover between those two.
---
The complaint about transmogging really only comes about because of expansions, and being able to go back on a high level character and farm low level content. It's a valid complaint, because it's not really "earned" in a sense of more danger / higher reward. There isn't a danger on transmog runs.
---
It has made me wonder if there's a better way to do transmogging that solves both being able to go back and get old gear (because people like to do that), and retains that "earned it" value. Maybe have certain color sets only drop when the expansion first comes out? Not sure.
---
This is valid. Enchanting will be -EV for 95% of people who skill it up
---
GOtta get to the end! Rush to stand around looking for a tank for 3 hours homie!
---
Updooted for Nadir. I like that world and, it's so rarely brought out.
---
Bur
---
That's what I said... they aren't resetting swing timer on Classic Beta. That's a huge DPS increase compared to private servers.
---
having transmogs is fine i think but you need the rewards of transmogs as somthing hard to do. i have for a long time thought that gear should stop at heroic ilvl on retail and insted sick unique skins is what you get from mythic raids.
---
i remember flying around my rust and ironbound drake in ulduar days and knew i was the shit same with my undying title. that is what made me a clear bad ass.
---
i also think a neat idea with transmogs would be to limit what transmogs you can use depending on your ilvl. so if you see a warrior in full T3 running you down you know like before he is a bad ass ready to take you to pound town.
---
He was just chillin when I found him. And no he's not an elite
---
Yeah because racing to AQ is the best thing ever.
---
The last few days I have turned more into the warlock aswell. Might be my choice. 
---
Thank you mate.
---
Doesn’t this sub have some kind of rules against this
---
An extra button or two that COULD be used in a DPS rotation I don't consider a rotation, no.
---
On top of that "enjoy your 1 button rotation" has been a thing for over a decade by folks who make fun of Vanilla enthusiasts because it's a reduction of what you're pressing 90% of the time.
---
Sorry, chap. As someone who raided through Naxx since day 1 of Vanilla, the "rotation" for just about every class is boneheaded easy and doesn't have much to press repeatedly.
---
There are other buttons, sure, but the reduction is, quite literally, Shadow Bolt spam. It's a running joke in the Vanilla community for most classes to be over simplified.
---
Maybe you've only been interested in Vanilla in the past year or two and have no clue but this has been a meme since before memes and since Vanilla.
---
Cry, moat, noob.
---
P servers are satiating my need to play classic for now.
---
Hunters could tame things two levels higher than them back in the day no? 
---
I tamed Bjarn who's also a rare spawn white bear in the stress test
---
Yes, I did mention Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the windseeker. Would you like to discuss it? 🧐
---
No serious shaman will compete for the same gear as a hunter
---
OK, to be fair, it's a lot of hype right now.  I REALLY, REALLY DO hope classic is a smash hit.  it would show Blizz just how wrong they are about instant gratification and slot machine design.
---
If classic looks like this 6 months after it launches, THEN we can talk shit and make memes about that guy.
---
he will get the rep farm done so fast.
---
He's been my goto classic streamer personally.  But since he is getting more popular he sometimes devolves into typical twitch crap.  Sometimes theres alot of TTS bs, a million thanks for the twitch prime (means he's getting a lot of subs which is good, but man i'd prefer a "thank you guys" lol), but hes still just an enjoyable personality and chill dude.  And sometimes you just gotta pump it up.
---
The issue is that vertical progression was almost an inevitability for WoW given that the only real means of character progression at level 60 is obtaining better gear. Gear resets/level cap increases were pretty much necessary, because with this linear system of character progression, you end up with players being heavily fragmented across progression levels. It becomes impossible to provide enough content to keep players engaged when Timmy hasn't even reached level 49 yet, Johnny just finished his first MC run, and Rachel has full T3.
---
OSRS was much better suited for horizontal progression from the beginning because character progression wasn't as linear due to each skill leveling up independently, natural gear resets in the form of losing items/gear/gold, and much less emphasis on group content (meaning that you don't need to find people at the same progression point to progress further).
---
I'm not saying that implementing horizontal progression is impossible for Classic, but I am saying that it's not as simple as just adding new dungeons/raids/areas.
---
If you are feeling burnt out at 30-40, try to level some professions for a break. Or go gather stuff and sell it. People are going to be rushing so hard to 60 they won't stop to literally pick the flowers haha
---
Or grind SM and RFD with some guildies / friends. Great instances with some amazing loot
---
what's the name of the addons? Thanks
---
If you are commiting to armorsmithing as a prot war you are already 1000000x more useful to a guild recruiter than fury warrior/rogue #1535221. Your race is going to be super negligible to any guild that knows what they're doing. Yes, even the hardcore ones.
---
Even worse, it's not HIS videos. He's ripping content from Twitch users and compiling it into Youtube videos for his own gain. It's disgusting.
---
Stop
---
Myeh, it's gonna be hard to get enchants on raid gear and pvp gear. Would definitely prefer it the old way.
---
Yeah, as I think about it this seems more reasonable and could actually work for me :)
---
Bit of a different question - I sort of want to go warrior, but I'm worried that there'll be so many warriors that I'll struggle to find a decent guild/group. Do people think that as long as you're a decent enough player, the over-saturation of warriors wont matter?
---
If it’s going to be your first char and you are playing alone, do yourself a favour and don’t do it at the start.
---
You can make some money on the AH with Tailoring, but it you combine it with Enchanting it will be a money sink. It’s better to level two gathering professions to 60 and then swap one for Enchanting once you have some cash to spend on stuff.
---
If your goal is tanking, consider a warrior or a druid over a paladin. Pallies are mainly a support and healing class in vanilla/classic. Ret can do some good damage in pvp once you're geared properly, but you won't be main tanking any raids. You'll probably tank 5 man dungeons, maybe some stuff in UBRS 10 man at best. Skarm Tank has some good videos about why.
---
If you've never played a warrior before, you're in for a treat. I'll warn you now - low levels are going to suck. Hit level 40, get your first 6 second cooldown instant attack and it's like a whole different class. You will have to get good at stance dancing, learn how threat works, knowing when to use abilities and when to store the rage for something else... it's really fun.
---
Unending Breath is useless 90% of the time. Detect Invisibility though? Give me that shit every day of the week. I'll take every advantage over those pesky rogues.
---
This is not possible, and suggested yesterday, delete
---
These are good points. 
---
I did mean BOE , but how I mean that is if the player is farming a specific BOE to use there were be a flat 20g for carry and then 50g for the BOE (which they need to equip) since most of these that people would be seeking are BIS I think being in 70g is a great deal considering they are probably 500g on AH? 
---
Are you saying it would be better to just charge the flat rate for run and we /roll (whole group) or that those are payment for the carry? 
---
I just want to stay right with the server and make some money. Last time around I was known for great carries and it left me broke because of the kindness of my heart. This time I’d like it to be worth the time.
---
May God bless, and keep the streamers... Far away from us.
---
Literally.
---
Try to get a char from 1 to 100 in PoE. Learn how to grind like a real big boi.
---
UP!
---
Da fuq u talkin bout?
---
&gt; but i'm afraid it's going to be too time consuming and will put me behind the leveling race.  
---
You are a priest. you are behind the leveling race starting from character creation.  If you want to level fast pick a hunter, warlock, druid or mage.
---
I'm taking enchanting and tailoring on my bank/auction alt. I just mail them extra greens/blues and cloth.
---
Classic. Retail no. Never went back there after I started playing vanilla on private servers again. 
---
It won’t happen again mate. Classic is a totally different game than what retail is today. Retail ain’t even wow anymore.
---
Could you explain more about paladins then?  I dont have a lot of knowledge.
---
Yeah just read a little further down.
---
Honestly Cdew was probably still doing 3's during that, its crazy how while doing 3's he tabs out for 5 secs does some classic stuff, tabs back into arena starts spamming arena stuff then goes back to classic fighting a boar lol.  Pretty unreal lol.
---
Wait are you pro or anti classic? Classic is amazing and more people are seeing how great it is every day.
---
45-50 was always the biggest kick in the dick for me. Always felt like I was out of quests, struggling with my current gear. Always felt weak as fuck. 
---
50-60 was smooth sailing.
---
Sure, let's ignore the part where pserver devs had to guess and make due with a lack of information for many variables (armor is a recent example) and that everybody has always known they might be at least a little bit off. Nevermind that Blizz has an actual vanilla 1.12 server and client that they log into to recreate situations to verify whether something is working as intended or not. Nevermind that the classic client is using 1.12.1 data, including the data pservers never, ever, ever, ever had access to.
---
It's all ***changes reeeeeee***.
---
As far as the *actual changes*, like bnet, layering, etc, I mean wtf do you expect them to do when they clearly from the get go stated that Classic is not a 1:1 recreation, will NOT be run like a true MMO (hence "content buckets" instead of patch rollouts and everything based on 1.12), etc.
---
And don't get me started on layering. Of course it isn't ideal, but some of us have a slightly stronger distaste for opening up a massive amount of servers that have to be merged and shut down in a month while forcing character renames on migrating players because a tourist who no longer logs in is sitting on the same name.
---
This guy is 1. a troll, and 2. if we for some reason assume he isn't (he is) then it's just a blatant example of what some of us have been saying, that some people don't want authentic vanilla, they want their private server experience, which has now conclusively been proven to differe to varying degrees from original 1.12.1. Some people just want Nost without risk of court orders or dev drama shutting it down and rerolling.
---
AoE looting leads to faster instance clears, which leads to faster market flooding, which leads to a broken economy.
---
Has it been confirmed you can realm transfer from pve to pvp vice versa?
---
Or would that not be fair.. you could just level on a pve realm then switch to pvp later
---
Get any pet.
---
Have that pet tank while you tame the pet you want.
---
Whne taming is almost complete, abandon pet.
---
EZ
---
Fury is really the only option for PvE dps. The biggest damage dealing ability Arms has is Mortal Strike, and you can't even use it in raids because it takes up a debuff slot. Generally, Fury is only viable in PvE and Arms is only viable in PvP.
---
I throw judgement of light on mobs that melee are fighting on my 60 Paladin 
---
However sometimes I’ll do the opposite and laugh as the mob heals itself over and over again but I’ll holy shock it to death before any real harm is done.
---
Dont respec :)
---
Sorry I don’t really watch any streamers at all, what exactly is wrong with being on a server with streamers? I did see someone brought a dragon to SW which I thought was pretty hilarious. Is there anything annoying they do or is it bc of their following/annoying fans?
---
I feel like this is supposed to be a positive post about the success classic will have? However it's worded so poorly it's really hard to see clearly what point you're trying to get across.

---
hopefully all of them. I sadly haven't been able to play just what I've seen on streams.
---
This is what I was curious about.  Thanks for doing the work.
---
I tossed the data into a [free online calculator](https://www.icalcu.com/stat/chisqtest.html) and got the [following results](https://imgur.com/a/KLQMeyX) from a chi square test:
---
Χ^2 = 153.78
---
DOF = 120
---
p value = 0.0204
---
These results indicate that there is a statistically significant difference in class preference based on MBPI, for at least some of the combinations.  I'll let someone else handle any more detailed analysis.
---
thenk)
---
'better' is wildly subjective and my whole point is that vanilla IS 'better' than TBC for a lot of people
---
Its so cozy.  I actually didnt even start playing dwarves for a long time (though my first couple toons were gnomes), but i always ported to IF largely because it felt like 'home', and the run from the portal room to the AH/ban was easiest.  It also felt like the busiest city (other than Dal) in Wrath, which was when i started.
---
I was actually pretty sad when Cata came along and SW ended up having all the hubs, so it kind of had to be your hearth.  
---
Now that i mostly play Dwarves it feels more like home than ever.
---
Felt really good to do that over the stress test. Once I got to where I could make health stones, I gave out a few to folks as I ran into them. Still have a few folks who don't want to group up, but we will give it time and they will learn. Can't wait till the real thing, it will be a special place for sure.
---
Says you can't tame a pet while you have a pet. Won't let you cast the spell. Shamgar the worg had to be abandoned without fulfilling his destiny.
---
Im horribly out of the loop, someone fill me in. Whats happening to the servers streamers are on and why should they be avoided?
---
My memory isn’t what it used to be. :-(
---
I’ve corrected my original comment, thanks.
---
Esfand when grouped with asmon after asmons stream is done is usually really good stuff.  Non-memeing asmon is super knowledgeable and well articulated.  On his stream he just goes full meme.  Even occasionally on asmon stream you'll get some really good discussions about wow stuff, but yea after that hes back to sperging.
---
Just roll on any other pvp server and your good. That's if they roll pve.
---
I'm hearing from certain people that they don't think there will even be a market for devilsaur the way that there was on PS.
---
The mafia primarily relied on selling their goods to the many thousands of Chinese players who had too high latency to fight them over resources. Devilsaur was such a big thing on PS because the game economy wasn't designed to support tens of thousands of users. On a normal server with a normal population, especially now that servers have layered resources there will be enough devilsaur to go around.
---
From what I've heard people seem to think that uncontested resources are the most reliable way of farming gold. Meaning people who wish to make a lot of gold will seek out instanced content.
---
Invite them to group for aspect of the dazed. They will love you for it.
---
To me from what I read and my exp in a private server, it seems that vanilla is pretty well balanced
---
I posted some other pics in the comments as well, all from original server ^^
---
Ok, glad we are on the same page. I just want to take a few weeks to level a warrior and actually have it feel like an accomplishment. I want to have that journey.
---
Well there were crashes, many !
---
It's easy to understand. Streamers, at least those in question here, are friendship surrogates.          
---
          
---
Think about how you choose your friends. What you value in them, how you choose them, what makes a good friend for you. Odds are, having sterling personalities or being wunderkind at games do not rank highly among the criteria.          
---
              
---
Think about how you show appreciation for good friends. You give them gifts, you invite  them over for meals,  you do them favors when they're down on their luck.           
---
             
---
People choose streamers based on their criteria for friends, not based on a 'value added' transaction basis, and they give donations in the same way you might buy a friend a beer. Whether or not the streamer is 'good' at what they do doesn't matter. What matters is the common ground and personal attachment.          
---
            
---
Is a streamer actually a viewer's friend? Of course not. But they engage with their audience as if they were, and it sparks this friendship response. They call them their 'crew' or their 'boys', they talk to them, make jokes with them, react to things with them all the way you would when hanging out with a friend IRL. And they use that connection to generate revenue.          
---
           
---
And I say all this as a dude who has streams on in the background while playing games fairly often. It's fun and goofy the way hanging out with a friend is, and people like that, and it's evident from the messages people leave when donating that it's never about paying for quality services, but rather about the streamer making them laugh or just being around...the same way you might thank a friend by buying them lunch.
---
ha im watching skarm right now! 
---
ty i know you cant tank as paladin, i am just torn between paladin and tanking basically.
---
Im not worried about leveling as warrior and paladin are similar leveling speeds but paladin gets an earlier power up at level 20, where as warriors is 40 but after that its easier than paladin.
---
Ya but if my axe skill is 100/100 and my mace skill is 50/100 and a mage comes along and gives me AI I still don't have a mace in my bag to use so the buff is useless, and if I do have a mace in my bag that's better than my axe I'll just go grind some lower level mobs for 10 mins to max out my mace skill, if a mage comes along at that point.. great! All in all 99% of the time its useless, I've leveled several warriors to 60 and received many AI buffs along the way and it was never useful lol. I'll take fortitude though that's always useful for anyone.
---
As a Paladin I always put Wisdom on the Warlock pets. I know how much of a pain it is when they oom.
---
No transfers at all
---
Warlocks summoning with soul shard management, ritual of doom/infenro with enslave demon, Mages portals, hunter ammo and pet system, rogues poison prefession and lockpicking.
---
I know a lot of this didn't go away in TBC or wrath, but it's all vanilla class design. Yeah DK had runeforging, but over the years the moved away from this kind of stuff rather than embrace and develop it.
---
It won't matter. There will always be a shortage of tanks in 5-man content. Always. And for guilds... it'll be difficult to find a spot as a raid tank, since those are usually taken by the GM or GM's real life friends, but every guild will want a million dps warriors, since they are the biggest dps. Warrior is possibly the best class choice in classic.
---
It's completely harmless and more importantly victimless. It's not a joke at anyone's expense. If you get offended by it then that's your problem.
---
Its nice that you actually bug tested as opposed to almost every single “content creator,” but it is working as intended.
---
Frostadamus and everyone else says you’re wrong about priests. 
---
Video evidence: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0aY-PaThavU
---
Are you feeling ok ?
---
The whole point of the comment is that they’re not announcing their server, you won’t be able to know what servers they’re rolling on before it’s too late unless you’re okay being forced to reroll once they’ve announced. Also just playing an entirely different realm type is an awful suggestion.
---
You get more gold from completing quest at "max level" which was 5 then 10.
---
The quests I saw varies from 20s to 75s
---
Strangest feeling CN jokes are about to become Trump and border wall jokes.
---
&gt; 4) it didn't make sense in terms of lore how arena was implemented. There is something intrisicly that makes sense about PvP rewards in vanilla, like your faction rewarding you in the war effort. In TBC it was just "hey this new arena thing and they somehow have all this epic gear to hand out depending on your ranking!"
---
Blizzard also introduced this problem with tokens that trade for gear. I could never not think "This guy's got a cart full of the best gear in the world and he spends his time trading it away for tokens? Shouldn't this place be better guarded? .... Why aren't we raiding this guy?"
---
streamer BAD
---
At least they were cool enough to  not instantly kill you and allow tension to build. That's what makes the game fun.
---
Death to Omar in chat D:
---
Agreed completely.  And TBC is ‘better’ for a lot of people as well.  The only person I can speak for is myself, and that’s my belief.
---
I don't get it?
---
You turn on retaliation/shield wall and drink a potion, and then hope you don't do it again before your CDs refresh.
---
I'm being generous and assuming he's referring to layering and other significant things like that.
---
But in all likelihood it's probably the inclusion of the modern raid frames and updated shadow resolution.
---
That wouldnt be possible in regular Vanilla. Please report it as a bug. When they changed zones in retail to scale with your level they changed it so you could tame pets 2 levels higher than you. This has never been the case before. I have played hunter for 14 years and i was an absolute pet maniac, taming all the rare spawns in Azeroth and it was never possible to tame a pet higher level than you
---
They will eventually buy just not during launch which makes sense
---
Final Fantasy XIV has a card game, you can challenge inn-keepers and collect cards from certain drops and events. It's not as robust as, say hearthstone, but it's an interesting side activity if it's your sort of thing.
---
Im sure there’s a really good reason but why didn’t Sylvanias use the throne in the throne room (fortified of course so it’s protected)?
---
buy it at 10c above vendor cost because there will be an influx the first month of playing.
---
Ur so smart. Ty
---
ZF is awesome. So many quests so you get so much xp for running it.
---
You don't beat WoW. WoW beats you.
---
Nicely done sir! This is a winner!
---
Ret paladin has slower killing capacity unless they're geared to the teeth, but much more survivability. You won't have a slow/root, and all of your big hits will be coming from auto attack crits and seal of command crits. 
---
Warrior has faster killing capacity since you don't have a mana bar and thrive off getting crits. More crits = more rage. More rage = more options. Don't listen to the folks saying it's just face rolling mortal strike/bloodthirst while spamming hamstring. You have stances for a reason. Learn the ins and outs of what stance to be in for various situations (like disarming a ret paladin when they get in range, putting on a shield and going d-stance when a rogue is opening up on you, etc.) Warriors are a dime a dozen. GOOD warriors are hard to come by and are a very valuable asset.
---
Ran into 3 gnome Rogues once that were different combinations of I's and L's  e.g. "Ilililli", "Ilililll", "Ililillii" they were difficult to click and /tar Ililill was basically useless.
---
i was like 8 when i started playing in vanilla and i couldn’t figure out why all the other hunters could have pets and i couldn’t, didn’t realize i had to do the quest until level 14
---
Nope
---
It's not. I am a horde loyalist so I will play horde no matter what but, If you wanna pvp in BG's at the highest levels. Paladins are the best support in the game and it's not close. If your a neck beard who just wants to win. You'll be playing Ally. Most top players will be going alliance for this reason. Unless blizz nerfs pally s it's inevitable.
---
a truly sad thing that i can only upvote this once &lt;
---
I think (non-trauma) surgeons are closer to banker's hours, but still surgeries have a higher mortality/accident rate later in the day. Get that first slot of the day for best results.
---
I'll definitely report next stress test!
---
I don't. I am just tired of seeing thread after thread with the same complaints about the same people every day. It's just getting old.
---
At minimum we should make flairs for posts in this sub and we can at least flair these threads as streamer hate. If ya'll wana circle jerk about it then whatever, at least the people who don't wana hear it can just filter it.
---
The constant complaining doesn't even have anything to do with classic wow at this point.
---
This is a very elaborate shitpost
---
&gt;That said, TBC had the better class design and game play than vanilla, and it did so by a similar margin.
---
So does BFA
---
&gt;The organic integration of quests, zones, dungeons and characters that make the world live. Gnomergan, Zul'Farak, even Sunken Temple are world design wise far superior to TBC dungeons, and incomparably better than anything from WOTLK on where they just turned them in to loot pinata gauntlets.
---
The whole point to classic being vanilla WoW and no TBC
---
&gt; Under the current wow TOS repetitive ganking or spawn camping is considered harassment, and could get you banned.
---
Needs citation
---
10 lvl 15s was fun af
---
Remember the Barov trinket? It would summon three peasants to fight for you. One tactic is to just have the entire raid equip that trinket and let 120 peasants soak the damage during her enrage.
---
Last night I caught some of Rich Campbell (allcraft guy) and I must admit, I laughed quite a bit for a good 5 mins lol.  He's vulgar, memey, probably spergy too but he named his druid methodjosh and talks alot of smack about the other streamers (all part of his act).  Him T-bagging venruki talking smack then the clip made its way to venruki's stream, I was dying lol.  Then he T-bagged Soni and did fake RP while doing it then trashed RPers for a few mins.  I will admit I was entertained lol.  Maybe it was just a good 5 min section, but was a fun change of pace.  
---
I mainly prefer preach but he's EU so he streams while I work so I mainly catch Esfand.
---
Fucking badass
---
Same.  I'm only subscribed to WoW so I don't feel guilty about playing on a P Server.
---
I don't think you can buy transfers in classic
---
Shouldn't be too hard to avoid asmon and soda, not really worried about anyone else. Worst comes to worst they eventually enable server transfers and maybe offer it for free for people on a steamer server
---
How old do you gotta be to go on the internet and pull a “I told you so” to not even the same people who originally said it?
---
Defeated by trying to cheekily express myself through text once again. I would have gotten away with it too if it hadn't been for those meddlin' downvotes.
---
They have maraudon in launch so now you won't be completely out of options as long as you have a flight to desolace.
---
I got cancer trying to figure out this post.
---
I am getting into policing in Canada and its the same here, 12 hour shifts 4 on 4 off/ 3 on 3 off. Personally its also a preferred method of work, you work hard and grind, then enjoy days off!
---
You keep talking around your original point. If you have a product that’s losing customers faster then it’s gaining them it’s a bad product one way or another. If the game was good at acquiring new customers and keeping them the product would have a growing player base. It clearly doesn’t attract new players or keep them playing.
---
You can bend over backwards trying to defend the product saying stuff like “bounds of chemical human brain tolerance“ it’s just bullshit. For example their are some old games that are still going strong, Like league of legends, dota, and counterstrike. Despite being a decade or two old they are still heavy hitters in the scene because they stayed true to the target audience and attract new players.
---
yeah but i PvP'ed more than anything and the immune to Disarm was just too good for what I did.
---
Renewing my account just to play classic. Spending half a day on refresher courses so far now too lol.
---
The horde we're mad Omar went to the alliance and not the horde. It was real bad in trade chat lol.
---
Ironically, your condescending demeanour is exactly what you are criticizing them for.
---
It is definately a bug. 14 years of hunter experience and avid petopia user. I had servers full of max level hunters and I would always plan on which rare spawn to tame next at my level. It changed when zone scaling was introduced
---
Until you found out you could just stand on the ledges and avoid the fire entirely. I wonder if that will be in Classic.
---
Yup, this. Even as a top hpala, resto druids were just gods.
---
It took me 7 months apparently. Lol.
---
Not crying at all lol, just wondering why you cant read what op said, you also seem tho think you only use life tap once or twice a fight? Don’t believe you for even a second based on that alone lol...
---
One thing you didn’t mention is that loot competition is going to be worse for warriors than any other class.
---
Dwarf hunter is amazing. Much stronger than NE IMO. Stoneform is very OP, especially against rogues and UD shadow priest (devouring plague).
---
What? Why would it matter when the servers went up?
---
And its nothing to do with avoiding nationalities and to do with what language you want to talk in. 
---
If hun had hun servers it would be the same.
---
That wasn't my experience, but sure.  I was the mortal-strike/hybrid off tank and I was in the gear rotation just like the rest of my guild.
---

As a Hunter it's all I can give

My friend who doesn’t play WoW pitched said “Old Gnome Rogue” when I was discussing what builds I wanted to go with and now I need to make a guild with that name
---
A great knight by the name Luvs2spooge will have to wait...
---
Where is the line? Is it bannable anytime you or the opposite faction come across eachother in the world and deicde not to attack? From blizzards perspective, there is no perceptible communication. same as there would be if horde and alliance colluded to secure devilsaur leather. All communication would occur over Discord. 
---
Blizzard has 0 hard evidence of collusion, yet you say ban? Whats to stop me from reporting a horde and alliance I see minding their own business grinding Pirates in Tanaris--based on your low level for evidence thats bannable too. Say goodbye to your spot and your account, now that youre gone, ill be grinding there.
---
Crying about collusion in a video game is weak form. Collude with your own people and get good. Its a social game. Not everything is there for you to win without effort. 
---
Will I seek to collude? Highly unlikely. Do I have a philosophical disagreement with it? Not in the slightest. 
---
Its a slippery slope. When you start saying "who cares, ban them" its pretty clear youre not thinking objectively about the ramifications of blizzard willy nilly banning people for perceived collusion. Also Collusion was 100% a thing in vanilla, my guild had the ventrilo servers of every alliance raiding guild. My BC guild was half rerolls from alliance, people we'd become friends with over fighting in the world, bgs and finding the common good in fucking over other guilds we disliked.
---
I ain’t no understand your post please clarify.
---
&gt;TBC was terrible for the game.
---
You're listing everything that is bad about TBC without talking about the good. Classic has flaws as well. For many people, the good in TBC outweighs the bad.
---
Hello and welcome to my blocked list. I’m also flagging your shit videos.
---
Are people just nope-ing out of there when they see him on the other team or something? If so that's pretty hilarious.      
---
'You'll stand there and take your beating and you'll *LIKE* it!'
---
the thing for me is that TBC is pretty much the same as classic only that it directed your path at the end to things you could do and changed thing based on testing in vanilla (ZG raid)
---
even the majority of WotLK is very classic like in the design. the only changes comes in at the ToC patch. you change it so ToC is catch up raid (like ZG and ZA before) thus reducing ilvl bloat and you do the same for ICC in terms of ilvl and then lastly you remove the LFG and cross-realm stuff they did and it is honestly good to be a classic experiance.
---
the wife just said it would be a ten minute wait. Awesome!
---
A subreddit's active users are typically like 1% or less of the actual game population. The community here is in no way indicative of what it will be like in game, so I wouldn't worry about it too much.
---
I agree that it is not an ideal situation for Classic, for the same reasons sharding isn't. That said, I think it's still a slightly less terrible solution that opening a ton of servers to handle the influx of players then shutting them down, transferring, and forcing name changes on players who had the bad luck to roll on one of several realms that lost a loooot of tourists and lookyloos.
---
If layering lasts beyond phase 1, though, I think a lot of us will change our attitudes toward it really quick. It's an "okay-I-guess" solution to launch hype, but definitely doesn't belong long-term, nor is it planned to (so far). So far it's just an alternative to opening then closing a ton of servers (because a huge chunk of players slough off with literally every game ever and it will happen here, too) or sitting in a 5+ hour queue while the server crashes every 10 minutes and you have to relog and start your queue over.
---
Sonii and Venruki are the only ones I've found that I can stand. I watch them specifically because they play mage and warrior on the Horde side and don't group up with Asmond like some of the alliance steamers do....Had to stop watching StaySafe for that reason, the group streams were really weird.
---
But the fact that players are leaving in this expansion is inexorably tied to the fact that they played for X hours in the last expansion. And the one before that. And before that.
---
Nothing is like WoW and nothing is comparable to it. No other kind of game instills in its players this strong sense of emotional attachment and investment that keeps them playing long past the point of burnout and alters their perceptions of future content.
---
Can't help it, just the way the brain works.

With 501 intellect the time to max skill was roughly one quarter of the time it took to max out with no int.
---
Unless you put on full wizard robes, int is basically worthless. Especially while leveling, because it's not until you hit the 200-250 range that things begin to slow down.
---
its just muscle memory like more difficult chords on a guitar or piano, many hours of practice and it becomes second nature.
---
Except at at some point the game will die if there's no new titles, or new superficial things to chase.

What is this tingling sensation I feel
---
I like this, being able to make use of those art assets and collectable rewards while not introducing all the problems that were side effects of flying.
---
I've also thought about having a more restricted version of flying; you can only mount them at flight points, combat or damage immediately dismount you from flying mounts, and give flying mounts a stamina bar that is like an inverse breath bar. When flying drain stamina, when on the ground slowly restore it.
---
So they become more of a "get me out into the field faster" tool, rather than a "get me from anywhere to anywhere faster" tool.  You'd still be using your ground mount while doing anything in the world.
---
Lol, druids became so overpowered, almost like an apology for their state in Vanilla. Resto was a god in PVP and PVE

I’m sure some people wanted that stuff(I never saw people ask for it, but I’m sure there was forum stuff), but there wasn’t a voting system like OS Runescape, and we now have the knowledge of hindsight. Also with this method, it would still be up to Blizzard to say what would be voted on. It wouldn’t be monkeys running the zoo, it would be monkeys ratifying the zoo.

I have but I am pretty sure they are aware

Oh I would so want in on this lmao

Hahahahaha I thought it was serious for a moment!

Venruki is a guy who will not lose his temper or throw a tantrum. He also happens to be one of the top PvP players around.

The ledges were in the wrath release. However, in the wrath version you could be feared off the ledge, still causing fire damage.

Or do what I did and grind venture Co mobs in stv as a pally with 1h + shield and seal of light.

Now if it was dodgeball we're really having fun.
---
Lol where did you get that idea from? Private servers having been running for years and people are happy with that.
---
The question is tank or DPS. I played a tank warrior from Cata onward. I never got to experience raiding hardcore and I would love to dedicate as much time as possible to being a tank. I work full time so this might not even be a possibility. I understand most decent guilds have their MT as the GM or a friend of the GM. I also know that prot is pretty sucky in wPvP but can fill niche rolls in BG's. Considering all this is putting a big damper on my ambition to play warrior but I still have that fire in my heart for the sword n board. Getting easy 5 mans will be nice all the way until 60 as well because my friend will be playing priest. DPS can do BG's wPvP raids and everything else but there's so many other DPS warriors. Am I selling myself short by playing a tank to 60 and not even being a MT? I feel like I should just DPS with what time I'll have but that's not totally where my heart is.
---

NPC's crit chance and damages are affected by resilience, I agree that in almost every case it doesn't matter but sometime it does.
---
I get your point, but even if you indeed need to do arenas where there are 4 / 6 / 10 players on the map to get the best PvP gear, you can use it anywhere else, world PvP, BGs, or even start PvE (you can start on T5 easily with S4 gear) which do not break immersion as those are more or less the same as vanilla.
---
Hunter or Rogue.  Hunter, you can just snipe the shit out of people.  Rogues can pick and choose when you want to get involved and who you want to take down first.
---
Lol no.
---
I haven't played since TBC, so I honestly didn't know. It wouldn't be the weirdest thing I've read about how the game currently is.
---
&gt; Yea because carrying around 4 different sets of gear is loads of fun 🤔.
---
*laughs in Druid*
---
Saw this on a stream. Warrior vs hunter duel. After the duel ended the hunter's pet continued to follow the warrior around.
---
For instance, apparently Gnomes can be hunters now...
---
Ah yeah that would doit, if you were expected to tank you were still looking for tier. 
---
My Guild was very much warrior bloated and we had several warrior who I believe never did the level 10 quest to get defensive stance TBH. All fine players but the ones who were never expected to tank almost never went for tier pieces unless they had hit or crit, they never cared for a moment about Set bonus's.
---
I get what you're saying, but main cities are not sharded on retail.
---
I wouldn't say it 'pales'. At least it's consistent and reliable..aoe and on a short cooldown. I played an orc shaman recently on a pserver and felt like it was barely proccing.
---
That matches his race/class/level and zone?
---
Classic+ sounds good to me. An alternate timeline, if you will. One where the angry mobs of the forums don't dictate changes, but instead in-game voting maybe like OSRS.
---
If you keep adding attunements though then new players have too many hurdles to get to new content. The pool of players will shrink over time. Not to mention that raiding actually doesn't draw in many players to begin with. Back in vanilla there was very very very few players that ever set foot in a raid. 
---
Fact is that if you have to do every raid tier to get to the newest content anyone new to the game or that took a break will have a hard time getting up to speed and likely wont bother. That's murder on the raid community.
---
I know this comment is like 2 months old but I’d love an explanation about prowl and shadowmeld? Or more specifically what are the uses of shadowmeld? I’m trying to decide between NE and Dward and it seemed like just an okay ability to me.
---
i mean if he had that before ...im with him at this one...unless she is his step mother...
---
Well thats pretty fucking selfish of them. Those 3 people are bound to find out like literally within 24 hours.. all it will take is one dude doing /who's on every server to find the strimmer. It'd really fucking suck to learn you'd accidentally rolled on Sodapoppin's server at like level 25.
---
The most efficient 1 to 300 Tailoring doesn't have you make many DE-able items, only:
---
* 5 Black Mageweave Leggings
---
* 10 Black Mageweave Gloves
---
* 20 Black Mageweave Headband
---
* 15 Runecloth Belt
---
* 20 Runecloth Gloves
---
That'll net you about (assuming you don't get unlucky with shards):
---
* 39 Vision Dust (you need 171 total)
---
* 23 Lesser Nether Essence (you need 72 total)
---
* 114 Dream Dust (you need 338 total)
---
* 11 Lesser Eternal Essence (you need 12 total)
---
You'll still need to come up with:
---
* 206 Strange Dust
---
* 74 Lesser Magic Essence
---
* 10 Lesser Astral Essence
---
* 67 Soul Dust
---
* 6 Lesser Astral Essence
---
* 20 Lesser Mystic Essence
---
* 82 Illusion Dust
---
* 4 Small Brilliant Shards (you might get lucky and get 1 of these from Tailoring)
---
* 2 Large Brilliant Shards
---
A better plan is to take up Skinning and Herbalism/Mining as soon as you can. Keep all DE-able non-Weapon quest rewards in your bank. When your leveling pace starts to mean you can no longer herb or mine in the zone, switch to Enchanting and start DE-ing everything (again, vendor weapons). Buy up cheap/shitty greens from the AH too.
---
Then, once you have all the materials, realize Enchanting is a huge gold sink that rarely makes any revenue, certainly won't get you your investment back, and sell all the materials at once to buy your Epic Mount.
---
I am looking forward to updated Chuck Norris jokes
---
Unfortunately for clothies it will ever only really play a role on Sapphiron. The other resistance encounters can be avoided.
---
The downside of a paladin offtank is that their dps is gutter tier when they aren't tanking.  
---
Off tank warriors and druids can at least hit middle of the road numbers.
---
Oh yeah. That’s the thing with classic. It’s an adventure. An entire world which is always relevant. Not an expansion where there are 4 zones that are relevant. Ull explore woods, magical forests, deserts, jungles, mountains, snowy terrain. Meeting other adventurers ull see time and time again. Not ppl ull never see again, where it’s faster to solo, and every1 can 1hit mobs. All classes have the same thing. One healing ability etc. Where every1 can do the same. Sit and wait in ques. The gear. Everything is relevant, weapons have different speeds etc. I can go on forever
---
If they bring out a TBC server, you don’t have to play on it..
---
I played a lot during TBC.  I liked resilience because it meant I wasn't forced to raid in order to attain high-end PVP gear...I could just PVP for it instead.
---
The actual stat could have been better though.
---
Looks like Barrens chat is back on the menu boys!
---
Hi, /u/kindredfan
---
Nice thing about Attunements was it weeds out the lazy players(i mean not all are lazy some just have trouble finding groups to do them)
---
1 Barov Peasant = 2.5 Spartans
---
Shield is really nice for AOE tanking.  Not a must have but can make trash and dungeons go a lot faster.
---
Most of the time right click is used to move and turn your character. It's also easy to miss the right character and numerous other reasons.
---
The comments here are really over the top, I started in cata but got beta and it's really not that bad... I thought I would dying every 3 seconds the way everyone howls about it being so hard but it's really just a patience check and making sure everything is right when you pull. Nothing "hard".
---
&gt;My vanilla guild did the first bosses of AQ40 right outta MC, and was half way through AQ40 before we killed Nefarian. We did the first couple of bosses of Naxx shortly after Nefarian, and we never did clear AQ40 past Twin Emps.
---
Is it possible that you are misremembering this?
---
&gt; poeple that never played vanilla start thinking wtf is this game. 
---
GUd thing thet i wornde you
---
Just because that's how it was for illegal pservers does not mean that's the only option available to Blizzard. Restarting over and over was a product of getting shutdown, not a conscious design choice that the servers or players wanted. Broader possibilities are out there. I'm just excited to see what comes after Naxx.
---
&gt;Thus movement speed is the best way to assure highest G/H returns
---
I mean... you are just incorrect? You're oversimplifying it. Shamans and druids are two of the fastest classes in the game, with huge move speed boosts. There's tons of move speed items like nifty stopwatch and run speed pots. Are these top tier gold farming classes/items? No. You're leaving out clear speed, downtime, and value of targets. All of those play just as important roles in g/hr, which is the easiest metric to measure and the only one that matters.
---
Not to mention, when you're talking level 60 farming, move speed is effectively normalized by epic mounts; or you're talking about instance farming where you're more capped by reset limits per hour over movement speed.
---
&gt;Priest cannot AoE farm shit
---
They can AoE farm lashers in int prioritized leveling greens. DME lashers can easily get you 40+ g/hr even on a priest. They're no mage, but they can make plenty of gold with holy nova AoE farming.
---
General? I guess, if having a 1 way time delayed broadcast makes you a leader. 
---
There were "generals" in vanilla. We knew who the IGLs were of the opposing premades and healers or not, we'd fucking light them up first. Erode the Command and Control and/or remove their Main Assist from the fight. It breeds GCDs of chaos and confusion, allowing you the advantage. The difference in classic was the IGL usually earned his spot at the table by having a big "vanilla brain". Sure many streamers are terrific players. But some are "generals" due to fame not ability. Every IGL in vanilla was there cause of ability.
---
second frame of this video is even better!
---
fine ill freaking do engi
---
Undercity is the place you visit on vacation and plan to stay at for an hour, but end up getting lost and hungry in for the entire day and then you finally make it out due to divine intervention and you run as fast as you can away and never return. 
---
Orgrimmar is the chill place you go to live and everyone knows you, but not to an annoyingly nosey level.
---
I think it was actually a bug how it generated threat in vanilla.  It was intended to do flat 50 but instead it was 55 per person receiving the buff.
---
Where exactly is this I want to experience it in classic on release? Not familiar with auberdine
---
Are you talking about premades or PUGs?
---
High impact classes are usually healers, arms warriors, and (in WSG) flagrunners (Druid-S, Mage-A). The other commentor mentioned rogues, which are strong at ganking, but I wouldn't recommend them for organized PvP.
---
yeah and theyre not like 99% kickbotters anymore
---
7, all 6 bfa zonez, plus sw.
---
Monkeynews aka Mn aka Moo_UK on twitch. One of the best vanilla warriors I’ve watched for both pvp and pve
---
Awesome thank you!
---
I feel like there’s still a ton of value from being able to use bombs when you shift out of the animal forms.
---
Similar to you I plan on doing enchanting/engineering. Maybe enchanting/mining while I level to get mats for engineering later on. But my main focus is pvp
---
Then the streamer just goes “ALRIGHT BOYS FORM UP” and 1000 sweaty nerds in chat log on to their characters and camp your guild in shifts forever while saying a bunch of stuff you don't understand like “pogchamp” or “4head”.
---
Anything rly, all classes are good with r10 gear
---
You can't do that on a private server though. Not a good one anyhow.
---
Weren't the sets in AQ mostly horrible? Sidegrades at best from T2, wich is why they were called Tier 2.5?
---
The druid set atleast, sure, it was the first set with some feral stats, but it also had balance stats and resto stats, wich meant that you could probably find blue gear with better stats for your spec.
---
if I had a disc priest with shadow weaving that was going to heal or a shadow priest with shadow weaving that was going to dps.  I would take the disc priest, because the overall dps of the shadow talent dots on a 6-9 minute fight is going to be negligible when compared to the heals, non shadow dots and wand dps of the disc priest.
---
well the first wand, the first enchanter trainer in capital city has all the materials needed (dust and essence in limited supply). You only need a 1 enchanting to disenchant anything.
---
So you could make your enchanting rod, then make your wand if lucky, then check AH if not.. 
---
 As a clothie, your going to get a ton of crap you can't use (chain, leather, etc) so you'll be able to make your wand in short while.  by the time you get to 13, you should have enough items saved up to either make the second wand, or trade materials to someone that  can. (just check /trade everytime your in town and you have the mats)
---
Quasi-raid spec, you can probably get away with it tbh because horde is usually desperate for shamans but probably in phase 1, it'll just be easier to go deep resto and switch to a resto/ele spec once your gear is better (e.g. more spell crit).
---
Ah shit that’s true. I totally forgot they are adding everything for 1.12. 
---
Will the cenarion hold quests for silithus be operational?  That makes the 57-60 circuit a lot easier
---
Thanks a lot! I dont know, it looked cool to me so I just went for it! And i’ve already gotten a couple lok’tar ogars on the streets from random people lol
---
A big con was resilience keeping crit reliant specs (feral, assassination, fire) out of arena.
---
That is my memory as well, guess we will just have to trust Blizz.
---
I have it buried in my head that Improved Bloodrage is really good for leveling and worth the 7 point dip in Prot. Is that wrong? I think I learned it from my old school buddy who started playing in the vanilla beta test; maybe it was true on earlier patches but isn't for 1.12?
---
Clearly not a juicer here.
---
On classic ill main ally since thats what i did back then- now i main horde for my guild
---
Hahah thats right. This one is the 100% too, the grind will be real 😩
---
Possibly, i guess im not sure whether Sylvanas would join Kil'jaeden against Arthas.
---
While I cant say for certain, my Paladin (TBC private server) seems to gain weapon skills much quicker than non-int based classes.

---
58-60 is fun because at that level range you can actually start doing endgame stuff and working on getting what you need to head into raids.
---
I'm thinking about dual-boxing a warrior and paladin, since they are slow to level, but powerful end game.  I think their rotations all the way up to 60 will be relatively early. I'm worried about hit boxes/attack ranges, making sure they both can hit the target. What else should I be worried about or will throw a kink in my plans?
---
Hi, /u/FarWoods
---
You can AOE tank in 5 mans as warrior, it takes more effort though.
---
For example trinkets and engineering.
---
In phase 3 or 4 or whatever adds ST you can get the Chained Essence of Eranikus for AOE damage and threat gen.
---
Before that, as an engineer you can pull with grenades/bombs for instant snap threat on groups, use sapper charges mid combat, and use the engineering Force Reactive Disk shield which is great for AOE tanking.  
---
Druid probably has more AOE threat still, particularly since they can just make so much more threat with pummeler, but you don't want to farm pummelers all the damn time do you?
---
It’s even worse for us US players because most big streamers are going to do their best to hide what server they’re playing on. How am I supposed to know what servers to avoid if they’re trying so hard to “prevent stream snipers”? That’s what they signed up for!
---
That's exactly my point, thanks for the reply :)
---
Yeah, AoE Looting is very immersion breaking. But it also has gameplay impacts as well if that's a way to persuade people. A lot of players miss looting corpses while leveling, or just simply can't be bothered. Watch streamers playing the beta and you'll see it all the time. Those corpses could contain greens, blues, or even epics that would never enter the economy without AoE Looting.
---
Having to loot each corpse also has a very real impact on leveling and grinding speeds.
---
Nothing in this thread is saying that it's difficult execute mechanically, they're saying it's a grind.
---
Always disliked it due to getting lost all the fucking time
---
Feral end game tanking and dpsing is Engineering and Blacksmithing.  Being able to apply your own stones is important. But alchemy wouldn't be bad.  
---
You'll want to take enchanting and get the Smoking Heart of the Mountain trinket. Good armor and resistance so good for a while.  Drop enchanting for one of the prior professions.  Honestly, Engineering is nearly a basic requirement for a Vanilla tank.  
---
You can level whatever you like, but that's how I'll be handling end game professions on my druid.  I'm playing all three roles. I'm third raid tank, heal and dps otherwise.
---
That’s kind of what I liked about Legion, getting the healing classes into the fights instead of having them sit silently between damage windows. But like you said, I don’t think most encounters are ever going to work better with hybrids over dedicated balls-out healers and DPS.
---
The only exception I can think of is C’thun, which is my favorite fight in all of WoW. As a Paladin in Phase 1 I chose to wear T2.5 and a 2H because it helped me kill tentacles while letting me off-heal. Or let me DPS inside the stomach while keeping people alive. Or let me DPS C’thun when he was weakened.
---
I think those are the types of fights we need more of — multi-phase, multi-role, multi-responsibility, forcing people to balance around them. Like, imagine a right where your raid is essentially split into eight separate 5-man groups for a phase. You’d only need 8 healers instead of the traditional 11-14. But once that phase ends you need those 3-6 people to go back to healing the raid.
---
If this subreddit did a picture of the day/week this would win
---
Can someone tell me why being on a streamer's server is a bad idea? What affects does it have? (honest question)
---
Weird, wonder if that's itnended
---
hoping to god it'll be pre 1.11 version because other version is complete cancer.
---
Because beta selection is entirely random and Blizzard has no way to know how people are going to act after receiving an invite
---
You might be interested in /u/Flavus_Whitfoot 's comment in which he did a similar analysis.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/buvoap/without_further_ado_i_present_the_results_wow/epk2k6g/
---
If you plan on leveling fast as fuck and getting ahead on your server go skinning with leatherworking. You can farm devilsaurs and create 2 of the best pre raid BIS to sell for big profits. After that rush switch to herb/alc. That is my plan, make money on the initial launch/raids and then focus on long term pots!
---
My friends and I are playing Horde because that was the consensus. I am cool with Horde and love the races, but damn do the Horde cities suck. I really wish I could play Horde and still have Ironforge.
---
Orc for stun resist or tauren for warstomp. Ele/resto spec for reduced lb/cl cast time and down resto for NS. More of a utility+healer, follow warrior around in bgs for windfury+purge, totems and heals.
---
Makes sense. Like I said, graphics don't matter to me so I was just curious to know why the character models were important to you.
---
Personally I have no problem with them adding better graphics as long as they were something that could be toggled on/off and they were careful to make sure the graphics didn't change the game play. I might even use the updated graphics for the world myself if it were available. 
---
I definitely wouldn't use the new character models though because imo they look worse than the originals to me lol. That may be just nostalgia but I can't stand the new models when I've played BFA for some reason. Again, I wouldn't mind if they did add a toggle for character models though... Not like it affects me if someone sees the new models lol. Lots of people used model changers in classic anyway. Never made a difference to me if someone saw an undead model on their character from their PoV instead of the disgusting gnome they actually were.
---
I think every expansion should be an option eventually. If people want to play Cata they should be able to. Sorry if that hurts your gaming experience somehow, that's being selfish.
---
I'm sure they will. Stream creation on the wrong servers. Create actual characters somewhere else.
---
Sm ruin is still pretty good in pvp, there’s a reason lots of locks go sm ruin for raids even though it’s slightly less dps than ds ruin, saves about 100g a week for a spec that’s still fantastic in pvp.
---
Do you think its possible that people are downvoting because it just wasn't that good?
---
Engineering is almost a requirement for an mt. Grenades/sapper charges and a force reactive disc makes warrior aoe tanking a real thing.
---
The_mechanic is not good
---
That's pretty funny though.
---
Anything except rogue or druid. Hours of flag/node guarding gets very old.
---
If you really want to get technical:
---
It's 4,069,300 XP to Level 60. 
---
Half of that is 2,034,650.
---
It's 2,014,400 to Level 48.
---
So the halfway point is ~15% into Level 49.
---
No wonder they didn’t get Omar like we did , just look at that mess.
---
60 some odd members. Seems like the proper place to really get your views seen! let's all head over there.................................... Gotta start somewhere I suppose.
---
yeah I  have no idea why I am getting down voted for this

 If you’re eager to claim your character name in WoW Classic, take note: we’ll be opening character creation on Tuesday, August 13.\*\* Players with an active subscription or game time on their account will be able to create up to three characters per World of Warcraft account. We’ll have more information on realm names closer to launch, but rest assured—you’ll have plenty of time to figure out your plans for realm domination!
---
Did mangeclaw had bonus stats?
---
what do you think people will stream at 60?  it'll be dungeons/raids/wpvp and then BGs when they come out.  thats been the core gameplay of wow forever
---
I always grabbed the bracers from Lord Incendius, the helm from Rend/Gyth, the boots from rend for those early rag kills. Great Fire Protection Pots, that gear and being in the shaman/paladin group made ranged dps/healing pretty comfy.
---
It's not a genuine wow experience without a bit of toxicity. Also who says their account isn't 15 years old either.
---
30-40 isn't that bad esp if you're a fan of SM.   40-50 blows....hard.
---
NE priest here. I feel your pain with orc hunters.
---
They are summoning the guy that turned back time.
---
Honestly good lord though, retail WoW's cinematics are written worse than Grey's Anatomy level shitty B drama storyline. 
---
Everything's gotta be DARK and EMOTIONAL and LOSS and SADNESS but this time there's JAINA and BETRAYAL and she's SAD AGAIN
---
Jesus fucking christ cool it with the writing, Shakespeare, I can only handle so much expertly crafted, genuine emotion.
---
Is the FoV on the classic client the same as in vanilla? If it's changed that would also make a visual difference.
---
The point is people play with those who speak the same language because it's the natural thing to do, not because of their relation to English speakers. I find your assumption ("they chose a french server specifically to get away from speaking english") to be quite ofensive.
---
The server selection screen? Doesn't it tell you the population level in low,med high and full?
---
And here today, I watched two opposing points of view come together in mutual respect and understanding. I commend you both.
---
Was so amazing that he showed up, team R for life.
---
...I never said it did. More power to those people.
---
Only situation I think it would matter is if it came down to more content for classic in the vein of vanilla versus just re-releasing later expansions.
---
PVP gear won't be seeing enchants until we're well into AQ. QQ.
---
When they say "genuine players" they mean "me".
---
Barely any difference faster, it takes mere seconds to loot. It's just inconvenience. Won't make a difference to the market.
---
Really, the biggest damage from fury is Flurry.
---
This topic gets posted here over 20 times a day. I don't understand why these people think everyone wants to hear their unoriginal thoughts.
---
Is that Arcane Mage? What kind of spec would they run as flag carrier?
---
Fair point!
---
Well aware or not more reports are better.
---
Dude posted a list and had 0 hunters for alliance so I posted the two I know who stream. Maybe you have an alliance hunter stream recommendation instead?
---
What? I'm out of the loop
---
That wasn't toxicity, it was a pickup line.  Or did you mean the OP?
---
Feral till 21 (Feline Swiftness) for 30% more movement speed. You spend like 30% of your time just traveling, so shortening that time just translates to pure leveling speed.
---
After that, you have a lot of choices, but going 14 into balance for Natural Weapons, Natural Shapeshifter, and Omen of Clarity is possibly the best / most efficient. Let's you get max rank Regrowths while leveling without adding to downtime.
---
Alternatively you could go 5/5 Furor after Feline Swiftness. Longer downtimes, less frequently.
---
They're OP and you'll roflstomp everyone.
---
FF14 has pretty much what he's describing. The Triple Triad game from FF8 is playable in 14. a lot of bosses drop cards you can add to your collection, you can play people in designated areas, and then at the gold saucer there's weekly tournaments for points, where the top earners get exclusive cards.
---
No, I think in a way, there should be imbalances.  It's important for every class and spec to be unique in its own way.
---
The impossible endless task of balancing everything just makes everything the same.
---
Thanks I thought so but don't have much vanilla experience outside private servers
---
rogue is 3 buttons but you can get it to 1 button if you dont count scrollwheelup/down
---
This... I just want to play wotlk =/
---
From the interviews I've watched. They don't even know if they will have a hub or a wasteland.
---
Thank god for that.
---
I am going to go mining and engineering as all good nature lovers should.  Nothing quite says "I love nature" like digging holes in it and blowing it up.
---
I can only get so erect. If they go the OSRS route I will go bananas.

Is there something you're basing this assumption off of?

If thats the case I would like to see a Level 30 try to tame Blind Hunter in RFK who is lv 32 just to see if the bat is CC immune like its suppose to be (bugged in Vanilla)

TBC/WOTLK is definitely bleeding into your memory of Vanilla if you think this. Consecrate was not enough to make Paladins into tanks in Vanilla.

"I'm proud of you.  So very proud.  This is great news honey.  When will it be over, though?"

You need to look her in the eye with all intensity and seriousness and deliver this line solemnly without a single smirk.

"When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east.  When the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves. When the Ogrimmar runs red with blood, and I have eight toons in full tier 3.

---
Betas been out 3 weeks, thatsblike saying wow dies 3 weeks after Any raid patch. It's not a fair comparison to say well this private server cleared and 3 weeks I'm were still playing.

Mark trying to grasp a few more moments of fame by being re-posted fifteen times a day.
---
Isn’t he the Firefall guy that ruined the game?
---
LOL And you had The Rake sitting right there below Thunder Bluff.
---
TBC has some cool systems, namely sockets. Nothing says that Classic cant be expanded to include those systems.
---
Additionally, I recall the devs saying they kind of blew it with KJ and maybe Illidan, because back then they didnt really know how to make characters lore relevant outside of being raid bosses. Hindsight is 20/20. Could you imagine what they could make with a Classic mindset, 15 years of successful (and not so successful) iteration, and the assets/systems from TBC/Wrath, as a Classic expansion (so no level cap change) instead of just re-releasing TBC/Wrath?
---
Jaina*
---
He's actually in my stables! Lol
---
And that's a good thing! I would make my future hunter gnome in classic if i could
---
Hi, /u/timetravelhunter
---
Flying mount ruins everything.
---
I wonder if they can make TBC without flying mount.
---
To be fair Vanilla is really casual friendly. Sure you might have to run UBRS 50 times to get your desired items and it might take you 2 months (due to only running once or twice a night) instead of 2 weeks for someone playing alot. However once you've gathered your full pre-raid BiS there is not that much "mandatory" stuff to do outside of raids other than farming for consumables.
---
I bet most people will be able to ding 60 and be full pre raid BiS before BWL is out. There will always be people at all stages of the game looking for groups/raids. It doesn't matter if you're a tier "behind". Thus the lifespan of Vanilla is much greater than retail WoW. 
---
And if you don't have enough time to reliably raid once or twice a week then you can just join a guild as a social and pop in whenever there is a spot availble. It's difficult to keep up a 40-man roster and you will most likely be able to join. Then there is the 20 mans with shorter reset timers that you can run for good items whenever you have the time.
---
Classic WoW is a great game for everyone.
---
because they shut down private servers and there's no way to play the TBC patches legally? same reason people here wanted Classic WoW? to get the feel of Vanilla Warrior for example, except i hated Vanilla Prot Paladin and liked TBC Prot Paladin. i hated Vanilla's pigeon-holed classes. i liked TBC having a different tier set for each spec. sure they weren't all equally competitive in endgame raiding, but they were still viable especially in 10 man content.
---
Oh man I remember going on expeditions for rare pets. I remember back in the day, I grouped up with two other random hunters (we were all level 20) and we ran from org all the way to darkshore to find that rare translucent leopard. It’s so satisfying to finally get them.
---
"Nobody ever swore in Vanilla! Therefore this guy is a fraud! They should have let in every one of the four-plus million Vanilla players instead to be fair to us specifically!"
---
I would prefer a gathering profession (assuming you aren't going Engineering, or blacksmith for PvP).
---
Very long term, herbalism is a long term money maker, and makes tons of sense on a Druid. SOoner or later the number of alts and mains that still need arcanite reapers trickles down lower than number of people mining ore)
---
As a tuaren you pick flowers faster than anyone, and with druid kitty speed, kitty stealth, travel form, sea lion form, and all the normal mount options, you have many options on when and how to herb.
---
Except for devilsaur, skinning doesnt make much more money than vendoring the leather. There is just so much of it. and so few uses. And many servers are going to have the devilsaur mafia in full effect, so you might be hard pressed to ever get any of that yourself.

He was like "you need to be smarter about your choices"

I just started watching streamers because I didn't get in beta and ya, Payo is the most entertaining.
---
Lmao, Jesus I hope this is satire.
---
What are you, nuts?
---
*It's the thought that counts.*
---
Project 1999 so I can appreciate what WoW did for the genre. 
---
Also Warcraft 3.
---
Without context i assumed toxicity but i prefer your positive perspective instead.
---
I don't see this as toxic, I see it as someone about to have a good time role-playing. 😆
---
This post is like retail players talking about classic because they're scared it will kill the game.
---
I recently picked up Diablo 2 with the expansion so I'll be playing that, as my "main" game until August.
---
I'll play several Dota matches a night until I get sick of losing due to idiot carries (I play either hard or semi supports) then hop on D2 for a bit.

Next Humar the Pridelord!!!

Answer:  "This part of EverQuest sucked.  Let's do it better."
---
Mordhau, SQUAD, Private WoW servers
---
I can’t comment on the time commitment, since my warrior alt was only 60 for the last few months of classic. But you’ll sure as hell get a lot of dungeon groups, which means gear.
---
How do you that's not a player with a 12-15y old account?
---
Doesn't fit your narrative?
---
very funny
---
Wouldn’t recommend rogues? Who have arguably the best CC in the game? You absolutely need a rogue in organized PvP
---
Well this is just from my 13 year old memory so you could be right, but I also read conflicting arguments about paladins and Druid both being good 5 man tanks
---
PoE and watching C L A S S I C streams.
---
Sometimes, race/class are easy to match, level and zone could be done if you’re truly dedicated. I’m just saying that method is better than nothing but not totally foolproof. Especially if you’re not watching the stream, which, I’d say a lot of people wanting to avoid streamers won’t be watching.
---
Warcraft 3 is a nice warm up for classic
---
Wait wait wait. so youre telling me that when my screen goes black and i frantically hit esc to bring up the menu and asks if i want to leave the cut scene....people watch those? Digest those? sit on the edge of their seat waiting for more of those?
---
Yikes. Imagine playing for for the plot.
---
Yeah for pvp, those gloves are god tier
---
Fap simulator 2020
---
As far as PC is concerned a little bit of Mordhau and BFV and unfortunately some Black Ops 4 since my buddies play it.
---
That and some random stuff on PS4.
---
This issue is so massively overblown.
---
level 60 outland and northrend.
---
Personally I'd rather play TBC than Vanilla but I'm totally fine with this. Hopefully they will advance to TBC eventually. Heroic dungeons are great. The whole gearing design is great (Reputations, Badges). Raid design is great with a huge variety of difficulties catering to all kinds of players. Even though 40 man raids are more "epic", 25 man raids is a better and more intimate experience in my opinion.
---
Also the introduction of Arenas is what got me into PvP. I've never really enjoyed world pvp where pure numbers usually is the deciding factor if you win or lose.
---
Why everyone who says that "There will be alot of warriors but only few GOOD ones" thinks that they are going to be the good warriors that stands out from the rest of the thousands?
---
This. One of the biggest mistakes was forced progression. Allow people to complete as much of the content they want from one expansion, then choose when to move on.
---
Private server practice
---
&gt;A subreddit's active users are typically like 1% or less of the actual game population.
---
True
---
&gt;The community here is in no way indicative of what it will be like in game
---
Not necessarily true. (or else surveys and sample sizes wouldn't be things.
---
For alliance:  human for PvE (sword skill) and Gnome for PvP (escape artist).
---
For horde:  Orc for PvP (stun resist + blood craze) and Troll for PvE tanking (berserking for early threat lead while tanking) Orc and Troll are really close in terms of DPS because blood fury vs berserking are both pretty good for dps.

Yeah, what a weird hill to die on lol
---
&gt;	Make karazhan a 20m raid situated between aq40 and naxx in difficulty and reward (like zg was to mc and aq20 was to bwl).
---
Naxx already contained the mid-gap content after AQ40. Because it was split into 4 separate wings, and each wing had easy bosses, guilds could gear up while working toward the end-bosses. Even if guilds couldn’t get past the Patchwerk gearcheck, they could still down spider wing, Razuvious, Noth, and Heigan.
---
Yeah that sucks.
---
True. Without the silithus quests it’s just more of a slog in the Plaguelands but not too bad. 
---
Silithus just makes hitting 60 a lot easier.
---
Reducing the dodge chance is the bigger part of weapon skill for dps I think.

Blizzard has stated that things like these are not going to be "fixed," as they are not designing Classic to be a 1:1 recreation of Vanilla. 
---
Prime example of this: they're using a version of the Live/Retail client (complete with new water and lighting effects, FSAA, Battle.net client and twitter integration, etc) and simply modifying it to where it can "understand" 1.12 server data, instead of using an actual 1.12-era client.
---
So while I understand what you're saying (I liked and preferred turning off the death effects too), concerns like this are, undoubtedly, going to fall on deaf ears. Better to direct energy elsewhere... ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
I think blizzard is afraid it won’t last. Which I can understand. However if they do it right. It will last forever. So it is all up to blizzard to not fuck it up.
---
VR games mostly, maybe a bit of total war warhammer 2 on the side.

More good points. Still, I don't think that there are words to adequately convey my primary problem with AoE looting: it felt wrong. Just as resilience did. For all the practical reasons that explain the flaws, the main thing I remember from the winter of 2017 is the way PvP changed felt wrong and false and untrue and (insert more thesaurus words for 'lies' here). It's kind of interesting to think about this because I wonder if my deep brain is doing all the calculations taking the specifics into account and coming to that conclusion and I wonder if I'm just biased and I wonder if I'm just against change.
---
2h fury is actually pretty good if you use a swing timer and know how to slam right.
---
I miss mount lineups. Preferably of the same mount. (Both are great either way)
---
I have a screenshot somewhere of back in BC during Brewfest. Bunch of alliance folks lined up with the kodo mount. Good times.
---
I think the main point is that they could have still achieved the goal of not being forced to pve, in another way that wasn't the resilience stat.  Because honestly, it made the PvP super long, drawn out, and boring.
---
I remember spending days camping the spawn site of the black echeyakee lion , Humar. I had to fight off the other faction doing the same but when I got him, felt great!
---
Just shows general pop not how many on horde or ally

Didn't they sate that for the beta they removed this restriction so they could test those items as well?
---
Finding a 6slotter is nice but finding a traveler's back pack was my happiest moment of leveling 1-60 in TBC. Can't wait to farm all 4 slots in classic :)
---
Pet Battles are kind of close. You collect them out in the world and then you mini-game battle with them or sell them. I'll admit that I never got into it so I can't speak about how fun or unfun it is though.
---
Oh damn its even 3 chars, awesome!
---
I mean it just depends, if you can you want to just quest as normal as it’s the fastest. The issue comes if there’s absolutely no mobs to tag, like on a certain pserver that just got into naxx the launch had like 6x the pop that a layer will have, although dynamic respawns meant everything respawned instantly, but there were so many people literally every mob even up to the level 6-7 mobs outside were camped by 5+ people. The instant respawns meant it was somewhat feasible to level like that but on classic launch respawns will be far slower and the pop will be far smaller. I imagine for classic launch if it’s bad enough to warrant it you should go for exploration, but you may be able to group as 5 to kill higher level mobs outside the starting zone which would likely be faster than exploration and leave you with more gold. Considering layers are only 3k though you’d probably be fine even a few after hours after launch to quest as normal (although there’s still likely going to be a ton of players), but if you want to get in at the start and take off you just have to determine what’s best, likely by looking at the quest mobs and seeing if it’ll be feasible to get tags.
---
Cool your jets.  It doesn't matter that it's a woman.  Saying "getting to fuck me is the best gift ever" is vain no matter who it is.
---
It's slow but you'll still be able to eventually tank raids. Theres usually at least 2 sometimes a 3rd tank in raids. Just means it'll take longer since you wont be primary necessarily but that's alright.
---
Oh my.. This brings memories. Having a low level hunter with a snow leopard pet.
---
Correction: You wont be making everyone else stronger, just the 4 individuals in your group.
---
What about staysafe? Also if dude thought that asmon is meh, then payo wont satisfy him either
---
How dare the opinions of the guy who created the game be posted here.
---
I've been playing Apex, Overwatch and League. Also Retrowow-instant 60 pserver with lots of pvp and all raids are scaled for 5man groups
---
Not sure if its taboo but I stream an ally 30 druid on beta almost every day and its Turleyy (mr_turley) another good druid is lamissa but idk if they stream.
---
Druid can do it. Paladin can't.
---
It's 13-year-old memory for me as well, but since I was a Paladin main in vanilla this would be a pretty huge memory fart on my part if I totally forgot that Paladins were running around tanking 5-mans. I remember crystal clear how amazing we thought the TBC class changes were because they made tanking for Paladins *possible*.
---
He talks about the hoodie for 30 seconds...
---
So true.
---
If you get that weapon with only 12 hrs a day it would be a miracle.
---
I don’t think people realize how hard it is to get to 60. Unless everyone uses an add on that tells you the way I’d be willing to be most casuals will get lost and/or discouraged by the lack of gold to do anything. 
---
I’m sure a small percentage of people will get there quickly but that won’t represent the main population base.
---
Hey man!  I mained a feral druid on ND and took him pretty far, so I'll offer my two cents:
---
* It's a popular move to take enchanting only to produce the trinket and then drop it in favor of some other professions.  Once you've equipped it, you do not need enchanting any longer unless you actually want to use it.
---
* Yes, it's a pain in the ass that you can't use consumes in kitty/bear, but you will actually spend more time than you think in human form.  For example, a common PvP opener is to Pounce your target, Rake him once, burn those combo points on Rip and then pop out of kitty to add a Moonfire.  Druids are the kings of outlasting their opponents, and I can guarantee there will be ample opportunity for you to throw bombs when you desperately need an interrupt and your Feral Charge is on cooldown.  Engineering in general is just extraordinarily useful, even for druids.
---
* Regarding mining/herbalism, it's a little difficult to say just how valuable they will be at the moment since we don't know everything about Black Lotus spawns, but you will always have a supply of customers for Swiftthistle &amp; Fadeleaf and being that consumes are a massive part of Classic, the higher end herbs too.  However, if you wind up farming Dire Maul with a buddy or two, you will want a miner with you to capitalize on the nodes inside.  You won't go wrong with either choice, they're both great moneymakers.
---
Good luck!  I'd suggest hitting up the Druid Discord server as well, there's a goldmine of info there and some really helpful people.
---
If you mean dps then the cooldowns you manage are slower and you can tank 5mans, that's the main difference.
---
I mean you could say the same about every dungeon but BWL as arguably razorgore is a more technical encounter than the next two bosses.
---
THe fact remains the skill jump from Nef and AQ (Huhu and earlier) to Twin Emps and beyond is noticable. Sure, some guilds got Heigan and Noth and maybe even pathwerk down, perhaps anub. But those same guilds were already stuck at twin emps, huhu or cthun. 
---
I dont see the early bosses in a given raid as a "catch up mechanic". I just see them as easy bosses. The first 8 bosses in Siege of Orgrimmar werent catchup for the last 6 bosses, they were jsut easy bosses in the same raid.  Catch up implies it comes out after the content it is meant to catch people up to.

How do you know that person isn’t attracted to you and into kinky stuff? This might be a compliment.
---
I find it hard to take a "fan's" account seriously when they claim that "space goats" "gutt[ed] the entire established game lore." The Draenei were *well*-established long before World of Warcraft came out, and Broken Ones existed in Vanilla to boot. That a contingent managed to escape the shattering of *DRAENOR* (i.e., the planet they gave a name to) on the Exodar is entirely unsurprising. Nothing in TBC, in fact, "gutted" the game lore. It was the inexorable continuation of that lore. Did you not even play the Warcraft RTS games? WoW didn't become "fanfictiony" until WoD at least.
---
I can and do agree on some things, but other stuff like "Homogenization" is silly. WoW wasn't homogenized in TBC. That is, again, a problem that began during/after Cata. Classes were still plenty flavorful; they merely provided proper itemization and balance tweaks for hybrid specs.
---
At any length, I'll say the same thing to you that I say to the people constantly brainstorming about how and when TBC will be reimplemented: *Who cares? Play the actual game when it comes out and stop worrying about stuff that might or might not happen years in the future.*
---
&gt;this "IRL" thing
---
You mean [Outside](https://youtu.be/7h1kDYFMCVA)? I heard they'd had such a long content drought entire classes had started quitting.
---
In between Pally/Priest/ Shaman for healing or rolling a mage. The lack of in-combat mana regen (barr mana stream) on shaman is daunting, but so is fighting mages and warlocks for cloth gear on a priest.
---
Mages look fun as hell and teleporting around sounds like a godsend, but I remember the average wait time for trying to find a group on my hunter in TBC.... Plus they're going to be super overpopulated.
---
Levelling is a non factor, and I'm only going to do the occasional BG.
---
&gt;Classic WoW is a great game for everyone.
---
That's not what I remember.  I remember going into LBRS at like 8pm and not getting out of there until like 11pm or sometimes after.  I remember doing 2-3 hours BRD crawls to get a barman shanker for my rogue.  I remember taking an hour to 2 hours depending to do DM north.  And this when I was already in BWL gear.  And this isn't even getting to the 3+ hour raid nights that were mandatory.
---
For my personally... telling my wife and kid that after daddy gets back from work at 6 and eats dinner and showers, he will be unavailable for all fatherly duties until midnight when you both are probably asleep... and this will happen every Tuesday and Fridays for the forseeable future.  In between, daddy might also be unavailable for love and attention if I am stuck healing for BRD.  Ok, good talk family.  
---
That's not gonna fly lol.
---
I can't click the article cus I'm at work, but if you reserve 3 names before the servers are out... Does that mean there can only be one Asmongold across all of WOW?
---
I've not heard that, though the talent is nice and gives you better options for opening. That's probably more what i do if I was planning on doing lots of instance tanking as I levelled.
---
11 Arms is definitely my preferred first 11 points. Most people will advocate getting improved Overpower first, moving up to Sweeping Strikes and getting the deep wounds/impale line, as this combos well with proccing near guaranteed crits from Overpower, and Sweeping lets you pull 2-3 mobs. But this setup isnt as good for instance tanking early on as 11 arms 7 prot.
---
Note that if you do mix and match a tree as you level, ALWAYS respec for the 1g first respec cost to get the 31 point talent in any tree at level 40. You wont ever beat out the extra kill speed of having access to Mortal Strike or Bloodthirst (or even Shield Slam) at level 40 via a mixed tree build.
---
Correct. They are capable of locking up and killing a single target with a decent time investment, and generally not very impactful in a large group v group setting. Premades will generally bring 1 maximum to either camp a point in stealth in ab, or to sit in flag room on defense. In PUGs their ability to carry a team to a win is very limited.
---
Kind of cool that you can be the tank+healer for instances.  The pally is basically on autofollow and healbot/buffbot.  You can get the paladin to attack in melee just by manouvering the mob with the warrior.  But I believe melee autoattack cancels the /follow command so you'll have to deal with that all the time. 
---
I have a feeling in level 60 content it won't be as optimal.  Especially if stuff hits the fan you'll have trouble keeping everything under control trying to maintain 2 char at once, especially as hte tank and healer.
---
Frost generally speaking, but I'm not a mage player so I can't be more specific.
---
I'm just healing random bg's and talking trash in trade chat, working on my insane title and mount farming.
---
Typical "burnt out on current expansion" stuff.
---
Agreed
---
You need to come up with better names...
---
Adding payo but not pshero?
---
My wife and I originally rolled a dwarf hunters and took turns taming that guy.
---
You cannot possibly fathom our disappointment when we tamed him and he didn't have that knockdown/stun.
---
By 60 we realized double hunter was not the way to get invites to group, so we rerolled.
---
As a warlock player who uses VW to grind.. wisdom on the voidwalker would be great.  Thanks.  It doesn't need to do damage it just needs the mana to cast the torment ability which generates threat.  The VWs go oom quickly and is a huge restriction on how a VW warlock grinds.
---
Looking forward to see you get rekt
---
Gnomes are great for casters and melee because escape artist. Humans have sword/mace spec making them bis for pve melees.
---
That video proves my point. You just linked a video where the majority of it is the person drinking with "100G/hour" thrown into the byline. Go ahead, level a Priest, try it, report back. It wasn't that popular in classic for good reason.
---
What level do you need to get an alt to in order for it to be able to level up alch enough to xmute?
---
What would they gain by prioritizing old accounts? You're already loyal.
---
Here are their priorities (in order):
---
* Marketing
---
* Testing
---
* Being able to say that access is random
---
Perhaps this is not as it should be in a fair world but it is predictable and good business.
---
Stino is fucking awesome
---
I'm sure all the store options will be available at some point. Plenty of people will pay for an appearance change just for a haircut.
---
yeah bro i'm with u, fuck these tryhard streamers ruining the game making servers popular. this is just like back in the day when the most popular player was the server everyone joined. im sick of it, bring back the REAL classic experience
---
Any priest or Druid’s out there for those considering those classes?
---
U mad bro?
---
Was literally gonna leave this exact comment, have my upvote.
---
Even if you're an alliance main , it's nice to experience every starting zone with it's respective capital city.
---
I remember leveling all races up to 10 and visiting their capitals back then and although my main was a human mage at the time it's what got me to enjoy the horde side more ( which is what prompted me to play horde for the last decade ).
---
Double that with the streamers fans transferring over to the new server too.
---
It's 100% a bug.
---
Yes, by the time I'm leveling on classic it'll be my 3rd char to 60, and I have had a lot of alts to the mid levels.
---
A lot of quests I just remember what to do on, but more than anything I want to make sure I pick up all available quests in a zone.
---
So I'll be using one for sure.
---
Yeah I’m still disappointed about the sharding 
---
But as long as they keep it restricted to the starting areas I’ll be happy but if it continues to the major cities I’ll be disappointed because it makes them seem barren of actual players and kills the feeling of seeing all the other players online
---
I also ran it a lot and don't think I ever got close to getting bored of it. 
---
My hunger for raiding back then was insatiable though, I could of raided every night for hours if there was enough content!
---
Yes if you google it you will see that some statement has been made regarding the existance of an RP-PVP server.
---
Consider that warriors are by far the preferred tank, whereas  paladins and druids may or may not spec for tanking at all. Monks and DKs just don’t exist. So even if a faction has 30% warriors, if half of those go prot/are ok at tanking you’re still in a great spot to get groups.
---
I’m just referring to the continuation of this years down the line. Are they going to give players the option to xterm to BC? Or force them and etc.
---
there is wow tcg reborn. they just recently released a new set theme around pandaria.
---
it's only digital afaik though
---
It hasn't been released yet, you can only download it if you've been invited to the beta.
---
Did someone just take a shit in general next thing will be anal...
---
Goldshire Inn hospitality.
---
Yeah, he's yelling, but he's also putting on an act. Soda would rather play alliance than horde.
---
Repeating that cycle might be fun for most people once or twice but not much more than that. A few people would love to do that over and over, sure, but I'd like to see the game flourish instead of stagnate while the playerbase steadily drops.
---
Most people on here are still complaining about streamers having beta access but this guy takes it to the next level and complains about the people they see on stream. Sad.
---
You just described a guide
---
population imbalance, economy, ahn'qiraj mount, spammed chat, toxic players, lots of things are possible
---
I think it depends on what content is out. Earlier on that's just a free overpower, later on you dont want to dump your rage stance dancing to overpower.
---
Glancing blow damage is 40% of your damage so getting that mitigation down is also very valuable
---
You essentially net 2 hit overall from 5 weapon skill, which is the big landmark. Hence having edgemasters covers that for non human/orcs. While it's still better to have it innately and not use an arlor slot on it. I dont think it's going to be as big a set back as it was on pservers, itll definitely still be one
---
I’m glad I’m not the only one! I thought I was going crazy. Doesn’t matter what I load up &lt;30minutes later I’m not interested anymore close it and start going through classic wow again.
---
Cool thnx ; gotta make that fire resist gear.
---
Stellaris and private servers.
---
It's really the exact same as celebrity culture for anything else.
---
Only now, it's gamers who thought they were immune to that kind of  thing who are totally buying into it.
---
No shame sir. If I wasn’t at work I wouldn’t have fought the back.

browse the comment, you'll find different opinions and answers about that, some issues are bigger than others
---
Paladins are fine but were latecomers because the prot tree was garbage until late vanilla.
---
Paladin tanks were one of the best choices for the Strat speedrun in the 0.5 dungeon set 2 line. They were fine, they were just very rare because it WAS impossible to easily tank instances initially.
---
And they're plenty fine, been tanking as paladin with no issues in Beta and there's lots of vids out there of paladins tanking 5mans brilliantly on private servers at 60 (and whilst there are some differences there's nothing 
---
The issue with paladin tanks is they need spelldamage for threat, which means before the advent of the remade 1.12 blue loot, Dire maul, and 0.5 line stuff you kinda needed Tier 2 to do it well. Most people are still learning about protadins because they werent around long enough to fully theorycraft before BC came out.
---
I promise you, protadin tanks are plenty good 5-man tanks. They have some minor disadvantages and some good advantages, same as Druids. Most people thought druids couldnt tank well throughout half of vanilla. i was the first druid on my server to tank ragnaros as a bear, and that was around the time AQ was a month or so away from dropping. It took ages to adopt them because the early bears were so bad, same as early prot.
---
If you recall, release Prot for paladins had BoKings as the top talent and it was more of a utility tree.
---
Clearly you don't understand how stress tests work. You should really think things through before you make a dumbass comment trying to hate on Twitch and streamers.
---
I'm not super confident many people purchasing runs are going to be doing so on the very slim chance that a rare BoE Blue or purple would drop for them and if they are then I would have to assume that player is likely floating in enough gold to purchase the item off the AH regardless.
---
Realisticly I believe you have 1 valid option that will in the end likely increase how lucrative your group is while also promoting a good reputation.
---
1. If you are 3/5ths of the group then on average your trio should win more roll's for BoE's than you lose, thereby increasing your profits at a slower pace but it would also increase your reputation and providing good word of mouth for new customers to look for your group.
---
This of course only works for dungeons that can be run with 5 people, if we get into 10 man Scholomance or 15 man UBRS then that method of handling BoE's would never work and also you technically wouldn't be carrying a group that size either with only 3 people so I would refrain from attempting to sell runs in those places altogehter as a group and potentially just have a fee that would higher yourself to a group needing a tank for those runs as it would be the only way to draw a profit from them.
---
Now if you didn't care about your reputation I could offer you several scumbag methods of nickle and diming your customers until you simply have no one left dumb enough to come to you for help.
---
Really? I see dafran (a streamer) playing it, and there are a fair amount of people in the server? So do I have to wait to the date of 8.29.19?
---
Cyclonian can be easily done with kiting and a healer and/or range DPS to help.  I duo'd Cyclonian as like a level.. 33 I think with a 37 mage friend.  Taunt, hamstring, and mocking blow to keep aggro ping-ponging between us, mage evoc'd and then suicided at one point just to res and run back (GY is pretty close!) while I kept kiting.  Pretty tough fight but very doable given consistent (ab)use of game mechanics
---
Stream Content is always terrible, try to take this as a lesson and occupy your time elsewhere.
---
I mean if your definition of “catch-up” necessities a separate raid, then sure nothing is going to qualify unless it’s a separate raid. But if you take “catch-up” to mean “providing gear to help progress past difficult fights” then Naxx definitely qualifies. It differs from other raids because the wings offer choice. That’s straight from the devs when describing how they designed Naxx.
---
You can’t say the same about BWL because if you can’t kill Vael you can’t get more BWL loot. If you can’t kill Twin Emps you’ve got no other options.
---
I saw something broken down by average time invested in each level and it placed halfway at around 44. Can't find it offhand though so take my comment with a grain of salt.
---
It's well done except there's something about the face. Idk what it is but I creeeeeps me out
---
I did not set anything up for qualifications Blizz did [here](https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/world-of-warcraft/22990080/mark-your-calendars-wow-classic-launch-and-testing-schedule)
---
Read past the test schedule part for criteria for beta invite. *Participants will also need to have an active subscription or active game time on their Battle.net Account*
---
I don't feel more entitled, they write they are inviting based off of it. And I am sorry you will burn out after 3 months on the game. I don't plan on burning out especially after playing for what - 14 years? I really like the game and appreciate it and would like some time to test. Have a good day and glad you got beta without an active sub that blizzard suggests?
---
Anything past 90 is honestly not rewarding...
---
That’s pretty sick
---
Chat is overly spammed with "inv to X's layer", population imbalance (those kinds of event happen on one side so it's cool at the moment but then no one plays on the other side for example and pvp is unbalanced af), economy is influenced, lots of different issues can arise
---
If you have a Paladin offtank in a raid though, ideally they'd be the 30 Holy 21 Prot spec that can heal as well as a regular holydin but also brings BoSanctuary to the raid. 
---
When not tanking, this paladin would be HEALING not dpsing.
---
If you have a healer buddy then go warrior. If you want to mess around solo in wpvp, then do consider hunter as it is so much less frustrating and you will actually be the cause of everyone else’s frustrations.
---
When you say "doesn't seem like a hard fix" what are you basing that on?
---
Are you a programmer with extensive training in game development?
---
Tbh we have absolutely no idea how "easy" anything is to fix, because we don't have the source code and we aren't the ones who are trying to jam a 15 year old game world, into a much altered game engine.
---
I wasnt comparing to OSRS. The skill cap in OSRS is also a lot lower.
---
High ranked PVPers should be the ones consulted on PVP balance. 100 days is far too much I agree but you need to play at a high level to understand if something is not balanced or you are just bad at the game.
---
K. 
---
https://worldofwarcraft.fandom.com/et/wiki/Griefing
---
I think they'll be motivated to do so, going PvE is negating any form of world PvP so it's pretty tough
---
It's an arbitrary halfway point anyways considering experience from kills and quests goes up with you and you become more efficient higher up.
---
27th, but yes, all the people currently playing it are in the beta and that includes a lot of streamers.
---
Yeah, that was all a part of the normal build progression though.  They did introduce some reputation abilities that were pretty powerful with the expansions that added a lot of depth to group builds through the new classes, but in the end a warrior from prophecies wasn't much weaker than a warrior who did all the expansions.
---
All in all I would say GW power creep was managed best by a long shot.
---
I made a simple statement, mafias that are big enough to be effective would be big enough to be obvious. Cross faction collusion is bannable, this is not in question. So you take those two statements and it makes a pretty easy read.
---
Cornering the market is not bannable, if you manage it somehow without colluding without the other faction you are fine. But all of these mafias have been cross faction, and not at all subtle. You can't cover the entire set of spawns 24/7 and keep both faction randos away without it being very clear what is happening.
---
Yep, testing has some time left to it, we haven't even been allowed to level past 30 yet. The date is the 27th btw, unless the 29th is for your country/region, that's possible since I think it's technically out on the 26th on NA
---
so people don't camp their quest spawns or them.
---
How is your version of a catch up any different from any other raid, though? The majority of wow raid teams didnt clear MC on their frist week nor BWL nor any instance. 
---
They depend on farming early bosses to beat the later ones cause their skill cant trump the low ilvl. 
---
Is that a catch up? Or simply progression?
---
Chuck Norris walked down the street with an erection once. 
---
There were no survivors.
---
guilds can include alts... i guess it comes down to /who online or something and seeing the total # of players, but that might be a pserver thing.
---
having options for play during the journey to level cap is super important. developing content that may be trivial to players at the top end of entropy is, as you've detailed ultraimportant for everyone else who isn't and any of those leveling alts while not wanting to repeat their first set of steps.
---
Right now it’s a closed beta. Yes you will need to wait until 8/29/19 to play. 
---
Streamers and other content creators along with some that have had an active account since vanilla got closed beta access. The rest of us will have to wait.
---
During these levels I just run SM constantly. 28-38 I run SM branches a few times the days I play and make pretty good money and have fun during an otherwise rough time zone hopping.
---
I do miss that about doing quests for skills and stuff.
---
The answer will be yes. Go ask Taladril.
---
what? ive never had that problem. stop buying shit on the AH
---
Pretty much every server in the game had &lt;Grand Theft Kodo&gt; and &lt;Naga Stole My Bike&gt;
---
Paladins can tank 5 mans. They're even better than warriors for pack pulls. The main reason they cant tank raids isnt lack of taunt it's that their damage single target is low and the cant generate good threat without going oom. For long raid fights this is a problem but for short 5 man fights this is fine
---
Haha that's funny. Just rolled a hunter this morning since my pally hit 30 yesterday and I heard auto attack was fixed. Decided to see if that was true and thankfully it is
---
Dirge
---
Shit that’s amazing. And the perfect “shit I need to attend to life”-button.
---
I understand, I was in one of those guilds pushing for progression in AQ40 and Naxx. It's easy to dismiss us as just being bad and ignorant back then, but I think the truth of the matter has a lot more to do with the fact that we were figuring out the fights as we went and didn't have 15 years of knowledge to fall back on. Sure, patchwerk seems easy now but he sure didn't the first few times we engaged and immediately watched DPS drop like flies. Thaddius wasn't even possible at most times of the day because of server lag; my guild ended up waiting until something like 4am PST to attempt him when no one else was in Naxx because it was the only way to get the kill. There were a lot of strange peculiarities back then that raiders don't really deal with anymore. Never the less, it was those progression guilds that earned the knowledge almost every guild since has leveraged for clears.
---
Ret paladin is fine, but you should consider reck paladin.  Offensive reck is 0/25/26, and defensive reck is 26/25/0.  Reck bombs are INSANELY powerful and fun to use but takes some skill to use properly.  Also a much better spec to support allies because you have multiple boosts from talent points to help out such as BoK, shorter HOJ cooldown, 100% damage pushback resistant heals (as defensive reck spec), and a guaranteed crit every 2 minutes (as defensive) for huge holy lights.
---
HOW DARE YOU SIR!
---
Act or not.  It's annoying and obnoxious...unless maybe you're a teenager.
---
Thanks for the info! I think the mount benefit alone outweighs the mage food and drink bonus. Plus banishing in raids along with their soulstone and healthstone. I’ll do lock
---
Thanks for the links, very interesting to listen to.
---
It's half way in terms of experience, but not time. You get more exp from quests and mobs at a higher level.
---
bassicly just a macro to /follow "warrior name", i would assume you could even do that on the forward button for the main guy
---
OP: I want to avoid streamers
---
Also OP: I want to spend multiple nights doing nothing but the exact opposite of avoiding streamers
---
Good to know! Thanks
---
What made Vanilla fun was the preparation and planning, not the execution. Being the top DPS meant knowing what loot to farm, what consumables to farm, what spec to use, what gear to use, etc. and then executing that plan before/during the raid. It’s more of a cRPG than an aRPG.
---
I will!
---
To this day, it's still one of my favorite sights in WoW.
---
My unoriginal thoughts are very important!
---
To each their own I guess. I guess you just sip tea with your friends while watching downtown abbey and never talking shit.
---
If they wanted to speak english, they would have chosen an english speaking server, ergo they chose not to. 
---
For someone who doesn't speak english to choose a french server and then try to have them speak english to them is just...annoying.
---
If you want to infer offence and get offended that is your own prerogative.
---

Just wanted to come back after the latest blue posts regarding damage dealt to and by mobs and say, I told ya so lmao.
---
Welp! That would be bad for the kids!
---
No! Mon/max only! Only gnome mages! ^/s
---
As user BigAngryPolarBear once said:
---
&gt; Gtfo
---
You must be a terrible person, then. 
---
TBC Druid was broken and indefensible. It was fucking unholy and should never be realized again.
---
&gt; the problem is you just assume that will be TBC. 
---
Well no, I'm proposing that Naxx will be followed by slightly altered  WotLK-content
---
Or have her join me?
---
I'm working on my backlog (that just got bigger again, *thank you*, GOG Summer Sale...), so Thief, Darksiders, Elex, Dying Light (again), and probably Blood on that front. Then PoE has a new season starting, which I'll be investing some time in, and apart from that, I am in dire need of leveling up my guitar skills.
---
I'm really not hurting for things to play and do until Classic hits.
---
I'm loving my beta access on my 15 year old account. Perfectly aged
---
I hear you 
---
I guess it depends on the success etc 
---
I wouldn’t mind playing BC as well because I played it briefly but never got to experience WoTLK which I heard us the best expansion to be released to those that played it
---
I hope they fix it, bugs like this make me quiver
---
He's relatively washed up and many things he says has been said elsewhere
---
I agree, with the sockets being especially unique. They allowed you in a sense customize your gear stat wise that much further, while also bringing a new profession to the table. Like most of us TBC fans are agreeing upon, take flying mounts, perhaps dailies, maybe figure out a different way to work around resilience on pvp gear, would be tits. I loved the raiding and pvp gear so much aesthetically and the viability of multiple specs for each class. Those damn flying mounts and dungeon finder... I was always pretty okay with summing stone though.  It was a nice QOL, yet you still required people to travel to the instance putting them into the open world for interaction, etc. In the same boat, people will say it negated the uniqueness of the warlocks summon... all in all TBC was superior in many aspects I would love to have integrated into classic or classic extended  to TBC some time in the future, in the spirit of classic.
---
It's a biased sample. You typically want as varied of a sample as possible. People who frequent a subreddit far before a game launch (especially of a "remastered" game) will have a larger base knowledge of the game. I totally get what you're saying, but this subreddit as a whole is a non indicative sample of the entire playerbase.
---
While it's a useful test, it's not helpful for vanilla. 300 skill was the cap and it definitely took 20ish mins just melee-ing mobs in the blasted lands (the ones that go immune to damage at low health so you only need 1) to go from 250-300.
---
Skipping your therapy in my cou try will nullify the check and you will get nothing. You don't get shit, unless you do what you need to do, such as go to therapy and work on your actual issues.
---
WoTLK was good for the most amount of people. I went downhill after lfg came out imo. But Ill be down to play it all over again.
---
We really hope for rp-pvp, but in case it won't happen...welll pvp or rp. It's hard call. On retail we played on rp server since vanilla. This time we will probably go to pvp server i think and we will rp there anyway.
---
It took you 24 hours to get to level 10 and 7?
---
I think this is the one!
---
But that makes sense.
---
Could argue it victimizes my eyes for having to see it so much...
---
They will keep the information secret as long as possible. Why would they stream what server theyre going on if they want to avoid trolls? If they say which server theyre going its a lie to convince others to go on a server they dont plan on playing. They literally discussed everything they could do to avoid crowds forming around them on launch so they can get out of starter zones. https://www.twitch.tv/videos/431639354 starts at about 6:49 this isnt the first time theyve mentioned how to avoid this situation.
---
Then just wait a day or two for their server to be found out.
---
I've been playing Diablo 3 StarCraft 2 and rift to keep myself entertained until classic. Sadly it's not working! My buddy and I are bored stiff and rift is not as good of a game as it once was. So we know your pain
---
Wranglers on my booty
---
Lol avoid warlocks for nuking is this a joke?
---
This will be me at lv 18 or whatever echeyakee is. I’ll be a nelf. But I must have my Porcelain back.
---
I always loved thunderbluff.     
---
There is the AH, forge, anvil, mailbox, bank, and vendors all in one spot.
---
Nobody mentionning the most classic of those? Precisely related? Often heard this one:
---
Chuck Norris has finished World of Warcraft. Twice.
---
You know how I can tell that you let other people do your thinking for you?
---
When I leveled a hunter, I spent more time playing around capturing unique hunter pets than anything else. I raided some on it, but that's the part I remember the best is being proud of the rare ones I got and the time it took to track down and find them.
---
Min/maxing is fun for people, idk why that’s hard to understand
---
No one, not even old vanilla players give a damn about your sense of entitlement...you are not special and will not receive special treatment.
---
&gt;  Being able to apply your own stones is important. 
---
You talking about weightstones? I know they made a big difference on P.servers but my understanding is that that was a bug. I don't expect them to see use on Classic.
---
I have an account old enough to have been in the first beta, so I get a say as well and I want TBC and WoTLK servers. Blizzard will listen to the community and gauge it by overall success. If this does as well as it appears we can expect TBC to start development in about a year I would say.
---
From what I understand, this is the reason many people wanted Classic. Some people want to play Vanilla for the rest of their lives.
---
My theory for a very long time now has been that there is a non-trivial amount of Classic players/advocates, including myself, who want Classic so badly because it gives us a chance of playing TBC/Wrath again.
---
Wrath was the most fun I've ever had in WoW. When I played Nost back in 2015 for the first time, I knew I wanted it back. After the shutdown and the hope that was sparked, I signed that petition to Mike Morhaime. I wanted pre-Cata WoW back, in whatever form. If I could get that, I could maybe, just maybe, get the WoW I really wanted.
---
Now that Classic is a thing, and they said they'd be willing to discuss post-Naxx content and maybe do TBC/Wrath servers, I want that. I want it as badly as I wanted Classic back in 2015. 
---
**I want you, however, should you desire to play Vanilla until your bones turn to dust, to be able to as well.** That's why I'm hesitant to ask directly for Vanilla, TBC, and Wrath Servers. This cuts into all of the populations of WoW, changing a lot for them because the community is so important. Also, there will never be an end to "What next?" if we just progress onwards through the expansions.
---
If you want to play 1.12, no changes, until the end of time, there's no compatibility whatsoever in any development from the Classic Team ever. They need to leave the servers on and walk away. As much as I want people to play what they want, I can't support that. The best I can do is post-Naxx content. Give me something that feels like Wrath and you get something that feels like Vanilla. No new continents, no new levels (Vanilla), tough leveling, no flying mounts, and more. Death Knights (maybe), Horde Paladins and Alliance Shamans, updated class balance, more raids (Wrath).
---
This is a rather premature discussion, as we don't know what the Classic community is going to be like or how exactly everyone will feel once we run into the end of Naxx. However, I know what I want, just like people who only want to play Vanilla know what they want. I'd like to find a middle ground is the difference.
---
Little bit of the battle from last nights Tarren Mill x Southshore war in the beta!
---
Warlock for there is no downside for playing one
---
Don’t fuckin tell me what to do bro.
---
In Wotlk I played on shattered hand eu, which as it turned out (I played there because of an IRL friend) was an unofficial swedish server. I am swedish, so it was okay, but I can imagine the frustration for anyone else.
---
I also randomly picked a server for an alt in vanilla or tbc that very quickly turned out to be a similar situation for Russians (or maybe it was some other country, can't remember).
---
Anyway, it totally happened back then.
---
You know how I can tell you don't know any of the rules for /r/classicwow ?
---
I miss so much about Vanilla though I had a friend remind me the other day of something I completely forgot.
---
AQ20 dropping skill books that gave an extra higher rank of skills that couldn't be purchased, I 100% forgot about that little detail until I was reminded about it and then I had that NAM flachback moment where I waited months for my warrior skillbooks to drop.
---
\*sigh\* good awful so so awful and great times.\*
---
This makes sense to me, actually. Thanks for the explanation.
---
Though I certainly won't trust a Paladin tank in a pub group trying to do an instance while leveing. ;)
---
Fun? whats that
---
sorry I've been playing retail for to long
---
tanking as a warrior is HARD compared to things like current retail. You wont know the good warriors until you group with them but in vanilla there's a WORLD of difference betwen a good warrior and a bad one.
---
Its that second part im not sold on. Is it bannable? I know it was in the 2012 TOS. Buts its not there now.
---
During the beta announcement interviews someone asked a question about cross faction collusion blizzard said its a different world today, they wont facilitate it by allowing easy cross faction ingame friend requests. But IIRC they seemed pretty laissez faire about the entire thing, pointing out themselves that much of it will occur on 3rd party programs they have no oversight of.
---
SM/ruin is definitely a nuke spec lol and it’s one of the best pvp
---
A fair point.
---
Yeah I have a friend that I play D&amp;D with that cant understand that
---
https://www.wowhead.com/bluetracker?topic=185675&amp;region=us
---
Here ya go, enjoy.
---
Engineering is mandatory if you are optimizing. Shifting out, sapper charge, and shifting back in can be done on Classic as part of your standard Powershift rotation (from what we've seen so far, subject to change). 
---
Enchanting is mandatory for the trinket as you mentioned, but just FYI once you have it crafted you can drop enchanting for something else if you so choose.
---
This was never a thing in classic...
---
It’s not. I will (if I get to 60 without burning out) be grinding BiS gear and all consumables. It’s more the sheer amount of ‘should I go x or y’ threads being posted. Maybe someone should make a mega thread for all the guides people have made for classes.
---
Upvote for Stellaris :)
---
I'm more of an EU4 player (almost 2k hours), but I'll hop on Stellaris sometimes.
---
I've always, wanted to get into it, but I'm just not as hooked as I am with EU4. Even Imperator is kinda meh and I'm a big fan of that time period.
---
Sorry sir won’t happen again
---
Part of having fun for some is min maxing.  Dont lecture people on how to play.
---
45-50 is easy, you have the Hinterlands quests and Elite Troll quests. You also have all the easy Thorium Point quests in Searing Gorge. You can also do the ZF quests as well.
---
I understand. My point is my leveling plan is optimized for solo leveling as a warrior and part of that plan includes setting yourself up for success without the NEED for others (of course I’ll take the help when and if I can get it) but at level 36 my leveling path puts me in a good spot to get the final mats, with the potions to solo him without anyone else (and it does require hamstring kiting). 
---
He’s actually easier on classic than on pservers because pservers have a bug where he can spawn between levels 40 and 43 as an elite  - whereas on classic he is always a 40 elite. 
---
Even still - you’ll need a nature resist pot and HS kiting to do it.  My path just takes this into consideration and optimized for that.
---
5% extra dps is a lot and topping dps meters are fun.
---
Yes but you get more xp per hour/quest as you level up.
---
So getting half the total xp to level 60 means you're significantly over halfway in terms of remaining time.
---
Nothing to see here. Just an orc with his giant fudge pop trying to cool off from the Southern Kalimdorian heat.
---
hell yeah i prefer them to short fat bearded scotsmen. LOL
---
This was also a bug on certain pservers. Needs to be fixed asap
---
For the Horde!
---
I did something similar but for the pink plainstrider from the Tauren starter zone. Had to wait on the spawn for a while and also had to kite some warriors who wanted to be dicks.
---
I see. So they pretty much take over the server and it becomes "the streamers server" in a way. Gotcha.
---
Basically.  And for the small donation of $5 they will answer a question poorly and pretend to be your friend.
---
It's probably a per server basis. The wording is a bit iffy and I understand why some people may think it's purely names and not realms, but all it really says is that realm names aren't available until closer to launch, not that the realm names won't be available by Aug 13th when you can reserve your names. Likely, it will be unique names PER server.
---
The idea of course was to have a silly long elaborate story about drinking wine but spitting it out because I lolled. Guess it wooshed. Cant win em all ;)
---
Nah there will still be mafia. There is alot of handwaving in your argument. 
---
A limited resource that so many ppl need and is easy ro control and corner can be much more profitable than farming instances.
---
Imagine caring about someone else's leveling speed
---
So why is this a "told ya so lmao" to me?
---
&gt; and never talk shit
---
What? I'm literally talking shit about Soda right now lol.  Is it only shit talking if I'm screaming like a dumbass mongoloid to appease a fanbase full of children?
---
Id ditch the shield nodes for the mana ones and grab the two hander node as using twohanders increases damage quite a bit
---
I tried getting back into it last year but it was just missing ... something. I think the community will have a big part to play in making classic good/disappointing
---
it's fun for some not fun for others. How about you just don't do it if you don't want to?
---
Anybody remember that 2 attack power upgrade?
---
Really has nothing to do with character fantasy. Just the simple fact of mitigation provided by the shield. If main tanks can take without a shield on private servers I think something is way off with the numbers. I understand increasing the threat cap allows bosses to die faster. But Fury Warrior should be taking way more damage than they are on private servers.
---
From what I understand they removed the specific language about cross faction collusion in favor of a more vague language about "Affecting other's gameplay" that they could twist to mean anything they want but it is still bannable. 
---
However you may be right, I would have to see what they said about it and would be glad to see the video if you find it.
---
Thank you for this, understand where you are coming from. What does the "c" and "a" represent?
---
ive always been a horde dude but I love gnomes ever so much....
---
The thing that gets me is when streamers try to give their audience cute little nicknames. 
---
We see you dude, we know this game of manipulation.
---
Well, I guess we do. Their audience doesn't.
---
&gt; It’s not.
---
It is as I have fun doing it, that is 100% proof of  at least person, just because you 1 person the only person you have proof for dose not, does not mean it everyone.
---
1 person is all we need to qualify that people find it fun, you need EVERYONE to say something is the inverse. Ie it is subjective and you cannot make a 100% assertion that it is not fun for people.
---
My bad fam, I meant to reply to that other dudes one, I thought you were the same guy. It's a told ya so to him, cause he was bitching about damage tables and shit and saying blizzard changed it to appeal to more casual players
---
Kala, ex hots player with vanilla and pserver knowledge on Shadowpriest. Really chill guy.
---
Pshero if you want a rogue that hates himself and speaks in broken English.
---
Snutzy if you want a budget Amaz that plays warlock.
---
I was leaning more towards using a shield/fast dagger with flametongue on it. But come 30 I may just want to use windfury and a 2 hander, so that's not a bad suggestion.
---
What of it? I took my time and enjoyed the journey. Not to mention there were so many people around it took awhile to get mobs and such.
---
No! Everyone playing classic will absolutely be a no-lifer and will be min/maxing! You think WoW classic is about fun and enjoying the experience? HAHAHA. If you aren't 60 within the first week and raiding by week 2, you will never ever ever get into a raid. 
---
But in all seriousness, I started leveling a mage to pair with my warrior. Been playing warrior for many moons and on several servers. 
---
Mage offers 2 great pairing benefits:
---
1. Very fast leveling, and free water/food along the way to avoid spending that gold.
---
2. AoE farming. Almost invaluable to a warrior main. Being able to grind cloth/greens/raw gold from mobs so quickly makes the slog through gear/skill dependency so much better.
---
You can also sell portals for some extra gold, but main income will definitely be AoE farming. Paired with Alch/Herb, you can even make consumables for your warrior, alleviating even more stress.
---
That Temple of the Moon music tho
---
beta bro
---
I think we can all agree that this is the most accurate map of UC:
---
[http://www.anypuzzle.com/puzzles/picture/Mazes/Circular%20maze.pdf](http://www.anypuzzle.com/puzzles/picture/Mazes/Circular%20maze.pdf).
---
you copied what i wrote, so you agree with me.
---
A couple of things come to mind.
---
Firstly, the joy of classic is that there's no race involved. The journey is the fun part. If you enjoy dropping totems, drop every totem you can.
---
Secondly, how do you plan on killing mobs as you level? Because if memory serves you only have one DPS totem, right? Your shocks will be slower with this build, your mana will be non existent, and your melee attacks will hit like noodles. You'll be entirely a caster until level 40, but have no talents that increase your spell damage.

My favorite thing about Feral was being our guild's go-to Off-Tank. It was such a fun niche, tanking adds or extra mobs then switching to cat and busting out some powershifting DPS that could still be competitive. Also being a gimmick tank for Tidewalker in SSC because of the high dodge and armor. I was our raid leader, so it was the perfect role for me to play while keeping the raid callouts going.
---
I would do the same for my belf hunter but I would sneak my ass all the way to bloodmyst isles to get that dope ass green ravager
---
Two things. This isn't a big issue like you actually think... And secondly i doubt most streamers are gonna announce what server they are on at the start, people would use the list to track down the streamers and gank them. It would be used for more evil than good.
---
A man of taste. This was my pet for years.
---
I'm following [advice in here](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bts84u/your_last_3_months_what_to_do_with_the_final_90/) and deep cleaning my house so I'll be fine with just a quick dusting for quite a while after launch.
---
I'm telling you this based on what the devilsaur farmers themselves are telling me.
---
Maybe I'm handwaving, but what I said in my post are things I've been told straight from the source.
---
So many "LOL" moments with shadowmeld
---
Running from someone, go behind a tree and shadowmeld and watch them jump around looking for you
---
Shadowmeld from elevated position by a choke point (as a hunter) and pop out at the perfect time to unleash big combos on people. 
---
Noggenfogger (or other shrinky-type of consume) plus shadowmeld, reappear within a bush or some tiny crap like that and be invisible.  Especially as a hunter or spriest when your ranged attacks have very little 'travel' animation so its hard to see where its coming from.  
---
I lost count of how many times I would shadowmeld while I was eating or otherwise AFK for a brief moment and watch hostile horde or random mobs path by me (thus saved from my own Derp)
---
It's a great skill and will save your life multiple times
---
Hey thanks for the tip!  I was not a vanilla player (started in bc) but I’ve been on a pserver for about a year and nobody has told me this.  Makes sense and I will wisdom them in the future!
---
I think that was the thing I was most disappointed about with each expansion. When BC released every moved to Shatt, with WoLK everone moved to Dalaran and so on. Which wasn't bad because everyone would hang out and do things together, it was the hub. But you still had to go to IF, SW, UC, and ORG. It was so hard to want to play when everyone was in the next "hub" and you were walking the lonely echoed Halls of capitol cities left behind. 
---
I can't wait for classic!
---
Quest givers do quests for Chuck Norris.
---
Erm?? I was saying it’s not hard to understand and proceeded to explain how I’ll be BiS grinding? Such knee jerk in this subreddit!
---
Best tip I can give you... don’t leave the superior faction.
---
I meant talking shit with your friends. You're telling me you never raise your voice while hanging out with your friends? I bet you do!
---
Hilarious misrepresentation of what he is saying. I think it's obvious he's talking about in-game play, not whispers and twitch messages.
---
Absolutely disgusting. Take your internet point and get out of my sight.
---
Classic RPG — western games like Baldur’s Gate or Dragon Age: Origins
---
Action RPG — hack-n-slash style games like Diablo or Dragon Age: Inquisition
---
The problem for me comes not from the 1 to 60 grind, which is my favourite part of the game, but from the level 60 part. Like if I'm applying for a raiding guild and they're like, "Oh, you picked night elf, sorry, they're 0.001% worse than humans, so no tanking spot for you."
---
I don't min max because it's what I want, I do it because failing to do so limits my options.
---
Pretty sure colluding with the opposite faction in order to exploit the economy is against the TOS in some general catch-all term so that Blizz can stop stuff like this. I don't have the exact quote but I think it's fairly common knowledge that Blizz wouldn't allow something like a cross faction mafia to monopolize a zone/resource.
---
Lol, cdew is one of the best pvp healers in the game, his following isn't due to luck/timing. He's been around WoW streaming since its inception basically and has always been a household name in PvP. And if you think it was that easy to become a popular streamer making tons of money then prepare to sit at the bottom of a game section with 1 viewer in an abyss that barely anyone gets out of. The reason people like Cdew have viewers is because outside of streaming he put in the work to be a multirank1 gladiator and blizzcon champ and not just simply have "charisma".
---
Unintentional trailer park boys reference?  Or not.  I love it either way.  
---
Spec 31/5/15, get two birds stoned at once
---
Yeah I will try to. As distasteful as they are, I think negative social interactions are crucial to a lively social mmo. There has to be a space for hated people. Griefing, camping, cartels, ninjas...Or the good people mean nothing, if everyone is nice, no one is. 
---
When there are shitty people in the game it makes all the positive interactions that much more impactful, meaningful, long lasting and positive.
---
lol I said I do enjoy it? I was saying it’s not hard to understand since he was taking a jab at my ability to understand the concept
---
Did you remember to train your weaponskills in UC tho?
---
Honestly I got such deep voice and its so hard to enciate,  I think some people think i'm guy and some a girl which makes it great don't want gender to get in the way.
---
No interest in nickle and diming anyone, just as I remember last time I was back to backing dungeons for people all day and then I had to add an early morning farming session each 5-7am to be able to afford to play. If I can offset my costs and maybe put a couple copper in my pocket that would be ideal.
---
If you think totems are the bread and butter when leveling a shaman then I don’t know what to tell you.
---
Good for you man. Family goes first. 
---
I have those old memories of everything taking much more time aswell. However when I started playing private servers I realized most of that is because people seriously had no clue what they were doing back then. Everyone is much more knowledgable and many have 10+ years of experience playing MMO's wheras back then WoW was the first for most people (Except for the small click that came straight from Everquest and Dark Age of Camelot). 
---
I've been doing loads of
---
Do it then! Plenty of great people on both factions I’ve had the pleasure to spend a decent amount of time on both.
---
wrong on all points. 
---
Vanillawowdb is the database leak from TBC that all private servers base their boss information on. Nost's boss armor and other calculations in particular were identical to it, according to threads on Nost's own forums, so we know that this pserver at least did not buff boss armor as you claim. Classicdb is just a wowhead clone, nothing to do with the codebase or database.
---
If it took longer to finish the war effort than to get the scepter, each server would have had many more Scarab Lords. I don't think you can even start the Scepter when the War Effort first starts. Could be wrong.
---
I had a Dwarf Hunter named Thorngon of &lt;The Long beards&gt; on this server! Ahhh fun times.
---
I remember doing ~51/52-60 in a week. My friends thought it was ridiculous. Idk how I did it, but it wasn't difficult.
---
This is one of the things that made me love WoW.  Came from Everquest, where you either paid for buffs or stood around waiting for someone to do a mass group buff.  First time running around Teldrasil a random person running by did something to me, which I realized was a buff.  Thought it was the coolest thing ever!
---
I am reeeeeeally optimistic from what I’ve seen on some threads that many people won’t be like that.
---
You cant tell me what to do, ill do as i please, thank you very much
---
And if you just take a shot in the dark you're strangely wrong like 75% of the time. Same effect when you want to find the repair woman running up the ramp from the bank and you realize you just took the longest path possible to get to her...every time.
---
Nice! Hunter prize pets are what it's all about. I'm on the fence about TBC but if it does come I'll definitively take the hike up to silvermoon for a dragonhawk.
---
Not true. Paladin Flash of Light is the most efficient heal in the game and it's on a 1.5 sec cast time. They tend to just spam that one spell on the tank. HoTs should also be rolling on the tanks on any boss where back-to-back crits would lead to a dead tank, which may or may not tick between those attacks. 
---
Horde healers have it a bit tougher but that's true even without parry haste. Horde doesn't have a tank heal with a cast time lower than 2.5 seconds - which happens to be the normal swing time of a boss.
---
Esfand is a really good genuine streamer, he likes to joke around and can explain game mechanics very very clearly to anyone.
---
Guzu great rogue funny guy.
---
I recently I found Radee, smaller streamer really chill guy.
---
That is actually incredibly orthodox. Except for wanting to start resto you'd be going the theoretical best leveling build.
---
Okey dokey
---
IT was strictly bannable in the 2012 TOS. it would probably fall under a more broad category today of not adversely affecting others experiences. However, in the beta announcement interviews, a dev (I think it was Ion) said they were gonna be hands off on cross faction collusion outside of not allowing in game friend requesting to the opposite faction...you have to get the bnet id and add through bnet launcher. 
---
Ill try to find the link later today when i get from from work.
---
&gt; **Introduced different difficulty tiers** 
---
This is not bad in the slightest, especially for dungeons. It only became an issue when there were suddenly 4 different difficulties of the same raid with only the easiest and the hardest having any differences in mechanics. 
---
&gt; **More gear verticality** 
---
This I agree with
---
&gt; **PvP stats** 
---
PVP Gear progression is good
---
&gt; **Arenas** 
---
Nowhere near bad. 
---
&gt; **Storyline got weird** 
---
Completely ignoring the fact that the story of Warcraft has ALWAYS been weird
---
&gt; **Flying** 
---
I do not care either way
---
&gt; **Homogenization** 
---
You do not know anything about BC class design
---
&gt; **Map design** 
---
Your points are relatively pointless once everyone is at level cap - just like at level 60. Not to mention they DIDN'T keep that "setup" going forward as they designed future leveling paths with that funneling in mind. 
---
I am not in favor of BC over brand new Classic content but you are definitely not winning people over with a half-baked splurge of words that you have no idea the meaning of.
---
If blizzard was smart they would force the streamers to announce early what server they are going to play on. I think there are a lot of people like me out there who will not sign up for the early name reservation because we are waiting to see what server the streamers actually end up on, so we can pick a different one.
---
&gt; I own a house and have a baby on the way, I've actually decided I probably won't ever raid again which is sad.
---
You and many others that played in vanilla (not me, still unmarried and child-free), so I'd bet there will be a number of guilds popping up that are built around people like you. Show up on time, ready to go, know the fights, don't dick around too much, because we're adults now and respect everyone's time.
---
Shamans are pretty good vs locks
---
I'm not sure but I think Spriest aren't bad vs them either
---
I can only talk about the most populous pservers (against the rules here to mention them I believe) but the bosses on all those servers had boss specific armor values identical to the TBC-era database leak. The 'buffed armor' idea was not widespread and didn't appear on any Blizzlike servers I know of.
---
I've had great success with high shadow resistance on my resto Druid.  If they don't have a Felhunter it's not too bad of a fight and you can always bail if things so south.
---
Can you make it so it automatically tracks newly picked up quests, or track quests by proximity?
---
I immediately thought that it sounded off that he tamed something over his own level as well.
---
"Play the game to have fun!" Good advice. Ill be sure to minmax then, as thats how i have the most fun, thanks for enlightening me.
---
Where’s the lecture? Just saying the ridiculous amount of posts asking about it is bonkers. One thread about the + and - of any race for each class would be enough.
---
Isn't it Alt+F4?
---
This is incorrect. Blizzard has never recognized repetitive ganking/corpse camping as harassment. Unless the offending players were using exploits, they will never get banned for those actions.
---
Looks like in Hogwarts duels . Lul
---
Next time take a boat instead of going through the ocean. Much faster.
---
Imagine being feared and not using WotF or going for the warrior instead of the priest casting in from of him, very vanilla and very cool.
---
I’ve played Horde since the beginning. I love it. But the release of classic is going to be a pretty fresh experience for me. I started in BC, so I’m very excited to play classic. Decided it’s time to change it up and make it an entire new game for me. New faction, new class.
---
holy paladin.  you simply starve them (the player, irl) to death
---
From the beta, it's really hard to tell, hunter at level 30 is the strongest pvp and pve class and the hunter metagame at level 30 and 60 is really different.
---
I'll still suggest [https://www.twitch.tv/themechanic98](https://www.twitch.tv/themechanic98) because he likes to kite mobs to fun place, like i always did in retail and he looks like a decent player.
---
Otherwise, it's really hard to know for sure the level of streamers in pve and pvp, Pve rotation and pet management can be really tricky to master at 60. And managing the deadzone when the others classes have way more spells in pvp isn't an easy task either.
---
If that's what you think, then I feel bad for you. Poor soul.
---
Blizzard could re-release fresh vanilla servers for the next 20 years and people would play them.
---
but but for the horde!
---
Handsdown, Esfand or Tipsout
---
That may have been more true in 1.10 or whatever but in 1.12 shield slam was a threat monster, dealing high damage and also having high base threat, almost as much as sunder armor.  The damage it could deal with a decent shield and decent gear easily puts it over sunder in terms of threat per rage.
---
Sure I raise my voice.  Do I yell about "retards" and autism?  No.
---
And other things get posted here 20+ times a day. This is a social forum and people are allowed to say what they think. If anything YOU are the one that needs to head on out because no one wants to see someone complaining about people.
---
Devilsaur spawn time likely longer on p server. Layering isnt supposed to happen by the time ppl are faroming devilsaur. They held devilsaur against ppl arund the world, not just chinese. They kept the price high with players w good ping trying to contest. The chinese are just infamous for buying gold so they less likely to mind paying 400 g for a set. I was a part of these mafia, and not many of those ppl were very smart. I wouldnt take their word as gospel. Sure it will be toned down on classic. But tgere will be groups of playera banding together to cobtrol spawns and the biggest group will likely take over and get control and make lots of gold.
---
Taurens don’t have increased herb gathering speed in Classic so they shouldn’t pick anything faster than anyone.
---
Since OP isnt in the beta atm.
---
https://www.twitch.tv/joana
---
You could ask Joana. Hes a Hunter main and reporting bugs avidly unlinke many other streamers.
---
Attunements can help, require an item off the final boss.. Or like Rag put 1 peice from the next tier on the final boss. Gives you a reason to go back.
---
It doesn't... yet
---
Wtf is 4head
---
Credits of the comic goes to [Huffy Penguin](https://huffy-penguin.tumblr.com/post/154613639002/cookies-are-too-awesome-to-keep-just-for-ourselves). It's all the way back from 2016, but it always been one of my favorites.
---
In fact they over-accentuate the cookie cutter for the horde side too. Org is so fucking barren, where the fuck do they get their food from? Is there a freaking garden anywhere? I can't stand org
---
Actually 92 is half of 99
---
I made similar gold killing loch modan mobs for green boe drops. I was in a group but I won like 50% of the rolls and most sold for 2-4 gold
---
SL warlock isn't really that scary outside of a duel where they can chose the right pet to setup and you can't run away.  
---
In any bg or open world pvp most classes can literally just run away from them. They have low dps and control.
---
&gt;it would probably fall under a more broad category today of not adversely affecting others experiences.
---
This is the bigger issue. A cross faction 24/7 monopoly on a resource would adversely affect other players experiences and I think blizz would step in. Even if it's not cross faction, just the horde holding that zone and griefing every single person 24/7 would be enough for Blizz. 
---
Now if it's a smaller operation and they are only really controlling it for like 5 peak hours per day then I don't think blizz would step in. It would all depend on how effective they were. If you have to just come back some other time they're not active then Blizz would prefer that, but if they have a 24/7 cycle of people on duty it would be an issue.
---
It's wild to have devs who play alliance again.
---
I agree.  The 30s weren't bad, because STV was such a great hub for questing (ganking notwithstanding).
---
The 40s are where my alts always died.  It was a weird no-joy zone where you had no clear short-term goal to keep you going.  The 20's kept me focused on getting to STV and Scarlet Monastery, the 30's kept me focused on getting my mount and 31 pt talent at 40...but the 40s gave me nothing in the near-term.  50 is where enthusiasm would pick back up, since 60 was finally on the horizon.
---
Well in Soda's defence he wasn't streaming here.
---
Locks just outlast mages in vanilla. Assuming equal gear and skill locks beat mages in a 1v1 . Curse of tongues alone is devastating .
---
Hey, could you release sourcecode? I’m curious how it works :) Cool little addon.
---
I agree, having enemies in a game like this adds something that you otherwise would miss. I just have issues with colluding with the people you are supposed to be fighting and the lack of any way to really deal with it. 
---
You can only try to out tag your own faction, but as soon as you win they call in people from the other faction who only kill you. Now you say ok, we will just bring in our guild to fight them off, well at that point you still have your own faction trying to grief you. Scouting your group, telling them where and how many you are and making the fight basically impossible. This is where those rules make sense. 
---
If you were trying to fight off an opposite faction group to get at the mobs then it's all in the game. But having a group you can't do a thing to griefing you is just abuse.
---
His dad owns a dealership!
---
Ok buddy. But I'm still going to call these redundant threads out because it's obvious that no one is even remotely interested.
---
I love all of the hunters grouped up on the left hand side. It gives the photo a dynamic similar too setting up your army in CIV5
---
Stock up for release then, if the hype keeps up we will surely crash some zones/servers. :)
---
I'm seeing a lot of information suggesting that Paladins do a good job tanking dungeons since their main tanking weakness - going OOM - can be combatted by drinking between pulls. There's also no taunt ability but with marking the kill target it should still work. I'm considering going Paladin or Druid in classic because I'd love to be able to tank and heal on the same character, but I know it wouldn't be as good as a warrior.
---
Here is the link https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info24985-ModernQuestWatch.html
---
Good luck! I leveled a horde toon just to do the quest to summon him, but it was sometime during wrath.
---
I mean...it's the beta...and there's a level cap...
---
Attention Local hunters.
---
I will be more than happy to help you on your pet gathering expeditions. Just hit me up if we happen to end up on the same server.
---
(Horde, PvP, Server Name Pending)
---
Your Friend,
---
Troll Shaman
---
So how many do you think classic will attract? More than 500k? There's a better chance classic is less people than vanila than the other way round.
---
Lol 😂 ty
---
are you 12? Everything seems cringe to you once it becomes popular
---
No way really? If you’re big enough like soda or asmon you’d have just as many people rushing to defend you. Would make such amazing content. Constant world pvp all the way up to 60
---
Take a boat to where?
---
&gt; [–]xantek

&gt;21 points 6 hours ago* 
---
&gt;Here is a list of good players that I know is currently streaming classic wow beta. All the dudes listed are very good
---
I'm interested when they are articulate. Also, please refer to Rule 2 of the sub - "or attempt to gate-keep discussion."
---
I grind in the 40s because my questing motivation dies.
---
Can u tame beasts that’s higher lvl than u? Pet becomes your lvl?
---
Much as I am happy to sink my teeth into the old game I would definitely like to see a secondary WoW branch out of this with totally different design philosophies. They could also try to take the lore in a different direction with some of the old major players.  
---
In the end leaving us with current Retail being one team and this being another. Retail going down the convenience road they are currently at and this going down the actual RPG route. Mmm.
---
yes. I pretty much specifically played PvE in Vanilla, was decked out, had Naxx gear but not a full set. Switched gears in TBC and focus on Arenas (still raided but had more fun in the arenas) and I quit WoW in 2009, so WothLK I believe. 
---
What do I miss the most out of all the content? The arenas, I miss my full arena gear and the countless hours me and my buddies put into it and strategies we had to develop over time. That is what i miss. 
---
I am happy to say I am coming back for Classic as that was always really fun, but I really want arenas. If they can integrate it into Classic, im for it, if not and drop a new TBC, lets do it. I just had such a blast with them.
---
Oh for sure it could hit hard and garner a decent chunk of threat but when it boils down to the nitty gritty details most times people would simply used the rage for more sunders rather than the more expensive Shield slam.
---
Don't get me wrong I actually love going deep Prot and getting Shield slam I just understand it has its limitations.
---
So they were ahead of what a WF guild needs to be? Considering Method owed god knows how much for their last WF kill the taking from other guilds/realms is still a thing today.
---
"Awesome, thanks!"
---
Asmon said in his own stream that with a big ass ball of people around him all the time he would never actually get to level and the content of the constant fluster cluck around him would grow dull quickly
---
Goes well with all the fine whines in this thread.
---
Is it available on bnet?
---
something, something good rebuttal. Could you be more generic or it just because you're bored of life?
---
Oh my Satan I love it!
---
Mages farm well only in a couple of specific spots -- DM:E lashers and DM:N dogs and bugs. If Blizzard nerfs thos spots, then mages end up close to the bottom of the pack for gold farming. Meanwhile hunters will be good gold farmers even if Blizzard leaves no options aside from killing mobs in the landscape. They can handle EPL bats or Azshara satyrs better than anyone else; being able to solo Mara, Tribute and DM:W is just icing.
---
Kala for shadow priest and sodapoppin is a good druid
---
Ok so you mentioned 4 things. That is like 2 levels MAYBE 3. Also Thorium Point quests are 47+ if you want to do them "easily". ZF you should probably be 45+. Hinterlands depends on faction but for Horde its 45+. 40-52 is by far the worst part of levelling.
---
yeah, you can buy the reforged version and you get both
---
I believe Classic WoW automatically has the option to track newly picked up quests. At least it did for me in the stress test. I was using Questie, but it was located under the normal interface options.
---
Tbf this kinda of post telling people to play a certain way is 100x more aggravating to me than people asking for class/race/spec comparisons.
---
Once you get near the top, you can just level it doing regular grinding and dungeons.
---
Yep, that was me lmao. I was so salty when I got pulled into a layer with like 2 or 3 people in org.
---
Probably is his stream schedule is basically incompatible with most US viewers. I have been watching him on Youtube for years, but can never catch his stream. Not his fault obviously, just time zones.
---
"General? I guess, if having a 1 way time delayed broadcast makes you a leader. "
---
No having 100+ people following you around whenever you ask does in fact make you a general. If your saying he's doing a bad job. I would agree but, If you can rally the troops like he can. You are in fact a general. As far as his skill or big vanilla brain. He's still pretty new and, he has Esfand. Who I am sure will help him get more knowledgeable over time.
---
Also curious as someone who writes code
---
&gt; On the bright side, Blizzard has acknowledged the issue and said they may offer free realm transfers to people who get screwed over by a streamer server.
---
source?
---
how is it "evil" that the dude who loves WoW wants some peace and quiet before he inevitably gets swarmed by a bunch of retards?
---
Now I wanna roll hunter
---
Agree with a few, but think you are incorrectly attributing flaws that came later back to TBC. Particularly:
---
* Class Homogenization
---
* Lore Issues
---
* Gear verticality
---
I think you also missed one of the major problem decisions made for TBC: 
---
Removing expansion content from old world content. One of the big immersion/world builders for Vanilla was that the major cities were hubs for ALL players at every stage in the game. You would have level 8 dwarfs running into Iron Forge for the first time, maybe running to the forge to smelt some copper bars, and next to him is a Warrior forging an Arcanite Reaper. And he passes T2 decked Rogue on the way to the AH, and marvels at what the end game set looks like. Characters shared the world, even if you werent seeing the inside of BWL, and end game raiders weren't showing up to your Uldaman group, it still felt like you shared the world becuase you would see them in the major cities. Shattrah basically ruins this, as it effectively removed characters in the mid-end game from the rest of the leveling crowd, and made the 1-60 experience feel "left behind".
---
 From blizzards blue post:
---
* Using the “Automatic Quest Tracking” option does not auto-track  newly accepted quests. (It instead will start to track an existing quest  once progress towards an objective is started.)
---
If you could make that happen that'd be amazing.
---
&gt;New dungeons should get some hate, mostly because they are linear and designed around speed runs.
---
That was his point. Vanilla dungeons were semi-frequently masses of places. Very befitting of the dungeon title. Current instances tend to be one lane speedways of loot. While the mechanics of the bosses and (seldomely) thet rash could get you a bit it was often nothing more than a single slide down toward loot.
---
&gt; "Classic will soon be upon us"
---
87 days 2 hours 17 minutes and 26 seconds is 'soon' to you?
---
MOM! More hot pockets 
---
https://youtu.be/ust_Er_oX5A
---
Still not a recommendation. I wasnt saying that either of them are the best hunter streamers. Simply that they exist and that he can add one or both if he chooses. I've still contributed more than you have so please suggest an alliance hunter stream.
---
Waiting for Destiny 2’s new raid next week. Been dabbling in the Classic Beta, mostly to build an addon, but I haven’t actually played much.
---
I would do this all the time on my paladin in vanilla... with the exception of the douchenozzles who would run up to me and /s HEAL
---
Those guys I let die.
---
Really been enjoying venruki recently. Can reccomend.
---
the source code can be found in the addon's lua file
---
He didn't say that. At all. He said it's the bread and butter of the class.
---
Reading comprehension is hard.
---
Your post is a lecture.  If your post had said what your comment said I would have criticized it differently.  
---
Even if there were a ton of posts about the same thing ignore them instead of making a post crying about them
---
What I'm doing isn't [gatekeeping](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Gatekeeping).
---
you can give them underwater breathing
---
The real question is how do you expect to get runecloth at level 30 and what the he’ll would you use it on?
---
I liked tetra master more.
---
Cool, thanks
---
What exactly is sperging? I can infer from context it’s possibly a mix of being juvenile and insincere, but I really don’t know what it means specifically.
---
you can just see it on retail lol, they legit always have 10+ people following them at all times doing whatever it is they think will get them attention, and it will only be amplified on non sharded servers. shit's really lame and I would prefer a server without it
---
Illidan was like 95% Alliance and 5% Horde in Vanilla.
---
Yeah, now that I'm having it explained to me (got downvoted but otherwise people are being nice, that's a good sign for this community) I can see how it could work. 
---
Still, sounds like it comes online later (needs Spell Power to generate enough threat) and might require talents that aren't ideal for leveling. If you care about tanking intances casually as you level Warrior or Druid are probably preferred, but high level Paladin tanking seems interesting.
---
It was a bug from 1.12 client so no reason to fix it imo
---
It's going to get expansions, people will ask for it.
---
All druids must pick flowers lol
---
lots of paladins dont pay attention to the buffs or auras already present and override them
---
It’s the skills at about 30 cost around 1g each but if someone’s buying every version of every skill and not selling all their crap they might be short.
---
Well, I was only in the top end guild scene for a while (nax - till tbc lady vashj), and we had a good relationship with a lot of high end guilds. I remember discussing with other guilds about The Lurker Below (Finding out NA vs EU water shit) when I was in The Legacy. 
---
From what I remember, The Destiny did not really sell them, but give them with the promise that their tanks / people would help us out with 4hm / saph etc
---
FCK sake should have added my  /S  i guess its so subtle but thanks for jumping to their defense
---
oh yeah I’m not disagreeing that some of them have a crazy annoying following haha
---
I'm sure they all could if they had viewers funneling items to them too.
---
Reminds me of my first toon (troll hunters) taming The Take in Mulgore. Thank you friendly orc warrior for showing a newbie in 2006 this awesome pet!
---
That is LITERALLY what you are doing. 
---
"Do not post your thoughts here because I deem them meaningless and unoriginal."
---
i kinda wanna go 31 holy just for holy shock but i dont want to be a healer at all
---
A true mage bro would stop and trade food or water
---
you might have to wait a month for that, there are other more full-fledged addons that can track quests like Questie
---
Vanillawowdb is a pserver's database. The first thing you see on that website is "This website uses the Official [Tights Rope] World Database, for 100% accurate information."
---
I have posted proof that Magmadar had [3731 armor in 2006](https://web.archive.org/web/20060413193842/http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v26/ErikVKing/Magmadar-BeastLore.jpg). The value on vanillawowdb is **Armor: 4,691**.
---
That's the definition of buffing boss armor, and proof that your claim that "vanillawowdb is a database leak" is straight up wrong. I'm going to base my arguments on screenshots from 2006 rather than Nost's forums.
---
My body is ready.
---
Grind and skin beasts from 35-40 and you'll have your mount gold ready.
---
It’s wishful thinking. But it’s never to early to plan.
---
Would engineering make you change your mind ? I have never tried with a warlock but I guess it could make them beasts for wpvp
---
I thought the stress test ended yesterday?
---
Nope. The first bosses of AQ40 are much easier than the later ones.
---
I found a link from [wowwiki](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Temple_of_Ahn%27Qiraj):
---
&gt;The Temple of Ahn'Qiraj scales more in difficulty than other instances. The first few bosses are on par with the harder bosses in Molten Core and the last bosses are harder than anything you find in Blackwing Lair.
---
Keep in mind that guilds later in vanilla could gear up in ZG and AQ20. Plus for some of the bosses, even the BWL guilds were wearing blues and greens with nature resist.
---
How did he tamed 11lvl bear at lvl 10?
---
Vergil?
---
The line between tank and dps is very blurred. You can just be a dps who is willing to tank and you will probably have a great time. You will tank about 1/2 of the time in raids. And MT 5/10/20mans. 
---
I did this on a private server recently and it was an absolute blast. Its fun because its like you have 2 characters in one, and it gives you power to help yourself and your friends by simply organizing your own dungeon/raids and tanking them.
---
&gt;The ledges were in the wrath release.
---
Nah, they were in vanilla. Maybe they were in wrath too.
---
I'll be honest, I dont know the exact meaning lol.  I've also inferred it as severely overreacting to everything, going all caps, yelling like crazy.  Like quin yelling at the top of his lungs over losing a duel.  Or twitch chat just spamming poggers for hours lol.
---
The AH.
---
Fair enough, sounds like some old school type of boosting service haha! I always used to like how seeing TLB from a characters eyes would be just casually fishing then booooshh!! Also still hate his water beam to this day, amount of guidies who got hit ... nightmares!
---
I seem to remember that being the case. I think one common method was to ice trap an animal then tame it.
---
Nice. Thank you. I’ll check that out. Most of the YouTube content doesn’t have gameplay along with it because it’s from private servers. So anyone showing mechanics etc will be helpful! Cheers
---
Hi, /u/zathos91
---
What would you guys do with yourselves if there weren’t streamers to hate all day? Probably go back to hating on blizz. 
---
The sky is falling! The streamers are coming!
---
How I have waited for this day!
---
That would be mageweave a damn slight more attainable than runecloth at level 30. The lowest level mob you must kill for nunecloth is level 44~45
---
Mained a Warrior from BC to WoD
---
Leveling up was bumpy, and being new i tried a bunch of things professions wise. 
---
Of all the professions i tried here is what i recommend:
---
**For Leveling:** Herb/Alch - Those potions are life saving. Having access to a large amount of health potions from the start allow me to engage mobs confidently and help alot for the stragglers that like to tag along.  The immense amount of types of potions make up for warrior's lack of utility. If you keep up with it while you level you will have a potion for every situation and will greatly improve your leveling experience (which is horrid in my opinion)
---
**Most Enjoyable:** Mining/Eng - I enjoy gadgets and really liked all the cool things engineering allowed you to do.  It is a *pain* to level up but is really worth it. Mining is mostly to support Engineering, it can be very expensive so you can save alot by just getting the mats yourself, the *majority* comes mining but i did find myself buying alot. Ores/bars sell for alot, so mining is a real money maker selling the things you don't need.
---
**Enchanting:** Money maker later on if you get the right enchants. Plus mats sell for a ton, once you are capped you can run lower leveled dungeons and D/E the greens/blues make some real cash. From a leveling standpoint its more taxing because anything you aren't using will be going towards D/E instead of vendoring for monies.  Enchants are nice but aren't really worth it unless you are twinking. You are better off holding off until later levels. 
---
**Ultimately:** Pick a set of professions that are going to benefit your focus. 
---
Money Making=Two gathering
---
Utility=Eng/Alch
---
Improved Leveling experience = Alch 
---
Crafting professions like BS and LW aren't super beneficial to the leveling process. Decent gear sometimes but you are better off with dungeon gear until the end. (IMO) 
---
And of course i recommend getting and leveling all the secondary professions.
---
First Aid is mandatory as a warrior.
---
Yeh level 30 cap means at most you’ve done 3 zones of questing. Going 30-50 is where you begin finding quest for a level or two then need to grind for a bit or hop zones for more quest. It can be a pain in the butt but it’s not hard unless your a solo warrior or rogue. Then it’s just a bit tedious cause those two classes seem slow to me.
---
Ah, good to know. I could have sworn that when I accepted a quest it started tracking it right away. Could be wrong!
---
Nothing much to worry about it be like 3 servers with most streamers. You will have plenty
---
Mage with enchanting and tailoring.
---
Hi, /u/Microstocker
---
A Fury warrior that throws on Prot gear is as good an offtank as a Feral Druid and the Fury Warrior will actually be useful when he’s not tanking.
---
Definitely true for me.
---
That is some next level RP right there.
---
Don’t get me wrong - if you have the help and can get it early - by all means definitely do it. It’s so worth it. But for me - leveling hard usually means there’s not a whole lot of help to be had
---
He'e the "very professional" guy with porn on his twitter account.
---
In the current meta, a raid group usually takes 8-12 warriors. So if you're decent enough, its easy to get a raid spot.
---
Hardcore guilds take can even bring 20+ warriors to a speedrun.
---
He made the game and supposedly ruined it, basically going full circle
---
Okay so I guess we are talking about Asmon? 
---
I actually enjoy his content, just to get that out of the way, I also don’t think he is a bad player. I just don’t think he is a leader yet. I can name 10 other streamers who have greater vanilla knowledge and better strategic (and tactical) understanding of wow Pvp, Who I’d rather have igl my abs and wsgs.
---
But that’s fine. I truly don’t care, I just see a blatant juxtaposition between how people got ingame famous in vanilla (time, skill, gear, video production) vs now.
---
Asmon will log in on day 1 and be the most famous person on the server for the entirety of its life span. Kungen and Nihilim had to get world first. 
---
It’s going to be really interesting how streaming affects the social dynamics of wow classic.
---
what content does vanilla have that we havent done? what are you going to be able to do 6 months after reaching level 60 when you cant pvp because its all account sharing. what are you gonna do when you clear all raids in 4 hours on tuesday.
---
the game has no content and youre too ignorant to see that.
---
aka. rose-tinted glasses. honeymoon phase. grass is awlays greener.
---
Really? That's the hill you want to die on? They have space ships dude.
---
This makes me smile so I dont mind
---
I dunno that sounds pretty complicated. They'd have to put like three npc teleporters in. I dunno if Blizzard could handle it.
---
I'm like 99% sure Blizzard said they had the amount of players they wanted for the beta now. So I wouldn't resub.
---
You didnt, the guy I replied to and thus this whole chain is in relation to the voting rights in OSRS. 
---
And what defines high rank? That's such an ambiguous title that it means nothing. Because on retail, it's basically the pro arena players who get to give feedback and fuck everyone else, which is how we got the current state of arenas. Is it anyone above rank 10? Rank 12? Because that still doesnt mean you'll get good feedback, as vanilla ranks are a show of how much you grind and are based very little on actual PvP skill. As much as the current arena rating system sucks, it's still way better than the time = rank system. 
---
These arent good factors to allow people to vote, end of story. Obtain your dungeon 2 set? That's a fair metric because it's a grind but it is easily obtainable, similar to 300 skill points in OSRS.
---
From what I hear shadowres pvp druid does well with just outsustaining. This video of a big SL warlock got fucked by a druid with full SR was really fun https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UixnJI-6n4
---
Another is well played rogue https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3_FkK_Fsfk
---
Try stardew valley
---
Arms is the best spec for dungeons, due to sweeping strikes.
---
Fury scales better with world buffs and gear and offers higher single target dps, so its better for raids.
---
Hi, /u/non-sum-dignus
---
1h shield go down enhance tree, grab first aid, switch to ele at 40 buy dream weave gloves and chest have fun zapping. The totem range talent and mana cost reduction aren’t worth it when ur mostly using a very low mana cost totem in searing totem. 
---
I only suggest the ele part Bc I absolutely despise leveling shaman before ele is viable. Ele mastery might be one of the strongest talents when it comes to wpvp at low levels. Just using it with earthshock can wipe out half an opponents hp given everyone is in quest gear.
---
Chuck Norris can melt ants with a magnifying glass, at night.
---
&gt;You didn't necessarily even know who the best players were outside of the absolute top guilds
---
Personally I preferred it this way. Some of the old recruitment tests I've heard about were pretty fantastic. Like one big raid guild required hunters to kill a certain elite world spawn without anything but their bow and such like that.
---
that combined with gearscore
---
So that's what it takes? Just *asking?*
---
Truly marvelous.
---
Quit complaining about beta invites and just eat her a, skinny boy.
---
i'll report it for you now
---
Misread, thought you meant crossed the ocean as in from mulgore
---
But if you could do content requiring more tanks with fewer healers, how likely is it that there would be much (if any) value to an additional healer when fewer tanks were needed?
---
I don't really want to see this, I want to see them progress to TBC and eventually WOTLK. I know people won't agree with me and thats ok, just voicing my own opinion
---
Couldn't resist trying to make this guy mad haha
---
I haven’t seen anyone since their blue post say they got into beta. They said the invites will slow down but I think that was more of “there is no invites but we won’t say that because we want noobs to sub still”
---
This is one of the coolest pictures I've seem from Beta
---
I'm sorry, BFA what?
---
Mid/early vanilla guards had no way to swat you off places that they couldn't path. No ranged attacks iirc. People abused the fuck out of this in a lot of places. The stealthed guards in orgrimmar that travel on the roofs are a sort of easter egg regarding that time.
---
If you are willing to heal you shouldn't worry. Healers will always be in demand.
---
What?
---
You may be suffering a stroke. 
---
Read what I wrote, especially the second sentence, which follows the first. “However, in the wrath version you could be feared off the ledge” by virtue of my entire post and what it was replying to...it’s assumed I’m aware of the vanilla ledges since I pointed out how the wrath ledges worked differently.
---
So you wanna be dual welding then?
---
Is there a class/spec where running 2h is viable?
---
You should go see my post above regarding OSRS and why it doesn’t apply directly to WoW’s scenario. 
---
Btw, my addon collected pings from about 2.4 million accounts month, which is up about 3% from last month (which would be expected from Classic announcement). It should be noted that in no way do I think everyone uses my addon. I would also estimate (could be waaayyy off) 10% of the playerbase doesn’t use any addons at all. 
---
I do, very heavily, agree that WoW could end up like OSRS. I just don’t think it’s anytime soon. As mentioned, RS was on its deathbed. WoW is not on its deathbed. While it may not be 10 million players like it used to, even 1 million is still quite successful.
---
Your bedroom life must be absolutely abysmal, or it would be if you had one... Hey if you have a girlfriend and she reads this, maybe she'll get in touch with me. ;)
---
Sure, you can find a place if you're sub-optimal. It just might not be the place that you hoped to find. Of course everyone is free to play whatever the want, but that doesn't entitle them to have others facilitate and support their playstyle. There's a saying, "When in Rome, do as the Romans do." If you want to be part of a successful raiding guild, act how the successful raiders act. If you're cool being part of a bumblefuck casual raiding guild that never ends up seeing all the content, then take it easy.
---
Just like in real life: Sure, you don't have to min-max your schooling or career choice -- it's your life. Just don't expect that casual attitude to yield the same employment choices as those enjoyed who do min-max.
---
You know, when you see a pic of a grown ass woman, naked, and an obvious child, thats statutory rape. Pretty much everywhere.
---
What's going through my head is "that kid is gonna enjoy his statutory rape"
---
I lived it, played vanilla 2004-2007 fairly heavily.  I had 18 **days** played when I dinged 60, admittedly in no rush, but that's 432 hours in a game.  By comparison, I played the hell out of Zelda Breath of the Wild and stand at 150 hours in that game, the only major thing left is to find more korok seeds, for no particular reason.
---
We are years away from this, but I think it would be awesome if implemented correctly. I’d love to see them do the south sea expansion like they originally anticipated. I’d personally prefer no raise to the level cap. Maybe even add voting for the community like runescape. But if they did add it l, it might be best to create new servers for this rather than update classic servers.
---
Mages, priests, shamans, druids and locks are kings.
---
This is a big double-edged blade. Can't force people to play what they don't want, and people can't force others to bring "non-meta (or whatever the reason)" specs to their adventures.
---
An dangerous issue that Blizzard is yet to correctly solve in retail WoW, and it's connected to the current internet culture - this same community will be the one playing Classic.
---
Shamans good against locks? They might be one of the most annoying classes to face. All they have to do is put curse of tongues on you and dot u up from range. Now ur telling me they’d be good against soul link locks? Hell no.
---
Weapon speed still affects white attack damage without normalization, so a slower weapon benefits from that, due to higher burst from extra attacks.
---
Not in raids or PvP. 
---
For marathon kiting downranking arcane shot is sometimes needed.
---
Shit game with good card game vs good game with shit card game
---
There's always goblin sapper charge too, for that early aoe threat.
---
Warriors and rogues benefit most from r14. Shadow priest if you want to simply melt faces in blues (ideal for solo play in BGs or world).
---
Hi, /u/Sybalis
---
Hi, /u/GaunerHarakiri
---
Divided.
---
Was in classic too, raids would use los on the throne
---
wth man male night elf has some sick muy thai leg kicks. I agree though as a whole male night elves are the absolute worst lol
---
Horizontal progression. 
---
Not vertical like tbc. 
---
Adding expansions makes the world smaller.
---
I wonder if you'll be able to start on a PVP server then transfer to an RP-PVE server several months later?
---
Not to mention his incompetence compelty ruined a game company that was super fucking cool.
---
He hitched his entire identity on gamergate, being a massive freak who claimed he was booted from the industry because of political correctness.
---
I'll wager like 99 percent of the shit he is saying isnt even true
---
I played started on Legion and played Bfa, now went to vanilla private server and will never go back to retail Wow. Classic Hype!
---
I dig, but for some of us the fun is in theory crafting and trying to flex nuts with pixels, race to 60 etc...  I think most of the posts centered on Race X vs Race Y are probably coming from that viewpoint as most of the true casuals a'rent trolling r/classicwow
---
Just my 2 cents you filthy casual  (jkjk)
---
what if the male night elf does muy thai instead of flashy tae kwon do kicks??
---
I agree with this but for a different reason: I hate all leveling zones in that level range. Stranglthorn is the sole exception but as a horde player you basically can't really quest there below 37. Yes, there are some quests here and there, but not nearly enough to get you more than 1 or 2 levels at most.
---
And the other zones in that level range?
---
\- Thousand Needles. I hate it except for Shimmering Flats.
---
\- Desolace. I hate it, oh god it's so boring.
---
\- Arathi Highlands. I hate it.
---
There are still some other zones like Dustwallow (which was 35+ I think), Alterac (more like 40) and Swamps of Sorrow (also more like 40). I am going to dread that level range already, I just hate everything about it.
---
You need 3/3 improved hamstring and anger management is just a overall good talent. 2 % dmg is not noticeable, compared to a hamstring proc.
---
Literally 3 camps of people, #nochanges people, new content people, and regular progression through WoTLK people.  I love this community
---
Sorry that your poor sentence construction lead people to believe something than what you intended. Next time I'll sign you up for English 101 I guess?
---
This is what the first M stands for in an MMORPG in my opinion, retail forgot about that part
---
Yeah, it's 99% frostbolt spamming. Moving is something everyone does. Using ice block when you're close to dying? Sure, but defensive cooldowns are also something everyone uses Trinkets, engineering items and pots: nothing stops hunters/rogues from using them.
---
Each class has a core "rotation" that's simply used during the majority of the fight. That's just how it is. All the gimmicks are wide spread. So I personally prefer a class with 2-3 more buttons or things to care for in bossfights.
---
We used to invite someone new to the group and then leave group. It transferred the instance ID to the new person. Typically, we’d just ask for a volunteer in guild chat.
---
If you are just simply looking to be profitable then I can offer a couple solid suggestions.
---
1. Living Stratholme is your best friend for profitability, Rightous Orbs alone can make up a great deal of your income, I believe there is at least a single gaurenntied one per run that if you can claim as part of your rules then that is an easy 10-20 gold and if it's early in a servers lifespan and the Crusader enchant is still rare then the Orbs can easily be 50G each.
---
2. High value items - change your mentality from selling full run's to instead selling high value boss's.  Hand of Justice in BRD is a very high value trinket that can be reached by skipping a large portion of the dungeon, Focus on selling runs specifically for high value items and increase your price appropriately, HoJ is rare enough that realistically a player should have to purchase potentially 10 or more runs from you to drop even once and if you can master the path needed to reach The Emperor than even better.
---
3. Onxyia Attunement and UBRS, To get attuned to Onxyia's lair a player needs to run UBRS a minimum of three seperate times to complete all the quests necissary, if you can build a group of 7-8 players that can speed run that place and charge appropriately then that is a highly valuable dungeon to be know for being able to complete.
---
Magic: The Gathering
---
Yeah no I'd rather take a guild of 5 all the same, but you do you. At least you are aware enough of how utterly scummy and pathetic a practice is going on.
---
I have something personal against asmon, I'll be avoiding him. All others are passable
---
Or even a video explaining the back story of the world leading up to starting a character.
---
Bad bot
---
Theres no "supposedly". He 100 percent ruined it. And no, he didnt make the game lol. 
---
He spent multiple millions of dollars on a shitty firefall themed game bus that consumed all of their fundraising cash.
---
EVERY fucking 3 months or so he would completly fuck over planned developments to rework the combat and craft system and nothing EVER got into a final form because Kern was a dipshit
---
I think the trick is to remove your gear so it doesn't break ;)
---
What about an Affliction lock, with VW Demonic sacrifice?
---
Just like a real raid, half the people doing nothing.
---
They could eventually try to develop vanilla content to certain extent. No matter how successful and great the game is, it can always be improved. I would love to see that, if they communicate with playerbase about the changes
---
One interesting option that comes to mind would be gear that makes some of those BC changes to heroes. That's one way to bring BC changes to Classic content/new dungeons/loot.
---
Did you mean Barlow? I assume you do.
---
If anyone here can understand German, do yourself a favor and listen to [THIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpfImja-e1w)
---
It's Barlow and he's really awesome.
---
Can you not get the quest for the antidote and fel moss at the same time? The grells drop mushrooms as well.
---
Jeez this sub is starting to fill up with toxic elitists from private servers. You people will barely have fun with this game if you treat it like a high standard professional job lol
---
Off topic, but what are your recommendations for resources to learn about hunter? I'm bored at work and would like to do some reading/watching about them.
---
Gladiator is a good standard for Arena. Top 0.5% seems good if you are wanting balance. 
---
You really dont think letting everyone vote would be a good idea do you. Or even lower people. look at world of roguecraft (I know its a meme) but people were saying rogues were not OP when they could kill R14s naked.
---
I'd like to know the details too
---
Reading comments like these that think they can somehow gank Sodapoppin easily is making me laugh. The guy is legitimately great at PvP, and he plays arguably the most difficult class to gank in Vanilla, and probably one of the strongest dueling classes. He'll also be way out ahead of 99% of players leveling, and will be geared before 99.999% of players from it being his job to play, being good at the game, and having an endless amount of players to play with him.
---
hmmm, aren't those kobold laborers supposed to be aggro? I never played alliance, but the undead cave all the spiders in the mine are aggro, and the Pserver i played (for like 3 hours as human) they were all aggro... strange thing for the pserver to get wrong
---
Expansions route is just a resuscitation that lasts only so long and wow will be soon dead again. Blizzard needs a new vanilla wow like fantasy world simulator to achieve long asting success. Classic'+' is  one option but I doubt there will be anything other than few expansions again and the game is gone.
---
Tbc is more polished but it was more of a game than a fantasy world simulation.
---
its not the future. wanna know how i know its not the future because unlike you i played vanilla 15 years ago.
---
unless they change how r14 works, youre never gonna get close because all the top guys will be account sharing in a premade 24 hours a day.
---
raids are actually going to get easier then what the tank and spanks were because there are 16 raid debuffs compared to 8 as there originally was.
---
youre lying to yourself if you honestly cant see passed your rose-tinted glasses.
---
The main tank is the only player I want absolutely min-maxed. I want him being human because he's carrying the entire raid on his shoulders. Otherwise I don't give a shit. I'll invite dwarf priests over others if I really need the fearwards but that's quite rare.
---
Did the same thing back in vanilla with my all-white Tauren. He was just *meant* to have Mangeclaw. No regrets.
---
Happy hunting, my dude.
---
I forgot faction transfers had become a thing. I guess that plays a part because in vanilla you had to invest so much time in your character to get to raiding, it wasn't feasible to start over just like that. I guess that's how it will be in Classic as well.
---
Seems like it would mess up your character's sense of identity flip flopping factions and thus races so much, but hey...
---
I am one of those peeps. Never experience any type of raids, or pvp. Because I didn’t really want to level to 110. So technically wow will be brand new to me
---
Ja!
---
Yeah lmao. Like I said the stream itself has cool trivia. Just... Don't google him lmao.
---
how is that compared to the 2019 version, wondering about if the upgrade is worth it.
---
It depends on how well the person engages with the social aspect of the game. If they're funny and engaging then it's worth carrying a little for the entertainment value and relationship. If they never speak on disc, are boring, and/or raidlog then why not bring a more effective non-person instead?
---
Hold my Rumsey Rum Black Label.  I'm [going in.](http://www.bossroyal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/BR-10.png)
---
Glad I'm not the only one that found that "INV TO X LAYER!!!" spam annoying. It didn't matter if I was in general chat, trade chat or world chat, you couldn't escape it. Even after layers are gone I can still see that inv spam being a thing every time one of those big guys decides to host an event. No thanks.
---
Man, I love World of Warcraft.
---
not..not worth it
---
So I really want to main fury warrior because that is 100% my type of class and I cannot really myself having another main. However, I am a little spooked that there will be many other warriors. Because of this, is it going to be very competitive in raids for me to get my loot? Will it be hard for me to find guilds/raids in general because of the large population or is there always room for fury warriors?
---
But flying is fun and players are just too stupid to use them while hovering over the ground. Do you remember the WOTLK zones that you actually need flying for? I can fly through storm peaks for hours just looking at shit. They should have at-least made flying mounts dismount instantly when attacked by another player, but ultimately I love them.
---
Yep.  Rank 1 serpent sting for debuff protection, rank 1 arcane shot for getting a rogue in combat, rank 1 multishot to save mana.
---
Well, one of the peoples most favorite dungeon - Deadmines (and to some extent Shadowfang Keep) are just as linear as most of the Legion and BfA dungeons. While the later dungeons have more complex mechanics for mobs and bosses.
---
Now im not saying BfA dungeons are in general better than Deadmines or SFK, but its not as huge a discrepancy as people would like to think.
---
I know that now, but sadly not at 14 lol
---
They're not. In fact one of the things he talked about was that they purposefully made them not aggro to give beginner players a chance to learn before giving them too hard of a challenge.

I'd link you where he says that but I'm at work now. It's near the beginning though, as he starts fighting them.
---
I doubt you make it to raids, your going to have to gear up first in normal dungeons and that's going to take a long time, normal 5 man dungeons take 2 to 4 hours, and your not guaranteed to get the items you want or need, so it's going to take multiple times to run them.
---
she was prob too busy spamming INVITE ASMON LYR in /1
---
I certainly see the implications cross faction colluding can bring. 
---
I just feel as though it’s on players to break the cartel. If they fried the devilsaur...tell the alliance when the cartel members raid on your faction. Blow them up everynight. Boycott devilsaur—it isn’t needed to clear MC. Form your own roaming pvp groups with the opposite faction to cruise around looking for the mafia members. Drag agro onto them. 
---
There are ways to ruin their fun and stifle their profits. 
---
Blacklist these cats. If they want to cartel—great—you’re now cut off from the rest of the server. No one will group with you, no one will enchant your shit, etc. since everyone is boycotting your leather, and you’re spending all day killing devilsaurs, it isn’t as though they are swimming in cash. 
---
Crash their discord server. Ddos their guild website.
---
If they start to collude—that’s fine—but the gloves come off. 
---
If only we could select entire guilds on the same faction to be hostile towards.
---
One of my favorite zones in Wow for sure.
---
Huh. So if I reserve Asmongold plus my actual character's name, I could reduce my chance of ending up on a streamer server . . .
---
Either Asmongold is already taken, and I find a new server, or Asmongold is not taken, and then in theory he would pick a different server.
---
The only invites that went out without active subscriptions were Friends &amp; Family and ones for marketing purposes.
---
Everyone else needed a subscription.
---
I say needed because Blizzard is done sending out invites.
---
Yeah thanks. I guess I will go with the safer bet and go hunter.
---
Downranking aimed shot and multi-shot to rank 1 makes them very mana efficient sources of damage. In raids you should never need to downrank if you use proper consumables. In PvP you rarely will need to downrank, certainly not something to do by default, but if you get low on mana you can downrank to get more value out of your remaining mana. When solo grinding it's more efficient to downrank to rank 1 aimed/multi than to use max rank and drink more often between mobs.
---
that polar bear looks like a puppy next to tauren
---
Imp is fine, but Blizzard nerfed being able to do Demon Sacrifice + Master Demonology somewhere around 1.5 or so and then demonology and demons in general fucked off and died for PVE.
---
I'll have to take a peak
---
I am going to fish.

And what? Tempest Keep is somehow weirder in Warcraft lore than anything else? The Titans have giant laboratories of sci-fi bullshittery throughout Azeroth, Outland was connected via a space-time gate, an entire playable race in Vanilla is based on Clockpunk... There's nothing odd about Warcraft lore being a hogde-podge of science fantasy tropes. It was like that well before TBC.
---
Tempest Keep, and by extension the Exodar, is a mystical quasi-"scientific", quasi-magical transdimensional wormhole ship. Their creators are eldritch beings of pure energy floating around after their long-ago creation in the Great Dark Beyond. What makes them any weirder than the Void Lords? Or the Burning Legion, for that matter? Why are "spaceships" somehow bizarre in this universe? Things have been moving around in space for a long time in *Warcraft*, often as an amalgamation of literal magic and [sufficiently advanced alien tech.](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien)

Mage is a staple class in a bg group, as is priests/paladins. Shamans will have a spot as well as ele/resto. Warriors are the anchor of the team to control the mid, and usually a top choice for rankers. You can get by also as a hunter or lock, people who play these classes to their full potential can be very disruptive to a team, although horde side locks usually get fucked by the fact that pallys and priests can dispel their shit whereas horde only has priest for that. 
---
You can honestly be any class besides rogue/druid if you want to be in the center of the fray. Honestly even locks/hunters get stuck with defensive work as well rather than being part of the pain train. 
---
What class did you have in mind?
---
Needs more DBZ power up animation.
---
I'm on the edge with mage or hunter. I thought I was sure about mage but today I figured that hunter might be a safer bet.
---
One of my favorite things to do is tag mobs with some weak form of damage right before a random hits it, so the aggro goes on him but I get the credit while he's forced to kill my mob and I move on and kill something else.
---
Am I doing it right?
---
look at all these retards who can't operate a mouse properly. This is why we can't have nice things

I figured it would take a while. Some one else tamed a throwaway and named it “letmetameit”. Seems like it might work. In vanilla a had a horde buddy that summoned it for me.
---
Reminds me of the last time i played on the pserver I rolled a NE huntress and traveled to Durotar to tame one of those tigers. Sure felt special
---
Just as long as you are OK with healing at 60. Shammys are pretty awesome. I can't decide between Tauren shammy or forsaken priest
---
For the love of Elune...
---
Oh lord... I remember using the free demo version of fraps. What a time to be alive that was.
---
Aww, this gave me the Feelnillas!  I spent forever getting broken tooth and that rare Pink Strider back in the day.  Felt so good afterwards.
---
Is it just hybrid spec Prot/Fury and keep a shield around? I'd worry about missing out on loot priority.
---
Everyone knows that though, they still would pick it over retail.
---
Stuff you don't understand.

I dont terribly care for the mount situation. I'll ride a kodo like I always have. The great kodo is the only mount for me.

---
If you don’t mind elaborating? DM would be fine to. I’m just curious as to what.
---
sonii
---
Very true and definitely something to consider. 
---
Luckily - for most items it will work out the same no matter what.  The edge case items became completely irrelevant after the normalization change (like the Barman shanker for rogues for example). 
---
So as long as you follow that damage range rule you’ll be fine - but what you said is definitely true.
---
Some people have fun by pulling big numbers. Just because it's something you dont care about doesn't mean its not somerhing other people have fun doing.
---
well, at the time he says that he was killing vermin and workers... outside the cave... so the undead starter quest area is actually harder... hmm, interesting... 
---
aggroing like 4 spiders and dieing in the starter cave is a right of passage, rofl
---
Why does this somehow make me happy if not even emotional to some degree?
---
Esfand is good if you are looking for an all pump no dump stream also gachi when the sun goes down HandsUp
---
Definitely.  WW axe might be a level 30 quest but good effin luck doing all those elemental kills at level 30- they hit hard and do a lot of spell damage (bypassing some of your defenses) and you're also in a contested territory at least 5 levels below everyone else.   It's also no picnic to go to STV and get all those items from the trolls 4-6 levels above you. 
---
Not rushing WW axe makes sense unless you have a level 40+ buddy and you plan out all phases of it.  Personally I just bought the elemental drops from AH (was less than 10g even on the crazy inflated pserver economy) and I did the trolls kind of early by finding questing buddies in STV, so by level 33 I was ready to turn it all in and do the Cyclonian fight.  That power spike is so fun =P
---
staysafe is an amazing streamer but he plays alliance which sucks. Venruki and Esfand are really good players. Snutz is also very skilled. Joana is great too.
---
Tbh, sleep, and get healthy now. 
---
You're going to need the IRL boost.
---
It might be hard unless you prove yourself along the way. This game is allllll about making friends. Be cool to people as you level and be good at what you do and you'll probably get a dps warrior spot. Just be ready to tank when needed though, especially when raids are just getting started. You'll have more leeway when guilds get more established and content gets on farm.

I really really really don’t think Asmongold or anyone like him could get themselves educated at this current time.
---
The only “big” german streamer that plays retail at the moment is ungespielt. Not sure if he said anything about classic.
---
It's conjecture, but I genuinely think that day one of classic will see at least 500k players. Possibly more. And if they're planning on using a comparatively small number of servers (as they seem to anticipate a dropoff in population and don't want to have to merge dead servers later) then that number of players absolutely requires some kind of phasing.
---
Asmongold is a laid back streamer the issue is that people don't like opinions
---
When are you gonna give it to your favorite streamer?
---
Hi, /u/AggressiveEagle
---
Because I've been there, and done that. I used to main tank / offtank for a BWL/AQ guild and had rank 13 pvp back in the day. I know what it takes to be good vs. being subpar.
---
I mean, if you wanted to play it super safe... no. But yea, then you'd have to find extremely good players and each one would feel like a heroic
---
Spent way too much time on here last night.

---
Tribe and monkeynews sounds like your fit
---
They were not the most OP in raids.
---
PvP? Yes they absolutely crushed.
---
But circle of healing holy priests were the best raid healers and paladins we're the best tank healers
---
The pre-15 mage food you can eat gives about 10 hp/s, heck even the level 15 mage food only gives a few more hp/s than the extra spirit. Warriors get a ton of regen from spirit.
---
Oh okay, didn't realize he was a healer, that would explain the small sample size of what I saw.  Thanks for the background info
---
This is even dumber than the OP's
---
Monkeynews and Sonii
---
Based
---
Yes.
---
These two has been my late night entertainement for the last couple of weeks. Absolutely the best guides/informative clips on wow classic on youtube.
---
&gt; So technically wow will be brand new to me
---
It will anyway. The world you will see when Classic launches does not exist currently outside of the Beta and private servers.
---
You had 20 FPS when you turned Fraps capture on? Lucky
---
Yeah but raid progress would be off limits
---
Asmongold seems high strung as fuck, not laid back at all.
---
Absolutely. Having that axe in your early 30’s is insane. Critting for 500 damage with a white hit when mobs still have less than 1k health was a good feeling. 
---
It was also a blast in PvP when classes like rogues and mages had been used to you being a free kill and all of a sudden you can legit 2 shot them with lucky crits
---
I can't get past first ad :(
---
Highly doubt there will be hundreds of servers
---
i like how you left off tipsout for a skilled list :)
---
Lollll that guys a complete tool. Im pretty sure op said a chill warrior. Not some sperging out rage case
---
That's exactly the same thing as the above comment said. Why do you think saying the same thing again is going to make me respond differently?
---
KingGothalion talks down to people far too often to be as popular as he is.

This is the kind of thing I'd like to be tweaked so guilds don't have to run ZG forever just for enchants.

That was on a pretty sophisticated machine back in the day.

Something like the above video was not achievable in 2004. We’d crash in two seconds.

Wholesome

Good bot
---
You will see...
---
I want to undead mage but dwarf is life so think i Will have to go priest 
---
For khaz modan!
---
On my server (magtheridon EU alliance) we always spammed furors compendium of dragonslaying. I dont know why we were such snowflakes to this day.
---
It’s all about convenience. UC is a pain to get in and out of. By zeppelin from Org, you have to drop down, run across the field, through the ruined city, down the tunnels, wait for the elevator, and done. Even by flight path it’s a pain because of how windy it is and long it is.
---
Not sure why more people don’t go to TB though, it’s a nice city. The flight path from Org is only 50c and it’s not much longer than the deeprun tram. As I remember, ironforge and stormwind often has a pretty even distribution of people, not sure why it’s different for TB and Org
---
For sure.
---
He's laid back in the fact that he doesn't kick people out of chat unless they are being legitimately toxic even if the behavior annoys him it let's it slide maybe he states his distaste for a certain meme but unless it's something serious damaging its fair game
---
Everytime i played on an rp server i rarely found any rp.
---
I was there in the WoW beta in 2004. In 2004 and 2005, most of the players were genX.
---
Tanking in Vanilla is not comparable to tanking in retail AT ALL.
---
Tho a lot more action/interaction throughout the leveling. It will take you longer to get to 60 than 110.
---
Despite this they were both still dungeons. Long journeys frought with death and failure.
---
you have the reading comprehension of a gnat
---
my bad, sarcasm doesn’t always convey super well over the internet
---
Geared warrior will berserker rage, live through deathcoil, intercept, and kill the warlock in a few hits. Once deathcoil is down they're running through you and pummeling your casts you never got off anything but instas. Maybe the warrior dies from dots if he doesn't have enough buffer to survive through eating after the fight. I know from experience.
---
Hey, is it just me or does it smell like [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker] in here?
---
I’m upvoting you but know I hate you for this
---
114 Armour? Look at how they massacred my boy...
---
You'll figure it out. Worst case scenario, roll both and see which one you like best by level 20. It doesn't take long at all to get a toon from 1 to 20 and by that level you should have a pretty good feel for how the class will play. You will have access to deadmines by then too, so see how each performs in that dungeon and use that as the yardstick to see what you find more fun.
---
There is also r/outside
---
Not going to sleep until I get Broken Tooth upon release. Come @ me.
---
Yea I’ve experienced it. In the stress test there’s more interaction than retail
---
Or go where they are and camp them to death, and not allow them to level or progress
---
I can't access twitch at work.
---
Is the thinking to unveil all corners of both continents in the future?  I have not played in almost 10 years so i can't remember what it looked like before Cataclysm.  Did they make every spot on the original 2 continues accessible?  Or were there parts still grayed out on the map?
---
It's when Elemental Shaman, my main spec, became accepted as viable for PvE content. It was a lot of fun being welcome in raids for a change. 
---
I recognize as well a lot of aspects of the game went south at that time, and I hated being glued to Shattrath so often. I remember that aspect feeling just acutely wrong to me at the time. Dailies were also a terrible idea, turning much of the game into an un-fun time sink. 
---
If they implement TBC eventually, I hope it focuses on the dungeon and raid assets, the EotS BG, arena, the class revamps for hybrids in particular and enhanced variety in the loot table.  Leave out dailies and additional levels, which add banal grind and eviscerate vanilla content.
---
&gt; Additionally - the amount of strength required to shave off an entire attack (such as killing a mob in 8 hits as opposed to 9) is usually very very high and not easily obtainable if you are leveling at any decent rate. 
---
This makes sense to me, but
---
&gt; A good portion of your talents rely heavily on crit and the synergy is huge there. 
---
This does not. Flurry is the only Fury talent that explicitly relies on crit and you don't get that until 35-39 and then you respec Arms. What do you mean by this?
---
In original vanilla, I was in a guild of like 15 people with 4 RL friends.  It was fun but it was really hard to get stuff done.
---
I’ve got two questions that are my only source of warrior hesitancy:
---
1.). What are some ideas on gold making that people have for warriors?  My only hesitation is the ability to make steady gold.  Doesn’t have to be a lot, but decent enough.
---
2.). With a pre BiS warrior at level 60, how much downtime eating/bandaging would a warrior of any/each spec have fighting mobs in the 55-60 range?
---
I want to be capable of farming NPCs out in the world because that’s fun to me.  But if it’s like the instant 60 server where I had some decent starting dungeon gear, I was having to eat after each fight and that wasn’t too fun.  (The mobs seemed to be scaled weirdly and with no accuracy to a normal mob.)
---
I do think it's time to raise the cap streamers or no
---
This is so true. people expect to log into these server and be frustrated, degraded, down before you're done. Rejection, depression, can't get what you want. you ask me how I make my way you ask me everywhere and why. You hang on every word I say but the truth sounds like a lie. Live to win. till you die. Till  the light dies in your eyes. Live to win. Take it all. Just keep fighting till you fall.
---
I figure if I’m leveling with a hunter we should blow through questing since they’re god’s of leveling so I might go through w it
---
Esfand is entertaining and plays good music while playing. He's also knowledgeable about the game. I hardly ever go on twitch, but I found him to be enjoyable to put on.
---
Ya rly...
---
On private servers you could do it it before 40 as a human easily. However the reputation values in classic beta are way different than anything we saw on private servers. Its about a 50-60% nerf across the board. I would say its pretty hard right now, even as a human if you did every possible nelf quest 1-60 idk if you would be exalted by 60, probably not. So will require lots of grinding marrowgrane/cloth turnins
---
Oh I dunno. So far they really haven’t tried to take advantage of the hype by streaming anything Classic related 18 hours a day.  /s
---
The simplest way is buy a tabard for that faction as early as possible and wear it while you grind levels/dungeons. It will take a while though. But as are most things in Classic, if you work for something you will feel super cool when you get it.
---
Asmongold is pretty good.
---
As user majds1 once said:
---
&gt; You're an amazing bot /s
---
Although I reckon Ion was speaking generally rather than specifically, if say a big popular streamer server was still overcrowded as phase to begins I’m sure blizzard might make exceptions but they would obviously tell the community so that the steamer can get upset that it’s his/her own fault.
---
Listen to the guy man. Private servers are these days known for making dungeons and raids much harder than they originally were and people still farmed them in pretty short time  frame with proper group and without wiping. I truly believe, doing dungeons will be very easy to this reason and you will clear most 60lvl dungeons in matter of 30-45minutes
---
I've always been a pvp type of guy. 
---
Moreover, I don't think I will raid that much (unfortunately I've very little time to play weekly from 5 to 10 hours). I'm actually looking for a "casual" european guild that fits my playstyle and time.
---
For these reason, I'll do enhancement! But definetely will try restoration too if I've the chance.
---
Asmongold is garbage. The only reason to watch him is if you find him entertaining.  Don’t watch him for skill.
---
I believe it was an interview of Omar and Ion by Tipsout.
---
It's "evil" because his few minutes of peace will cost hundreds if not thousands of people several hours of gameplay.
---
I just got my beta access, my warrior turned level 2! 
---
I don’t even know how to stream but if you’re looking for laid back maybe I should start haha.
---
I’m pretty good at video games overall, but the idea of stance dancing and the warriors kit is a little worrisome bc I’m not too great at a lot of actions per minute builds where you push a lot of buttons in quick succession
---
If I wasn’t so lazy I could write up a horde 30-40 guide that’ll help you group many quests. But you have shimmering flats, hillsbrad/alterac  (new quests open up around 30), STV (you revisit this place a couple times), arathi, and desolace. I personally hate desolace for horde though, what a pain that place is to get to given the location of the town.
---
The quest chain for the Scepter of the Shifting Sands was long and required immense dedication to complete. More than most could or would be willing to do.
---
It required grinding Brood rep off silithids (you could even deputize people to collect items for you, the grind was so intense), multiple runs of BWL including a 5 hour speed run (might can get everything you need from 1 BWL run if you get things perfectly lined up, but I’m not 100% on that), and killing multiple world bosses that required raid groups (10m on some, others needed 40).
---
This took weeks of effort, funneled into basically just one person (since many were disinclined to grind the rep, and many guilds didn’t want to do all the world bosses/events multiple times for multiple people).
---
All of this was done while the rest of the server were contributing to the war effort with the repeatable turn ins for weeks.  Some servers didn't have particularly progressed guilds, so the turn ins were done and ready long before someone could actually acquire the Scepter to open the gates.
---
Too true man.  Too true..
---
I mean it’s literally the easiest pet to attack, a lot harder to get underground if an enemy force attacks.
---
They aren't even launching with the same number of servers as the vanilla launch.
---
7 days to die. Finally doing navazgane map (970 hours played).
---
I don't think Tabards worked like that.
---
I'm going to have to unsub from this reddit. It's just making me sad i'm not in the beta test.
---
I don’t think I was really clear with the point I was trying to make. I’ve always aimed for BiS and full raid prep. If I make it to 60 and can fit a raid schedule around real life I’ll do the same as I always have.
---
But the sub is full of people asking ‘which race is best for what’ and I’m sitting here thinking just fucking google it? You don’t have to have played a private server to read what they have to say. Even if the scaling and proc rates aren’t the same as live a lot of their theorycrafting is relatable.
---
Plus the racials aren’t magically going to make you top the charts. They’ll, at best, pip you above someone assuming you’re in exactly the same gear and throwing down identical rotations.
---
IDK I’ve been downvoted to hell so flood the sub with all these mirrored posts. I’ve already unfollowed it’s a cesspool of elitism and an echo chamber.
---
I didn't take it as an attack, nor was my post an attempt of brushing off your opinion. I don't understand why it's hard to you to grasp that even if you haven't experienced a specific situation yourself, doesn't mean it doesn't happen.
---
&gt; and then enter in your own as objectivity? 
---
I didn't try to present my opinion as objective... I said I was going to put my personal experience as an example that it DOES happen, even if it hasn't happened to you.
---
&gt;  I, who plays a fuck ton of retail, would have never known the two "biggest" streamers of wow were on the same server that I play on. 
---
Yeah, I already said on my previous post that realm sharding MIGHT have something do you with you not being able to frequently see the same faces around... But... It doesn't really matter, does it? For the third time, the fact that you have not encountered and/or regarded any of the described scenarios, doesn't mean other people haven't nor does it render it impossible for you to experience it in the future.
---
Was tabard rep a thing in Vanilla? (I didn't start until TBC)
---
I don’t think anyone cares if someone doesn’t min max. 
---
The biggest butthurt I see in game and especially on this sub is when someone who doesn’t min max what’s to be bleeding edge and then when they are told “no” because they don’t min max like that bleeding edge guild expects - they rush to the forums to cry and elitists. 
---
I have never seen, not once, an elitist go out of their way to make fun of someone for not min maxing. It just doesn’t happen. The worlds are so disconnected that the interaction just does not happen enough to matter. 
---
What I do see is people getting mad when they are not picked for a raid because of some min max issue. 
---
Casuals can make their own raids. They can make their own raids that ban anyone who is a min / maxer if they want. 
---
Not a single elitist is going to care. 
---
For as much hate this sub seems to feel towards min/maxers - it’s the casuals that demand the same treatment as a min/maxer that seem to be the root of the problem. 
---
This game has been solved for the most part (although I’m sure new micro metas will emerge with classic) - you know what you are picking going in. 
---
Don’t roll a ret paladin when you know they are trash and get mad when you’re not treated as if you’re a warrior. Etc. 
---
Don’t be stupid. Nothing wrong with going ret. nothing wrong with telling people to fuck off because they don’t like your choice. 
---
But there IS something wrong with bitching about someone else not bringing you to a raid because of a choice they have every right to make as well.
---
I like tribe and method Boys are starting to stream
---
Nice!
---
Undead mage is a classic tho :P
---
Yeah its a nuke spec, youre right - its one of their best for pvp. From what I remember a whole lot of locks eventually went SL to stop the powerspikes in later vanilla that physical dps got with better gear. Im talking from 15 years ago since I didnt play private servers and even though SM/ruin is a nuke spec, DoTs are still a large part of it.
---
I just mean DoTing is a an acquired taste and not everyone finds it interesting, as a Warlock you better make sure you enjoy that aspect.
---
It was not.
---
To me, amazingly unfun. Which is weird, because I liked pokemon. I guess it's just too simple. Card games can have a lot more depth.
---
Yup!  Pre-order at our website at www.bridgetonowhere.com
---
Gratz dude hope I get in too lol
---
Maybe burning legion? It’s unofficial Polish server since vanilla I think. It used to be called “kurwakebab”, because many Turks were also found there, but nowadays I think it’s mostly Poles. I don’t like it and I’m saying this as a Pole.
---
Here is what you do
---
You make a female character
---
You strip all your armor and weapons
---
You go to major city
---
You find mailbox in major city by the bank
---
You jump on the mailbox
---
You type /dance
---
You get gold...
---
i reeeeaally want to get my old character names and they're incredibly common words so i'm trying to be first in line when we get to reserve names early... but i really don't want to end up on a big streamer's server either. roll of the dice i guess, oof
---
I'd go ele or resto for pvp. Enhance is a melee class with poor mobility, though two hand wind fury is fun it's to random to rely on
---
Tabard rep wasn't added until WotLK.
---
I remember turning in shit-tons of runecloth in vanilla and TBC to unlock mounts.
---
Well one has leprosy so there's that..
---
I don't think anybody is saying it's mandatory. It's helpful, and if you're a raider you're probably already busy when logged on getting prepared for raids or actually raiding, so to be able to speed up skill on a new weapon is not without merit.
---
they don't it was meant as 'your pet' is another source of an interrupt and a stealthed cat does that job obviously better. Hence why the scorpid is only a duel pet
---
Speaking of carrying pugs for a win, i'd probably vote in druid high there. 
---
Some of the servers i've been playing on, there were 2 druids especially that could easily carry an entire team as FC. Because they knew exactly all the jump spots, how to kite half a bg solo without needing help. 
---
Granted they were also pretty well geared. 
---
(Hi Moonlotus, Fubbzy)
---
Mage would come close 2nd, they're especially good as mid gatekeepers, ccing the living crap of the ppl trying to cross. 
---
There used to be an awesome clip of a mage montage doing that, but i can't seem to find it, perhaps deleted due copyright or something. It's a shame tho, cuz it was great. All he did was kiting the ever living crap out of mid ppl while his team could easily keep getting flag and getting it back. 
---
And ye, rogue is pretty boring for bgs. Only fun time imo is in AV where u can sneak past chokepoints to ninja bases. And that way keep atleast 5-6+ usualy of opposing team recapping it all the time + spending time trying to find you. It's pretty fun.  
---
WSG/AB not so much tho, esp in a premade. 
---
For premades i've always liked priest the most, always wanted and brings alot of stuff to the table. Such as offensive dispells plenty of heals, bubble, great buffs, and can put out decent dmg when needed. Pretty versatile for bgs.
---
heres a upvote
---
1. Fishing, Tradeskills (mining/herbing/alchemy,) reserve tanking runs. Most groups have a hard time finding tanks, and if you're a good one (even if you're not prot) you can make reserve runs such as 1-2 Righteous orbs in live strat, or rich thorium veins in dire maul. If you're good you can also duel people for gold.
---
2. Eh, not that much really. Warrior's only real need for downtime is their life bar. You'll wreck most non elite mobs as arms or fury once you have a decent 2 hander, and you'll kill slower but lose less life per encounter as prot. Understand that pre-BiS is specific to RAIDING, so your raid gear might not be optimal for farming. For instance if I was farming and was specced fury, I'd put on stamina/str/crit gear and throw on a 2 hander. Pre-BiS typically is lacking in the stamina department in favor of damage stats.
---
My wife took her NElf hunter to the barrens back in the day to tame a gold wind serpent. She named it Kinki because they are constantly humping the air. She would frequently sexually harass our guild with Kinki humping them. Good times.
---
My bad, keep getting old/new racials confused, my bad thanks for the correction.
---
I hope they go PVE but if we end up on the same realm, yes I will attack them. who wouldnt want to gank the most popular player on the opposing faction? What is this? war of lovecraft?
---
I want to avoid their server if I can. If they keep it secret and I end up on their realm on the opposing faction it will happen.
---
Josh from Countdown to Classic is even coming North America, and he’s Australian :)
---
Could you give some insight on what makes good main tank? What are the things one should look for in order to become better? My main has always been a rogue, and I'd like to main a warrior this time.
---
Melee classes scale incredibly hard with gear but without access to raid gear shadow priest or disc hybrid is your best bet.
---
The floodgates are open, we will get at the least all pre cata xpansions as those are the ones that people will remember most fondly, what with the world staying as it was and original quest chains mainly being intact as they were at launch. We need to have this mindset so that we can make sure that any additions or methods of implementation at this point don't go to far. Don't forget we were never getting this in the first place, and it looked like we weren't going to change the phases at the start.
---
Been a while since I laughed out loud at a reddit comment
---
Didn’t know u could tame pets higher level then urself ? On private servers I received a msg it isn’t possible iirc. Only same level or below
---
I was thinking that the other day like. Why can’t current servers handle this
---
What if you could have flying that wasn't too fast and still kept you relatively close to people on the ground who had a way to dismount you? Fucking people can't even try to be constructive about something that has so much potential, and was implemented kind of poorly.
---
Haha yeah. I got my fall and spring swapped for posting
---
I was going to go with the shield+fast dagger flametongue weapon. Pull with flame shock into searing totem and just wail away at the mob as my mana regens. Let my lightning shield dish out some damage as the mob wails on me. Heal/Bandage as needed.
---
Ahhh, Paul Oakenfold - that swordfish OST was so good.
---
It's always ends up 50/50 most of the time
---
And you can't predict any of it
---
I never said he's skilled
---
I mean a group of europeans made servers run with 10k players in starting areas more or less lag free.
---
I think there's like an old machina of this kind of deal don't remember what it's called
---
The best ones have personalities that can compare to some of the beat radio personalities or podcasts
---
can you explain the wand part? Im new to that, AS in what makes a wand good stats or actually using it?
---
Yey
---
I saw videos of Soda playing online casino and the dealer, after seeing his hand wasn't good, did on purpose to make an "oups, I forgot to scan a card and I already scanned the next one. oh well, cancel the hand!" and then gave a blink to Soda when he wrote something the chat about the situation.
---
The warlock, on the other hand, absolute athletic FREAK of nature. Just a raw, carnal BEAST.
---
At some point you just need to grind. Typically I grind out 40-45 on humanoids because so many people bottleneck their first aid and you can make a killing selling cloth.
---
On behalf of all future TMvSS battles, we salute you, server guys!
---
On your serv wherever you were at the time, so must be true elsewhere for everyone... I know a shit ton of players and most are millenials. Dare I remind you that millennials/GenY are the ones born between 1980 and 1999, so ages 20 to 39. We ain't GenZ brother.
---
Same. $180/year isn't much money for most people, but it is for me. I'll stick with playing pirated single-player games.
---
Messaged you, my post got removed lol
---
You think you do but you don't
---
I like to go ele till elememtal focus then go down the enhance tree using 1h and shield. Then once you hit 40 and have rockpounder from uldaman respec to full enhance and down rank frost shock kite into the swing timer to save mana and health. Best way to level a shaman imo.
---
Duo DM:East or Strat living with a healer for gold.
---
Alliance caus I don't like living in mudhuts.
---
Resto druid hots can be applied along with renew. It's just multiple of the same spell don't stack. Even the renew from priest 8/8t2 stacks with regular renew because it is considered a different spell.
---
So at most the tank can have 4 hots on them. Rejuvenation, regrowth, renew, and GH renew.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but I'm pretty sure that's how it worked and will work in classic.
---
Yup that was me what was your name in the game?
---
&gt; Plus the racials aren’t magically going to make you top the charts
---
you really have no idea how weapon skill works if you think the racials are small. theres a reason taskmaster are basically the most expensive item in the game for pve
---
I was just messing around with my post wasn't trying to flame you or anything.  I know you can Google alot of this stuff but I think that's why people congregate here is to share ideas and bounce stuff off each other. I don't really see where the elitism is, it's the internet I ain't mad and sorry if it came across that way.
---
Healthstones!  I always give out candy if people are in range.
---
Unless you’re a hunter... then you can’t do much.
---
To give you an idea, in the Beta, as a human with the 10% rep bonus, I’ve completed every single Darnassus quest along with every single Alliance quest that gives Darnassus spillover rep and have only just reached honored (with both Darnassus and Stormwind) at level 18. If I were to use a more streamlined route, avoiding all quests that give no Darnassus rep at all, I could probably get there a few levels earlier.
---
No, if you are dungeon farming, it saves between 3-6 minutes each. 
---
This multiplied by gph makes a massive difference.
---
It just feels odd that the leader of a race would be stowed away in the deepest depths like it’s a dungeon.
---
I follow the rule of ABE in classic.
---
Always Buff Everyone
---
If that's your plan then I absolutely encourage you to try it out. It might not be the fastest or most optimal path, but if you get a rush every time you build a house\* and chew up every mob in a 30 yard radius, by godspeed do that.
---
\*When my brother used to play a shaman with me in dungeons and I was tanking, before big pulls I'd tell him to build me a house, which meant put down all four of his totems.
---
I'd love if there were a mix.
---
Admittedly I've never run TBC dungeons during their heyday, but going through them now in retail it's almost painful how linear everything becomes after classic. Like you said I don't mind the occasional linear dungeon, it's nice to have the option to run something simpler when you're short on time, but variety is best. 
---
If we could have that mix of labyrinths like Wailing Caverns, linear dungeon like Deadmines, quick challenges like the Stockades and the one-room bosses of Onyxia, all with enjoyable combat and the improved hybrid class gameplay from TBC... I'm all in.
---
You do realize that Druids are the standard flag carriers for WSG right? He's just doing what he's supposed to do.
---
The stream followers will probably all try to reserve his name, either to hold it hostage or (more likely) give it to him in exchange for discretion.
---
Humans want all other races, even their allies, extinguished. They’re the Nazis.
---
Night Elves are responsible for the planet nearly destroying itself time and time again. They’re the Russians.
---
Dwarves fight amongst themselves and dig shit up they shouldn’t. They’re the Australians.
---
Gnomes just make cool shit no one thinks is very useful. They’re the Swiss.
---
Orcs just don’t want to be slaves, to demons or anyone else. They’re the Black Americans.
---
Trolls just want a home. They’re the Israelis.
---
Tauren just want people to love the planet. They’re the Canadians.
---
Undead just want freedom and revenge against the Lich King. They’re the White Americans.
---
They can but Blizzard choose not to.
---
I like watching Mike Preach, preachlfw on Twitch. Though I understand he's not everyone's cup of tea. He's planning to roll warrior on Classic. I don't believe he's super active though. Like Asmon is on almost constantly.
---
He has a channel on YT also : Preach Gaming. Here's a link to a sample :

---
Weight of the world pulling you down!
---
It's much better than BFA, but not enough in my opinion.
---
Servers seem to lag heavily at like 200/300 players. This is not enough for AQ release or massive events and battles
---
1)  farm mobs and offer tank services for righteous orb reserves. Professions / playing the AH. These are the most popular methods. 
---
2) well pre raid bis you wearing a lot of leather. This makes you squishy af and it does lead to some serious downtime.  Pre raid is designed for maximizing dps - not trading blows with mobs It’s not uncommon to have an “open world pve” set that has some decent stats that are plate.
---
Swifty
---
I already respec'd your mom last night.
---
Given the evidence I think it's fair to say he's a better dev and visionary than manager.
---
I'm on the opposite side of this coin!  My daughter leaves for college 2 days before classic releases!  So unlike when she was 5 and I couldn't raid...now I can! :)
---
Trust me - as much as I'm happy I can raid - you have the better deal here!! Congrats! :)
---
&gt; A secondary question would be is it bad to level engineering as my first character?   
---
Yes, but not because engineering is bad, simply because engineering is hugely expensive to level up (regardless of if you collect the mats yourself, that's still stuff you could have otherwise sold). For your first character you're likely better off just getting rich off of gathering professions and being able to buy 16 slot bags then a mount ASAP.       
---
You can always swap a gathering profession for a crafting one after you hit 60 and buy a mount. While you *could* use some of the gear during leveling, you can also buy it using the profits from gathering, and then sell your crafted BoEs the same way at 60.
---
Yeah, I do from time to time. He has a big enough following that he can do some cool stuff (like taking a raid group to Kara and sneaking into the catacombs at lvl 30).
---
I hope you didn't spend 50g
---
I've considered going rp if there is an rp pvp server
---
Great point. How does gearing usually play out as a resto shammy? To specify, how hard is it to get pre raid bis, enough gear to PvP and be comfortable, and finally to get to the point where you can blow bitches up ;)
---
Also curious how casual friendly a shaman is in your opinion. Would around 10hr a week be sufficient to really progress as a sham? I just know that some classes take a large time investment for decent payoffs.
---
My understanding is the best ways to make gold as a warrior is Blacksmithing because even if you dont get lucky enough for the best recipe drops, the Ore sells nice and it helps to keep you in decent gear till 60 and if you do get those super hard recipes you can make a massive amount.               
---
And if your specced for tanking and geared I have seen Warriors sell themselves to groups trying to fill for the higher end dungeons (Scholo, ST, LBRS) but with Classic being brand new I dont think there will be a large market for that until at least a year from now.               
---
Thats the biggest downside to playing Warriors is they have a much harder time solo grinding mobs and the repair bills are insane.
---
TBC I took my lowbie Orc hunter to Azuremist Isle to get a ravager. Still have him to this day.
---
Getting the engi net as a hunter is pretty fun, and the damage reflect trinkets can be very useful vs a mage/warlock as they literally just nuke themselves.  It's like you see them casting fireball and are like 'lol, here's an auto shot + multi combo' and then the fireball is reflected and all the sudden they are *SAD PANDA*
---
I never thought about that. 
---
Alot of people have been saying alot of the experience will be dulled because of the access to such modern apps. The internet is a different beast than it was then. 
---
But from a community standpoint i didn't think about how such things will be spread and shared. How it could really improve the social experience. 
---
Back then alot of things were hearsay, rumors and such that you only heard about and on occasion saw. These things became legends and stories that would be repeated for years. 
---
It truly was a testament to the older ways of gaming. 
---
The best you got back then was some low-res video, sometimes with music and some cheesy default intro/outro 
---
How far content production has come as a whole, more available and easier to use. It's exciting to see what will come.
---
Lmao what?
---
Fucking gandalf ninjaing the loot lol
---
No reason to fix it? A CC-immune pet is extremely op. Probably not what the devs intended
---
Yes, I'd like to discuss Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker.
---
The problem imo with expanding classic with new dungeons and raids is that you spread a playerbase thinner and thinner. If they add one or two more raids, it'll get harder and harder to get MC or BWL groups going.
---
It's kind of a balancing nightmare if you truly want to keep all of vanilla somewhat relevant.
---
Thunderfurry Combat Rogue... I can dream.
---
&gt;who wouldnt want to gank the most popular player on the opposing faction? 
---
Me. My guild cleared the first half of AQ 40 in our progression then the TBC announcement happened and the guild died. I'm here to clear AQ4 and Naxx, don't give a single fucking shit about right clicking streamers.
---
&gt; even as a human if you did every possible nelf quest 1-60 idk if you would be exalted by 60
---
According to a rough calculation I've done with private server data, I would not bank on being exalted at 60, even as a human, even if you did every quest in the game at appropriate level, even with spill over rep
---
Gandalf, the Mage-Hunter.
---
Hi, /u/Kurah00
---
Isn't their some epic rider sabre tooth you can earn through quests without even needing the riding skill? Really wish us hordies got our raptor equivalent. Love the Unarmored Raptor without the ball on the end of it's horn.
---
Most streamers are west coast right? Am I safe in assuming that most east coast servers should be safe?
---
He said he won't accept trades until he gets his epic mount.
---
You might also take a look at https://www.twitch.tv/zeroed_tv
---
Shattered hand I played as well, had plenty of Dutch people as well, many people transferred to frostmane tough in vanilla
---
They're brutal in wPVP.
---
In open world pvp, hunter would have an easy fight.
---
Going into this thread I would say this is my exact opinion. Now reading all of these comments, I think that resilience made it really hard for players who don't PvP daily to enjoy PvP. You felt gimped versus people who spent the majority of their time in-game PvPing, getting deleted while doing minimal damage.
---
I do still agree that you should have some sort of edge over the PvE focused players if you're a PvP-er, but it's a tough line to tread.
---
You don't want to alienate those PvE players and stop them from enjoying PvP as well (thereby lowering the players enjoying and queuing for BGs), but you don't want to frustrate the PvP base because thats what they love about the game, and they shouldn't get heavily punished for not committing to raiding weekly.
---
Both PvP and PvE require time investments, and you should get appropriately rewarded for the time spent in game. This thread hasn't swayed my opinion in terms of resilience = wow killer, but whether the optimal route be increasing stamina on PvP gear, or a lessening the amount of resilience, or making resilience reduce player damage taken instead of crit chance/damage, who knows.
---
You want everyone to have fun playing the game, but you can't make everyone happy. You can't give everyone the same gear but you should be able to get it close enough so that it comes down to pure skill (and class ofc) when 2 players meet: one with 30hrs/week playing PvP vs one with 30hrs/week playing PvE and raiding.
---
Hurr but you'll never find a single person that will acknowledge you as a fellow human being if you play (insert class spec here) deeerrrr
---
&gt; This would prevent the chaos from even happening
---
All other opinions aside, if people want to find them (and people do) they will. Matching /who information with what is on stream isn't hard to do. Let alone when people start mass whispering or running up to them to verify. 
---
Hiding your server as such for a little bit won't really prevent chaos for a significant amount of time.
---
The WoW devs have talked about it many times now. It's because in BFA for a given class there's tons of different procs/effects/interactions in your talents, traits and gear that all combine to make combat very taxing for the server per character. 1 deathknight attacking is probably the same as 5 vanilla players attacking in terms of calculations and procs.  
---
So for a server 80 characters all fighting at once is no problem, but 60 BFA characters will bring a server to it's knees.
---
That'll be awesome as well I would def play on a rppvp server over regular get to fight some alliance why semi rping it.
---
Isn’t it odd how over the lifespan of wow it become that little more rush to the end, hardcore must raid and we all stopped remembering everything that was once an achievement? I remember a friend travelling from ironforge to stormwind via wetlands to dustwallow to booty bay just because he was a muppet.
---
You enjoy that bear dude!
---
Two of my favorite videos.
---
His point about earning a piece of gear and it being recognizable are why I like transmog. Wildstar did it the best by giving you every appearance of every gear piece you have owned (including alternative quest rewards that you didn't take) in a library. You then could make multiple sets, color the different parts of different pieces, and even use appearances from gear on other characters (even stuff you cant personally equip. This meant you could make tons of different, well matched armor sets from all the different pieces of gear you had found (without needing to store it).
---
Give links or download info?! Got a discord?
---
The problem is that your numbers are more for "experienced party" than a decent one. Hell, I've done UD strat runs on live that take an hour because people don't understand what's happening.
---
For what it's worth, I quit playing WoW in 2007 because of how much I hated BC. Flying mounts ruined world PvP and the new continent was really disconnected from Azeroth. It made me feel like the previous years I spent playing the game were completely meaningless.
---
Only real language in Belgium is Dutch mate.
---
I bet you a bolt of linen cloth that he has the connections to get his name if it gets "stolen".
---
I love the idea of standalone Vanilla, TBC, and Wrath servers. You mention splitting the community. I’m not sure we need millions of players to make these servers work. Even if we’re not talking millions—let’s say 100k people interested in these classic servers (this is including the three pre-Cata expacs), that is more than enough people to keep the game interesting even if half of the population quits or plays intermittently. There’s so much content in those expacs to keep people busy for over a decade, I believe. Just look at Guild Wars 1. Plenty of people are still playing it 14 years later. The idea of horizontal progression is interesting, to be sure, but I worry about it’s unintentional impact on the game I love. It’s delicate. I am not, however, a supporter of progression servers.
---
&gt;vanilla servers weren’t that bad
---
Oh man, I needed a good laugh this week and that did it right there.
---
Did you play in Vanilla, specifically during release? I think the server I first rolled on was down for like 2 consecutive days after multiple crashes.
---
the line is drawn with actual collusion like what happened with the mafia
---
there was actual proof too, I still remember the first whistle-blower lmao
---
I was proud of Anal \[Not In My House\] when they added achievements.
---
I was also 14
---
I have had Frost's stream on in the background while working these days, it's so relaxing
---
Not Chuck Norris, but another action star:
---
Bob saw Terry Crews.  Bob gave him some nasty insults.  Terry broke Bob's neck.  Bob has died of dissin' Terry.
---
Filthy wrathboi
---
I think it was anub'arak or something along those lines, something nerubian sounding.
---
I'm pretty sure they were writing Cyrillic. Anyway, what nationality they were doesn't really matter, the point is just that there were absolutely communities forming around realms where you could find yourself as an outsider on your level 60 character if you're unlucky.
---
But we don't know what realm sizes will be, or how many. The more players there are spread over fewer realms, the less likely there is of a server becoming "the X server". Even in vanilla they had a whole bunch of realms toward the end.
---
The whole point of layering is that they don't want to spread the playerbase (that will rapidly go down in numbers at the start) over too many servers, so I have high hopes.
---
Unless what I’ve been reading is wrong it’s .12% chance to hit more for each weapon skill exceeding the boss’ defense.
---
Your entire point was 'good looking gear'. :P
---
nah. he's too salty nowadays
---
Play WC 3 while waiting for classic, gives you a feel for everything
---
So 15 years later we should still be having to run MC every week?
---
No. It’s ironic actually. The fury/prot hybrid is a MT build for if you are raiding with world buffs. It makes your warrior into a potato in any other situation. 
---
You just spec normal fury dps spec (or with some very minor tweaks). Every guild will be slightly different about loot, but you should get an equal share of fury loot, and the prot loot after the pure tanks have it already. 
---
Raid Bosses require a variety of numbers of tanks. Some need way too many to have that many prot warriors. So you dps the bosses that need few tanks, and tank the ones that need many. As just a normal fury dps spec. 
---
If you you are MTing a 20man, or filling in for a tank that is absent, then you would spec prot temporarily. But not some autistic european-style hybrid spec. Just normal prot.
---
Obviously I'm not talking about launch.... The servers got upgraded a lot through vanilla
---
Crying over a game. Are these real comments? Or are dudes really getting so emasculated.
---
If you're a melee then you can pick up the thrash blade quest for Mara at 45. That's what's gonna get me from 40-45 on my rogue.
---
Never seen the guide you're talking about, however I have seen some guides that recommend leveling as BM until you can get Aimed Shot, then respec to Aimed Shot so you can practice weaving, and then continue to spec into BM.
---
he was 100% big but nowadays the focus is on method so I doubt he'd the same following, specially with his saltiness when people mention the difficulty of current content..
---
I suggest watching all  beginner videos from youtube user tjustsoup. Good start for new classic players.
---
https://youtu.be/4mkoMQO4EP4
---
It’s in darkshore, used to be the first town you went to as a NE after leaving Teldrassil but in cata it was destroyed, now on retail currently you go to a new village further up the coast called Lor’danel
---
That makes sense, guess I’ll also have to find out what server streamers are gonna be on lol
---
makes really dumb tweets
---
Wait now hold on, this is genius!
---
The biggest difference between a good warrior and a bad is knowledge of the pulls and willingness to tank, I've known a lot of DPS warriors who flat out refuse to tank and they are frowned upon as much as a non-healing Druid.            
---
It's not that a DPS Warrior is bad, they have great number output but a Warrior who refuses to tank is just a plate wearing rogue and theres enough rogues looking for spots as it is.
---
BFA has a different heart beat/tick and more calculations going on.
---
I've always loved 30-40 as healer. I run dungeons endlesly with holy/disc spec and gear out my priest for 40 when I respec into shadow and start melting faces. 20-30 has always been the worst for me.
---
I want to be a Tauren with a gnome that rides on my shoulder lol
---
&gt; Crendor is the king of fluff content,
---
Inb4 another pointless Top 10, the quality content of Crendor.
---
Wipe Club is another one that existed on literally every realm.
---
Ive been searching like a mad man for the interface files. The files Ive found so far are terrible and contains only cropped screen shots.
---
Hope you find what you look for or can extract them urself.
---
Good luck with your project mate.
---
Literally splits the game into two pieces. Holistically and simplicity is what retail wow is missing. 
---
You can still get great gear in pvp for pvp in vanilla wow. But the best gear should be achieved with multiple aspects of the game. Not just grinding 24/7 killing others. Makes each piece critical and meaningful in a singular manner.
---
That’s how I feel at least.
---
Cool story
---
honestly this comment just shows you don't know pvp as well as soda, not a dig at you because thats all he knows tbf
---
if there's one thing soda will do really well is pvp
---
uhm, sorry to burst your bubble but a bunch of private server amateurs can handle much bigger loads than this. 
---
Wow classic is incredible in many ways, but server capacity is not one of them.
---
&gt; Also if you know your viper sting is going to get dispelled instantly you can downrank it to save mana while forcing the healer to keep using globals dispelling.    
---
And burning more mana than you used to boot!   
---
 - Viper Sting (Rank 1): 135 mana    
---
 - Abolish Poison: 16% of base mana (200 mana)    
---
So if they leave viper, they lose mana, if they remove it they lose mana. Win/win.
---
Sigh. Here we go again. Round 3. Fight.
---
Yes his streams are great! I learn so much about vanilla watching him, I came into the game on the tail end of BC and I'm excited to play the classic.
---
Just. Fucking. Stop.
---
I don't know the answer to most of your questions but if i remember correctly its 25 quests max.
---
Read the link.
---
Whats the fight?
---
I could see alot of streamers saying what server they were going to play on then make "secret" characters on different servers they will actually play.
---
My main has always been a priest, and I would heal anything. It's levels of fun doing RFK or even SM as a 60 just because the trade channel spam never ended. So I'd burn some time helping them out, and I got to play the game even more. Everybody wins.
---
Warlocks are quite vulnerable to purge, and I believe they can purge SL off of the pet on pservers. IDK if that will work in Classic.
---
Is that the one that puts the ! And ? All over the map?
---
My Big fear with post Naxx content is what happens to pvp? 
---
Mages in naxx gear reach levels of damage in PvP where just one shatter combo can kill its equally super geared counter parts and their survivability in the frost tree goes bonkers. 
---
Locks are equally as oppressive in PvP. One full corruption Amp coa and siphon life will be lethal. 
---
Fury warriors with so much damage and crit that they don’t need healing debuff. They just sit on you for 5 seconds and if you don’t have all your cds You are dead in seconds   
---
The list goes on 
---
So how can more raids with even better gear not be a problem? Bring in some kind of resilience? Then it is No longer the same game. There would have to be changes or the gear could no longer be upgrades. Just side grades with different set bonuses.
---
Yeah, I'm hella rusty on all the details of vanilla.  Point is, my guild is run by moocher streamers who use fans to carry them.  The rest of the guild is awesome though.
---
You’re right i’m not very knowledgeable on pvp, it just became boring really fast to see him go back and forth from each flag room and then start jumping to get in weird places, when anyone who watches him knows he watches a lot of old PvP videos which weren’t the same as his content. I get it, it’s his job, druid isn’t mage or rogue, etc, it was just dissapointing and became quickly boring
---
Y'know I didnt try triple triad on Ffxiv for the longest time. Didnt think I'd care for it. I just collected the. Ards cause why not.
---
Oo boy was I wrong. 
---
Now I challenge every npc I can. Cheating bastards the lot of them but I like it!
---
How did jogger survive the guards? 
---
Also how was this photo taken? I’m so delightedly confused!
---
Vanilla is not even out, yet you cry out loud about something else that is suppose to come after IF it even happends? Dafuq boi
---
I guess I will believe it when I see it.  All I know is this: with group finder, just finding a group could take a long time.  Given it will be a new server, there would be plenty of people looking to do stuff, especially early on.  But even still, your class could hinder your acceptance.
---
30-45 minutes?  Besides for maybe DM north, I don't see how it would be possible to clear something as big as LBRS and BRD in that time frame.  Between eating and drinking and people still needed to cc and ff targets.  Unless you are telling me that things are so easy this time that you could just aoe tank and aoe clear stuff, then I just can't see it.  Those instances were massive with a lot of roaming mobs.  It was so easy to pull extra groups back then as well that it was pretty much instance wipe for getting an extra unexpected mob.  Especially something like LBRS.  To get the quest done could and unlock all 4 pieces of the key, there is just no way that takes 45 minutes.  Place was too massive with too many tight knit mobs that easily pulled each other.
---
Again, I will believe when I see it.
---
^ Why is this upvoted, promoting that private servers saved wow and are the one reason classic wow is here will only fuel this lie and worship of them.
---
most if not all low level quests will exist in phase one right?
---
most of the stuff held back intentionally will be related to whatever content is being held back which is end game things.
---
Let's give it a year or two before we worry about new content.
---
Rogue isn't too terrible if you keep yourself in good blue weapons by knowing the dungeon quests to hit up. You can generally keep yourself healed through first aid alone and keep eating to a minimum. Blade Flurry is on a 2 min cooldown, so you can pull an extra mob every 2 minutes, you can even pull 3 mobs pretty easily with evasion + bf. Once you get adrenaline rush you can start pulling 5+ mobs every 5 minutes with rush + bf + evasion. If you do that while continuing to fit in multi mob pulls with bf while you wait on the next adrenaline rush then the mobs start falling quite quickly.
---
One big thing you’ll notice as a warrior in vanilla compared to other iterations of the game is that you will be expected to tank at times. Especially if you are in a raiding guild that is even remotely seriously as they will gear down the line all of their warriors with tank gear.  If you ONLY want to dps and you want to raid seriously - play rogue. It’s a similar play style and you won’t be required to tank. 
---
Just something to think about. 
---
Other than that - showing up consistently is 90% of the game. I promise you that.
---
Ok, you very clearly lack any comprehension. Have fun with the rest of your day after this block.
---
Because a private server can make wow but silly old blizzard with all their resources and money can't apprently.
---
Insert "burn it" meme here.
---
That CCG idea is so good. The Inn being a hub for ranked play is such a great idea and is something that they could add post-naxx that really adds fun alternatives without changing the game.
---
Yeah I feel it’s far easier in vanilla. However, the time requirements is exponentially higher
---
You're turning me on now!  Wanna get together and trade brojobs?
---
Raid of raids: 
---
3 tanks 
---
9 fury warriors 
---
13 mages
---
2 locks 
---
1 Druid 
---
6 shamans 
---
6 priests
---
Since I have no idea what the "cosmos Ui" is or did as an addon, I couldn't tell you :D
---
But in a more general sense: There were addons back in 'ye olde days or yore, with such capabilities.
---
PvP gear progression is good, however putting resilience on it makes PvE gear irrelevant and weak for PvP purpose. This makes people choose to be either PvP or PvE instead of just doing both. (unless you are grindy grinder and you keep up doing raids, BGs and arenas weekly) Removing resilience from the game would solve the problem. Flying ruins the game and should be removed as well. I dont think I need to explain why. BC design was great character-wise. They still felt pretty unique, but also smoother and more interesting. As for the map design, this is where the main difference between TBC and vanilla lies imo. TBC had great, challenging content and improved gameplay, but the original feel of open world, that vanilla offered was missing. I believe the main reason that people are looking for new classic content instead of jumping on expansion train is to keep the Azeroth alive and therefore keep one of the main pillars, that made WoW so great. TBC literally destroyed this aspect of the game and it offered inovated but 3-legged table instead of 4-legged table that we had in vanilla.
---
But what if the streamer is on your faction?
---
Isn't that beneficial.
---
I can't stand their animations, posture and movements. My "character fantasy" is the character being this super human athletic freak. Humans just look clunky as hell.
---
Right. But im not comparing classes. Im just talking about mages.  And I stated mages do more than spam frostbolt
---
Lmao I did the opposite in vanilla! Made a dwarf, journeyed all the way to mulgore for “The Rake”
---

---
Look at this, it's not crashing with hundreds of players.
---
2H WF is the ultimate 'roll of the dice' spec. 
---
You'll have more crit% than this with good gear, but for easy math lets assume with 20% crit chance you get the following chances (approximately).  Windfury is a 20% chance to proc as well. 
---
Regular swing, no crit (no WF, and no crit)= roughly 70%
---
Weapon crit, single attack, no WF = about 30%
---
WF triggers, no crits = 20%
---
Wf triggers plus one weapon crit = 12%
---
WF triggers plus two crits = 4%
---
The fabled WF triggers and they all crit (AKA the *wf triple crit*= 0.16% chance (about 1.6 out of every thousand attacks)
---
Now with better crit% you will be pushing 25% or more, so your chance will be better, but that WF triple crit is a rare beast to see in the wild.  Though it will often mean a total one-shot, so there's that!  I might be off with my numbers too, near the end of the workday and I might have messed up this math.  But it feels right to me based on my experience. 
---
I have a naxx geared Enh shaman with might of menethil (strongest 2h mace in Vanilla).  I one shot people, and then I sit there and do ticklish damage for another 15-20 sec until I get more procs.  It's a very fun playstyle once you get the insane gear, and it's fun before the insane gear too, but I got sick of making the 'right play' but relying on RNG to bail me out.  I got bored with the spec and moved on.
---
No worries, I don't normally watch Cdew but I do think he deserves a bit of "respect" for lack of a better word. I recently checked out his youtube channel and his new classic videos are actually really funny. Maybe give those a shot as well?
---
You can’t loot a chest while in combat, and your pet attacking engages you in combat IIRC
---
Challenge modes were a solution but they dont seem to come back in bfa
---
I figured as much, but I've seen guides mention quests for the Argent Dawn, Cenarion Circle and Thorium Brotherhood in the mid-50s which would start to complicate things.
---
Was literally gonna leave this exact upvote, have my comment.
---
You need to calm down.
---
Download from Github the database populate script for a pserver's game data (which includes quest). Create the database using the populate script. Query quests from database, filtering by start zone, rep gains, etc... some of the numbers will not be accurate but you won't find better anywhere else outside of Blizzard HQ.
---
Maybe it was morphed into the Darkmoon Faire cards?
---
Obviously you’re not playing a game with them, but you still have to scour Azeroth to find the full set.
---
I spent my entire time in the demo from Blizzcon just buffing people with Fort.  I plan to continue buffing random folks once it’s live.
---
She got her riding mount out of it, that's for sure.
---
Warrior is one of the hardest classes to level to 60 (if not THE hardest). A lot of your competition will fizzle out on the way to 60. Raiding guilds will also run multiple fury warriors because they provide some of the highest dps in the end game
---
wouldn't it make your life easier to have all the idiot fanboys and clout chasers leave your layer?
---
I'm excited for everyone who never got to experience it. I wish I could wipe my memory and start all over.
---
After taming this bear I decided in classic launch I'm going with a white tauren!
---
Yeah that's what I normally did as well
---
Not going to hate on that.  To each their own.  There’s no way to please everybody when populations get as big as the WoW player base is.  For me personally, TBC was the best the game ever was.  And I know I’m not alone with that opinion.
---
oh I see where you're going wrong - Beast Lore armour values are incorrect and will always show 3731 for virtually every boss, no matter the patch, and are independent of the database values. The leaked figure is the correct one, as it was in 2006. I don't think I can link the nost forums, but there is no way to accurately access armor and spell damage data for mobs without the codebase, the closest being the database leak from 2007/8.
---
You going to have epic mount 5min after dinging, or is that a goal u have?
---
But most of the responses are to people asking the question:  what is the best race for [class]?
---
I was Gibz. Joined when you guys were attempting Twin Emps. Dwarf Hunter.
---
Friend, no idea how to break this to you, but the vocal minority is you, and all the other people crying for changes. Classic is turning out to be success on the level of pre-sliced bread, and it's precisely because there are no changes to the content.
---
I have a one-track mind. Lol. I did not remember to get my weapon training In uc.
---
not my type of streamer, and that's ok
---
It was a joke at the expense of gnomes
---
The assumption that classic will warrant new content is extremely optimistic.  
---
Yes, Classic will have a monster opening.  The private server people are for sure to stick around for a while.  But I guarantee you, a lot of retail players will go right back to retail within the first week without question.  A lot of people coming back for the nostalgia aren't likely to stay past their first initial sub.
---
Of course, Classic will have its following.  But will it be enough to warrant additional new content after the intial timetable?  Who knows.  Way too early.
---

---
Oh phew.
---
If you honestly think the vast majority is in agreement on *anything* regarding classic I feel like you havnt been on this sub very long
---
For wondrous amazement, why people flock to this game.
---
Though I've spent the bulk of my time on Horde (never alli til Panda), I'm starting to lean towards Alliance for classic.  Will feel newer, get to level up in totally different zones, different race flavors, etc.  And Gnomes have great racials so it works out well that you like em.  What's probably going to seal it is if I do end up maining druid at launch, since the animal forms for druid look ugly as hell.
---
Hopefully his bug report helps them (n)arrow it down.
---
How I see it is, you could 2x your pets damage or increase yours by 20%. In the end buffing your pet will do more damage. You can still practice kiting w.o marks.
---
........I never specced BM in vanilla, was always marks, and always got passed in PvP by BM hunters lol. BM would also beat me as marksman 1v1 in PvP till the higher levels.
---
BM is better pretty much all around at lower to mid levels.
---
Survival is fun too 😀
---
They both look amazing. 
---
You really cant go wrong either way.
---
some twitch fanbases are an absolute cancer
---
I mean, my point is just that 'get gud' is not an argument against transmog because even when you're decked out in late game BiS most classes are still gonna look like some monster out of game of thrones.
---
"I'd work all night, if it meant nothing got done."
---
Hi, /u/Battle_Addict
---
It's such a good idea especially the Inn's for ranked play. Just another case of what could have been.
---
death*
---
layering won't be there forever and it will also be persistent between login sessions, so no it won't be like rotating servers everyday
---
&gt; theres a reason taskmaster
---
You mean edgemasters
---
Is that true though? They can use mail and leather too so in the end they have largest potential loot pool.
---
Yes you can :)
---
Exactly how I feel about me "hey it's ya boy"...
---
Instead of balancing, just pop up a server that will actually change. Leave classic alone, but pull all human resources away from it. Problem solved.
---
I think OP's Schrödinger's streamer fetish is cooler.
---
Our guild in vanilla was always at a solid 10 people +/-8 
---
Meaning these folks were usually always on at certain times of the day, also meaning that anything that needed done, could get done. On the rare occasion grabbing a pug or two, but that was WoW in a nutshell. Those of us still in contact have been planning out what we'll be doing once classic drops. Not for just nostalgias sake, but for the sake of us just wanting to go home. These past years we've been playing D2 loads, and it's kept us in touch gaming a bit more. It's still not WoW and we know that. 
---
Not to mention, that guild being as tightly knit as it was, started my priest habit. Rolled a rogue initially as per usual, and we tended to have trouble getting a healer. So I said fukkit, and rolled one. 4 priests later, it's safe to say I was hooked. I had my alt tank and a hunter just to change things up a bit. So it wasn't all heals all the time. Also wayyyy before dual spec, hence the multiple priests.
---
Means he'll have the Ahn'Qiraj event for himself so your guild won't, if other faction gets wrecked you will get the longest queues in PvP cause of low pop on the other side, I mean, you can find more than one issue for sure
---
Best way to make transmog work and still obtain that "earned" status is by not raising the level cap and doing horizontal progression so the content is still challenging for the most part.
---
I also had a WC snake named Trouser. My buddies were confident Blizzard would ban that one. Still have him as well.
---

I think you missed a couple, or more, zeros there.

As a horde hunter I'm going to travel here to stop and see the dam on my way to tame a dwarf bear. I'm stoked.
---
Couuuuld be, I'm from EU so I wouldn't know !
---

---
D..d...di.... DICK
---
I was just simply stating a fact, never said you did.
---
Oh it's this thread again.
---
Its for tge glances not tge hit or crit
---
&gt; You do realize without layers youd be on a different server right?
---
Not sure why people keep trying to peddle this narrative.  It's been discussed a thousand times and the short answer is that it's not true.  At least, it wouldn't have to be if other realm archs were pursued in lieu of layering.  'nuff said.
---
Yeah I remember you good times maybe we see each other in game if you decide to play classic.
---
&gt;Creating new content for Classic, modifying TBC, etc., would undoubtedly be the "not safe" route; although, it would be one that many people would love to see. 
---
Absolutely. As one of those that would like to see it, I think it is incumbent upon us to make the case by re-envisioning TBC in a way that would only add to vanilla and subtract nothing. That is a tall task, but where there's a will, there's a way. 
---
For starters, some no-go elements from TBC and beyond are pretty easy to identify now that we've been down the expansion road so many times:
---
* Flying
---
* Daily Quests / World Quests
---
* Additional levels beyond 60
---
* Class homogenization
---
* Automated group finder
---
* Over-reliance on quest hubs
---
* Mini-map quest markers
---
* Dearth of class specific content
---
The "bad" part with just the foregoing is that TBC zones would need a pretty fundamental redesign. The "good" part is no one who prefers Classic vanilla would object to the removal of the above from TBC content. On the contrary, re-purposing zones for class specific ability acquisition could be a novel and fun way of introducing some character progression absent actual leveling. This concept balances the need to preserve the relevance of vanilla content while allowing for some RPG faithful character progression from the new content. For example, a warlock may embark on a class quest series tracking down some grimoires from the orcish warlocks native to Shadowmoon Valley (Hello Felguard). A Shaman may journey to the Elemental Plateau in Nagrand to bond with the elements of another world to enhance his abilities (Looking at you Wrath Totem). 
---
Would really love to get people's thoughts on re-envisioning TBC.
---
They won't be able to hide what server they're on. People will watch the stream and /who their names until they figure out which server they're on. It will take minutes. A couple of hours tops as they start to pull ahead and they can be identified by their level. Or simply find them in-game.
---
In my opinion, two skills that would be completely foreign to someone coming from retail to classic would be threat management as well as stance dancing.
---
Threat management is huge as juggling aggro on multiple mob pulls is a challenge. You need to be able to quickly swap between mobs to build threat - the old phrase “wait for three sunders” exists for a reason.
---
Stance dancing is IMO the best way to distinguish the quality of a warrior. In every fight (PvE and PvP), there will be an opportunity to use stance specific abilities to make things go smoother for you. Being able to do this effectively will be huge to your overall performance
---
No one cares.
---
Yeah what a good guy he is, aiming to help out classic!
---
Ahh shoot that wasn’t a very good one lol
---
Got mentioned once I'M GOOD
---
Not her epic mount?
---
Thats a bad idea. It took them 5 years to develop classic. If we are going to get new content after Naxx based on some "Classic Constitution" They need to start planning it now. Not saying they need to develop it now but, they do need to plan.
---
Gods be good, Barnabus was the Bain of my existence then by sheer luck he was mine.
---
That is definitely an interesting question, and one I have literally nothing about. As is, transfers didnt come until WAY later into Vanilla.. 2006 iifc.
---
curse of tongues, spell lock, deathcoil, chain fear, and infernal should prevent that
---
My favourite is the pandaren one
---
I'm just as excited as you to play the content that has been confirmed. I don't need anything new for years to come. The real thing I don't want, is TBC. I loved TBC at the time, yet I want to stay in Vanilla and keep playing Vanilla for years beyond Naxx without the only alternative being fresh servers.
---
If it's painful at all you shouldn't do it
---
I heard arms was the main dps spec early in original vanilla, why would that be?
---
People like to watch people play games. If it's not for you, then so be it. It's not hard to understand.
---

---
For real, Guild Wars 1 level cap was TWENTY and yet when you made an alt you never felt like you were irrelevant at level 13 or 14. They never raised that cap and there was an entire world of content. 
---
Keeping a consistent level cap and making new content without making old content completely irrelevant and avoiding the power creep is a good thing to strive for. It will be extremely difficult to pull off and I just hope Blizz puts in that effort for us because I will pay them forever if they do.
---
We would’ve gotten along. My favourite pet was my WC snake named Trouser. My buddies thought Blizzard would ban that one for sure. Still have him as well.
---
Idk about Warriors against double void sack and like arena grand master trinket or whatever.  A rage pot isn't going to fix your problems.  The rage starvation is real.
---
/r/woweconomy
---
Might be that the first few times when people are new and not very geared. That will smooth out eventually, especially when you run with guild mates and preferably using Discord. 
---
Just sitting there chilling together running a few Strat live runs for Righteous Orbs and potentially a Flask/Truefaith recipe :) Much better than the feeling off mindlessly banging your head against the wall you get while doing other types of farming on your own. But that's just my opinion!
---
Keeping flying mounts and allowing flying in all zones in my #1 wishlist thing. I have played since day 1 vanilla and my least favorite thing is walking my lazy ass everywhere. I know all the zones and all the quests within the zones, I really don’t need to ride around on my wimpy little ground mount to experience what the game has to offer. Just my opinion though.
---
Litteral god
---
It depends on what content you plan on doing at 60. If you’re going to PvP with 5 mans, then you will be fine tanking with an Arms build.
---
I didn't know that Dracula made WoW guides... #SUBBED
---
Grats!  
---
Also, Aspect of the Monkey and Ice Trap...
---
Here is why this will not work.  Blizzard was against classic because of the division in resources and teams to support to wow games.  Bug fixes, servers, etc.. 
---
To do this they will have to manage classic, current, and now bubbles.  It will be less profit for more work where most people who play classic want no changes.  Changes is what got us to where current wow is today.
---
the warrior will be rage starved from double void sac
---
* Chuck Norris is BiS geared by default.
---
* Chuck Norris achieved Rank 15 in PvP and still holds it.
---
Yeah. It doesn't matter how hard someone campaigns on this sub or tries to spread whatever propaganda or gameplay philosophy supports their "you do you" memespec dreams. No one who matters will change their minds about what can pull its own weight and what can't.
---
Everytime I see these "You can play whatever and however you want and still raid naxx and get an invite to a PVP premade anytime you want one" threads I can't help but roll my eyes. It's like when a teenager says "Guys we can all have world peace, just everyone stop fighting and love each other." Naive.
---
Yeah, the dad's giving his son a sugar addicktion and diabeetes, how pleasent. Whoever made this comic is a dolt who promotes bad eating habits and should have his comic closed down.
---
Any measure that introduces intra-server decohesion into an MMO is in the "worst option" category.  That includes phased content, sharding, layering, etc.
---
On some small servers, maybe. But most of the time, the scepter was ready to go as soon as the war effort was done. If your server has even 1 guild on it on either faction that pushes to clear content the only time limit will be the rep grind and maybe 2 lockouts of BWL. By the time we got AQ going on my server my guild would clear MC Ony BWL and ZG in one night, so the 5 hour BWL 'speed run' isn't really an issue. They could, theoretically, have everything but the rep done in a single 7 day period (requires 2 runs of BWL). There was a single US server with 2 Scarab Lords, none in EU.
---
Forums subreddits, Discord servers, got to reach out and find all these places because people are talking about it everywhere
---
Every time I hear Remedy by Seether I am reminded of questing back in Felwood with my undead Warlock.
---
is he different from the other white bears in dun morogh?
---
Blizzard just announced we're going to the Moon after over a decade of begging and simulations and you're all wondering when Blizzard is going to take us to Pluto. So yeah, fucking stop.
---
Not too sure about that. I never quested in Silithus or Winterspring in Vanilla, and I levelled many chars to 60. It’ll be fairy easy to save 2-3 areas for gold questing if you really want to.
---
That moment when people don’t know the difference in lag and shitty dps.
---
the rogue clip only worked because of pserver bug letting him dispel SL off the pet
---
I think, they should leave classic where it's at, 1 year down the road or 5 years down the road. Give us the option to play it whenever. Maybe release a couple new servers every so many years that start over with MC only raid and progress up (Like we are going to experience now) but maintain current status of the existing servers so players don't lose days and days of progress.  
---
As far "new" content like burning crusade and WoTlK. if classic takes off, maybe release a BC option where you can port a character over to "Burning Crusade Classic" and take off like it was a new expansion release, keeping original classic still live.   
---
This company can literally continue to make millions off of content they already published and not give us anything new and I'd still pay to play the old game lol.
---
But if WoW is an engaging game, with new and engaging content, people will make alts, new people will play, and leveling will always be relevant. 
---
Seriously "leveling" is as much of an experience as raids are so much so that even in the Blizzard-published WoW guides a perk of warlock and hunter is that they are "good at leveling." 
---
WoW was out for like, several years before I stopped seeing people at low levels and that was only after dungeon finder and heirlooms.
---
Addons are all open source by necessitation due to them being just .lua scripts, and by policy from Blizzard in not obfuscating the code of addons.
---
No.  While it's a small but not insignificant reduction to miss, parry, and dodge chances (.2% each, much higher than .12%) it more importantly reduces the glancing blow penalty.
---
Glancing blows happen 20% of the time and reduce your damage by 30% (iirc).  Weapon skill can mitigate that damage loss down to 5%.  
---
Without weapon skill that's basically a 6% dps loss on white damage, which made up a good chunk of your dps.
---
In short the one racial could be responsible for 2-4% of your total dps which is pretty significant.
---
I assumed people would be talking about it somewhere, just can’t figure out where!
---
&gt; PVPers are forced to raid to get better gear to pvp and likewise for pve players.
---
I remember this being a pretty one-way exchange until TBC introduced resilience. I know lots of people here take issue with how it was implemented, but I still think that was one of the few positive changes the devs made with that expansion. Queuing up for a BG only to get roflstomped by some jackass in tier gear (who often didn't play much, if any, better than I did) was bullshit.
---
Raid gear should make you better at *raiding.* It should have absolutely no impact on your performance in PvP. The same is true of the inverse.
---
Yeah nobody cares.
---
No it's not it's way better and had way more players then retail does and you couldn't play it for free. The optimists are the ones in retail wow thinking that shit won't be in the garbage a year after classic drops. Retail is a bad game unless you wanna do Herioc keys. Everything else is a joke. Thats like asking someone to read a book series that sucks until book 5. Sorry bro you lose most people halfway through book one. That's retail right now. It's just a pile of shit with some good sprinkles at the very top. After you've clawed your way through piles of dung.
---
Favorite: gnome Best: night elf
---
Depends on how much time you want to spend in M+ on retail.
---
MOST punchable? Have you seen Asmongoloid?
---
Any evidence that it's a bug?
---
Thickets
---
Yeah, and it's shit, and so is the game you play the cards in. Hopefully Blizzard would have come up with a less annoying ecosystem for an in-universe card game.
---
That's cool.  You going to do it all again when it goes live?
---
Female dwarf has the best casting animations in game.
---
I think its only 20 quests in log, updated to 25 in TBC.
---
Thanks, good work
---
I know josh from countdown to classic is doing a priest but he doesn’t stream much... not many druids to my knowledge
---
It’s ok they do get +15 which means they level it super fucking easy.
---
1. Push all realms to TBC in no fewer than 24 months. Give Vanilla-diehards a free chance to transfer to a few servers that won't get TBC.
---
2. Do the same for WotLK in another 2-3 years.
---
That's all I want.
---
Sounds like a good time to me.
---
Seriously it's one of those "fuck it was awful but damn do I miss it" memories.
---
This is very nice. I think it would've been great if they just kept this functionality for Classic instead of removing it to match old vanilla client, but of course.. as always.. addons to the rescue to shore up Blizzards poor UI design. It's stuff like this that made me the addon whore I've been since vanilla XD
---
I'll agree to disagree on that. They have over a decade worth of assets if they don't want to develop new ones. If they do, they could still hold it off until the game has been released and players are responding. 
---
Keep in mind a fair amount of the playerbase either doesn't want new content or doesn't trust Blizzard to not screw it up. 
---
We're finally getting the game that we've waited over a decade for. Why is everyone asking about post-naxx content? We haven't even gotten to touch classic as classic yet. Sure, new content could be fun if done right, but it is in no way guaranteed, so don't go into the game expecting it to be developed. 
---
If the idea of "just" classic is -already- so stale that you need more content, maybe it isn't the game for you.
---
All add-ons are open source, just download the add-on and look for the LUA file

Bounty hunting was definitely a thing back in the day lol.
---
Pretty sure they will all be there. It's only the AQ and Naxx specific ones that won't be there that typically aren't that useful for levelling that won't. I very much doubt they'll content gate the extra hubs that missed the rushed vanilla release into phases.

Having no quests to do 48+ isn't 'authentic vanilla experience', it's just dumb.

 Was literally gonna leave this exact comment, have my upvote.
---
Background: I played mage in vanilla, missed TBC, played warlock in Wrath, fire mage in Cata, Shadow Priest in MoP (hated the mage 100 talents), Warlock/SP/Mage in WoD, Mage/Priest in Legion.
---
I'm tempted to play mage again but I really feel like I should try experiencing things differently this time around. I'll be playing ally leveling with a friend who is going warrior. Leveling ease/speed isn't a worry as we'll be taking it slow. I feel like healing could be really interesting and possibly even ideal as we'd have the hardest to find components of a group for all 5 player dungeons. Would like to be viable for eventual raiding, fun playstyle without being completely overwhelming, able to pvp and make some decent gold (never got my epic mount in vanilla, spent it all on pvp/pve gear/pots/repairs). If not healing I'd go DPS, tanking is higher stress than I'd want. Leaning towards human as race for the diplomacy racial as there's multiple reps I'll be wanting to grind. Classes I've been mainly thinking about are priest, rogue, lock, mage, druid but I'm back and forth a lot and the list keeps changing.

Ummmm...what?
---
I swear if you r/whoosh me..
---
&gt;Flying ruins the game and should be removed as well. I dont think I need to explain why.
---
Extremely subjective. I personally have no issues with it and can see the benefits in it.
---
&gt; but the original feel of open world, that vanilla offered was missing 
---
Also fairly subjective. Sure, you're more confined but that didn't stop Outland from being incredible to explore. It's also a pretty massive and dense map considering the development time of it compared to the original continents.
---
They already had one of the devs talking in a video about possible content post Naxx, if the game goes well. Anyone who ever played classic knows. The sleeping giant is about to wake up and beat the fuck outa every other mmo with it's 100ft long battle club.

Was told Staysafe has a video guide for being exalted with Darnassus before level 40.
---
As a horde mage I went to undercity a great deal (because of the regent vendor, tailoring trainer and clothier for repair all really close to the teleport location) and so I have to say that you do get use to running around the city.

I do the same thing as a dwarf/night elf and Mazzranache

I remember every time leveling up as a mage in vanilla, I would check all my spells to see how much they went up :)
---
Again. If you like easy and convenient. Play retail. That’s what easy and convenient gets you.
---
It's the worst designed city in the game. It's also one that horde has to spend a lot of time in due to being the only horde city in eastern kingdoms and so close to the plaguelands.
---
sure. 
---
Patch 1.9.0 (2006-01-03): Can no longer be dispelled off the warlock. In addition, Soul Link can no longer be used on non-demon pets.
---
There maybe one lol.
---
It was possible to purge SL in retail vanilla afaik, but you had to target the pet rather than the warlock. Since that's usually a felhunter... good luck getting the spell to land
---
Xaryu, Payo, and Cdew are the only ones I can regularly stand that I have found.
---
Not in the beta but yes that is how it was supposed to work, usually warlocks macro in a pet follow command into their drain soul for this reason
---
I agree with this, but would add that particularly with racial it's a subjective thing and despite being "figured out" there is still a lot of debate that goes on.
---
For example, best horde race for warrior in PvE tanking?  Or even PvE DPS?  Best alliance hunter race for PvP?  Etc. 
---
Different people have different opinions, and even though I think some of them are wrong people still discuss it if they value x trait over y.
---
Female dwarf with the double long braids... you look like a fucking windmill while casting.
---
Nice. Liked the video. I plan on playing a NE Hunter.
---
They’re competing with all the other DPS Warriors to begin with, plus Rogues and Hunters for specific items like trinkets or weapons. While an individual warrior has a larger pool, in a raid with lots of Warriors each one has a fraction of that pool. So a Mage or Warlock is going to gear up much faster than any particular Warrior.
---
Was gonna literally gonna have this exact comment, leave my upvote.
---
yeah the issue is you have not way to close distance
---
I'm usually a Hordie but I want to be a night elf hunter just for that Shadowmeld+Aimed Shot
---
Xaryu is one the best mages around, constantly number 1 on retail. Wouldn't discount him.
---
Definitely not trolling.
---
The Tauren one.
---
Transmog removes an RPG element by turning gear into a "black box" of stats rather than a real, physical object in the game world. Old gear should be outdated, and people should be able to gauge what kind of character other people are by looking at their gear. It also encourages that awful mindset of cosmetics and toys collecting that retail WoW has. 
---
One thing that in theory could work is armor dyes. This way people could still customize their armor while still maintaining that fact armor is a real, physical part of the game world (which would still be plainly visible to other people in its true form as it should be). In addition, this could also to some extend avoid the "clown suit" effect people something describe when acquiring BiS gear by being able to color mismatching gear pieces to match one another, while simultaneously not turning the goal of playing an MMORPG into amassing a ridiculous amount of cosmetics, mounts, non-battle pets and other such nonsense.

Thrall would be an epic dubstep/ trap dj
---
It's the best city. If only it wasn't in the middle of nowhere.
---
I’m going PvP would prefer RP PvP but if they don’t have one I’ll just RP in my PvP server. Best part is my spouse is joining me (never played wow before) to RP together.
---
He's a troll account. Just downvote and move on.
---
There are only a few thousand people in the beta. There were 10 million players by the end of vanilla. Even if you were a day one subscriber, the chances of you being picked are vanishingly small. Get over it, it’s just probability fucking you in the ass!
---
Isn't feralas 40's?  I loved that place.  Tanaris too right?
---
As a dad myself, can confirm - I enjoy his rants. Tbh tho he’s planning his talks quite often. He just uses a lot of words to convey his thoughts. He’s also super cool guy.
---
that's way funnier than it should be
---
You'll level slower than a hunter in BM spec. Not having extra speed on Aspect of the Cheetah, and not having improved pet resurrection are big drawbacks with going MM spec.
---
&gt; A secondary question would be is it bad to level engineering as my first character?
---
This is the best thing you can do, as Engineering is the best profession in the game for serious PVE and PVP. You can buy Leatherworker gear from somebody else. Leveling with Skinning just to level 40 is something a lot of people to as well. They skin every beast they encounter and vendor it all to ensure they can afford their mount at 40.
---
between joining in gamergate harassment campaigns? destroying games here and there. Guy is a dumbass and I guarantee half the stuff hes saying is fake
---
That's assuming Blizzard took _no_ steps to reduce queues.  Dynamic respawns, to my mind, are far more authentic than introducing intra-server decohesion (the worst possible thing you can do to an MMO) by spinning up multiple instances of the game world within the same realm.
---
More concurrent players supported per realm means lower queues and a reduced need to spin up additional realms.  If you have to merge realms in the future, then so be it.  Better than decohesing the realm during its formative months.
---
I would say more. Like a 1:10 or more ratio. You can have 6 different azerite traits that need checked just I the first 2 tiers and that’s not counting talents, abilities and other shit.
---
Bingo. Hopefully someone around here creates a post for reference with all of the big names so know what to avoid.
---
Okay explain this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbINgb673JM&amp;t=15m20s
---
But there are certain shields in the game that help this like skullflame shield and shield spikes and buffs like thorns to help a pally tank keep aggro on aoe pulls in 5 mans so they arent as bad as people make them out to be if itemised and played correctly.
---
God damn it...I hope blizzard actually browses Reddit. The awesome ideas that flow around when people quit bitching is amazing.
---
Alliance are the baddies. Horde are just making the best out of a bad situation and want the baddies to leave them the fuck alone. Enough said.
---
isnt the best use of enchanting to be designated enchanter in dungeon runs if you can need and disenchant  everything? does this work in classic?
---
Stormx if you wanna watch some good druid pvp.
---
Really? So that's worse than having 1) too many people on a server, having it crash, being unable to level due to quests being camped by tons of people followed by 2) completely dead servers months down the road?
---
I think blizzard recognizes that long-term server community health is critical. With no cross-server functionality, being on a dead server sucks. 
---
WoW Classic is in a unique position where it's a game launch that will attract a lot of initial attention, but they're also expecting a huge drop off once the majority of people are done checking it out. 
---
Layering is the only way to keep a low enough server count so you end up with healthy populations in the long-term, while also allowing the game to be playable in the initial rush. 
---
I don't love layering and it's not perfect, but I don't see how the alternative of just not having it at all is better.
---
How is it at all better to merge realms later rather than sooner? Would you rather cut off the infected foot early and get it done with, or let it fester and get worse ? Easy choice
---
It doesn't really matter. If you have IRL friends playing, figure it out and play with them. If not, play whatever interests you most. There are good/bad players on both sides. The decision is largely irrelevant in the bigger picture.
---
Sooo I should choose alliance then....
---
So far I'm the only one from the guild on there. There weren't many of us. Maybe 30 or so and most of them were a lot older than me so I'm not sure if they would still be interested
---
Oh absolutely! And my 4 friends are coming with me in case any dwarves give us any trouble! Plus we want to see the Stonewrought dam together.
---
Not really true. I haven’t experienced lag free play on any pserver over 7k pop. One of the many reasons I didn’t play on nost PvP for long and don’t play on other pservers now.
---
When does sonii rage?
---
&gt;  those old never-to-be-used again characters on their original server will count as population and will effect how Blizzard recommends servers to new players
---
that is not how the population counter works
---
Isn’t 32 the most “quit at” level?
---
That's mostly how transmog works after the changes in Legion.
---
Honestly just being able to change colors of armor (via dyes) would be amazing, and avoids most of the complaints of transmog.
---
If you want to roleplay Nazism and have waifus with pointy ears, yes.
---
If you want to play on the side that has historically dominated both PVE and PVP, no.
---
Only 2 pure white bears. This one and a 12 rare. The other bears are grey
---
&gt; I don't understand why people decide to be completely naive
---
It's naive to think that people are complaining about it out of naivity.
---
Bajheera is one of the few streamers I can actually tolerate. He seems like a stand up guy.
---
I’ve read that it should be done by the second week. I’ll try and find it.
---
Yeah IRL friends want to stay on retail and aren't interested in classic somehow
---
This is what I loved about classic, as a hunter.   Going out of your way to find unique tames that actually meant something.   Also, remember to tame Echiyakee in the Barrens while you have the quest.
---
that video was recorded before patch 1.9 which made soul link undispellable. which is what my previous comment stated.
---
I haven't heard anything about Scarab Lord for Asmond, but he did say he wouldn't take anything from anyone until he had at least grinded out his epic mount.  I at least respect him for that.
---
Well GW2 has no progression, it's not horizontal, it's cosmetic. You do want progression, it's just a difference between small % increases (maybe 30-50%) and vertical progression, which amounts to exponential increases. The difference in power between level 60 and level 70 is many multiples.
---
Yeah I’ve heard the Priest is fun to use but I like being in the middle of everything so I normally main a Warrior Tauren or Rogue Troll because I Solo a lot 
---
But now that I know to join a Clan or a Raiding group asap to maximize leveling I may reconsider
---
A "fortnight" is two weeks.
---
If I was rolling a lock this time around, I would do this.
---
Have you watched the streams? Asmon/Esfand/SS is usually surrounded by a gang of fanboys guarding him, and if not they can call in about 20-30 people within 5 minutes to help them.
---
99% of them will go on PvP servers, watch.
---
there is zero chance blizzard will not let streamers take names first
---
Apparently if your aren’t a Nelf you need exalted with both Darnassus and winterspring trainers to ride that mount. Don’t know how accurate that is but I never got the mount so...
---
When you say historically you mean both EU and US?
---
WoW Icon 16x16 Patch 1.8.0 (10-Oct-2005): Percentage of damage split with pet has been reduced. Is now a spell cast on your pet that gives an aura to both you and the pet. This aura increases all damage caused by you and your pet by 3% and splits 30% of all damage taken by the caster to the pet. The aura will last as long as the pet is active, and the pet must be the target of a dispel effect in order to dispel this ability. Formerly redirected 50% of all damage and lasted for 30 seconds, but was dispellable.
---
I glanced somewhere that the community might organize thenselves and call one of the PVP servers RP-PVP.
---
That is, if we don't get the separation at launch.
---
I hope it's feasible.
---
It's okay, Hunters lost all their armor anyways when they cast Tame Beast.
---
I'm glad you liked it :) I'm working on a 1-20 guide atm for Gnomes. This guide will work from 12-20 as NE Hunter. So make sure to follow if you want to see more guides.   
---
Anyway have a great day.
---
I feel like one HUGE thing that people forget is that MILLIONS of people will play this game, if you are here reading these posts you are more prepared than 90% of the other players.
---
Gearing up in Vanilla is HARD! I remember having "blues" and "greens" for months before my first epic. Sure there will be plenty of hardcore players that will be crushing hours trying to be the first and best, but majority of people you will encounter will be complete ASS at their roles and easily out played regardless if you are the perfect race/class/and spec.
---
VW demonic sacrifice is never worth it over just using the VW's sacrifice skill for the shield.
---
Just wait an hour after launch. There will be a list here within the hour of all the streamers locations and then you can roll wherever you like. All you have to do is avoid the big streamers.
---
100%
---
Yes. Of the 39 raids ever released in World of Warcraft, 36 of them have been first cleared by Horde.
---
Wow dude your so cool
---
It's 5head, it means a high iq play.
---
Yeah because the assumption that males can’t cry isn’t an outdate adage of what a man can and can’t be. Please kindly go crawl back under your rock.
---
Seems like you didnt really heed the advise from OP. Ironic.
---
Your dad didn't level her enough for it.
---
We are going to work on that.
---
Pretty sure you can purge SL off the pet. You can on pservers - idk about Classic.
---
Well thought out answer and I respect your opinion about it, replacing it with more stamina seems like a good starting though
---
Wow thanks, very cool. The dudes just saying that people can and will play the game casually if they want to, people with any amount of time can find something to do on classic wow for the most part. What you’re describing isn’t even casual for most players.
---
coulda swore soda said he's going PVP
---
I dont know what skill level rogues you've played with but they have the ability to be very impactful in BG's. A very skilled rogue will do more for you than just guard flag rooms and nodes. They will CC 3-4 people at any given time and take down flag carriers
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-kYglKZ1f8&amp;t=128s
---
Cant compare tbc to classic. Classic is not accessible at all. That's the major reason for a lot of people wanting it back. Cata made it gone for good.
---
A seperate tbc server is o ly going to divide the player base which is already bad for an mmo. And a tbc expansion to classic still takes away classic.
---
In the end, it's better for everyone to have classic and let it evolve into it's own thing. How long before people start asking g for work servers or cata. Or mop. You can please everyone, so please as much as you can.
---
Yeah, someone pointed out to me that Paladin tanking, with the correct gear and spec, was being developed and theorycrafted late in vanilla's life cycle. 
---
Still not quite the same as warriors being able to tank literally every instance from 11-60 and not needing a prot spec until late game, but it's something especially among players who only care about endgame.
---
Yeah if they are running Felhunter it's a problem. But I think SL locks often run VW in wpvp
---
&gt; The issue is that vertical progression was almost an inevitability for WoW given that the only real means of character progression at level 60 is obtaining better gear. Gear resets/level cap increases were pretty much necessary, because with this linear system of character progression, you end up with players being heavily fragmented across progression levels. It becomes impossible to provide enough content to keep players engaged when Timmy hasn't even reached level 49 yet, Johnny just finished his first MC run, and Rachel has full T3.
---
It doesn't isn't true. Runescape proves you can do horizontal progression just fine.
---
From 1 to 60, you have the core leveling progress. Then you have so many raids, if you haven't done them yet as a guild, that's tons of content! Not to mention PvP, and eventually you'll get past Naxx and move on to the new content. 
---
You can also introduce new zones with new core questing, new crafting materials / recipes, dungeons, etc..
---
Dual wielding as fury is the standard / optimal warrior PvE dps. Using a 2 hander as fury can be viable too iirc, just not as good
---
Check out kargoz speed leveling videos on YouTube.  Loving his content.
---
New friends inc
---
Mark Kerns stream has been pure gold since the beta launched.
---
Ppl definitely buy gold on the server lol.  Yes tgere are spawns and timers. Are they blizzlike. Wasmt part of APES just some shitty ppl running mafia layer wasmt as hcore as them. Prices stayed high far after APES was done in Ungoro. 
---
Look I am not gonna argue with you about this its too speculative and I dont care enough. None of your arguments even seem to understand my points despite walls of text so not gonna talk in circles. We don't know what blizzlike devilsaur spawms are. We dont know if there will be more or less devilsaur relative to pop.
---
&gt; Honestly, it's not their fault, it is just the way it is.
---
they chose the streamer life
---
So all the good late 2handed weapons that drop, does any class or spec (not just Warr) use those optimally
---
so it's an act put on by an idiot
---
I used to not like him the  watched his souls games and honestly learned that hes an idiot, but funny as hell when you realize most of it is an act
---
I think it was at the expense of us who read it expecting a joke.
---
Esfand/Tips/SS are all rolling on the same server, avoid that server at all costs.
---
Now that is some serious determination. Grats on pulling it off!
---
I don't mind Arena's it's the prizes and the pressure to homogenize to bring balance that comes with them I hate. If they wanna add them so people can measure dicks. I'm all for it. Would for sure wanna give mine a measure too. That being said the prizes ruin it. This is an mmorpg not an e-sport. I don't really thing you can be both.
---
All of that being said. I am already getting what I wanted, so I wish you luck in your quest. Expansions for everyone I say lol.
---
&gt; This is pure speculation and you have shown me no data to prove me wrong
---
Because it's objectively a superior game? And proof, look at OSRS, returned to its roots and has greater player retention than retail version. Because retail for almost every MMORPG is garbage these days. Themepark doesn't describe it accurately.
---
The fact alone that you managed to finish the hunter pet tame questchain as a Tauren is an impressive feat by itself.
---
Not in Phase 1, we are.
---
Temporary dynamic respawns to support the influx would've been better than layering IMO.  Supporting more concurrent players within a single server means lower queues and less need to spin up new realms.  If server merges are necessary down the road (which, by the way, previously-layered realms are not excluded from either), then so be it .  Intra-server decohesion is basically the worst thing you can introduce into an MMO, whose _entire_ premise revolves around a _single_ coherent game world per server.
---
he may well have
---
Park a lock alt outside raid and SS yourself before fights.
---
That's why I agree that each expansion should have its own 1-60-*like* leveling pace. What it does is that it creates a deeper, richer world and helps players feel more invested in their characters' growth.
---
Vanilla content doesn't play well with expansion content because Vanilla wasn't made with that expansion content in mind.
---
I started in Burning Crusade and quit right after Lich King came out, then got back in for Legion. My heart sank when I saw how much the world changed during Cataclysm. Not just Loch Modan and Wetlands, but also Thousand Needles, Southern Barrens, Darkshore, Stranglethorn... Lots of memories shattered.
---
I'm so excited to show friends who started in Legion how the world used to be!
---
all I know for sure is asmon said hes going pve
---
The 1st MMORPG than I played was in 1996. Ultima Online and Everquest came after. Exclusively genX players. The MMORPG games were mean to play as not as today.
---
They haven’t announced server names or how many servers there will be yet. 
---
Once that happens, guilds will be recruiting and you can get an idea of which servers will be alliance or horde dominated. 
---
Also you can beware of streamer servers which will be fine one minute and then lag city the next, as a thousand people pour into a zone following their favorite streamer.
---
Smh.
---
DUDE YOU'RE IN EVERY SUBREDDIT WTF I SEE YOU IN r/greentext all the time holy cow
---
That+20 Stam buff is such a massive upgrade. Passing by a 24+ priest in early Ashenvale, STM, or Hillsbrad was always so great
---
Great ideas thank you!
---
A game should not be the reason you choose not to kill yourself; especially one you have yet to play. Seek professional help for your own sake and the sake of those close to you.
---
The point is: don’t quest just grind. 1000x faster
---
Aren't most of the most badass wow characters in the depths of a dungeon?...
---
Why does onyxia live deep into the cavern?  It's where all the best lairs are deep through the guards and labrynth.
---
"Stink Guard" is what got me
---
Awesome!
---
Once you get some gear you can go hybrid a bit. Builds like that are possible but you wont be particularly good at any of those things.
---
Yea not sure the only things I know about it. Are all based on Hordies crying foul and claiming the alliance gets a free epic rider. Which I doubt is true but, that's all I know. One change I need is we should get the Venomhide. Not because it's "free" but because it's a raptor who's horn doesn't have a damn ball on the end.
---
The exact reason you stated earlier

&gt;If they go PVP and I end up on their server I can def see my guild have a few nights dedicated to ganking streamers and ruining their world boss attempts.
---
Forget leveling guides. Enjoy the journey and the exploration.
---
Asmongold. He’s legitimately better than people give him credit for and his streams are entertaining. Plus, his game knowledge is on par with just about anyone else’s.
---
then just watch the archives. I never catch any of his streams live.

Hyjal was actually in classic. It was a mountainous area with a giant tree in it. Super beautiful if you had the chance to go
---
Problem being that "no transmog" has its own way of removing the RPG element of giving your character their own look.  I always dislike it in games where you could be playing e.g. a paladin, but the best weapon is a skull-headed axe so you look like a bad guy but are supposed to be lawful good.
---
Not saying transmog is great (in fact I don't like it at all), but some form of customizing your character's look (beyond the character creator) is also a great role playing feature that games all too often don't have.
---
i don't know where those patch notes came from, because they are not official blizzard patch notes for sure.
---
[here is the official 1.8 patch notes](https://web.archive.org/web/20070105103846/http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/patchnotes/patch1p8.html), which does not list that note.
---
also note that 1.8 was the patch that changed death coil, which the warlock in *World of Roguecraft* did not use to get the rogue off of him because it did not fear at the time of that recording.
---
&gt; I don't recognize former expansions as content in the latest expansion, it's not relevant.
---
Right, and that's the problem with keeping that old expansion content in the game as an artificial barrier to entry.
---
It also makes it so that the only meaningful content is only 10 levels of pacing. You can't feel invested equally in a character that only takes you 10 levels to complete than one that takes 60 *Vanilla-like pacing* levels to complete.
---
&gt; For instance in Vanilla, TBC, and to a lesser degree WotLK, all content from the beginning of the expansion was relevant until the end of the expansion.
---
Not at all. TBC content was completely disconnected, geographically and mechanically from previous content. In 1-60, max level characters inhabit and travel through the same regions as level 10s. 
---
Materials are more porous through the 60 Vanilla levels as well. TBC mats don't translate at all to Vanilla and vice-versa. 
---
Professions are also more cohesive throughout 1-60. TBC professions are completely separate from that experience.
---
&gt; honestly they just need to kill Azeroth and come out with WoW 2 or something at this point with a clean slate.
---
Pretty much agree with this.
---
Can't we improve upon classic instead of adding lvl 70, flying mounts, and a portal to a land I care nothing about...  Bring the improvement and dungeons and even some of the storyline to Azeroth.
---
In vanilla I bound ctrl and alt on my mouse to use for modifiers and rebound A and D to strafe then used Q and E for spells along with 1-7, R, T, F, G, Z, X, C, and V. Basically everything in easy reach of my left hand. Shift was used as a modifier mainly with the keys directly around the WASD cluster. 
---
Mouse-look (with RMB) is how you'll want to be controlling your character so the turn keys aren't needed. Q and E are very valuable for often used, quick access abilities.
---
I'd probably change that setup some now since I have an MMO mouse and a lot of abilities that aren't in my main rotation can get bound there, still recommend using Q and E for ability binds.
---
Staysafe is not good at all. 
---
Add Guzu to your list of Horde Rogues.
---
Add Xaryu to Horde Mages.
---
No but it gets boring/monotone. Rogues can mix it up a little
---
Two of your arguments for vanilla WoW having the hardest raids are the size of raid and lack of technology in 2004.
---
Everquest had 72 person raids in 1999. And wiping meant a rogue had to stealth in and drag everyone’s corpse out of the boss room. And there were no instances, so you were racing other guilds to mobilize and take down the boss, which was on a variable spawn time.
---
I could keep going, but saying that vanilla WoW raids were harder than other game.. that just tells me you probably didn’t play other games.
---
Later expansions? Sure. I’m with you there.
---
Why does this make me think of Vindicators from Rick and Morty?
---
... you do realize there are a tone of European streamers who act the same way right?
---
&gt; There's been very few examples of what that actually is however.
---
Guild Wars is a case study of worthwhile horizontal content. GW unlocks alternative gear or ability options that are the same power-level as core content, but also allow for greater build diversity. Additionally, it offers vast cosmetic options and expansion-specific progression. Eg. in modern GW2, every expansion essentially has its own "Mastery" levels which you level up while in that expansion and they grant benefits specific to that expansion only.
---
In WoW, a very simple form of horizontal progression would be using the already-existing gear system. Raid-level gear with stat allocations and different set bonuses could be added to encourage people to run this content, and in turn this would allow wacky concepts like Prot Paladins being viable in a tank capacity for raids. All without actually touching class balance.
---
rake to 40 then broken tooth to 60. EZ GG
---
That is what I thought, I wanna have all the necessary healing points and then pick up some tanking points to do dungeons and aoe farm. IDK if thats possible, I dont want to be the best tank, just capable enough to do dungeons with friends. Healing is the priority
---
Do guards not get aggro from kited bosses in the beta/stress test still?
---
&gt; If content is added, what's the incentive for doing the content if it doesn't potentially progress your character?
---
There are MMO games that do horizontal progression really well, like EvE Online or GW2, or seasonal content on a rotation like PoE or ESO.
---
Yeah I went there to tame one a week ago in the classic beta, went there as a lvl 13 troll. But, tell me what you think, I died like 10 meters from the Darnassus portal in that small fishing village. I'm pretty damn sure I was supposed to be brought back to the spirit healer close to Auberdine, but I was brought to the spirit healer in Dolanaar. So I just ressed there, and ran to a lvl 9 owl and tamed it.
---
So I never had to take the boat as a ghost...
---
Felt just so wrong! I reported it as a bug, but I'm not 100% sure.
---
Alliance are far better in pve, fear ward , paladin, close to mc/bwl/Ubers ect. Threat is gonna play a huge roll even more so once we hit bwl and onwards the paladin salv will help incredibly with that and the fear ward too. Ony attunement is far easier too.
---
10 meters is 10.94 yards
---
Unless you call DM VC!
---
&gt;miss
---
Did they ever fix the reliability issues with those? I got frustrated after going through 3 of them and got the G600 instead. I think I was the only person that liked the two buttons in the left side of the left click area on the early ones too.
---
I second this.  Female undead and troll are close seconds tho
---
You said it yourself, Vanilla is delicate. Splitting the community is deeper than just numbers. Just for an example, say the crafting guild that everyone goes to on your server, full of people who play to make money and make stuff, disappears when TBC or Wrath comes out. Sure, you've got a server that is still alive and well, but certain people disappear. Now, there's 2 Blacksmith's on the server, one Alliance, one Horde, and both of them are Armorsmiths. What if the last alchemist on your faction quits and goes to TBC, leaving someone else to farm rep and mats until they can transmute arcanite. Player injections from other servers count as well, where PvP gets thrown of kilter because of a server merge or a streamer server gets merged into yours or vice versa.
---
The community is an important part of the game, as we know. You lose certain people, not 200k players.
---
If we could find a middle ground with a Classic+, I'd be mostly satiated. If we get Wrath Classic, I'd be satiated. Both have their downsides, the split servers affecting the prior servers through population changes and who leaves, and Classic+ changing Vanilla. Either works for me, as long as it doesn't stay 1.12 forever. I like 1.12, but it's not what I want.
---
I think OP is asking more the *purpose* than the existance.
---
Yes you are right. A lot of work, but I hope that the product, wow classic, could pull in the revenue needed.
---
How’s the Tauren hitbox now? And especially for hunters? Did they make any changes or is it still crazy like that video we saw of a warrior and hunter melee each other from like 9 yards away?
---
I can’t wait for my friend and I to hit 49 and for me to go “We’re almost halfway!”
---
&gt; How is it at all better to merge realms later rather than sooner? Would you rather cut off the infected foot early and get it done with, or let it fester and get worse ? Easy choice
---
Your mistake here is that you're assuming that there would never be a potential eventuality in which a previously-layered server would need to be merged anyway.
---
&gt; And just to add, having a higher max population is far worse to a classic launch than it is having layering 
---
An MMO is centered around the concept of "one cohesive game world per server".  Sharding tech (including layering) is _directly_ antithetical to that concept, and Ion said as much during Blizzcon.  The only debate here is which is the lesser of two evils.  I didn't think playing on a realm with over _10,000_ concurrent players (happened several times on Nostalrius) was a "drastically different" experience, thanks to the way they did dynamic respawns.
---
So, basically, I disagree.  We're getting layering.  I've accepted it.  That doesn't mean I don't think it wasn't the worst possible choice that Blizzard could've made.  And let's be clear, they've made a lot of bad choices over the years.
---
And by simply playing on the same faction as they did a decade ago, you too can become elite by proxy! That's how it works right? 
---
We had plenty of shitty and average guilds on the Horde side. The world first type guilds are a drop in the bucket compared to all the average Joe guilds taking their time and cruising through content.
---
Emasculated.
---
&gt; Honestly I don't think there is a better system than the current one. In the end WoW was never sandbox anyway.
---
All you know is the current system.
---
WoW isn't a sandbox, I agree, but that's the problem. Everything people hate about retail happened because theme park MMOs will eventually **require** such changes just to be playable.
---
&gt; What does this mean though? Like it would just be 1-60 then BfA?
---
An idea could be that 1-60 is an evergreen experience that is updated to lead into a new endgame experience every few years, instead of having to level through six different, irrelevant expansions that are set in stone.
---
There are other ideas, like forced reboots, etc.
---
Because you listen to idiots?
---
It CAN be done, and I’d be happy if it was done well.  But here’s the thing, I have ZERO faith in WoW’s current dev team to create new content for Vanilla that’s done right.  The only reason Classic will be good is because they’re just following a very specific blue print already laid out with absolutely no need for them to create anything new. 
---
If my choice is a gamble on whether or not Blizzard / Activision is able to make new content for vanilla that is done properly, or a recreation of TBC as it was, I’m taking TBC 10 times out of 10.  Is TBC perfect?  Of course not.  But it was the best version of WoW in my opinion, and I’ll be trilled if I get a chance to play it again.
---
me too :(
---
&gt; That's a WoW 2 level of change, not an expansion's.
---
True.
---
“For the King!”
---
Imp drain soul is mandatory (imo) for leveling. How is yours a meme spec?
---
Tauren Warrior! Only because I genuinely hate the orc and troll model and I don’t like that my plate armor will still show bones through plate armor.
---
Unless they made tanking exponentially harder since mop tanking is much harder on vanilla, especially if you have to tank more than 1 target
---
Even if that were true, are they going to lock out ALL the streamer's names on ALL the servers? No, of course not.  
---
A follower will be sitting on the name on every server, and might end up giving it away for a small modicum of attention if the streamer wants to move.
---
Hit me right into the feels. 😢
---
Ok, thanks bot. It was actually 10.1 meters.
---
killing blows from your pet does trigger the proc on beta.
---
At least it did last week when i was testing it with my WW.
---
Right clicking streamers.... Because pvping against organized groups was so easy.
---
Stay carebear.  I know you can't handle pvp and raiding because you're inept.  Enjoy your nerfed naxx and AQ clears.
---
If people see streamers as a problem and if I was a famous streamer, I would prefer to be part of the solution than be the part of the problem.
---
"Unbalanced servers" creates a new paradigm. People will leave, other will join just for the challenge. At the end, an "unbalanced server" doesn't stand long. It will always find its balance.
---
If so I'll definitely rethink BS as second profession.  Sorta pushes alchemy to forefront for making some side gold and easy consumes.  Just requires a herb/mining alt which shouldn't be hard to have by Phase 2. I'm only raiding 2 nights a week with an optional 3rd one.  Can't imagine being a feral on a 4+ night raid week. Gnomer MCP farming alone is a lot on 2 nights.
---
Awesome, I’ve never looked into addon coding before but want to give it a go so that’s helpful to know, thanks.
---
In raid use max rank Aimed Shot rank 1 multishot.
---
Once you have more Mana, and bosses die faster, use higher ranks.
---
Lol definitely a more blunt way of putting it but yes.
---
I dunno, man.  I played vanilla on Kilrogg at launch and my server called it VC.  Personally though I dont care and was LFGing for DM in beta last week when I was 18-20.  I'll call it Defias Killfest 2019 if that's my server's norm.
---
Superman wears Chuck Norris pajamas.
---
I would use that weapon
---
No u
---
That's why you spend your raid time having fun and spamming gachi songs in vent.
---
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:
---
- [/r/u_theusosaito] [Can we all appreciate that there are literally hundreds of people playing in one area and the servers aren’t crashing and only lagging a little, if at all?](https://www.reddit.com/r/u_TheUsoSaito/comments/bvd5s8/can_we_all_appreciate_that_there_are_literally/)

&amp;nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))*
---
&gt; And because of the seperation between the two, there's no reason to go back to the old game for players effectively killing that version.
---
That's why each new expansion completely replaces the previous game. It's the only way to make it work.
---
This will allow the sequels to follow closer to the pacing and philosophy of the previous game, therefore there'd be less nostalgia for the removed content.
---
Do this but don't expect raid spots if you are doing it "your way".
---
Nah if someone says something like “I want to try a port Paladin to see how it is” and the elitists hop I. Like “well then you can’t play in MY guild” and “no, paladins and only buff and heal and nothing else should even be thought of” 
---
Like damn, I didn’t want to do end game raiding anyways and definitely not with YOUR guild. If someone wants to try some fun, then there is no reason not to and saying “well my guild won’t let you do Anything else” is just toxic for the community. (I’m not saying to let those people in your raid, just that there’s no reason to look down on those players)
---
There's some pride knowing the best of the best for your Faction beats out the best of the best for your Enemy Faction 90+% of the time, yes. That's how professional sports work.
---
Check out cdew! I've been loving his classic streams
---
And remember unlike Vanilla the powershifting macros will work much faster. One plus of using a newer client in Classic.
---
Stormx is a great druid. Super chill stream. Very non-toxic like a lot of the other streamers/chats.
---
"comparing this to retail"... here we go again
---
It's even more important for casual guilds not to play sperg builds. Hardcore guilds have space for them and them to get carried. Casuals dont.

Yep totally,

---
Gives you all the holy talents you need (the 5 points in divine strength can be put elseware but they are good for tanking as str increases block amount), this also gives you blessing of sanctury and consecrate for tanking.  
---
Then more casual guilds will let you get away with

21Holy / 30 Prot -  [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/AzzRxAQ83wHoAA](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/AzzRxAQ83wHoAA)   
---
Something like this lets you healing in pvp but still have reckoning. And it sick for aoe tanking as each crit activates reckoning and redoubt - no holy shield though.  
---
You may even get away with 20holy / 31 prot  [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/AzzRwAQ83wHpAA](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/AzzRwAQ83wHpAA)   
---
You heal just fine but lack the sustain in longer fights - some mana pots can make up for this thought and you become a fully viable aoe tank.  
---
Its worth noticing i didnt pick up the +10 defence and went with reckoning to increase dmg assuming your not planning on tanking raid bosses or getting def capped to avoid crits. More crits = more dmg = more fun aoe tanking - but only viable for dungeons, and trash. Raid bosses will squish you.
---
Sergeant Ninjafoo reporting for duty.
---
The guild should really be helping out with the tanks consumables though.
---
Very autistic.
---
The speedrun was only mentioned because it was a roadblock for guilds that didn’t have the raid on farm. For the very serious guilds, it was a non-issue.
---
But the rest of the chain was long and involved, and took significant effort from the guild for each player that wanted to get that far. Not many guilds were particularly concerned with getting as many people as they could through the chain.
---
Was literally not gonna have this exact comment, take my downvote.
---
You need to be level 35. You could even level an army of hunter twins for more cool downs :)
---
Yeah I should have been more clear. It's the holding threat and AOE tanking that's a lot harder in Classic, though the actual mechanics and mitigation side are easier on the part of the tank.
---
Basically you notice the good warriors more in the simple 5 mans as you level rather than the raids.
---
Did you kill them?
---
I played Vanilla and I would always burn out around level 30. I specifically remember that quest where you had to collect 60 boar tusks or whatever being a breaking point for me.
---
Lol I played so many alts and hardly made it past 20. I'm gonna try to reach 60 on Classic but if I just end up making tons of alts and goofing around the same as when I was 14 that's fine too.
---
it's better in ab and av, the Druid class is bar none the best flag carrier and soda cares too much about optimal play

Nice, I was thinking 31/20 prot might be a thing, I will have to look through your linked builds in detail and figure out what I want to do. I just wanted to make sure it was possible before picking my class for classic :)
---
The axe skill is also a big deal, and shadowmeld is great. Also tauren reach is unique, so if you want that you must be tauren.
---
And then open up Grim Batol and turn it into Blackrock mountain 2.0 containing an absolutely massive non linear dungeon containing 20+ bosses, a raid instance and some gnarly attunement that requires you to navigate and take on every labrynth of the elite filled city.
---
Yup
---
Jagex is the company. Runescape added legacy servers a few years ago and they are currently more popular than the modern servers. After about a year of these legacy servers, Jagex started adding more content with the same graphics and mindset of old school runescape to preserve the feeling of the 2007 version of the game. They've added a number of QoL things that players expect (eg. fullscreen), but content is limited to stuff that would fit perfectly into the game back in the day.
---
To preserve this game philosophy, any major updates need to be polled by the community and are announced well-ahead of actual implementation. The idea is that it keeps the company on track with the playerbase's wishes so that the game doesn't get ruined by a company that believes "*You think you do, but you don't"* is a sustainable business philosophy.
---
Staysafe was in the beta early on and said Imp Drain Soul wasn't working as it does on pservers. It was proccing ONLY off of the Drain Soul ticks and nothing else. So you have to get the killing blow with drain soul to receive the proc.
---
All we can do is imagine what it would have been like if burning Crusade was more like classic. If wrath was more like classic. There is an ideal Sweet Spot somewhere in between keeping everything exactly the same and changing certain things to reward players a little bit more in order to account for the fact that we are wired to need more Rewards the longer we do something as incentive to keep doing it.
---
Sadly we are not doctor strange and we cannot look into the past or look at 14 million and five different futures. We have no idea if the design decisions made in burning Crusade and Wrath actually limited potential player growth and had they done something more true to Classic player growth would have been even greater. We have no idea. All we know is how much the player base increased in burning Crusade, and then increased on top of that in Wrath.
---
Was the time between wrath and cataclysm just coincidentally the arbitrary amount of time many people reached a point of noticeable burnout and so they reacted more harshly when certain things were changed?
---
I didn't get a chance to duel anyone. I spent all my time trying to get this bear. LOL
---
“Wanna kill Hogger?”
---
“I don’t adventure with try paladins”
---
Staysafe is pretty insufferable tbh
---
No, something bad happened to his pants when he saw that.
---
You got me there.
---
There are 6 zones it can spawn in. On Vanilla it could spawn in all of them, just 1 spawn per zone.
---
Is that really in the policy? I remember the Bejeweled addon being pretty heavily obfuscated. Maybe PopCap got special permission for that
---
And you did **absolutely nothing** nothing to help just like 99.99% of the rest of us lol. But sure, you can take their achievements as your own because you happened to pick the same faction if that's how you roll.
---
&gt; you're essentially removing all previous content, thus making sure that new players never get to experience it.
---
Yeah, this is pretty much a necessity. It's not a perfect solution but let me bring this up: I got into WoW because of Hearthstone. I loved the BRM and Naxxramas adventure packs. I wanted to play those storylines in WoW, but I couldn't! 
---
That content isn't really in the game anymore. Not in any meaningful way. The attunement quests, Lady Prestor, original Kel'Thuzad, etc. have all been removed or deprecated.
---
So this already happens. But yeah, more and more content would be inaccessible and that's unfortunate (although some of the previous raid content could be rotated in some seasonal way through Caverns of Time mechanics.)
---
In essence, what this idea tries to fix isn't necessarily that people want to see Vanilla lore, but Vanilla gameplay. Replacing original content would allow the sequels to follow closer to the pacing and philosophy of the previous game, therefore there'd be less nostalgia for the removed content to begin with.
---
No. The vanilla spirit is alt tabbing all the time /s
---
Gtfo
---
This why Tauren warrior = best warrior
---
I feel like they could use some horizontal progression expansions, instead of this constant climb.
---
Interesting how there are no bears quicker than 2.0 attack speed but there are some *slower* than 2.0 attack speed at 2.4 and 2.5.
---
So I’m gonna play warrior since I’ve played warrior as a starting class and I like the idea of fury. But what professsions should I run? I was thinking mining and blacksmithing but I’ve never played vanilla so idk
---
Hi, /u/XxSavagechaosxX
---
Sooo everyone sucks but Asmon?
---
Typically, all holy pala's in a raid go for the 30 in holy, then spread out the rest of their point to get all the improved blessings between them. Holy shock is nice for tanking too so 31/20 can work, some snap agro and can totally work but you miss so many of the good aoe tanking skills i find it makes it less fun
---
Or MCing the opposite faction, healing and buffing them.
---
A++++ comment. Totally agree with your points.
---
When buffs made a difference
---
They can't get their skill to 300 because level cap is 30. Highest they can go is 225.
---
This is a good point!
---
How long did it take to kill?
---
When my team beats your team, I'm not claiming to have been on the field. But that doesn't mean you didn't choose the losing side.
---
Nostalrius had, at several points, hosted over 10,000 concurrent players.  It crashed occasionally, but then again, it was a tiny team doing things mostly out of their own pocket with their own makeshift servers.  Thanks to the way they did dynamic respawns, the experience didn't feel radically different to a server hosting a third of that many players.
---
You're also making the mistake of assuming that a previously-layered server would never need to be merged.  They're more insulated from it, but certainly not immune.
---
&gt; I think blizzard recognizes that long-term server community health is critical.
---
Introducing intra-server decohesion into the realm during its formative months is a great way to harm long-term community health.  
---
&gt; With no cross-server functionality, being on a dead server sucks.
---
Then merge them.  Again, there's no guarantee that a previously-layered server won't become a "dead server" either.  It may become necessary _anyway_.
---
&gt; I don't love layering and it's not perfect, but I don't see how the alternative of just not having it at all is better.
---
MMOs are built around a single defining concept:  One cohesive game world per server.  Sharding tech (including layering) is antithetical to that.  Ion said as much at Blizzcon.  The only debate is which is the lesser of two evils, and personally, I think the choice there is simple.  Layering is the greater evil.  It doesn't guarantee the absence of server merges, does not eliminate queues, and introduces intra-server decohesion during the most important time period of a server's lifetime.
---
The sad part is I upvoted initially until I realized it wasn't sarcasm.

Pretty sure the "It's not" part was misunderstood as "It's not fun" by several people...

I guess double monitord shouldnt be supported either. Cause thats what i would do to quest if those addons werent available
---
I remember very specifically not being able to wait until I was level 12 so I could try to tame a Kodo Patriarch in Mulgore, because you couldn’t tame pets higher level than you. 
---
I was extremely disappointed when I learned the truth about Kodos being untamable.
---
&gt; Then again though, we kinda get that with new expansions anyways.
---
Exactly. A lot of these fears are things that already happen in game, it's just that they're hidden behind band-aids and camouflage.
---
This I concur my friend, amazing content made on Countdown.
---
Didn't mind the dailies in TBC, they weren't relevant, EXCEPT for the Shattered Sun faction when Sunwell came out (Fuck me, doing those dailies was pure cancer).
---
Could do without flying mounts aswell, fuck that shit.
---
TBC still my favorite WoW experience, Vanilla close second.
---
I'd like to think he pulls a bow over it and shoots the bow at mobs while holding the quiver.
---
I am playing on a private server right now. I absolutely think Blacksmithing is a great idea as I seldom see blacksmiths.
---
I have an entire 14-slot bag full of Blacksmithing recipes on my mule. I feel bad vendoring them. I was offering them all for free in Trade chat but no one would take them.
---
So please, roll a blacksmith so players have something to do with all these damn recipes. Otherwise they just end up on the pile.
---
Plus you can craft the Heartseeker Dagger. Wanted that on my rogue but there were like NO players online on that server anymore.
---
Druids are rare as they really only excel at flag running

Hitting 40 on my warrior reignited my motivation, since I was finally able to use Mortal Strike and also equip plate armor. 50-60 felt like a goddamn eternity though.

No in vanilla and TBC (untill 2.3) the stat was called Weaponskill and acted very differently from the expertise stat that replaced it in 2.3.
---
Oh that Asmondgold
---
For you. So dont use them?
---
Why post about it then? You post, you're seeking something from the community. Maybe it's feedback or information. Maybe it's approval. But if you take your choice public you don't then get to be like "Stay out of my business, I do what I want because I'm a free spirit!" If that's your attitude, then don't make it a topic for discussion to begin with. You can post whatever you want, but you're not entitled to support and praise. Just like you can play whatever you want, but your not entitled to down KT with it.
---
love esfand the most.
---
Yes, I was, hence why I mentioned the dragon gate. What were their original plans before the dumb cataclysm stuff? Did that ever leak in an interview or datamine?
---
well id go mage as you can raid and PvP with similar specs
---
Thanks for your insight!
---
Yeah not surprising if your in Elwynn Forest. I stuck in the NE starting zone and moved to Darkshore. There everywhere around those parts.
---
Still the least popular class over all, but its definitely because your in Elwynn Forest.
---
!RemindMe 79 days
---
All you really need to tank dungeons is the Righteous Fury and shield talents, which is like 16 points IIRC. You can go full holy for the rest of it, which is actually ideal for the mana efficiency and extra sources of holy damage to get threat with.
---
I really appreciate the info, thanks!
---
humans didn't even know that tauren existed until wc3 so i have no idea where you got that idea lmao
---
I’ve heard of this being an option.  I’ll probably dabble, thanks!
---
I didn’t say that did I?  Nor have I ever seen a guild kick members out for that. You guys seem like you create these imaginary situations that don’t actually happen.
---
Do you think 12yo would play seriously MMORPG? With mommy's money?
---
Back in the days, if you want to be part of a group or guild, always within the 1st questions is: "How old are you?". Serious MMORPG players do not want to play with kids (16yo or less), they want to play with mature people.
---
"Sorry pals, I have to go to bed. I can't go to the raid. My mom will block me access to the familly computer otherwise. Hope you will understand."
---
Sure, but adding new levels isn't the complete problem. Another problem is diluting the population across separate leveling / endgame areas. The great thing about Vanilla is that it was designed so that endgame exists within leveling content. 
---
Level 60s next to level 10s. TBC messed things up by splitting the realm's population between completely disconnected worlds.
---
lucky you to have your wife joining you

Good to know that a PvE world set is not unheard of.  I’m just used to one-size-fits-most gear.  Thank you!

Esfand also seems to be doing a good job of finding issues

At the end, we can only guess and see, how it will be on classic. If servers will hold the population people expect (7-10k people), there will be multiple runs for each dungeons made basically at any given time. BRD and LBRS are overwhelming at first, however with the right composition, having people, who knows what they are doing and doing actual speed-run instead of quest-run, it will be fast enough. This is because, a big, unnecessary chunks of dungeons can be skipped. People can get to last boss in BRD in 20min I believe, considering its a good group. Its called a lava run, you can look it up on youtube. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiqqskNqyBg). Normal speed-run clearing all the more important bosses takes longer ofc. In LBRS, people sometimes make 2 type of runs. 1, that consist of clearing up first part of dungeon and 2, run that actually skips the first part and jumps right onto second part) However I still believe, they will be rather quick runs, mainly due to elites being weaker and therefore, pulling extra groups might not be  such a problem and aoe tanking 3-5 mobs will actually be a thing. But this is something I can only guess and we will have to see. About your UBRS key, I wish you good fortune, its a very grindy quest to do. About your tight knit mobs that are easily pulled - I never found this as a problem so I cannot relate.
---
I'm conflicted I wanted to play horde but have one of every race class combo but I don't think it let's me make an alliance toon on a server I have horde on :/ kind of bums me out but I guess it's not that big of a deal
---
Cool this post again. We've come a long way. Let people play however they want and dont assume they arent having fun. Thanks
---
I can't imagine what you are going trough IRL at the moment but I wish you luck dealing with it.
---
I'm really glad the woodcutting grind is over half-way over, I just hit 50!
---
I go Alchemy on every character. Its so good.
---
Streamers will be the death of this game
---
&gt; Even if that were true, are they going to lock out ALL the streamer's names on ALL the servers? No, of course not.
---
This response has absolutely no relevance to what I actually said.
---
I said that blizzard is going to let streamers lock in their names first, not that blizzard is going to lock out names of streamers.
---
I don't know That was the first time I had seen it, it was good times though. I was quite entertained.
---
&gt; Is it “meta” right now to be a Warrior? 
---
As I understand it, warriors are the only optimal raid tanks. And, when geared, fury warriors are amongst the strongest DPS. So if a player wants to pick a class to ensure that no matter what they'll be able to excel, warrior is the pick.
---
I've always played Horde but I never felt proud because 40-60 random dudes in Europe cleared AQ40 before some other 40-60 random dudes somewhere else. I was still in a super chill, casual (Horde) guild that couldn't figure out how to beat C'thun even though we were on the "better faction". And I'm ok with that. I had a ton of fun.
---
But hey man, if Kungen's achievements make you proud of yourself, rock on brother.
---
None of my friends wants to play this with me :/ it sucks but it looks like I'm going in alone for classic. I really hope some people add me and I can make friends here but I have my doubts
---
Interesting story. Thinks. Maybe they format the name string before pushing it into the DB and the GM who changed your name put it in all caps. I did find your char from your original post btw and yes it displays in the armory as all caps. It shows that way in game?
---
Did the same with my Tauren.
---
Hunter, Warlock, maybe Rogue.
---
&gt; As feral you are a decent tank in 5 mans 
---
I don't know if my server was different, but literally every 5 man group in vanilla had a warrior tank. If a paladin or druid asked to tank they would have been laughed at.
---
Our offtanks in raids were also exclusively warriors. The only time from 2004-2007 that I ever saw a non-warrior tank was when my guild let our druid tank Magmadar as a joke when we were all AQ40 geared.
---
They haven't announced anything, though I doubt they will want to deal with the backlash anytime soon so I don't think there will be paid transfers for a long time, but there were paid transfers in vanilla. They started in 2006.
---
I ran over to the Barrens yesterday on my hunter and waited for a horde player to summon Echeyakee for me, took about an hour until I was able to communicate well enough( taming rando lions and naming them "Echeyakeepls" and emotes) and someone finally took pity on me. Lotta nostalgia just waiting around there for that.  (this is the pve server)
---
Join me and together we can save the world 
---
Of Warcraft.
---
From what i could tell, the threat goes to the recipient, not the caster.
---
With the release phases, I don't believe there is a single mail related upgrade in MC, BWL, AQ40, or Naxx. Outside of 5 mans and UBRS, should be uncontested from that front.
---
Sick dude. It's little things like that, that make vanilla so good
---
But even if they can't gather it they can still see it right?
---
Whoever has thorns on them (the buff) generates aggro from it's damage. Hope that answers your question.
---
Naw
---
Gonna was exact leave comment this literally exact, upvote my have.
---
They can scout for them the same way they scout for mithril in higher zones, it'd be a huge pain in the ass, but wondering if someone has tested
---
Shaman, 100%. You will love it.
---
I just really enjoy melee classes and I had a Paladin for AoE grinding at the end of Vanilla that I enjoyed farming on. 
---
The "free" mounts was just a bonus while leveling, and as I mentioned above I leveled my Paladin pretty quickly contrary to people saying they are slow.
---
But since I love PvP maybe I will consider making a Mage instead.
---
There just seemed to be a LOT of warriors. I remember back in vanilla seeing Warriors but not to the degree percentage wise I saw them on the test server.
---
6? EPL, Silithus, Burning Steppes, Winterspring.
---
That's it in vanilla
---
I love the graphics. And to think some people wanted to play Classic using the 1.12 client lmao.
---
How do Tauren have best stats for enhancement ? If your going for best tests for enhancement that would go to trolls for the haste. Orcs win best for pvp. Tauren shamans don’t really shine in either pve or pvp if your min maxing. If your not min maxing you can argue Tauren for pvp against orcs.
---
More like good riddance
---
Lean up in his bladder
---
All caps in game. As of a recent patch it doesn’t show in all caps on the character screen but once logged in it does in the character frame and game chat.
---
Skinning is recommended for when you are leveling. Skin and sell it to vendors, then change it for some other profession at 60.
---
This \^
---
I thought 5 head meant someone with a huge forehead. Because you typically can only fit four fingers on a forehead assuming no receded hairline. 😁
---
I don't think or at least I haven't seen anyone go out that far into the 55+ zones just because of how far the aggro radius is for a lvl 30, I'm sure they will raise the level cap which in turn will increase the testing range as well.
---
That would require me looking through weeks of my YouTube history and finding the one that said that.
---
I'd rather just assume I'm wrong and be pleasantly surprised if I'm right.
---
So are you going to turn down a feral tank on a dungeon run?
---
Honestly I feel the opposite. Most of the toxic people seem to coming from the casuals shitting on min maxers.
---
Have you considered that some people have fun by being as optimal as they can be?
---
Absolutely you'd be unlikely to see a Druid in Elwynn. There were plenty in Teldrassil.
---
Soul link warlock. Or shadow priest, but it's a bit harder to gear. Either one will make people despise you and rogues avoid like fire out in the open world.
---
Was litterally gonna leave this exact comment, have my upvote.
---
My stupid friend went right for the pink hawkstrider in Darkshore.
---
Because some people find him funny?
---
What are you, 60 years old and yelling kids to get off your lawn?  
---
This sub's obsession to personally hate every single big streamer is kind of bizarre, just because they're not your most favorite person in the world doesn't mean them and their fans are troglodytes, as some people like to point out at any possible chance that they have
---
Functionally I think it is helpful, but it discourages exploration, lore reading and NPC intimacy. This kind of stuff little by little diminishes immersion.
---
And Blasted Lands. And outside Dire Maul.
---
You should try raiding paladin.
---
So it's not fun for you then. Stop telling other people what they think is fun c:
---
I will always play horde because it's what I prefer and what the people I know play so there is really no alternative for me. I only bothered with alliance when I wanted to experience their starting/intermediate areas, which were cool but I have never looked back since.
---
Yep I agree with you 100%. I was trying to be funny and reflect the opinion of many people in this sub in a sarcastic way. :b
---
All I can tell you is you don't need to put a single point into prot while levelling. You really don't even need to be deep prot at level 60 to tank unless you're raid tanking. I tanked every level 60 5 man (and UBRS) as arms/fury and did just fine.
---
Ngl, I tripped balls on acid one time and just stared at undercity. Blew my mind.
---
and that's after you did the swoop tame the same way :P or hopefully you invited someone to help
---
Transmog is for communists and baby killers
---
I look forward to people seeing my hunter in full scarlet gear and thinking "what a beast, he cleared SM and yoinked a tank set"
---
Have an upvote for the balls it took to post an opinion and be ripped to shreds for having it.
---
Yeah frost shock helps but most classes have an effective counter to it that leaves you troubled.  When I pvp'd I depended on being on my mount and jumping + casting frost shock as I flew in as my best gap closer.  Instant ghost wolf helped a lot but that didn't come til TBC. 
---
CC is a huge vulnerability as well.  Tremor is pretty great, and poison cleanse is great if you have time to get it out, and grounding is of course awesome as well but they all require you to be reactive and get them out before the CC lands.  Stuns are a big problem, hamstring or other slows are a big problem, seduce is a big problem, and given the mobility of most PVP fights you're often out of range of your totems anyways.  
---
You're frequently the target as a melee class as well, because you have to get into the fight to do damage but everyone knows that the best way to deal with a shaman is to focus your attacks and CC on them.  If you leave the 2h WF shaman alone they will just wreck everyone.
---
Dude this is tits!!
---
Leveled a Troll Prot Warrior in TBC and loved every moment of it. Tanked everything and always got into groups. You level fast when you're among friends. (And it was TBC not Vanilla)
---
Definitely a warlock, you can use daggers as a warlock, invisibility potion for stealth and the succubus has invisibility too.
---
Can you do me a favor and remind me when you are reminded by the RemindMe bot? Thanks. ps pls duel me in MTG Arena if your name is about Magic the Gathering
---
He prob does have better things to do but he might think its fun.
---
As long as you keep your 1h and Shield up to date and pick up the odd piece of gear with +Defense / Avoidance stats on it then you can tank any dungeon while leveling in a full DPS spec. (I'd recommend Arms for leveling)
---
When you hit the mid 50's and start doing the late leveling dungeons then you could probably respect for some Prot talents if you and your group are going to spend the last few levels pounding out group quests/5 man's.
---
You're better off not going prot until mid/late 50s. The reason is that whether you're in dungeons or in the landscape, the ability to kill things more quickly will outweigh the extra survivability you get from prot talents. Also the lower-down talents in prot just are not very good in the context of 5mans.
---
My advice is to go fury until you successfully get berserker stance, and then switch to arms. 53 is the earliest you might consider prot, and only if you're going to try and tank BRD and DM:E at that time. Prot can help with levelcap 5mans.
---
I'm certainly going to miss them blocking the mailbox ... wait, no I won't. ;)
---
So if I post about enhancement shaman dps the replies should be “well you cant endgame raid with the top guile’s” and “just heal lulz!” 
---
That attitude is dumb.
---
Hahaha when I was raiding on my druid there was always one guy who complained he didn't have Mark. I started down ranking it on him so he would see the icon. 
---
A few nights later somebody else was complaining that the other druid and I weren't keeping mark up.  I replaced the other druids gift of the wild with my own down ranked version, then replaced everyone's gift with a rank 1 mark. 
---
Finally hallways through MC somebody notices and asked "wtf is this mark it only gives armour" then everybody started checking and the gig was up hahahaha.
---
My fastest time was 8 days 7 hours (ingame time), that was with help from my main level 60 mage. Probably took 3 weeks real time.
---
You misunderstand what were the requirements then.
---
!RemindMe 73 days
---
When anything happens related to anything pvp? Lol what?
---
Rogue will be fun raiding and pvp will be fun
---
As someone who basically doesn't watch streams, I have to recommend Wowhobbs. Yes, the Wowhobbs from back in the day. 
---
Dude just does his thing. No yelling or fake over enthusiasm.
---
It was going to be an outdoor raid.
---
I think in the vanilla dev AMA they mentioned the Caverns of Time - Battle for Mount Hyjal was originally planned for vanilla (but pushed to BC).
---
I think I’ve minced my words and people clearly decided I’m telling everyone how to play. I’m just fed up with seeing everyone asking which race or class they should pick. Decide for yourself. Or don’t. Fuck it. I min/max I just use google instead of reddit. Or not, clearly everyone would rather see mountains of posts asking how to play the game. I don’t know what I expected from a sub dedicated to a game not even out yet. I’ll unfollow and just get my fix from twitch streams instead! Everyone wins.
---
Man, that set is like the only reason I'm thinking about creating a pally twink.
---
Same. I love what TBC did to the Vanilla world. I loved jewelcrafting and a lot of the little fixes/adjustments.
---
Perhaps, in enough time, we will see multiple versions of WoW running hosting only the good expansions (And vanilla)
---
Wowhobbs doesn't even allow cursing in the chat, I think. Cool dude.
---
Towelliee
---
&gt;  hes a disgusting selfish cretin 
---
on god I laughed out loud
---
Americans work such long hours with basically no vacation time legally guaranteed vs Europe so people who play time consuming games here have to find a way to make money off hustles and hobbies ie; streaming their favorite games. Hence more streamers and a culture of people with no time to game but plenty to watch people game hehehe. You can wither into poverty working part time in America. In Europe a lot of social safety nets and labor laws for the individual
---
This is exactly right. Everyone has their own wants but not every single one can happen. You have to make decisions that make the most people happy and this is it.
---
Haha thanks. As I mentioned in my comment to my post I wasn’t even making a point against minmaxing I am sick of seeing multiple posts asking what to play. Decide for yourselves you big babies.
---
Yea the size wasn't preferable.
---
i can agree, this is true
---
Alliance, unless you like being a peasant and not being able to see your shoes. Then go horde.
---
Because unlike back then, we know in advance how all the stats are going to shake.
---
Wow classic is a "solved problem". We can theorycraft every raid in advance based on known talent values and item tables. Warrior is the best tank. Priest and paladin are the best healers. Warrior and rogue are the best DPS. So expect to see warriors and rogues eeeeeeeeeeeeeverywhere.
---
This ^
---
Curious to know myself, I'm confident even if its broke or perma camped when it goes live, it will be modified. Will be a huge cause of burnout for many.
---
standard arms.
---
50-60 feels bad simply because around 54-55 your options become very limited on where you could go to get any meaningful experience or questing, even then when you get to Winterspring, Eastern Plaguelands, or Burning Steppes with the exception of the plaguelands neither of the other zones really offer all that much.
---
And if you were the lunatic that thought there was something in Silithus (Pre AQ Patch anyways) then you have also wasted a huge amount of time simply going there.
---
I disagree, if only because the one thing I still like in retail is transmogging. Designing a set and going after very specific pieces to complete your transmog design is the closest you get anymore to targeting a piece of equipment.
---
Popcap got a special exception.
---
Oh nice. There was a point I had ctrl and alt bound on them for easier modifiers on my kb binds.
---
Stop posting this guy. Hes a fucking weirdo who destroys games and has gone out of his way to pretend he invented WoW (literally titling his stream "team lead"). Hes very likely making some of this shit up
---
Have another one for getting ripped to shreds then calling them all big babies, Jesus the balls on this one!
---
It’s a lie btw. This dude is a massive exaggerator.
---
How much of a dps loss is it really if I play night elf warrior instead of human?
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LZVVzuxxoVo
---
Hell yea. I twinkled a pally at 19 and 49. My 49 was beast and had a Taran Icebreaker with crusader enchant. Loved that guy
---
I could have sworn the damage was done by the person who had it but the aggro went to the druid. At least in bc that's how I remember it being. I cant remember that far back.
---
I only care about pvp, are warriors the strongest mele and hardest to kill?
---
Lmao your vision is straight out of television. All of my friends and myself grew up playing games. Been on WoW since I was 12, CS1.6 at the same time, played those for years. Yeah guilds ask for age but if you got some brain and education you make it through and you show them age doesn't mean much. Instead the worst players I met were older adults, know why? cause your "sorry have to go to bed" applies MORE to them. "Sorry, work tomorrow, gonna sleep" while we were gaming late. So yeah, pretty much 100% bullshit
---
Nice picture! Are you Omar?
---
You literally cant criticize the design of classic. It's made to be retro.
---
Unless you are a pve ret paladin.
---
Yeah, druids are and will be rare for a variety of reasons, most of which relate to raiding but also most people like to be able to see their actual character during gameplay and not a generic cat or bear model.
---
I plan on summoning doom guards in towns.
---
Also, when tanking while leveling get into the habit of switching between your 2H weapon and your 1H+Shield.
---
You don't need to keep your sword and board on 100% of the time in the leveling dungeons. 
---
If you're taking a lot of damage or low on health put on your shield, if you're topped up and clearing easy trash then switch to your 2h.
---
Even at max levels you will learn when to swap between them while tanking. I suggest getting a macro set up.
---
Soda to me is the most punchable. What a douche.
---
u have small pp
---
Optimally for PvE? No not really... Honestly hunters got the most mileage out of some of the big 2 handers just as stat sticks. I mean, you can raid as 2h fury, ret, or enhance It's just not going to top any charts.
---
Omg that was me back in 2006. I had the full damn set on my hunter including the head and shoulders AND Axe. I thought strength was good for hunters. Looking back I feel so stupid lmao.
---
I think people have every right to be mad when idiot pugs blindly follow the "elite guild optimal comp" guides and exclude classes/specs/races that are unviable for speed clears, but maybe add 2 minutes to a pug raid clear.
---
Even worse, when unoptimal builds get excluded when they actually increase pug raid success by covering fuck ups and preventing wipes/runbacks.
---
Druids are the best 5man tank because of their TPS on multiple mobs. Well, best from the perspective of a mage who wants to CoC shatter and then AE all the trash the druid rounds up.
---
that's my favorite part! you get to experience the whole world. The little amount of quests force you to seek out every corner of the game
---
Go full DPS. You just need a 1hander/shield and mail/plate armor to tank a dungeon.
---
My first character was a nelf hunter and my other half was a druid. Seeing any horde around the starting area was awesome, because we knew why they were there. I remember a time or two while we sat around while visiting hunters were taming and told everyone to leave them be :)  /cheer
---
that's why you right click report and have them muted instantly.

They always shrink when you tame them.

Sodapoppin randomly banned me from his yt channel back in like 2012 so I’ve had a grudge ever since
---
Chuck Norris can kill 2 stones with 1 bird.

That’s literally what my post was about, I didn’t mention new levels.

Wait, you don’t have to run 3 clockwise circles and 1 counterclockwise circle to summon it?

How's your Swedish?

---
Just to mention one quick off the top of my head:
---
"Parry rate is not as certain. The current estimate for boss parry rate is: higher than 15%, but no greater than 16.25%."
---
What about busses?
---
I second this. Skinning is just there to earn extra silvers for skills and buying your mount then it's dumped once you achieve those goals. You can skin until 40, for example, and then drop it for mining once you have your 60% mount.
---
Most people will agree with Mike Kern that pursuing the path laid out by TBC and Wrath will lead to the same decline. I think if it was just a matter of burnout, the game would have recovered. But it absolutely hasn't, and blame has to be at the feet of the design.
---
I think it's useful to have an earnest discussion about game design because it's fairly likely classic will have some kind of life after this two year cycle. We don't \*know\* if the design decisions limited growth, but we have a lot more data and the designers a lot more experience now than back then. It's worth trying to apply that.
---
Imagine not having a flaming demon horse
---
For leveling I would do Herb/Skinning (Send herbs to bank alt and vendor skins)
---
Or Skinning/Enchanting
---
Vendor Herbs and Disenchant every Green/Blue you get while questing and send them to your bank alt for the AH.
---
I will be Mining/Engineering on my Main Warrior but I won't actually level those proffesions until I'm max level with my epic mount.
---
What's an outdoor raid? Are there any other "outdoor raids" in game?
---
I am the lunatic that dinged 60 in Silithus. :D
---
He’s got only a small following but I like Shine. He plays UD rogue, super logical and pretty chill.
---
Yeah, it's never just one thing.
---
Orc zone
---
So I guess the privat Server Had it wrong
---
Yeah by the time the Naxx patch is in people will have their enchants and several extras for eventual Naxx upgrades. Then new players can get the idol enchants because they are way cheaper. The arcanums needed for the early enchants are almost 100g each and you still need the drop and doll.
---
Just the typical pserver vanilla player circlejerk from people who never played vanilla. Anyone who actually tanked in vanilla knows it was way more than 5.6%.
---
Attack table was barely changed at all except for expertise/weaponskill overhaul in 2.3 untill cata. 
---
Here's one source from TBC:
---
I find minmaxing fun.
---
You can also argue that only a fury warrior tank can provide enough threat to allow fury warrior DPS to do max damage. :))
---
I did the same thing, loved the bat/night elf combo.

Lost on your comment here: I’m just pointing out there were major mmorpgs that didn’t add levels in expansions, I gave 2 examples.

Good for you. Me too. NEXT!

woah who wouldve thought if you control all the numbers in a game that you could be powerful
---
The whole idea of the term “memespec” is the worst part of the Vanilla community.
---
We know we can’t raid Naxx as a Boomkin, doesn’t mean we should flame people who want to try out Boomkin or at least discuss it. Nobody is saying you’re a shitty person if you don’t raid with them, but you’re a shitty person when you look down on someone that doesn’t want to cookie cutter their way through the game.

Flying makes world smaller and prevent all the interactions between players in open world at the first place - one of the core elements of mmorpg. This is not subjective opinion (I love flying around on 280% mounts), but its a fact. Outland is massive and yet it feels shrunken and definitely is missing something. Not to mention it makes Azeroth completely irrelevant. This might be fairly subjective, but I think many people feel this way. I have spent 10 years playing pretty much only vanilla/tbc while successfully avoiding other expansions, so I have had enough time to think about the difference between them
---
But then it's just a hamster wheel of niche items. The game becomes more of a spreadsheet than it is.
---
Oh wow they had to have made him at least... 3 times stronger!!
---
In a team composition with healers keeping them up, yes. On their own? They have the fewest escape tools and are most likely to get kited. It's doable if you're good, but a solo warrior is going to have a rough time.
---
I guess if you assume that is a child. And I think you might be alone in that assumption.
---
I just assumed it was his wife/gf.
---
I spent days hunting Broken Tooth. I was so damn proud of that cat after I tamed him. I’d sacrifice myself to save him when we were out leveling. Vanilla WoW was something special.
---
It was a buffed up Hogger. 
---
Camera is just zoomed out far.
---
Dude, 59-60 does not take as long as 1-30, I think you are definitely exaggerating some of these numbers.  Vanilla was not quite as difficult as you think.  I rolled on Duskwood in Vanilla when they released it, we had MC cleared within 3-4 months from release and were nowhere near hardcore, about as casual as it gets with raiding, one night a week for a few hours.
---
The best would be mining, but mining is not that easy to level on an overcrowded server. A thing to note about engineering is that it's by far the cheapest profession to level. So you could easily go mining/skinning while leveling and then drop skinning for engineering at cap. On the other hand you won't have the nice engineering gadgets while leveling. I will personally go mining/engineering on my warlock and eventually swap mining for alchemy at some point.
---
Trying new specs and builds is fun for people, idk why that’s hard to understand
---
I can criticize it however I please, it was bad then and it's bad still to this day. WoW's default UI being bad has been a constant since it's inception. It being Classic has nothing to do with that.
---
&gt; Theres no "supposedly". He 100 percent ruined it. And no, he didnt make the game lol.
---
How? You realise Mark Kern quit the WoW team a few months after vanilla launched, before TBC ever released. Was WoW already ruined in vanilla? Shit, why are we waiting for Classic again?
---
Haha well thank you! We are totally excited and I’m excited for the journey of raising a lil man.
---
Even if all I do is level to 60 and cap my 60 activities to professions or 5 man dungeons for wach class, I’ll enjoy that more than playing any other game. Seriously, never was invested into any game other than early wow.
---
Fuck u
---
But this isnt a vanilla reference.  It is a TBC guide.
---
Also it's not 14%.
---
Thanks! I’ve heard that may be an issue, so I’m hoping to find a strong raiding guild on a PvP server that has limited streamer presence. Do we know when they will be releasing the server list?
---
I know gathering+gathering/enchanting is ideal for money, but I want to play around with engineering while I level, and I don't have it in me to level a profession from 0 to max after I hit 60. I'd rather spend that time getting an alt up.
---
Effective health is important in vanilla.  You don’t have all the external cooldowns or active mitigation.   Tanks would straight up get owned if they couldn’t reach certain health thresholds.  And threat is a minor concern outside of Vael.  Wait for a couple sunders and you are good.  Any tank who knows what they are doing has no problems holding aggro.
---
The one being hit gets the aggro. Same goes for the Imp's Fire Shield if you have a Warlock around.
---
Having a Druid/Warlock/Paladin will probably give your tank so much thorns that he'll hold aggro like a champ the first time an enemy hits him.
---
you do MORE damage the MORE mobs that are on you!
---
I wouldn't worry, I expect a ton of lists &amp; planning when realms get released. Here's the tough part though. Some streamers will likely hide/fake out which server they will play on for as long as they can, to try to retain as much normalcy while leveling as possible. On top of that, a streamer might reroll servers while leveling for a number of reasons (switching from pvp to pve, play with friends on another server, etc.)
---
So, I imagine a master list of streamer servers will be posted, however we may not know where they will be/stay until after release. This list would have to be actively updated before, on, and slightly after release. Bottom line, you could get fucked and have to reroll no matter what (if you care enough about that), although it's fairly unlikely, as it looks like there would only be 1-2 servers that would actually be affected so heavily enough to warrant leaving, in my opinion.
---
I mean it would seem that way but where does it come from. Some speculation puts it on bosses gaining 8 resist per level above the player that you cannot remove with CoE/Spell penetration etc.
---
This would put their resist vs a player at 24 3 levels above which would explain some resist not being removeable (partial resists and full resists on binary spells).
---
However what we do not have is a blue source for this so it is purely speculation and guesswork.
---
Nightfall doesn’t increase the damage of the shadow bolt it just makes it instant. Soul fire should do more damage though anyway though.
---
Many things the devs didn't intend, doesn't mean they should fix it whether intentional or non-intentional.
---
You shouldn't be-able to draw the line at Rare spawn bat probably no one will know about, and stop casting macro's etc
---
Inb4 they are out of content comments
---
Mulgore looks great, has low pop, and is decent speed wise if you know your route.
---
Probably because wow is literally one of the most boring games to watch someone else play. People all just want to actually play not watch someone.
---
Ain't the first time I've been wrong, and it won't be the last. Meh!
---
Yeah, no fucking dungeon finder ever.  That thing is cancerous.
---
I feel like you are not the target market for classic.
---
Just started leveling a priest after my rogue in beta. I can definitely say one of my favorite things is just running around buffing people with fort.
---
Those all need to not happen.
---
News flash: people get bored of watching streams of the same level-capped mid-game content every day for a game they can’t even play themselves.
---
Well that's not what this addon or my criticism was targeting. It was the ability to simply click the quest in the quest tracker and have it open that quest text in quest log. Which if you still think is a "discouragement" of exploration/lore reading/NPC intimacy then I really don't know what else to tell you other than I think you're wrong.
---
I typed up a legit response but realized halfway through this is some weak ass troll shit.
---
Hang on a second. I thought we were all about no changes.
---
Hi, /u/Qwertykeybaord
---
To my point, I think it was three things. I think many of modern WoW's game systems are designed in opposition to the principles in the OP. I don't think Blizzard meant to do that, but that those ideas were lost in the shuffle as the development evolved. I mean, try it for yourself: take a feature you dislike (from retail or otherwise) and compare it to those principles.
---
I actually quite enjoy Soda. He's incredibly popular but he still just feels pretty natural.
---
Anyway,
---
Second madseason, he's awesome. OG Jeffrey is chill as, I like Kargoz, I like Snutz but I'm not sure if you'd like him ha.
---
Venruki is a goddam legend and the more I watch him the more I like him.
---
Don't tell him not to tell people what to do bro!
---
Whenever somebody makes a post like this I can't help but feel it is entirely for selfish reasons. They want to have as little competition as possible, so the are purposely feeding people misinformation. Especially when the "it doesn't matter at all, play whatever you want" is in response to a post asking which is the best because they don't really care about race.
---
Really like Night Elf Priest? Fine go for it, but there absolutely is going to be times that people are going to passover you to get a Dwarf Priest so just make sure if you are making that choice that your race preference is worth it.
---
Mom!!!! BATHROOM!
---
\#NoChanges, let Beast Mastery reign!
---
&gt; Why not experiment with classic and add content which is in spirit with classic.
---
This is where the community is going to lose. 
---
The community simultaneously screams for no changes, and in the same breath asks for changes to the game. 
---
It is going to be ***impossible*** for developers to figure out what people want.
---
Still pretty impressive numbers honestly for lvl 30. If lvl 30 can last people 2 weeks of content, lvl 40 would be good for a month for sure.

I'll still stand by the opinion that they can make TBC/Wrath servers or 'new' Classic content as long as it is done on separate servers from the original Classic ones.
---
Yup cancel Classic this proves nobody wants Vanilla.
---
It takes all types.
---
Most people on east coast US are probably just getting home from work. People on in central and western US are still working.  Europeans are going to bed. Oceanic people are just waking up. 
---
Plus it’s also the same content. Watch when new content comes out and viewer number will sky rocket back up.
---
I could've sworn that mechanics like Retribution Aura and Thorns were threat-neutral, but fuck knows.
---
I can't remember noticing it though, the only behavior of this kind I remember being annoyed by is Power Word: Shield stopping rage from damage taken.
---
If I remember correctly, and it may have changed at some point in Vanilla, you couldn't replace a higher ranked buff... "There is already a more powerful spell in place" or something would pop up.
---
It took me a couple hours but I was able to find my friends old level 19 twink hunter video.
---
ya those shields..lol
---
I mean that's what I'm saying that is revealed in the 2.3 bestiary. Granted some might have been changed before this patch - but most probably weren't. Example below is from said Bestiary of mobs with specific resists (some even negative resist to take increased damage from certain type spells.

---
What weapons would agnome use in Classic? Staff? Dagger? Wand?
---
Tanking in retail just focuses on certain things... most tanks on retail have a bunch more utility that they need to use on top of dosing/surviving and the mobs have way more abilities so tanking isn’t about aggro it’s about controlling the situation with way more variables involved.
---
Yes and please tell me when they changed attack table in wow? They didn't.
---
Why do People have do be reasonable in here i wanted some entertainment
---
&gt; We're not all speedrunners
---
And isn't the speedrun *world record* like 4 days 20hrs played? By Joana?
---
That's 116 hours. If you're an adult with a job and other obligations and you play 2hrs per day, *every day*, or at least average that much, it would take you 58 days, or just under 2 months, from release before you maxed out.
---
More realistically, people seem to agree on anywhere from 9 to 12 days /played for an average player. If we go with 10 days for simplicity, 240 hours, that's 120 days or 4 entire months before you hit 60. That means you'll be dinging 60 right between Christmas and New Years basically. 
---
It's important to keep that in perspective, especially for people who are thinking they'll bang out lvl 60 in the first 2-3 weeks and be ready to start grinding for raids. *Some* people will, but most of us should strap in for a much longer ride.
---
Just fuck off with this shit. It’s against the rules of this subreddit.
---
Just as I said - you are REAAAALY stretching the definition of what viable is. 
---
If you do 300 DPS while other people do 1200 then you are just getting carried. You are not viable, you are a parasite feasting on other people performance. But the boss is dead and it's all what matters in 15 year old content, right?
---
I can't remember how I did it exactly. I do remember I had to replace the gift with the lower rank and then use mark.
---
Game breaking bug that existed in 1.12 -&gt; Fixing it invalidates the game's integrity.
---
Well no one knows the figures for sure, but it's essentially 5 extra weapon skill, so it definitely will help because you won't miss your attack quite as often, but as for a specific number or even % I don't think anyone has the ability to give you an accurate answer at this point in time
---
No. The beta isn't JUST for hype and advertising. there have already been several bugs discovered through testing. Once they raise the level cap (assuming they will eventually) I bet more critical bugs will surface.
---
They didn't really provide details. I assume they meant that all the other raids take place in a dungeon, this would be more open. The Mount Hyjal raid in BC is probably close to what they planned.
---
Tauren hp racial doesn’t scale at all, it just uses your base stamina. Unlike human and gnome that have their racials scale off your total spirit/int.
---
Take what I say with a grain of salt I didn't play a Warrior past level 20 till Legion. There might be better ways this is just my outsider information
---
Answered what? the fact that you can't read?
---
They are talking about the proc from this axe: https://classicdb.ch/?item=19169
---
But I can understand the confusion because of the shared name with the warlock talent!
---
Maybe people are realizing you can just play the fucking game yourself rather than watch somebody play...
---
Can’t comment on rogue, but for holy Pally and priest it doesn’t seem like a bad guideline
---
Did you reply to the wrong thread mate? What rules did I violate?
---
&gt; Probably took 3 weeks real time.
---
Do you mean you played 8hrs 7 days in 3 weeks? I don't necessarily *not* believe you, but that's like 9.5 hours per day.
---
Still trying to figure out if I want to level enchanting to get SHotM but not keep enchanting. Really want alch/herb.
---
lol that's a weak excuse, soda pulls 40k whenener he wants
---
It's just the way you think doesn't really make any sense. I chose English servers because I speak English. I did not choose it to "get away" from any group of people. It isn't annoying to run into someone who speaks Spanish on English servers even though I can't speak Spanish. I just move on.
---
For sure - that's what I mean the most surprising revelation from the blue post is the crit suppression being that much higher than what everyone assumed. I'm slightly sceptical about it still but it's a much better source than we have had so far. I mean it wouldn't be the first time a blue post has been false/wrong.
---
Druids are underrated. Mainly due to their limited optimization for raiding, which frankly in a completely solved state is something you'll have to decide for yourself whether you care or not. I personally don't see the point in chasing DPS meters when it's already largely predetermined. 
---
Beyond that, Druids are excellent at WPvP, questing, can do everything in dungeons, have a unique and incredibly important role in premade WSG, still work fine in premade AB and in "regular" BGs (what most people will do) have nothing to complain about. They're the hardest to kill, they have a high skill cap and they don't have incredibly bad matchups (there's some, warlocks for instance, but you could theoretically always escape). 
---
Their lower numbers are also a question of design however. First, the playerbase is split into different factions and then into different races. Their 1-race limitation hurts their numbers a lot. 
---
&gt; Is it “meta” right now to be a Warrior?
---
That's a fair statement. Again, vanilla is a solved meta. 2004 Warriors were massively different from 1.12 warriors. Hell, there was a time everyone used Mortal Strike for every single piece of content in the game. At this stage, they're arguably the best scaling class in the game that will be picked for their top raiding DPS, their unquestionably optimal tanking role and their massively powerful premade PvP impact. 
---
You'll have to deal with their terrible leveling speed and be fine with the fact that you've picked the least effective solo class, but beyond that they're wrecking balls through and through when it comes to endgame and people know this by now.
---
You said there was tons from vanilla.
---
A TBC reference isnt a vanilla reference.
---
So what's up with these hordes of people? Who the fuck is so obsessed with all these streamers to the point where they want to meet up with them and serve them. It has to be kids.
---
It's not a bad ui. It isn't perfect, but you can play the game just fine without any addons. I feel like you are going way overboard with this criticism. It has imperfections, but that doesn't make it bad. Pretty much every mmo I've seen from after wow uses almost the exact same thing. If it's so poorly designed why does everyone use something so clearly based on it?
---
Somehow my data doesn't come up on that site :(
---
wow, this is super cool, thanks for sharing
---
Not all heroes wears a cape
---
Missing procc is 90%, so missing all mobs is 0.9^10, which means getting atleast 1 procc is 1-0.9^10 since those are the only outcomes.
---
I've been curious about this. I have been wondering about future patches to add in stuff that was pushed back? Stuff like Hyjal, Grim Batol, Storming Vault etc that could introduce Horizontal content for folks to do/explore.
---
Obviously it's not no changes but I think it would be cool to see that stuff.
---
Any discussion or speculation of post-Naxx Classic content is temporarily banned until Phase 3.
---
When we know the servers, I hope someone makes a handy list of where every streamer goes so we can avoid them like the plague.
---
I’m going night elf rogue probably. Prefer their animations, mount and starting area. I know I will miss out on sword and mace spec from humans and perception in pvp... and rep grinding made easier. It’s a bit ‘tin foil hat’ to think people (I) would make posts like this genuinely thinking they’re getting ahead.
---
Your computer would drop to 20fps? Ok bill gates. I remember 24 FPS was like the high end target goal FPS (because same as movies) but most people didn't reach it, let alone with fraps runnning. I think most were in the teens, and like single digit for MC and shit.
---

---
My favourite wow streamers ofc
---
You call them idiots but they could say the same about people who choose meme specs. 
---
My point is - they have NO right to be mad. 
---
They can choose a meme spec if they would like. 
---
Just like any raid leader can choose to not take a meme spec. 
---
If someone gets mad about that - they’re the idiot imo.
---
Something to add about stance dancing that I just wanted to point out since a seasoned warr such as yourself no longer has to worry about it but a novice would: you also need to knowledge and quick reactions to know which stance to switch to for that specific ability that will assist you in your situation. 
---
It's not a big factor, and is easy to learn while leveling, but for people who maybe don't have that awareness or don't want to worry about that extra level of intricacy in a fight/rotation, it's something to consider.
---
you have that on a RP server, but actually having a reason to go there would be better of course.
---
They need fishing in order to damage higher level mobs since the game considers your fishing skill the weapon skill for the fishing pole.
---
Esfand showed that his 30 axe did 6 damage to a 38 mob and his fishing pole hit for 80.
---
I'm not sure why people are holding this up as "proof" that classic is "pure" or "a good game".
---
I get that it's just a clip taken from a stream so it is out of context, but he is being very vague with what he wants and what he is asking for.
---
&gt; "WoW needs a set of foundational principles, that you stick to them" 
---
Super vague. Like...what exactly? The developer's goals and design philosophies are not hidden from you. They post about it ***all the time*** and with every expansion. 
---
&gt; "Make fresh content based on the principles that you have to stay true to what makes Classic WoW, Classic WoW"
---
Again, ***SUPER VAGUE*** with no examples. I get it, it's a clip taken from a stream, but it's nonsense. He's not saying anything of substance here. 
---
He's playing a paladin, quite arguably the most boring class in Classic. What he's doing there is pretty much his entire leveling experience - auto attack until the target is dead. Is that a foundational principle?
---
While weaponskill was still in the game you could no longer obtain the stat on gear or through other bonuses and was purely level based post 2.3.   
---
Additionally glancing blows chance was lowered to 25% from 40% and the damage reduction element (35% reduction) could no longer be modified and would always be 35% Unlike in vanilla where you could reduce it down to 5% or 0% (uncertain as of yet if you could push it below 5%).
---
I would rate it as: efficient.
---
Only 2 WoW streamers I can watch without cringing hard:
---
Preach  -   is easily my favourite streamer. He is incredibly knowledgable about the game and is a very level headed player. No tantrums, no whining, funny anecdotes and banter with chat. He is an extremely experienced player in one of the best guilds in the world on retail.
---
Quinn69  -   is kind of whiney but is also hilarious while doing so? He is a really funny guy and very knowledgable about the game, however he usually fights metas and likes to do his own thing. He was the same on D3, top of the game but did his own thing but was very good at explanation towards his actions. Calls people out for who they really are as well.
---
Why does it bother you though that people are asking valid questions about racials on reddit? Yeah they could Google it but why scroll through 100 pages of some random forum when people can just respond immediately here? This is a forum too you know. Just scroll past the posts.
---
I think asking about what race is a very important question for a lot of people, since everyone has their own opinion on when xyz racial is useful, reading a lot of threads makes it easier to decide. A lot of people don't care about looks, but rather what does the best in PvP/PvE and is 'the best' for their intended way of playing the game.
---
I don’t play online but I’ll totally remind you
---
How is it the streamer's fault that a bunch of morons desperate for attention follow them around?
---
O think he was spawned , not kited . And with not evidence I'm gonna say the gaurds don't agro to spawned NPC enemies
---
Ideally, Azeroth will be big enough for both groups of people, we’ll have hardcore progression guilds, and more casual raiding guilds.
---
Reminds me of my Level 10 Tauren hunter experience in vanilla. I didn't go that far, but I walked through Ashenvale and Darkshore on a pvp server to find a level 10 Nightsaber. I learned when I got there that I would have trouble finding a Moonstalker Runt that wasn't level 11+
---
I still have my [Nyte](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/character/us/stormrage/%C3%A5rke/collections/stable) that I tamed there. Though I've since transferred it to alliance to be my main hunter.
---
Totem twisting would have never been invented if it wasnt for that stubborn Enh shaman who had the dream of getting a hand of rag.
---
We know what faction you play...
---
Bless up
---
At the moment. He will race at release. Or do test runs before. Atm ofcourse he first needs to test lots of stuff for his guide and his run.

oh come on, blizzard is one of the biggest game companies in the world. they don't need a bunch of randoms testing their games for them.
---
this beta was 100% hype and they fucked it up by dropping it way too early.
---
I saw pretty massive lag when watching the first stress test. People's screens were practically frozen, but the client still displayed players running in a loop. This was only during max stress obviously.
---
Was the second stress test any better at handling these max stress situations? I didn't watch any of it.
---
The flight from Moonglade to Felwood (alliance) is wrong - it's about 58s to fly there. Your chart has it going to Rut'heran and Auberdine.
---
Normally your point would be valid. However this isn’t a new or changing game. Meme specs are meme specs because that’s what they are. Pretending there is a discussion about it at this point is literally a waste of time. 
---
Does that mean no one can play boomkin?  Of course not. 
---
But acting like with enough discussion it can become anything but a “meme spec” is just plain stupid. 
---
I feel like people take things way too personally. It’s a raid leaders right to be as efficient and meta as they want. They can be totally off meta and still down content. 
---
But acting like they are doing anything wrong by wanting to play meta and excluding specs they don’t want is asinine and makes you look like the very asshole you claim to be standing up to.

&gt; addons to the rescue to shore up Blizzards poor UI design. 
---
They could have added it easily. 
---
It was not added for classic because players would absolutely lose their fucking minds if any QoL is ever introduced into Classic that didn't originally exist before. 
---
Which is ironic because addons are going to fix that problem, and the majority of players will download those addons because those features are too nice to skip out on. 
---
In before "...I won't use those addons."
---
1/2 , I'll take it
---
Dude that's also how I learned lmao
---
Thing is it's all subjective. Some people dont get supporting tbc either. In the end the best thing is for classic NOT to be a repeat of what led it to today. It should become it's own thing.

72k viewers on twitch watching WoW at 5pm. For real, dead game...

I did the opposite. I was leveling a tauren hunter on a private server and saw a Dwarf showing up to tame the pink Tallstrider. I was camping it as well, and he started channeling to tame it before me, so I killed it. He made a new character and proceeded to to write in general chat I was botting. The true Vanilla experience. I love it.
---
Yeah, when article 13 hits, you won't have to worry about a single one!
---
PvP or PvE server? If you're PvP I would definitely respec to Mortal Strike at 40 regardless of what you do. In that case, either start as 2handed Arms or 2handed Fury and respec at 40. 
---
Don't touch Prot while leveling. You don't need it, it's not actually much better (main issue is keeping threat and DPS specs do just fine in that department). Just keep your shield and 1-handed weapon up-to-date and you'll do fine while getting far more mileage out of your DPS spec.

Have whatever opinion you want, but it gets tiresome when every discussion on a spec turns into "lol garbage memespec".
---
&gt;Was literally  gonna have this exact comment, but couldn't.
---
While I agree that would be the best way to implement re-releases of the expansions, I also think that's not a good long term strategy. It splits the development team into fragments for each expansion, and it only pushes the problem of the end of content down the line. It also doesn't really solve the content problem for the earlier servers. If people get bored and end their subscriptions, can Blizzard actually afford to keep up those servers just on the off chance they want to return?
---
Blizzard got themselves into their current mess by not thinking ahead. With fair reason, nobody assumes they'll produce a two decade long mega-hit. But they're done it a few times in different genres, so maybe this time it's worth thinking through.
---
I gotta agree with Mike Kern, a straight 1:1 of TBC and Wrath isn't the best move. Use the assets, but its better to develop it again now with the benefit of hindsight. How many studios get that chance?
---
Look, our views cannot be reconciled. I see the forced name changes and the mixing of several different communities as a worse solution to layering, and you don't. I am sympathetic to that view, but if I choose a name, I better keep it.
---
This post caused hundreds of people to google what nadir meant.
---
I think I managed one level in Silithus, with my terrible idea being that I was clearly one level too low for the quests to appear to me so I grinded out a level fighting the elementals where you would fight thundarian and once I dinged and no quests appeared I said fuck it and left for winterspring to level in that nearly as awful waste of space, its one redeeming quality was Firewater, tonnes and tonnes of Firewater.
---
Preach is also leaning towards pve.
---
Ok but can you wear shoes? Checkmate.
---
Let it all out bud
---
Everybody play Boomkin!
---
Did you try other pets to see if they all just turn into female undead?
---
Lok'tar Omar
---
Honestly don't even downvote. It's also attention.
---
They beta test every game they put out...
---
This is /r/classicwow - buffs make a difference.
---
The term you're describing is called a parasocial relationship.
---
Why wouldn’t they be? Would you want blizzard to only give access to people who will suck their dick?
---
Don't bother unless you're thinking of tanking raids. Enchanting is such a worthless and expensive profession.
---
Right, but do they shrink to a static size shared by every pet of that family at that level or is there some degree of variation (however minor) due to post-taming growth?
---
I suspect it's a set, standardized size. Given differences in attack rate, special abilities and all the other little details that remained after taming in Vanilla, however, as well as my not having found anything to confirm that yet, I can't be certain. Which is why I'm asking here.
---
That's really weird clearing MC before it even released. Especially when the world first kill took over 4 months from the MC release (which didn't release until after the game was already out). I am not exaggerating my numbers at all you will not see a guild get 40 people geared enough to handle the FR and damage needed to clear Ragnoros for quite some time World first was 6 months in Vanilla I would assume people are a bit more knowledgeable but it would still take 3-4 months. And yes the xp necessary to get from 59-60 is about the same as it is from 1-30 it is a hell of a grind and the world first race to 60 will be a lot longer than most people think it's a marathon I would assume around 4 days we would see the first but to get a 40 players on a server in the same faction would definitely be 2-3 weeks alone.
---
Its actualy a buffed Thrall with a Hogger skin.
---
Bolvar got despawned and "Thrall" 3hitted all the guards
---
The #1 challenge for casual guilds is finding 40 people to show up on time with consumables and proper prep.
---
I'd take a shadow priest who is reliable over a mage who is flakey.
---
Hardcore guilds can afford to be picky.
---
WoW was casual because you aren't punished like MMO's before it. You think Vanilla takes a lot of times? Older games required more dedication because when you died you lost stuff. WoW you pay a repair bill and thats it. You died in other games (i'm too young to have played them, WoW was my first, but I remember stories) you lost experience, gear, etc. At least this is what I'm assuming he means by casual.
---
I remember when I first started playing wow back in 2008, the things I had the most fun with, and still do to this day, was doing things like this and exploring just because I could and I'm so very excited to do it again
---
Its a different time
---
UBRS should be a 10 man raid as that is what it was in 1.12. Scholo and Strat should be 5 man, they were capped at 5 in 1.10.
---
“They don’t need a bunch of random testing”
---
As the past few retail expansions have been riddled with bugs.
---
What’s a spergbuild? While I’m asking what’s a meme spec?
---
I wasn't saying transmogging is bad. I like transmogging.
---
Perfect! Just like OSRS content for classic only no expansion updates. But new raids and pvp etc with classic core values and where you can re run MC regardless and other old dungeons as that's what classic stayed true to. Sure you could be in naxx but you would always come back to MC too.
---
I remember on my first Hunter (night elf) taking hours to run down to Mulgore to tame The Rake. Despite being on a pve server I used shadowmeld any time I saw a Horde player. I managed to tame it, hearth back to Darnassus, and get it well fed just before a storm made me lose power.
---
[source](https://forum.twinstar.cz/threads/threat-of-sunder-armor-and-heroic-strike.117894/)  here you go captain autismo. SA generates more threat, at minimal equal to HS. HS is only a rage dump as specific rage caps. You’re attackspeed only matters in this rage dump cap. I expect nothing less than you not researching or checking my source. Health is more important than the troll racial in tanking. I’ll drop the mic here casual.
---
Oh man :( you're saying I'm not gonna make 80 silver from my Bear form quest? Makes sense I guess
---
&gt; Functionally I think it is helpful, but it discourages exploration, lore reading and NPC intimacy. This kind of stuff little by little diminishes immersion.
---
And yet, the reason it was added in the first place was because players were downloading these exact addons in droves. 
---
It was such a popular addon that to not have it put you at a disadvantage over players that did have it. It was so much a "part of the game" that Blizzard incorporated it. 
---
What do you do as a developer when you have a majority of your player base using a certain feature of your game? Do you just let them download it? Do you break it? Do you incorporate it to make the game easier to approach for your players, thus making them want to spend more time on it? 
---
It's like owning and operating a burger stand. You notice that a lot of your customers start to bring their own utensils to eat their burgers with. I mean, you don't have to have a fork and knife to eat that burger, but people enjoy it. In fact, the majority of your customers bring it. So you say, what they heck, and start to supply it for them. 
---
It's simple business moves.
---
Where does it say that? It's not stickied and it's not in the subreddit rules.
---
another reason that wasn’t mentioned, repair costs scale based on the type of armor with cloth being the least expensive and plate being the most. this means it’ll cost you like 5x as much gold for a repair than your mage friends
---
The actual Classic team is probably only a dozen people or so.  The hard part about Classic isn't getting it working, it's getting it working and still being a faithful representation of Vanilla.  A faithful representation in ALL REGARDS; In EVERY aspect of the game, all the time.  That takes a ton of work, as they would basically have to comb through every square inch of the game to make sure everything is right.   So you can either have them do all the work themselves, and have Classic a year and a half - two years from now, OR get thousands of people who are innately familiar with they game play it and find bugs for you;  WHILE generating hype.
---
But it's obvious you are a troll so I doubt you'll agree with me anyways.
---
Good day, sir.
---
You just throw the arrows it's no bug
---
Current wow maybe, but they said classic is as it was and killing low levells or tanking alot is not grieving it's part of wpvp. If people are against it go to a PvE server.
---
It’s not 1999 anymore dude, companies realize they can either pay for testers or let 1000 frothing nerds do it.
---
Of you want to go around soloing people, play a rogue. A warrior without a healer to assist him is pretty bad in PvP without a lot of gear
---
Kungen is evidently broke and is shilling BDO and throwing the game he's loved and gave him a life under the bus.
---
It is just as good or better even if the mechanic you are researching was never changed. 
---
If your only argument is that there is no vanilla source for something then you are going to be in trouble because there are no real vanilla sources for almost anything. Simply because real theorycrafting and documentation (videos etc) werent really being done untill late TBC. Even TBC is horribly documented in many areas.
---
Clearly the vanilla "sources" were less accurate than my TBC source above as you can see from the blue post confirming 14% parry.
---
How do you find out which servers are "unofficial" ones?    
---
I live in Asia so I want to be able to play on a server that has other people around my time zone but I don't even know where to look
---
Druids are just really hard to master. They have weird mechanics and require some pretty unique and quirky items to work well. When you see a druid who excels at his role (except oomkins) you just sit there in awe. I've seen good druids outheal priests and paladins, outdps rogues and mages and be better tanks than warriors. 
---
Unlike warlocks which just have a very high skill ceiling, druids have a high skill floor as well. An average resto druid won't be anywhere near the other healers and it's best just to bring him for the innervate and combat ress. Same can be said about feral. I think that's why they are pretty rare.
---
use \\
---
Broken Tooth was my boi. Got soooo lucky. Just happened to be there the first time I ever went to tame him.
---
What is your native language, and where are you from?
---
If you're making your build specifically for PvP, then go Arms. Mortal Strike is insane. No reason to play anything else.
---
Prot works in the sense that you can play it well enough (i.e. you won't be holding your team back) as long as you focus on objectives in battlegrounds, not kills. I just wouldn't recommend playing it if you want to focus on PvP. It works better for people who tanked raids that week and want to do some battlegrounds without paying to change their talents.
---
They could. This is purely for profit maximization - how can we spend the smallest amount while still delivering an acceptable experience. It's just not as profitable to have dedicated superservers like they used back in the day. If they did, with all the advances in technology since 2004 there would be no issues.
---
This is pretty endemic to most games at this point. The only way to solve it imo is to make suboptimal playstyles really unique, because then people will play it regardless of strength. But the current system of “buff X champ/hero/class, then buff whatever is weakest next week” is just applying bandaids to a fundamentally faulty system.
---
There's still open beta too. Plenty of time
---
Classic wow ain't got time for the bullshit. Leave the game to those who have played, miss it and now get another chance at the almighty grind. 🤗
---
but they aren't offering Server transfers on Classic at this point right?
---
IMO you either end up with a hamster wheel in vertical or horizontal progression, it's just a matter of how you go about things. 
---
I prefer horizontal in this case since it means Naxx gear etc still puts a player at the peak of Vanilla power before branching off into new stuff but I do get where you're coming from 100%.
---
They promote the game more than anything.
---
&gt;Stuff isn't freely given away in Vanilla
---
Sure stuff is, people used to give away their stuff back then to help gear other people, just like today. It just seems like a lot of people seem to think everyone in vanilla wanted to be there friend, whereas today everyone already has their friends and no one seems to want to make any new ones.   
---
Hell half the memes are about people giving out free enchants/buffs.
---
The quests for most dungeons were only able to be completed in a 5 man, but before 1.10 you could enter most with 10 and before 1.3 you could enter with a full raid.
---
The size of a company doesn't mean a damn thing. Just look at how many bugs are in every Windows update.
---
Would you rather they test for only a month before release then release the game with a ton of bugs that could've been squashed had they done more testing?
---
&gt; taskmaster
---
Really though, Night Elves are slightly better than human for tanking because of the 1% dodge and the free nature resistance. Humans have a very slight advantage with threat because of weapon skill passive (very minimal as night elf has more crit by default).
---
Ah classic feels nothing better than running around buffing people
---
They have 31-60 that needs to be tested. Plus 2 other battlegrounds. The rest of the dungeons and raids.  And you want them to do that all in 1 month?
---
The people aren’t affiliated with Blizzard, they’re not endorsed by Blizzard, and Blizzard really has no control over what they say and do. It’s a win-win for Blizzard Public Relations. They get all the attention to their game from all walks of life without having to get their hands dirty.
---
Missing mane on top of head. Looks like it's bald
---
I should of added on, "retarded if you get mad about subbing and still not getting in the beta\*"
---
Its human nature to be pissed off when someone simply leeches.
---
This guy throws rocks at the mammoth from 30meters away while the rest of the tribe has to engage in close combat wielding spears? The tribe's huntsmen will eventually resent him.
---
Have a paladin do 350DPS while the warrior is at 1300 DPS in Naxxramas? These DPS classes will resent the paladin soaking up gear that could go to useful classes who carry their weight.
---
Warlocks and mages arent close to warriors and rogues, however they bring useful and very important aspects to the game. A ret or enh could be another holy or resto shaman.
---
Combine that with rets or enh wanting to raid as their spec, because then they dont have to respec and you have the perfect storm of resentment from respeccing furies, elemental shamans and the likes.
---
Also 1 in every AV
---
We’re only testing 10% of the game and there’s tons of bugs and issues. You would play a broken game just so you can play it 2 months sooner because hype?
---
Also, don't forget that in raid, multiple druid hots can NOT stack on a single target, so their numbers are limited in that regard, as well.  Don't expect more than 2-3 in a raid.
---
That might be it
---
Fantastic!
---
apparently least in the last stress test hunters were able to tame up to +2
---
So would be perfect level to test if blind hunter is broken or not
---
Asmon said he will instantly perma ban any people disclosing is server on his channel.
---
Partly why I'm gonna main priest. It just feels nice to help, ya know?
---
\*Dies to undead rogue\*
---
Nothing personell, kid
---
Man, they had so much cool stuff planned for vanilla. It bums me out that they decided to push for Burning Crusade instead.
---
And make it so you can quickly dismiss them! They often clutter my screen and glitch/multiply on private servers and the behavior is all over the place!
---
Oh! And also, you should win things by watching!
---
Yeah queue into his rank 1 group on the beta makes sense.
---
&gt; Warrior and rogue are the best DPS 
---
Naxx Fire Mage holding the ignite on the boss would like to have a word, please.
---
A % or two. Not noticeable enough to play something you may not want to play.
---
This is pure cringe.
---
truth is that in vanilla everything has its drawbacks and there will always be regret / envy of other classes, races, and professions. the grass will always seem greener, it's not like retail where you're given every tool you need to succeed so choices don't really matter. 
---
try not to be anxious about what you pick because it's just like a game of rock paper scissors. you're good here, bad there, and mediocre in other places. It's not a bad thing, it's not an amazing thing, it just is what it is
---
Fucking hell that's impressive! I love the stress severs! Okay let's do twink level 10 bis gear
---
&gt;Flying makes world smaller
---
This is the textbook definition of subjective. Flying does not affect the size of the world beyond how you feel about it.
---
The 40-50 range is WOW's version of Darwinism.

https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bvcn3i/some_ideas_on_how_they_could_add_new_content_to/epo18v2/
---
Do the @focus unitID exists in Classic (even tho the frame is not there)? Coz I heard the macros are the same from Retail.
---
God I hope there will be a streamer server list, I want to avoid them and their cancerous douchey fan base like the plague
---
Lots of games also are released broken and require day 1 patches. I'd rather wait.
---
Duskwood opened well after release, so yes it was about 4 months, the game wasn't brand new by any means, it wasn't a world first race it was just a new server.  The experience may be the same, but the experience gains are WAY higher so it goes much faster.  The 1-60 race will be about as long as expected, I am well aware of Joana's record times and the fact that most servers will probably see their first 60s after 5-6 days.
---
The answer is: not enough to matter. Play what you enjoy.
---
May the winds be at your back.
---
Feral Druid tanks can as well, it just takes a lot more work, for the effort.  (Have fun farming Manual Crowd Pummelers)
---
Problem isn't the streamers. It's the indirect destruction they cause to the playability of the game. The army of disposable, unthinking oafs that follow them around and clog the general chat is unbearable. Not to mention the 'kingship' they hold and bend the fabric of the game to their will. The point is - classic didn't have this problem. It was (mainly) all anonymous and the reputation you held was created inside the game itself, not given to you by loyal lackeys looking to be favored by their lord and savior. These pestilent, corrosive few that lap up the ichor of streamers and do their bidding is really the problem. But by virtue of proxy the streamers are to blame for not controlling their misbehaving bunch properly. It is perhaps difficult to put it into words WHY streamers are not right for the ecosystem of classic (from a standpoint that isn't concerned with business politics) and in one way or another comes down to the aforementioned reasons.
---
But hey, I'm down to a revitalized classic where we have kings and kingslayers, even though the shitflies will be surrounding them, even though they'll be gifted all gear and never have to roll, even though their path is paved in gold and will encounter none of the hardships that we might associate with progression in classic. To summarize, it isn't solely the streamer... It's the fallout.. This isn't an FPS. It's a fucking MMORPG.
---
He's referring to ruining firefall... Nothing to do with classic or other expansions.
---
Can confirm this map is 100% accurate.
---
People post these threads every day....
---
If Classic came out in 2 weeks it would be a disaster. Shit is not even close to ready. 
---
You’re clueless.
---
Yeah I'd have to agree, or at least weigh other factors such as NE increased movement speed while dead
---
Trust me, if you're anything like me and are dead for a /played time of 34 years it matters lol
---
How we feel about it
---
I did pretty well on those, and even cheaper if you picked up the limited supply items from the dealers for 5s. I was getting around 60-75s, didn't sell as many as you did as I leveled up a new alt from the first stress test.
---
Everyone is different. Quite a few people have played vanilla in its slightly different pserver iteration for the past 2-7years or even longer. Some people are just done with tinkering and enjoy the cookie cutter overlord specs like fire mage in AQ40 or a cleaving 2h fury warrior with BRE.
---
Different strokes for different folks.
---
I actually have no idea, I hadn't really looked into it directly as it's outside my scope of desired options.  I was more just thinking hypothetically I guess.
---
I have been talking to my brother now more than we have in years, all because of this game.  We talked before, but at most it was once a month.  Now we're lowbies on a private server figuring out what we're gonna roll and all that.  It's great.
---
Using item name's to tell a short story was a vanilla pass time.
---
I remember getting The Rake and bring that lion into WSG
---
Okay I'm pretty sure I'm retarded or autistic! But I thought the issue was this orc was an NPC which a paddle board that he thought was his penis. I read Phil's as phallus.....so I thought the bug was him having this massive wang... 
---
Fuck...
---
Nah, bro, do not worry or be insecure that others are out to get you with these kinds of post. The world will always have those types but it's also gonna have chill bros who are genuinely good people too!
---
&gt;...And so it came to pass that the Developer, who once bathed in the rejuvenating blood of a hundred virgins, was...
---
Wait wrong Blizzard game.
---
You're not going to get Scarab Lord, regardless if Asmon is on your realm or not. Let's be realistic here.
---
Kugen never played ultima so his opinions are that of dog shit
---
Ice cream!!
---
It would be very unbalanced to have arena in classic. I also think it would be unfair to the people who asked and expected a pure classic (the majority). It would leave a bad taste in my mouth personally if they changed the game after all these years when they have a perfectly well done game waiting after it. TBC (then wotlk! :D) or bust.
---
Chuck Norris had sex with a druid and hogger was born.
---
I loved tanaris and feralas more than any other zone AND zf is my favorite dungeon meaning my 40s was something to look forward to!
---
This comment section is proof how toxic this community is. It has kind of grown on me tbh
---
What do you mean?  Using item names to tell a short story was definitely a thing.
---
And this item was added 1.11 so it was also part of vanilla.
---
Lot's of contradictory stuff here, Like "having high caliber players" that only play raid a night or 2? That aside i've been in a guild that's similar to this and they don't work out. people drop out and you end up searching for replacements for half the raid that never bothers to show up and make no progress. Sure it starts off alright but, what your asking for is progress with out the time sink which has diminishing returns up to a point.
---
Hopefully, you can get it to work out for you though! But honestly, you should be able to find most of what you're looking for in most casual or tight-knit guilds.
---

it took me 14days playtime, also a lot of skipped classes  
---
but i got it done to 6 days played on twinks and privat servers, so if i take 2 weeks vacation and put a lock on my home office to keep the irl female out i might just be done in a month
---
Didn't you have to glitch it during taming though? Which was bannable even back then
---
#NO CHANGES
---
I think it should be brought back at very least if it ends up defining a strong meta and literally breaks the game, then deal with it, but dealing with it along side post-vanilla patch's content imo.
---
&gt; It's a valid complaint, because it's not really "earned" in a sense of more danger / higher reward. There isn't a danger on transmog runs.
---
I'm not sure I understand this concept. 
---
In Classic, players who had "good gear" were not necessarily good players. Or even completing hard content. What they had was time. They had the time and patience to do the content laid out before them. Not because it was difficult, but because it was just time consuming. Classic is designed to suck your time out because it lacked pretty much everything else. 
---
&gt; It has made me wonder if there's a better way to do transmogging that solves both being able to go back and get old gear (because people like to do that), and retains that "earned it" value. 
---
"Earned it value" is entirely subjective though. I'll say again, old raids were not hard. They were not very difficult and didn't have a lot of tough mechanics in it. I will be curious to see, but I would bet that when Classic rolls out and players get to that content, they're going to ***smash*** it. 
---
What ***WILL*** make it difficult, is the time that each person will have to spend to get to that point. That's the real barrier to entry. Not how hard the game is. Not mastering your class. Time. 
---
Is that the metric that we should be attributing to parts of the game? You have to have X amount of hours logged before you can get Y item?
---
Not talking about wow
---
Nice work! How long did it take you to make?
---
Seriously. We're already at 06/01. I've done worse waits.
---
Asmon said on stream he changed his mind later
---
I find it really fun playing by the guides sometimes. What’s wrong with that?
---
There is no such thing as tanking in retail. Threat is not an issue.  Tanks are pretty much DPS that do less damage
---
Exactly. People like different things and in a game this massive people are going to play different ways. Nobody should be shit on for going agains the grain and playing how they want.
---
It will be the 40-50 seperation coming out of the jungle of stv and into the abyssal shit
---
What's wild is claiming that a casual guild raiding 1 night a week was able to clear a raid as fast as a world first guild did. And that world first guild had more time to prepare prior to raid release.
---
That’s it, consider me converted to the religion of Omar.
---
If you dont mind me asking, what would you surmise is the best spec to maximize PvE healing, while being as good as possible at PvP healing, while being able to tank dungeons and do some light aoe grinding? In that order of importance
---
Is there such a thing? I was thinking maybe something like  [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/BPzQxMADMN8NAA](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/BPzQxMADMN8NAA)
---
You can just travel to teldrassil with any race to level there and get their mount with any ally race.
---
I have not seen a single Moonkin on the fairly populated Private server I have been playing. Even as hype for Classic grows, the player-base grows. I see a LOT of Alliance gnomes.
---
I will welcome anyone who has the patience to level moonkin to my group when it's way easier to be a cat.
---
You do not speak for everyone with an opinion.
---
Payo sucks.. Soda is pretty chilled
---
Glad I'm not the only one that can't stand Asmongold and soda :p
---
Although would be funny if people on the opposite faction come in to defend him by killing the fans and leaving the streamer.
---
Retribution Paladin is a meme spec (really shit in PVE and PVP). Sperg build is when people try to raid with their PVP build.
---
Nice, only made it to 30g after buying bis greens (about 15-20g) and guild crest (10g),so without all that I still wouldn't have been close.
---
For those wondering I think I was (one of) the first to make the green lvl 10 cloak with +2 stam. Sold them at 4g a piece. If I had done nothing but farm leather I could have made more but pvped instead :) #noregrets
---
Grats again man!
---
Not if you retain the lightning and just crap out the aftereffect.  Like keeping nutrients and ridding yourself of the useless stuff.
---
Yeah, not being world first over a year after release meant people had plenty of experience and time to read up on strats.  They didn't have guides, things are much easier after you can watch someone else do it.
---
I appreciate the feedback. I've definitely considered much of what you mention, but that's far too much to get in to in a post that was already pretty lengthy.
---
High caliber players absolutely exist that cannot commit to playing 5 nights a week. And the primary reason guilds like this "don't work" is because you don't need a guild to accomplish any of what I said on live servers. You can literally straight up PUG heroic content easy as can be.
---
I get the skepticism, because for at least the last 6+ years that's how the live world has been. Vanilla wasn't that way. You needed a guild to do Molten Core and BWL.
---
When was this said?
---
What do you make money on? Just cloth and grey items for vendoring?
---
The ones in the cave are aggro IIRC, the ones outside are not.  It's fundamentally like the Zombies/Skeletons/Bats/Wolves in the Undead zone, they are non-aggro as well.
---
Who cares? Why are you so butthurt over that lol. You will have people on both factions that wouldnt mind camping streamers. Make friends and make a counter raid to farm them? And dont forget that everyone is max level in the beta with fuck all to do so whynot world pvp?
---
Alliance must spend alot of time looking at their feet whilst backpeddling :)
---
Why do you think the level cap is 30 right now?
---
Keep watching
---
Keep me updated, sounds like a guild I would like to be a part of.
---
Also, try to avoid any servers with streamers, but since you guys want an rp server, I think your good. I don’t see any of those douchey streamers or their cancerous fan base going anywhere near rp
---
It's definitely interesting how subjective this is because my absolute favorite zone to quest in was Tanaris. I just found it awe-inspiringly beautiful.
---
Oh God that must have taken so long. It took me about 27 seconds a head with a priest with two casts, dot, renew/shield, and wand till death. I can't imagine just auto attack and judgement
---
Chuck Norris can unscramble an egg.
---
Yeh I like it. I'd be swapping divine strength points for 2/2 imp lay on hands and 2/2 unyielding faith.
---
Good thing it wasn't a horde Night Elf, things would have went south.
---
Around 3-4 hours, mostly consisting of bashing my head against the wall why the whole quest tracker was eating mouse clicks even tho it was empty and no quests were tracked
---
Dailies make the game feel like work to me. I'm losing money by not playing.
---
Trying endgame content like Uber elder is super rewarding! Not to mention you get to the juicy stuff like crafting actual good rares
---
Yeah this is definitely true. I remember being able to stack certain buffs by casting the lower rank. Some spells stacked others replaced. It was fixed.
---
Kungen probably has 1500 rating max. Lul PvEasy achievements lololol
---
It just depends on how you want to play. You can clear all the content while raid-logging if you really want to but then you'd be missing out on the majority of what classic has to offer.
---
You mention "progress" as if it is a thing when in reality content will be cleared the first time you step foot in it. 
---
Your best bet is simply getting 60 with a highly sought after class and spec and there will be plenty of "casual" guilds in which you could raid-log and see all the content.
---
Casuals are always a lot more toxic than min maxers, min maxers "elitists" stick to themselves because they attract each other.
---
Casuals are just jealous of their success and want their share of the cake without the effort and in turn just insult elitists because their opinions are different.
---
Literally no elitist gives a shit about what casuals do because they are no competition at any stage of the game, are walking gold because they fall for marketing tricks on the AH and provide free honor. Meanwhile casuals will complain about elitists, and the result is BfA.
---
Servers have no ‘announced’ population cap. Can we all stop shitposting about streamer servers? Even if their entire community quits if the streamer does (which is a very stupid assumption), your server population will still be flourishing compared to the 3K cap back in the day.
---
Fucking LOL
---
30-40 is prime Scarlet Monastery territory.
---
That is simply pathetic (to play the old metta). You gotta play whatever class and race you like. I will roll a troll mage as main and then an orc shaman (ele+resto) as alter, regardless of their viability.
---
Stress test twinky?
---
In the guild tab of the social panel I right clicked on a guild members name and an error message with jibberish popped up.
---
If it makes any difference : I'm gm and the member was an officer.
---
I meant that he wouldn't be playing 24/7 compared to others unless that changed
---
Same!
---
OP is a normie who likes instagram
---
I have this same issue with horde. I don't rly like orc. Am a fan of undead
---
Madseason's youtube videos are amazing. I played vanilla and still learned a lot from them.
---
Ragnoros was a gear check his strats were extremely base level the world first took as long as it did due to a lack of gear especially finding a balance of FR. Watching videos didn't help my guild even slightly but we raided more than once a week until we cleared it and only had to raid twice a week for Ony and MC till BWL came out. I think you are extremely under estimating the difficulty of MC we will see but I do not imagine a kill until at least 3 months after release for the best guilds and then after that most casual players will probably be 5-6 months.
---
It's second that. I'd you want to level a farming alt first, Hunter is the way to go.
---
You have the English grammar skills of a down syndrome 3 year old Russian that was raised by wolves.
---
Yea not clicking on a youtu.be link.
---
Thats what google tells me ;)
---
BTDT
---
He's not butthurt, he provided a counterpoint to the comment that streamers were being constantly ganked you idiot.
---
He cites rule 7, but his reason isn't listed under rule 7. They should update that. More over, plenty of popular threads are about the possibility of future content, such as [Vanilla Team Lead director's thoughts on how to continue after WoW Classic](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bv47mo/vanilla_team_lead_directors_thoughts_on_how_to/) which this thread is a reaction to.
---
Double more over, I think your initial reaction was against subreddit rules.
---
I'm in the same situation as you, and I don't plan to worry too much about getting people together for a guild until after classic launches. I figure enough people might drop out or get side-tracked in the time before release or even during levelling that I should worry about it when I get to 60.
---
gottem....
---
Lol. They never put enough quests in the game so when you run out go to the next zone i guess \_▪-▪_/
---
Fun Fact: In vanilla Stormwind was most often a ghost town. With it's proximity to Blackrock Mountain, Ironforge was the main player hub.
---
Try maxing in osrs
---
Was literally watching the Ascent blogs and progress during that time and their biggest issue was not having geared DPS enough to take down the adds before Rag came back and they'd end up going through 3-4 cycles and just get super far behind.
---
I was 4 When my parents played vanilla, I still remember watching my mother go through the similar process (she is a night elf) to get this exact bear. She called hers Snow.
---
Admin and soda regularly have 20k yah there's an influx but they aren't the best metrics. They're great content creators ... The downvote shills hate any objectivity when it comes to tempered measured responses. We'll see how classic goes but to say it's something so far beyond live is just blatantly false.
---
I figuered i'd pipe up and agree,i too was obsessed with petopia (i was one of the first to tame the ghost wolf in TBC, still have him today), and i am 100% certain that pets had to be your level
---
I walked from UC to westfall at 12(13?) to tame a boar there, turned out it was 1 level higher than me, ill never forget that little adventure even if it did end in dissapointment
---
yikes and also oof
---
This is partly because there was almost no gear for druid tanks when the game launched. They did add more later making it easier. I remember doing 5 mans with druid tanks without any problem, but they had feral AQ gear by then.
---
!remindme 73 days
---
QQ Streamer servers are bad, I want to play solo!!!1
---
Jesus
---
As a Hunter I hate people like you. All you did was insure that both of you are now fighting over the tame. He beat you to the punch let him have it and get the next one. 
---
When it comes to taming rare spawns I see other hunters and hunters first alliance second. 
---
Fucking with them just makes it harder for you to tame the next spawn. Eliminate competition for the spawn don’t keep it the same.
---
Look at this way. The classic dev team was given a budget of X. With that they need to make and market the game. If they choose traditional marketing then that cost will to some degree or another take away from the development. The other choice is to give access to streamers and let them do the marketing. Like you point out it isn’t a pure win win for Blizzard but the amount of attention streamers are bringing far out weighs the negatives. I think in the end we all win from the approach Blizzard is taking.
---
Then any class without fall damage mitigation would die to everyone with it.
---
I plan on playing. Have a few people in a discord, only Gankazon from Rar though. We're going horde pvp if you're interested.
---
Haha, embracing the hate. My kind of person.
---
Didn't even need to watch the video.
---
"www.fraps.com" was Nostalgia enough.
---
I disagree that's is so understandable... It doesn't need to be a tribal warfare where if you like retail or retail aspects you're a traitor to classic. There's room for enjoying both. Too many people associate things they dislike in retail with generalized statements.
---
I don't care about instagram. I don't use social media except for forums like these. If you can't see what was wrong with the clip then I can't help you.
---
I see
---
I seriously have no idea what we're talking about
---
You one of those nerds it seems.
---
And this is why people like old talents so much, lol. This build could work too, since I do want to PvP, Holy shock might be good to have. How necessary is Blessing of Sanc necessary for tanking dungeons? I know its pretty damn good for aoe farming
---
 [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/BDzcx9ADMN8MAA](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/BDzcx9ADMN8MAA)
---
that would be awesome, just dont increase the item levels to much. viable gear out of mc kept it up and running all the way into naxx. and we classic raiders enjoyed our +1 strength over the last item much more than +50itemlevel nowadays
---
bis is bis, bis doenst mean old gear has to be worthless, it only has to be slightly better to be bis
---
Only guide I'll need is a map with zone levels to remind me where to go since it's been so long. Back when I played retail I tended to level as tank or healer and just queue up. Excited to see the world again.
---
I like thunderbluff
---
Dude its just entertainment, not much more to it. They are able to make money from it which is pretty amazing, if you had the same opportunity to make millions playing wow you'd jump on it too.
---
For what?
---
Agreed.  I'd love to see them move forward with alliance-only paladins and horde-only shamans.
---
I did the exact same thing but for a ravanger!     
---
It was a great feeling everything /wowing and /cheering at my pet at low lvl
---
yeah it doesn't. I've spent way to many minutes trying to make this work on my first day in beta. It does pop up the quest when you loot that 1 of 20 bear pelts you forget about. Kind of dumb mechanic,
---
Lol what?  I watched half that video and don’t see anything wrong.
---
That's just how some YouTube links are. I think it's what the mobile app defaults it's links to?
---
Nobody gives a sweet fuck eh? BoD world first race had 100k viewers on twitch. Method generated thousands of dollars for charity during it. Uldir world first had the same.. even CoS had tens of thousands of viewers and wasn't considered by the raiding community a significant tier-like race. 
---
You're literally just spouting bullshit. Of course that's what matters in this subreddit. Don't be objective or logical... Just regurgitate the memetastic opinion classic over retail. 
---
It's fine. Keep spouting you're bullshit.
---
The difference is being able to SOLO old content from previous expansions, and having to do grouping to get it. What you say is correct, classic raids aren't difficult. But they can't be soloed until you get into BC or WOLTK.
---
I for one am going to be said streamsniping the big bois. Rogue life is going to be so much funner with people streaming these days
---
If by a bunch of randoms you mean influencers with tens of thousands of viewers daily... Then yes randoms. As far as the hype dying down. For some it will for some it wont. This is giving them made exposure though and converting a lot of skeptics. so win win for Blizzard.
---
It’s a standardised size and they grow from there :)
---
Edit: ...what have I done...
---
Id have to disagree with the others. Playing a ne warrior atm. We have aq40 on farm. Naxx is out next week. Ive played on a few of the guilds human warriors... all our warriors are pro as fuck. We all top dps every time.. tho my ne warrior is always the lowest dps of the warriors.. when i swap chars... someone else piloting it.. it still does not as good.. mind u we all have bis at this point basically.
---
Even for tanking id rather have that weapon skill for threat and rage gen..
---
It’s not just wow streamers I dislike, it’s all streamers. They’re the same as Instagram influencers, they’re whores. 
---
I have nothing against streaming, but it’s so difficult to find someone who doesn’t talk, doesn’t have them self superimposed on screen, doesn’t have some annoying jingle/hook they feel separates themselves from everyone else and every time some subscribes have another pop up on stream. 
---
Then there’s the sense of entitlement, because they have a big platform they feel they have more right to aspects of the game than other people, or even worse, like in Battlefield, they become “game changers” and suddenly become supported by the Devs and have a say in how to develop the game. 
---
Finally there’s the sycophants. It’s fine to like an online personality, just like it is to like a celebrity, but the mindless fanboying and going out of their way to do stuff they wouldn’t do for other players and the general toxicity around them is just nauseating for me.
---
I dunno about us enjoying our +1 str. 
---
The warriors in my guild LOST THEIR SHIT when they found out how little the AQ40 shoulders were an improvement over the BWL ones. Or was it boots? Either way, some folks didnt like the nearly imperceptible upgrades for all the effort
---
I do think a slower power creep is preferred. I like that MC/Ony dont give all that much better loot than dungeons. I like that some of the dungeon gear keeps up into BWL. I like that a well itemized blue dungeon gear guy, who knows how to play well can 86 average BWL geared folks.
---
* [Even's WoWC guild roster v1.0](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bvdf72/evens_wowc_guild_roster_v10/)
---
Layering no matter how you look at it is good. Like it or not, it over all is a positive thing to come along. I know there are purists that say enjoy your 4hr ques and your lag. That's just stupid tho. Under no circumstance do I want to wait to play classic, even if it is the more faithful experience.
---
Chuck Norris once won a staring contest against C’Thun.
---
Just with the glancing blow damage reduction 5 weapon skill going from 300 to 305 is about 5% more total dps, that doesn't factor in the extra rage you gain from harder hitting glancing blows. The weapon skill is extremely valuable at low levels of gear, and loses value as you gain more gear. Better gear is more rage, more rage is more auto attacks converted to special attacks (Heroic Strike/Cleave) and specials cannot glance. If you are 2h fury then it's about 5-7% at pre raid-bis / Molten Core gear levels, but significantly less when dual wielding because Edgemaster's Handguards vs. Devilsaur Set is not that big of a deal.
---
Literally nothing is wrong with the clip, why are you trying to imagine things
---
Probably that guy that levels to 60 only killing boars.
---
Either way I'm not clicking as I'm at work anyway. If it works though, if you don't mind me asking which streamer?
---
Mulgore just feels bigger because of the Tauren walking animation. And while it's true that there are quests that have rather long walking distances, Mulgore doesn't have the Echo Isles, so there is that.
---
I just hope to God they release the names of the servers before so we can, as a community, figure out what servers the streamers will be on and we can roll on different servers.
---
I am aware of these facts but thank you
---
Just play in the zone your race starts in. 
---
Last thing you want is to run an Orc Warrior over to Mulgore and only get 2H maces as quest rewards.
---
tldr; OP is mad that streamers have beta and he doesn't
---
if you watch the video of him playing in the stress test they are yellow mobs in the cave not red.
---
There is only one required endgame profession as dps... and that is engineering. So... you can pick any thing after that. Me personally. I have bs for the  fear breaking trinket, and engineering for pvp viability and endgame raid dos and tank requirements
---
Yeah i left before it went downhill (as ive read and been told from my buddies) but i cant imagine even the purist wanting to keep wow classic just vanilla forever. If this gives Blizzard x amount of new/returning subs (and are retained) they are going to have to do something 2-3 years down the road regardless. Maybe even sooner since the overall game knowledge is much higher so people will blow through classic. 
---
Based off this post. It sounds like they are already thinking about changes at some point, but it still is too early to tell. But if they separate classic and classic + (ie some added content, progression to TBC and WotLK etc) i think that's where the sweet spot will be. Purist will be happy and people that want progression and new/old  content will be happy. But it all comes down to the $$ so time will tell. 
---
I mean if they were able to develop a WoW 2 with a modern engine, but the same principles as vanilla, that would be money. But thats probably a pipe dream at this point.
---
Sometimes having a specific reason ruins all the other reasons to go though.
---
You're projecting a bit I think. People group up with others that have similar interests all the time, like reddit guilds for example.
---
I was a heavy user of addons in Vanilla as well, and remain so to this day. Having fancy interface doesn't change the class balance and content of the game that we all love. So you can take your gatekeeping elsewhere :3
---
The giant hit box is blizzlike.
---
Do you not have addons in classic?
---
There will be streamers on every server. If you aren't watching them you won't even notice.
---
It’s okay to be minmaxed.
---
Anyone that ever cared about gamergate one way or the other is someone that I guarantee is someone you should laugh at. Not even for their stance on gamergate even, it just attracted the most hilarious spergs and attention whores.
---
I agree agility is important but I do not think that people will be leveling 1-40 as fury without the sitting to proc enrage
---
just for clarification, everything I said is for vanilla/ps. Not live. I don't know how retail raiding works anymore (i assume you click a button and rush to target dummy that's shaped like a boss hehe). But if you can find/form a guild that has all the things you mention and they make it work that would be great. Classic will have a much larger player budget than ps did, So maybe you can make it work.
---
During stress test esfand tried to make “bootylicious” and it was deemed inappropriate. He made assmuncher instead and apparently thats fine by blizz.
---
Exiled legends
---
I think they did for the reason, yes. Blizzard went after obfuscated addons before, and it's spelled out in the terms.
---
Your pve world set is going to be high stam high crit pvp gear^ with a two hamder if you are on a pvp world.
---
Exactly, people are way overreacting to how streamers are going to effect the server. Sure there will be some problems, but honestly I think the unique community events streamers can bring to a server are going to be a lot of fun, and something that will only take place on their server.
---
Not only is this just wrong, it’s wrong on multiple levels. You can train gathering professions to 300 at 25. But even if that wasn’t the case it’s still an absolutely brain dead comment because you don’t need to be able to pick an herb for it to show up on your minimap.
---
I don't remember how it functioned with talented versions. I definitely wasn't clever enough to save points to slowly down tank my marks though. That would be pretty meta lol
---
I thought these were the new heat seeking arrows.
---
Has there been a comparison done on the beta between 2h fury vs arms leveling speeds?
---
More cringe maybe?
---
Yes, it's too long. There aren't enough players in the beta. They probably didn't want to invite many people in case it ruined the streamer experience. My suggestion would be to not watch any content and just wait for release.
---
As others have said it's generally not worth it to go deep prot early on, and actually is only questionably worth it ever.
---
You get most of your value with improved shield block, anticipation, toughness, and defiance.  After that there's not much value until shield slam (though 1h spec is ok).
---
If you're talking about retro wow I wouldn't put too much credence into their numbers that's server is jank af.
---
I'm playing there this summer tho to learn to tank like a pro
---
This is a stupid argument. Every single hunter focused on PvP would try to get this broken and overpowered pet. It's not feature, it's a bug and people were actually banned on pservers for exploiting this.
---
I don't feel like you can call it toxic.
---
Previous games have shown streamer servers are max cancer not because of the streamer but the people who follow them.
---
I for one would rather not be on a streamer server just to avoid all that. I have nothing against streamers they can do their thing but i don't want to be apart of it.
---
There's a comment like yours in every one of these threads, a'd a general thread like yours every day.
---
??? What? Do I not have addons in Classic? I just told you I've been u sing addons since Vanilla. I use addons because the interface is inadequate and always has been. Hence my criticism. What are you even saying now?
---
the streamer life chose them
---
Step 1: goto eBay
---
Step 2: buy a account with beta access
---
Step 3: ??????
---
Step 4: get burned out so I don't see you on release
---
i feel like i have no words for this.  why would anyone even want to be a part of such a boring shitshow?  not for me at all.  
---
just had a thought though.  maybe rp servers would be relatively safe from most of these guys.  are there even going to be rp servers?
---
A solid plan. I am going skinning/mining.
---
I love skinning my kills. Feels so good and you can do it in Cat form.
---
I really like enchanting but it's so damn expensive. I would likely pick it up much later on.
---
You’re a dumb whore with a fat ass, did you know that?
---
Petopia, if it’s still catalogues the differences between the xpacs.
---
No you can purge sl off the lock on pservers, which isn't blizzlike. But it's easily fixed by stacking all your buffs and noggenfoggers
---
Not sure if meme’ing or assburgers.
---
I certainly understand that and I was even using them myself during vanilla because it's a significant QoL improvement if you're just trying to rush max level. I don't have the same mindset our interests this time around, so we shall see.
---
And what I was saying was that *just* not adding levels isn't enough to solve the expansion problem.
---
There's a deeper, foundational issue with adding vertical power progression content to Theme Park MMOs. Levels are just a layer on top of deeper mechanics that need to be rethought.
---
We aren't allowed to give names of such servers in this community and I certainly don't want to give out any clues either as I don't want to be banned a **THIRD TIME.**
---
Sargeras
---
Damn, that 20/31 build is tempting. I’ve known I’m maining Paladin for a while now, but never considered how possible it was to hybrid. I don’t have any desire to DPS at 60, but being able to tank *and* heal? Sign me the fuck up! It’s not like Molten Core is that demanding anyways, so i doubt any guilds would give me shit for it. And if I ever want to DPS, that’s what my alt is for... 
---
Thanks for listing these builds, it’s gotten me even more excited for playing Pally in Classic.
---
This made me ugly cackle
---
Tldr: op is mad that soda said gay shit/sex doll. Kind of retarded isn't it?
---
did you never form guild alliances?  i was in the same situation with my guild but we became friends with other small guilds like ours and never really had much trouble getting a dungeon or raid group together.
---
I think you need to go outside more.
---
Hey dude just curious what your full color giant WoW tattoo looks like 4 years later. Also how did people react to your tattoo IRL over the last 4 years. Happy you got it?
---
Gotta speak to the queen of cards daily and shut that shit down.
---
Insecurities. People don’t want to be wrong. People don’t want to have to prove all the shit they lied about 15 years ago. People resent pserver guys for knowing more about “their game”. 
---
In other words, manbabies
---
Are people really this dumb? :/
---
Classic had a fuckton of add ons. People had boss timers, that auto heal mods, decursive, and auto fish mods.
---
In my opinion you're going to fall into one of a few categories:
---
1. Quit instantly because classic is not your jam (1-3 days)
---
2. Quit at level 30-40 because you fell behind the curve and STV is full of autism (2-7 days)
---
3. Quit after getting pre-bis because raiding sucks and hunters keep stealing your leather shoulders (14-30 days)
---
4. Quit during MC because you thought you'd enjoy raiding, but it sucks (30-45 days)
---
5. Quit shortly after getting your PvP weapon when you realize your team doesn't lose anymore (30-90 days)
---
6. Quit deep into raiding progression because your guild switched to Loot Council  (1 year)
---
Weird seeing this guy getting so much positive attention here. I have to assume most of the people on this sub arent familiar with his reputation post-Blizzard.
---
Played on Shadowsong.  Was part of Blood of the Alliance, then merged with Atrum Mortis.  Played a druid as well.
---
/wave
---
I want into the Closed Beta.
---
I think 45-52 is probably one of the easier parts honestly, however, I'd change the original post to 30-45 being the rough part. 45-52 you've got:
---
* zf/mara quests
---
* start hinterlands
---
* searing gorge
---
* azshara
---
* hinterlands elites
---
* blasted lands
---
* wpl
---
* ungoro
---
I dont understand why you are arguing against classic. The point is to bring back a close to authentic wow vanilla experience. Use add ons if you dont like it.
---
I know I'm making a mage for my first character just because I prefer ranged dps and they have a ton of farming potential. I'm fairly sure I'm rolling alliance too because I prefer stormwind/ironforge to org. Human males look shit so I'm either going female human or male gnome. Or female gnome.. Hmm.. I'll be deciding this up until launch day 😂
---
Woulda been smart.
---
Uhm i was at the aq opening and it was like 3fps(PC problem) and its 10+ seconds delay on everything all the time. At least that's how I remember it but it was probably even worse because I was a lot more tolerant of lagg back then.
---
Is this a for sure thing?
---
IRONFORGE_MASTERCITY 420 BLAZE IT
---
Who is this APES crew?
---
I go outside lol.
---
cant comment on beta cuz im not an "influencer" but, MS (arms) was slightly better for leveling then fury generally.
---
for the early levels you basically only have rend/HS/Tclap as non auto attack damage, so imp rend slightly helps here.
---
flurry is the big dps increase for fury, but with minimal crit from gear while leveling, flurry uptime is inconsistent and therefore doesnt contribute significant dps.
---
im not sure how much data exists comparing an "optimally efficient leveling route" but MS was generally regarded as better for leveling in nilla.
---
They are one the the biggest game companies in the world because they make smart decisions... like having a closed beta where they don’t have to pay any compensation to the testers from the budget.
---
Do not know any employees so sadness.
---
Haha what
---
Mommy this grown man said gay! Is this ok?
---
 /ctw
---
Dwarf Priest is the legit only combination imo that is actually pretty huge.
---
Having Fear Ward in PVP is huge as Alliance (we don't have Will of the Forsaken) and every raid in Vanilla wow has at least 1 encounter with a fear mechanic.
---
The rest is whatever play the race you like.
---
This is my most important goal for classic as of now, Avoid Streamers.
---
Uh oh
---
No one has trouble understanding that.
---
wtf?
---
I would main a Troll Warrior if they had Dual Wield Throwing Spears and Berserker War Paint(as Armor) 
---
My favorite unit is and always will be the Troll Berserkers in Warcraft 3 
---
I Love the Tauren but wish I could equip a Giant Totem as a two handed Blunt weapon like in the Original WoW trailer but sadly it’s still absent from the game despite being in Warcraft 3 just like the Berserkers are 
---
I wanna Bitch slap some Alliance with my Totem
---
Emotional. I like it
---
I think it's the latter. This is pretty cringe.
---
They cant enforce it since they are too distracted by their streams to even communicate in-game 90% of the time.  I've never given any of the top streamers in my guild shit.  The sheer mass of regular players in the guild though makes it nice.
---
Any yeah, all if the top streamers will probably be on 1 or two pvp servers and that's it. The ones that aren't good at pvp will avoid the other streamers servers.  RP servers should be clear but suffer from traditionally lower populations in general.
---
Chuck Norris is so manly that he flosses with dual wielding Gorehowl's. (This was before titan's grip was a thing)
---
Why does it make you sick?
---
Are you a shareholder?
---
But I want to play it NOW! NOW NOW NOW!!!
---
Haha nothing u can ignore me I was just making a joke cuz most of those places are horde dominated.
---
I quest at ashenvale and briefly at stonetalon as Alli but don't go to hillsbrad much
---
Fuck I want to do something like this as a project to have in my resume for internships. Any advice on getting started on addons?
---
Gods I was strong then!
---
that might have been the case back in 08 but if we keep in mind we want to have the vanilla feeling even if they ever put in new content overpowered items are the fastest way to ruin everything again.
---
yes everyone likes upgrades but as i stated, an upgrade is an upgrade even with only +1, you still got the bragging rights for owning that item, which to be honest is also a big part of the vanilla feeling. to see a char and know that weapon / set / whatever is from boss x in raid y and not just transmoged
---
Lol fucked it up...
---
So I guess you wont be playing right?
---
Summit shroud lirik, they not gonna play at launch right?
---
They wont have 300k+ viewers on offpeak hours on 8/26-8/28 right?
---
its just celebrities, but a bit more "up close"
---
You mean another top3? Because 3 ppl from my friend's list already got the invites.
---
It's easier to raid on Alliance, so there're usually more hardcore raiding guilds on Alliance. Gear &gt; all so maybe it's the reason.
---
I'm pretty sure there can be a Horde premade that wrecks most of the Alliance premades.
---
No one else gets paid to sit and play for 16 hours a day. You can't run a house, a car and yourself on unpaid 16 hours a day. Average people talking into microphones and meme culturing barely pull 10 viewers, they've been at this for far too long now.
---
Nah
---
Play nelf then. Unless you want to minmax it won't matter that much. IIrc rogues have higher stealthlevel e.g.
---
Nelf rogue is optimal for combat dagger in PvE, could get a niche that way. Lots of guilds will want to run 1-2 dagger rogues just so those daggers are not dead loot :P
---
Not all caped people are heroes
---
Each servers were very different in that regard. "Generally considered" in most of the threads here are based on one or two private servers full of min-max.
---
Is there a specific language you used for addons or can you use anything ?
---
in 1.12 any alliance race can have any ally mount (few exceptions due to size)
---
Ah, this is duskwood redridge time I assume
---
I don't think that'd be a problem in case of card games. It'd basically be like back in the day where people where played MTG in some gaming stores, and their friends would just hang out there.
---
Yes, more cringe. The whole thing is cringe.
---
I was a paladin in the stress test. You better believe I mighted just about everyone I saw. Even casters. Because you know, 2 spell OOM
---
We were neck deep in Wrath in 08. 
---
I agree with you, it just doesnt feel good to get a +1 str upgrade, regardless of it its better for the long term health of the game. I like to think I see the forest through the trees on that issue, not everyone does.
---
does it at least have a unique look?
---
I only felt burned out and weak at the 0's. 20,  30, 40 ect. At your weakest for bg's. I'll probably feel different this time though as I started right when wsg came out so and this time I'll start at launch.
---
Thus far I have found the following errors;
---
Stanglehorn Vale,  Hillsbrad Foolhills, Aralhi Highlands
---
Hands down one of my favorite parts of Classic has been running around buffing people
---
I don't want to divulge too much of my route just cuz I want as few people on it for classic as possible -- cuz obviously everyone is going to be following me around duh -- but I go to all those places between 17 and 28 , except hillsbrad.
---
When I first started I spent an inordinate amount of time just running around the world looking at stuff. I picked leatherworking and spent a few days grinding leather on grey mobs. I did some quests, I randomly ran around. Did a few more. Spent an age getting Deadmines groups together. Made it to STV. Engaged in the world pvp. Switched to mining engineering. Spent ages gathering mats. Grinded some rep. Gave up. Grinded feralas naga for pearls to sell. Did some more quests. Ran away from devilsaurs. Hit 60 after about.... 4 months or so. Still hadn't a clue what I was doing, raided lbrs and ubrs in 9 man class runs. Glorious times.
---
this isn't accurate.  Warriors had difficulty in general without gear.  once you are geared you become at least as competitive as most classes in group pvp, even as a solo pug. In group pvp with a competent healer, you become an unstoppable killing machine (ironically more from BoF and snare dispells then from the heals).
---
1v1, warriors suffer from the same scissors paper rock as everyone (except maybe shadow priests).  You will shit on most rogues unless there is a huge skill/gear disparity, but will get beat by most frost mages in the same manner.
---
there are many classes a war trumps 1v1, but you cant expect to win every 1v1 situation regardless of what class you are playing as (except maybe shadow priest.)
---
I'm not arguing against Classic. I'm arguing against Blizzard's scuffed UI that has existed since Classic. Calm down.
---
yes, paladins. paladins enable warriors, who are the unstoppable killing machines of WoW.
---
Great, that red glow in Durotar/Barrens was pretty bad. 
---
I don't have the beta but even watching streams was unbearable after 5 minutes.
---
I can't see myself playing anything other than wow for years to come if this is the case
---
&gt;For example, best horde race for warrior in PvE tanking? Or even PvE DPS?
---
I mean Orc does strictly more damage then Tauren in PvE because Tauren have more health and Orcs get Blood fury. For tanking its whatever but if the extra health isnt keeping you alive then its Orc obviously.
---
&gt;Best alliance hunter race for PvP? Etc.
---
I mean it obviously depends on whether you want stoneform or Shadowmeld. Which is going to depend on what the class you are fighting is. NE is strictly better dps in PvE though.
---
Obviously these differences aren't huge but it sounds like you are trying to say people don't know the trade offs of either one but we do.
---
I hate these posts. People must realize that there are waaay more posts saying: ‘Just do what you want, maaaan. Don’t let the elitists tell you what to do, maaaan’ than posts actually talking about min-maxing hard, right? Stop and smell the fucking roses if you want, but do you have to jerk eachother off about it all day long? We get it
---
Have you stopped to think that maybe people have the most fun by min-maxing as much as possible?
---
Okay, its classic. It's supposed to be unrefined. I dont think you understand classic.
---
Damn this is awesome. I started WoW late in vanilla as a dwarf hunter and ran across Bjarn around level 8 or so. He killed me, and being such a noob I rezzed at the spirit healer and was super depressed because I couldn’t really figure out where I was when I died. Who knows if I would ever find Bjarn again. By chance, I ran into him a couple days later, and after some encouragement from my friends I actually managed to tame him. I immediately renamed him back to Bjarn and he served as my ONLY pet until I got laughed at in my first Gruul’s Lair raid in TBC. Something about not having this glitchy scorpion pet that stacked poison DoTs or whatever was the flavor at the time. Eventually that bug got fixed, I never used a scorpion, but did switch to a cat for raiding.  But you gotta know that I always kept Bjarn around for soloing and random other things. Fuckin bear was with me for like 6 years of WoW haha.
---
I'll be maining feral druid, as I always have. I played UD rogue on the stress test though so I didn't care about wiped progress as much.
---
Does this command reset on relog/reload of game?
---
This is disingenuous, ret does about 600-800 dps in Naxx progression. Ret also doesn’t take up a healer spot, yet still provide all the benefits of a paladin.
---
He [started streaming](https://www.twitch.tv/madseasonshow/) just few days ago
---
I used thrash blade in MC on pserver until I got Brut blade. Thrash blade*mirahs song, couldn’t get dal rends to drop
---
Wasn't this exact thing posted earlier, but for WC?
---
WoW addons are written in LUA.
---
Huge amount i dislike about TBC, #1 is the arena. Bgs are so much better as pvp content.
---
I thought they were using the same models and textures that were seen in 1.12?  Didn't the presentation at blizzcon make that clear?  Are these not the models and textures from 1.12?
---
I really hope Blizz reconsiders this. All the polls I've seen have shown the RP-PvP server being more popular than a normal RP one. They should at least make one.
---
This has been my biggest pet peeve in regards to WoW. I always thought it was bonkers that content becomes irrelevant so quickly. All those man hours of development have suddenly become null and void.
---
Summer.
---
Go download addons and look at the code. Look at the code for the default UI (which are built as official addons). Learn how to program in LUA.
---
\-but muh world pvp. :c
---
Isle Of Dread: What was this place for?
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/AzzAzAUzDiPENAA
---
Basically full fury with all the bits that give you minor extra bits of avoidance. 
---
If you prefer arms you'd do something similar like 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/BTzB_EwQAjMMAA
---
I've left out extra points that you don't need to get the defensives that can be put where ever you prefer. 
---
I've put points in blood craze (health Regen t3 fury) but the the 3% over 10 secs is pretty meh and you could easily put these in any of the talents that improve your shouts (imp demo shout might even equate to a higher EH I'm not sure of the theory crafting)
---
You were able to tame him even though he was higher level than you? Interesting that doesn’t work on pservers. Not surprised it’s off.
---
You are a legend!
---
 !RemindMe 79 days
---
Human is not gonna give you 5% that would be ridiculously OP.  
---
It's a little less than that.
---
Great map but I don't see the sewer entrance?
---
When playing a night elf hunter an error came up when talking to the stable master. After I trained the spider in the first taming quest I talked to the stable master, in the window that came up was a green smiley face that you see for pet status, and when I moused over it an error would come up. it opened in another window with a bunch of script that i did not understand, and i apologize i was too tired to take a picture or look at it more closely. but one of the buttons available to click was “reload ui” and the other was just “cancel”. I wasnt able to stable the pet as this error just kept coming up. 
---
not sure if it had something to do with being on the taming quest still? i didnt manage to finish the taming quest before the stress test ended. 
---
Sorry i cant be more specific, i was just confused by it and too tired to really commit it to memory.
---
I think it has more to do with a lore standpoint, which tauren and draenei are probably both against such dishonorable ways and the like
---
Tauren main right over there
---
This right here would be my desire. Expand to 70 with the lvl 70 skills and classes as they were in TBC but just don’t expand into Outland. Expand in into Azeroth. Incorporate pieces that were planned for vanilla that were cut.  Stay with the no flying concept.  I just feel the classes / specs are in a far better spot in TBC than vanilla.
---
Right? XD
---
Dare I ever say anything bad about Blizzard's UI, meanwhile I guarantee anyone who downvotes my opinion on the matter will be using addons themselves. Hypocrites.
---
Are you joking? Trade chat, world chat, barrens chat, will be all about them and their antics
---
Demo shout is not much threat at all.  Druids are actually really good in terms of threat scaling in vanilla and could be better than warriors with Mannual crowd pummellers if they had them.
---
Tirisfal glades is best. Easier getting to spf.
---
Pfff, you min maxer! I levelled resto open world using catform. Took 5 months to hit 60 and about 20 seconds TTK on same level jobs. Even after the 1.8 (?) Talent overhaul I went back to resto catform. Never died really though...
---
Sounds like you’re looking for retail, casual
---
is this thing missing several flight paths or were these added later?
---
un'goro, silithus, camp taurajo, burning steppes, searing gorge, hinterlands
---
I think someone said there's only one other purely white bear.  
---
Either way he found a way to enjoy himself thoroughly without any direction and imo that's like the entire point of classic
---
I love finding pets this way. I ran from Teldrassil to Mulgore to get Mazzranache. It was the most satisfying tame I had in game.
---
Say you wander in an area, and get the tag on a rare mob first. You down it. All of a sudden, you're bombarded by whispers of Kys, f u, die, etc. Etc.
---
Simply because you killed a rare asmons monkey ass saw, and hes blaming you for stream sniping. Even tho you dont watch his piddly ass.
---
Streamers themselves arent the issue, but the rabid blight of circlejerking fanboys at thier backs are beyond disruptive to other players.
---
&gt; Fucking thing glitched and just popped out of existence on me
---
You mean you forgot to feed it and it starved to death.
---
Sure bud
---
Twas a fine build, went to ZG with it
---
Arcane priest over here, yeah you read that right - Nightelfs get starshards, which is like arcane missiles, only worse. Horrible spec, but very fun for me to play. I'll 1v1 anyone
---
Oof, you really aren't getting the point of what I'm saying do you. /r/woosh
---
Search around the sub a bit for this flight path map. Someone posted an updated version earlier this week or late last week with a bunch of spelling updates.
---
I was 15 when I started playing wow and definitely didn’t know how to pirate addons. Also didn’t have a way to electronically pay for addons. It might have cost money to begin with, but either knock offs were quickly created or they stopped changing for it.
---
You seem like the moron here.
---
Yeah it sure would suck to have interesting encounters constantly on your stream, when your viewers only want to watch a tedious grind
---
My very first toon on WoW was a Druid. I ran Balance spec on her. I'm amazed I didn't quit. Granted, when BC rolled around I played her again and loved it.
---
Yeah but on a stronger engine and a higher resolution. I dont really know how it all works but i imagine shading/lighting and stuff like hround clutter make a noticavle difference
---
They are but it's a modern client with improved performance and graphics. For example you can see models cast shadows instead of that black halo that the classic client had.
---
Lol okay secret man. I'm thinking of rolling an ally to ~30 to try their early zones! Never have
---
Bing, pserver user found!
---
That's mostly due to a bug in how the system aggregates rolling ignites.  If you only have 1 mage, the ignite damage they get won't be impressive.
---
He looks like this guy  https://twitter.com/rickyberwick/status/1100543732536041473

Just click the big letters and hit send and the bot will remind you too.
---
It's called a chat box.
---
Discord covers it, why would they want to do the work for something that exists?
---
/p
---
For sure they would need to make it harder. I just want my properly horned raptor. I'm willing to put in the work lol.
---
If you can't complete a 15 year old raid with modern computers/internet connection/tactics, it's not the fault of sub-optimal race choices
---
If one thinks a fluster cluck is interesting I guess
---
if you are prot (or just don't mind tanking), the best way to make money is reserving the first righteous orb every strath run.  
---
getting your group to get you the UBRS key can also be lucrative for key service.
---
If you are dps you can grind the ogres in Burning Steppes pretty efficiently and they drop runecloth and a couple silver.
---
yes, some of the non elite mobs on retro-wow are scaled to be group mobs so dont trust that.
---
If someone is looking for a priest, it's very doubtful they'll have the option to pick between two priests in the first place. Everyone is happy that the priest exists at all.
---
I’d be OK with it, but I know the #nochanges crowd won’t be.  But it also doesn’t matter to me at all.  It’s extremely easy to just get people into a Discord server if they have any interest in voice chatting.
---
Thats okay, people haven't been able to enjoy it in roughly 15 years as of now. We've gone this long without it but now can't fathom the thought of future players not being able to play it?
---
Try coming from a diablo 2 paladin to wow lol
---
The client is the game engine. The new client just uses the old models.
---
Upvoted. I like how simple it is. Some others I have seen are far to graphical and have very little info. This is perfect.
---
I think it will really depend on what you are looking for. I would say Mulgore is the prettiest, Durotar the most nosfalgic one and Tirisfal the most interesting one. Take your pick. (Mine will be Mulgore)
---
...dont wear leather
---
The alliance “advantage” applies to only ultra-organized pvp. Paladins are amazing in a big group especially when they can just healbot a warrior with freedom. 
---
Horde arguably have an advantage in less organized pvp because their “healers” can better assist with damage, and key totems are unlikely to get killed or played-around. Horde racials are arguably better also.
---
Won't there be pve servers?
---
A must have for any Hunter
---
Horde side theres some great players sonii/veruki/Kala/payo/ 
---
Sadly on alliance side the only one i can stand is esfand
---
No. Wow rolled out their own voice chat and it was literal trash. Eveyrone used Ventrillo back in the day and everyone will use Discord now if they *really* need voice chat for pugs.  
---
You can also just- Type and use the various chat channels in game. Like everyone else will be doing.
---
Is there documentation provided by blizzard on scripting? Looks like theres lots of helper methods/functionality you used, that i'd have no idea existed if I didn't look at the code.
---
I wasn't sure if you were sarcastic to me or sarcastic to this sub. Since I wasn't sure, I didn't shot fire. Glad we were agree after all. :)
---
Far too drunk... I might piss myself!!!
---
This is true, especially if you're going to focus on PvE. This game is very easy, you hardly need to minmax.
---
Add swifty to the chill list
---
Yeah I'd turn down bears because fuck furries. Go Yiff elsewhere.
---
Thank God there is no level scaling. I would choose to die 50 times until I get it, but please no level scaling. The worst thing Blizzard did to the game.
---
Sorry if I miss the joke here, but that is what happens when your bow and melee wep break from memory this happened all the way until Wrath. I remember hitting Lady Vash with my quiver on the kill attempt.
---
Welcome
---
That fucking card game would be crazy cool
---
He should be working on classic , i dont care what bridges i assume he burnt at some point in the past
---
Found the special snowflake
---
Im sure, but that's not the question I was answering.
---
I'd honestly prefer to just type to strangers, and perhaps voice chat to them if they become friends via Discord.
---
Haha dm me if you are really curious or planning to roll Alli and ill send you the speed leveling guide I use for Alli side
---
I mean- I'd be annoyed at adults using insults a 10 year old in the 90's would use myself. Seems some people don't grow out of their dumb years.
---
I remember they tried to add voice chat to wow in vanilla, and it was just really shitty and low quality.
---
didnt take me 24 hours though :p
---
It's not offensive cause it's not an insult, it simply speaks volumes about the person trying to use it as an insult.
---
I guess I just dont think what he's done post-Blizzard changes how interesting hearing him talk about WoW development is.
---
You are dumb as fuck if you actually think this
---
Why? You, as a player, are doing what its needed to bring the boss down, if somebody else does it better it doesn't make you worse.
---
Lets put another example: in PvP, warsong. If you get a warlock that can win 100% of the time, but it takes 10 minutes, and get grouped with a druid, that wins 100% of the time in 5 mins, you didn't get carried, if the druid was or wasn't in the match didn't mattered, because you would have won anyway, it just faster.
---
To be carried implies that you only managed to do it because somebody else was overperforming
---
Woo! White characters are the best.
---
Imagine the original developers came back and released a new patch within classic with some of these updates ..god help us all
---
There are other immersive things like carnivores killing vermin NPCs, too.
---
You get an upvote because I think downvotes are stupid.
---
That was possibly the best part of TBC and a big reason why it is so fondly remembered by hybrid spec players in particular.
---
You wanna watch the clip before typing any more? Thanks bud.
---
When Chuck Norris jumps into a lake, he doesn't get wet. The lake gets Chuck Norris
---
Ah ok thanks for the info. Been outa the loop for a long time
---
You get an upvote because Taurens rule and Orcs drool!
---
I hope you made fun of him for clicking and backpedaling.
---
If you see your opponent as a warrior and can choose how to engage, there are many classes you can beat 1v1 
---
However in most of the realistic situations regarding world PvP (aka being ganked while fighting a mob) you are just fucked, especially without gear
---
Is that really the tickrate of the server for spell / hit effects?
---
That's huge - does that mean that if I pop a health potion in &lt; 400ms before a fatal blow, I'll still die?
---
True, but I see there's a small difference between having to still invite, setup a server and communicate via third-party app compared to having it ready to go.
---
It actually already has this as a hold over from the BFA infrastructure, not sure if it's being removed...
---
the nature of warrior abilities, many of which require a specific stance, weapon, or both, creates a very high skill ceiling.
---
furthermore, warriors have many "tricks" (mostly in pvp) that many people dont utilize, but allow them to shine.
---
taunting pets is the best example. pet aggro gives you a consistent damage stream to break incapacitating effects, pet crits are weak but still trigger enrage, and if they are attacking you they arent messing up cast bars of your teammates.
---
I guess i like the NE one best
---
search on ebay or amazon for strapless panties
---
Which way into town? 
---
Back the way you came.
---
rage management
---
No thanks, fam. I'm good. I was more eyeballing your 10 year old level insult.
---
Thanks that all makes sense. They really are both 50/50 for me. Worst case scenario I end up playing both I guess. :P
---
do you know what the exceptions are? i just know mechanostrider is dwarf/gnome only but im not sure about any others
---
I wouldn't mind watching a little war happen between streamer armies and be able to chip in if I feel like it.
---
I'd still try to avoid where streamers are in general, but they are sometimes involved in fun "events" that might not happen otherwise.
---
You say back in the day, I say they have no reason to change that cap. Once layering goes away you can expect the servers to be 2500-3k capped. Unless you have some proof of them saying they will be changing core systems for the hell of it.
---
My brother loved making hunters.  Regardless of what race he always managed to get to mulgore and get the rake
---
I dunno man, they cleared BT pretty fast and some of them with some leftover vanilla raid gear. I think his take is probably appropriate for him specifically, but not the rest of the population that isn't going for world firsts.
---
It works, yes. I see people using it all the time when I'm watching streams
---
I like how there's a few naked night elves and a dude not paying attention at the top
---
Why even click the thread then lol. No insults were thrown around either, but you choose to get offended anyway. How sad.
---
I just noticed Pshero had the beta today. I queued into him during one of my first WSGs of the day.
---
That's hardly a reason to be against voice chat. I mean obviously it has to be done correctly.
---
I can't believe how much time you waste on this sub just to complain
---
Oh my god!!!
---
nice, thanks
---
Typically every game goes open beta after closed.
---
Well for starters there is the WeakAuras wiki page for [setting up a dev environment](https://github.com/WeakAuras/WeakAuras2/wiki/Lua-Dev-Environment), this MMO-Champion thread for [Creating Your First Addon](https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/817817-Creating-Your-Own-WoW-Addon), the [WoW AddOns] (https://discord.gg/J9VUQ5g) discord and [Wowpedia Interface customization](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Wowpedia:Interface_customization) page
---
Best is to just open a simple addon and check the source code how they do it
---
&gt; If you can't see what was wrong with the clip then I can't help you.
---
You're aware that your basis for objection is entirely subjective right?
---
Saying the quality of voice chat was bad is a terrible excuse to not want voice chat. There's many reasons not to want voice chat but because it used to be bad quality isn't a good one.
---
 !RemindMe 73 days
---
Am I supposed to know who any of these people are or is it just a made up story?
---
For those wondering, the statue was made by figureprints. They're still around and pull from your character's armory!

I think watching people play video games is one of the dumbest trends today...
---
...with that said, I would probably watch you try to pull this off.
---
Wow exploiting out of WSG? i'm pretty sure half off the people did some sort of exploiting in vanilla when you could get literally anywhere unintended for players. grow up.
---
You look 57 and 23 at the same time, impressive.
---
But seriously, this is honestly one of the most retarded things I've ever read and watched.
---
Dwarves are the best
---
Won't be needed. They will either be given a head start of a day or so to get their names or blizz will have already locked out those names so that only they can get them.
---
Yeah wouldn't want layering, new graphics, battlenet, itemization changes, patch progression changes, 1.12 talents instead of progressive, right click report, new pop cap, XR BG's from start etc.
---
I had some epic fantasy music playing in the background while I read this title and it gave me tingles. Gratz on the pet!
---
I mostly agree, but don't expand to level 70, it completely trivializes the previous content. Just keep the cap at level 60 and add more content instead.
---
undead have the best by far
---
Here's a headsup for all of you pure dps warriors. Chances are you will have to tank at some point in raiding. Always bring a shield and be quick to taunt a wandering mob if shit hits the fan. It doesn't take skill to stand still mashing bloodthirst. It takes skill to be quick on your toes and save the raid from a wipe. Warriors who can manage that are usually noticed for it and will be rewarded.
---
But what about Omar?
---
That’s the pet I’ve always gone for since TBC. For RP my night elf hunter is mind controlled by the spider and is gathering intel in preparation for the great spider uprising.
---
Nope.
---
Since TBC came out i didnt touch any Vanilla server, logged in the stress server played for like 3 hours and now i cant Wait for lauch Day, atleast i have my csgo esea Seasons to finish first.
---
I feel you. I want both! I'll settle for an unofficial RP-PvP server.
---
dont wear leather...
---
Druid can do tribute run it's just terribly slow and ineffective.

There are but posting here about it is against the tos

No his company went broke because he spent millions on a Firefall themed video game buss that ate ALL of their development fundraising

is discord not a thing anymore?
---
Okay I’ll totally remind you when I am reminded to remind you.
---
Could you give me a hint via DM?
---
Careful, any attempt at cross-faction communication beyond emotes is against the WoW EULA. There’s an addon that does this called Babelfish.
---
Yeah
---
If they are not relevant, then why add them at all?
---
Lol no they didnt. I played on several of the "fad" servers including nost at release and they were all shit shows of crashes and rollbacks. If you didn't see crashes its because you started well after the initial rush.
---
It's a bastardization of Aspergers, a form of autism. Behavior such as extremely poor social skills, an intense interest and knowledge of a very narrow subject, and being unable to connect to the real world are all common in Aspergers syndrome. I don't like that it's being used in such a way but I will concede that if anyone spergs about its definitely Asmongrel.

It's a fucking RPG, and players can play the way they want without having to feel repercussions from the community, which the community especially the subreddit has been hinting at for the past months...Guilds in Vanilla back in 04-06 were able to achieve the same results that guilds will achieve in the next year or two. You don't have to play a certain race to do that. Everyone remembers having fun and playing the game the way they did, and with the internet being a bigger resource than ever, people feel the need to take advantage of every single opinion they can find.

As a reference note, I played a 60 human frost mage on a high-end raiding guild (whatever this means anyway, all guilds in the end were able to have BWL on farm anyway) on the recent big pservers. I wasn't a Gnome, and i didn't have all BiSlots, rather had "shittier" tier 1-2 (Arc/Nether) gear and willingly knew that I wouldn't top the DPS charts. And it didn't matter, looking back. I loved the way i looked, had fun and still was able to stay consistent with the other mages despite them all being gnomes and wearing 100% BiS. The end result was the same for everyone, and everyone had fun. We beat the raid, end of story. That's the whole point. There will always be min/maxers, and they will exist in any and all guilds. The community right now before the game launches is spending way too much time focusing on these minute things, and when the game finally arrives, it'll be strictly about how much fun players have regardless if they're trying to min/max or not. They will have a place in a guild i.e. Esfand plays ret, and he does okay for a retadin. He will never heal, because he enjoys the way he plays. He even said, if you can prove that you can play your class and spec well despite what the "min/max" rule is, youll always have a place. Too much fearmongering in this sub; people making players think they will never have a place in WoW.

Them and Hinterlands are the holy trinity of zones, so many breadcrumbs back and forth and some great quests.
---
Sure it is. Why have a shitty quality voice chat at all, especially since it wasn't in classic? Everyone will be using Discord, deal with it.
---
Ok duelling specs at 30 is pretty dumb but I'll bite.    
---
Silence does not seem good. It only helps you vs half the classes and essentially every fight will come down to attrition, not 'combo/bursting' people down. VE helps in attrition vs every single match up a lot, whereas silence is completely dead vs half the matchups.  
---
Disc for mediation is really silly. You have terrible gear and won't be in spirit gear for duelling so 15% mana regen is nothing. If you really wanted a attrition/wand spec you'd go imp shield/imp renew/imp sw:p. Basically you cast your 3 instant spells and then and then wand while you regen for 20 seconds, and just repeat forever.
---
This is chill
---
Unless the streamers don’t tell anyone their servers on August 12th, which many have pledged to do.
---
More importantly, is there a list of banned words that aren't swear words?
---
For example, you couldnt make a char named Anathema when I tried. Wasn't taken, just not allowed.
---
I don't think slam spec was a thing in vanilla, i could be wrong. (the earliest i heard of it was like end of tbc or maybe early wrath.)
---
otherwise this is correct.
---
Bro, maybe people just want to play on a high pop server where they know there will be large scale world pvp because of the draw and coordination streamers can manage?
---
just so everyone knows, all alliance-&gt;horde messages work from gutterspeak (UD language) -&gt; alliance
---
I mean don't normally talk like that but, to be honest your school marming is far more unbearable. Any masculine environment is gonna have throwaway insults. Ever spend time around Marines? They say the darndest things.
---
Have any questions about legacy though? I can answer those!
---
People aren't critting for anywhere near that in retail lol. I'm willing to bet that even if you multiplied the highest non-buffed crit in the game by 1000 you wouldn't even come close to that.
---
not really my dude. he's providing criticism, not imposing his will.
---
!RemindMe 78 days
---
Are they?  I thought they were red.  Maybe I got it confused with the other mine.
---
First off all, streamers have no affiliation with Blizzard, and it’s literally free advertising, so why wouldn’t they?
---
Second, what exact was wrong with the clip?  He used the word gay?  
---
Who. The. Fuck. Cares?
---
You’re doomed to be supremely unsuccessful and miserable in life if somebody saying the word ‘gay’ causing you so much internal strife that you feel the need to post and vent about it to strangers on the internet.  Do yourself some favor and man up a bit.  Going through life as his big of a bitch boy is no way to live.
---
I hate more fun in pretty much Alpha phase firefall than I did in all of BFA and WoD lol.
---
Playing my recon and 1v300 an invasion was unbelievable fun
---
Titles, mounts, gear, enchants will mean something again. I remember grinding for my pirate hat and Bloodsail Admiral title back in the day.
---
I heard next week is a good week :P
---
I think you mean gorilla.
---
Because I'm browsing this subreddit? You also have an odd notion of being offended. I pity you, actually. You're stuck in a mindset where using retard as an insult is okay. I've never met a favorable person who does that.
---
&gt; Declining numbers says otherwise. 
---
Yeah....population decline didn't happen until the 4th expansion.  Somehow I think attributing gear resets to population decline is a bit of a stretch.
---
I was thinking of Bobby Boucher from the water boy and really struggling to understand this comment thread.
---
He should play retail if he wants updates.
---
This would be dope af.
---
How do you suppose that streamers with 30-50k viewers won't be noticed on the server they are on?
---
 https://i.skyrock.net/4124/57414124/pics/2313145763\_1.jpg
---
It's in their interest to do that, I bet it will happen.
---
The demographic of this game is not the same demographic as Fortnite players.
---
I don't pay attention to streamers at all and I'd be surprised if I were a minority.
---
2 2 - GG
---
Thanks for info. Will have to check this out.
---
Oh I have zero complaints about it at 60. It's arguably the most flexible build in the game, extremely fun, and perhaps one of the few hybrid specs outside of SW/PI priests that are raid viable.
---
But I think it's not the best leveling spec, and I'd just pick up leader of the pack and natural weapons instead, and then start getting powershifting talents like natural shapeshifter and furor. Then, respec anywhere from 58-60, if I wanted to grind out my BiS in dungeons.
---
What's happening next week?
---
    /r/wowservers
---
But great for your raid schedule, so .. ?
---
I have a boyfriend
---
Alliance for me. Easy. Why? Stormwind. Ironforge.
---
You are a fresh lvl 60 warrior tank. What do you do first? Brd runs first to get some gear going or can you go straight for Strath/scholo if you are prot spec?
---
This is a great comment.
---
oh boy cant wait to hear legolasx's prepubsecent voice saying why he needs +int cloth gear and demanding the tank go faster when the priest is oom
---
fuck no #nochanges
---
Probably not. If you haven't gotten your invite yet, then you're not likely to get one. The last F&amp;F invites went out earlier in the week.
---
So no, I won't be bumping into you!
---
But you just you don’t want anyone at your places!
---
Are the addons like questie all new versions? or is it the old 1.12 versions?
---
Should be happy you get it then. It was gone completely for 2 expansions.
---
BRUH if I released that type of information to the general public......
---
Let's just put it this way, I'm saving lives here ,ok?
---
Tanks go dual wield eventually in vanilla for a reason lol
---
^What a sensitive retard, how sad.
---
which way?
---
Hi, /u/Deathswitch
---
Stop posting this gay shit.
---
Depends what typer of learner you are. Follow F41LUR3's advice and bookmark the list of [addon API functions](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/World_of_Warcraft_API).
---
I learned by trial and failure. Opened up LUA files, read the code and only grasped the bits that used 'normal' human language. Then I started tinkering around with existing addons. Removing sections of code, changing values around etc. That lead to 
---
I'm an auditory learner so when I didn't have anyone to speak to and learn from I just looked up youtube guides, asked people in the comments and failed a bunch of times. I have no idea what advice to give you if you're a visual or kinetic learner because my process of learning stuff is akin to bashing my head against the wall sometimes lol.
---
true, i cant describe how bummed i was when BC invalidated the beautiful world of classic azeroth.
---
I'm reading now if youre horde and type a a , alliance read it as g g. But my friends and I always did 2 2, which also seemed to translate to g g
---
Clearly you've never done anything with software development if you think you can replicate randoms with hiring people to test for you
---
All of the streams I've watched reported many bugs. Stop spewing crap that is plain false.
