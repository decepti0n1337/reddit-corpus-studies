Cooler names than anything on Faerlina

Uhh where are u getting your numbers from?  There's 78 days between release and November 12th.  That's 1872 hours.  7 days of game time is 168 hours.  That means you could play less than an hour a day to get to 60 between release and the 12th.  You are the one who is bad at math.

Leveled a Paladin Alt first, used the money I saved from the free mount to funnel into my Warrior main.

Two orc bois and two thicc troll girls with some cozy fire.., we know what you guys on
---
It's strong, true. And I miss out on some more dmg, which is why I'll take that talent again when I'm done with dm:t farming. But 5% chance on an auto attack with a 3.3 ranged weapon can take a while.
---
Pointless? Maybe. But I was determined to complete the look on my rogue. I'm well aware it's not optimal and that I'm in the wrong level bracket to use it for twink gear.

Over the course of a week I did 43 boosted runs of Deadmines. VanCleef's corpses yielded: 
---
18 [Corsair's Overshirts](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=5202/corsairs-overshirt)  
---
14 [Blackened Defias Armors](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10399/blackened-defias-armor)  
---
9 [Capes of the Brotherhood](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=5193/cape-of-the-brotherhood)  
---
2 [Cruel Barbs](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=5191/cruel-barb)  
---
And a crap-ton of greens.
---
Surprisingly enough, after all those full clears the Blackened Defias Leggings never actually dropped for me and I had to buy them for the bargain price of 30 silver.
---
Snd scales with gear while eviscerate doesnt as much.
---
Classic has better balance. Hybrids got shafted in TBC. Health &amp; mana pools doubled, but their offhealing and support skills did not. Resilience totally screwed over burst damage based builds (like Elemental Shaman) too. They couldn't function in PvP.
---
Those specs didn't get fixed until WotLK - which had its own share of issues.
---
War... War without end
---
Yup, I've got 12 bag slots wasted on keys haha.
---
Same. IF music is legit
---
The little DPS you gain on bosses is not worth the 5 talent points IMO. In a raid all frost mages profit from it. I would much rather spec towards world PvP.. with phase 2 coming out soon.
---
and if you're bothering to do these quests so that you can continue on with the Fragments of the Past quest line, you only need 1 turn in for the Crystal Restore portion. Not 5 like i thought. Yes i gathered 50 yellow and 50 green crystals....... sigh
---
Hmm does it though?
---
They’re the best guild on horde... so they weren’t wrong.
---
Does this include battlegrounds or just honor for world kills? They didn't specify.
---
Private server number that after asking a fairly broad section of midcore players I've met was confirmed to be roughly accurate.
---
I feel this I work full-time as a semi truck driver and I’m a father and husband so I don’t have a whole bunch of time to play this is why I’m transferring to a lower pop server because I feel like they’re moving more at my pace
---
It looks fucking sick bro
---
I promise that in 6 months time we will still hear "majority of people arn't 60 yet"
---
Cheers this is the response I wanted to see.
---
8 hours of sm aoe grinding? Nothing to do with can't, won't is a better word. What a fucking chore that would be
---
well, i was ganked today. a warrior (60) and pala 58). 
---
as a rogue in raidspecc it's super hard to get controle over encounters like that. i was so pissed that i respecced to CB/prep. went back to blasted lands and started hunting them down in front of brd. personally i love the vicious behavior and being so angry that people make me respecc just to smack them up. but to each their own, we got pvp and pve servers to serve every mindset :)
---
Do you not know what misleading is? Or not know the definition of "solo"? Because the 4 other people in the party are the sole reason this kill was possible.
---
There’s quite a few threads about ganking and I’m sure that ph2 is going to exacerbate it a bit. However, just as much opposite faction are out in force, there will be equal or there abouts if your faction to defend/offend. 
---
I haven’t played on PvP servers much but when I have I felt that the majority of the time people just let you get on with shit. The only time I think goes against this dramatically is when your server is like 1/4
---
Favoring the opposite faction
---
What about all the people in here talking about how they're not lvl 60 yet?  Are they not casual cause they're in this subreddit?  Subscribing to a subreddit not a very good qualifier...  Also this subreddit was just completely full of leveling guides on the lead up to the release.  Not that crazy to get a couple of hints from them.
---
It’s killing me, doing BRD runs. I’m a 55 priest, I’ve been healing to princess since 52. I have very “strict” requirements to my group comp to make the 3 hour journey less shitty (yes, I know you can lava hop)
---
1 warr tank, 2 mage/warlock, 1 rando DPS 57+
---
I get usually 3 runs a day minimum, and 400 pms saying “YoUrE nOt EvEn 57 ThOuGh”
---
I just want my healing gloves off princess, I got them on my might geared warrior, and keep them to joke with other priests.
---
Thankyou genius, on my server this would be double the profit.
---
I guess we found the root cause here. 3x24 is 72, add the last 6 hours and you have 78. 3 days and 6 hours is 1 hour played per day for 78 days.
---
I'm glad you sorted that out yourself mate.
---
darn I still haven't even hit 60 and I been playing every day
---
I just think that people quoting studies = what they want to hear are obnoxious. Someone close in my life does this all the time and there are studies agreeing with any point you would try to make if you define the scope as such. I believe having kids, getting married, buying a house has made me happy so I'm definitely not arguing that one, though I think it's certainly person dependent (even if I think these things would make most people more happy / satisfied). Then there is also the question as to whether the fulfillment/ satisfaction is genuine or a result of expectations pushed on us by society.
---
I'm not discrediting all studies, and realize my previous post was obnoxiously in that direction. Just thought it was funny because a friend of mine recently told me and my wife that all of these things dont make you happy "says this study". Cool story, to each their own!
---
That's what i did =)
---
I've got my money out of overwatch and I've never bought a loot box, happy to pay for something new
---
Going for those QoL improvements huh?
---
Goodbye city raiding :(
---
Yea, I had I think two ninjas across three level 45s
---
Are these in demand for phase 2 or something? Oily black mouth were nearly worthless and now for the last week or so they're worth 2-3G a stack on Zandalar tribe?
---
your comment is rude to OP
---
Zum’rah
---
They are used A LOT in pvp. Wpvp coming out in Phase 2 will ignite a large demand for them.
---
Warlock healing is tricky because mana management is half a healer's job, and they can't be spending healing on someone who is willingly trying to lower their life to do more damage if they are already tight on mana.
---
Gotta get that blessed qiraj hammer or whatever it’s called from AQ. There’s also a feral hammer from the green dragons but idk when they come out.
---

---
Yall are seriously under utilizing EPL.
---
If you’re still in your 40s I wouldn’t worry. The average life expectancy is 71 years old so you’ve still got 30 years or so to level up.
---
Pretty comparable, remember that 7 agility is = to 7 attack power, but it’s also some Crit as well. The stamina is pretty similar so I would go agility&gt;AP when they are similar values.
---
What stupid bullshit.
---
so that is how warlock summons works, one moment you are in winterspring next second you are in MC infront of the Fire Lord.
---
Yes, I was looking at the US server list yesterday and only about 6 servers total were still layered, east and west coast combined.
---
I’m about to start farming this for my level 47 hunter! I’m going to put in some awesome black mail shoulders :D Grats on your set!
---
It means your non primary raid spec...most druids raid as restro, if you're mad go whine to blizz.
---
Name me a class that can apply a slow and kite every gcd and ill believe what you said is true. Paladins have repent for gap closing and grenades are a thing. I can say with relative certainty i know more about ret pvp in classic than you, and ill tell you you are wrong. Duels arent indicative of real pvp, and even in duel scenarios ret does well against everything that isnt a shadow priest or a lock.
---
The info I've found for the Pawn add on seems to indicate that 1 Intellect is "worth" 1.16, and 1 Spirit is "worth" 0.83 for a priest, but everything I've read about priests indicate that spirit is more valuable than intellect. Any guidance here would be appreciated.

LoH can be cast with 0 mana

I'm confused, which part of the wall is interactive? You putting a magnet on it does not make it interactive. That just makes it a wall with a magnet on it.
---
Just hit 60 on my rogue alt yesterday.........I said there would be no alts!!!!! 
---
Rip my backlog of switch games that keeps growing
---
I mained a druid, ya'll are just mad hybrids suck in classic.
---
I’m not sure if it’s just Horde but the Alli on DD are a tight knit community. It’s pretty fun knowing the other few raiding guilds, everyone knows the few server trolls. Feels like real Vanilla instead of Herod which was spellcleave neckbeards.
---
&gt;I just don't play nearly enough to get enough gold for a twink
---
Some words of encouragement: you can make a 19 twink just fine with 100-150 Gold. You aren't going to have everything BiS, but you'll have no problems staying competitive against other twinks even. Obviously you can't choose any class to do this, priests for example can be alot more expensive.
---
They just rushed it way too fast..even if she hit 60 she would be no way ready
---
ive been in several arena/angerforge runs that included fineous either because someone needed the pants or because we did the run so fast we needed to kill some time in order to prevent instance cap. incendious is right there and gives prebis fire resist gear, and in some cases prebis gear in general, and fineous is right after him.
---
As horde maybe.
---
(is human on alliance lmao)
---
My reply could also be sarcastic, maybe you missed it?
---
Level 43... I'm fukt...
---
Projecting what exactly? I don't have kids and my SO and I have decided to not have kids so we can keep our free time to ourselves.
---
Exactly, And there are still druids raiding as feral, and many raids still have a reason to bring at least one or two of them. 
---
So you still don't understand what it means if you think someone isn't a main spec feral. I ain't mad, you are severely uninformed and don't understand the concept. Instead you want to contradict yourself.
---
Nah off spec in classic is not raid vialbe...since you only have one spec at a time anyway.
---
Classic is the sole reason I took extra classes and finished my bachelor thesis. If it wasn’t for classic I’d still be slacking
---
They can still find it while exploring the city, thats how i know about it
---
12 days to get 4 levels
---
On him though. Just gotta communicate what you're doing.
---
At this rate, Phase 6 will be out next fall and then...we farm Naxx for a year or two?
---
What's with the awkward monitor angles?
---
Assuming you have HoJ it would increase your dps since the proc resets swing timer.
---
WoW just a symptom not the cause
---
REEEEEEEEEEE
---
Reason number 10,000 of why I rolled on a pve server
---
Well dmg and healing is not great for aoe so basically do you want more int or Stam?
---
You think classic raids are easier? I remember black temple being HARD AF. course I was almost always pugging or with a not very experienced guild. Only completed it maybe once. But raids like Kara, gruul, ZA I could get a pug together for them pretty easily. 
---
On that note Naxx is listed as a final phase raid for classic but that raid was one of easiest in WOTLK imo. Got undying title there back in hayday. Wondering if its about same difficulty on classic or harder
---
I didn’t say that we shouldn’t have world pvp or that everything is going to be instanced. I’m just pointing out that our experience is going to be much more extreme than it was in vanilla and I don’t think people are considering how that’s going to affect everything else.
---
We get it.
---
This sub is all gamer boomer dads who have no time to play and are still 45 who expect the world to stop and wait 3 more months for them to get 60 and expect the timeline of classic, a game where raids that used to take 8 hours over 2 to 3 days have been optimized to insane times i.e. 18 minutes (MC), 22 minutes (BWL), and leveling times where sub 10 days was absolutely insane to 3d9h and 3d12h (non-mage, solo) 1-60 to follow the same release schedule as when it first launched.
---
Hopefully the 4.0 tease will be so good you won't even want to play classic afterwards!
---
2 times have i been about to start stacking a certain thing just to have the price skyrocket while i am at work. Last time was arcane crystals and during work the p1.5 was announced and now this. RIP :P
---
Literally no one in my guild is quitting or anything like that type of behavior you are describing. What server do you play on? I’m in a very active guild
---
Why is he holding 2 dildos?
---
I did stuff in a video game.
---
You seem like a pleasant fellow.
---
I just want Warsong Gulch and Alterac Valley...
---
my 60 year old mother  who is playing  casual mode deluxe  ,clicking spells  ist  level 56.. so  i guess its not too soon :P
---
We're allowed to down vote you because of that God-awful attitude you seem to have in these two simple comments.
---
Seriously. I just replied above, but I am in one of the most active guild on Bloodsail, about 25+ were online and active when I logged off 10 minutes ago. Literally no one is acting like this. I’ve been online all day.
---
Do you know where I can find the formula to sor?
---
The ones I'm using are the [Bandit Shoulders](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10405/bandit-shoulders) but I'm sure there are some badass mail shoulders that fit the set too.
---
Note that this rotation is slightly less efficient than the previous rotation however it's much flashier and more engaging. At the end of the day l, that's what raiding as balance is all about: having fun.
---
That actually sucks for me. I work full-time and have a 1 year old/wife to keep happy. I just got level 49. FML. I might quit for a while. I just don't have the patience to be camped for Honor when I only have 1hr/ day to play lol
---
Thanks for the information! I’m going to try it out tonight! Fights like only are super closterphobic with raid frames,dog/threat meter taking up half te screen lol
---
I think that would be an excellent idea. Especially with laser printers doing exact cut outs and what not. That being said, you would need to create an outline of the object you would be cutting so I think at that point it may be easier to just do these boards digitally. There's just something about tangible objects that are just way more satisfying.
---
Will a level 40 get the same honour for killing a 40 as a 60 killing a 60?
---
lost cost fallacy.  game has nothing to do with your inability to overcome yourself
---
1)  Best spec for Priest healing PvP.  I was shadow the first time around.
---
2)  BIS PvP hear aside from High Warlord gear?  I did that grind the first time around too.  Can't do it again.
---
3) Is it worth it to keep tailoring after Truefaith vestments?
---
You're two months too late.
---
No reason why, just know that it is. Theres maybe a handful of useful BoEs in Axesmitting and armorsmitthing but only with rare recipes. If money is what you want and you havent lvld it too far your best bet is to drop it for something  more useful. Assuming you've been lvling mining with BS I suggest engineering. Otherwise another gathering profession is a good idea.
---
Because shit damage is like 60-70% of your damage and it increases it more.
---
Is it though? There's nothing forcing me to say hi in classic. The only reason I communicate with others is because they communicate with me. I suspect the only reason why ppl are more relaxed in classic is because it's mostly veterans who just care about having fun and don't really mind if a party is performing suboptimally.
---
Or they're just happy to have found a tank at all, even if I'm a bear...
---
Though I guess I'm performing better than half the warriors I've played with while dpsing or healing, so I guess that may have affected how nice they are to me.
---
Bc and Wrath were golden age to me.
---
Obviously that's the key to take down Rag
---
Every class is equally restricted. You'll never be able to experience the full game if you never make it past level 30. Just play through the content, it doesn't matter what class you choose, you will have fun regardless.
---
You must be on one of the dead servers where all the alliance transferred too because there were to many horde
---
Call a magnet sheet an interactive wall is some serious bullshit. Are you sure you don't work in sales?
---
They say no more power grinds like azurite and artifact power. I don’t believe them. I bet covenant power is going to be a thing.
---
Don't forget. TaKiNg My TiMe. "Everyone is getting epic drops and I'm just here at level 21, taking my time and enjoying the game".
---
Same dude, feels bad xD
---
Being on the RP server or anyone on a normal server are totally the opposite. We want WSG! I'm hoping it's the only battleground and released early for  a while as it was in vanilla.
---
Bruh... that’s an epic.
---
Hell yeah! The ninja costume was totally inspiration. Only thing is there’s no black bandana, only for rogues. Oh well! Cheers.
---
All my addons are updated on a daily basis trough the Twitch App.  
---
Still didn't get the loot drop chance in the tooltip until I installed the AtlasLootClassic one.
---
Haha this perfect
---
What items will jump for aq40? Nature resist items? Rings especially?
---
Hogchamp
---
At 1 hour per month gametime you’re still safe till 20. By time you hit 20 even serious players will stop caring about grinding honor and will probably play other games. It doesn’t really effect casual players at all, unless you just hit mid 40s... in which case it’s best to take a break for a while, or go hard now to have best experience.
---
Look lads, it's wun of those wee fairie folke. A rare lil' beastie they are!
---
Greater shadow protection potions and frost protection. LIPs and FAPs probably too.
---
There are no accurate h/a ratio data available for us. If you want a bunch of pvp pick one of the servers that are still layered. They will remove it as soon as phase 2 rolls out. Try to avoid streamer servers, they are mostly favoured on which ever faction the streamer plays.
---
Check Guidelime (need to install addon + guide pack separately). Easy setup instructions in their GitHub page.
---
Keyrings didn't come until like... wrath right? Or was it later than that. Can't really complain that much getting such a freebie .
---
Charstone and Cloud stone. Push INT and dont worry too much about spell power because it doesnt increase AoE dmg very much
---
I tend to have trouble finding DPS that want to do it. You'd think there would be 100000 rogues/warriors wanting their bow, but....nope.
---
Not bad looking for an undead! Chin up lad!
---
Use the walls of the buildings to LoS their casts.
---
Nah, i’ve been making a lot of gold with herb/alchemy
---
When we fight Domo, we sheep a few of the adds.  I haven't played mage but pretty sure you can only sheep humanoids right? If that's the case, should answer that question, at least for those mobs.  Considering the others are a similar model, I'd imagine they would have the same classification
---
They are, but all gems are relatively rare compared to arcane crystals (in rich veins that is). It's the demand that makes them expensive.
---
This. Take rupture off your bar in raids.
---
ITT: like 3 negative comments, and 20+ "lol so many negative comments" comments
---
Especially when I use a fucking crossbow biggest regret of wow ever
---
You should be able to hit 60 if you play everyday. Don’t underestimate the 58 to 60 grind.
---
To the giga casuals complaining about this "being too fast", world first Ragnaros in vanilla was 154 days after release, 2 weeks after Patch 1.4 (Honor) released.
---
In Classic, Ragnaros was cleared in 5 days and thousands upon thousands of guilds have had him on farm for over a month, some for all 11 weeks before Phase 2.
---
What concerns me the most is how fucked gathering professions will become without layering... I’ve always hated the idea of instanced worlds on the same server but it’s already bad enough. Came home from work 4.30 in the morning and there are at least 5-10 nerds mining thorium in every zone(horde only). I guess dm jump runs as duo will be the only way to get some crystals now
---
Can you cast it if you’re swimming?
---
Every rogue who ruptured me instead of kidney shot died.
---
exactly. reaching 60 isn't "casual". casual players never got to 60. it takes an absurd amount of time that most people with dynamic lives won't be able to spend on wow.
---
World pvp is fun when it happens naturally when 2 players of similar levels see each other in the Wild. Not when a level 50 gets spawn camped by 5 full epics coordinated 60s, decides to take a rez sickness only to meet another group of 5 full epics coordinated 60s waiting by the graveyard.
---
BWL came out 6 months after EU release. This is right on schedule.
---
if it shows incoming heals from other healers, then nah. Having *some* way to see that info ought to be mandatory, is my meaning
---
Inb4 he goes on Reddit, ‘’the minmaxers are ruining this game, good groups are impossible to get!’’.
---
I would've kept playing Dark age of Camelot.
---
The only reason I came here
---
Lol I mean I've had a few retails jobs in the past. Didn't realize there was such sticklers for precise terminology. I suppose interchangeable may have been better? Either way, You can create characters and place them/move them around to your choosing. Employees will be able to move things around to better visualize concepts. Call it what you will.
---
&gt; Back then
---
TSM
---
Free Action POtion for pvp p2p3
---
That’s an interesting way to look at it, maybe I’ll stick with it a bit longer with that in mind.  I did just get a mount so it’s not as slow anymore
---
If the person is off-tanking as feral, it is their main spec. If the person is DPSing and buffing the melee group/debuffing targets as cat as feral, it is their main spec. There's a reason you are getting massively downvoted.
---
I like real PvP. What we're going to see is closer to bullying.
---
I asked for I think it was golden pearls to buy in trade channel. Guy whispers me with a price 7 gold higher than AH. I said I am for sure not paying more than the AH price and he goes on and on about lecturing me how I am too old to get it and it's normal to sell higher then auction house
---
I’m surprised this wasn’t announced at BlizzCon.
---
The other side of that coin is that all the rare mobs are camped, all of the good grinding spots are farmed, and when world PvP hits you could wind up having a difficult leveling experience with people farming honor.
---
If you're spending the first 20 minutes running to your quest hub each and every 2hr segment, you are doing something very wrong.
---
i think i saw one for ArgentDawn-EU, but that's retail, not classic
---
Rag was downed after 5 days on classic, though
---
You can make 80-90 per hour without selling drops to players in tribute. You're right though unless he wants to farm like crazy for months just stick with mage.
---
Not sure if others have said this already, I’m kind of hoping that if they expand classic, instead of BC, they do all the unfinished stuff that was in Vanilla.
---
And heres me, lvl 48 and getting VERY worried.
---
The second highest comment on this post is a joke about getting ganked in Hillsbrad. There are clearly people willing to discuss the topic without veering off into "you should have rolled PvE" snobbery.
---
Yeah, in this case he rolled 100, so prob no issue, but generally it's good sportsmanship to always let the guy who greeded roll too. I often greed by default and then the group randomly decides the loot is valuable enough they will need. Can catch you off guard.
---
&gt;I dinged 44 today.
---
Me too! 
---
Leveling buddies??
---
LFM Ally Spellcleave Chad Mages Only
---
I gave up on those gloves and settled for the Priest T1 gloves lol.
---
No.
---
1 - I really liked 21/30 Disc/Holy
---
3 - IMO, no
---
Actually that's why I love the game. I like that there is downtime running and waiting involved. It makes the game so chill. Healing in classic is and was my favourite game experience ever. I love it.
---
“THIS MY DEN NOW B****!!!”
---
You only have one life and a finite amount of hours to do shit with that life. Money is nice but not 70 hours a week nice.
---
2 haha. I’m just cycling the rest with rested xp
---
I crit a mage for 1800 yesterday.
---
Emmm , howvabout zg and all the gear and t0.5?
---
Battlegrounds will be out in Phase 3 I believe, so you will very likely hit 60 way before then. And you can start grinding dungeons for your Pre-BiS around the same level you start giving honour to level 60 players, so doing that during prime time could save you a lot of hassle.
---
I’m a lvl 30 warrior noob who never played retail and I’m at the scarlet monastery gates but haven’t done them yet. I’ve tanked DM and Stocks, but I have no idea what to do. Should I go on the whirlwind axe quest or do the dungeons here and try to get the ravenger? Also I gotta try and grind gold for my mount at some point. I’m lost.
---
My server ALREADY is so unbalanced there is hardly any alliance at all. Hopefully blizzard will do something about that soon. Not that I have any holes given their history with that issue
---
It definitely is and you'll meet some friends or a guild at least
---
You think not having Engineering lvld will give you a major disadvantage in world PvP once phase 2 drops? You would be correct. But are you fucked? I wouldnt think so. Just gotta try harder.
---
I prefer mage with the potions, the blink is super handy underwater!
---
I'm pretty sure I'd be a better player than you.
---
Zero robe of volatile powers so far in like 6 weeks.
---
lol at people who ever thought skarm was good.  i remember tuning into one of his streams where someone ass pulled some trash in MC and he flipped out and screamed and threw his mic and then demanded the name of the guy so he could gkick him. literally every stream is just childish nerd drama about who should get loot. It’s honestly sad.
---
Yeah it does show incoming heals. Good to know I'm fine, I am using grid since forever and don't wanna switch but would have if there's actually something to gain
---
Literally every single person I have come into contact with has been super helpful and polite- opposing faction included (PVE obv). 
---
On the other hand, i wish I could find a good guild. On #3 so far. They keep disbanding.
---
I can't decide if I want to cringe or laugh at the sarcasm. Bravo.
---
Azure silk belt.
---
I can’t tell if you are joking or serious
---
It doesn’t even look like a WoW expansion, it looks like a Diablo MMO. I’ve been hyped for literally every release since TBC but I had the same reaction as you.
---
You're gross.
---
&gt;There’s nothing to do at 60. 
---
You're joking right? Only people who say this are the unprepared ones who don't have any consumables farmed up.
---
Tried guidelime with one of my alts, but it also guided me away from barrens since it expected me to be done with the zone, even tho i haven't done single quests by the level 25.
---
Idk what this does
---
What auction mod is that
---
On your server maybe. Almost everyone went tribal on mine so finding an ele lw is rare.
---
Any recommendations on spots to grind lvl 58 to 60? I’m a warlock so ideally nothing with high shadow resist, silences, and interrupts. I can grind pretty well so also need good mob density and ideally little competition.
---
So your friend hit level 60 in 4 days /played playing casually? 
---
/quityourbullshit
---
Your arguments MIGHT hold more weight if you didn’t lie and exaggerate. 
---
But since that’s the type of person you are I doubt you listen/read what others have to say so there’s no getting through to you.
---
People who play 10+ hours a day are NOT the majority. 
---
Blizzard should NOT cater to to the 1% even if they are the loudest and whiniest.
---
He's not entirely wrong Vanilla dungeons can be done with 4 dps 1 healer its really not difficult but his reaction was over the top. Next time atleast give it a shot.
---
are you playing 15 minutes a day, literally casual players ding 60 in 9 days played so they should be 60 about a month ago playing 2-3-4hrs a day
---
Fuck that, it's claasic+ or nothing for me
---
Herbs and other gathering mats should increase in price once contested areas heat up from extra fighting
---
Did anybody find the respawn Timer on Prince Nazjak? Killed him once but dont know the Timer, im on Ger(DE)-venoxis
---
Other than stating I’m working on a wall I haven’t said any details regarding project specifics. No agreements broken here lol
---
Unfortunately you're the reason why retail has become the way it is, by accommodating to the casual players who dont have the time to put that many hours in. Sorry, but that's the truth. It's a good thing that honor is coming in now and more content is being added.
---
&gt;Arms Warriors don't have enough rage to even use Mortal Strike on cooldown (Alliance side)
---
you.. have never played a warrior with good gear in a raid?
---
Classic+ ?
---
I'll rip the secrets from your flesh!
---
You guys do remember in Vanilla that high levels use to camp low level zones just to attract other level 60's? 
---
Nothing is stopping them from doing that again especially the people that dont want to join big groups to pvp...
---
idk, i wouldn't waste time farming it, mirah song off hand is good enough to do competitive damage
---
Man, you’re wasting precious globals. You want to POM right before AP ends, so the GCD doesn’t cost you a precious arcane powered frostbolt. No wonder you’re not tipping the meters, you’re doing it completely wrong. How have you ever managed to keep your raid spot? smh
---
GROBB GANG

If you aren’t getting him hes not spawning. He is a rare spawn after all.
---
Are you on wifi?
---
There are going to be a ton of people quitting soon.
---
Thought about mentioning ZG/AQ20, but some might consider them content tiers in and of themselves, albeit horizontal rather than vertical.
---
Apart from a few exceptions, dungeon set 2 gear is considered pretty bad compared to other gear you can get with less effort. It was added to give people who didn't raid a (mostly) "epic" set, but the itemizations are worse than random blues in most cases.
---
Honestly the most rediculous post I have read today. Phase 2 brings a reason to world pvp it doesnt make it manditory so the chances of players actually ganking will increase but anyone with half a brain who wanna actually go up the ranks arent going to be killing underleveled players because that gives Dishonorable kills which hinders ranking up. 
---
People who have not experienced true wpvp can't understand that not 100% of players are going to pvp 24/7 pvp server or not.
---
There are always old guilds clearing MC as well. Besides alt runs, there are items in MC that remain optional (not optimal but still solid pre-bis) till phase 6. Wild Growth Spaulders being an example.
---
If you corpse camp someone 8 levels below you you're trash
---
You're an idiot with an idiot opinion.
---
I'm level 60.  I'm just sayin no one is gonna hunt down 50's to get their honor.  There's going to be like a permanent battle at BRM to farm honor.

---
How did you make 10k gold
---
Pretty much it shows you a skill, you have to pick the correct button. It also will show just a button, you gotta click the correct spell. It grades you what spells you did well on and what you did not do well on. And next time you open the addon it will show more of the spells you didn’t guess right on. Eventually you know every keybinding very fast, great for pvp.
---
Glad to see the impact I've had on people who don't read posts let alone understand subtext
---
I don't think most of us appreciated what tripling the number of players would do. Like, I don't mind occasional PvP, but zones that I would normally expect to be dead will still have 1 or 2 people at every quest mob area. BiS phase 2 IS PvP loot, and everyone knows it this time around. All of that adds up to this nightmare scenario that everyone is worried about.
---
Personally, I think PvP will be more common, bit I already had to corpse hop into UBRS today, so I'm not sure exactly what people think will change :/
---
But that cat... lol
---
I have bad news for you if you have to be such a contrarian that you interpret my comment in the narrowest way possible in order to make a contradictory point to my statement. 
---
Nowhere did I express any opinion whatsoever that getting to a dungeon involves zero world pvp, and the assumption that you think it's not involved is insane
---
It's because it's a dead server and no demand means plenty of supply
---
Oh the 7-8 disc install really..
---
***PTSD intensifies***
---
Is there any specific reason that Blizzard isn't offering tranfers to Normal realms?
---
I joined an RP PVP realm thinking I would like it and also for a friend. Turns out I really don't enjoy it. I've checked almost everyday and I only have the option to go to other PVP realms.
---
don't, it's too early
---
Boomers are people born in the 1950s. Not a lot of 45 year old boomer dads running around wow.
---
That's what happens on PvP servers though. That's exactly what it's like, and is already kinda what has happened due to faction imbalance.
---
11 mages? We have 6. We only wanted 5 but a warrior had to quit and the 6th mage was on filler status till a spot opened up.
---
You’re locked to that specific ID
---
Lol ok. I forgot all the good gold grinding spots are totally not just inside instances
---
Pop imbalance is so bad this time around, it was way more random depending on the server during vanilla
---
i started playing a bit over a month ago and have mostly solod. im half way to 60 and its been insanely fun! there are occasions where someone invites me to a party for a quest/dungeon and that has been fun too! you can meet people through guilds and such so if playing solo gets boring you can find people whose time zones match up with yours and play with them.
---
Hey all,
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Just a quick question. I'm starting to level my alt (Orc Warlock)and was wondering  what would be the best professions for me to take.I have skinning and engineering on my main (55 hunter).
---
All my friends have I talked to have said that I should without a doubt take tailoring for the pre-raid BiS armor pieces, but I feel there may be other options.
---
For what it's worth I plan on making this Warlock my main and I would just like some good money making professions , I don't plan on going too hard PvP or PvE just yet.
---
I hate people who expect you to play everything the way they want it played.
---
Wpvp was more fun than bgs ever were
---
I'm still level 26 /shrugs
---
Most of the money to be made in phase 2 has already been gobbled up. At this point you want focus on things that will gain value for phase 3.
---
What addon gives you that nice looking stat break down to the right of your character portrait
---
Nah I'm plugged in.
---
I know spell power effects different spells differently based on their cast time with longer cast time spells getting more effect out of +spellpower then instant cast spells, my question is how does this work with spells that have their cast times reduced through talents. For example the base spell corruption has a 2 second cast time, but with 5 talent points invested you can make it instant cast, does it gain the +spellpower as if it were still a 2 second cast or does it get the +spellpower an instant cast spell would get.
---
Or “I never played wow before, but I’m starting to fall in love with this game” see random screenshot
---
On the pawn description it has this warning in red.
---
"Classic support is a work in progress, and not all Pawn features work on Classic.  Pawn does not include any stat weights by default on Classic, so you'll need to import your own."
---
So you've either imported yours from someone else or are using the wrong version..
---
Classic is a pipe dream and we understand that. It would require actual production of new content even if a ton of assets were used from TBC like caverns of time, ghostlands, etc. Even stitching things back into Azeroth would take a huge amount of effort. However, it’s the purest starting point for expanding organically while maintaining the spirit of vanilla. They could absolutely fuck it up, but I know where TBC and Wrath lead to. TBC is day one invalidating many people’s gearing (except Naxx geared players) and a myriad of small changes that dramatically turned the game into what it is today, and every expansion gets further from the shell laid out by the original devs.
---
A lot of people don’t want a continuation past classic (meaning going into next xpac) because it means heading down the same path and adding things back into the game that seemingly destroyed it.
---
If you're just starting keybinding at 60 you're gonna have a bad time, should have started at level 1
---
Work buddy got (rightfully) banned for using a fishing bit for like 10 minutes. Half year ban

No first aid?
---
so good
---
The guides will never keep you in one zone for its entirety because that is counterproductive. You will be constantly moving around the zones and returning to them when the guide considers the next batch of quests to be level appropriate. One big mistake is that players try to get the orange quests done just to get the zone completed when doing green quests in a similar zone is a lot faster and easier and gives exactly the same amount of exp.
---
Imagine regretting not playing one of the millions of video games that exist when you’re eighty lmfao. Like looking back at your life and being like “It could have been so much better if I played the vanilla reboot in 2019”
---
Eh, unless you're following a guide, it's pretty much just at
---
Advisable to clear a zone before moving on, because you want every bit of extra you can get!
---
Not sure they would agree
---
Yeah, I suddenly feel like I picked the incorrect server.
---
Honestly every prot warrior I've played with while leveling has sucked at tanking. I don't know enough about the class but Fury just holds aggro better, does good damage, and most importantly -- can hold aggro on multiple mob.s
---
So for a example going from level 10–20 alliance, I will start in loch Modan, do the easy quests and finish around level 13, then head to Darkshore do the easy quests till about 15 then head to Westfall till about 17-18 then return to either lochmodan and do elite/15+ quests or darkshore and do the bottom half of it until level 20.
---
I can’t because the quests are too hard in the zones I’m in
---
1 level per day baby
---
Even if you don’t hit that the last few days to 60 / first few days of p2 will be rough
---
Just go to a quiet zone like silithus or deadwind pass to grind mobs hopefully away from the pvp
---
Or do dungeons
---
Lots of traveling but questing at your level is good rather then struggling finishing a zone with those orange/red quests.
---
Obviously, if you're enjoying classic keep playing.
---
If you've just been solo questing up to this point, then I'd say expect to end up in more skirmishes with other levelers. They will now have an incentive to actually attack you. You also will have an incentive to attack them, so feel free to get aggressive! And if you can group up with other players your level for questing, power in numbers, etc.
---
I also expect an uptick in the number of players running dungeons as they level from 48-60, so if you ever feel like things just aren't being fair to you, I'd recommend spending some time in dungeons too. Those higher level dungeons have some pretty bomb gear, and good experience.
---
This is why the wife and I went pve server. Which IMO is also boring, but at least shes playing and not hating the game.
---
Shit, you leveled first aid all that way for that?
---
Me and some friends got tired of these massive guilds that just recruit anyone and wanted to start our own guild, a small one but with the people we play with almost everyday. At this point we're only 8, and we need 10 people to sign the chart. Question is: do peolpe that sign the chart get added to the guild as you create it? Can you remove them later and have a guild with less than 10 members?
---
Lots of classes have vastly different spell sets depending on spec. And a lot of people change specs at later levels as their preferred spec isn't optimal for early leveling. And lots of spells that are great for PVP aren't optimal for raid dps, and vice versa. So if someone is wanting to get into PVP to be ready for phase 2, an add-on like this may be very useful to practice.
---
That is true, but the case was that character had done 0 quests by the level 25 so there was no reasons to move zones. thats why I was looking for addon that reads characters database of completed quests and level, rather than one that expects certain quests to be done.
---
it was overhyped outrage and they keep to themselves.  they are no more or less toxic than any other average guild.
---
Not once you get out of the starting zones, no. You might be able to do the majority of quests if you're careful or group up towards the end but I wouldn't expect to finish them all on the first pass.
---
I am on Sulfuras and it's extremely even H/A, for what it's worth.
---
I remember Ion said before that phase 1 would be the shortest phase and this lines up with that. It should be the shortest by all rights, there’s relatively little to do besides farm and raid. Honour will make a big difference while people will still have time to gear up from MC well before BWL.
---
dont trust any response here, these ppl are refering to private bullshit that has almost zero relevance to classic economy, like that guy below me, the mats will get farmed and the price will go down significantly, also lot of ppl wont just care about consumables at all and its debatable how many pure pvp people will be in the game
---
Well I giggled and was gonna make a joke about the belt giving 420 herbalism but I guess we’re just putting sticks up our butts nowadays.
---
This is amazing. Wow.
---
Blissárde
---
Had a horrible tank afk twice today. Claimed he had to shit really bad. No word either time. One was near 10 minutes right in the middle of the dungeon. Only reason he wasn't kicked is because we were spamming LFG but couldnt find another tank. Rough.
---
Unless you start a zone halfway between the suggested level range, you won't be able to clear the whole thing in one go. Especially places like Stranglethorn Vale which is like 30-50. Unless you feel like spending hours grinding levels, there simply aren't enough quests just in STV to fill that range.
---
Sounds like my job for a construction material manufacturer
---
Apparently, you didn't understand it. Community is great, but there's nothing wrong with kicking someone who is AFK when everyone is waiting. And there's also nothing wrong with minmaxing or searching for your prebis. Minmaxing is fun, and people aren't having fun wrong by doing so.
---
I really don't understand what you're trying to say here. I get that you like the community aspects of the game more than minmaxing, but buddy, if you are afk while everyone else is waiting you deserve a kick. And if you go to reddit afterwards to bitch then  you deserve to be made fun of.
---
That's when you hit em with the /spit and run off before he can reply like a real man
---
Blizzard will rush out battlegrounds like they did dm don't worry.
---
I mean I see the use of this but its also like something that would be entirely unecceaary if you swt up binds yourself andnjust farmed for an hour
---
5 weeks to level 60 averages 2 hours and 45 minutes every single day.
---
Take a day off a week and you're talking 3 hours a day, 6 days a week.
---
That ain't casual, my dude. That's a rush. That's not take-work-off and stay-up-til-3am "rush", but it sure as shit is a rush
---
That's actually T6.
---
Creating my character tomorrow, lol. I’ll make sure to roll a stealth class! Glhf all :)
---
If you can even get to the entrance.
---
There's your problem.  You're not wearing plate.
---
yeah, second raid team
---
The reason I had to quit playing for 3-4 weeks is because I had to move unexpectedly. So, literally having a life that interferes with me from playing this game on a regular basis.  Go fuck yourself.
---
&gt; There’s nothing to do at 60.
---
You are insane. There's a million things to do and I say this as someone with near full epics and 20+ days played. I still need to level alts, to grind profesions, get consumes for phases, farm mats, get twink items, etc.
---
Should be lots of fun wym?
---
Why wouldn't PvP be taken into consideration? This isnt retail. Surely nobody is playing classic just to do easy raids! If you can give one drop to a rogue that satisfies all of their weapon requirements surely thats better than feeding multiple drops to a warrior to achieve the same?
---
Fury warriors dont care what type the weapon is, only about dps and AP. They do get certain gear all to themselves, nobody else is going to be rolling on any of the 2h's or axes besides memespecs of which there are maybe 2 in the whole raid.
---
With my gear and his lack of a taunt id either tank it myself because he can’t hold aggro or I’d stand there doing nothing because he has no way to pull threat off me.
---
If it was a little bit, or if it wasn't looking to get exponentially worse very soon, you'd be right. But it's not "a little bit" if you only play for 2 hours on a good day and have to spend 30 minutes of that ghost running and being corpse camped. To somebody who's logging 20 hours or more a week, that amount of time isn't that significant. When 8-10 hours was a busy week for you, it is. 
---
This is why people, especially those that don't have a history of gaming, should start playing WoW on a PvE server and move over to a PvP server once they have the fundamentals down. 
---
I can't even imagine trying to play on a PvP server in two weeks if I'm struggling to learn how to kite a mob as a mage.
---
how can I get it?
---
God forbid people post about stuff they did in a video game on the video game Reddit
---
Darn then you should probably find a guide
---
Necrosis
---
Nah man, you’ve looked like a fool throughout this entire thread.
---
Literally everyone thought you were talking about people not playing with the shaman as if they should try. Your wording was ambiguous to a point that I didn’t know you were on op’s side till a few comments in.
---
Have your friends make alts and have them sign. I doubt it only allows 1 sign per account.
---
The talents do not affect the spellpower. Pretend you didn't use that talent.
---
Also for dots, they are not based on cast time. Dots just get the whole amount over the entire time. So if you 30 spell power, that's 30 extra damage over the entirety of the dot.
---
Arms has the best AoE threat.
---
Take it with a grain of salt.
---
I leveled disc from the start. With the first 5 points in shadow mana talent. At 40 I respecced to full disc to grab power infusion. Added the 5 back in to mana talent from 41-45. In dungeons it generally doesn’t proc.
---
I’ve had a lot of fun with it. I tend to run dungeons pretty often and there is almost always a spellcaster who enjoys the buff to dps (as many people point out with the shadow spec healing comments, you will almost never need it yourself). Spellcleave runs are even more fun. 
---
You get increased power fort and a spirit buff. Also get a clutch mana-free increased crit chance spell (saves me constantly)
---
Definitely not the most proficient but I find it super fun and haven’t wished to be shadow at all.
---
Can't wait for world boss action on stalaag. Crystal crown here I come
---
The fact that you think your life is a choice between those two things (where there are many other options) is kinda the issue..... 
---
If you don't like option A or B, invent option 3.
---
ye blissarde
---
It can be a competitive spot but farming the winterfall furbolgs in winterspring not only provide rep, but they drop winterfall firewater, which is not only just fun to use yourself, but sells for a decent amount.
---
I've done the math on the T1 set bonuses, they don't make up for the HP lost to get them.
---
But doesn't this prove my point? Chain heal is far from favouring MP/5 when it has literally the strongest hp coefficient in the game.
---
Lol
---
It's not better though, until it procs, then it is far better. That's the problem with IF as a TPS weapon, it's not going to be reliable. On a raid boss, you need instant threat, so I would take the extra weapon damage and stats on Core Hound Tooth.
---
Well back on gehennas prices already dropped to normal again, so it's maybe not that crazy.
---
[deleted]
---
The whirlwind axe is incredible and the earlier you can get it the better. I only saw the ravager drop once and I lost the roll. I ran SM arms a stupid amount and finally gave up.
---
I see Blizzard is recycling content on that new Shadowlands expansion. It's just Classic WoW with warrior as the only playable class, and no group content.
---
If you ignore the context of the post, sure, if you understand someone shouldn't be harassed for leaving a group based on preference, no.
---
So did you end up getting the tailoring pattern you were looking for?
---
My guild and I have been 5 dps'ing several instances for them to go faster, even 3 manned a few like strat living.
---
Oh no i dinged 48 yesterday
---
I had the same problem. Head to Darkshore. It'll bridge you nicely.
---
ironically pserver records are like 9 days for pug and 10 days for guild run LOL
---
Dungeon farming too fucking OP
---
Cleave runs depends strictly on how much time you waste looking for groups and I guess how bad the groups are.
---
It's by far the most efficient leveling method besides aoe grinding with zero competition(as if that's possible), but that's if you are in a dedicated group. For pugging I honestly wouldn't recommend spamming dungeons unless if you are in an ideal case of long hours with good exp per hour.
---
I mean obviously the buffs were necessary, but his stats were closer to a lvl 25 with all those buffs. Those aren't your normal players buffs
---
That’s strange, as an enh shaman I’m right with melee the entire fight and never get targeted with either ability. As long as all melee duck out waiting for Wrath of Ragnaros to hit the off tank, we have no mechanic issues.
---
I'm not so sure about first week of Jan.
---
I'm betting 8.3 for retail comes some time around mid Decemeber, with the raid probably launching early Jan.  I'd give it a month or so after that for p3, personally.  That'll feel about right.
---
Custom calendar, or chore (IE background) list would be awesome
---
I haven't watched PvP videos since Cata so take my opinion with a grain of salt, but this feels like a 13 minute video that would've been better if it was a 5 or 6 minute video. A lot of those fights played out exactly the same, kind of felt gratuitous including so many highlight reels of  either the same exact pounce or roots opener. The editing choices really confused me as well, over-editing when you walk into a hunter trap, press bash, land a grenade, and seemingly every moonfire crit causing a mini seizure. Cool to see Balance Druids still, though.
---
*ahem*

LOOK LADS, IT'S WUN OF THOSE WEE FAIRIE FOLKE. A RARE LIL' BEASTIE THEY ARE.

Killing grey level players does NOT give DH kills, the only things that give DH is civilian npcs.
---
There's fun to be had playing the AH.
---
Is layered really that bad on Fairbanks? I have a friend playing there but I don't want to have layering ruining my experience
---
I’m pretty sure blizz wants to sell expansions so either want people off classic faster or will sell you tbc again.
---
grats this is the dumbest thing I've read today

I'm a no changes kinda guy but this something we can all get behind.

Ok, so what exactly do you cunts want on this subreddit then?  You are crossing a lot of possible uses of a WoW forum off the list in one brief comment section.
---
I'd love to get a cool screencap like this, but I almost always get murdered as soon as she lands.
---
Found a dude who tried to do this with me 2 days ago. Luckily i use TSM so i saw it right away. I bought 3 new Pearls and sent them back as a return mail with the same medicine :3 havent been on for a day yet, so dont know if it worked
---
I haven't watched PvP videos since Cata so take my opinion with a grain of salt, but this feels like a 13 minute video that would've been better if it was a 6 or 7 minute video. A lot of those fights played out exactly the same, kind of felt gratuitous including so many highlight reels of either the same exact pounce or roots opener. The editing choices really confused me as well, over-editing when you walk into a hunter trap, press bash, land a grenade, and seemingly every single moonfire crit making the screen shake just felt like too much for too little. Cool to see Balance Druids still, though.
---
Weird flex but cool.
---
They literally tweeted like 2 weeks ago that it would be "late 2019" ... 2 weeks layter they say November 11... They should have said "soon" 2 weeks is not late 2019
---
Lucky I had the mats to 1-300 engi sitting on a bank alt. Phew.
---
So then the entire game should be catered to you because you had to move?
---
ROFL

Way to morally grandstand, Congressman.
---
And to be fair, Anaheim needs Blizzard more than Blizzard needs Anaheim. Not that they would or should take the fall for those shits.

dickhead lol

Although, gnomish engs can still use bombs. They just can't create them.
---
Are you aware that most of the storyline from warcraft is based entirely on "racism?"
---
necro here: do you know what it dropped from? there still is not one on our server, mankrik, and there have been some heated discussions about what people should farm to try to get one on the server.
---
Rank 3 gives 10% discount on everything. Mount, inkeeper food etc etc.

Honor dosn't only benefit 60s. STV will be a bloodbath.
---
I'm 55 and my sub ran out 8 days ago. I need a few bucks more and I'll get 3 months. Fuck. I'm gonna get camped a lot.
---
You have to follow the imp which some could be considered to be a quest either way its not going to be done without a group.
---
I’m about to do the same.
---
Are you aware that a game is different from real life where real people are hurt?
---
absolutely you should be dominating mages. 
---
The key is fake casting fear until it baits a cs on him. You can do this in the opener or wait til a crucial part of the fight where he is sweating a bit more under pressure. 
---
ideally the mage has 2 ice blocks so the key is to not put yourself oom by the time he blocks the 2nd time. 
---
That being said if the mage is good he will be on top of dispelling any curse you put on him. So really make sure you put up corruption and siphon life first and then agony/tongues when he is less likely to notice his debuffs. Once you get SL/corruption on him then proceed to either 1) fake cast fear until cs; OR 2) immediately death coil + amp curse then fear THEN apply agony so it will tic for 5-10 seconds before mage has opportunity to decurse.
---
Essentially once you get one of your fears on him it’s gg (so long as you keep reapplying fear for so long it takes), but then they will iceblock. Here is a crucial part of the fight, what I do is I keep fake casting fear until they are out of block then time the last cast with the end of block. If the mage is good he will get out of block early to cs your fear. This is good. In the unlikely scenario where this happens you proceed to the felhunter cs his first frost bolt (this is why you save it for a defensive interrupt). and then healthstone whatever hp you lost up to this point and then keep applying fears til u win. 
---
Pets that are viable: all besides imp in this situation. I prefer FH or Succ. VW is fine too just don’t sac too early. 
---
Also another helpful tip is to always have a healthstone on deck and a soul stone on you AT ALL TIMES. You would be surprised how many scenarios this has helped me with. 
---
TL;DR - Use fear, death coil, healthstone when possible and it should be gg.
---
I mean there is a reason we don't play retail those interactions matter.
---
Lol I'm only 42 aswell, I'll prolly be in the 45 to 60 nono zone when phase 2 releases. Things are going to get exciting quick lol.
---
I feel the same way. I was able to get at least a couple of crystals in my hour farming sessions 2 weeks ago but now I don’t get any... blue sapphires almost feel worse to me too.
---
It's been pretty lively around here. It's no Faerlina, but then again few servers are.

It's more of a server lore thing. Some guilds are more serious about defending towns/zones they're associated with but it doesn't impact the game in any way. 
---
A lot of guilds on this list are really small. A lot of guilds aren't even on the list.
---
How do you use the Felhunter tho? To dispell poly?
---
Wailing Caverns
---
But how am I supposed to get WW by myself?
---
A heroine is a female hero. Heroin is the drug.
---
I just wanna grill for God’s sake
---
well not really a bunch of people bitched about the mods removing posts they deemed low effort.
---
well now you get all the low effort posts you want.
---
How the hell do you press cntl-F2 for water form?? You must have massive hands
---
This is too soon for me as a week 1 lvl60 but will adapt accordingly. Feels like a response for the failing twitch viewership. Understandably no one wants to watch 10 hours of jump runs, but that's what classic should be about the farm, the grind and so on.
---
We had our rogue guildie (who levelled way faster than we did) run us through instances. He wasn't high enough that the stuff was trivial. It was kinda like healing an appropriately levelled tank.
---
It’s not about the in-game justification of why she was able to do it
---
It’s the shitty writing that put her in that position. Yes she’s empowered by a death god, but *why did the writers choose to have her empowered by a death god*
---
It’s shitty writing. Walking up to Lich King jr and soloing him in front of his army is shitty writing.
---
There’s a +20 rod and I’m pretty sure there’s a horde only rod as well. I don’t know the stats.
---
Seriously, I thought it was pretty obviously lol. I hope you enjoyed the laugh as much as I did.
---
Not sure if /s or not.. but that's the same account... Not two diff ones..
---
Full 8-piece constitutes a loss of ~250 +healing over equivalent gear from that level. It provides +8.75% efficiency and +24% throughput to your Healing Wave.
---
At the level of gearing we're talking about, that's the difference between +350 healing and +600 healing.
---
On max rank Healing Wave, there's no question Earthfury is better than the alternatives by an enormous margin. Remember, the Earthfury bonuses are multiplicative with the entirety of your heal rather than just an additive bonus.
---
On HW5, you lose a small bit of throughput but have better overall efficiency.
---
The sheer volume of stats on Earthfury compared to the alternatives also leans towards its value. While Intellect, Stamina, Spirit, Critical and mp5 may not be very good stats, you get them 'for free' on top of comparable/better performance.
---
... they were corrupted and led through the Dark Portal by Kil'Jaeden? Humans are land owners. Orcs are proletarians!
---
Join a guild and ask a higher level guildie to carry you through the hard parts. Or offer to pay someone to help.
---
What a gaping dipshit.
---
I think it was final boss
---
They die just as easily as the rest of the hordeys though
---
Roger. Thank you!
---
Hamstring costs the same amount of rage but does damage and can crit causing deep wounds
---
20+ rod, enchants, feel like I’m missing one.
---
You can ya g around the elementals in Arathi and hope someone farming them gives you the charms, or you can buy them, buy the life root, and the tusks are a pain. You’ll need help but there always people questing. Took me three days to get the tusks. But I got the axe at 32 and I used it until 50.
---
Exactly, maybe someone even gets camped so much they turn to alcoholism irl. Who knows!
---
I'm horde on Rattlegore and doing the same thing. Hmu.. Sadwich is my Rattlegore char.
---
Level 31 Warrior, got my WW Axe at 30 due to not giving up and refusing to level without it because I was using a level 15 Green Axe that did minuscule damage compared to WW. I got WW, decided to fuck around and my lord it was insane what I could do to mobs in 1k Needles. I was actually capable of killing things without needing to sit down and heal every couple of pulls.
---
Inorite?  I looked at that sequence and was like, "do u even mage?"
---
That's not how quests were distributed in Classic.  Almost every zone will have a quest or two that is well out of the level range.  For instance, the dwarf explorer guy in the hills in the south of Westfall gives a quest chain that is level 42.  There's a level 25 quest in Feralas.  Badlands has a bunch of late 30s quests, and then 2 level 50 quests.
---
If you don't start travelling in your teens or early 20s, you're missing a lot of quests you could do for XP.
---
Reminds me of the time I smoked cigarettes for 3 months in senior year of high school to prove to friend they’re not addicting. I don’t smoke cigarettes to this day. But everyone’s different. Internet addiction is real
---
Yeah that sounds like a good idea :)
---
Ive heard people say that about mages!
---
Just leveled my second healer to 60. Never played warrior before but I know for a fact it’s a night and day difference from fury to prot. Going to be a shitty run when you can’t over pull/fuck up once or end up wiping...
---
I mean on the 12th layering will be gone anyway so I wouldn’t worry about it.
---
Remember, Blizzard has collective ass cancer for ever coming up with an idea as bad as layering.
---
Wait, why is everything so overfarmed??
---
I get where this can be useful. A lot of keybinds are situational and you barely ever use them then get in to an "oh shit" situation and you don't have the muscle memory for that key/s since you never use them and the you are searching for it.
---
The same thing happens every time they announce content releases. We saw it with essence of water, pristine black diamonds, and cured rugged hides when DM was announced. The prices of pvp consumables have already jumped.
---
If you’re investing with the crowd you’re late to the game.
---
I get called a retailer because I'm going crazy about pre BIS and BIS but it's so much fun to me. I'm 1 piece away from having everything I wanted and it's all so exciting. I sucked absolute ass back in the day, I don't understand what's wrong with wanting to be great. 
---
You'd think the people that hate minmaxing wouldn't mind losing gear to a minmaxer but they go absolutely nuts over it like THEY derserve the loot. Aren't they trying to make their characters better too?
---
final boss was hyped up to be the worst thing ever prior to the game launching but they are very tame.  they have been mostly pleasant and kurthos does a good job of kicking out the shitters.
---
Yea, you’ve got to switch zones constantly while leveling up. Check out some guides to see what items will help you out.
---
Can you give me an example of what items will help me
---
&gt; and move over to a PvP server once they have the fundamentals down. 
---
This part I disagree with. Played vanilla on a pvp server, and at some point came to the realization that i don't really like world pvp. Rolled pve in classic and it's been super chill, waving at rogues and mooing at cows.
---
I think it’s mainly so people don’t grind out the gear on normals then swap to pvp where they would be ahead of the curve. 
---
I assume you can’t transfer the other way around to keep it consistent. Also I don’t think the pvp is that bad. Most people would let you farm as long as you don’t bother them. You can obviously expect more pvp on Friday and weekend nights.
---
No , you were boycotting blizzard because some guy in the internet told you to
---
I wish I was a bored 60. * cries in father of 2 *
---
I quit WoW to focus on my career. It's freaky being bored again. Like, what do I do with myself when I have chunks of free time? The silence is maddening.
---
Everyone wants to be TOP DPS
---
She faces barely any challenge and with how quickly and easily she dispatches any opponent we might as well have just sent her to 1v1 N'zoth.
---
So only people that hate retail are welcome in classic?
---
Those people are there because they are bored and out of incentives, honor is a constant incentive, and requires lvl 48+, although they may switch to twinks.
---
This right here
---
I'm normally not cynical, but D3 was also supposed to have PvP
---
They already quit or at still in their 30's and honestly we don't care about their opinion. Because they will be just as casual later as they are now. The majority of the people who will be resubbing for classic wow are already 60 and bored out of their minds with MC/Ony.
---
They rushed phase 2.....
---
Dude you’ve spent over half the past 2 months in front of a screen?
---
Maybe South Park wasn’t that far off...
---
D:
---
Surprised not to see The Enclave on here. Horrigan put up a PvP video just the other day on Grobulus. Did they not come back to Vanilla or have they just not grabbed a spot?
---
That's actually pretty cool
---
This.
---
Asking for a friend

---
The skinny legs and arms thing got me
---
Maybe interlaced with a little /e for extra immersion.
---
&gt; Dense Sharpening Stones on Garr and Rag
---
But this won't stack with Windfury.
---
That has the ui of an addon called elkanos buff watcher or buffalo
---
i mean if he had to shit then he had to shit. 
---
I understand not enjoying having stand around doing nothing but sometimes it is how it is.
---
Even the most avid pvpers probably want to chill and actually get some exp on their alt at some point.
---
If you are planning on getting off a pom frost bolt, it shouldnt matter if you use it right away or right before the arcane power ends. Its gonna be the same amount of global cooldown wasted either way. Not to mention using it earlier starts your pom cooldown earlier. Am I missing something?
---
I don't bother.
---
Not like anyone will notice if I die on Shazz.
---
The Stallag server just has everything marked as Horde outside of IF, SW and Darn.
---
If you aren't 60 by now, you clearly are too casual for world pvp to be a big goal of yours. Coming on almost 3 months by the time it drops, and all you had to do was hit 60 on one character.
---
Playing 3 hours on weeknights isn't rushing. Maybe for people with families,but if you are single, it's not unmanageable. I'm sure even married people watch 3+ hours of TV a day.
---
Reaction time!
---
He's the type of player keeping the game financially alive.
---
Vanilla servers weren't this populated, and the game is a ton older so now people actually know how to farm honor and know what it leads to. Comparing Classic to Vanilla as far as meta is just ignorant at this point.
---
i dont have any of those lol
---
Already ??? Wtf
---
got 6 days played level 45
---
Fuck guys I’m a level 23 priest
---
I have experienced it the other way around. On PvE people seems to stay more to them selfs less social interactions. I would say most new players start out on pve so they don’t really know how important team work is. 
---
While on pvp I could always find a friendly player to help me out. It comes with the occasional ganking and corpse camping. But in my time leveling I have been corpse camped twice. Ganked quiet often but that’s because I gank others as well. But that usually ends with one of us dying then the other goes and do his quests somewhere else. People don’t usually hold grudges. 
---
Also a big plus in pvp are world raids, you can literally go into a big city yell that you planning a world raid and you can easily find 20-40 people to join you. 
---
Me and 4 of my friends did that last weekend and we got together 55 people.
---
If you tank good in dungeons you’ll make a lot of friends. Everyone wants a dependable tank on their friend list
---
Phase 2 came out too soon.
---
The top 10% still have TONS to do. Even apes main raiders are still missing tons of stuff. We wanted full PvP BiS for p1 and a lot of us are missing a ton. I have gotten at least 1 item every MC lockout since launch and I'm still missing a TON of p1 BiS. I would consider myself lucky.
---
Holy shit this sub is savage. Why are you being downvoted so hard???
---
I hate that I'm being forced to hit 60 asap. Like, I want to sit back and relax, level some alts every once in a while, and just experience the game. I get that people want to raid in the guild, but barely any of our memebers are 60. It sucks, you know?
---
It ignores armor, so its damage is higher than it looks.
---
Wowhead Prot pally guide has it listed; including the extra chance on hit Proc rates
---
/r/cursed
---
What's phase 5? Gruul? Or is that even classic. I cant keep up.
---
do you have weak auras or aura something?
---
church
---
something something idle hands, my point was that having a constant thing to do will draw many of the nolifers away from deadmines etc, as they will be competing for RP in p2.
---
Sitting on about 320 potions myself right now, that's all I could afford
---
 You Can hide in dungeons lol. I'm Also a 36 on my main I'll either hide in SM or be out having fun myself. If SM is impossible to get to, you can find spots to gribd mobs
---
Grobb is going to be lit.
---
It looks like dbm, ive seen dbm list the count down on your buffs before. I dont know the exact command but try messing with that
---
Honestly no clue. Was it an Ally guild? Im horde and havent experienced any toxic guilds
---
Where I live there is no daylight savings, but where the server host is there are. So yeah ever since the swap I’m an hour behind.
---
Sounds like you are subtly trying to tell the op off for trying to get an item that will let him skip half the dungeon.
---
The downvotes make me smile, so many salty nerds. Goml.
---
I pray your on the Benediction server
---
It's definitely that.
---
*laughs in pve server*
---
Social interaction exists in retail? Could have fooled me
---
lmao
---
Got em
---
Should be banned for this
---
Yeah there's a ton of misinformation out there that "there is no point going deep prot". Which is fucking insane to hear. I'm deep prot, and I'm in half prebis and half bis and I'm finally considering making the switch to furyprot, but I will likely wait until I absolutely have to. Furyprot takes on average 40 percent more damage, and in a 5 man that means you're hitting the fucking dirt. A lot.
---
If you're a fresh 60 and tanking full time you are an idiot not to go deep prot. Your mitigation will be better AND your threat will be better.
---
you said it bb
---
Wait thats illegal
---
Lmao apparently you're not. Show me on this doll where this human warrior hurt you.
---
Yeah but being that I’m now level 52 I think I’d rather have them in Moonbrook than ganking me lol
---
I like that I can take a week off in classic. Try and take a week off in retail and you're suddenly waaaaay behind. Whenever any of my friends tell me they're starting to get burned out, I just tell them to take a week off. Not worrying about clocking in like it's a job is so nice.
---
Mining engineering here, only because I like to pvp.
---
so no bg's yet?.. oh boy this is going to be a shit show

I posted this fully expecting it to get downvoted, this still entertains me

You don't need to step outside to reset it though.

Why would you whisper someone when they're already on ignore

Spending 20% of your waking moments in life on a video game doesn't sound like rushing?

I've definitely hit those levels of play time on video games, but lets not pretend that sustaining that for months is normal for most people with balanced lives
---
All key+key moves are as far apart as possible.  F1+0 on the keypad. Left control + print screen.  Makes me look like a cokehead hacker.  Friends that walk by the rig when I’m raiding get flung into walls by the devastating forces moving about the desk.  Panties have been known to explode, melt, or both in that order.

---
seems this is only a few weeks different than the time between 1.1 to 1.4 in vanilla
---
elemental earth maybe. on my server they're around 1.5-2g and if I'm not mistaken, once AQ patch gets closer those should spike up at least double. I don't do much of this stuff tho so don't take my word for it, I just know they seem a lot cheaper than I recall them being and I remember on pservers there being a frenzy for them. 
---
Also one thing I saw people do is buy up a bunch of enchanting mats right before a big patch, and then start selling on the first reset night.
---
As this guy said, never had an issue telling people I don’t know the layout. Usually there is another guy who goes “me neither”.
---
Hey can you repeat the sentence "Nazis are bad."
---
Is alchemy going to be going money making?  Especially with phase 2 announced?
---
Thank you btw for your answer I appreciate it.
---
&gt; people who are done with P1 are quite content with the release timing.
---
of course they are and of course it's a fraction of the population just like on live.
---
that’s way slower than the original vanilla patch cycle even
---
Tried getting into BRD lately?
---
He's talking about 18min MC and 22min BWL I believe.
---
I'm hoping for horizontal progression in a classic+. New dungeons, gear, 40 man raids, 20 man raids, and even 10 man raids with fancy and harder mechanics. But nothing handed to you and nothing gives you better gear than Naxx. Hopefully everything should be a little harder than its classic counterpart for for the same quality of gear. That way there's no stat inflation and the work you did is never invalidated and worthless. Plus it makes having alts seem more fruitful for once your main is geared out. They can always have you need to "progress" in gear by making a new resistance "mandatory" for their new raid.
---
He’s probably using a Logitech mouse and that’s just a random macro he’s made for one of his mouse buttons that will never conflict with anything. I do the same thing.
---
Yes
---
yeah not even a brb or afk or anything. Just right after a fight ended wasnt there anymore.
---
You just invite somebody give him leader, all logs out, he reset while you are logged out and when you enter the server again you will be at start of instance.
---
Meh, that's 2 days before AoE2 DE releases, that kinda sucks. I wanted to go for R13, but on the other side I also want to play AoE2 with my brother &lt;.&lt;
---
Slowly turning into anime waifu
---
Take a shot everytime you are ganked
---
Yeah fair, I guess it was just my inner pedant breaking out.
---
You probably can’t solo hogger at level 11
---
Go look up the turn ins required for AQ gates. Stockpiles those. 
---
Elemental Earth for nature protection potions. 
---
Elemental water for ice protection potions for Naxx. 
---
Grave moss for shadow potions. 
---
Plaguebloom. 
---
Go to the AH and buy cheap then bank it.
---
There are alot more poop-socky players playing classic than vanilla, this will be way more brutal before battlegrounds.
---
🌊🌊🏊‍♂️🌊🌊
---
Is that a “want TO grill” or “want A grill?” I live in an apartment and have no space for one. I just got an ice cream maker, though!
---
We have a freeze warning tonight. Dammit.
---
Personally the tailor/enchanting combo feels pretty good on a mage. With a warlock you have a pet tank so I feel like your armor matters slightly less. Also I feel like warlock can benefit from slightly more esoteric pairings, like caster gear that has stamina because of life tap. Of course frost and shadow gear from tailoring have a point for both, but I think mages may still edge out on tailoring utility.
---
you leveled, you need more stats to equal their old worth. carry on son
---
You can't wait for everyone. You want to wait with BWL until everyone and his mom is decked out in epics?  
---
The hardcore players are meant to be ahead, this is not retail WoW. He who invests more time deserves to be ahead.
---
Live to Win
---
It was a joke. Relax
---
They didn't say it would be successful. They said they didn't want it.
---
I might recommend northeast epl. Just all of the mobs in that area. You won’t have any competition, can check out lakes to see if water elementals are free, and the yellow maggots drop larval acid which sells for okay.
---
So you spent like 20 sapper charges on a ball of unflagged players?
---
Wow died on WoTLK 👏👏👏👏
---
Yeah but that defeats the whole purpose I want to do it when it's current and difficult.
---
It’s frustrating for people to be only rolling in 1 set of gear while other are rolling on multiple sets, especially if queues are rough for them. But what can you do🤷‍♂️
---
I’ve been loving Classic but the this comment is too real. Well put, haha
---
Well first off it's subjective, so just because it feels too fast for the two of us above, doesn't mean we actively want to to be slow for other players like yourself. Dire Maul already changed how people group from what I've heard, so it will have an effect on us "casuals" even if minor.
---
&gt; they are squashing the level cap to 60
---
I mean, something like this had to happen eventually.
---
It seem like they're making a framework for every future expansion. 1-10 is an introductory experience to wow with its own practice dungeon. 10-50 you can level in any expansion you choose. 50-60 is Shadowlands.
---
I imagine that when the expansion after Shadowlands releases, Shadowlands will become one of the expansions you can choose to level in from 10-50.
---
Well that shattered the illusion... If I sucked, then most others sucked more, Wich means by comparison I didn't suck. Right?
---
You guys are worried about getting to lvl 60. I'm a full bis warrior and I'll die to any warlock/mage/rogue that gets the jump on me. Warrior life feels bad man.
---
Duno about bis, but the necropile gear from scholo is farmable and has decent stam/ int.
---
Flightmasters, Chillwind, but yes, also BRM. Camp Onyxia Entrance on Weekend days and Tuesdays.
---
This fish is so easy to get just by fishing anywhere
---
I think there are a few levels that change things up a bit, difficulty wise. Ive noticed every 10 or so levels things get harder. I either do less damage, they do more, etc.
---
At most it could be considered an escort, maybe even RP but in no way would anyone call it a quest? That just sounds like bs to me and I have no idea why you're even arguing it. Similarly why are you even arguing that you need a group for him when not once did I say that you didn't. I was merely pointing out that you don't need a quest to activate the imp boss, that you literally just go and kill him (after chasing him) and loot it. You made it seem like you have to go hunting down an npc to get a quest and the reward from that quest would be the key which wasn't accurate at all. Now it seems like you're pulling any argument out of your ass because you were corrected and you can't admit to being wrong.
---
Incontinent people hate him.
---
This video is a work of art.

I like to smash my keyboard.

You just need to persist dude, you should easily be able to do 1 run per 20 mins with 5/8
---
37....
---
Also something that preach brought up that is concerning:
---
That since alot of people who were fed up with retail left and went to classic. So now the people left in retail, in Blizzard's eyes, like the direction retail has gone. 
---
So they will escalate the way they have been changing retail since they see it as the people left in retail enjoy what it has become. Our hardcore and/or longtime fans are in classic and they are happy. 
---
So retail will become more of what alot of us dont like because they think they can keep everybody happy by just having classic servers. 
---
I'm not optimistic about retail ever recovering.
---
Yeah that dudes a dumbfuck
---
As of right now, blizzard has stated no realms transfers will be available. Knowing them, it's bound to change one way or another.
---
I used to do the same thing in retail when everybody is just waiting to get summoned, just kick one guy and suddenly everybody is moving their arse to the entrance.
---
Fuck them all to death!
---
Go to sleep. You’re starting to see things.
---
I doubt it. PvP is a seperate entity than PvE, but its rewards, unlike PvE, have been missing so far. I think it's vital to release the honor gear ASAP to give people a reason to actually PvP. Right now there's barely any PvP because it's just not worth most peoples time to dismount and kill someone.
---
The only PvP so far is taking place in front of instance portals where you have the support of your group members, knowing you will win the fights and have an oh-shit button in form of the instance portal you can just hop into in case things go wrong.

This is better than anything Chris Metzen has ever done.

Yep, that's the true non-stealther experience
---
Only answer worth reading so far
---
Right? Im playing on an rppvp server and my guild is filled with people who have full time jobs. Familys, other obligations. We downed Ragnaros  on our first raid with a few pugs and then again last week with 31 people. 
---
People just need to stop being toxic and stop complaining about how other people play the game.
---
Ah yes, just because a story is told about a particular things means that the entity that wrote that story is advocating for that thing. 
---
Galaxy brain takes coming from the_donald posters as per usual
---
Novagh? You forgot to cross out one name xD
---
Lol. This guy thinking your body is going to die on board. *sharpens mind control*
---
Yeah. Its really doing exactly what it says on the tin isn't it. Those are auras. It shows you the durations.
---
Not even tsm4 tracks price over time if items. It's huge but that would make the database of information massive. Think about taking the entire AH database and spending it to yesterday's database. Then do that every day.
---
Just greedy people getting mad. As long as you asked first, I don't see a problem.
---
Its a setting built into the game. In UI settings you can turn it on.
---
because you can't find in game-friends?
---
Aren't you a little short to be an undead?
---
Yeah...I had some RL shit to deal with and have gotten behind. This aint good...
---
is it troll if i level my hunter as MM? does everyone go BM? i have a 60 rogue so i can give him items and such but jw what the best/quickest to level was
---
Try lock I’d say
---
I have been in 7-8 guild runs so far and only 2 hunter boes have dropped.
---
iron grenade  iron grenade   did I say iron grenade?
---
Not like I was doing anything meaningful before playing. But I do think about what would have happened if I don’t start smoking weed on the daily.
---
I sell them as FAPs mostly
---
Stop crying and blaming everything on streamers. It’s just the honor system you dingus.
---
Oh wow I always thought you needed a specific moonwell out in the world (ashenvale i think) for mooncloth? Was it always like this?
---
Yes, but you eventually find a few people you like to play with and that leads to possibly joining their guild or just discord and farming dungeons together and then who knows.....maybe you stay friends with them for 15 years and consider them one of your closest buds. 
---
Who knows. I’ve seen it happen.
---
Wyrmslayer shoulders, nice.  I have them as well, way better than the shoulders from ZF
---
I suppose. it surely owuldn't be demanding for the addon to just note the value on the tooltip though? all it has to do is read how much gold left your bags and then write a tooltip note with the date. idk, i dont know anything about coding.
---

I disagree. A nerd playing WoW in 2006 and a nerd in Vanilla WoW is incredibly different. The normie culture is rampant and there's no general connection with everyone you meet simply because you both are dorks who love computer games. It's not really WoW's fault, just the way the world works now. I miss the nerds, freaks, and losers community of WoW.
---
should've rolled on a pve server then
---
Timeless proto drake

I get a lot of hate for farming and selling 34 Eye of Shadows as well.
---
MC is very easy but I see what you're saying! You'll find some likeminded peoples for sure!
---
Do I need to be wayward?
---
Expensive?  On incendiuos black lotus go for 70g+ each.  More so on raid night.
---
The part that gets very annoying is when you try to roll on multiple specs in a single instance. I myself find it annoying when a tank wants to roll on heal gear but I realize there is varying opinions on that.. but I stand firm that regardless of how things play out you should only be rolling on one type of items throughout. The ONLY exception being if you ask and there is no one who minds. If all four others dgaf, there is no issue of course. But if the healer has issue it is of my belief that you should yield to them especially if you're taking tank gear at the same time.
---
Buy a Gutripper for like 20g on AH

agreed. went into ubrs as heals and came out with 2 tanking pieces. shield and waist or something. i did ask first though if the tanks needed it. always MS&gt;OS. if u want ur OS stuff u ask.
---
37. we gots this.
---
Quel Serar is better imo, but I also have a felstriker in my OH as well
---
lol
---
Almostwipe 
---
&lt;Olympus&gt;
---
That's what she said
---
T2 robes are better than TFV comfortably
---
may i ask. are you horde or ally?
---
if horde, how is the RP/PvP of the horde on that server?
---
Is it that different from a PvP Server, or is the RP so minimal its not really a thing?
---
nothing/welfare. who cares?
---
the secret to WC is always turn left
---
What if you did the Ony attunement at 60, but dinged 60 a month earlier than the OP?
---
I didn’t.
---
I'm down to come and help.
---
Is this a GW2 blob? lol
---
Erm okay, let's use your logic. One should only roll on one type of item. My item type of choice is healer. Why is it necessary to yield to a healer when you are also a healer end game? It's not as if tanks yield to dps for dps items.
---
Most casuals are much higher than level 37. Even my friends who barely have time to play are in their 50s.
---
&gt; Additionally, there has been enough concepts and content created that it is feasible that future enhancements can be largely a la carte selections that are then reintroduced into the game at a much lower developmental cost than before.
---
This has always been how I imagined classic+. Why does a raid or dungeon *need* to be level 70 or 80 or 90 or whatever the fuck level you can get to in retail now? Why cant they take the same place, scale it down to 60, and bam, new content. Take out parts that dont work in classic, like if you need flying to progress or whatever. 
---
Zones and quests? Rework them so theres more variety in leveling. Does a zone really need to be level 80? Bring it down to level 30 and give players another zone to go through when theyre leveling up their 5th alt. 
---
Gear? Give us some offspec gear, or alternative gear. People always say players wont run dungeons to get it because its minimally different, but people are running dungeons hundreds of times now to get a 1% damage increase. If the contents there, people will do it. 
---
I've never played retail beyond actual vanilla, but I cant imagine raids and things are so crazy complex theres no way to integrate them without having to give us millions of damage or massive level cap increases. People say they wont invest any money into this, but they had a team recreate the entire game on a new engine, I dont think its out of the realm of possibility that the same team would be capable of accomplishing this.
---
That makes sense.  thanks!
---
I see this as a joke. It may be or not funny, but its just a joke.
---
To shreds you say...
---
So fuck You to people who can’t put real life on hold to level :( I was under the impression we had until mid December
---
you can set your hearth to desolace and have everyone leave the group and ghetto hearth out instead of suiciding
---
If you’re looking to sell, I would use an add on like auctioneer or TSM to scan the AH over a couple weeks. Then you’ll have some data points to know how to price the item. The scans are quick too. I use auctioneer and the get all scan takes seconds. 
---
Whether you sell it or not is up to you. For rare drops, I usually ask my guildies if someone could use it otherwise I sell. I have one piece of twink gear I’ve picked up and I’m holding that until BGs come out and then I’ll post it.
---
He really crapped all over their experience
---
I mean... Everything in moderation? We all need an outlet.
---
damn, role players talk shit so much more eloquently than us regular playing plebs
---
I know it is an old post. But I tend to favor the pushback talent for hellfire and rain of fire. It's nice to have improved damage from imp,  but in raids and pvp the imp often does easily due to the lack of hp. The most viable tradeoff for SM/Ruin over DS/Ruin is the imp buff. I'm always put in group 1 with the tanks, and my imp stays passively in phase shift.
---
Those are shamans, they just appear pink on raid frames.
---
Cuz they're pressures by lunatics playing 30+ hours a week.
---
This shouldn't affect +spell damage
---
It's really not that hard to choose one thing at a time to roll on. Imagine how annoying it would be to be member of a run where the pally tank was taking tank gear, also took healer drops because we all know pally is endgame healer, oh yeah and he also need rolls on dps because, duh, offspec ret.
---
Your first and second sentence already contradicts each other lol. But yeah, it's like I said, somehow it is okay for tanks to grab dps items but not heal items? Even though the line of logic allowing tanks to grab dps items (endgame roles) is the same?
---
Yes, a paladin rolling on all items is greedy and out of place. I don't roll on dps items (2H) ever.
---
Be less judgy
---
Pagle
---
I think it's a shame the past 2 cinematics were centered around her. Everything seems to be about her. That's cool I guess but its shame with all the rich lore they have at their disposal.
---
I think people hate her because blizzards marketing team discovered she is really popular so they write the story around her.
---
Didn't it take 5-6 months for the honor system to come out in vanilla? Having it come out 2.5 months from release will probably cause casuals to quit pvp servers. I'm new to wow in general so I dont know exactly how this will go but I can bet that there are far more high lvls ready to farm honor and it will make the game hell for the majority of the playerbase. I'm only lvl 35 but I already get corpse camped at least once a day without this system in place so I can only imagine once this starts I wont be able to lvl at all. That means I have 11 days to go 25 levels and even then I won't have the gear or the consumables to survive.  This seems to be catering to the streamer community and the people who have the time to put most of their time in game. I've had a great time so far and I thought I'd have the time to somewhat participate in Wpvp but it sounds like I'll need yo reroll in a PVE server just to experience the rest of the game.
---
The lighting with the current version of the engine that Classic runs on is not the same as the old one. Check the sub to see the difference.
---
Meanwhile I'm level 24 over here.
---
Would you be interested of seeing my screenshot of a starter zone and reading my 12 paragraph essay about how much this game means to me, and how glad I am to be playing classic?
---
I have been against cleaving leveling so far, but i guess I Will be doing cleaving about 1.5 week
---
Funny part is that everyone's already done DM a bazillion times already
---
????????????
---
I feel like this is really soon... Or I just level really slow. Damn this having a life
---
like 80%?
---
They don't want to spend time with you either.
---
Ah, are you then in the camp on of tanks should only be rolling on tank stuff? Absolutely no dps gear at all if someone else needs it as well in the group? With that, then we have no contradiction.  
---
I follow wowhead. Regardless, it was an upgrade for healing which I was doing.
---
I'm in a server first super hardcore guild. Nobody is happy with this. Especially with consumable requirements in Vanilla. People want downtime to gather resources to prepare. I don't want to be splitting time between PVPing, world bosses and farming gold. 
---
Unless the undoing of #nochanges is to gut the consumable/world buff system then we strongly want this to not come out for months.
---
Bullshit. It's more like people are over hyping the first half of BRD, which you can reasonably do at 50-52. Yeah, no 60s want to do it, because most of the dungeon is grey for them and the boss drops are generally garbage.
---
The average for hitting 60 is probably about 8.5 days. I did it in 7 days on both my 60s. The fact that I almost have a 3rd 60 and I have taken just entire weeks off because of work tells me you guys are slow.
---
lol pugs
---
But it's not legendary at all
---
Swimming is fun for my SHAMAN.
---
Can we get an F in chat for all the hunters doing their rhok'delar demons after honor goes live? I finished mine already but had huge issues with people griefing me while I was kiting the mobs in Ungoro and Burning Steppes. I wasn't even worth pointa at the time.
---
I would say most people do...that's why we are here on Classic...if I wanted flying mounts and daily quests and an empty Azeroth and a dead community due to cross realm dungeon finder I would just play retail then...I can't explain to you how much I love classic other than I think it's the greatest multiplayer RPG ever made....And it started to nose dive in quality with WotLK. 
---
I liked level 70 content, but I thought resilance ruined pvp as you simply had to grind for it to be competitive. TBC killed world pvp on Azeroth as everyone started to just fly around then.
---
Nobody in this game is willing to help people, even guildes. I've played this game every day since launch and there has been one instance of some guy going out of his way to help me for nothing in return.
---
Thank you Warlock that helped me get my attunement.
---
Through brute force, you learn. Some don’t have that amount of time.
---
It can be incredibly irritating playing with friends that live by this standard yet never get better but instead complain that they are not as good as you.
---
If there are tools that make you better to enjoy the game at a more competitive lvl, I’ll take it. Will he use it... probably not. Lol
---
Wow.
---
Right, but there will be people hunting for honor in zones with 48's and I don't think they will just spare the 45's. That's why I said 45+ (because of zone levels).
---
i love my droodad but no way in hell are they any threat to the 1-10 unassisted leveling world championship elimination contender bracket challenge.
---
&gt; Yeah it only works on the mob that dodged
---
I'm aware, it's that when I target that mob again I can't use Overpower anymore.
---
My belief was that you should yield to the healer if you're adamant that you also want to need on tank gear. If you're not going to need on tank and dps stuff and you want to roll on healer stuff only then the healer might not mind. If you explain that you're only tanking to fill the role and get the group moving along then I doubt anyone has a problem with you choosing to roll for healer stuff. The issue only begins to arise when you are insistent on rolling on multiple sets of gear in the same run. And I also stated at the same time that if no cared then it's no harm done. But in the event that someone does care, you should yield to them otherwise you're the asshole at that point.
---
A true man of the cloth
---
Depends, horde or alliance?  Alliance has more drama and awful guilds than anything I have ever experienced.  Horde seems fantastic though.
---
Well that's stupidly early. What happened to 6 months? Guess I'm going to unsub, maybe come back in 2020. Smh they really just fucked up everything about launching classic.
---
I feel like I spend a ton of time there, but I'm a druid. I'll port to moonglade more often then I hearth sometimes. It's grown on me :)
---
Calrouge the redheaded rogue. You can probably guess her favourite colour.
---
Ya that’s the problem I had with Classic. When I was into it, it was all I would think about the rest of my day and all day I’d just be thinking about playing it later. Like when I first was into WoW back in the day. Any time that I had I would play it and then get sucked in for the rest of the day.
---
I had fun with it for a while, but I don’t think my brain is wired to just be able to play it “just a little bit”
---
Easy there buddy.
---
you're a slow learner, no?
---
Democrats were the segregationists, blocked civil rights, embraced the KKK and many democrats were members. But no, they didn't found the organization, so I guess big win for you and historical accuracy...
---
Also, Nazis were socialists and so are the democrats.
---
So what exactly do you expect? Do you really want Blizz to wait 3-5 years until literally every last person has made it to level 60 and has every piece of BiS gear?
---
If you are a casual, then why does it bother you to have the content released quicker for the sake of the semi-hardcore and hardcore players? What harm does it do to you when there are others ahead of you who DO have the time?
---
This feels like retail all over again. "I want to be on the same level as everybody else, no matter how much I invest into the game"
---
No, you should always be rolling for the role that you are performing in a dungeon. The issue here is that you got matched with a couple of assholes at first, and then you assumed that was the norm. It definitely is not. You're always free to ask if nobody else needs the item, but if you're healing you shouldn't roll on tank items, if you're healing you shouldn't roll on dps items, etc. You can always roll greed and sometimes get lucky with gearing your offspec.
---
Yeah. Now with that said, there's a social aspect of it. If you're the group leader, you can absolutely advertise that you're going to roll on DPS gear for example. I'm all for communication. I just don't like when someone is going after multiple sets without clearing it with their group, or putting that pressure once loot has already dropped. 
---
I just think if things are not cleared before-hand, it comes off as a bit rude to go against someone after the fact something dropped. If that makes sense. 
---
Also that makes sense. I used Arbiter's for a bit healing as well. I just warn because Prot Pally is somewhat unique in the sense that because they use so many stats, gearing is just as much an extension of your 'build' than anything else.
---
I played solo up to 55 as a priest. Enjoyed every minute and turned down like 20+ guild invites. I finally found the right guild at 55 and enioy it even more!
---
We are discussing this because there is an contradiction in your statements. I am playing tank, I choose to roll on heal items only, healer objects. Why should I yield? Because that is what you said I should do since I take tank gear (which nobody objects to and you say it's okay to need it all day). That's the contradiction.
---
Flying mounts are such a drastic game changer I don't think they should add them again. I standby that Blizzard doesn't actually know why warcraft a legendary game. Each expansion just made it worse. Classic is beautiful in its imperfections with a strong emphasis on community and teamwork. It's a fantastic RPG, one of the best. I did also enjoy level 70 content but for a few reasons I would prefer to keep it level 60, or it won't be classic anymore, but just slowly starting up again all the bullshit that started to ruin wow like pvp resilience, cross realm finder, empty azeroth, etc.
---
I keep hearing this scam repeated ad nauseum these days. It's very unlikely, probably just doesn't know what he's doing.
---
Oooooo yea
---
I honestly think they should slow it down, not for my sake but for the sake of the no lifers ruining their lives stuck to a screen.
---
jesus, enjoy your "turf wars".
---
Fuck the enclave
---
It didn’t drop a single time in the last weeks, so there was nothing to roll
---
Ya for sure, it’s just a misconception that you need thousands of gold to experience all the content of classic, it’s not the case.
---
I feel like it's gonna be another draenor where the entire premise is the story of just to bring back popular characters that they killed off.
---
Avyndriel, Proxx, Kel, and the rest of the GIS are all great people and you guys should join them!!
---
Okay, so why is it acceptable to give tanks free pass to dps items but not heal items? You admit to tanking just to get the group faster, why not the same for a pally, which other choice is to heal? You could simply replace word for word all your anecdotes. "I don't take anything from the melee dps. I might roll on a sword/cape/trinket with a caster but I've never had any complaints about that"   
---
Which both are not true, plenty of posts to show that there is plenty of drama from either cases. But yeah, most people agree with you, tanks get free pass to dps but why not heals?
---
BGs should've been out by release so no.
---
It sounds like someone's worried about losing a roll to a paladin...
---
This is high art.
---
Straight to the Louvre with this one.
---
Hmm was hoping they'd announce when Phase 3 would be, even on a rough timeline (like Q1 2020), as well as when paid transfers will be coming.
---
That'd be wayyy to fast considering the phases after p2 have a lot more content than p1 and p2
---
Just had a chat with some guildies about the trailer. For all of his power and influence it really seems like TLK should have had more than a hundred or so nameless undead around to throw at any intruders.
---
Sylvanas really should have been the warchief after Thrall and they could have tied her madness and fear of death together with the story Garrosh had. Inatead she stuck around and just wasn't ever taken seriously enough by those around her to just get rid of her due to how dangerous she had become. Now she is a Bleach protagonist and works for a death god.
---
I'm not quite sure I understand the spell check question, but no it's an ignore list and spam filter it doesn't do anything with spell checking.
---
You could probably create filters to not show messages that have smilies, but it doesn't alter people's chat. Is smiley spamming an issue on some servers?
---
Why a tank?
---
Yeah, I'm good friends with Captain Obvious.
---
Imply most dps have gotten more that one item after 7-8 weeks of raiding
---
Lets hope they didn't then ;)
---
Sulfuras for sure
---
Agreed, one of the reasons I bought it and eventually quit over for a lack of.
---
Whether or not Blizz wants to ban them is on them, but using the threat of the FBI and bringing up the boogyman of "online radicalization" crosses many significant lines. "Online" is just a meeting place of people communicating. This person seemingly wants the government to get between people communicating, spreading their ideas. What is and is not "radicalization" is incredibly nebulous. To anyone paying attention, it's clearly a wedge that will be used to get between anyone communicating about taking back the reigns of power from the ruling elite class, that this guy is obviously a part of.
---
&gt; Why the fuck are you talking about monitors? Do you literally not know the difference between a COMPUTER and a MONITOR?
---
Do you need to know the difference between equipment used to play a game and changes to the actual game?
---
The game is the same, the way you experience is changed
---
It's not irrelevant, you are wron
---
We are playing Classic, which is a re-release of vanilla with few changes
---
You find me ridiculous and dumb? That's ironic, because I'm fairly sure i've explained 3 times to you why you're wrong about this and you still can't understand it :(
---
DM actually came out a month after vanilla wow just like in classic. DM was originally slated for the original 2004 release but got delayed.
---
I’m currently level 11, so may not be doable lol
---
They should balance out the servers i dont really want to play with 10:1 horde vs alliance, its boring
---
Man screw that guild. I've heard nothing but bad thems from them and experienced just as bad. I'll be sure no mercy is set on any nelf warriors from that guild, should I encounter "it".
---
My brain is telling me this guy has a cheesy french accent when I look at this picture.
---
I wasn't really talking about the resource competition; that's just gonna happen on a huge server no matter what you do. I was responding to your comment that you've never "hear[d] or ran into these guilds." They're all extremely populous. Framing it as though they're defunct or tiny is misleading.
---
No one cares.
---
I've seen some guides on youtube how to solo it as a lvl 60 mage.
---
Worked for me!
---
You forgot the part where a hunter comes in and takes the node
---
That moment you find out your guild has a territory...
---
Thank you for this lmao
---
Is there a video guide that goes over key pvp abilities of all the classes? I wish to learn to read abilities and animations before phase 2 comes.
---
It is comments like this that help maintain my addiction for WoW. I’m luckily only able to play 2 days a week while my lady is at work. With a baby on the way I’m grateful to be setting up healthy Warcraft habits. I don’t mean to sound like a douche when I say that. What I mean is your wow addiction has died for our sins. Thank you man.  Hope you have successfully made the efforts to improve your health, your social standings with old friends, and your general happiness.
---
Yup lol
---
200iq strats
---
- pleb who blurred his drawings in high school submissions to make things look more 'abstract'
---
Don’t remember gank zergs as “the golden age of world PvP” by any means, but ok.
---
Pretty sure that was release, leveling and before everyone was raiding.
---
lol.
---
it’s because of the roles, heal - tank don’t go hand in hand. ALOT of “dps” loot is just as good for tanking(hit gear specifically) as it is for dpsing and are used by both tanks and dps. And that’s very convenient for a warrior tank to roll on since it will be useful in both fury and prot spec. Hand of justice, tarnished elven ring, Eldritch reinforced leg plates, Ironfoe. The list goes on, just making a point.
---
What's funny about this?
---
I'd solo trib runs foe the oblivious plebs watching

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dqg3ge/is_capital_city_raiding_going_to_be_more_common/). 
---
Is this on a PVE server or something? Why isn’t anyone flagged? I’m always flagged
---
But it is true
---
Yes, I am implying that.
---
And judging by the state of retail for the last 6 months, my implications are pretty much **spot on**.
---
If they could do everything you just said, *retail would not be in it's current state and be so looked down upon by SO MANY who are currently addicted to classic.*
---
Etiquette is usually MS&gt;OS. I.E. if you joined the group as tank, you would get the tank items. Vise versa for heals. There are items that overlap though.
---
At the end of the day, if you make the group then it's your rules. Whether people stay or not is entirely up to them.
---
This congressman is a dumbass trying to get attention. Whats blizzard gonna do have an autoban system that suspends everyone who puts on all white robes. Just report it and fucking move on. This guy is just another politician fishing for brownie points with "social issues".
---
I love these so much...
---
My life. But you forget, we don't just cast frostbolt m, we also make drinks for people. It's hard I know.. But don't forget it
---
If you are going to maintain your sanity while playing this game, (at least with the current generation of players) I would strongly recommend that you abandon use of the word "should," in your thinking.
---
Do not expect anything of anyone who you play with.  Don't expect anyone to know how to play their class; because people frequently will not.  Don't expect anyone to pass on or otherwise be generous with loot, because people who do so are the exception, rather than the rule.
---
In terms of people knowing what gear they do or do not need; it's relatively normal among the two most recent generations, for people to be systemically dishonest, and to rationalise that they can take whatever they want, purely because it is there, and they want it.  If pressed, they might offer you some superficial justification for it; but they don't believe said justification themselves, so you shouldn't either.
---
If someone ninjas, put them on your ignore list and move on.
---
Probably not because of civilians. One person gets one DK and the entire raid loses tons of honor
---
Can have alts sign it, or just pay a few people in a capital city 1g to sign it.
---
But thats the point. This changes everything. People let you get on with shit because barely anyone is PvPing. Out in force or not everyones going to be killing everything in sight. This is going to introduce the honor system. Imagine how many PvPers there are on your server that would be in BGs. Now imagine that many of them will be dedicating 4-8+ hours a day to it, yet there is no BGs
---
Not a single thing you listed has to do with lvl 60 progression. Starting alts means you are literally starting the game over because you're out of content. Farming consumables isn't needed for any content in the game currently. Sub level 60s can easily clear MC with a full 40 raid. If you didn't have detailed knowledge of the next 5 content releases you would 100% be done with your max characters. 
---
Working towards content and stockpiling for AQ are not the same lol
---
If people like you wouldn't exist, ninjas wouldn't either
---
think about that next time you roll greed and complain about a ninja
---
Fase

Majority of people in Vanilla played during a BG honor system

&gt; It may be or not funny, but its just a joke.

How can you tell?

I think it's part of the addon that gives a more detailed stats summary. The numbers on the gear icons is the items' ilvl.
---
&gt;I'm not talking about recently, the KKK lost all it's power over past 40 years since racism has become socially unacceptable
---
Of course it has :\^) 
---
&gt;any candidate they embrace now can expect a 5 point hit in the polls. They carried real political power for a long time. The history of America and the history of the democrat party are deeply linked to the KKK, you shouldn't try to deny the basic reality. It's a cheap ploy to bring it up these days but you are even cheaper for trying to white wash the left's history.
---
It's not "the left's history" and you've failed to substantiate a single point you've made. It's convenient how you dipshits always just straight up ignore anything that contradicts your talking points. 
---
&gt;The Nazis were in fact socialists, but they also enacted many no nonsense capitalist policies that streamlined their economy in the short term, so I'll grant you that it's somewhat muddy.
---
What socialist policies did they enact?
---
I've been playing WoW since launch, up through Wotlk.  Did plenty of BGs and PvP raid content.  Never once did I even have any desire to play on a pvp server.  
---
My main is only level 37 now, and the few hours a week I can devote to the game, I sure as fuck don't want to spend it worrying about getting murdered.  I honestly don't get the fascination with being on a pvp server.
---
I've accepted that there are dps AND tank items. Hand of Justice being the example brought up (but come on, it's obviously for dps lol). Tanks can roll on them, these overlapping loot. Regardless, I'm talking about dps items that are NOT for tanks. Like Savage Gladiator Chest and various non plate pieces.
---
Everyone in this sub : I'm super casual, barely play an hour a week, yet I have 2 60s geared in epics from MC/ONY with their epic mounts. Phase 2 can't come soon enough. You guys are nubs.
---
Yeah, ruined.
---
Isn't it 'Bonereaver's Edge'?
---
My realm (Whitemane) still layers me when I join groups about half the time. If they were to turn it off it would be incredibly overpopulated so I, too, declare myself correct :-p
---
And stared down the barrel of another day, spent farming water essence so I can buy a 40% speed increase
---
Did you discuss beforehand what would happen on BoE drops? If not, finders keepers. Always need
---
I mean while the 2.5g per day is barely anything, I’ve made a lot by checking the margins using TSM add on. It shows which pots have which margins. My most successful was Fire Protection Potions (the normal ones) where I was able to make 70s profit on each pot and made about 100g profit in 20 mins by buying out the auction house. 
---
I know different servers have different prices, but I’m sure there are some potions that are profitable and easy to make money.
---
Play horde.
---
By Hand of Justice this started reeking hard then I saw you trying to make the case for Gladiator Chain and this pretty obviously becomes a "I'm a loot whore" comming out.
---
Are you on a pvp server?  They are putting in the honor system, so if you are on a pvp server, or flag yourself, you can and will be killed by players from the other faction.
---
Anything with a dedicated GPU will be more than enough.

Only played paladin in vanilla but hunters and warlocks were by far... by far... my worst world pvp matchups. Engineering can help close the gap.

Yeah I mean it's just two respecs a week. Not that expensive and going fury let's me farm gold much faster.

If you go MM you'll pull aggro off your pet easier and end up melee attacking things to death. BM is much easier to solo.
---
Hillsbrad is such a fun area. Park your main in UC and level alt in hillsbrad. Ganking becomes a problem join up with some other low levels and start a resistance. If a high level is around causing the trouble then log into main and start a war.
---
As a healer, I don’t care.
---
Yes. The class quests in ST are meant to be catch ups as wel as the .5 tier sets

I only thought it was Faerlina because lolstreamerserver.

Guess we have a week and a half to see who's right in the end. XD

So the battlegrounds - these are coming later? This is just world pvp and honor?
---
Yah that works too I just feel like the muscle memory from actually doing something in the enviroment where its applicable is more viable because in the addons situation you are presented an image which you shouldnt be looking at your actionbar in a fight unless you need to see like a cooldown counter. Idk either way Im not trying to flame him or say its bad I was just putting in my 2 cents.
---
You’re a ninja.
---
Absolutely.
---
It sure as shit is in this situation.
---
now there is an incentive to kill you, so no more nice opposing factions
---
Yeah oof, Savage Glad Chain as well? Heh, aggro generation. But yeah, some leather pieces? And finally, we get to the point. Somehow...it's okay for that to happen (warrior tank grabs leather) but healing items is not, even though for pally, the end game choice is heals. So yeah, that's the thing that makes me wonder.   
---
Others here have stayed firmly in the, only loot your current role camp, which is fine.
---
It’s a great lesson for every future tank to know LOS and being careful about surroundings.
---
Seriously. The thought process of “roll on a PvP server” -&gt; “get pissed about more PvP” is one i don’t understand.
---
If someone is upset that new content is being released faster than they wanted for the game they barely have time to play then obviously it’s worth something to them or they wouldn’t go on a forum to complain about it.
---
Excelling in a hobby feels good, if it doesn’t, then you should quit that hobby.

---
Who is we. Lol you think you speak ob behalf of people. Quiten down nobody.
---
You want an intel i5 or i7 (I don't know what's current for AMD but it will be Ryzen something, they are apparently fine, just do some reading and comparisons), 8gb of DDR4 RAM, a GTX 1060 6GB (careful there is a 3gb they try to sneak in), an SSD no less than 256 GB and a 1 or 2 TB standard hard drive, and a decent wifi card if you aren't directly plugging in. 
---
What's more important is to ask yourself a few questions:
---
A) will WoW be the only game I play. It doesn't need much so it won't be hard to buy for. If you want to play newer AAA games you need to look at system specs for some and get an idea of what you need.
---
B) what else is the PC for as you will want something powerful for editing videos and such, but a toaster will browse the net and run Word if that's all you want.
---
C) what's the budget? You can get a pre-built gaming rig and it will cost you not just for the parts but also for the name on the side and the "cool factor" they tend to exude. You can also find a decent PC that you get the store to add a Video card to, I've done this before and used it for years because the core specs were that good. If you have a friend that builds them or a store that offers a fair charge for putting it together (~$50 let's say) then get the parts you want and you will save cash. This question nos probably the most important as it's what matters the most. A guy may want a Porsche but that doesn't matter if all he can afford is a Chevy
---
And don't forget to budget for a monitor, mouse and keyboard, in that order. Monitor is obvious, but while the mouse and keyboard will be included most likely, replacing them with decent gaming ones is just nice if you can.
---
It’s a good time to be on a PvE server.
---
Find low key out of the way spots, put in a podcast and grind.
---
Best Goldmaking in vanilla is Alchemie by far
---
Yeah, hence the post to get the reddit consensus (or lack thereof).   
---
Okay then yeah, if you are purely in the ms &gt; os, no tank and heal exception, we are good, I can accept that. No double standard here. But remember, tanks and healers might have the easier queue but they are recognised to be the more tedious roles to play. The roles are skewed further due to the raid composition, less tanks and healers to the standard 1:1:3 ratio. That was the reasoning behind letting tanks roll on dps stuff.
---
If you're below level 50 it makes literally no difference. You're not going to get camped by 60s if you're not worth honor to them. Yes level 50 to 60 might be shittier than normal for 4 to 6 weeks until WSG drops.
---
0 Spell damage rings and ephemeral talismans, but 6 mageblades/staffs.
---
The top player on warcraftlogs right now doesn't even do it.
---
You had Elizabeth Tauren right there and you left it
---
Thorium nodes on reserve.
---
You have to be 35 to go above 225. But theres no level requirement for any bandage type
---
This is the correct response
---
Do you know what you're talking about?
---
Sylvanas is like Gul'dan who carried over to the next expansion in Legion. I doubt she will die in the first raid though.
---
I know it's for gameplay reasons, but if she could rip the Helm of Domination in half and beat the Lich King and his army like nothing, she should've been able to wipe out the Alliance and (especially) the Horde easily. The story is such an inconsistent joke.
---
The writers are just mish mashing all the past Warcraft plot points together now. Sprinkle in a some Pandaria. Add a dash of Warcraft 3. Put in a spoonful of Wrath of the Lich King. Splash some Warlords on top. Blend em all in a portal. TADA you got shit writing.
---
Mind control meta to keep their body far enough away from the entrance to keep farming
---
When leveling a rogue, two thing are important. 1) good weapons every 5ish levels. You want slow mainhand, fast offhand. This makes sinister strike better. 
---
2) when leveling, kill everything between you and your quest that gives xp. If you run across the whole map to kill 10 mobs, and turn in a quest, you might net 2k xp. But if you kill every mob there and back, you are more efficient as you're gaining xp and traveling at the same time. It makes a difference so you can be overleveled for the next zone.
---
That's deep.
---
Two different names in the same line.
---
YMMV.
---
At first yeah, Classic WoW during the first couple weeks were grand. Everyone was super nice and helpful.
---
Overtime though, those old habits came back. More people became less happy and back to their old bitch ways.
---
You only will die once or twice anyway, it’s almost impossible to perma camp someone.. (also not worth your time refarming the same people tbh)
---
Ehh, P3 is BGs and BWL, right? A large number of guilds will have that on farm within a month, easily. P4 is ZG, expect day 1 farm mode for groups in full t2. P5 has the silithid invasion event which could take a bit.
---
In a normal case that’s a tough one, if Warrior and Pally both have similar gear, performance, attendance... it should go to the Warrior (speaking from bias). Now if everything else is the same but Pally has worse weapons (idk why but just this scenario) I can see the reason with Pally getting his wet dream gift. It would benefit the team as a whole better even if individually it wouldn’t be as well optimized.  
---
But when you have a 90 DPS Paladin... I’d probably give it to Hunter in the off-chance he melee’s before giving it to that Pally lol. There is undergeared and there is not trying/playing poorly. It sucks but you have to think of the entire team more than pleasing an individual. Now if 38 players are cool with it than go for it.
---
LOL
---
And although I don't fully agree, I can at least see and appreciate where people are coming from. If I were in a group that couldn't find a healer and a pally said hey guys I can tank this to get us going but I'm only desiring to roll on heal gear.. I'm not sure I would personally want that. I'd probably leave and let them find a cloth healer or someone who didn't care. And again no harm done. 
---
I think communication beforehand is what makes all the difference to be honest. It gives everyone the fair chance to agree on how stuff will play out and be okay with it, or leave. No surprise later. That I think we can all agree on.
---
That's a pretty lame way to end an argument mate
---
Just like Classic there will likely be a lot of porting issues and work.
---
Thank you! I haven't owned a pc since that crappy Dell I got at Best buy in middle school.
---
And I haven't played much video games as I've been travelling a lot of the last few years. So WoW will likely be the only game I play for a while.
---
Thanks for all the info my friend
---
Using 3rd party software to make **one** keypress do **multiple** actions for you violates ToS because it **IS** considered botting.  
---
    
---
You also can't just hit a keyboard macro that plays continuously through the night, hitting your TSM sniper macro at inhuman speeds.
---
If you're level sixty you only ever need one pot per attempt.
---
Yes because having this level of basement dwelling to keep up with a game is totally reasonable.
---
Imagine not understanding a JOKE lol
---
Gotta get your melee high warlord weapons bruh.
---
So you spent money to go to blizzcon and used that time to run ZF?
---
Play in the morning and go to bed earlier to compensate
---
This. Before the downvotes, aside from the aesthetics aspect it confers an advantage in pvp such as hiding the fact you're wearing a rocket helm or mind control cap and in general opponents get less of a sense of gear level when these two items are hidden.
---
That's not how guidelime works if it was guiding u away from the barrens it's because u had to do something first.
---
True for the campers, but you that just wanna run Ines will probs just die once or twice getting in. It’s impossible to perma camp someone lol since the red closer and closer to the entrance eventually
---
This :) I'm still leveling (lvl 31 atm) and I try to PvP quite often. Most people however just don't want to PvP back.
---
"I can't argue your points, so I'm going to call you uneducated lol"
---
Warlocks cannot use fear or horror effects against the undead. OP stated it was an undead mage he was fighting. 
---
This is decent advice for PvP as a warlock against any mage except the undead, where it is useless.
---
These guys are way easier when you invite someone to quest together
---
A good warlock is insane. Outstanding PVP with gear, great at farming things like DMN and Mara. I'd also recommend Hunter they are the same in both aspects but id argue better in WPVP if you open on someone at range they are as good as dead if you can get good at avoiding deadzoning. Both high skill ceiling.
---
lol no they're not. " Should we spend money, time, manpower, and so much effort making new content for 'classic +', or just put out TBC with very little effort and people will buy that shit up cuz they loved it? " its a no brainier for a for profit corporation.
---
/framestack
---
WoTF is a one use cd? whenever I duel or fight a UD mage just cast fear twice because 99% of them wotf as soon as they get feared lol
---
I would even be okay with them nerfing Naxx gear. Or they could add gear that helps other classes out that fall off. Let's be real though, classic very obviously heavily favors 4 classes and I'm sure you know exactly what ones those are without even having to think about it. There are things to love and hate about classic and tbc. If they fix what either of those two things broke then that'd be ideal.
---
The quest for getting 225-300 does require lvl 35, but you can use the book at any lvl and get to 225 skill. So you can technically use this bandage on lvl 1 but not make it.
---
My guild is setting up 5-10 man teams to go after all the best farming locations and leveling spots.
---
Padres Trousers are much better.
---
When someone displays a certain level of ignorance you know they aren't someone who even gives a shit about what's true and not true anyway. My experience tells me it's a big waste of time.
---
keep upgrading your two hander to the best you can get from dungeons or quest. Paladin is the slowest class to level solo, I'd recommend healing in AOE farming groups if you can find them but theyre alot more rare these days
---
People are running through the content faster than the first time. As a point of reference, the world record to 60 in Vanilla was 4d20h, compared to jokerd's record of 2d17h on his third character.
---
You’re a Ninja. As a DPS Warrior (Not even by choice but fulfilling a guild need) I *have* to Tank in order to get my DPS gear. There is no other way for my to obtain it without ninja’ng. Well I could run with Rogues/Hunters/Warriors and just free rolling it on the off chance the boss is there on the off chance he drops the vest and another off chance I happen to get it. But I don’t have a thousand hours and endless prayers. So if I see Paladin I make it clear that I don’t want roll competition. That chain is the sole reason warriors even waste time tanking there, you might as well ask them to volunteer their time and repair bill. I can see a 50/50 HoJ roll but chain is just being greedy.  
---
The biggest difference is Warriors generally don’t roll on multiple sets of gears. If it’s not DPS I don’t want it. Even if a tank item drops I ask group: greed or take? Usually they are cool because it makes everyone’s life easier if you’re not wearing a wooden shield but if 1 person says no I don’t, no matter how much an upgrade it is.  
---
At the end of the day there is no hard rules. I let Rogues, DPS Warriors and Hunters roll on my Mara Ring, and lost to all of them. It’s not a big deal because we agreed before hand and I got XP &amp; Gold. Yeah I needed to run Mara more than I liked but it was my choice, nobody Ninja’d the rings from me. And they stayed and helped me get it which is cool too.  
---
Like hell there were times I let Hunters/Rogues in group and told them it’s cool to roll simply cuz I wanted to group and not wait for 10 hours to party. Just ask, and don’t be disappointed if someone says no.
---
The horde are all animals and just drop it where every they want.
---
Nobody has called you a republican friendo. But you're trying offly hard to protect them from smearing for someone who doesn't care.
---
Most of your posts are an embarrassing admission of ignorance. I lol'd when you said any expert opinion was an "appeal to authority" and provided no counter evidence of your own.
---
That doesn't sound too bad, I expected it to be more
---
Don't worry about rushing through it all of that content that is released will still be there when you're ready for it. If you want a warrior to play in pvp make a warrior. You aren't wasting any time doing anything if you enjoy it and you aren't behind or any silly shit like that you are exactly where you are supposed to be just enjoy it. Stop living for the rat race.
---
Vanilla is very anti-casual. If you can't raid or farm honor you run out of shit to do real fast.
---
Will honor gear available as well?
---
I will add another box to the Building Your Mage section to elaborate on measuring Critical Strike to show examples of Pre-Raid BiS, and variables like Ignite and raid buffs.
---
Check you have the highest Spell rank on your toolbar or keybind.
---
Lol agreed
---
Had an enhancement shaman win one of my pre BIS items and wasn't even the least bit salty because it's pre BIS for his spec too, only to learn he planned on going resto soon to raid and get epics. Man I get that you're not owed anything, but taking things that you're only gonna sometimes use over something someone is always gonna use just sucks ass.
---
I might as well roll need on fun looking caster gear like the crimson felt hat so I can look stylin.
---
You can tank with fury. Most would say that fury tanking is better even.
---
You've never experienced anyone trying to be edgy before? Damn, go watch some PewDiePie and get a taste before taking this so serious.
---
thank you thank you:)
---
Poor Mage who lost the roll to a healer for that hat.
---
Which is stupid.
---
See a lot of hate in here, but nice work dude. Looks like it took you a couple of times to perfect it. Grats!
---
Also any race female doesnt poop. Doesnt happen, nope.
---
*Conservatives* were the segregationists, backers of Jim Crow, etc. The liberal Republicans joined the Democratic party as part of FDR's coalition, and the conservative Democrats were forced out between 1948 and 1968. 
---
But you already knew that and just enjoy lying to people, don't you?
---
It'll be a little more than a year's worth of content if they move at the pace of ~3 months per phase. I personally think that's actually a fine pace to set, mostly because the timeline of Classic is not at all equivalent to vanilla. People were not raidlogging at this point in vanilla. Rag wasn't even close to dead. The dissemination of information means that most people are actually geared intelligently going into MC, and it makes most runs a piece of cake. The content is being exhausted at a much quicker pace due to this. Hell, even all the people complaining "but I'm not at 60" are still miles ahead of the average players in vanilla at this time. P much everyone who is at 58+ has been in MC at this point, or should have tried to go. It's not going to be the absolute most l33t people going to AQ40, it's going to be any guild with a raid team, and probably a bunch of pugs to fill spots.
---
i didn't even know that was a thing lol we were forced to type in 7th grade here with classes (more than a decade ago), now my fingers are all nimbly and quick.
---
Excellent composition! Rule of thirds, juxtaposition of scale. Well done!
---
Still waiting for the pretend spellbatching to go.
---
I am playing on a pvp server alliance and everyone is super nice.
---
Don’t dual wield Cruel barbs. O-hand is way too slow
---
No they don't, and no I'm not. Calm down and get back to the point of the thread.
---
Can anyone give a detailed explanation of honor? Like..
---
1.	Is there diminishing returns from killing the same player?
---
2.	How often does that reset?
---
3.	Honor trading? Is that allowed? Or is it illegal but people do it anyway?
---
4.	Same honor from a lv 48 vs lv60?
---
5.	More honor from higher ranked players?
---
6.	People talk about honor grinding, do you literally just sit in front of BRM all day?
---
7.	Camping flight paths all day will be the best?
---
Prolly a ton of stuff I’m missing.. feel free to add
---
They've already stated that now that they've laid the groundwork in Classic it would be simple for them to port over TBC as well.
---
Being edgy is rarely funny. Especially when it isn't clever.
---
What?
---
Is there any way to move Looting window (The one with Need/Greed options)? It can be really annoying with some lovers to loot during combat.
---
I should have started leveling my hunter alt earlier ;_;
---
It will be camped a lot. But you can just corpse run once or twice and they cant stop that.
---
Dude, i got it on my first run in deadmines. The entire set.
---
Obviously Padres trousers... that +42 healing massively outweighs the other stats the epics have
---
The edge, if you don't like edgy/dark humor I totally get that, but being confused that people can find it funny is naive arrogance.
---
It takes a certain mentality to /yell what you are about to do.
---
My opinion that BGs should have been out at release is very quite sound. I have a primary source if you need the reference.
---
It’s dead
---
OP sounds like a real shitbag tbh
---
The event puts them at Dire Maul, but they decided to leave and go to ZF (getting the mallet from Hinterlands first) to complete the Carrot on a Stick quest instead.
---
Gotcha.  Was just confused about the title
---
post real information then
---
I'm not talking about graphics.
---
Me not that kind of orc!
---
Yes agree (seems you are referring purely to 3rd but there is an edit clarifying it sorry), I did not know that HoJ and Chain were overlapping with tanks. I was trying to bring up the point where warrior tanks take purely dps items (which is what you are doing?).
---
Lol, your stance changes in the reply. It goes from pretty clear cut ninja when it comes to HoJ and Chain but you say there are no hard rules at the end? I'm confused. Are you saying that it's okay for rogues/warriors/hunters to roll on your dps gear but a paladin can't? So is it a class thing then?
---
Also, are you saying that it is acceptable for you to tank and roll on purely dps items like leather pieces? Because that's where I brought up the double standard.
---
Shouldn't of been racist.
---
Not in uncontested areas
---
yes, this guys "uber casual" gf should be the measurement for all future updates to come
---
That's honestly on you guys at that point lmao I would never wait that long for someone who said 2mins, at the 10min mark i'd be LFM Healer
---
I actually have what you just described and still think 11/12 is too soon. :/ Was hoping for early December, oh well....
---
pooping sounds in back ground
---
"No time for play, work work"
---
I participated in something similar in Runescape, and we competed for territory. It was fun
---
So to get honor from someone they need to con green to minimum level for a level 60 to get honor from a kill is 48. Stallag does have atrocious imbalance which will suck major ass for you guys (I'm on herod alliance and its fairly similar). So 48-60 will be rough but just dungeon level especially as a warrior if you tank it's insta groups all day. I get that feeling of being left behind sucks ass its just you aren't behind at all. Most people in actual vanilla didnt start playing till alot of the content patches were out. It's totally fine and people run all the content the entire life time of the game PVE and PVP.  
---
Basically if someone is grey they give 0 honor and if someone is interested in honor they won't be a level 60 fighting where level 30s are. Not saying there won't be people griefing low levels just that there's nothing stopping them from doing it before the honor system is out if what they want to do is grief.
---
Nazis are bad
---
yep, its gonna be fucking brutal. if blizzard is smart, phase 2 will be pretty short
---
😏
---
I think even people who got 60 fairly quickly still dont have a lot of equipment from MC. I mean the game is only out for 2 month. 
---
But maybe they wanted to push this phase, so the PvPer can start having a purpose?
---
This is the biggest issue I have. Look, if you're not 60 rn, I have some bad news. You're never going to kill Kazzak. It just won't happen. The top guild on your server has finished recruiting for it's primary raid team, and that team is going to be the one that kills him over and over again. You'll also never hit Rank 14, or likely even Rank 10, as PvP requires a significant time commitment that makes even hardcore players balk.
---
So, if you're not even going to really interact with the content of this phase, why should it be slowed down for you? It could come out this month, or the next, or a year from now, but it will always be too soon because it is pinnacle content that requires a time investment you cannot make. The argument might be better for BWL, but the counter is still that most raids take a good 5 hours to get through by an experienced group. If you're not 60 by the time BWL comes out in however many months, and you started at Classic launch, the problem isn't that Classic is moving too fast.
---
Interesting how perspectives work. I feel the exact same way about you after reading your comments in these few threads.
---
Joking! Or am I.
---
Imagine writing three whole paragraphs cuz ur mad at ppl hating on ur game,
---
They know, they will keep the BG button on the trigger finger.
---
Which guilds spend a whole night trying? I have never ever seen a guild in trade chat recruit that is not 10/10 MC.
---
Apparently all the good features that I think classic players would like are not in the feature trailer or not really detailed enough in it, such as:
---
* Adding back removed skills to provide back class identity.
---
* alt friendly expac - can start doing endgame grinds from level 1, if you got one max level character then you can even choose your endgame covenant (new endgame faction system in SL) on a level 1 alt.
---
* new roguelite mode, whereby you enter endless dungeon and each time you finish level (s) you get new skills/perks that go to following stages(s). Such as permentant fire elemental for shaman, but no more frost spells.
---
* Can decide how to level through the expacs (few options depending on alt or completely new player).
---
* level squish. **Max level will be same as classic (60).**
---
Let's be honest, he's probably so brainwashed that he had no clue and is simply parroting back whatever bullshit he read on the daily caller or some other nonsense spin site.
---
Mainly he's missing the Blessed Armor of Plot +5
---
You should look into it if you care though, the democrat's history has been bruied pretty damn thoroughly and it's all very available information if you're looking for it.
---
usually 0-1, but it seemed pretty random.
---
Diablo 4
---
people who kill lowbies for no reason are garbage
---
It's obvious to anyone who can see the pros/cons, the only reason youd take the epic is for PvP or if you're in a fight where you genuinely need more hp to survive a boss mechanic.
---
The more detailed sessions make Diablo 4 sound like an MMO Lite, shared open world. I wonder how that's going to work out.
---
It’s not LHC, it’s in the Bulwark (in Tirisfal, right before WPL). Argent officer Garush gives the quest and ends it.
---
Scepter for sure, 2% crit is really only 2% more damage unless you have some talents that rely on it.
---
Your casual ass is probably on a normal RP server so don’t worry
---
It would have been more boring with less friends and smaller view of the world :)
---
I see what you did there.
---
I just had it drop off of a Lageshi mob while farming in Azshara yesterday... sold it for a nice 612g. Got me close to my epic mount real quick
---
It was said in another panel that she got a power spike from the big baddie thing in the dead area that she is in league with.
---
You stayed inside all day playing a video game while you could have spent that time with meaningful human interaction, life goals, young love, etc. It's like saying being a peasant is the same as being a king because they will both die in the end.
---
Hey man I’ve seen you in un goro. You need to give dirtyrandy some tips on how to play mage :P
---
Informative stuff, guides? Not repeating the same dead beat 50 times a day. Be original. There have been a few original memes pop up as well, it's always refreshing.
---
There are NO weapon rewards available at all until phase 3. Honor level is capped. People are freaking out about this for no reason. Phase 2 might as well be called the phantom phase because the game will barely be noticeably different. The reactions on this subreddit are actually insane to me
---
Alliance is getting mechagnomes, horde is getting Vulperas.
---
So much salt for my breakfast egg. It's delicious.
---
you can only sheep humanoids and beasts, theres no others
---
Best addon I ever got was characternotes. I don't really believe in ignoring everyone you have a slight disagreement with in this game like a lot of others do.
---
The addon will bring up a red/yellow/green [note] next to their name depending on the bad/neutal/good experience you had with them.
---
I agree. I have engi/herb on my main and alch on an alt (he needs lvl 35 still :D). Bought als receipies I need for later ....but greater arcane elixir is.... like over 1000g every time it’s up in the ah :(
---
Well unless you have some sort of dysfunctional ass (Crohn’s, IBS) by the time you get yourself in a dungeon you should already know you have to go bad and it would’ve been polite to avoid getting in a group.
---
So I’m at a bit of a roadblock in my leveling experience. I’m a level 58 mage, and I’m an experienced AoE grinder (I grinded most of my levels with some questing in between). I already have most of my pre raid bis, but now that I’ve hit 58, I can’t seem to farm for 5 minutes without 3 horde coming and bullying me off every spot. I think i fell behind a bit and became on par with the curve, and yet nobody on the server is really running LBRS/Scholo/strat. 
---
I’ve tried to move to winterspring to quest some, but every mob is always dead/spots being camped by 60’s for Timbermaw rep. I’ve tried moving to Felwood to farm essence of water, and the pools are always camped by 4-5 horde at least. 
---
I’m so annoyed at this point, Idfk what to do! These last 2 levels seem impossible. Should I make an alt and level it up until I see someone LFM in chat? Should I try starting groups even though I have no idea what I’m doing in any dungeon except maybe BRD?
---
Here are all the swords you need for your journey, fellow Rogue:
---
* Sword of Omen (34, SM quest)
---
* Vanquisher Sword (37, RFD quest)
---
* Thrash Blade (45, Maraudon quest)
---
* Mirah's Song (58, Scholomance quest chain)
---
You can use Thrash (main) and Mirah's (off) in raids until you get your first raidblade.
---
You filmed your own computer screen... With a phone... Vertically... With Snapchat text on it...
---
I hate this generation
---
All of them.
---
As he said, lunatics
---
If you're in a casual guild like mine where a decent amount of people are doing MC for the first time, and we only get about 30 people every raid, you do go through progression. We still haven't been able to kill Ragnaros.
---
Happened to me once in SM as well :o
---
Idd, the smart move would be to ignore first! In fact if he had ignored him before he said or did anything he wouldn’t have had his moment ruined!
---
/s
---
People run alt raids too
---
Don't listen to these fools.  You can do whatever you want *as long as you disclose it*.  If you're tanking, tell them at the beginning, "Hey, I know tanks are scarce so I'm happy to tank, but I'll be rolling on tank and healing gear this run.  If that isn't okay with you, find a new tank."  Guess what, sometimes they will find a new tank.  If you create the run yourself, when a healer messages you *TELL THEM* you are going to roll on heal gear.  Given the lack of tanks in dungeons and the excess of tanks in raids, I have no problem at all with tank druids and paladins rolling on healing gear while tanking 5-mans.

Technically her power came from Kil'Jaeden. She was a Mary Sue in the TFT campaign and she remains one today. Having her pair up with Varimathras instead of entering into an unholy union with Kel'Thuzad was the worst choice the writers ever made. Instead, she just auto-wins all her fights with no sacrifice or struggle because Mary Sue.

I think i've posted on /r/politics once or twice before on a 5 year reddit account?
---
You're complaining about me carcaturizing somebody while caricaturizing me with a caricature that isn't even accurate 
---
At least try to contend with the person you're talking too.
---
My bank alts name’s are, Imabankalt/imabankalttoo
---
I agree with you.   It seems like something blizz would not be happy with.  Most events like that offer reduced or 0 xp for mobs killed.  See ZF stairs event.  I expect this to be fixed.
---
You're stacking a bunch of contentious claims on top of each other without posting a source. 
---
You realize you can't just state that something there's consensus on is false because it fits your narrative better right?
---
He seems nice. “Dumbass”
---
Lol.
---
Not sure when I last played BFA. At least half a year. Probably more like 10mo. Resubbed just for classic, havent been tempted to login at all.
---
oh... i meant that this is not my post... i do like it ;)
---
Op blocks his own name and not the person he's witch hunting LOL
---
Not to necro an old thread just have been researching, seems almost all are gone now and classic is pretty clean thank god
---
What did you do to him to make him try to ninja that?
---
Yeah it's almost like a subreddit isn't one person but a collection of people with dofferent opinions.
---
Find a group, avoid the horde, or just form a group for a dungeon. You'll want to learn other dungeons eventually anyway.
---
...but how the hell do you have pre-raid BiS before hitting 60 and w/out doing endgame dungeons besides BRD?
---
Baby we got a stew going
---
Glad to hear people have the balls to call out dirtbags.
---
Generally the jokes for Chappelle Show skits were making a commentary on society and requires a bit more depth than just making some KKK RP.
---
I've changed my keybinds a hundred times since hitting level 60. Also didn't train or use close to half my abilities until 60. This tool is super useful to someone like me, so you can stop being condescending about it when you're wrong about its usefulness.
---
And yet the KKK votes Republican now.
---
Things change.
---
There was a time that if you met another resistor in the wild, it was a wondrous thing. Things have changed here and i think it is the onslaught of mobile device users and children. The vibes changed. It was like shopping in a Target that slowly became a Walmart.
---
Once you get to level 48 you will be worth honor to level 60s who will be trying to farm honor. There are gonna be many high level players who didn't have an incentive to kill you before but now they do.
---
No im asking if getting high level engi stuff will be impossibly expensive.
---
Not slow, normal or typical.
---
&gt; watches 5 minutes of broad information for an expansion a year out, "retail is a fucking joke" "looks insanely disappointing", gets upvoted by everyone.
---
The funniest part is there's a deep dive on the expansion scheduled tomorrow, but everyone here is already condemning it before we know anything about it.  Sometimes I feel like this subs only purpose is to hate on Blizzard.
---
They go in the corner.
---
He doesn’t. You on the other hand...
---
Didn't you know? This is Reddit and we don't worry about things like paying artist and developer salaries. Overwatch 2 is just like Overwatch 1 so obviously it should be free otherwise Blizzard are confirmed nazis.
---
Grobbulus is pretty balanced :^)
---
Pucker up then to give Blizzard a big kiss because that's a typical response from them to the inevitable howls of outrage from people who don't realize what a bloodbath world PvP is going to be as people try to rank without BGs. My guess is they will come on November 26th.
---
There are three trinkets that allow you to get scourgestones by killing undead NPCs in the Plaguelands: The standard [Argent Dawn Commission](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12846/argent-dawn-commission#reward-from-q), the [Seal of the Dawn](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13209/seal-of-the-dawn#reward-from-q) and the [Rune of the Dawn](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19812/rune-of-the-dawn#reward-from-q).
---
The last two are rewards from a two quest chain. [The Flesh Does Not Lie](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=5212/the-flesh-does-not-lie) is the first part and can be accepted in Light's Hope Chapel. The follow up quest, [The Active Agent](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=5213/the-active-agent), is what u/Redorb28 was talking about.
---
u/jaunty411 was talking about a different quest, namely [Argent Dawn Commission](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=5405/argent-dawn-commission). That quest can indeed be accepted at the Bulwark and it gives the standard Argent Dawn Commission trinket as reward.
---
Just say something before you start, not in the middle of a run.
---
Engineering is a necessity, items like ice and shadow deflector, grenades, and special armor pieces like the mind control cap will make pvp a lot easier, and increase your survivability
---
Try this out in WeakAuras 2. https://wago.io/chlTNgi3I
---
Kippingthroughlife, dominator of the ill informed.
---
your stat scaling gets worse the higher you lvl (ever noticed how you seem to crit really often pre 30?)
---
This is the first wow expansion where even the cinematic left me completely lukewarm. Every other one had me at least excited, bit this one just feels like spitting in the face of the old fans by now.
---
I will play retail if they fix pruning and gcd. It really made me quit super fast in bfa
---
Still not sure what THe_DoNaLd has to do with anything? The person I was responding to brought it up out of nowhere because they are a needle-dick r/Politics clone that needs to fuck off. 
---
Why can't you fucking losers just keep your hysterical "ORANGE MAN BAD" shit in your own toxic waste dumps?
---
When honor comes out the 70 is going to hate it. They enjoyed being dominate in zones but will have to wait hours for a bg. Lulz
---
What addon does the red circles over node spawns?

My desktop works the AH drastically faster than my laptop

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-truth
---
**Half-truth**
---
A half-truth is a deceptive statement that includes some element of truth. The statement might be partly true, the statement may be totally true but only part of the whole truth, or it may use some deceptive element, such as improper punctuation, or double meaning, especially if the intent is to deceive, evade, blame or misrepresent the truth.

in p2 the higher side will dominate. forget any zona and instance entrance above lvl 50, you will be the main target for HK farm. soon it will be 10-90.
---
This is how Apexis started...
---
I dont get how calling out someone for being racist is considered hysterical but ok. Are you going to say that reporting someone for ninja looting is leftist politics?
---
just do some pvp or run mc with your guilds farm team, you'll be decently equipped in no time
---
Yikes I'm a gnome for the appearance!
---
The droprate isn't bad at dustdevil(westfall) but it spawns scatterd in the zone so you have to spend a lot time to farm a few. It easy money for the low level characters like my hunter, I can sell it on AM for 5-10 gold depend how much the price at the moment.
---
You should have no trouble finding groups. Strat is made for mages. Every time I run Live or UD we make sure to find a mage.

---
Don't worry y'all, phase 2 consists of switching people's mail around, reading newspaper without a subscription, a minimoose ripping a pizza sticker off a car, and a small dog launching a pug into space. We should be good.
---
Wont give you honor
---
Wot.   Everquest had psychologists on their team to do the same thing, and classic wow is a re-skinned Everquest, so really that part hasn't changed.
---
Some of us have jobs a friends, ya know.
---
This should totally be the banner for the sub.
---
Eww keep your onus off me
---
Which is funny because when Vanilla launched, it was the MMO to cater tocasuals lol
---
Why do you care then? Less of your afternoons wasted staring at warcraft. It's good for you no?
---
&gt;I dont get how calling out someone for being racist is considered hysterical but ok. 
---
And I don't get what The_Donald has to do with any of this. As I said to the person I was originally talking to.
---
I guess we're all having a confusing time.
---
Depends where you are at right now. I'm going to assume you are close or recently 60 and farming pre bis gear, if that is the case mp5 will be the main choice for raids or tougher/longer dungeon bosses/fights. 
---
If you are interested in doing the best choices playing a bit better than casually, as you seem to be, I would suggest you read eggregious resto shaman guide or go watch defcamp and meldoron channel.
---
https://youtu.be/TCXeaoKg8_U (resto shaman video guide very informative).
---
I personally would use the mp5 when raiding and probably the ones with the throughput for easier dungeons.
---
True, I’ve got 4 epics one crafted lol. The only epic’d our players I have seen have always been officers or GMs, funny how that works.
---
RIP ally on PVP servers
---
He's complaining about minmaxers/bissers that are "forcing" others to do that as well. For example saying you're a ninja because you needed on something that isn't bis for you, but still an upgrade.
---
That quest is for the upgraded version of the trinket. He should be able to get the regular one already...
---
What posts? What subtext?
---
if he came back instantly after being kicked, then it is clear he wasn't truly AFK and just pretended to get a free-ride. Timing is just too perfect for him to come back at that exact moment.
---
It's edgy--they are obviously trolling for humorless dolts to take it way too seriously.
---
Yikes
---
The nice thing about being outpopulated is if you're contesting a farming spot, you can just kill the other guy. The not nice thing is that its never just one guy, there's 5 of them in a farming spot that really only has enough respawns for two. Why do they do it that way? Because everywhere is overfarmed. It sucks.
---
Bgs will be crossrealm (or so I'm told). Alliance on PvE serves will be able to face off against horde on PvP servers
---
Padre’s are pre-bis for my Holy priest if that helps
---
Little instance portals
---
&gt; Feral druids isnt a meme... if you're a tank.
---
&gt; Bear druids make amazing 3rd tanks for a raid for a number of reasons. Cat Dps is not stellar however.
---
&gt; My new raid lead wants me to cat on fights we dont need the extra tank on to maximize clear speeds, and be a tank for trash and bosses where having a bear or extra tank is good. He understands cat dps is mediocre, but the overall value is bringing me for utility and primarily as an OT until a flex tank/heal becomes more important at which point I'll go HotW NS
---
Feral druid isn't a meme, period.
---
Yeah this guy is an idiot
---
These guys are legit racists who hide behind "It's a joke bro" every time you call them out. If 99% of your rumor revolves around racism...hmm...you might be racist.
---
Funky
---
Hey guys. Not sure what color shirt I should wear to work today. I have a blue, red, and killed my boss...am I going to prison?
---
Oh that makes sense lol. Never seen anything like that advertised before
---
That good place to mine thorium??
---
How so?
---
Nah man being racist is already against Blizzards ToS, so he should have been banned regardless of the politician getting involved or not.
---
The rule is no witch hunts
---
Does he tho? You get sent EVERYWHERE! Asking for help for Lakeshire. Because his bitch ass hasn’t been able to get it secured.
---
Or in this case die and learn lol
---
No you can't use Reddit posts as proof of your innocence for buying gold. You're getting banned again.
---
gz. i hate u.
---
not even sure if you are serious or memeing.
---
I like it.
---
Seems to auto down rank on bartender
---
Perfect answer have fun!
---
yeah the zones are always worth playing through to see all the amazing art but that's about it lol
---
Not buying gold a guild alt mailed it to me. So I won’t get banned right? The message he wrote was guild bank gold for devilsaur set and epic mount
---
Ok boomer.
---
Ya, the fact that the rewards (items) are a hamster wheel raining turds on you as it turns.... Never ending, never rewarding. What's the point? I personally don't give a shit about the 200th mount or playing pretty pretty dress up by doing old content.
---
So there's nothing left for me to do in retail other than trying to get achievement for edge each raid. Did it once, didn't even care aftwards and stopped. Guild "progressed" through MC and didn't kill rag till our second full week of raiding. Killing easy ass rag felt more rewarding than spending 2 months on a retail raid and finally getting cutting edge. Probably because I knew rag might drop an item I'd wear for the next two years.
---
Respec, heal &amp; roll on heal gear. 
---
Want DPS gear? respec DPS &amp; get a group as DPS &amp; roll on DPS gear.
---
MS&gt;OS
---
Not every PVP server has a faction imbalance.
---
Go look at Google for 2 seconds I'm sure you can find it, good God. If you're so uneducated about the KKK that you don't know what they did, why are you here challenging anything? You don't know what you're talking about. At the 1929 DNC convention, many attendees openly wore the outfits to the event. This isn't hidden info, also, you're trying to turn this post into political warfare against conservative thought. Get off it.
---
Here's another history hint for you (Southern. Strategy was BS, racists didn't change parties).
---
My reference to the edit was that your original post said nothing about my post history, then you edited it in later. 
---
Nobody wants your opinion about what subs you *think* are bad. It's a trash argument when you have nothing left. You're a bully who likes to defame people you don't know anything about.
---
Hate speech? It's not even speech dude it's just people trolling in a video game. This tweet is a huge nothing burger, should be treated as trolling/edgy, and just laughed off.
---
"Hate speech" -- made up mumbo jumbo used to silence people you don't like. I think you're full of hate speech against TD, so should you be banned? No, stop pushing cancel culture.
---
If you are in an elite guild in the minority faction it should be easier for you to rank up. You can always find a fight and if you have other pro players to group with you can win most of them. You can prolly get as many HKs in a 2 hour roving gank party as it takes players in the majority faction many hours of camping FPs to equal.
---
Relying on popular consensus to guide you really won't get you anywhere these days...
---
There's nothing to contend with, it's very basic information to anyone with an actual interest in politics. You all are the ones lining up to tell the world that you have no idea about American history.
---
Doesn't care enough to be informed on a basic level, does care enough to insult anyone with a differing view, nice values you got folks.
---
Looks like you're taking the ban way too seriously bro. Personally I think it's hilarious.
---
*laughs in warrior*
---
Maybe you just didn’t know that this was his 3rd alt after power leveling two 60s XD
---
Banned for edgy humour LULW
---
It's not racist. They're trolling people. You and the congressman bit, hard.
---
You can thank Onyxia for the composition, I was screen capping from where I died. =P
---
Also... that hard S key /facepalm
---
just one word: streamers
---
(from blizzard pov, obviously)
---
Racist/sexist/homophobic/bigot jokes aren't "just jokes", especially not anything of this caliber. They've never been "just jokes". They alienate people, insult people, *dehumanize* people, and normalize bigotry.
---
No, he came on Reddit and figured parroting someone else's whining with a larger number would equate to more upvotes.
---
Someday, the bully cancel culture will be turned on you and me. It needs to be stopped and called out.
---
BoPs that drop in raid can be traded up to 2 hours after they're looted as long as they aren't equipped. I believe this only applies to rare (blue) items or above.
---
Hate speech doesn't exist.
---
The entire thing is a joke. The guys name is Jesse Jackson. Seriously? 
---
"If you don't declare this as waycist it means you're waycist". Try to have a discussion without resorting to vicious attacks for starters.
---
Secondly, learn how to humor. This should be laughed at, roll eyes at, called trolling, and ignored. You're getting worked up about edgy nerds on an RP server...
---
Happy cake day!
---
Lol you're embarrassing enough for the both of us, trust me.
---
Yup, I'd LOVE, classic+. I fully expect TBC though. It's free money. Blizzards recent actions have shown it's all they fucking care about obviously. I'd be surprised if TBC didn't come with access to store mounts or something too...
---
word. i'm only level 35 on horde, so i need something drastic to get me to 60 before THE RECKONING is upon us all
---
god forbid i'm still dicking around under 60 on the 12th &lt;shudder&gt;
---
Yeah that must be packet loss I guess. Ping doesn't have to be affected by that. Do you play via Wifi?

---
The real question is.. what will go up with phase 3
---
No? If you believe that, just roll need and then give the item to the person. That increases their chances of getting it far more
---
I am so happy that i leveled engineering a week ago, now all the mats will cost much much more.
---
They say sword spec is the best. Specially if you are a human. I will definitely swap to sword spec at max level. Given that I actually get a good sword that is.
---
People have done this since launch. Its ridiculously boring
---
Don't you mean *cries*?  
---
Felstriker, Carapace, SGC, HoJ, Ironfoe and Truestrike are all pretty tough grinds :p
---
You know what's funny?
---
(Jokes)
---
I honestly thought it was a pretty decent video, until it started.
---
650g on whitemane.
---
I would really love to see Blizzard adding this feature in classic.
---
The GCD is triggered as soon as you *begin* casting a spell. For normal hardcasting frostbolts, the GCD happens while you're casting frostbolt, so it doesn't affect you at all. When you cast an instant spell, the GCD is what stops you from immediately casting another spell.
---
The damage on your frostbolt is snapshot when you finish the cast. Notice how popping AP while a frostbolt is in the air won't increase its' damage? On the other hand, if AP wears off while you've got a frostbolt in the air, that frostbolt still does increased damage.
---
Therefor, you want to hardcast as many frostbolts as possible during AP, and when the duration of AP is less than the cast time of a frostbolt, you POM another frostbolt to squeeze another buffed frostbolt out. 
---
The duration of AP is 15 secs, which with 0 latency and perfect reaction time will net you exactly 6 frostbolts (15 sec duration divided by 2.5 sec cast time). Any kind of latency or slight delay between your casts means you're only gonna get 5 frostbolts off.
---
Saving your POM for the end means you'll be able to squeeze in another frostbolt, even if there's only 0.5 seconds left of the buff. If there's &gt; 1.5 secs left, but &lt;2.5, you POM a frostbolt and spam your fire blast button.
---
Of course, this is all completely unnecessary in MC. If your guild's ability to clear MC relies on your mages min/maxing like this, then your time/effort is better spent solving other bigger issues
---
exactly ... :(
---
Nah mate I ain't getting worked up at all, it's just fucked up seeing people protect racists and then say "I'm not a racist but freeze peach!!". Yeah Blizzard is gonna use their rights to ban people they don't like, get used to it 😎
---
Lmfao what a tool
---
What would you call it when someone uses racial slurs to demean another person?
---
I'm not sure about the recommended levels (first time I went there I was already 60), but you want to do both of them and probably many many times, because they both have preraid best in slot items for Mages.
---
&gt;Go look at Google for 2 seconds I'm sure you can find it, good God. If you're so uneducated about the KKK that you don't know what they did, why are you here challenging anything? You don't know what you're talking about. At the 1929 DNC convention, many attendees openly wore the outfits to the event. This isn't hidden info, also, you're trying to turn this post into political warfare against conservative thought. Get off it.
---
If it's so easy to find then just post it. I've looked extensively and can't find a reputable source that contradicts my point. 1929 was before the realignment. Once again, this contradicts nothing that I've said. 
---
At this point reality and highschool history is political warfare against conservative thought. 
---
&gt;Here's another history hint for you (Southern. Strategy was BS, racists didn't change parties).
---
This isn't a hint, it's a claim. Grow a spine and post a source. 
---
&gt;Nobody wants your opinion about what subs you think are bad. It's a trash argument when you have nothing left. You're a bully who likes to defame people you don't know anything about.
---
It was a side point you're pivoting too because you have nothing left to grasp onto. Anybody who is not a delusional cult member understands how much of a malignant shithole The_Donald is. 
---
The places you choose to spend time in reflect a lot about your character. 
---
&gt;"Hate speech" -- made up mumbo jumbo used to silence people you don't like. I think you're full of hate speech against TD, so should you be banned? No, stop pushing cancel culture.
---
You can choose to be a TD member. You cannot choose to be black, gay, etc. That's the core distinction. 
---
Blizzard is a private platform, and as a part of their expression of speech they can choose whether or not to host certain content. It's perfectly reasonable for them to not want their platform to be used to host a virtual KKK rally.
---
I mean I don't RP as a KKK member so I'm not worried about anything lmao
---
Won't someone think of the racist trolls though 
---
:(
---
This, so much this. I "quit" at the end of TBC and came back several times. Each time getting bored of the game even more quickly than the last. I played BFA for about 3 months and I can honestly say, it's gone so far off the rails I'd never of been tempted to sub again if it wasn't for classic.

What are you referring to?
---
I guess there's a viewerbase for those kinds of videos. It's just not me.

But much like I don't watch make-up tutorials because I don't wear make-up, I'm not gonna watch dad gamer wow vids cos I don't have a kid :)
---
How hard it is to craft a new cursed weapon for the fucking lich king? His power is almost limitless. His mere presence should have given her disease and virus and plague and frost and whatever. Also where are the countless scourge units he has? Liches, necros, dks dragons, ziggurats etc? Dumb cinematic is dumb
---
You'd still get this over time while just farming..
---
&gt;Nobody's gonna want to take you to BWL in quest greens.
---
People will still run MC even in p6, for stuff like Choker of the Firelord or Band of Accuria. Also to gear up alts.
---
I don’t think 3 months to hit 60 is normal, especially for someone claiming they play 2-3 hours every night with 12 total days played. That is slow.
---
do dungeons and only dungeons. 
---
personally im going to gank everyone i see, no matter the level.
---
yes they do, maybe not recorded in the video but lot of them screw my mana with it
---
Melee behind, tank in front, you to his left
---
lol yeah then it makes sense :P
---
Maybe mr poo was half way out when he stopped tanking?
---
There's some in-character rp at pvp meetups, mostly between the leaders and officers of the guilds involved. That's just what I've seen.
---
Shadowlands looks sick. im gonna play that for sure. I dont play bfa anymore besides doing headless horseman 12 times a day. done over 1000 kills now the past 13 years and no mount. ill get that mount or die trying
---
If you know what to do yes, but for kazzak he heals when you die near him so can't really zerg.
---
Thank you for honest reply I appreciate it and will make notes to improve on next video. Me and editor were also thinking to reduce this moonfire thing but we just let it be and see how it feels later on. Also, this is phase 1, not many people pvp and there is no pvp gear or pvp trinket,so these fights happened randomly in taking over farm spots in felwood. Some fights are nothing special some fights are maybe worth to watch but I decided to make it longer . Thank you for your comment I appreciate it
---
MCing that troublesome mob with hex and hexing another one is also great.
---
Well, some of us got fucked by Blizzard allowing servers transfers on our horribly faction imbalanced server 30/70 Alliance:Horde on /r/Skeram, maybe worse.

funny :D

It's resistance set. He still needed it and would use it.

You can solo the bar for mixologists. It's your fault for having a green, not his.
---
&gt;bait out the fear immunity, then wait the 5s 
---
It\`s 15 seconds of being killed so hard that you die to death.
---
That's nice and all, but its probably just a bot that finished its lifecycle, and is now going to delete its character and make a new one in an attempt to dodge reporting. Its extremely unlikely that anyone is reading this on the other side.
---
42 is not _that_ bad because at least she’s grey to 60s.  48 however (when you become green to 60s) is when the real shitshow will begin.
---
It's not that
---
Well, you can't say that really. I can go for a shit and while shitting I get reminded that I need to load up the washing machine and dryer. I get back up and need to fix some small stuff. That's how 5min becomes 20 for most people.
---
I tried using the grid2 function "show only healers mana" but nothing changed? Do you know what could be the issue?
---
Does raid leader need to set up healer roles (kinda like a tank role) or something else?
---
Hey now, during the first few hours of classic launch, moonrise destroyed for tagging mobs. Druids were the best at that level.
---
I’ve been fishing oily black mouth since their value has increased tenfold, great money maker for a lower level like me.
---
Tier 0.5 is a catch up set with many pieces better then MC and Ony. In fact if you are a combat sword rogue 4 piece 0.5 is BIS.
---
No absolutely not.  Remember pve servers aren’t really wow - it’s a completely different game without the threat of tanking while leveling up.  People who say “i play pvp so I can experience the game without being ganked” are completely deluding themselves.  They aren’t experiencing the game at all - they’re playing a completely different game.
---
I do not. But you should probably ask in /r/wow if you want to gauge how many retailers there are around.
---
And even if you think Shadowlands looks good, at the very least wait until its launch. You do not want to pre-order wow expansions anymore. Wait and see how it goes before paying out your money.
---
Mindless self indulgence - straight to video
---
God the times..
---
If you’re in a top 5 guild you’d never have to pug anything and would just farm orbs in guild groups. You aren’t declining shit.
---
You said it yourself someone of value wouldn’t waste their time to do a favor for a pug. Exactly why tanks will pug it for an orb as they have no other reason to be there. Strat live often drops 2+ orbs, everyone else there has a chance at orbs in addition to whatever else they’re looking for. Pugs are typically there for loot/quests anyway, not orbs.
---
"rouge" Oof..
---
Mage is better purely because they can be adaptive.
---
Sure hunters are doing well right now with tribute runs but what happens later on when no one wants to buy tribute loot anymore? I play priest and made a load selling Mara runs, but now no one wants the ring as it’s no longer BiS, the farm is nothing special anymore.
---
Mages can always adapt and aoe farm various areas, other classes are only optimal during certain phases.
---
The key disapers when you reset the instance.
---
Imagine all the hundreds of people making this cinematic for years with blood sweat to fulfill some idiot narrative designer’s wet dream of her wife destroying one of the biggest most powerful entities in the world. I bet they felt dirty working on it. Literally opening up the big story book of the undead and taking a massive shit on it and that shit is basically the thing we watched. And people were actually hyped after seeing that screenshot of lich king with his burning eyes lol
---
I did the same when I was 57 on my mage. Oh boy were those 60 Priests mad...
---
&gt;whiniest casual normies
---
did you really just use that unironically
---
hey hey cutie is what jed always tells me too
---
anyone 50 and up is gonna be hunted down non stop lol. It affects them a lot.
---
That probably the point. They want us to be done with Classic by the time the new retail expansion comes out. I think they assume we'll go back to retail after "beating" Classic.
---
And they gave blizzard the idea for classic WoW. Which I'm not mad about at all. All I've been doing these past 2 months
---
From dusty tome or just a mob?
---
Jesse Jackson and Charlottesville are referenced on some level, therefor everyone involved is probably a domestic terrorist. What's not to get?
---
Man, I'm at EU RP-PVP and it all seems so boring compared to the US RP servers. Also on Alliance, and it seems like compared to the Horde there isn't a lot going on. Kind of makes me bummed to have picked it.
---
Reroll PvE or play the dominant faction on a loopsided (most of them) pvp server.
---
I have not done it
---
They want us done with Classic before the new Retail expansion comes out.
---
me as mage and the priest were preraid BiS 
---
i didnt look at the gear of the other people, we did not run into any problems tho.
---
I feel like a warlock or hunter pet could even tank some of those dungeons, u can kite most bosses forever without them ever hitting you if u really have to.
---
BuT tHe bOoMeRs MaDe HiM dO iT
---
Never heard of this in 15 years. It's news to me!
---
If anything it should be easier because Cata replaced classic zones but not Outland
---
😳😳😳😳
---
Arms
---
lol at the downvotes, yeah screw that guy for being immensely lucky to be able to get money doing what he enjoys. Yes reddit, if he works more than 10 hours a week he is absolutely wasting his life away and it isn't worth it.
---
I have almost forgotten that retail even exists
---
figure out the low time for a server and level then
---
also if u start getting camped - use gy res and go to a diff leveling zone
---
make groups and level in instances
---
if u get fed up - farm lowbie instance for gold
---
Check recipes that drop in AQ, Mats for nature resistant gear. Things can will potentially be used in AQ
---
And yet, if you level a char on a pve server you have removed most of the achievement of getting to 60.  Suggesting people should play on a pve server their first wow experience is a terrible idea.  It’s like suggesting that someone who wants to try bungie jumping should first just jump from two steps up on a staircase to “see if they like it” first.  Pve servers change the game so drastically that it becomes practically unrecognisable.
---
Did you get the quest "A call to arms: The Plaguelands" in any capital city?
---
i don't think the people playing around 2h per day are the same one than want to reach R12 in the first place
---
As a Druid I got slightly sad.... He got a freaking Aurastone. That however was replaced with a general sadness that Blizzard always favored Priest when it comes to gear
---
If he didn't want to be "mistaken" for a giant racist, maybe he shouldn't have been *acting like one*? This "just a joke" shit is just a thin facade of plausible deniability on top of actual fucking racists. People who buy it just help smokescreen them by being "false positives", though being part of that smokescreen very much seems to lead many to eventually lose the "false" part.
---
I have a bad feeling about this
---
The Great Firewall sees all, reads all.
---
Who said world pvp was meant to be fair?  War isn’t meant to be fair, very few fights, even duels, in wow are fair at all.  Someone always has more or less gear than you, plays a class that is hard counter to you etc.
---
World pvp while leveling is an obstacle that vastly improves player agency and the feeling of achievement when you overcome it either by winning a fight or by getting revenge or by dodging an area being camped etc.  Without these vast arrays of interactions and stories created by those improved interactions and agency - the game is a far more hollow and uninteresting place.
---
It's not edgy anymore.
---
People like you are why comedians are afraid to be funny now.
---
You are a professional outrage activist. Nothing will ever be good enough for weirdo censorsorship lovers like you, that’s why nobody gives a fuck about you or what you think. You are nothing and people like you are jokes. 
---
Free speech will never be defeated by over sensitive babies like you
---
An Asian?
---
Butwhy.gif
---
I hate it when Congressmen go after a whole product because people abuse the systems like this. 
---
Its not fair to Blizzard nor is it their fault because racists and trolls will do trash like this.
---
Ofc it did and it's very easy explainable - ppl that actually play the game to its fullest don't post anymore because they spend time playing.
---
You sure showed that bot who's boss.  It'll think twice before it messages you again
---
my face
---
No one ever has much gear from raids while they're current content. Unless there are only 1-2 of your class in a raid or you're the MT, very few people will actually get full T1 before launch of BWL. It was like that back then and on pservers. When there's 40 people in a raid and bosses only drop 2-3 pieces of loot on average, you usually won't finish a set until you're already in the next raid tier. It's just part of the Vanilla experience.
---
From my experience gnolls are even worse than Murlocs
---
Yep. We bored
---
Oh it's the alt right freedom of speech shit again. You can tell every joke you want, but you have to live with the consequences. He got banned, so there's that.
---
Just dunno enough in prot to get last stand and do what you wish with the rest of the points.
---
Wew lad that's a lot of anal pain
---
That was supposed to be a clan outfit? Guy looks a million times cooler than someone in a bedsheet...
---
Do you have to be a hammersmith in order to make Sulfuron Hammer or can any 300 blacksmith make it?
---
the average age of wow players was 29? where's this stat from
---
So for a while at release you could actually enable this with a cvar.  So it’s in the game and works just fine.  Then they removed it for some reason even though really no one wanted it removed.  I get it wasn’t in real vanilla but this honestly would be such an improvement that has ZERO gameplay advantage or effect since you can still get that information from addons it just looks worse in game.
---
Was literally playing classic for weeks at launch with this turned on before they nerfed it - very annoying.
---
I mean, your amount of work hours would be a bit more relevant information than your salary here.
---
I wonder how/if honor farming is gonna work on a PVE server in phase 2... maybe hang out in BRM pvp flagged and hope for the best?
---
I was healing this run last night.  The whole group was in voice chat and when he said "naughty secrets" someone in chat goes "he wants our internet history!"...  we wiped from laughing so hard, I love this game
---
I opened about 50 so far without anything :D
---
Hmm. Maybe roll on any cloth healing gear a few more times and see if we care.
---
The issue here is that this "congressman" is trying to guilt Blizzard into taking Woke action.  He got hold of a racist image that people used Blizzard's game to their own dubious desires. Blizzard isn't responsible for this behavior; but can take action as needed.
---
Not a joke, I don't remember if its #1 but they are very high on the list.
---
not a very strong magnet eh?
---
Did they fix the [Discombobulator Ray](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=4388/discombobulator-ray)? You should be able to use that to dismount people.
---
Installation and Configuration
---
Note that this is not an independent addon, it must depend on Atlas. And there is no any enhancement within this module. This module only provide the dungeon map's images for specific expansion.
---
You should have Atlas installed, and then once you have also install this module, then Atlas will be able to display relative maps while corresponding dungeon is selected.
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/atlas
---
Install that too
---
I thought we was asking if you can DE ANYTHING.
---
Tauren named Jooishbanker
---
So it does dismount people? That is the intended behavior.
---
They just want to bitch, it’s turning into the retail wow subreddit already.
---
There is no double standard, it’s pretty clear that a Rogue is going to roll on HoJ/Chain so Warrior either bites the bullet or doesn’t invite. It’s not clear that a holy paladin is going to roll on HoJ/Chain. You are killing someone MS over your OS and even if Ret is your MS by not communicating it you are deceiving.  
---
I mean it’s not hard to ask if it’s cool to roll on X item and skip all the drama.  
---
Your example is asking why Warriors can be tank and roll DPS and it’s because they are literally forced to tank for their epics. You can do the exact same thing, tank Arena runs with 3 mages and a healer and have your chain... same exact thing Warriors gotta do. Than try not to get upset when it finally drops after who knows how long and your healer grabs it.
---
Gonna have to mirror a lot of people here and say both parties are partially in the wrong on this one. Shamans can indeed tank, but they will have had to commit a lot of time and resources to that. Seems you both got a bit defensive here and I dont think either party looks that well in the end.
---
As long as you do not get mind controlled away from the dungeon, that should be a solvable problem. Might become more standard with dungeon reseting alts so you don't need to leave the dungeon to reset though.
---
I meant launch of classic, not actual vanilla
---
Wowhead and Icyveins bislists for shadow priests are both awful and missing some absolutely key items that are present in mage and lock bislists.
---
I’d say defiance is more important tbh, that extra 15% threat makes a huge difference. 
---
I went 0/31/20 with last stand, defiance, and 3/3 imp sunder 2h fury, and I could deal perfectly competitive raid dps with obsidian edged blade, and tank everything below MC.
---
Depends what the conversion rate is.
---
Also a lot of the time these accounts are ones they’ve hacked from legit players.  So the player gets their account back via blizzard because it wasn’t their fault, and the spammer moves on to another compromised account.
---
Just grinde monsters.
---
A really important part of classic is to understand that 90 percent of your xp comes from pure monster grinding.
---
Guild name checks out!
---
100%
---
People have fun with getting pre raid BIS or BIS because this element of the game has vanished for multiple years in modern WoW. Titanforging/warforging/whateverforging ruined the gearing process and targetable goals while gearing. But it's way more fun to get targeted gear than random bullcrap procs on gear.
---
Dude this addon is for saving time, I only have an hour or two max a day if I’m lucky. This kind of addon saves me so much time!
---
you don't need prot for 5 man dungeons or ubrs.
---
Well, it used to be people like joe dirt. https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=11316/joseph-dirte
---
Dungeons.   Farm dungeons as much as possible.
---
It most likly wont. Even a 40vs40 almost crashes the servers
---
This addon is for saving time, I don’t want to spend my only hour for the day grinding when I can just spend 5 mins here and there with this addon.
---
That question is just plain rude.
---
It's unacceptable if it's *message* is unacceptable. Mock social democracy, or Norway, or my clothes style, all you want. I don't agree with it, and it obviously won't make me happy, but it's not "unacceptable". Racism, bigotry and fascism, however, are what I'd consider unacceptable. And obviously, context matters, i'm not saying any joke that involves race is automatically over the line, but shit like this, without some *seriously extenuating circumstances*, is *far* over it.
---
Isn't the lack of Tactical Mastery hard to deal with ?  
---
And don't you gain that 15% threat or almost with your increased dps ?
---
I didn't defend shit. You're incapable of explaining yourself so you dismiss any quandary as alt right
---
You only need blacksmithing. Your specialty doesn't matter.
---
Mistakes that ended in retail were ensuring that the most casual players can do all the content at all times no matter how many hours they put in (except difficulty scaling like heroics/mythics ofc). This is the opposite of that.
---
They said the majority of the work was done with vanilla so rolling out tbc would be way quicker and  easier than classic was.
---
You responded to the wrong comment lol. But I agree 60 in 4 days is bullshit.
---
Yeah. Why be nasty if you can be nice? On the odd occasion, I'd whisper someone saying I like their name or a piece of their armour. :) 
---
Couple times they've said I've made their day. :D
---
As a holy pally I’m super jelly
---
To be fair... 
---
Its Bolvar Lich King. 
---
Bolvar was always kinda weakling and when he became Lich King he was basically immobile and in life support.
---
Sylvanas in other hand has always been more powerfull than people give her credit for.
---
In WC3 TFT. 
---
She almost oneshotted Arthas DK with her black arrow, while Demon Illidan lost to weakened Arthas DK.
---
In current story she has gained even more power.
---
She is basically immune to damage, can teleport / dematerializate, can wield arrows made by black magic and plague shit.
---
She could literally kill anyone on azeroth with one arrow.
---
Nor was it ever humor.
---
Sold 2x pearls yesterday on mograine for 60g each.  They’re getting kinda insane.
---
fun?
---
I'm 48. Classic levelling gets you sick of your brackets. 40-50 hasn't been too bad. 30-40 drove me mad. 20-30 made me impatient.
---
Fuck retail
---
Defend this comment. Don't make it and run away, defend it. How is this edgy humor? I will wait.
---
I would sit there the rest of the night fuck that asshole
---
Dedicated shitting streets, come one. That one should be obvious.
---
Haha if only more alliance were honorable like this. I'd love to 1 v 1 duel alliance, but they seem to only attack when your getting whooped by mobs.
---
Paying to go to blizzcon then using a chunk of that time to do something that is pointless and you could do and probably have already done at home?
---
When there’s loads of other stuff to do that you can’t play at home right now and is totally new?
---
I saw a guy with a TPB name and we exchanged quotes it was nice
---
If sword specialization from 300 to 305 equates to an extra 3% hit chance, what does bringing it up to 312 mean for your hit chance when you use edgemaster's handguards?
---
I’ve been running a 9/31/11 build for several weeks now.  With it I’ve successfully off-tanked rag/ony.
---
Advantages:
---
 - good mitigation with imp shield block and toughness
---
 - good raid dps (I am constantly up with top melee dps, but it’s obv gear dependant)
---
- keep flexibility in fights with tact mastery. Switch stances for overpower and thunderclap
---
Downsides:
---
 - Threat. It hands down sucks in 5 mans. You need to drop mitigation gear for items with crit to keep flurry up to have a chance of holding agro
---
- in raids you can only tank targets that aren’t getting dps’ed straight from pull
---
It works for me as I’m not a MT so my threat is less relevant
---
Free Action Potion breaks all cc. Lesser invisibility potion will let you dip out of a fight. Potion of Invulnerability might be useful if you're at the front of the zerg and start to get focused down because no one has the balls to charge in with you.
---
dude's accusing me of being overzealous, meanwhile the same dude spends his entire free time on the_donald. i dunno why that's irrelevant.
---
You're an idiot. The time line they released for phases ALWAYS had bgs coming after the pvp system after launch in p3, not p2 or p1
---
I feel like rogues have no room to go afk. You can find one in 3 seconds in LookingForGroup
---
Eh you are probably a deplorable racist if you believe that.
---
You could simplify your party UI a lot more, there's a lot of visual noise.
---
You're the only one who mentioned anything about free speech.
---
So how long should blizzard wait before they release phase 2?  Should they call you up and ask why your girlfriend is taking so long to level? They have the numbers. Most people are at max level and they want to provide content for them.
---
&gt;......I play on PvE servers but I'm getting jealous of players who've got a rep for ganking lowbies &gt;.&gt;
---
Awwww you know me!
---
I hate it
---
The corpses on the battlefield! This is sick!
---
Just to add my voice:
---
This is too soon.
---
Good man. Can't turn your back on those humble creatures who we call upon to ride into battle with.
---
Gear doesn’t suffer durability loss from pvp.
---
Just reroll on PvE server ! I did the mistake once on private server. I won’t do it again ... She enjoys exploring, farming/bashing, sightseeing... Not pvp
---
Which is great. I hope it is a perm ban. And I hope all of the people in here defending this shit as “just a joke” make jokes like this and get banned too. 
---
Fuck racists and their “lol just a joke” nonsense.
---
I'm only lvl 41, how much time do you think I need to lvl to 60 ? Also I think my gear is bad because I die rather easily, where can I loot better gear ? Thx guys
---
Where do you get the ol worgy porgy
---
Isn't it showing the full healing of the hot instead of the ticks? Also where can I download an up to date version of Healcomm? I want to try it again now but can't find the github page.
---
And i started this counter strike! Knifecrime (Dreadmist)
---
Yeah, I'm kind of there too. Not been into modern wow much since cataclysm, but the trailers are always tempting. This one just isn't.
---
There is nothing evocative of WoW about it, it just felt like I was watching a very well produced but ultimately generic fantasy battle scene.
---
You'll increase your hit chance some and reduce the glancing blow penalty. Check here for the formulas:
---
 [https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Hit](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Hit)
---
Should be fine. People overreact a lot imho.
---
IDK I've been in St for weeks now killed thousands of dragons and still don't have a drakestone of frozen wrath. I've seen 2 Savage glad chests and at least 3 hojs with not even close to the number of kills.
---
FAPs don’t break the cc, they just prevent new ones for 30 seconds.
---
While people are generally happy to help here, you could just find the trinket on wowhead and see the associated quests etc and check the comments section. Next time try that first as it might be quicker.
---
Azuresong
---
You sound like a fun guy!
---
Literally the reason why we oughta leave Wow and tell blizzard to fuck off.
---
Neat, I didn't know that.
---
First MC run we do. Am the GM, took a ton of work to get it together, so getting the sword, everyone saying gratz and well deserved.. I’m gonna remember that moment well. Classic ftw
---
GW GvG is still one of my favorite pvp experience, felt like a real battle
---
I feel like it's about to get way worse.
---
Chillwind point. NaCl. 
---
Maybe there's good salt nodes there
---
Don't worry. Low level low geared warriors do really well in world pvp.
---
I doubt people are seriously RPing KKK shit in WoW. I don't find it funny, but that doesn't mean it's not a joke
---
This is not true. Free Action pots makes you immune to all stuns, roots, slows, but you can't remove anything with it. It will only make you immune for its duration. You can still get feared, polymorphed, sapped, trapped.
---
Dark coffer runs for FR enchants are a tank thing.
---
How the hell do you hide? Never figured it out
---
Wait, you're having trouble with your TPS output? But isn't that the point of fury/prot in the first place, to maintain threat levels where defensive tanks fail?
---
It is quartz. To prove this, move your spellbar around. It moves with them as it is attached to it.
---
Isn't that an instant spell? the coil i mean.
---
Tukui is master race. Not using it for classic though
---
Level 40 human warrior, getting slightly bored of running dungeons over and over and I just want to mindlessly grind out some mobs solo. What is your go to mob to grind around this level? What about other level ranges?
---
Havent touched retail since cata
---
Looks like Titan Panel.
---
Not even enchanted!
---
You can do that, but it's more fun to switch zones frequently and do quests.
---
Does p2 mean I'll still be kill 3v1 by skull level ally on my lvl 20char?
---
No one is stopping you.
---
Most warriors consider ironfoe and felstriker to be a myth, dal'rends is effectively bis.
---
Chicken is more used for the  haste buff in raids and death ray is just fun I guess as it can 1 shit people, but in pvp  it’s not going to make or break you engineering is mostly used for iron grenades, nets, and spell reflection, which both specializations can use
---
Blizzard don't care. They're printing money because of these spammers. Same reason they don't punish multi boxing.
---
You're a spaz
---
Im so tired of people saying this. One guy says 44. One says 45 one says 46. Youre all talking about the halfway point of exp. Not time invested
---
Come on playing 2 hours on weekdays some game is by no means a no-lifer. Or do you call your friends who watch tv series 2 hours a day also no-lifers? It's all about time management.
---
A lot of these cowardly alt-right people will come out of the woodworks explaining that these things are "just jokes" and that they shouldn't be taken seriously - which is fine, and generally speaking I agree with this sentiment. I'm personally okay with joking about virtually anything in any way, so none of these jokes offend me.  
---
But when you ask one of these people to actually explain the joke, it becomes clear that the funny part isn't the absurdity of racism or the dark themes therein - the funny part is that other races are bad! And they will never, ever stand for their actual views.
---
An internal small indie company issue
---
Epl questing is a nightmare even now, with bored 60s constantly camping Lights Hope, so I expect it to be a LOT worse in the endgame questing zones when p2 hits. I think that most pepole will be better off finishing leveling in dungeons.
---
I have 12 days played in the character creation menu. What are you guys rushing for?
---
That’s supposed to mean he’s safe? Hah!
---
I already did. That's why im advising other people to do so.
---
Wanna make a hunters day?
---
Tell them you like their pet...
---
P.S. I like your post.
---
Do you have to do MC/Ony to get into the later Raids (BWL/AQ/Naxx)?
---
I say this to my students all the time.
---
Another trick is to sell stuff at 7pm on a Monday or Tuesday night right before most guilds raid. Prices inflate heaps at that time.
---
There will always be a gap, weather level or gear.  Someone will always be behind the curve and on the short end, blizzard can’t cater to everyone.
---
Heh, horde my PvP server have been trying to do that since launch. 
---
Seriously, you don’t see alliance in main questing areas any more... horde kill them all. My experience feels like a PvE server mostly, am never bothered cause alliance are all dead.
---
9/31/11 probably puts the one point in improved shield block for mitigation and doesn't have the points for Defiance or Improved Sunder, so the more DPS gear you drop the worse it's gonna be. If you're truly sword-and-boarding, something like 0/32/19 or a more standard prot build will probably out-threat you the more mitigation gear you put on, and wildly out-threat you when stuff starts hitting hard enough to let you dump heroic strikes.
---
The downside of 0/32/19 (what my warrior is running right now) is the lack of tactical mastery (and of course dropping 5% parry.) You can cheese it a little, but that's why so many vanilla warriors went 31/5/15; the best parts of arms combined with the best cheap parts of prot.
---
 No way
---
Lvl 42 in stranglethorn right now and won't be able to play much the next weeks.
---
Well RIP me.
---
It is all about resistance of mobs you killing
---
I assume you're being sarcastic right?
---
Context:  I was runnign around Darkshore leveling my fishing and noticed a Floating Debris pool.  Cast -&gt; Watter Too Shallow.
---
Cast -&gt; Watter Too Shallow.
---
[*screenshot*]
---
It would be nice if Blizzard could review and edit all the fishing pools with bugs.  The other notable zone that I have found with bugged pools are in Alterac Mountains on the coastline for Greater Sagefish (at least those can be fished from if you spend enough time casting).
---
but you still on a wow subreddit
---
Yep but that always goes to caster dps
---
This is actually fucking dope. I hope the reality is as cool as it looks on paper.
---
People who do this aren’t competitive.  In fact, the people who do this and flex it are almost always bad players who equate being good at the game to just doing this.  They never actually play the game besides being ahead of the auction house curve.  Being rich in this game is good for freedom from farming, but doesn’t mean shit about skill.
---
Welcome to Reddit, falcorn.
---
To retail
---
Seriously. So many haters...
---
I feel like the world is plagued with idiots so if people are being clever then I'm proud of them.
---
The world needs more clever people. Punishing them is counterproductive.
---
So why do you need to be able to bully people without consequences though?
---
True tho
---
Dragonbreath chili, although im not sure if you have to hit the enemies in melee or they just have to hit you

They always do

The United States of America have no culture so there is nothing to be ignorant of.

Ahh true. I forgot about those and was thinking about in-house washrooms for reason.
---
Idk but they'll never be able to remove layers from Faerlina.
---
If it's anywhere near as populated as Faerlina, I'd say the same thing.
---
That's definitely a fair amount of time to kick someone for.
---
At least I'm not seeing what I did in near the end of Vanilla where groups would insist on Warlocks for a summon, then spend the next 30 minutes arguing about who would help while the lock and myself waited at the entrance....
---
Too soon. I think.
---
If they like the game but hate the company, why couldn't they still keep following what's going on in the game and the subs?
---
Well I guess if we are doing a phase every 2 months, classic will only last a year. Just in time for all of us to buy Shadowlands, I guess.
---
Been to Silithus, Ungoro, or Azshara lately?
---
good for u mate :)
---
now move from my front page please, thanks! :)
---
Well that's pretty shortsighted. Just harming the efficiency of the entire guild.
---
1. Desktop most likely. 
---
2. Budget tbd
---
3. Only business in the future, low use, but necessary
---
It’s bis for holy paladins (the only paladins that matter).
---
Wrong.
---
I have engineering/tailoring as professions. I guess ZF it is for me. Thanks pal. 😊
---
"Who said a 30 year old game could not be beautifuul!?"
---
90 runs in and I still haven’t seen the main hand...
---
Unless it's like a lock. Good luck to those low levels vs one of those monsters. If you feel like you're winning it is only because they are letting you.
---
Looks good if ur 15 y/o
---
[A combination of manual censuses from 2005, also I was wrong it was 28](https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/world-of-warcraft1.htm).
---
No, but I didn't earlier, either. Been playing vanilla private servers for 5 years and would prefer to go back to that.
---
Aaaand this is where I quit the game
---
This. But also, I already unsubbed because, before they said it, I had thought about it.
---
Feel free to make yourself feel good.
---
Because it's only a bridge between no honor and battlegrounds.
---
Once battlegrounds come out this "World PvP" as people like to call ganging up on outnumbered and/or lower level players will die and people will just spend their time at BG masters waiting for their queue.
---
It's especialy bad because of population numbers on certain realms. It was already bad in vanilla and we can only imagine what it will be like with 2-4× the population.
---
It should've come out at release or patched together with battlegrounds.
---
Pvp ranks are by realm, so you should have an easier time grinding pvp ranks. (Less competition)
---
You’ll be able to play the AH better.  (Again less competition)
---
Otherwise your life is gonna suck.
---
[Here you go](https://wow.tools/maps/Azeroth/23/3/-43.118/23.451)
---
Its getting more to the point that people aren't doing 5 mans as much. At least on my server most 60s that I know are on alt
---
Because typically the tank doesn't need anything from East, so trying to find one who doesn't want the thorium is nigh-impossible.
---
TBC, as far as lore goes.
---
It feels too quickly
---
+1 for druids, once you hit lvl 20 and get cat form, it's a lot of fun.
---
Wow, no-life much? I haven't been able to get past the character select screen, I work 30 hours a day and have 48 children to take care of.
---
Human and Nelf :)
---
Yeah, I was thinking making one of those PSA threads on this, hearing and seeing so many just run around trying to find a spawn or skipped quest altogether. It literally takes only 5 mins of killings, then just head back to where you started.
---
I've was already arguing with people over this in barrens-chat - yes, raptors and plainstriders share spawns. Horrible game design btw, making non-quest mobs to share spawns with quest mobs, breaks the immersion.
---
Leave it to orthodox paladins of the Holy Light church to sniff out the gay people and Detect Undead.
---
That said... I also feel seen by that comment.
---
I always imagine it being said in a high pitched Monty Python kind of voice and it cracks me up. Like the voice of the person who says "he's not the messiah"
---
I think you attempt to do a lot of dungeons but everyone will get camped along the way and no dungeon wil be run, with the honor cap the first weeks are going to be a real pain since honor grinding is going to look like a breeze. But little do they know
---
Yeah because western storylines dont have all powerful overlords pulling the strings behind the scenes.
---
Well they could release bg:s like they released DM. As a separate thing from the phases.
---
This comment should by higher up. Bunch of chicken littles out here.
---
First raid it went to a holy pally when 6 mages and the hpally all put down maxdkp and it was a tie (new guild, first clear). Then it went to roll and pally won. Weeks later hasnt dropped again and 2 mages have been saving up for it
---
"it's humor because people don't like it"
---
Racists have some weird logic.
---
&gt;. But this was basically a 1v1 fight.
---
Which is another questionable aspect of the fight. The Lich King has a massive army and lives in a heavily guarded fortress. It should be more like 1v1000.
---
They just went with a good looking cinematic over logic or reasonable writing.
---
EU or NA?
---
Yeah either you play casual or you go balls out 18 hours a day.
---
You can't half ass it like 8 hours a day.
---
you mean GIVE IT TO ME
---
Work is da poop!
---
My guild is an alliance guild, we wanted to try Horde.
---
‘Tis but a joke.
---
Arms forever
---
I wouldn’t call myself a mega-casual, I play at least 3 hours a day. I’m only level 52. But at least I’m on a really alliance-heavy server, so I will hopefully still be able to get to 60 among the pvp.
---
Do you visit r/mordhau ? First time i saw this Copy Pasta was there.
---
You cared enough to watch the video and make a comment attempting to point out how little someone cares, who shit in your Cheerios this morning?
---
Ahh you're right, i stand corrected :)
---
So, posting racist images is fine, you just have to add a note "racism is bad", huh? Do you apply the same logic to child porn I wonder?
---
As a newbie I need a list of acronyms and their meanings. Lol. What is LOS?
---
Automod has blocked your post. Something has triggered it.
---
You have no idea what dark humor even is. Hint: Dressing up as as KKK member isn't.
---
Also: "Edgy" humor is stuff for preteens. If you want to describe yourself with that same adjective, be my guest, but also realize that this means you're just a stupid motherfucker on the mental level of 10 year old kids.
---
That's probably because people ran three mage priest warrior plvl groups though. I mean my guild had a full raid for MC week 2 that was nothing but mages priests and warriors.
---
Correct. It's mostly for Gnomish Battle Chicken and Gnomish Death Ray. Then drop, learn and Goblin!
---
I fail to see how it's fun
---
Also feral is pretty good, while boomkin is subpar so thats why its so rare.
---
For bear tank i would keep using Archaedic stone. Both the bear BiS rings are from quests so I would make sure youve started those quest chains as you get to 60. Rings: thralls resolve, ring of protection
---
No one is gatekeeping anything.  I'm simply pointing out that pve servers are a completely different game - not "the same game without ganking".  This is simple fact.
---
Thanks. Is it worth to to pay a 60 warrior or Paladin 3-5 gold or so to get me in the backdoor for a quick knockout? I don't like ulda but I want to finish that mage quest.
---
Actually that was a TBC thing, just looked into it. Where judging seal of justice would cap their movement speed at 100%. I think you just gotta HOJ and pray they die in it lol.
---
Great, I'm glad for you.  This has nothing to do with what I was saying.
---
Not sure what they're referring to but I've noticed a number of warriors are extremely pushy and bad to group with because they act like the run is only for them. But that's just some, overall I've had very good experiences on grob
---
hi. I'm a hunter and the blade of eternal darkness dropped. I was wondering if it proc'd on arcane shot or serpent sting.
---
I was just there, grinded them for about 4-5 hours super late at night and then at 5am all of a sudden 3-4 people show up at the same time to grind them sadly.
---
Yeah because the exp is the constant. The amount of exp to get to 60 doesnt change. So obviously its going to be used as the reference. People arent going to say "Oh you have 10 days played, youre halfway to 60!". Time invested doesnt equal experience.
---
No, not since the last time I dealt with 10-year olds. "Edgy" humor is just a different way of saying "stupid, completely fucking dumb humor used by people with the mental capacity of a 10 year old."
---
I play a Warlock. I'm new to the game, never played before classic. What is wpl?
---
Lmao the irony
---
What's the best pvp server on oceanic for alliance?
---
Line of Sight
---
You're gonna kill a bunch of them, so preferably something with a reputation gain. Like some mobs in Western Plague Lands for the argent dawn rep.
---
Imagine having so little virtue that you think calling out racism is, and can only be, self righteousness XD
---
Ah cool I'll check that out.
---
The you move on to the ghosts just outside karazhan.
---
Western plaguelands
---
I've noticed this on my hunter too. My crit rate seems to go up and down randomly even if I haven't levelled up. No gear change no buffs. It can vary by up to 0.7%
---
Was waiting for you to throw it at the wall! Really cool though.
---
Cats are popular because of higher dps and they eat fish which is convenient if you are also leveling fishing/cooking. Boars are also popular because of dash ability and because they eat everything. Check out Petopia for pet information, a google search will bring it up.
---
Just for leveling though. Regardless at about 55 or whatever I'm going resto. Feral is kinda boring to me but if it's really that inefficient to go balance then I won't
---
Any mobs in mind? I'm looking for a spot with enough to have no down time, but when I went to Western Plague Lands earlier it seemed like all the mobs had nasty debuffs they put on me
---
This. You just talk to him and complete the quest (which is instant) which gives you the Trinket.
---
NA
---
Even as a healer you can walk people through dungeons or carry them. If theyre that awful and refuse to play better after a wipe or two you can tell them it ain’t happening.
---
Healers aren’t irreplaceable so they can get someone else to carry them. 
---
I’ve only bailed on 3-4 pugs but even still 2 of those were guilds where I was the only pug and they just had no concept of how to manage a higher level dungeon. This is comin from someone exalted with argent dawn.
---
I usually help hordies that leave me alone. Tends to keep things friendly when we are in the same zone for periods of time
---
Ah, the meme of calling everything that you disagree with a meme.
---
Loyalty and Liberty. I keep mentioning it because I really hope people recognize the intention behind those names
---
The only bafoon I see is you
---
#tipsfedora
---
Lmfao this made my morning thank you
---
Most of the PvP servers are practically empty PvE servers at this point due to the ratios on them anyways. If fp camping is going to make you quit and you haven’t already, you’re probably on the big faction anyways and don’t need to worry.
---
&gt;Says the Mage.. :D
---
It's true tho...
---
They are for me!
---
No, because RP is weird
---
Personally Stranglethorn Vale, animals drop valuable vendor trash and meat you could sell on the ah
---
Warlock is just great with alchemy. Potion + healthstone gives you so much HP if you need it. Having a steady supply of health pots feels like a bigger advantage in 1v1 scenarios than engineering. If you're a horde warlock 1v1 can be a bit boring though. You can easily kite wars + paladins easily (well wars if you initiated from 25yds+ away since your dots have 36 yd range). You destroy mages, druids and priests. Leaving only rogues that are hard to deal with (though you can beat them especially if you're an orc and stun resist). 
---
I feel like alliance lock is at a much bigger disadvantage since shamans are much harder to deal with than paladins.
---
But why dont the gnomes just ride the eagles to Black Rock?
---
This is what the sub needs. Less bitching, more memes.
---
Just a reminder: the BadBoys add-on is available for Classic.
---
the screenshot or the guy i was replying to?
---
That warrior protecting his stoop. Respect

What Class are you?
---
Depends on whether or not the firewall acts as a proxy for the decryption keys.
---
"HEY EVERYONE, COME GIVE ME SOME ATTENTION!"
---
Missread ur post.  To be clear -it does not dismount in classic
---
I heard that 40 is about halfway to 60 timewise
---
Why do you know what Grindr chat looks like? :O :P
---
&gt;5L QotF as 6L in POE.
---
What does that even mean?
---
Reminds me of Dennis in 'dee has a heart attack'
---
I loooved dead baby jokes when I was about 13, they were hilarious. Now that I'm an adult and understand how absolutely awful it is for people to experience miscarriages or a baby dying and I just can't see it as funny anymore. I wouldn't judge someone for making a joke, generally, but where and how you deliver it really matters
---
Teens lack empathy because they're right in the middle of when it starts developing. Adults are supposed to have learned it
---
Idk, I feel like most people in classic are pretty helpful and forthcoming. Moreover, there are many new players as well. When you feeling insecure and doing a dungeon for the first time, just let your group know. Most of them will be happy to help and give tips. And when some people don't wanna put up with inexperienced players, so be it. There's always enough groups available that are happy to help and share their experience with you.
---
It more the overreaction to something done in a fantasy world. It's a joke, and your moral postulating is the punchline.
---
I kind of doubt this is the only place in your life where anxiety is causing issues from your description. Same way to deal with this, desensitization by gradual introduction.
---
Maybe try partial pugs to get a bit of confidence?
---
Not only what the first guy said but usually it will be 5 toons, all the same class, one will lead and the other four will follow the first so it’ll be one toon, (usually a mage or lock, lets be real) with four standing all in the exact same spot behind the first following and mimicking all attacks/actions
---
Your group frames are way too big, that's basically all that makes this UI bad, everything else is fine. Everything is way too big and you certainly don't need your party's portraits.
---
But what did they carve into their pumpkins???
---
Yeah literally never did that.
---
They actually said that other expansions would be easy to do because they essentially took the bfa engine and rolled it back through each expac to get to the classic state. So they really just need to bug test bc.
---
What's this?
---
I get the same thing while trying to level enchanting on my alt. I have a ton of mats and offer free enchants to the party. They never believe it's free.
---
Go to the karazhan entrance. They will find you. Also there are 2 cellars you can grind in, choose the one closest to the entrence
---
OH MY GOD. This guy has a macro when he lands off of a fuckin' flight, like a gryphon, he yells: "Hello everyone, I am here" and uhhh cause I've seen him do this like four times.
---
And then he greets everyone warmly oh my god.
---
You should've seen me first week in. Someone did the ony q in SW where they have a battle.
---
I RP'd the shit out of it for fun lol.
---
The guys who were doing the q just stood and watched as I attacked all these elite dragons at level 30 yelling shit like "for the king!" 
---
One of then was a priest and I died like 3 times. Each time "/1 YOU THERE, %t SAVE ME FROM THESE FOUL BEASTS!"
---
lol imagine if your argument is to watch a person who's generally considered to be a shitbag outside of young teenager circles
---
You can't fury tank without a considerable amount of gear and it's really only somethin hardcore guilds do.
---
Sounds like plain old rl social anxiety to me. Not sure what can be done about it except keep putting yourself into those uncomfortable situations until they become mundane.
---
I don’t understand why have an opposite faction of you can’t kill them or be killed on sight. It’s awesome and adds a level of excitement or dread.
---
Thanks, i appreciate it.
---
Because I’m fucking gay
---
When random people whisper me and say they like my name, it really does feel good. Maybe because I’ve always been indecisive about names and I finally came up with my “own” name that I enjoy, but nonetheless it’s just a wholesome moment amidst a sea of “LFG everything res” “crafter LFW crafting everything” “LF1M MC PUG Need Shaman Please We Beg You” etc.
---
Probably lit
---
Multi-boxing isn't against the rules.
---
HoJ hast turned into a mount rarity for me. Same with Dal Rends Swords, I’ve never even seen one and I’m at 22 UBRS runs. Killed angerforge a lot but never got my hoj.
---
Yeah, guess that proves they did speed up their original timetable for DM release and didn't have time to come up with a new (actual) preview in time for BlizzCon.
---
But Waaahhhhhhh
---
My buddy got Savage gladiator chain the first time I did arena with him. I've seen 2 HoJs on &lt; 10 angerforge kills. 
---
I'm a healer though.. so of course I've seen 1 Reed on over 20 Jed's at this point. Fuck this item.
---
So in other words, the firewall sees plain text.
---
I don’t play horde so I didn’t even consider shaman lol oops good point
---
Unless I'm misunderstanding you, retails gear progression is anything but linear. It's actually a complicated nightmare for a multitude of reasons and junk items exist in the most frustrating of ways.
---
Thats amusing.
---
No
---
Oh no what an asshole
---
No, just the initial cast.
---
Get "showmyheal" or something I always hate if I can't see it
---
They are not following schedule from vanilla ,not even close.Things are rushed for sure,many people expected honor in December not now already ! At least they should have announced it month in advance. 
---
Many people are not ready just yet ,and its gonna put strain on them if they wanna do it all .They are not streamers whos job is WoW so they can just play it and sleep until they finish all the current content
---
oh yes for sure. My alt Shannarah and my SO's alt Wokeoak get comments all the time and it feels so nice. I especially like when his gets the compliments because he was so unsure about the name and then *immediately* got compliments and he gets all bashful. It's so cute
---
I dunno man. Sounds like a pretty interesting event to happen. It's not like his hurting anyone. And if you don't like him just ignore him
---
Dude. Its bolvar King. A lich King without frostmourne. He has almost no power. And arthas lich king wasnt strong in lore either. He was strong because of cunning and army size.
---
Do you even lore?
---
Drakestone is like way rarer and more time consuming to get than those, even the most hardcore neet guilds don't expect you to get it.
---
but... boars only give 2 experience points a piece
---
That is how i leveled through STV, never been ganked once

I wish they would release BC without flying mounts.  Any place that requires flying to get there  just add a flight path.
---
No waaaaaaaaay. Is that in BB, you’re fucking with me right?
---
I use rhe gnomish boots but they always ran out of power after like 4 seconds while it's written 20 secs.

Ik they can fail but is the success rate that low ? Or do I have to do something else ?
---
Is it racist to just like assume theyre Chinese?
---
does that count for blackmouth oil though? Right now those are selling at about 50 silver and I'm pretty sure normal established rates would be closer to a gold.
---
Can you hit 60 by the 11th? If not, stay where you are. PvP servers will be miserable for those 48+. Unless you like dungeon spamming.
---
i dun leik it so itsa bad writing babyrage babyscreams
---
Seriously, can Blizzard stop these guys though
---
Someone whispered me:
---
":("
---
" 2/15/5"
---
When I said I didn't understand they never whispered back. As a new player I am scratching my head trying to figure out if this means anything relating to WoW or if it is just something random.
---
Sting
---
Can confirm. This happened to me once, my account got a ban and I had to contact Blizz.
---
When I got back in my main had been deleted and I had a few new Lv1s with gibberish names on random servers I'd never played on.

Do Mithrill spurs require the character having them to have Blacksmithing to use it?  Or is it a perk for BS's?
---
I've never played retail, there are modern MMOs like that though.
---
It was more of a general comment.
---
I loved grinding the Skullsplitter tribes in Stranglethorn. They are plentiful, nicely spaced, and they drop some great loot.
---
It took you less than an hour to capitalize on your lack of brain cells and setup your strawman argument. Impressive
---
Just go out and play. All this time you spend practicing this mini game is time you can spend farming while also practicing muscle memory.
---
Risky behavior brought on by toxoplasmosis.
---
Looks like its A build, the 2,15,5... Maybe its the current build you have ATM? Find that Unlikely though because you'd need a certain Addon for that person too see yours.
---
But 2/15/5 is f definitely a stat build. 2 points in first tree, 15 in second, and 5 in 3rd. Feel like it was A miss tell

I don’t recommend switching often, whenever you switch you have to rebuild those loyalty points which can slow you down

Your skills/talents or whatever. My priest is holy disc and shadow so im like whatever into holy, whatever into disc and none into shadow. So it would look like 20/15/0, if you use details addon people can inspect your skills

---
Are you sure about that? 
---
I can't buy things from myself even if I have 2 different chars to put it up and buy it out? 
---
Cause that would mean that what u/_shinyZE suggested wouldn't work after all and I'd waste a lot of time running to booty bay.
---
I say boar. Pet pathing is so buggy that half the time the mob gets to me and my pet hasn’t even attacked yet.  The charge helps with it a bit.
---
Considering the gear level of DPS directly correlates to how quickly the raid is able to take out obstacles such as bosses and trash I'd say they're directly improving the efficiency of the entire guild by prioritizing that item to DPS.
---
/readycheck
---
10/10
---
Just make sure that whatever you do, you are still able to tank the add in the encounters your raid requires you to. They clearly need you to be able to do that in order for them to be able to kill those bosses, and consequently any bosses after those you listed.
---
It may feel like you're dead weight on the other fights, but remember that you are filling a crucial role and if you change specs and are no longer able to fill that role then you are likely to upset your raid group, not to mention potentially costing yourself loot opportunities.
---
Horde send it through Ragefire Chasm.

Yes, in vanilla they have no requirements.

If you just want the Shoulders, look for "Coffer Runs".

Yeah so far on our war+druid combo we've done everything prior to rfd. Last pull killed us in that one and I didn't want to bother with another try since I needed to go bed.

The Halloween buff near Undercity, 25% stamina basically.

Find a good guild man! It’ll help, trust.
---
Nah never too late. But! With the PvP honor system coming out soon, most players will be on their mains and the lower levels will be a little more vacant imo. 
---
Don't want to deal with getting ganked definitely roll a PVE server.
---
I remember one guy in EPL whispering  me that i got a cool character name i still remember it even months after and prolly wont forget
---
I love Benediction.
---
Kromcrush!
---
Was in the same position and thought switching to full heals would help and it didn’t. Since i didn’t want to lose out on pre raid bis and still level up, i ran quests in Felwood, winterspring,wpl, and epl quests with dungeons in between.
---
Unfortunately that is the type of community being fostered in a lot of game subs. Yesterday in this one there was some guy using the term "frens," in normal conversation.
---
Some of the people who fell into this behavior have isolated themselves with others who believe the same garbage and now it's impossible for them to keep their BS under control because they just assume everyone feels the same way. You can see examples of this in this very topic and comment chain.
---
No, reputation means something, and is likely close to the source of the anxiety. 
---
OP: cultivate a “fuck it, I’m just gonna try” attitude. Be upfront; tell folks you’re not an experienced healer. Remember: rude pug dps can die if the group doesn’t wipe!
---
Also in this exact same boat. Really just want to switch my character to a pve server.
---
This is what Peak Male Performance looks like.

Dishonorable kills are for killing civilian NPCs, not low level players.

I was kidding matey. No need to get all mad and shit.

Thanks.

---
I think it'll eventually be possible, once blizzard opens up paid character transfers.  It may be possible now, if your realm is full you may be able to transfer to a PvE server (you're given the option to transfer characters while in queue to log on).  I'm not sure about that though.
---
As on orc Bone slicing hatchet is a good shout, same goes for Iceblade hacker the 1-5 bonis frost damage makes it do a lot of damage:)
---
You’ve just gotten lucky then. Bc you have a mana bar you are eligible for the attack - only a matter of time
---
Same boat as you. It does seem little 2 hours a day. But a baby, gf, family. Yeah shit eats up time.
---
I'm doing runs in 10-12 minutes by skipping the last boss so it's certainly possible. 
---
DME solo is 100+ g/h
---
On mobile right now so can't check, but from the description it sounds like a basic version. I'll try it tonight when I get home! Fingers crossed since this seems like it might be the only way lol
---
It’s always the same. An alliance member get gready and kills a horde to steal a mob. Horde retaliates in masses and the farmable spot is no longer farmable for any other alliance doing it.
---
I don’t get mad at horde for killing me while farming, I get mad at the idiot alliance player that decided that stealing a kill was worth ruining the entire farm for everybody else.
---
The irony of an American accusing other cultures of being ignorant is just far too ironic to not laugh

Ah! Thank you! That must be what it is. And it probably was a mt because that is not my build.  ^^
---
Because they don’t want to get attached to their crappy pet when they are going to get a better one in the not too distant future.
---
Under the OP post there is an option to change the sort type, if you have RES you can make that the default option so your threads are always sorted like that
---
Haven't played retail in a long time, but that cinematic has me excited for the release. Definitely going to give it a try. I'll be the decider if it's fun for me or not.
---
He won't lol. Alt righters are the biggest cowards. Even when they have their idiot in the Whitehouse they still refuse to say what we know they wanna say, on a God damn wow forum lol. Pussies
---
I guarantee you there was no reroll for the greeders. 
---
If you roll greed on a 500+g item then you never deserved to be able to sell it.
---
It's pretty much just natural selection.
---
Seriously don't roll anything but need on big ticket items. You will end up posting a screenshot on reddit and whining while someone makes off with hundreds of gold.
---
Gnomes eat it
---
So your argument boils down to "it happens here too, so let's just ignore the problem"
---
Eastern Plague Lands, top left corner by Stratholme. Lots of mobs, not a lot of quests related to the area. AD rep for kills.
---
when the same paladin from my guild who took my judgement headpiece from onyxia also gets my reed
---
Thank you.  I believe it is talent related and they were meaning to whisper top someone else.
---
Which is why Holy Paladins have complained so much through WoW's history that they're not allowed to bid on it.
---
However, there are two issues that results in the "Mages/Warlocks first" rule:  
---
1. Paladin gearing isn't particularly important. The reason Paladins are brought on raids is their buffs. They really don't do much in terms of healing, dps or tanking that others can't do better. As a result, gearing your Paladin tends to be lowest valued use of any particular gear except for Paladin-specific gear (or gear that is effectively Paladin-specific such as caster shields).  
---
2. The Mageblade is a significantly better upgrade for dps casters than Paladins. DPS casters are likely to be getting +20 to +25 spellpower over the item they have. In contrast, Paladins only get another +9 healing. Indeed, you'll generally see that healers are sent to the back of the line for any item that is +spellpower rather than +healing due to this fact - even if that item is technically BiS for them.
---
&gt;Paying to go to blizzcon then using a chunk of that time to do something that is pointless and you could do and probably have already done at home?
---
I think that's part of the joke here that you're missing out on. The big thing at blizzcon for this was supposed to be running through DM. 
---
Each and every one of us can already do that since they rushed the release of it.
---
It used to not be a 50/50 drop between that and the leaf. So it was pretty rare
---
Once you hit lvl 40 quests, you'll start getting 1-2g per quest and it just gets better from there. I didn't get my first Mount till lvl 45 and I needed more than 90g so I wasn't broke for Skill Upgrades when I needed them more than the Mount.
---
50%/50%
---
Sometimes when you clear the mobs around a herb/vain/chest and someone else appears and loots it, is kinda lame.
---
Man...
---
Race is in reference to physical characteristics. Ethnicity is in regards to cultural factors like nationality and ancestry. 
---
For instance, I am white but ethnically Jewish.
---
Is anyone else hating getting a Runecloth Glove and Bag pattern? I refuse to pay 30g for a fucking 1.3g vendor item. Ive sat there for hours multiple times and all ive seen is the health enchant for chest that no one freakin wants. 
---
Im getting burnt out competing with what i feel are bots for the runecloth pattern. I woke up at 1am, managed to snag the health chest enchant, cool. I guess. Noticed why the three people were leaving it, costs more in vendor than ah for whatever fucking reason even tho its random spawn. Anways, sit for another half hour, nothing, sit for another half hour, nothing. Other horde leaves and its me and ally. Hour goes by and i didnt see a single fucking thing spawn. So guys got a macro just sitting there auto looking for the patterns and buying it. Google it and "thats just the way its done, competition bro". TF is this nonsense. And then to top off the whole fucking back wall is a safespot. So you got horde/ally 60s just fucking everyone over and holding it down..i freakin hate this i just want to make own bags..
---
Hey wait a minute, you're not tradebat.
---
Always buddy, always. I can't buff it? It gets a pat.
---
Yeah I never really understood the appeal. At least something like Pax has loads of variety.
---
we spec frost because Baron Geddon and Ragnaros are immune to fire damage. BWL also has bosses that are either immune or highly resistant to fire damage
---
not really, there are a fuck load of lvl 60s on populated servers.
---
we are like 2 almost 3 months into classic. if someones not 60 by now, its no ones fault but there own. in 2-3 months you can play 1-3 hours a day, without rushing and make it to 60, have cleared MC+ony and have near full pre bis.
---
someone whose "uber casual" like the OPs GF. wouldnt be prepared even in 6 months
---
I am almost done downloading the game, I switched to a 56k modem for that old school experience.  Why you rushing?  The download screen has been amazing!
---
Like what can you even do at 60 if you can not even play 1-2 hours a day? Some dungeon runs take longer than that if you include searching for the group, traveling to the dungeon and clearing it.
---
There are a lot of games for casuals, classic isn't one of them for sure.
---
You'd think so, but the guild I'm in has an age floor of 40+, and the RL and GM got into a pissing match in MC last night that ended with the RL gquitting, the GM throwing a tantrum and then quitting, and roughly 75% of the raid-ready 60s leaving to start a "hardcore raiding guild" with the old RL. In that order.
---
GM and RL are both at least in their late 40s.
---
Kinda. I guess I’m going slowly cause I don’t do a lot of dungeons, mostly open world quests and grinding with a partner.
---
Yep of course. But the issue now is that most warrior tanks do not clear it with the group. It's a given that they will roll on pure dps gear as mentioned by several people in this thread (and the subreddit in general).
---
Azuregos gives you a debuff you have to wait out (5mins?) otherwise you die again if you go near him, so yes they both have zerg prevention
---
&gt;A lot of these cowardly alt-right people will come out of the woodworks explaining that these things are "just jokes" and that they shouldn't be taken seriously - which is fine, and generally speaking I agree with this sentiment. 
---
So we're clear then not everyone who says these kinds of things are alt right?

That would be december.
---
Yes because Zul'Farrak is way better than BlizzCon...
---
how can i see more informations about my character?
---
things like crit chance, or spell damage.
---
have any addon that show me it?
---
Classic is clearly not for you. You will accomplish nothing at 60. Most content there takes longer than you have to play each day. Honestly do yourself a favor and search yourself another game.
---
You spoke it. You are no longer allowed to do this jump.
---
Oh yea that's true. So long ago.
---
Did he roll later, in the raid? Did he roll well? Telling half a story here!
---
No, didnt you just hear the man?  Now live and feel the way he told you to because otherwise you are wrong /s
---
Really tired of these over dramatic comments like “spitting in my face” simply because you personally don’t like what they did.
---
Hello darkness my old friend

Hey, congrats fellow Pyrewood resident!

If you haven't gotten +55 Healing on it yet, I'll do it for cheap. With love, Devlan of &lt;Bastion&gt;

---
If you didn't do this, and you missed the boat...
---
Justice.
---
Yep that’s how it is the more lower lvls you have in your group the more xp your alt gets 
---
Boosting my alt in SM:Arms atm kill the dungeon in one pull really good xp
---
Wait, best weapon until Nef for Paladins or Casters? Because both apply.
---
Only if she has a bad time with it.
---
Try to make a game out of it. Bet some gold on how many times you will get ganked that day/session and then whoever gets closer wins.
---
Then come save her from ganks when her guess of 12 was under the mark
---
Haha, I did tell say it was the consensus that warrior tanks will roll on purely dps gear. So a harsh MS &gt; OS defined by current roles is against that.
---
No healer needed for me
---
I mean, I know several people who are already raid logging @5k+ raw gold and enough mats stored for months and months(logging in for MC 1 hour a week, our clears are low 40 minutes, along with a quick grab of DM:T buffs) and have been for weeks.
---
Classic isn't even **that much** of a time sink (in the modern era with how optimized the game has become), and these people still can't do it.
---
And if you're a "leveling is the main content!" and "i don't want to use guides/addons", then guess what? You're making a conscious choice to prioritize the non-60 content...so why do you expect to be waited for for the 60 content? It's so selfish, man.
---
DAE ROLL FOR GEAR?!?
---
That's not even remotely what you said. It's directly above my comment, you said it less than 3 hours ago.
---
Don't you mock my beloved Prydaz!
---
You want the Chity Beans with that?
---
All pet DPS is normalized.
---
Cats are popular because of attack speed that slows down casters in PvP.
---
Looks like Honour's back on the system, boys!
---
The dm priest quest item and the dm:w trinket which looks like a battery are both superior options for priests.
---
My favourite setting to find out when I body pulled something by accident :)
---
Shadowlands Confirmed.
---
Nah he said it because we both want the painweaver band but it didn't drop.
---
What addon gives you the flashing chat tab?
---
Healing yourself generates some AOE aggro but probably not enough to cover more than a few pulses of magma totem.  
---
A kind druid could just give you thorns before you start, 10 minute duration. 
---
Otherwise there are a few rare items (Nagelring for example) that will do some aoe damage but that probably won't be enough to do it. 
---
EZ-throw dynamite is probably your answer.  Engi consumable, does a modestly low amount of aoe
---
&gt; woke up this morning
---
Got yourself a gun
---
They have to rush things a bit this time. In Vanilla back then Honor system came 4-5 months after release. Nowadays people know all the content, all the dungeons, all the best talents, all the bis items. People are WAAAAY faster through the game. You won't get the same patch cycle as you got back in the days. That would be a stupid thing to do.
---
And Classic is also not made for casuals to be up to date with current content. It's rather egocentric to expect them to hold content back because *you* aren't there yet.
---
Can you explain this to me?  You go gnome first for the trinkets and then go goblin for sapper charge etc right?   If my buddy is gnomish can he just make me trinkets or are they bop?
---
Gl with this and no space to move
---
I get this reference
---
Sadly Retail outside the big cities is like a wasteland :(
---
Ring of Spell Power.  I’m sure there are other items that haven’t dropped, but I’m a Mage and I either notice “mage gear or not”
---
If I weren't out of town I woulda been doing the same this week... oh well
---
&gt; phase 2 in a week and a half? dang
---
gotta cash in as much $ as possible...  Phase 2 is too goddamn soon.
---
You'll see people try this but I'd just remove them and find someone else personally.
---
ExtendedCharacterStats does this for you
---
Idk man, I've seen everyone use triggered.
---
Yea, title is misleading
---
Thrall’s resolve is horde only I believe.  Do you know how I should make the decisions on which rings to keep?  Black stone ring shows up on feral tank lists as well.
---
This.. cats technically do more DMG, but while leveling low levels this + their charge ability you can get at lvl10 makes this hands down THE leveling pet for hunters imho. You don't 5hink about it, but hunters go through alot of food, being able to use everything helps alot. I bought a full stack or food when I started at level 10 with him and I think I've used 5 in the last 10 levels since then.
---
isnt judgement alliance favored ?
---
If Night Elf, must do backflip.
---
Half the reason I'm horde on pve server is cus shorter battleground qs. Well with this cross realm it'll not be the csse
---
You mean besides where you said leveling on a pvp server is more rewarding and I countered you?
---
I guess yeah if you ignore that then I was totally out of left field.
---
I just made a Warrior alt... I have so many consumables. Like 20 slots. When I want to have extra bag space.
---
Mfw "solo" doesn't include fully BUFFED.
---
Honestly the RP part of a RPPvP server is completely optional. Unless you go looking for it you wouldn't even know it's an RP realm. There is no way to enforce RP so it's really just an honor rule. When you see it don't be a dick and try to ruin it. And if someone interacts with you you don't have to RP, though I think you'd be missing the point of rolling on the server if you didn't.
---
People are also really understanding if you are new to RP. Just ask questions and over time you'll start to understand some of the lingo. First tip, anything in parenthesis is meant to be (OOC/Out of Character) so you know the difference between the player saying something and acting out the character.
---
&gt;frens
---
Lol wait thats alt-right speak? Im pretty sure the vast majority of people that use that think its just some meme version of friends
---
Your mount/food/water icons do this.
---
Crystal is nature damage, and the lashers are immune. Hopefully save someone some time
---
Blizzard is rushing things.
---
I look forward to leveling a few alts to 48 during phase 2, parking them in org, and waiting for phase 3 to complete their leveling process in BGs.
---
I didn't do dungeos, besides maybe 3 or 4 odds and ends for quests. Also if you want to be quick, a guide becomes invaluable once multiple quests have you running back and forth across the world. But I get not wanting to use a guide and experience it all for yourself. Goodluck on your leveling!
---
Edit: is your name purposely close to Kaladin Stormblessed, or just a happy coincidence?
---
What do you mean finally? My server is layered and farming anything in the open world is literally impossible
---
Talk to me when you need to grind for Dal Rends mainhand
---
Its not natural selection, its just people being selfish assholes.
---
Personally yes I think it's toofast,but they have also stated for a while that they wanted phase 1 to be short compared to all other phases. Though we will have to see with phase 3.
---
So we skew the content release as well?
---
 I’m not saying it has to wait for 100% of the player base to be level 60... but at least a little bit more than what there is now. The content being pushed isn’t even that big of a deal for me, but some people jumped in to classic anticipating a slow burn and being able to take their time, like the first time. No the content doesn’t have to be pushed at my rate, but I also don’t want the entire player base to have “been there done that” by the time I’m 60, too.
---
Any terms set at the beginning are fine if everyone agrees, but this does sound a bit greedy considering others have to pay for water/good (if no mage), reagents, some repairs, etc.
---
If I'm grinding mount money, I'd find another group. If not, I'd be fine it.
---
No you cant unless you're a tank, or know a group already and they funnel you every drop.
---
Give me my fucking carapace
---
r/classicheyigot
---
He is literally a dwarf warrior yo
---
I mean, yeah. It's not as simple as "someone says x means they're alt right", but there are certain words and mannerisms that are unmistakeable. Usually, just asking them to share their honest views on immigration or jews is enough.
---
Yes.
---
All these "just try the quiet hours" posts come up, and they aren't written by anyone on my server. Despite being a low volume server some people are starting to call 'dead', there are 5-6 people camped at Qia 24x7.
---
I farmed Winterspring for icecap for a few days and consistently called in checking for these sales and it was always the same story. I'm on a PvE server so the safespot isn't an issue.. people just leave an alt at the vendor permanently.
---
cringe boomers can't handle the bants
---
Nope. You're pretty much screwed on that front.
---
Best comment yet.
---
How does ranking work in the first weeks? You can only go up on rank at a time and you're competing against the rest of your faction on your server? So what percentage of players get rank 1 the first week? If I don't plan on grinding pvp the first week should I just avoid pvp?
---
Hello,
---
Does anyone know some good mobs to farm in Silverpine Forest to level from 15-17?
---
Thanks!
---
ty o/
---
RFD last boss can be pretty difficult without high DPS because of the adds. :/ Also the spell damage bypassing armor is rough.
---
I don’t get it... is this some reference to something or an attempt at a troll?
---
Armor, Stamina, Damage vary very slightly depending on the pet although this was “normalized” later in Retail.
---
I imagine it speaks volumes about their real lives.
---
Why do you have both Cure Poison and Abolish Poison on your bar?
---
 So far as I know there is literally zero reason to ever cast Cure Poison after you get Abolish. They both have the same mana cost, and Abolish Poison removes multiple poisons while Cure only removes one.
---
18.9%
---
The reason they're taking so long is because I am not buffing myself, not consecrating. I have no mana and no cooldowns, usually I have a trinket to get mobs off me when I'm mining this was kind of just a rush to the node because I just got a small one and realize a rich was in my view.
---
So Blizzard is literally catering to its player base rather than having a timeline of their own? 
---
Hmm sounds familiar...
---
Guilds will always be recruiting new people, and there will be more casual guilds which won't necessarily be doing Naxx and AQ even if they're out.
---
This exactly. Everyone thinks they are in APES these days.
---
All bubbles are on cooldown, legit everything I have is on cooldown in this clip and I'm low on resources.
---
Well said, they’re so blinded by entitlement they can’t see they’re being ridiculously selfish.
---
There are no "even to slightly alliance" servers to my knowledge. It's some degree of significantly horde favoured, or very alliance favoured.
---
I've never heard a single mention of a server that fits OP's criteria.
---
&gt; They're moving too fast tbh. 
---
If they keep going this fast I will bail after Christmas. I payed for a classic experience and not a speed running trough all the expansions...
---
Your loot council seems shit. Or you could play tank or offtank :) 12 epics so far
---
If your goal is exp then interacting in anyway with gank sqauds is pointless, just go somewhere that's less known and harder to get to. Putting together a leveling group just means they will be able to camp 5 of you in the same space rather than 1 or 2
---
Lazy, immoral parents who think the same way.
---
Combine that with surrounding himself with copies of himself, he'll never learn better.
---
Yep. In hindsight, it's good to mention it when the group forms. I have a feeling that since the majority of the playerbase are warriors, they want to maintain their special tank rolls on purely dps gear status without needing to disclose. Suddenly, if the discussion includes other tanks rolling for their endgame roles as well, people are going to look at warriors with more scrutiny.
---
It's a lot faster when I don't have to desperately heal myself as my mana regens.
---
You asked race. The race is flamewalker. The type is humanoid.
---
ok cringe boomer

Im in a guild and I’m one of the higher level people. I dont think you guys understand how many players arent high level yet. There are lots of people who dont have time to commit to wow and just pick it up once in awhile, noobies who dont know how to level quick, and people who havent committed to one character and tried out a couple different characters.
---
Yeah but i like being done in under 20 mins.
---
Harmless trolling. Just a general reference to the idea of alliance winning being a rare thing on pvp servers.
---
I make no claim that's skill related, although APES definitely count as the big exception.
---
Yeah I logged in at WS so I didn't have my PVP gear. I just swap the shoulders and breastplate for valor and I get the 4 piece that way. Much better for mining. This time tho I didn't want to go to the bank.
---
You really dont need to know everything, I reccomend having a level 5 alt which your main mails everything to. Download an AH addons and then sell everything on AH.
---
Went from 30g to 800g after buying epic mount this way.
---
I used to do that with bags, I stopped when people would literally wait 3 seconds, and then start /yell selling it for 2x the auction house price.
---
&gt; stuff required new engines. They had to build a new game hence why they are having people pay for it. 
---
I'm sure that happened.
---
Na, I keep deleting and remaking characters, indecisiveness is a bitch and I want my first 60 to be one of the names I choose at launch, I could use the undelete function and bring back one of the higher level guys but I think I have a week wait before I can
---
I'm still slightly traumatized by the time one of the massive packs before Bael somehow all charged out of a wall when we were right before the bridge before Incendius. I don't know how they got in the wall, or what they were doing there, but now I'm always a little afraid of getting another pack that seemingly comes out of the nether.
---
(This was in addition to the pack that is right before the bridge there, so there were ALOT of enemies)
---
This makes me feel a bit better to hear. 
---
Everyone’s attitude is very gate keeping, “you can’t play this game because you didn’t ruin your life getting to 60 in one week”
---
People really need to understand the difference between making an edgy joke and going out of your way to defend an edgy joke.
---
cringe zoomer thinks walmart brand edgy bs is interesting banter
---
Addicting for two completely different reasons. 
---
Activision-Blizzard is now chasing after the ever so important DAU / WAU / MAU metrics (daily active, weekly active, monthly active user). They have offices full of human psychologists who’ve been studying gamer behavior for decades, and they know what opens the wallets.
---
What’s being done to retail is the “optimization” of what money it can make vs what resources it costs to develop. This is why we have all this time gated content. Activision doesn’t care if you’re playing 12 hours a day, or that the game is fun. They care that you log on a bit today, a bit next week, and next month. They want you to be predictable, and they want you to open your wallet when you want to go outside of the predictability (aka, game store, cosmetics). 
---
The original WoW was created by a group of developers that wanted to create a fun game that people enjoy and continue to pay for. It was addicting because love was put into it. 
---
I don’t work in the gaming industry, but do do software dev for a startup so I have experience with this “do what’s best vs do what will make shareholders the most money” dilemma. It’s a sucky position to be in.
---
What are you talking about? WotlK lore was classic WC3 litch king stuff.
---
It's not that easy either, especially if you aren't at range.
---
Zandalar Tribe rppvp
---
I'd go for pre-raid for most raid fights, unless the fights are rly long. For dungeons, the mp5 from the epic can be nice for shorter mana breaks :)
---
Car form. VROOM VROOM!!!
---
Skill knows no allegiance. But uncoordinated pvp is by far the most dominant right now, which heavily favours numbers.
---
P2 will change things up.
---
Reed is super easy. Its a 30% drop that about 3 people want in your group. So in about 10 runs you are very likely to have it.
---
Whatever you choose, every ten levels or so put your pet in the stable and go tame a pet with higher ranks of claw, bite, dash, etc so you can teach it to your main pet.
---
Mindtap talisman is junk though. On an average MC fight it's worth a whopping 150 mana. Whereas a burst of knowledge could theoretically save you 600 mana with additional spellpower to boot
---
Honestly, why? I also play fmage but didn't even attempt the grind on those items, they're not needed to raid at all, there are plenty of good substitutes.
---
Ditch them.. this is retail thinking and saying yes just promotes them to think this is okay. You may have to wait so to find a new tank again, but in the long run it'll be better for everyone if they don't go along with it
---
Yeah I know, typo. Unfortunately I can’t edit the title :/
---
To my eyes ganking was already happening at a high rate. This may not change low level ganking much at all
---
You keep doing the same thing and misinterpreting what I am saying. If you want to feel morally superior go for it but I've told you the reasons why people would find this silly and you can either agree with it or not.
---
It's (capital G) Gamers in general, they're mostly garbage people.
---
Pallies shoudnt get mageblade because healing is so unneeded during phase 1.  Whoever has put in the most time as a lock or mage should get it.  Once 3 or 4 blades have gone out, then pallies can enter the discussion.
---
Oh lawd she comin
---
[This](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.usatoday.com/amp/489713001) might have something to do with it. It looks like this game has always attracted those kinds of people.
---
Don’t let them use the scarcity of tanks and healers to their advantage. Tanks and healers can’t clear dungeons without dps, don’t let them act like you need them more than they need you.
---
Did you ever get this solved?
---
I'm trying to create a very similar macro myself, that will cast viper sting on my mouseover (or default to target if no mouseover exists), but will cast serpent sting under the same conditions if I hold down Shift. Here's what it looks like:
---
    #showtooltip
---
    /cast [@mouseover,exists]Viper Sting;Viper Sting
---
    /cast [modifier:shift,@mouseover,exists]Serpent Sting;[mod:shift]Serpent Sting
---
However, it's not working. I can't get the Serpent Sting section to function and haven't figured out how to solve it yet.
---
What's your's look like?
---
It's cool xD I got a laugh out of it. Actually made me think of mechagnome druids lol mechanical forms like car form for cat and maybe bulldozer for bear or something xD
---
Yeah I've thoroughly enjoyed that as well
---
150-200 imho, if you absolutely HAVE to pay for it.
---
I got mine through a 7 man run.
---
I read the first pom as porn, and was like " damn, hes really optimized..."
---
xD
---
10/10 shitpost
---
Just go heal. Don’t have to type, prolly a value issue? Won’t measure up? Fear of mistakes or misplays by you and getting judged for it? Who cares it’s a 15yr old game. Play how you want and enjoy it. 
---
Next time you see an ad LFhealer for a dungeon you need. Jump on it, perform well and move on ;)
---
I wonder if the other 511 diary entries exist as objects you can find in the game.
---
want to point out this... isn't roleplay. horrigan and the enclave's only goal is to be as nasty as possible. even if you look at the page horrigan wrote for his [''character''](https://grobbulus.fandom.com/wiki/Horrigan), it's pretty much just written to make fun of roleplayers.

THAT SAID, what a nasty piece of shit. and now he's banned. we did it!

I love having locks in the party, but i'm a Shaman tank.
---
They're joking around.
---
Don't worry about it.
---
He’s bad obviously
---
Dominos can move it (you can turn off the other options), as can the XLoot [update](https://willitclassic.com/view/o2rhVeooa5MKChCVD1RW) on github, though XLoot will also change the look.
---
\&gt;Not just autowalking down the pier
---
Do you even multi-task?
---
Or a tank. I don't see many warlocks in these mage times, but man,  they're all fucking terrible and a pain in the ass. Insta-Hellfire and then are shocked when the 4 elites bash their dumb faces in.
---
Given the context of the post it is painfully obvious that I meant he shouldn't be harassed for leaving. 
---
Do I need to explain context to you? Should I hold your hand?
---
The world is dead if there's no danger.
---
CoWaRdLy AlT-rIgHt. Nice insult. Let's go ahead and get triggered from some idiots on a video game and give them the spotlight for their racism on Reddit and Twitter. Sit back and be happy that you anonymously reported them.
---
Wut, if you do it in a 10 or even 5 man group it takes like a minute to find Jed each time. All 10 goes in in separate instances, uses ornate spyglass on the door that leads to UBRS and does /tar jed. If he's in that instance you'll target him, if he's not you just go out and reset.
---
In either case it appears not to be as bad as I thought it would be across all the servers. Expected more of a player influx but it seems to have been a population decline. Phase 2 and 3 will be interesting in that regard.
---
Exactly this.  Especially as a parent. I knew this going in. We will never be close to the top but what is still happening at our levels still very fun.
---
&gt;620 km away
---
Gotta be next level ugly to have your search radius set that far
---
The screenshot. The names. The congressman's tweet. This thread. Literally everything about the whole situation is hilarious.
---
Easy! Be an orc then dal tends is not bis :p
---
I love it that not all classes/specs have interrupts and ccs. Looks like your just going to have to deal with only being able to tank, dps, and heal. ;)
---
Really not a bad idea.  Probably 9 years too late.
---
Great, thx.
---
PARKOUR
---
yea it's pretty fucking absurd lol
---
Disagree but alright
---
I had a more difficult time finding groups for all dungeons past BRD until I hit 60.  Basically every dungeon that is higher level than ST, people want the groups filled with 60's only.  So you've got 2 choices.  1- make your own groups.  2 - level to 60.
---
are there any informations about the respawntime of the worldbosses?
---
Geez lol
---
I can agree there, but I won't pay for it. Blizzard art is absolutely fantastic.
---
I've always been a gamer. Overall WOW is far less toxic than a lot of other games I have played such as LoL. 
---
That said, I haven't encountered the homophobic things in those other games that I have heard out of people that play WoW. Most of which are grown ass adults. It's very confusing and alarming.
---
Oh, and buff
---
Quests are like guided grinding, just do those.
---
I mean conversely you can argue that the one person acting differently from the other 3/4 is being naieve.
---
At a certain point altruism just becomes self deprivation.
---
How in the fuck is this retail thinking? Nothing like this ever happens in retail, literally ever.
---
Go druid! you can do it all... except no one is doing the instance you want to do.
---
I've done it as a hunter who's excited for pvp and is not an alchemist, but cheers for your pretentious postulate!
---
&gt; Unfortunately, I think you are in the minority. There are a lot of guilds already at the point of logging in for raids only.
---
the rest of the server does not have to suffer consequences for actions they alone committed. They could go out or get a life or a job? Its not our fault they play this game 24/7 lol.
---
This is some special ED shit
---
Well now it’s gonna be much harder if he is getting camped.
---
Actually Bloodfang is slightly Alliance favored
---
Bright and early for the daily races..
---
I've played on a retail RP-PVP server since vanilla.  90% of the people never participate in RP of any kind.  You get weirded out sometimes when you see people RPing in /say until you remember you're on an RP server.  
---
Biggest difference is you get get less funny/sarcastic names as they often get reported and name changed.
---
There are communities that take RP to varying levels of seriousness however.  I've seen guilds that enforce in-character chat for guild chat, and I've seen guilds that enforce rules about people remaining in-character at ALL times.
---
Bruh.
---
I can hear the boat saying "You could not live with your own failure. Where did that bring you? Back to me."
---
Which is exactly what happens on my druid! Also I have a hard time tanking on druid and I always end up being tank. I think my gear just stinks because I have no idea what I should be going after.
---
&gt;  There is currently no point in pvp aside from trying to piss off the other faction. 
---
Yes that's called pvp.
---
I get that, but to throw out that their "this" without knowing their views is ignorant.
---
Druids have many options which other classes do not have. They can basically do everything but are the master of none.
---
This is the beauty of classic, druids don't have an interrupt. But think about a rogue, when a rogue gets frozen, he is stuck. Druids can shift out. Druids can charge, rogues cannot. Druids have travel form to close gaps.
---
If you disagree with my description of Retail vs Classic there’s no hope in even talking about it. You clearly misunderstand the two games. 
---
I don’t mind the downvotes from the no-timers getting upset that they no longer have the free time to play to the end game without taking 2 years lol. Which honestly is fine. 
---
There are many different speeds of players. Those of us at the forefront still have the time and dedication to push the end. Those at the back have tons of similar players that will reach the end with them to play that content at that time. What bothers me is when those at the back are trying to bottleneck those at the front because they don’t have the same availability.
---
Healing evolved.
---
DPS brain cells declined.
---
 #nochanges
---
The whole reason they never set a date for the phase releases was to observe the playerbase and adjust the timeline accordingly.
---
I have a couple of higher level quests, but to be honest I just fancied doing some mindless farming for a bit! 😃
---
Fuck off. Your "screwed" because you can't extort people.... Lmao.
---
Ahhhhhh ughhhhhhh!!!!
---
Druids can interrupt but not in cat form ;)
---
Well that's less nice :(
---
They might not be, absolutely, but I've been in these kinds of guilds or communities and in some places, it runs rampant.
---
Hey all! My first edited video let me know if you have any tips for me as a warlock and editing! will be greatly appreciated. \*\*Disclaimer Yes Gnomes were hurt in the making of this video\*\*
---
A few notable plays not mentioned in video listed below: 
---
0:18 - Good'ol Bait and switch with felhunter 
---
1:09 - Use shadow ward to negate the 2 corruption and use spell stone when my shadow ward was down as well catch the end of spell lock. 
---
1:30 - Tried to bait his devouring magic with a siphon life first.  
---
1:34 - Devour magic to snuff out Detect Invisibility, I didn't have devour on rocket helm right away but I wasn't too worried bcuz I knew if he would cast shadow bolt or soul fire I would be able to devour mid cast and use cloaking device for invisibility  
---
1:38 - Spell lock his banish at last second to recuperate my devour magic 
---
1:49 - Death coil resisted on his banish cast (unfortunate but what can you do against an SL warlock)  
---
2:02 - My Spell lock was still on CD so I had WOTF to grenade his shadow bolt 
---
2:14 - It showed that the gnome popped some kind of speed potion but it might be a addon bug 
---
2:15 - Perfect Shadow ward to counter balance his shadow burn the gnome tries to devour it 2 seconds later.  I didnt have much gear in this video vs the T1 warlock  who used 4 Soul shards 
---
2:37 - Trying to snuff out his shadow ward 
---
2:39 - Fake cast a immolate into a spell lock batched with a deathcoil 
---
3:00 - Pre-popping WOTF 
---
3:11 - Timed with  Goblin Sapper for his demise.  The sound track (We have a containment breach "We lost em")  
---
3:44 - Shadow bolt hits for 137? 
---
3:45 - Gnome reflects the death coil but ofc it resists
---
3:54 - Spell lock resist 
---
4:16 - not sure how he caught up to me so fast without using a potion 
---
4:39 - Rogue eats gnome...  
---

Stalagg PVP - US Server Classic WOW
---
I got hit for 2-3k leveling in ungoro 
---
I still lived
---
Believing something doesn't make it true, sorry you're uneducated.
---
I'm not sure how this would qualify Blizzard as "greedy."   I'm not saying that they aren't greedy (micro transactions in retail), I just don't see how rushing content can be considered greedy.
---
It's actually pretty uncommon to see Jed/Rend runs on my new server. Most people in my guild are doing full runs and he's only up like 75% of the time. 
---
Would love to get into some solid Jed/Rend only runs and do like 20 in a weekend but they're just not there hah.
---
No it is not. It'll actually make you worse than standard fury spec with tactical mastery.
---
I know all this. But I know also that interrupt cast was implemented in WOW but not in WOW classic.
---
They're all in game. But with high populations and "relatively fast" respawn rares only popping up every 6 hours it's common to basically never see them. Particularly if you're playing in primetime.
---
I was playing stupid oclock in Barrens and saw Swiftmane for example.
---
On the north in the farm zombie drop wool iirc. Maybe not 17 tho
---
Oh I’m gonna play the shit out of it
---
It’s this little thing called having a guild, and friends to play with. I won’t go to pvp zones without backup, but I’ll just have backup every day. Login, join the roving pvp squad, go fight.
---
I don’t see anything toxic about the game having actual wpvp with rewards. This happened during vanilla too, pvp without BGs, and it certainly wasn’t the death of the game.  If anything, it will be a golden age of wow pvp. Shadowlands... probably not. They didn’t even mention pvp at the announcement. 
---
Since the nature of p2 was clear before launch, none of this is new information, so you probably should have just **rolled on a pve realm** or not played classic wow at all in the first place if wpvp was a dealbreaker for you.
---
OH FUCK YES, WELCOME TO THE THUNDERDOME BITCHES
---
Guys I do not for one second condone any form of ninja looting regardless of him being tank.
---
However as a tank let me assure you us asking for reserve on orbs or even a flat fee for a run once we are fully geared really isn’t unreasonable is it? 
---
If I don’t need anything from a run and you need a tank, I’m willing to make the run happen for someone. Why would you not be willing to make it worth my time in some way or another?
---
52 is fine for arena.
---
You probably got banned for something else.
---
I dont believe this was a bannable offense, you said nothing wrong. I would appeal to customer service
---
Imagine being this out of touch. (Then again, 99% of US politicians are)
---
"How this can exist in one of your games / will remedy this immedeately" is typical old-people talk of people who don't know how games work. Blizzard didn't make this situation themselves nor could they prevent it. Sure these people can be banned but acting like it's preventable just shows stupidity and ignorance.
---
Especially when aquementas is 1 literal spell power worse that also effects your fire spells. Drake stone is a total waste of time.
---
if TBC and WoTLK are to follow there's literally no reason to ever log back into Retail
---
I'm gay, lonely, and already have my Briarwood Reed, hit me up dudes lol
---
Are you kidding? I used to see this kinda stuff all the time before the LFG/LFR tool came out. People charging gold to less fortunate players to do runs of stuff, so they could feel as special as accomplished players with their gear! 
---
You play the game.. their are in-game costs for everything! Higher repair bills if you dungeon or raid, hunters pet food/arrows, spell reagent costs, etc.. I had an ud tank alt I did aq forward on, and I mained a pally tank from LK on (and still have though I don't play).. I have never once charged a group for tanking or required someone to pay my bills, and besides guild raids when learning new content, I wouldn't take any either. It's about community, your not running a business.
---
Well, you can keep believing that.
---
Just wait until you need something from LBRS.
---
You know all the mud huts?... Yeah... Its not all mud...
---
But there was a tank, tho
---
Do you need to have it explained to you how making a comment can be interpreted any way? Just because you interpreted it one way doesn’t mean everyone did. Also you seem to think you’re the only one right here when clearly people thought you were going the other way with it. Maybe you don’t understand how text on a wall works. We can’t read your thoughts especially when most people would think the opposite.
---
Fair enough! Well, I'm no expert on Silverpine, but try looking for humans. Those will drop cloth which can be sold or used for tailoring, and if they're also *wearing* cloth, they will be fast to kill.
---
what you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.
---
Forreal though, not sure what game you're playing but my experience has been nothing of the sort. It sounds to me you're joining guilds full of edgy teenagers. To imply that as soon as you hop into classic you're exposed to a barrage of homophobic slurs and "actions"(whatever that means), really to me sounds like a load of shit.
---
Hahahaha!
---
Wait, why are the lvl 60's naked? I mean I like it, but I'm confused..
---
Vanish cloak and net too
---
From lvl 30 to 60 it’ll only take 65340285 boat kills...get to grinding
---
That’s really clean even for today?
---
I am a lock. Have been since vanilla. I have noticed a lot of hate for locks in classic. I understand healers don’t need the mana drain of a lock life tapping till almost death as the tank chain pulls. That’s rude on the locks part. I have been in runs where the healer was full mana and kept the rest of the group completely healed and I had to eat, bandage and health stone the whole run because I didn’t even get a renew.  I am happy with a renew once in awhile. They say to life drain. That is good in a pinch but the mana it takes to use it defeats the purpose of life tapping to gain mana. Don’t hate the whole class because of some that like to stress the healer. Some know how to play some dont
---
Pet families still gave modifiers. Cats have a +10% damage modifier while other pets like Boars and Turtled have a -10% damage modifier. 
---
A cat would do 110 dps where a boar would do 90. Cats are the single highest DPS pets.
---
I'm talking wow classic specifically. Maybe it's just because people are socializing and talking to one another more? 
---
I was just under the assumption folks had grown up and dropped certain words from their vernacular and stopped calling things "gay" or making jokes insinuating that being homosexual is in some way bad. 
---
Since I've been playing classic wow and using discord to talk to people I see it all if the time.
---
I'm standing in the middle of New Orleans if you want me to send you some photos of all the non culture I'm looking at.
---
Did you see the [Preach Rap](https://youtu.be/KhI6rI1pSnE?t=702) that someone linked to a few days ago from a clip of Preach (a well known high end raider that makes videos and streams)?
---
He gives a spiel about gearing and how things work in retail, and it sounds ridiculous when laid out... but it’s true. IMO it isn’t really as complicated when you actually deal with it and look at it yourself.
---
But you do have to use a 3rd party system to sim your gear to actually find out what’s an upgrade. Unless the upgrade is insanely massive, there’s literally no way a human can math out which piece of two of similar item level is stronger. You need programs that run 10s of thousands of iterations to figure out which is better on average (procs and stuff can swing your dps by large amount between pulls).
---
One guy DCd, a Hunter in a group with three casters. 
---
Beauteous.
---
Should have been racist¿?
---
So your running a business, not playing for fun...
---
Edgy humor is still humor whether you like a joke or not. If someone finds it funny, then it fits the definition of a joke. I never claimed that edgelords were the golden standard of comedy.
---
some people dont give a rats ass about "prebis" fwiw
---
For Warlocks: is curse of exhaustion really worth taking? I've seen builds that say to take it but I just have a hard time imagining the benefit.
---
Gotta hit 10 mins for that potential ad money.
---
Lol well several of my guildies and I have solo’d groups of 3 or more. Numbers don’t always beat skill. I’m serious when I say some of my guildies have competed in arenas at BlizzCon. Some of us can hold our own.
---
Great, sounds like the Dalaran Wizards would be a good choice. Thanks for your help 😃
---
It inspires more people to be nice. 
---
Why are you so angry about that? How on earth is this a bad thing?
---
Boar for decent leveling pet that eats anything. 
---
Owl/Bat for tanky pet that can get the most aggro and take the least damage via Screech. 
---
Cat for the highest damaging pet.
---
Glhf :)
---
Does stoneclaw not work? I gave up trying to farm those packs tbh, I'd rather just do jump runs.
---
That said have you considered low level engineering bombs, or [crystal charge](https://classicdb.ch/?item=11566)? Shield spikes also seem relevant.
---
You can't get honor from gray lvl players, this actually will give you a dishonorable kill.
---
Well duh. Why on earth are you staying in a ML group?
---
Of Free time? Favorite in 16 hours of sleep and work I think.
---
0_0
---
Don't put up with that nonsense.
---
The world we live in..... how dare they not jump the pole.
---
Had a group yesterday where the tank was adamant we shouldn't have 3 rogues as dps. No reason for this when asked for specifics, just said it was bad. None of the rogues needed drops from the dungeon so wouldn't be arguing over loot.
---
  
---
Ended up convincing tank to try the run anyway. "Ok but get ready for this and don't say I didn't warn you"
---
No wipes, no issues. Still no idea what he didnt like thr idea of
---
What’s the best way to get from 260-300 in blacksmithing. Any plans I can pickup that could help use less thorium?
---
They're awesome.  
---
I think the point is that every awesome experience doesn't have to be shared on social media.
---
and who's going to kill npcs? :p
---
And then you hit 60 and there is 0 purpose to anything you did or will do. Pve servers are so boring lol, how one would voluntarily roll for it boggles the mind
---
I honestly thought most PC's were a lot more, that makes me feel better as I can definitely afford a decent one that hopefully will last a long time
---
10 days played is not average unless you've never done it  before.
---
Well either you are bad at dpsing in sub or everyone else is at combat but I've got the meters showing it
---
Invisible ghosts.
---
:tips fedora: see ya around kiddo
---
I'm ready for the real STVietnam to begin
---
Have a warlock cast sense invisible on you
---
Alright, but you don't really matter in the grand scheme of things. I'm sure there are also amazeballs horde like that, but when we're talking faction balancing what matters is the unwashed masses. Not the glistening elite.
---
That's a yikes from me dog.
---
The human warrior is named jessejackson. That's his name. He is just a human warrior trying to level up, leave him alone. He isn't even aware of anything outside of the worldofwarcraft, it's not his fault
---
Thats the boat i'm in. I'm not even close to 60. I'm Just saying playing 8 hours a day still gets you somewhere. Somewhere way ahead of casual players no?
---
Haha! Hey GAMER!
---
Did you remember to rise your dangler this morning?
---
My grandma plays world of Warcraft! Not everyone is a GAMER like you in the target demographic!
---
Good luck out there and remember kids, buy mountain dew!
---
I get what you’re doing here but I don’t think it has the intended effect. Actually, I’m reminded of the guy in South Park who killed everyone in make love, not warcraft. Anyone can camp lowbies... takes 0 skill. Honestly, it just makes everyone think you’re so bad you can only kill people 12 levels lower than you.
---
Yup. It's a level 70 spell, Skull Bash, and it was added in version 5.0.4, according to Wowhead. So it'll be added after three Classic expansions have passed.
---
You know your flair is alliance warlock right
---
If you do it and don't need anything from the run then I think it's fair to pay a fee. But if you not fully geared tanking and needing a drop from that dungeon w/e then I think it's the most fair to all to just roll greed on the trash.
---
I got a msg saying i got banned for this post , and they posted what i said in the email.
---
They even changed F them to Forget them on my post.
---
Smiled with the risin sun
---
how far over your head is this concept? Not everyone learns the same as you? yeesh
---
You say that as if there is some obvious joke. I don't see any humor at all. Exactly what is funny about the image of black men kneeling in front of a Klan member? Outrage seems the appropriate response to me.
---
xd
---
Prydaz was the neck. You're thinking of Sephuz.
---
Yeah im trying to contact the blizzard support but i dont believe they will do anythign for it :x i had bad memories contacting them back in cata lol
---
They’re fucking sad bastards who probably feel maligned by the world. Social misfits.
---
You Think many have pre BiS already?
---
there is no hard pve content out right now, its all about killing the bosses asap, so boosting the dps is by far the most efficient way, especially when it comes to mageblade and paladin.
---
mageblade is still a far bigger upgrade for a mage/warlock than it is for paladin, because their dungeon options are so far worse than what a paladin can get
---
You've got to hate the moral posturing these cunt congressmen do though. This tweet like blizzard should be ashamed that a small handful of people role played the kkk on a server. 
---
Huge difference between pointing out the obvious(the humor borders on inappropriate and is understandably controversial), vs pretending that the existence of these players is in any way at all something blizzard should be ashamed of.
---
I've tried both gear sets through 2-hour MC clears and 20-man Onyxias, and I vastly prefer the 7/8 T1 setup. 
---
With the max bonus healing setup I have to drink way too damn often between packs in MC, I occasionally get gibbed by unavoidable damage like Shazz nova because my health pool is garbage, I slowly get lower on mana through Ony phase 2 instead of regenning for phase 3 . . . all for what, going from 410 to 520 bonus healing? It's absolutely not worth it, and my opinion is that a lot of folks have been mislead into thinking it's the only number that matters and are hurting their raids as a result.
---
I'm still downloading, calm down
---
Time to prowl around everywhere in cat form until I get caught up. Check mate.
---
Racism is against ToS. Black people play games too you know
---
Healers taking Reed from dps classes are bad players
---
Then you quite literally don’t socialize, don’t have hobby’s, and don’t have a life.
---
To hit 60  in a month with a speedy 6 days/played you played 5 hours a day on average after working 9-5.
---
That means you came home and gamed from 5-10pm.
---
That’s simply suicide fuel for me, and your point is moot.
---
me too bud
---
that's where i farmed 3/4 of these
---
What are you talking about? Of course Blizzard can do something about it. The guy has been banned.
---
 Why did it take congressional intervention to stomp a known cockroach? That's the problem. Blizzard has really cheaped out on Classic and that's helping racism fester. They should have hired more community managers to watch out for this sort of thing.
---
Wow. I remember simulators from when I last played in 2010 but isn’t that really only for min max raiders?
---
Oh, i played PvP sever in original. Got really tired of being camped, taunted, chased, and ridiculed while simply trying to quest.
---
Yay, you killed me. So now I have to stop playing the game because Ill get ganked everytime I respawn for 3 hours? Whoopie, so exciting. I guess its my fault for being a Holy spec priest. I should have known better than to exist near twink geared rogues. :/
---
Cant you use both?
---
I used Thrash Blade Mainhand and Assassination Blade offhand on my Fury Warrior
---
They could just download a wallpaper with the same message though
---
cute, but borderline low-effort
---
Yeah that's how should be for the vast majority IMO.  I was just trying to point out that there definitely is a middle ground. You don't have to play 2 hours a day or 12 hhours. 5-8 gets you pretty far
---
It’s not mocking that situation.  It’s celebrating it.  “Humor” is just a guise to be openly racist.
---
That's Healium (or a predecessor of it)
---
Please don't use it it's literally just worse mouseover macros or healbot equivalents
---
Highest roll!
---
Most people will be assuming that you have played for years, but I don-t think it's too late. My friend who never played wow before started in classic and loves it.  I play on a rp pvp server (I'm not into rp myself) and it seems to me that players on my server are more friendly than on some other pvp servers so that might be something for you to consider. If not, try to Google for a server with a somewhat even horde/alliance spread.
---
It all depends on the type of addiction. Retail is ultra timegated. In classic I'm essentially already full pre bis and killed rag. From a retail point of view I could set down the game now until the next patch comes along.
---
Brain: “jump the corner.”
---
Me: “why?”
---
Brain: “ya gotta.”
---
BWL in particular will require a cape from Onyxia, although I believe it's BoE.
---
Yeah, but then he waits until you "donate" 1+ gold. If you initiate with me I won't be paying, personally. If I ask I'm all about that life.
---
Pretty funny pic imo
---
Why dont you play a normal server if you dont want to pvp ?
---
Sounds terrible
---
Heal as enh spec - just change your clothes.
---
Have not had problems like that so far on my PVP server.
---
But I have had some really fun social experiments that I would never have gotten in PVE.
---
In my opinion it forces you to group up with people and connect in chat, but hey do what you enjoy.
---
How is it fun to run an instance you don’t need anything from?
---
620km away, the thirst is unquenched.
---
Past tense. This post is the result.
---
I tend to tank and join ppl who spam abit of LFG/LFM and I got all the bis gear out of SM which was out of pure luck properly 2 times over but all grps tend to have people who ask if they can Need an item and I always say: "If you need if you dont greed".
---
If I lose out on loot then I run the Dungeon again but I do at least get the raw experience of the Dungeon.

I play a warrior tank and I don't charge money, reserve items nor do I demand all unneeded loot goes to me. No, I'm not making thousands of gold. Im still enjoying the game.

Its justified to boot people from your group who are wasting your time.  If you don’t mind waiting around that’s great, but you can’t expect everyone else to wait on you unless you explain yourself first.  Especially as an easily replaceable spot.

I see nothing wrong with this picture
---
You mean that expac where they retconned half of WC3's storyline and made spaghetti out of everything after that point?
---
I just downloaded it have haven't used it yet. It seems cool. What's wrong with it?
---
I wonder what would happen if I went there to start soloing dm tribute runs
---
This is an upgrade for me, can i need it?
---
So you think the release schedule of phases should be catered to the people who only play once in a while? There's a difference between playing casually and barely playing.
---
"abused" said the Horde Rogue. hmmm
---
PvE forces grouping a lot too
---
Ill have all those experiences when BGs unlock

Gah yeah I actually watched him and thought about it but I’ve always been Jah and he’s only ever been jahmilli so let’s hope no confusion arises. He seems inactive now too so that could be beneficial for me lmao. Good call though I was worried about this too.
---
Bis was definitely a thing in Wotlk, before that I was never tryhard enough to care so cant comment on the previous expansions.
---
Aye exactly. I remember the system well lol. I hit tank 8 and I was going pretty hard back then too. God speed to the mega nerds
---
Tipping tanks lmfao
---
BiS lists were a thing back then. I guess you were just too much of a noob to pay attention to it.
---
I charge the same to tank a dungeon I don't need, only difference is I tell them before I join the group.
---
"fren world" was a subreddit that started of as goofballs talking in baby speak but was quickly taken over by alt right. they used the term "fren" to mean anyone who held their racist beliefs. do your research before calling people idiots
---
:P I’m working on him haha. He’s also raid spec with 2k hp so a bit of a wet blanket out there. What’s your name?

It's pretty sad tbh, can't people just be happy with themselves? For themselves? Maybe tell a friends or your guildies but come on.
---
SMOrc me dink story make sense SMOrc
---
The spelling!!! D: my anxiety
---
Because there aren’t thousands of names being reported that have the name “girl” in it. It tracks commonly variable reports. So if “BJ” was considered vulgar and was in enough name reports, it would be deemed the common factor and the problem. If you have 6 names reported, BJGirl, Igivebjs, therapeist, rapeking, BJboy, and girlwhogivesbjs 
---
It’ll take common factor combination of letters
---
- BJ x 4 
---
- Rape x 2
---
- girl x 2
---
Then it’ll look at those words in unreported names. Paraphrased thought process of the animated bot- “Oh look, the word “girl” is used 17,000 times in different names but was only reported twice, the word “rape” is used in 17 different names and was reported twice, and the word BJ was used in 74 different names but reported 4 times.” I’m sure you can figure out what this information means
---
 - as for evidence, I don’t care enough to find it for you, I’m sorry, but If you actually want to find it I’m sure a few google searches will land you somewhere that blizzard, riot games does this as well, talks about it
---
I think your ideology speaks for it self when you say "If this dude actually dressed up in a KKK outfit and marched around in real life at a klan rally, you'd probably be right." He would probably be right?
---
WoW was built on the idea of different classes being different. Later they ditched that, but in Classic it holds :)
---
I always heal locks as long as I have the mana and time to spare from the tank healing, but it really bugs me when a lock taps down to 5 life while I’m drinking and then just stands there for 20 secs waiting for me to heal him instead of eating something.
---
Usually a renew when I see the lock is running out of mana, a sort of “go ahead and tap” move :d

My gph may be a lot less on my druid but the time it would take me to level a mage/hunter to 60 *just to farm dungeons*, I could have made decent cash on my druid. May as well just make an alt I enjoy. You don't have to do what everyone else is doing. Find your own grind.
---
MY EYES!!!! THEY BURN!!!
---
Then you are a poor guy that you cant spend 2-3 hours a day on some hobby.
---
I agree, that is also why I myself rolled a PvP character, to experience outside of the PvE danger also enough PvP danger while playing. The fact that you have to share your questing area with the opposing faction is really cool. I just did not expect Phase 2 this soon, and I did not had the time to play as much as others did. That whole 'don't roll PvP if you don't want to be farming material' you read a lot here is such a simple excuse. PvP is great when it's fair with the occasional ganking here and there. Getting ganked till the point the game is almost unplayable if you are not on top, is not. It's a big weakness of the format, esspecially with the current server sizes, and it 'being how it is' does not mean that this it how it should have been done.  
---
I hear here already talks about massive ganking around flight masters, making quest chains unplayable. Basically farming easy prey for that free honor. A lvl 48 character can never win from a lvl 60, and if their faction is as much busy with farming of the other faction, you also won't get much help.
---
Party leader was probably a mage which is why OP colored it the way he did.  Mage didn't want to party with clothies who'd roll on his gear.
---
You never know man, they have helped me numerous times
---
Hes trying to speak it into existance so he can do it lmao
---
The mental gymnastics in this thread is astonishing. So many people saying "It's just online why the big deal?" Crazy to me honestly.
---
"Magmadar is a DOG?!?"
---
– Just about every healer, 2005
---
At least many are down to farming 1-2 dungeons at most for a few missing pieces.
---
Look at this guide for paladins regarding AOE tanking:
---
https://classicwow.live/guides/860/paladin-aoe-farming-build-a-complete-guide-for-going-against-the-stigma-classic-wow
---
While some of this stuff wont apply to you the gear section should answer your question.
---
Lmao you'll be the one farmed. People will be honor capped in 2 weeks. Idk what you think they're adding to the game
---
I’m lv 40!
---
This is not the spirit of a PVP server.  It’s Horde vs Alliance and World of WARcraft not World of FRIENDcraft. You play on a PVE server for the right reasons.  You wouldn’t last out here.
---
It's fine if you are Horde. Unless you are on Heartseeker or one of the other rare Alliance-dominated pvp servers.
---
No.  It’s a meme version of friends.  Idgaf if 6 guys in some absolutely random subreddit used it differently
---
Very balanced raid comp. 5 of everything lol
---
Ha glad I’m not the only grinding wow player here ;)
---
A lot of people don't have fun at farming consumables etc. though and without pvp there is literally nothing else to do outside.
---
You've pretty much said everything about your problem. What might cause it? Many things in your life surely and what you don't remember is already taking it's tol in your subconscious.
---
The " I didn't have a bad experience" in pugging is hard to believe. Internet itself is already a toxic, obnoxious place and gaming intensifies that experience even more. If you have a sensitive aspect in your personality, the internet doesn't care about it at all and will even shred you more for it.
---
Hope this gets you some guidance.
---
A note on your second pro: there is little faction specific content past level 50, and a lot of quests have you kill mobs others farm for money or rep, so questing in the late 50s is pretty hard solo if the opposite faction outnumbers yours.
---
The gph is entirely dependent on your servers ghost mushroom/blindweed prices. GM was 1g30s yesterday and has dropped to 90s today. 
---
The fluctuations are real.
---
Let's be real, they're both skinner boxes but one is rewarding you for overcoming something difficult and for being social with other people.
---
The other can be a single player experience with little actual difficulty outside mythics.
---
Yeah, but when you're pugging and you get a hostile warlock. Fuck man those are the worst nightmare for healers to deal with.
---
They demand you give them your mana pool, they constantly take aggro by not watching their DPS/targets, they blame you when they die. And often they die because during any kind of stressful pull it's really hard to tell the difference between a lock taking aggro and a lock life tapping at a glance. Life tapping out of combat without drinking/eating to refill and expecting the healer to save them when they enter combat 30 seconds later at 1/3hp also happens.
---
A class is represented by its worst members not its best. Warlocks have by far the biggest potential to be a pain in healer's sides.
---
Weirdly I've had nothing but perfect warlocks since hitting 60 a month ago. My other guildie healer hasn't had the same luck though lol.
---
It was a thing in vanilla and TBC too.
---
Great addition, 10/10
---
Yeah think that's fair
---
Good luck if you're not in the biggest guild on your server.
---
Wait blizzard is releasing DHKs with phase 2? What is the point of that?
---
Lmao I hate the spammers. I understand getting people to watch you seems impossible but I couldn’t bring myself to do things like that. Thanks dude &lt;3
---
I'm tryna bust out lvl 50 before it ends. Dou t I'll get one.
---
Wait how am I greedy, if its a roll its literally ANTI greedy lmao, it gives everybody a chance lol
---
Is that a thing? I know nothing about how this stuff is monetized.
---
2004 iMac
---
Download the addon “RareAware” it shows you all the rare spawns on your map with respawn times, etc.
---
Glad I got mine when they were 250-300g each. Thanks to PvP Ranking coming soon, it's just going to get higher and higher...
---
Nah settle down.  The “congressmen” is an idiot for going after blizzard like that.   It’s the internet you’re going to see offensive things. Grow up.
---
I remember people obsessing over gear scores during lunch king.
---
(I'm not touching that autocorrect)

It's 7-8 spell power. Still not worth the grind

no it is not ok that you took a screen shot with your phone, you should be ashamed of yourself,

1 group for each class... Genius!

Your friend with the big vanilla brain escape plan.
---
Mage's main stat truly is Int.
---
Lol, skill can beat masses any day. Just like my guild stopped 100+ horde from getting into brm. If you use the right tactics you can win any fight.
---
If they get reported they will have to change it.
---
You're replying to an old comment  ( you totally sont care) and you're still not providing evidence just speculation.  I'm just going to say you don't care to provide evidence because you can't find any.   Have a nice day Mr.speculation
---
Bonebiter is better
---
Are you a troll mage? Might be that you're not attacking beasts but another mob type. Since trolls get 5% increased dmg against beasts.
---
you can do the same things with less screen real estate needed by just making one set of mouseover macros and using those with any raid frames
---
or using healbot or any healbot clone and setting up certain clicks for each spell instead of needing them off to the side of raid frames like this
---
Join a guild with 60's that don't mind rolling up in force to camp bullies that wanna camp lowbies.
---
That's literally what I said. "Sure these people can be banned". That's different from preventing it: Blizzard can't just ban racists before they do racist stuff, because, obviously Blizzard can't know they're racists.
---
If these particular people were already known for being racists then yeah you're right. Blizzard should've banned them before. But the names of these players or their guild names aren't offensive or racist in themselves. Blizzard couldn't have known these were racists unless they had a recorded history of it. Community managers can't smell racists.
---
I got three stacks from a dude I rezzed in Tanaris, randomly. Supa sweet!
---
I can't remember NOT having a tough time in Eastern Plaguelands
---
Absolutely agree
---
At least for me when I'm saying something is gay, I usually mean that it just sucks, but I don't think gay people suck, I'm partially gay myself anyway. It's more of the gamer banter which is why we use these words
---
Hunters would like a word with you...
---
To be fair, I'm perfectly fine with reserving stuff as long as it's within reason and one item sounds fine. I do the same as a paladin right now to pad out my ret and heal gear. Just so much easier to be the tank instead of that healer nobody listens to when you say slow down but as a tank I decide the pace and make sure my healer always has enough mana while the  rest is pulled in a efficient fasion.
---
PARKOUR PARKOUR
---
They're not in the game yet. They're introduced with the AQ patch.
---
Fuck I'm not ready lol
---
Imagine thinking this was in any way virtuous to begin with
---
The better versions of this type of add-on make it so when you click on the players health bar it will cast a spell based on how you click (left, right, middle, plus shift, alt, Ctrl modifiers). Better than having to left click on the particular spell next to the bar for the heal you need.
---
Yeah, most of the complication for gearing is for the high end players. Generally, the average players will gain more for learning their class than min-maxing their gear. But, many aren't aware they are among the average and want to mimic the actions of the extreme high end, so they feel compelled to join in on this. It eventually causes burnout and toxicity. And, imo, that's where retail fucks up the biggest.
---
There are none on the AH because they are not in the game yet. IIRC they will come with the AQ phase
---
It stands for Bust In Sluts, congrats you are the father!
---
There is no pvp loot in phase 2. That comes phase 3
---
So because you don't specifically remember it, it didn't exist. Got it.
---
you were a shitter from vanilla to wotlk.
---
bis predates wow and was absolutely 100% used in vanilla even extremely early on.
---
I still have that addon. It's called brains.

This survey is WoW Classic themed and can not be answered as a subset of the data from the census. It should be allowed to be posted for the sake of data collection. It will be of interest to the WoW Classic community.

Hey could you tell me the addon for the character stats pls ? Looks way better then the extended Charakter stats addon
---
Especially if you have even one other alt, spending a couple minutes practicing that characters keybinds when you first log in can help if you can’t afford catch-up tim
---
Cuz I know otherwise I’m tryin to dispel magic and shit on warlock and wasting healthstones and whatnot
---
Or just level fishing
---
Video games attract all people, pretty much.
---
Please be on thunderfury.. I'll pay a few of my no life guildies to make sure you never leave Org.
---
There is no Player vs Player when it's one sided beyond belief lol
---
so feral druid is your classic!
---
Refer to the first comment on the thread, this isn't a complaint post :P   
---
I don't play the game casually so I don't mind the release of phase 2. I was referring to my SO who plays the game to read quest text, pick herbs and the fun tidbits like Halloween wands which she went nuts over how fun they are. Just having a bit of fun with the opposing party's view that phase 2 was rushed is all. No harm done.
---
You saw Grindr ***XTRA*** on classicwow.
---
OP is desperate and more than likely a super ~~saiyan~~ ho.
---
sylvanas has always had plot armor she just fucks anyone who gets in her way.  even when you win you lose.
---
if shes a raid boss the encounter will probably be unwinnable.  blizzard loves them some sylvanas
---
Did you miss the comment about the Urban Dictionary entry from 2007? These were known racists long before Classic launched. I imagine people on the server have been complaining this whole time yet it took months and congressional intervention to get this clown banned.
---
Blizzard can't prevent all occurrences but there would be fewer if people saw players being banned for it.
---
I disagree with this too.  You guys have the Solo playing retail mentality.  This is supposed to force you to either group up and fight together or relinquish the area to the opposite faction for the time being.  Your only option isn’t to keep trying to quest in the same area as aggressive opposite faction players.  Do something about it.
---
Are you RP walking on a pvp server. Bro.
---
The roguelike looks dope if it's what I imagine. Not gonna lie, would play retail only for this with 4 other friends
---
Am DPS, can confirm
---
Performance anxiety...  Do you have trouble peeing  when there are other people there?
---
He didn’t have to take you to 1 health. /Forfeit is better

New to WoW and my first character is a Night Elf Rogue (sword build). Loving it so far and I had a couple questions: I’ve been told to hold off on buying weapons because better ones will drop in dungeons/while grinding. Is that the case? Should I just save gold and accept a potentially lesser weapon until a better one drops? Or buy the best weapon available for my level? Also, any good recommendations for leveling herbalism faster? Thanks!
---
It seems I’ve triggered a nerve.
---
The point is I have higher echelons and priorities of hobbies:
---
Wow doesn’t make you impressive to anyone else, it’s objectively a massive waste of time.
---
I’d rather go for my next belt in BJJ, improve my chess elo, lift more in the gym,
---
Go with my road crew and bike outside...
---
Yeah there’s way more I’d rather do than prioritize my time to sit and play w video game:
---
That’s the difference between you and I though.
---
Also, go read through my comments, I am the farthest thing from poor :)
---
Nice.
---
According to [https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/blacksmithing-classic-wow-1-300](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/blacksmithing-classic-wow-1-300)
---
260-270 mithril spurs
---
270-295 imperial plate bracers
---
295-300 imperial plate boots
---
Tanks admittedly do pay way more for repairs than anyone else, they may not need anything in the run or are just bored. Paying for their time isnt a big deal.
---
Meh, I'm a casual this time around. I'm having a great time tbh. I'm Well aware I'm way behind and always will be, just depends on mind set IMO.
---
Yknow, I dunno. Maybe it was a typo or maybe I just had a brain fart
---
Should be 40%
---
Hell no. Armorsmithing is the most expensive profession to level, and very few pieces are actually desired by people to the point where a profit can be made.
---
I’m not talking about the dude with server first pattern charging 300g or whatever, I’m talking about just trying to craft the helm for any profit whatsoever, which simply can’t be done now that people can get it for free.
---
&gt; over 200 thorium that does not sell very well  
---
I thought it did, what gives?
---
&gt; oes nothing but punish people who invest time into the game. Wow is bone dry without pvp and I hope 
---
the whole idea of classic  and vanilla is to get gear, and thn create your own content, I dont need blizz to give me content, i just want to gear, and do my own thing, not always on the grind for new raids, dungeons
---
Trying to find the right Hunter pet for Onyxia. Right now, I'm not sure if Hunter pets can melee her while she's in the air, so I'm thinking Wind Serpent for the ranged attack. Or does it not matter and your pet will be dead 100% of the time anyway?
---
You’re gonna have idiots from every class. I’m leveling a lock now and main thing I leveled first just like in vanilla was  First Aid so I can tap and bandage back up if need be.  
---
The biggest strain I have noticed on healers because I’m leveling a priest also like in vanilla is in dungeons where CC was intended to be used either people aren’t using it or are breaking it causing the healer to have to do way more work and use way more mana than they should. Especially at lower levels. Also people who can cleanse stuff that no one else in the party can flat out not doing it like Mages and Curses or Shamans not getting rid of poisons primarily because they are wanting to get high DPS numbers instead of mechanics and this isn’t retail mechanics matter.
---
standard player movement
---
Because Dishonorable kills were a part of the honor system when it was launched in vanilla.
---
unless I'm not understanding your question...
---
I hope they change the AQ gate mats just to simulate what it was like then, instead of having guilds stockpile the materials early.
---
I wanted to see how the moment was "ruined"
---
You sound like a cunt.
---
Not for your original post on the forums -- that seemed fine to me.
---
But getting banned and then complaining to reddit about it is pathetic.
---
Try to be less cunty.
---
Good on PvP servers
---
He’s been doing this for years, definitely not coming out of the woodworks.
---
I don't normally upvote twitch clips, because they're usually garbage.
---
This is quality content someone fucked with you so you fucked with them and theres video.
---
People socialize in game m8. Everyone needs to accept that there are massive gaps in player types. Complaining because the player you, or anyone else is, is moot in itself.
---
"What if i started doing a little EEET, OH! My gosh i thought it was a cast!"
---
I haven't, no. Again, if these are actually known offenders then you're 100% right. 
---
There's still a lot of clueless people out there though who think that stuff like this is preventable for first-time offenders. I suppose you can redirect my comment to those people then.
---
When you're not completely confident in what you're doing it can be hard to put yourself in a situation with a bunch of strangers where your role critical to the groups success. 
---
Maybe you could start out by joining a few pugs that are looking for a healer for dungeons beneath your level?
---
So white old men are mad and upset people are roleplaying in a video game what these rich old white men and their fathers once did in real life? Who should be more ashamed? SMH.
---
Hello. Been leveling my warrior and just hit 35. Still a few weeks grom 60, but with phase 2 coming soon I wonder whether I'll miss something by not getting 60 already. What are the features of phase 2?
---
Also as warrior is it worth IT to farm Herod just to get his evert item?
---
Are you kidding, I absolutely LOVE running dungeons as a tank, especially my pally! I used to sit around all day (worked wierd rotating shifts) and just run dungeons back to back when I wasn't raiding in retail. The drops I got from the run plus coin almost always covered my costs, and if they didn't, it wasn't too hard for me to be out of pocket (and no I don't have tons of gold just horded up, don't think in retail I've even ever broken 5k) as I said, higher repair costs are part of being a tank. Consider it your version of buying reagents lol
---
Are Blue Sappires the hardest gem to get apart from Arcane Crystals?
---
Just saying that if your daily playtime doesn't allow even one level 60 dungeon run then you have pretty much nothing to do at 60.
---
No he blamed blizzard
---
Oh man, the times I have been ganked and another nearby alliance player just completely ignored it happening. Same with that the local defense chat cannot be more dead than it is now. I really hope the introduction of the honor system will indeed introduce this 'Fight for your faction and save your teammates'-mentality more. But I've not seen it yet, unfortunately. Everyone is busy with their own thing, and it's hard to find people willing to put up an actual fight.
---
okay nice to know, it's my first time playing wow so i don't know all the commands
---
Hey!! Crimson Corps on Incendius would welcome you! We are a competitive PVP and PVE Alliance guild.  We have both hardcore and casual players.  We host guild events and guild pvp and help lowbies when we can!  I personally will run you through dungeons and we will set you up with 4 10 slot bags and some gold to get you started!! 
---
Look forward to hearing back from you!
---
But it’s dope as hell
---
Can you explain? Do you mean 50s being farmed for honor?
---
Professions?
---
The Cape isn't an onyxia drop, it is crafted, but requires scales that can only be skinned from Onyxia.
---
Good shit, let's get rid of these bots
---
SIX warlocks &amp; Four rogues??? That’s how you know it was taken in 2005
---
Depends on the server, gathering professions aren’t a great option on crowded servers.
---
No one cares though.
---
Your experience does not equal everyone else’s as there were plenty of conversations in my old raid groups about who should get what based on which class it would be bis for.
---
The only thing you'll miss is the safety of ganking as it will increase a lot when p2 lands. 
---
Helm and axe is very good and should be farmed.
---
special thanks to our friends from rägä and nope, helping us with our vendetta :)
---
Every time I see one of these I have to scan the raid, hoping it's from my old guild. My screenshot folder is long lost, but man it'd be cool to see. :)
---
The thing about a tip is a tip is voluntary.  I don't go into dungeons with Tanks who *feel entitled* to a tip.  If I'm gonna pay for a tank, which sometimes happens, it's agreed upon before the invite gets sent, in which case it isn't a tip, it's payment. 
---
If there are no agreements, and at the end if it was a good run, or a difficult run for non-tank reasons, I'll tip them out.
---
If the run was terrible because the tank was terrible, I won't tip, likely because my tip is being spent on my repairs.
---
Then why are they worried about when this content phase gets released?
---
Bosses account for only so much of the time you spend in a raid but even so you'll have pet positioning at Ragnaros and moving with the melees. Otherwise looking at the buffwipers you got pet control at every giant which, unless you like us have assigned healers healing pets, will need to move em in and out to avoid the static timers that'll eventually kill every pet in the raid.    
---
If we're looking at logs, which are hugely influenced by how good each raid is, then we can compare your last raid to one of apes alt raids: In your last raid the hunter pets are active just above 28% of the encounter time, whereas in apes they manage an activity of 75,56%, resulting in 237% more effective pet usage or 98k damage. With this uptime the pets are accounting close to 16% of the total hunter dps - which with a blue skies scenario of 100% uptime would put them at 21,08% of total hunter dps.    
---
Hunter is a very restricted class in raids when it comes down to pure dps and the only decent way to get consistently ahead of equally skilled hunters should be by either paying attention to the pet, or bribing one of your healers to keep it up at all times. If we look at speedrunning the delay will cost a hunter \[0.01, 0,4\]s on each pull or pet movement transition, it is a huge party pooper.
---
I love posts like this.  Do you expect people to be outraged and side with you?  Everyone know's what you meant by "f them."  Your catty abbreviation does not any better than actually spelling it out.
---
Well, as someone that you would probably label alt right....you're an idiot.
---
there was a dude dressed as winnie the pooh rofl
---
They did not launch together
---
Why would you roll a pvp server if you don't want the pvp? Where is the logic?
---
I just restarted there, why's the community bad? Seems fine to me in /global
---
Well done, one less bot in to worry about
---
Isn't it a front flip
---
You need to come to terms with this. I'm not even 40 Yet brother and I'm just enjoying the time I get lol. I No lifed Vanilla, times have changed.
---
You couldn’t pay me to use that lol
---
Apart from new challenging raid content.
---
I’ll heal locks as long as they know they get last priority when life tapping. I will keep tank and others healed first, and will heal a lock up from life tapping when I know there is no other threat of dying. Also will throw them a renew between drinking, but of the tank is chain pulling the lock will have less health to life tap with. 
---
In my experience I haven’t had many lock problems or it might just be I haven’t noticed.
---
Why would you ask in r/wow if you want to know how many classic players play retail?
---
I think combining it into one /cast should work. I.e.
---

You people really need to go to some social classes lol. Or  communicate with some people. How can you play an MMO but be this bad at sensing sarcasm?
---
No:(
---
You can 3 man it with the traditional tank healer and dps trifecta.  It is easier with a regular group of five though.
---
Because the game is better without DHKs. Might as well have the town raid destroying patch altogether (BGs, DHKs).
---
Can paladins bubble other players or only themselves?
---
We did it with 6, tank heals and 4 dps
---
There are two possible issues that could cause this that come to mind.
---
1. Storage degradation, your storage drive is dying, simply put
---
2. Something else eating up disk read/write time in the background
---
Try grabbing Crystal Disk Info and seeing what your Hard drive's health looks like.
---
You monster!
---
Like claw 1 2 3 4 etc thar increases your levelling speed?
---
Meh, to each their own. I've done it, loved it at times. Ive got 2 kids now so my time is much different than 15 years ago. Some people want to play games  with their spare time and that's fine. Its obviously not for everyone.
---
And I'll argue socializing in discord is pretty much the same as, in the real world.  When you spend 6 Plus hours a day with the same people in a headset, you become pretty good friends.  Because people aren't in a bar or at a friends house, doesn't mean it's not socializing.   People make lifelong friends from games like this, I understand that's weird to grasp for some.
---
I personally hate taking more than one of any class just cause the utility you get from a variety of classes is usually helpful. Plus when there’s more than one rogue in the group they are adamant about opening up with cheap shot and it hurts my rage generation lol. I’ve gotten used to waiting for the stuns to finish then taunt and throw a couple sunders on the stunned target.
---
Not talking about him, talking about all the people in the comments. You can find them, just keep scrolling... 😜
---
I just rerolled, it's never too late :)
---
Do you know Captain Hindsight too? I want his autograph.
---
Lol this made me giggle because last night I actually got mine. Thanks Jed
---
Does it really inspire people to be nice? "Look! I said a nice fluffy thing in general chat, and people put hearts in the chat!" Great dude. Awesome. I'm so inspired right now.
---
At least the same amount of time again, if not slightly more. Think 44 is the halfway point. 
---
It’s a serious grind, stick at it though.
---
No. Quit when MoP came out, came back for legion because.... well... illidan - Wasnt impressed. Refused to do BFA.
---
👍🏼
---
Lucifron oder venoxis? Richtig?
---
Dash and charge share a cooldown, there’s no point teaching them both
---
That moment of utter defeat and self reflection on his face, I live for that moment.
---
&gt;  People will be honor capped in 2 weeks.
---
you actually have no fucking clue what you are taking about holy shit. there is no honor cap, only rating cap. and it resets weekly, that's when your rank is updated. go research more before spreading whatever bullshit you are trying to lol.
---
Bop, bind on pick up, and soul bound all mean the exact same thing.
---
Legend on Stallag is pretty chill. We've got just under 400 players. All levels very collaborative about dungeons and questing. And some interested in raising eventually too.
---
Edit: we are an Alliance Guild. My main is Rakath if you want to add me and I'll invite you
---
never actually
---
Clear your cache folder!! You can do this in the game files!
---
Shawshank  Redemption 2.
---
Rogues have friends? I thought you just had victims and future victims.
---
No I don't. Legion was awesome but BFA was basically WoD:2, and shadowlands is just... not my speed. I just kinda don't get it, like why/how? Very tired of retail no longer being about alliance vs horde.
---
Is argue that the physicality aspect is what’s missing, and is why leading psychologists argue that while games are fine, spending time around real people is paramount.
---
Hand placement, eye contact, reading social ques... it’s the most important thing for getting ahead in life.
---
Spending all your social time in a headset is sad AF.
---
There's always a lack of Tanks on our server. If you get a Tank, you can get a full group in 2 mins. instead of 2 hours.
---
Thrash Blade is better.
---
You have thunder bluff which is an awesome centralized trainer imo.
---
Depends on what build you're going for and why. Curse of Exhaustion and 3/4 Imp. Curse of Exhaustion are decent filler points on your way to Shadow Mastery.
---
Have you tried deleting the Cache folder?
---
Asa Blade is too slow for Rogues. They need a fast offhand for poison and sword spec procs.
---
I play a lock and when I do it that low I bandage. One runecloth bandage heals me back to almost full.
---
It is... Guess now I gotta walk backwards.
---
dragon's call :)
---
Play on a PvE server then. You've had plenty of time to hit 60.
---
Try deleting the Cache folder only before booting up the game and see if it makes a difference.
---
Also maybe an addon is causing the problem, try checking which ones are outdated or not really made for Classic.
---
Dude what? Why ever delete progress? Just keep them on your account
---
Ah, having spells other than Frostbolt on your bar. Good old times.
---
Aw Thankyou so much man cheers for taking the time.
---
Is there a way to disable or hide the raid panel that pops up when you are in a party? The panel that slides out when you click the arrow and gives options to mark raid targets, convert to raid, etc.
---
I use ShadowedUF but cant figure out how to hide that little raid interface panel that hugs the left hand side of the screen
---
No no no! garotte not cheap shot in dungeons!
---
I am not claiming that it's technically impossible to solo kill a lvl 61 elite, just that it is completely impractical to farm them for gear like Teebu's
---
it's low hanging fruit to gain ez political points.
---
nevermind actual slavery going on around the world these 20 ppl in world of Warcraft are dressing up like kkk members and being racist!
---
I shouldn't have to tell you how trash Horrigan and his guild are to prove i'm not a kkk member but it's also stupid that a congressman would point to this of all things.
---
nope but on the other side i don't have mana.. :P
---
but  its not like i ever got bread :(
---
Female paladin. Close
---
I will be honest, the "I love you" at the end, is a bit much. 
---
But generally, spreading kindness and positivity usually is not just an "empty message." Some people really do care that deeply about everyone else, and as much as so many people enjoy knocking each other down... Some just want to boost each other up.
---
Hell, I would argue that on the rare occasion there are the few individuals that do just love all of humanity openly and endlessly.
---
I just say Gratz when their pet levels.
---
Shouldn't a Classic Warlock PvP video be titled "With Literally All the Odds"?  :D
---
maybe be a little bit more humble and don't call people oblivious plebs then. it comes off as super pretentious and douchey.
---
Imagine playing wow with sound turned on.
---
This is true, then all the jerk off dps only wars learn they need to tank for gear.
---
This is why my friend who likes to auto follow me always ends up in the water.
---
YOU CAUGHT ME FAM. SARCASM IS SO EASY TO PICK UP THRU TEXT. LOL. fucking clown. “take social classes” i bet you’re a real life of the party everywhere you go aren’t you? you’re just as much of a loser being on here as everyone else. get a grip
---
Yeah some do, but I agree with most that main spec &gt; off spec. I rolled a Druid alt and am main specced feral tank but I also have a healing set (which I collected while tanking when no one else needed caster drops). I switch back and forth. I take caster gear if I’m healing or leather feral gear if I’m tanking. The rest of the group doesn’t know what you consider your main spec to be, they only see what you’re doing at the moment. So, if you just loot everything, obviously they’re gonna think you’re a ninja
---
Well tbh it's your first time playing this game. Take as much time as you need to accomplish what you want. Those people who are closely following what's up next are normally those who have played the game to the death and started again. They remember most parts of the whole story and all they are interested in is to be at the top. 
---
So yes, it is okay to be slow on a PvP server.
---
Same
---
You don't know the history of classic wow then.
---
This is a propa “get fucked” moment.
---
Holy shit... I know him!
---
He was famous back in 2004 to 2006 on the Bleeding Hollow server. They only allowed white humans in and they were the most fierce pvp clan on the server. Horrigan only travelled in large packs too, to prevent any ganking attempts. I killed him once and still remember it.
---
You’re missing the concept of supply and demand. He’s filling a role that is lacking while levelling. He has the right to make certain demands.
---
\/yield also works :-)
---
NP :P Thing is, I plan to drop Enchanting for Engineering as I really never got to use it for PvP on my Mage in Retail.
---
It wasn't removed until the TBC lua update, I wouldn't call that quick
---
Yea I have those two categories summed up in one word. Horde.
---
If YOU need a tank for say Strat Live whereby I need absolutely nothing from the instance. 
---
If I ask for either single orb reserve or even let’s say 15g per run from the group why is that unreasonable? 
---
Did I say I don’t enjoy tanking? I love making shit happen for a group. All I’m saying is I don’t have the ability to AoE farm or solo Mara for money like you can so why make me feel bad for making offers BEFORE instance runs when it effectively benefits everyone?
---
fren-world, clown-world, whatever-world.
---
They were subs in which people would fairly openly discuss how they hated the jews... no wait, the non-frens, non-clowns, non-honkers.
---
It's idiotic. But then again they are idiots.
---
Should have no problem doing it in onyixa but the question is are you already threat capping your dps?
---
My noob friend I've been playing with is all about this life. They always provide water to those in need without asking. Makes me so proud...
---
[What I live for](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/941699388199437043/6D535E3F503BE1BF1D75306765C4E2243DEE12A0/)
---
No emergency meter, not authentic
---
There won’t be a questing guide like this, as they are designed for efficiency.  If you are x level there is a specific zone or area to grind until level x+1, then you move on as the other quests in the area now give less xp or are simply not worth the time needed to complete for the xp.  
---
Best thing you can do is use questie or something similar, it will show all the quests available to pick up from your mini or world map, you can even adjust it to show older ones you may have missed and outleveled.  Its less efficient for leveling speed but more efficient for completionists imo.
---
So do you consider this rushed or no
---
I dunno man. If you invest thousands of hours into something, no matter what. You will be pretty decent at it. 
---
So if you take all those wow hours and put them into something useful in life who knows...
---
Ok thanks! I’m only lvl 23 right now so I’ve been running Deadmines and I’m gonna move to Stockades soon
---
Another note: I know this is not necessarily a good idea for Ragnaros because it will be more difficult to intercept back in if you get knocked back
---
Lel
---
If they’re not able to take aggro from you when they’re going all out I wouldn’t worry about it, but ask them if they’re slowing their dps while watching threat meters
---
oh yea sure.im a 20yrs old male,i can speak english/hungarian/serbian.I played retail a lil bit, got 2 lvl120 chars.I really enjoy classic but alone its a little boring.I dont care which server we play on.But I pref pvp.
---
I do agree that horde tend to group up more than alliance and answer calls of distress.  IMO your best bet is to join a guild that has some sort of focus on PVP.  Mine is good at sending people to go help those who are getting camped.  I am the Co-GM of my guild specifically and sometimes I even give DKP to guildies for killing horde who are camping our lowbies.  We even host PvP events and recently did an STV takeover and formed a raid to protect questing lowbies for a few hours.
---
It's literally a fridge door taken off a fridge with special silly magnets. That can't possibly be covered by an NDA.
---
Assassination is better according to our master and saviour Shadow Panther.
---
I was on a PVE server during vanilla when this happened.  There will be plenty of players looking to fight. It will just be different as it will be in specific spots. 
---
TM/SS was a nonstop battle. Also, the reward/rank system is based on how much the whole server plays.  It kind of scales relative to the server action to an extent. I think you'll be ok
---
Use tf only if you'd be wasting an energy tick otherwise, is what I've heard. From what I understand, the energy is better used on claw, yes.
---
They can only do what once a week?
---
Forgot the /s
---
Lol. If that actually happened to anyone, they're assholes, but its kind of funny.
---
Isn't it the other way around, protects from melee but not spell?
---
I started with a warrior got to 19 and got tired of dying too.  Tried a mage to 41 and it just wasn't for me...  Never been much of a caster guy in games.  Rerolled as a druid and love it.  Only lvl18 but it's a blast.  Never stop to eat or drink at LVL 10. Kill your mob, shift out, heal and shift back to bear.  Druids are the easy button for lvling imo.  
---
(I mained a warrior and druid from vanilla to wotlk)
---
For me it's english/german. When are you playing normally?
---
dont forget the half assed attempted at blocking out his own name only and including the whisper for the extra karma
---
That’s the world of Warcraft that you play-ay-ay-ay
---
Thanks
---
Still got a while before I can sell the twink gear I've accumulated
---
Ok thanks for the advice!
---
Thank you :)
---
Try to make yourself feel better about being a piece of shit because you think everyone else feels the same way.. yikes
---
well today and tomorrow all day I think, but the other days i work till 15:00.after that im usually available.
---
Get dodge/parry to 15%+ and crit above 23% if you can. Hit depends on your race but should be no problem getting the gear. Your main rage gen in fury prot is crits and getting hit gives a lot too. Honestly just wait till the next few phases for it. The reason for fury prot is threat gen cause of higher dps which you cannot contend with as shield.
---
It takes \~8 seconds to replace a DPS. It takes an hour+ to replace a tank. Nobody needs you, cuz' there's dozens in line to join the group.
---
Chuck Norris once visited the Virgin Islands. Now they're just called Islands.
---
I share the same point of view, I hate the "motivational posters" with some generic nature background that you see girls share all over social media. Seeing the the stuff OP wrote in general chat wouldn't inspire me, suddenly cure depression or make me jolly all day - but I can see other people receive it that way, and thats good for them. So the impact this post has is almost entirely positive for the community, and that's why it's a good thing, but not necessarily for me.
---
He played a belf demon hunter in retail
---
wp
---
Murlocs and worgs along the shining strand. They’re closer to 12-13 I think but wolf and clam meat sell well on the AH. (Alts with money leveling cooking maybe?)
---
Mages I've met in dungeons usually just open the trade window and put food in. But if I dont "Tip" they just cancel.
---
Ah yes but you see, in order to become level 60 you need to level past 40
---
I would say no one, at least not that I've noticed, takes into account Demon Armor. Most times when the group stops to drink the lock can pop off a couple taps and replenish their mana and have most of their health replenished by the Demon Armor buff by the time everyone else is finished drinking. It doesn't work that well in the middle of a fight, you burn mana faster than the buff can replenish, but during the downtime it's great, and leaves a lock replenishing health much faster than mana.
---
That’s a fact.
---
Ya the billions of dollars those artists raised from loot boxes just never happened then right? Clearly Blizzard is a small indie company barely scraping by *rolls eyes*
---
The ones in burning steppes? Not much, 3 lvl 56s can do it (heal dps/dps)
---
Pretty common. Just check the ah. Depends on the cost of thorium and hearts of fire of course too.
---
www.google.come
---
go forth and prosper
---
And don't worry about dual engi as a warrior, just stockpile faps.
---
TIL you only need to use toilet paper if you shit your pants
---
Ive been on this guys server in retail for a long time and hes a pos
---
Good ol strategy live lol
---
Ban this fool
---
Not every server is. I'm on a 60/40 PvP server.
---
My hunter isn't Horde though so I'm at least a bit safer on my Alliance Hunter.
---
*cries as 48 priest on feralis horde*
---
more druids than either mage or hunter. wow has certainly changed
---
Sounds like they are a priest.
---
As far as story-telling with an MMO goes, WotLK seemed fine. Arthas had a fitting end. What did you want from it?
---
Considering its a bold faced lie since they've already confirmed OW 1 and OW 2 can play with each other. OW 2 is basically just a story mode and some skins from the way it looks and is described.
---
I do enjoy the time that I get, but that is about to change when I’m getting farmed by 60’s at level 48
---
Kromcrush has a good balance. Its something like 55/45, Horde favor. At least, that's what it was the last time I checked.
---
I'm Not screwed, I'm aware I'll always be behind. I'm Enjoying myself at a casual pace this time
---
I wouldn't recommend this spec. Isn't Slam really bad? Unbridled Wrath vs Booming Voice is debatable. Also, Imp bloodrage and Last Stand are better than measly 10 def from 5 talent points.
---
Not really. You’re colluding to win for your friend. Was the random another mage?
---
I like to innervate casters when I pass by as they are grinding. I also top off melee with a rejuv. 
---
It's a simple action but it really makes people's days.
---
100% correct
---
It stands for bis in slot
---
layered while I stood there
---
You may not like it , but it's what the ideal male body looks like.
---
Wait Jed is up 75% of the time? I’ve done 9 runs of UBRS and he hasn’t spawned. I figured he was relatively rare. Sad haha
---
Yeah, i cringe when i hear such things and feel like they are gonna give all mages bad rep
---
yeah never did this ever
---
Yeah I've seen posts about people moving to kromcrush!
---
Yeah hes been on BH forever. Always been a racist , alt-right scumbag.
---
I don't have +55 yet, but would be great to get

How is Liberty racist?

That's some of the worst double speak ever.

---
Honest question, no judgement, just wondering:
---
So what do you play for then?
---
It seems like as soon as a new wave of content releases, you'll smash your way through it. Have it on grind in a week or two. Then your raid leader forces you to rush through 3 raids a week instead of 2. 
---
Then what?
---
Wait around for the next phase?
---
Good in raids, but not so much for soloing.
---
Not really, the number itself is effectively an arbitrary unit, but running it back and having to completely rebalance how you level stat wise, zones, gear, etc. For the sake of nothing more than "making the number smaller" is completely fucking stupid. Can't wait to see this idea blow up in their face.
---
I love the people jumping to conclusions without knowing any context of this screenshot. Is this group running WC, ZF, or DM? Is the tank a Lv48 fury tank or full raid BiS Lv60 prot tank?
---
I have grouped with plenty of players who do not loot every enemy they can loot in a dungeon and do not roll on every item, even when greeding. Some players have no problems passing on stuff they don't need. My groups often have people even pass on chests voluntarily. There are players who just want to get quests done, and will happily give up greed drops to make sure they level up.
---
Yes, reserving all greed drops might seem...well, greedy, but it's on par with the Righteous Orb reserving situation in Live Strat. Yes, we can all point and laugh when their group doesn't fill, but as long as they're announcing it beforehand, I don't think it's an issue (or an outrageous demand in the first place). Certainly would need more context about the screenshot to make a judgment.
---
The value of goods and services vary based on time of day and from person to person. Unless you are willing to offer the same service at the same time to the same people, there's not much reason to try and throw shade at them.
---
Wait how does the spyglass work? I didn’t know this was a thing. I don’t have UBRS key
---
Question: why does he act so pissed over getting killed once? I mean he just have to run back?
---
&gt; mouseover macros
---
Were there even such things in vanilla?  The whole @mouseover syntax began with the 2.0 patch if I'm remembering right.  It's been so long since the modern language came out that I don't remember what the 1.x language was like anymore.
---
The speculative bubble has already started. The people who stocked up and are selling now are the ones who make money, those that are buying into it now will be left holding the bags.
---
Exactly like what happened with Pristine Black Diamonds.
---
You just have to be aware that once you'll hit level 48 (ot was it 49?) you will give honour points to level 6 players starting from November 12th.  
---
You'll be nothing more than walking honour points for the geared lvl 60s farming for pvp rank.
---
I expect a lot of slow levellers  to quit in phase 2 or be limited to farming dungeons or some deep caves.
---
Wait is that profitable?
---
My wife does this when she wants to punish me for using the follow setting
---
Jealous of your time. Thats insane
---
It's not going to be that bad. People tend to exaggerate. Worse case is you get a little more PvP practise which is never a bad thing.
---
They aren't meaningless because your rank gain is determined by how you compare to the rest of participating players on your faction, with the top few % being cleared for officer ranks 7+ once they go through the first weeks of leveling the enlisted ranks. With battlegrounds being inactive, that means consistent honor point income per player is much less, therefore point requirements for each rank in the PvP system will also be lower. Were you around when this system was first released in 2005?
---
Can confirm.
---
Source: Am priest and I also hate everyone.
---
Whirlwind is a gamechanger; when paired with Sweeping Strikes against two targets it basically means Whirlwind deals double damage against both targets. Not to mention that your main damage output won't be clunky-ass Heroic Strike anymore. You'll get an instant extra attack without giving up the rage that would be gained off of your next autoattack.
---
Get that next level and see how you feel. I started to hate leveling until I got to that point, then I really fell in love with the class.
---
1 name 2 games 2 dev teams and you'll make money blizzard common. Runescape has shown the ways now just follow it.
---
Yeah that's not how it is on pvp servers at all.  You seem to be very confused.
---
&gt; It's the same game, you just die more
---
No it really isn't the same game.  I get it, you're all defensive because of your decision but you needn't be.  I'm not saying there aren't valid reasons to want to play on pve servers - I'm simply saying that pvp servers are more rewarding because they have drastically increased player agency.
---
Let me help you understand.  Ever played any diablo games?  It has two modes, hardcore and softcore.  There are legitimate reasons to choose to play softcore, you don't want to lose your character and progress if you die.  But those that do play hardcore and clear high end content are clearly achieving something greater than the same on softcore because of that extra difficulty.
---
It's rather like playing a single player game on easymode and claiming it's the same as playing on the hardest mode "you just die less".  The concept is completely ridiculous.
---
LOL we all as humans should be ashamed of these players. It's literally the least blizz can do to silence hate speech on their privately owned platform.
---
I’m glad people at least know of this exception, I have Crohn’s and it’s made me have to rapid-afk in a group before lol
---
(Still tell your group though people)
---
I did 5/5. Couldn't find anything else to put it in worth while
---
Can you not buy these two trinkets or are they that expensive?
---
The majority of Reddit WoW players had already made up their mind about not liking the next expansion before it was even announced. I'm not surprised they hate everything, the OP of this comment thread literally neglected to list like half the expansions content.
---
But you also get more xp per kill/quest as you level so it’s not really a constant
---
Or you missinterpreted my post.  He has his own issues to sort, therfore he shouldnt be casting muck at blizz.  People in glass houses ....
---
Ok boomer
---
Oh don't get me wrong.  I've had fun as well up to this point.  I just think that ride has now come to an end.  Maybe I'm wrong but I doubt it.  I'm just going to play something else.  Not a life tragedy or anything.
---
At least they're removing the AP grind now
---
Some people have the worst UIs. I know some of that is just Twitch stuff but man what a cluttered mess.
---
I’m not gay but down to hang out
---
&gt; It literally is the same game without ganking.
---
Not even close to the same game if you remove the threat of pvp in level 20+ zones.
---
There's a reason why they never allowed people to character transfer from pve servers over to pvp servers back in the day (and they'll do the same in classic if they implement paid character transfer).  If it's "the same game you just don't get ganked" then why make that restriction?
---
Garotte isn't gonna last the full duration.  You should use ambush with a macro or cheap shot.  Stunlocking one mob in a group of 4 isn't gonna ruin the tanks rage gen at all, that's a total exaggeration. What it does do is help out with healer mana

&gt; I am new to WoW

&gt; omw to BRD
---
&gt; What are some suggestions you have
---
die as fast as you can to revive as fast as you can to go back to whatever you were doing.
---
like really, you're specced healer, you don't know what the other classes can do, and you're busy and going to a dg/raid. why bother fighting and giving the ganker the satisfaction of *outplaying* you.
---
Maybe I'm just spoiled, but on my server its crashed down to under 3G for a full stack
---
i agree
---
I'm reacting in part to my own disappointment with Blizzard. When I played on private servers the racist fucktards were everywhere and when people joked that they wouldn't play Classic because they were already getting Vanilla for free my take was that the 15 bucks a month would be worth it just to not have to experience the constant racism. But world chat is still full of toxic white supremacy comments.
---
Thats not factoring shower and eating.  It's semantics at this point but it's not that far off

Earthfury is balanced  I believe it's 49/50

Farming dungs over and over again isn't particularly funny for me. I'd rather done one dung 3-4 times max., and stick to questing. However should I try to farm the shit out of dungs?

wonderfully insightful comment. thank u!

ironically i have a lvl 40 pally on that server but was wondering if i should delete him and switch to horde just because, but meh maybe just make my new horde on another server?
---
thanks for the response! :)
---
Correct, no counter.
---
Upvoted for encouragement. Hang in there!
---
\- lvl 42 also
---
The LFG channel is being used efficiently. As a tank, generally I look for a healer first. Then I fill 3 DPS. I can get groups started at 2 or 3 in the am.
---
Think of it as the LFG meta: if tanks are often hard to find, tankless groups are less likely to even be LFM because people don't want to risk waiting for one.
---
Fairbanks sounds good for what you are looking for. Slight horde balance and feels super active for a server you don't hear much about. The first guild I joined the GM met up and gave me 15g :D so great playerbase here too
---
Start with disc Talents. You get Wanding, Mana reg/less Costs for instant casts, better shields and buffs and spirit at 40. After that you get your holy Talents. Its a Lot easier to start with disc talents If you Re wanna level as a healer.
---
Doing it like that makes questing a lot easier too If you wanna so solo stuff for a bit. Its slow but easier than with holy
---
No problem man! Good luck to ya out there
---
I was 29 for years. How good was the 49 brackets?
---
How would you rank the class/"spec"?
---
Sometimes it's so obvious that adding /s kinda ruins the post all together.
---
The Flask of Distilled Wisdom is always an option as healer and quite strong as well. 
---
Major Mage Blood Potion is added with ZG. At that point you'll want to use it as well as the Mana Oil.
---
Not until TBC when priests get Mass Dispel and warriors get Shattering Throw.
---
If you want to kill stuff, respec to shadow.
---
If you stay holy spec, you'll need to find some warrior or rogue bodyguards every time you leave town.
---
Spellcleave ZF :D
---
I believe Hinterlands and Feralas should be roughly in your level area. Searing Gorge is also a great zone to get about a level in.
---
After these 3 zones, Felwood and Ungoro Crater become your friends.
---
Hmm. Maybe if there was better leather healing gear we wouldn't need to roll on cloth.
---
Honestly before 60 just stack int/spirit and use r4 heal and r1 gheal, throw in Max rank renews, poh, pws and fheal as needed.  Bring water and/or mp5/spirit food.
---
E: meditation 3/3 is the biggest help for healing you can get.
---
man I call my wife a pleb thats a term of endearment. oblivious is just an accurate descriptor in this context if they aren't aware of dm solo farming they are oblivious and when you only think of a dungeon like dm as something you can do with a 5 man group it's cool to see someone do what should arguably be the "hardest" kind of run completely solo.
---
It's not particularly hard with a hunter but it's cool.
---
Damn
---
JUMP
---
I've built 5 pcs for my friends and myself. I gotta say my personal rig is almost 6 years old... but she is deffiently still a beast and runs anything I want. I've only had to replace a harddrive and a cpu cooler/fans recently. I will never buy a pre built rig cuz they are thrown together with the cheapest Chinese components and will not last as long. So I approve your message.
---
Well technically he was looking for wood.
---
You are the best tank and best dps in the game. You scale incredibly well with gear even in molten core. With a healer backing you in BGs you can demolish people. If that doesn’t entice you then try something else. 
---
Once you get your whirlwind and MS/BT you will pick the pace up a good bit.
---
You don't need a key to scout for Jed. You can target him if you just stand outside the door but since you will aggro like 10 mobs if you walk there you use the spyglass to "move" there and then /tar Jed to see if he is in the instance.
---
Skeram is Horde dominated. I've heard Horde on the server complain that they want to gank but it feels like bullying since the Alliance in the zones are surrounded by Horde who will join in if the Ally fights back.
---
You misappropriate Orwell's concept of doublespeak. Liberty is racist when your idea of liberty = the right to be a racist. I can't tell if you're sympathetic or just dim. After looking at your post history, it's clear you're both.
---
Lol my bad, you right.
---
Completely agree.
---
There's a LOT of players, myself included, who aren't really pvpers who play on pvp servers because of the added agency that everyone being pvp flagged in contested zones brings. 
---
I imagine STV on pve servers isn't even a special zone.  People go there to xp at level 28/30 and have no concept of it being a dangerous zone at all.
---
Meanwhile on PVP servers players are actively avoiding the zone until higher level specifically because they know they'll get ganked there a lot if they aren't high enough to defend themselves.
---
Imagine farming rich thorium veins on a pve server and some horde comes along and steals your vein 1 sec before you get there.  What can you do?  Clap?  On a pvp server this would be a fight to the death with higher than normal stakes because the winner gets the node....
---
These kinds of things are what make pvp servers great, and to say that pve servers are "the same game" is completely false.
---
I'm going to be that guy:
---
Benediction isn't a legendary!
---
dont call me friend. not friends with little bitches.
---
I recommend bears. Bear meat at least on my server sells for a pretty penny.
---

---
First time ever playing wow is classic. Played PvP server, level 60, 5 piece felheart set, I almost never ever loose 1v1s, couldn’t imagine playing on a boring ass lame PVE server, do not take this advice.
---
The main reason Warrior has a reputation for being a difficult class to play casually is because it is almost without argument the most gear dependent class in the game.
---
When your character sheet is lagging behind the level of the content that you are attempting you will feel like a useless scrub. The flip side of this is that when you have good gear in every slot you will feel like an unstoppable killing machine.
---
The same can be said for what playing a Warrior feels like solo vs in a group setting. Playing with a good Healer is a whole different ball game than playing alone.
---
There will be a large upfront time investment leveling and getting geared, but every goal you accomplish makes the next goal that much easier.
---
Warrior is also a deep class mechanically due to our resource being rage and not focus/mana. This is another hurdle that you will have to jump as a casual Warrior, but its the same as leveling/gearing in that you only have to jump it once.
---
Stat priority/ability rotation/preferred spec are all things you will want to know inside and out to be successful as a Warrior. Game knowledge goes a long way: especially if you want to tank, which you should (because DPS warriors are a dime a dozen).
---
It is a difficult class to play casually, but I'm sure it can be done.
---
As a grobbulus player since day 1, I couldnt be more stoked
---
The issue isn't the introduction of the honour system. It's the introduction of the honour system with no battlegrounds.
---
Zul farak all day. Uldaman has some cloth gear if your ally, just be ready to wipe on last boss.
---
Idk about this guy in particular but generally people have some world buffs going for raids. Dying before you get to the raid sucks big time
---
You spelled cum wrong.
---
Once you jumped over the corner, nothing would be the same again.
---
Yeah I was looking into Herod but I feel like over time less and less alliance will be on that server. I want something like 50/50 or 60/40 max I am thinking.
---
Tues for na wends for eu. Goto raid tab (press o) and click raid info.
---
There are no ratings, it's a RANK. So yea, if you want to be technical it's a RANK cap not an honor cap. Because I didnt take the time to unbundle the nuances of the system doesnt mean my point changes in any way whatsoever, nor doesn't mean I dont understand the system. People will be at the max rank very quickly because blizz put a cap on the rank you can achieve in phase 2 to avoid players having better loot than available in BWL.
---
The amount of rage you have over a reddit comment is pretty cool though
---
It sounds like you've never even played classic and are just salty that classic took player base from your theme park on rails
---
They are using the halfway time from joanas speed run actually
---
Lol! Really?
---
The best way to deal with aoe threat is to have good DPS who know how to manage threat. DPS should hold off until they see a target with a sunder or two on them. Unless you have two mages or something they should be able to aoe slow everything.
---
Also pulling a target at range then battleshouting near teammates and blood raging all produce threat.
---
It was 100% said. Many of the server forums had stickies BiS lists.
---
Every five days. So the schedule is wonky.
---
I play retail when I get bored of trying to find a group for dungeons in classic.  I miss LFG sometimes.
---
People are different. Someone else might have a completely different experience than yourself doing the exact same thing.
---
Also why are you even here if you've already quit playing?
---
Couldn't see if they had world buffs either, which would be really annoying.
---
I own an account where the sole character has the only purpose of camping the booty Bay auction house and snipe people like you. Repeat offenders get added to a friend list and /who is monitored when a few are online.
---
Tsm4 sniping feature with a custom operation is killer.
---
Everyone is on different paths. Some people don't hear that from family or friends
---
Have an upvote, and since phase 2 is coming, PREPARE TO DIE IN THE NAME OF SYLVANAS!
---
Very possible. 
---
I would attempt to get into SM cath dungeon grinds. Works best in a spell cleave set up (1 lock, 2 mages). Then when you get to 41 go to ZF and do it again. Its boring but effective. 
---
Other route would be to quest till your eyes bleed. I did a mix of the 2 when i was grinding to 60. Also, you can avoid the wpvp for the most part by just dungeon grinding it out to 60 as well.
---
Anyone know of an addon for tracking specific mats that You’re trying to collect? For example, I’m trying to get the mats for Healing Enchant and when a Living Essence or something that I need drops, I want to roll Need on it. Maybe something that when you scroll over adds a note or something
---
Bad healers too, a little communication goes along way.  I usually try to life tap during pulls for the healers mp5, but I'll occasionally life tap a couple times, then corpse eat (undead) and they pop their big heals on me anyways.
---
It's literally our big class feature, I'm not going to unbind it because healers can't communicate when they'd prefer you to do it, because we absolutely will use it.  We don't get the passive Regen other classes get.
---
You cant really do BRD at level 52. Even the most basic none spellcleave runs have level 56 mobs in them. Try finding groups at level 54/56 for it then you can do BRD. 
---
Also, BRD is shit exp. So for gaining exp you want to do quests anyway.
---
Warlocks, SPriests, Hunters and Shamans are a pain to deal with.
---
Onyxia resets every five days so it varies from week to week.
---
3/10 tbh. Not even mildly amused.
---
Same. First time in UBRS, didnt even know it was on my bis list. Meanwhile my friend has farmed for weeks and not gotten it.
---
You're literally taking money from an NPC.
---
Might be worth seeing if any of the places you can transfer to are heavily skewed toward your faction. That would help with the ganking.
---
I’ll be waiting for the YouTube series or montage video
---
Look, the healer doesn’t NEED to dump mana on the Lock unless the Lock is getting whacked by mobs. I will keep lifetapping if you keep healing me, especially if it’s a heal over time. If the healer stops healing me, I’ll lean on drain life, healthstone, and food/water. Healers shouldn’t blame me for their own mana management problems, I say. If I’m not in imminent danger, I can manage my own bars.
---
That said, I love them Druid HoTs!
---
He made it out of Orgrimmar!
---
Everybody understands this. 
---
If you're the kind of player who feels bad outnumbering enemies, ganking an enemy when they're low, or killing someone when they're fighting something minding their own business, then that person has much more to lose on a pvp server than they do to gain.
---
I am this kind of player and I'm currently on a pvp server. Very few things compare with the satisfaction of enacting revenge on someone who kicked you when you were down. Don't get me wrong, there is a lot of fun to be had on pvp servers, but unless you're the type to scumbag people whenever the opportunity arises, 4/5 "world pvp encounters" at least on my server of incendius are going to be instances of you getting ganked mid fight or jumped by people who outnumber you. 
---
Don't get me wrong, world pvp is intense and can sometimes present extremely interesting scenarios, but you have to take a lot of punches from cowards before you get the awesome encounters. And ironically, there are a whole lot of cowardly players on pvp servers
---
I remember enclave too. Bunch of shit players. They had that paladin that would use hand of edward the odd to insta-cap points in AB and AV, and in warsong they would exploit their flag carrier to unreachable locations.
---
I'd say I average about 0.8 water per pool. Got 3 from a single pool once which was the absolute jackpot, but generally it's slow and steady.
---
We are usually four hunters in our raids and we haven’t had a single binding!!!!
---
he's a white supremacist
---
We haven't done it this week so I can't check.
---
Yeah I know it's every 5 days but I was hoping for someone that is already locked out to tell me when it resets since I can't check
---
That's the worst part, getting past tin and iron...
---
So that he can tell others what no-lifers they are and so that he can feel a bit better.
---
Rolling need is considered pretty rude on crafting materials. Be sure to ask everyone in your group if thats ok before that. Living essences is cheap, but still ask.
---
This is the equivalent of stopping in the middle of the road and waiting for the car to hit you.
---
No, op is referring to the three 62 elites Horde need to kill for Ony attunement in SoS, Winterspring and Tanaris.
---
That’s all we ask, thanks!
---
So basically he's been bad at this game for 14 years?
---
It’s not a fear, it’s a fact.  If we don’t see major personnel changes at Blizzard soon, we’ll...we know we’re fucked.
---
Lol you not only got them back but you found their video on twitch and uploaded it to Reddit? You should have had the view from your side included as well.
---
I’ll go ahead and tell you that all these people leveling a warrior for the first time are terrible playing the class and that’s dps, ranking and PvP.  If you don’t have fun at 35 then you won’t at 60 the only think your missing is MS and axe talents. I don’t understand why we got this massive influx of warriors
---
Your assumption about pve servers is only correct on some servers. Some pve servers have very active pvp communities, and if you are looking for the challenge all you have to do is toggle yourself pvp and wait for someone to attack you
---
While your mount dramatically disintegrates and your pet treads water behind you, increasingly frustrated with your shit.
---
nailed it
---
found the racist
---
77 days is pretty standard for blizzard... Way too fast for vanilla. Probably great for retail, but there you get to max level in 2 days, not 2 months...
---
Without hypocrisy, one cannot already be 60 and have done it in a healthy way.
---
Zug zug!

How to farm x item as hunter: tribute and buy in the auction house.
---
except that it made a difference, and the people who aren't racist twats that play on grobb appreciate it. Gtfo
---
There were addons to let you do it vanilla
---
Make friends, quest in groups, communicate with your faction to rally local defenses. Don't forget that in vanilla, level differences matter less than in retail. Two lvl 30s might have a decent chance vs a lvl 40; or at least be able to escape using their CC.
---
Your dps doesn't matter if you are new. Why would they give one of the most sought after weapons to the new guy who may just leave next time he is pissed off?
---
This is both great and terrible advise...leveling a warrior is literal hell like some have mentioned, SOLO.  I have pulled out what little hair I have left for doing it again as my main 15 years later :) Grouping for dungeons or having a buddy who can toss a heal or 2 helps immensely while questing.
---
However, every class has its pros and cons, just remember that when/if re-rolling.  If you want to tank and have the most fun because the rotation is so intense, choose warrior.  If you want to tank (or possibly fill healer/dos role) but just swipe/consecrate, choose Druid/pally.
---
If you want to have great solo-ability, but have a “more difficult” time finding groups at max level, re-roll.  It’s not impossible to find groups, just not as easy as it is with playing a tank/healer.  I feel that there are a couple “Hell levels” that just make you put your head down and plow through (19, 35, 45, 50, 59).
---
Regardless, the point of a game is to have fun.  If you aren’t having fun, try something g else out.
---
You need some 👓
---
You spend far more time getting those buffs than they could ever save you and they're so unnecessary
---
They're BOP
---
In my world if you are the only person who can skin it, it belongs to you.  To hell with rolling.
---
Fucking yes it is.  We all work to 60, we all have repairs and costs, we all need gear n mounts, and the game was setup to work on a 5 player dynamic. 
---
Screw you greedy asses.
---
Clique is basically mouse over healing without macros, it’s incredibly efficient. Especially since you can bind different abilities to your hot bars on the same hotkeys you have bound for heals on clique. Sadly I haven’t seen clique on classic yet (tho I haven’t checked in like a month), so it’s mouse over macros taking up my hotbars.
---
If you can get to 60, you can make enough gold for a bis everything 19 twink in a week or two playing super casually.
---
non wow player here can someone please explain? i know he was camping a low level before but whats happening in the vid?
---
Yesterday as I was walking up to a mining node, an obvious bot Hunter was already mining it but, he wasn't looting it, just kneeling as if the bots inventory was full.... I proceeded to watch as a lvl 24 bear mauled him down as I cheered on the bear. That bear killed the bot dwarf Hunter and I got my node, good boy.
---
Go retail.  Seriously.   
---
If you don’t have fun doing the game to the point you need to screw people over to feel good about your time here, just GO AWAY.
---
im new to wow but not to the guild. i understand though
---
World buffs are pretty nice when speed clearing
---
I just tell explicitly only heal me if you can spare mana. It’s just one sentence to type. I like to not sit at 100% health. Demonic armor and life tap exist. Or death coil.
---
The point was *how* the money is made. You’re trying to equate things that aren’t similar. Selling a product is income. Embezzlement is income. But they are very different, and that’s the point.

So are you at an advantage for raiding compared to 3/5?

---
Good luck! Pro tip: have your melee stand max melee range. They might want to be right up in rag but thats a fast way to tank rag.  Max melee and if your tanks get knocked back have them call when its safe for melee to go back in. I found out the hard way. Rogues don’t last long tanking rag.
---
Hahaha holy shit imagine being this upset because a game is releasing content too fast for your slow ass
---
I’d tell you to go jump in front of traffic too but your blood pressure will let natural selection run it’s course eventually so you better level faster pal 🙂
---
Does he? I've seen ppl rage so so much more over one kill... All he did was slam imhis mouse not even that hard ... Or is there more rage after this clip?
---
Or blizz could balance out the servers.

Absolutely not.  Cho'Rush's Blade is a superior weapon.

I guess the extra proc from thrash blade is good but not that good.
---
Are you sure? I swear it was removed around the time between BWL and AQ. My mind could be playing tricks on me, but that's what I remember. I can't remember the NAME of the addon though, but it was packed into those raid addons that "everyone" used. CT something I think?
---
Spirit of aquamentas is just fine for me lol.
---
didn't know that was there thanks! Looks like it's Wednesday
---
Then pay for my healers time too.   I have to buy water and regrants, plus my times worth something and 75% of the runs I’m in have no upgrades or 1% drops, so I deserve to rip people off too, right?
---
In fact, why don’t you give me everything you get plus another 10g because I’m basically your personal servant in a run and you owe me more for it.
---
That’s it. You’ve peaked. You can uninstall now.
---
Yeah Blizzard would have had it in day 1 if it were ready.
---
&gt;Yeah that's not how it is on pvp servers at all. You seem to be very confused.
---
Rather than getting all patronizing about it, it'd really be nicer if you engaged with my arguments. The example I provided were literally my last two BRD runs.
---
I play on a PvP server myself, I enjoy the thrill of feeling vulnerable in a contested zone. I agree that PvP servers are more rewarding and breed more player agency. I enjoyed the fuck out of my time on a pvp server with all the fights, that were stacked in enemies favour, stacked in my favour, the (very rare) fair fights, the times where I helped the opposite faction and they helped me.
---
Except, we're in a thread about a casual player leaving wow because they do not have the time or the energy to deal with that. You're saying that pve servers do not provide the real wow experience, and the said casual player should just dungeon grind one dungeon for x levels, then rinse and repeat. And then what? Just dungeon grind some more at max lvl because the situation will not be any better then, especially with honor releasing? Is that really rewarding and player agency breeding and greatness achieving? Is spamming SM really more of a wow experience than undisturbed questing out in the world?
---
Yourself? The only thing more pathetic than you missing the irony here is you and your defense of racism.
---
Top right, under your minimap you have a counter for guild and friends online.. what addon is that? Will it work with sexy map (currently using a black square like yours)
---
On topic, serves him right. Looks like hes stuck in a loop - blizzards auto detect shouldve detected this guy by now.
---
Yeah, it’s called watching the screen.
---
I have a bartender 1 slot bar for my mount that’s away from everything else - when out of combat he stops being greyd out.
---
A paladin or shaman might want it. \~50g probably.
---
60/40 is going to seem a lot worse in Phase 2. I would recommend Earthfury. It seems like there are slightly more Alliance there now but I expect a lot fewer ally to be interested in honor ranking.
---
Sure, if you need them. lol

Not for AoE.

#looks fine to me
---
A 'pull' is a term to describe a fight between you and an enemy mob (or group of mobs), basically.
---
As melee, there are essentially two types of pulls; going up to the mob, or having it come to you.
---
Going up to the mob is the simplest and fastest for melee, but is sometimes dangerous due to terrain or   
---
 there being other nearby enemies that would also aggro if you were to run into melee range of the initial mob.
---
Having the mob come to you is useful if you are ranged and they are melee, as it gives you time to hit them when they can't hit back. If both you and the mob are melee, this is only useful in the above situation where running to them is dangerous. However, if you are melee and the mob is ranged, whilst also being near other mobs, you must bring the mob to you by 'line of sighting' it if you want to be able to attack it back. Obviously, the mob can only attack something it can see (line of sight), and since you have LoS'd it by ducking behind a nearby pillar, it must come to you to resume attacking you.  
---
It's just a variant of having a mob come to you that is very useful for sketchy areas. Tanks do this A LOT in dungeons when the pack has ranged mobs in it, but it can also be used to cancel enemy  - mob or player - spell casts.
---
Made a similar post regarding this many months ago.
---
It feels rewarding to you, but others may not feel the same. Taking on more risk does not necessary mean it WILL BE more rewarding to them. Risk averse people exists in this world.
---
Here's a \*sample\* breakdown of how carebears (e.g. my gf) feel about PvP servers, and what she would probably be saying.
---
i) Killing a similar/higher leveled player = +2 "fun". (Nice. Now let's continue on our journey.)
---
ii) Killing a lower leveled player = +0 "fun" (How is killing this poor newbie fun? I'm just wasting his time)
---
iii) Seeking lowbies to kill = -2 "fun". (Why would i want to waste my time doing something so lame? I could be questing, leveling, doing dungeons or just farming herbs)
---
iv) Escaping from a world PvP = -1 "fun". (What a waste of time trying to escape. Now i have to wait for that ass to get away so i can go back to my original path)
---
v) Engaging in epic world group PvPs = +5 "fun" (Cool fights, nice show)
---
vi) Dying in PvP = -500 "fun" (Now to spend 2mins running back to my corpse. Such a waste of my time)
---
vii) Getting corpse-camped = -10000 "fun" (What a waste of my money, paying to get camped and not being able to enjoy my questing/leveling/farming process)
---
Edited: Anyways, perhaps you should play a modified version of russian roulette using a die. 6 chances. Rolling 1 = Losing a finger. Rolling 2 = Losing an eye. Rolling 3 = Losing an ear. Rolling 4 = Losing a toe. Rolling 5 and 6 = you win a hundred dollars. Compared to playing a dice game that rewards you a dollar no matter what you roll, playing this dice game is definitely more rewarding. Wowsie! You risk a body part and you get a higher reward of $100!!!! You can enjoy your high risk dice game while i can enjoy my safe risk-less dice game. That absolute quantifiable reward of $100 is definitely higher, but the "unquantifiable" reward is actually negative for me.

This is vanilla the difference between sucking and not sucking is how many buffs you come to raid with. If you can't do the mechanics you don't suck you're mentally deficient
---
Any ideology that divides people by genetics is about the same in my book.
---
I was thinking the same thing.
---
&gt;needing world buffs to clear this content
---
Because people like you would cry about it if they did. I have a 60 on PvE and PVP. I assure you there's barely a difference in gameplay.

There are definitely one or two ledges from which you can aggro mobs from the floor below. It was the same in vanilla and still there in retail. You just have to be careful near ledges.  I’ve never heard of someone really aggroing through the floor.

It does affect people pre 60 as they are going to be gankes for honor by 60s.
---
So that is pretty invalid.
---
Looks like little Payo ofc
---
quickly realizing that theres a lot more racist WoW players/redditors than I thought. this entire post is scary
---
just bring as many as you can find, 5 man works, 20 man works
---
Hi-5.
---
Migrated to PvE server 2months back. She's now enjoying the game way more and looks forward to ending work everyday so she could do dungeons and stuffs with me.
---
Bold move referencing the show where the lead gave up 70 million dollars because he felt idiots were taking the wrong message from his jokes. Guess you're one of those idiots
---
Remulos, come and say hello :P
---
They probably were stream sniping.
---
Not hard at all but it’s more efficient to down stuff faster.
---
Ah gutted I’m Mograine man could’ve hunted some ally down ;)
---
Leveling tips:
---
Up to lvl 40 I was spamming sunder armor ONLY. Well.. I charge, rend, THEN spammed sunder armor. If they dodged, I Overpower'd.
---
After 40 I would stack 3 sunder armor stacks, then use mortal strike. I made sure to run dungeons to have good gear but WW axe lasted long.
---
The thing with sunder spam is that you at least get some character animations, AND  heroic strike takes -12 rage.   Sunder armor does -15 + your hit which nets you more rage when the mob is dead.
---
I calculates how many swings it would take to kill my enemies and if I could do it in less than 3 hits, I auto attacked, bandaged and engaged another foe, NOW WITH 3 HITS WORTH OF RAGE!
---
Your average player is going to fall in the range between 10 and 14 days played to 60.
---
If you rely on a crit heal to save a raid, you aren’t raiding right.
---
watch this video to get a better understanding of the honorsystem,  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFbX5drsnAw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFbX5drsnAw)  
---
its kind of a basic-advanced system guide by staysafe
---
As long as you're using Evasion or stuns to avoid taking a lot of damage you're good
---
Keep leveling! The reward is worth it. Warriors being super gear dependent means you do little now but will be crazy good once you got the higher end of things. 
---
And sure, 42 may be the halfway point XP wise to 60, but soon you’ll be high enough to tank Sunken Temple, then BRD, and eventually Scholomance and Strathome. 
---
You will gain so much so and gear from those runs, the last portion of leveling can fly by, especially if you’re in a guild that can help make that load a little lighter.
---
I’d tell you to not focus on professions unless it’s gathering herbs and ore alone the way.
---
Edit: grammar
---
To the people saying they're catering to hardcore. If 10% of guilds have mc on farm right now, that number will be 5% for bwl after two months. Maybe 1% for AQ. Naxx progression will bankrupt most players and their guilds, giving them a reason to play. What this means is that phase 1 is only this short because of how trivial the content is. Anyone who expects all phases to be released at this pace is a moron
---
Missed the "Go back to faerlina, we dont want your kind here."
---
How is the alliance / horde ratio on sulfuras?
---
For a Pre-Bis'd hunter what is better? \[Ogre Forged Hauberk\] or \[Tombstone Breastplate\]?

---
Depending on how many runs it takes they can get more than 15G, since i assume you mean a flat number and not each run.
---
Can confirm. Am useless druid.
---
Exactly. A random internet stranger doesn't always grasp the emotion or intent behind what you are doing, but it doesn't make it any less genuine. 
---
I think these things are much more noticeable in person, when you see those people that tell everybody they see to have a "blessed day" with a giant smile on their face. 
---
Those people warm my heart.
---
You dont need tons of int gear for ap rets in p1.  I have only crown of destruction that gives int, and i still dont ru out of mana on rag when popping mana pots, demonic runes and max consecrates
---
You have discovered the paladin's signature PvP move.
---
Phases DO NOT need to be rushed.  This schedule is complete bullshit as is.
---
Oh I just mean specifically for the pom frostbolt part of the cycle. Would it be more damage than a frostbolt even when spec'd frost?
---
I think you gotta use a backslash before stuff like that \#showtooltip
---
You will clear the content faster with buffs than without. I'm not sure what you mean.
---
the thing is , the poster was way more offensive than me and he is still posting and i was banned for F them and he was like ( braindead blizzard keep lying to us etc.. ) i mean ... lets be honest lol he deserves it more than me lol
---
Hang in there brother. At lvl 36 you'll get whirlwind which is just like a mini MS. This is your first true instant attack and it will make your leveling so much better. At 40 you'll get MS and your life will be forever changed. Stick with it for 4 more levels.
---
It is known.
---
Boo hoo
---
Blizzard: “In WoW classic we will have our retail improved bot detection technology TM so we won’t have as many gold sellers and will not need as much staff to handle it.”
---
Ouch
---
I’d go 3/5 if you’re also planning to pvp. While raiding you’ll be mostly casting shadowbolt, which isn’t affected by Suppression
---
They said they aren't.
---
It might be that it got nerfed with the release of DM. Seeing how DME jump runs open up a ton of Thorium picks.
---
Top tier post
---
CT raid assist?  If it was the same update that killed the old one button decursive add on then it wasn't until way later, it made chromagus so easy.
---
If I remember correctly it's never been allowed to xfer PvP &gt; PvE, even when paid.
---
Makes me glad I rolled on a PvE server.
---
Also jump right before entering dungeon instance.
---
I'm a hunter and I don't get the "need on everything". I only want stuff that has hit until I'm capped (which I can just buy warmonger off AH and switch to that for bosses that are skull-level). The crit stuff is obvious hunter gear. Anything else would just be very high agility stuff, which if it's just an agility thing with no crit or hit, it's probably BoE and I can just buy it off the auction house.
---
I've never ran into issues on needing.
---
People are just so stupid and are min maxing this game for no reason but to drive a toxic wedge in a community. YOU WIPE BECAUSE YOU FUCK UP, NOT BECAUSE YOUR LEGS ARE + 15 INT AND NOT + 18. YOU LOSE THE PVP BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T DO THE RIGHT MOVES, NOT BECAUSE YOUR PET IS 1.2 ATTACK SPEED RATHER THAN 1.0. FOR FUCK'S SAKE!!!
---
Elkano buffbar should do that for you
---
DME jump runs. You get 3 RTV every run. Gives you a ton of thorium. Prices are at 20 silver for a piece of thorium on my server.
---
I wish subs were cheaper so i could do that🙏🙏
---
Except you don’t screw anyone over if you announce it beforehand,
---
The only reason to drop gnomish engineering is to avoid the hassle of giving mats to your guildmate/friend/some rando (with a tip if it's a rando) to craft goblin explosives for you. There is no benefit to learning goblin other than that.
---
Any engineer can use goblin explosives, but only goblin engineers can craft them.
---
So yes, it's a bit of a hassle to send mats to your guildmate to get him to craft, but it's also a hassle (and costs a certain amount of gold) to unlearn engineering and re-level it. Just depends on what you'd prefer.
---
  Zul Farrak doing the graves gives you tons of xp, but you need good AOE clear.  Any group can do graves but it’s much easier with a mage.  The stairs after are also really good for xp.
---
True!
---
*sweats nervously*
---
Oh always. Been at this rogue thing for a long time. I just went from thinking I was different to realizing I was a basic bitch in .5 seconds.
---
There’s a twink only guild horde side on blaum - forgot the name but they advertise a lot on trade chat and /world chat
---
JUSTICE FOR CHINGCHONGS REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Very useful for pvp, not useful for pve except in rare cases for kiting
---
Incendius is a blast! It is also at least slightly horde dominated. Stable economy, healthy world chat and LFG etc. we’re definitely a nearly full pvp server, so plenty of people to play with, and plenty of noobs to gank
---
Not sure if a meme or serious.  That is the state of this game.  But if serious - stop.
---
When I do ubrs we usually have 3-4 people who get there first look for him and use their instance as we build the group/all get there. Haven’t done a full ubrs without him in it. Also If you or someone you know has key you only need five people to do Jed/rend runs. 1 healer 1 tank 3 dps are more than suitable. Only need a second tank for trash before drak and drak himself.
---
She is the best
---
The content is easy, so the real challenge (for some players) is dps rankings or speedruns.
---
World buffs are necessary to do those things well.
---
I have to admit as a rogue i cant resist breaking a sheep just to fuck with the mages
---
&gt;call out dirt bags
---
&gt;But the congressman is calling out blizzard... 
---
I mean...
---
all those people that say this are the type of people that turned the game to retail. have you not yet realized everything they complain about on forums/sub is fucking bullshit? forums will always be filled with the whiniest shitheads of any games playerbase.
---
I have a cat set and a tank set, yes. There’s not much overlap between what stats bear and cat wants.
---
Because people care about meters and leaderboards. Those that don't generally won't be in top guilds aiming to race for naxx progression in the first place.
---
Oh yeah?! Holy shit I didn't realized getting a guy banned from a videogame solved the evils of racism!!! This is the best news ever, i cant believe how much of a difference it made. Modern day Rosa Parks right?
---
Level 40 was a milestone for me. There was no more skills to unlock in my build, i've got my mount, all i had was repeating same shit till 60 so i deleted that char and didn't buy a sub for the next month.
---
Yarp. That I am.
---
Sending in the warrior first as a decoy tab target so the mages can go guns blazing. 200 IQ
---
Locks are fine aslong as they have first aid but if they are the ones who life tap and expect you to full heal them whilst also keeping up 4 others then I just let them die and when they complain I just tell them its their own fault for not first aiding.
---
Just focus on agility. Literally nothing else. 
---
If you're struggling and wearing agility gear, you're not struggling because your gear isn't efficient enough.
---
It's honestly not that complex. This level of thought is only needed for raiding or for certain other classes.
---
U mad bro?
---
Benediction was roughly 50/50 before Blizzard broke the APIs for census addons. Lately I feel like it's starting to tip in Horde's favour though. I'm kind of worried about the snowball effect of Alliance players quitting/transferring and the arrival of phase 2.
---
Is there one for shadow and discipline?
---
I think it’s more to do with the fact that all the bad players now play mages due to them being stupidly easy to play and level.
---
So, F the dagger+orb and get the staff instead?
---
+5 fishing glove enchant
---
You don’t need anything but  your pet, send him in scatter shot and then feign death
---
I did all 3 with 6 and 5 on final dragon
---
Yes hello. I was curious if there was a self help book based around this event that I could purchase? Bonus points if it’s hardback and the dust jacket doubles as a poster with a screenshot of that image.
---
1-3 is possible in 1 week, 4-5 maybe in  the second week, but from 6 upwards it's 1 rank a  week maximum, and for most players will be 1 rank in several weeks.  above rank 11 it gets reaaaaaaalllyyy slow.   multiple months.
---
What's wrong with the French word for red?
---
&gt;But I was a noob at lv50 and vendored the Nat Pagle +25 fishing pole
---
Use item restoration to restore it.

Just hit LVL 59 on my warrior. What dungeons should I farm for best leveling and gearing?

---
Haha nice
---
I dont even complain. I like the game like it is. I choose Classic over Retail. Everyone said you should take your time for classic, but now I read things like I shouldn't play PVP when Im slow. I dont know what happend...
---
To make things clear, it is totally okay for me that Phase 2 comes out even if it will get harder for me. But I dont understand the new mentality of the community.
---
Good lord. Let’s not walk down the same roads that lead to cliffs twice.
---
Completely anecdotal, but it feels pretty balanced.
---
Yeah that seems fine. I was puging before my 60 a week before DM came out.
---
possible world buffs that make this raid much easier than italready is
---
Mirage Raceway EU
---
&lt;Keepers of Stromgarde&gt;....My old nemesis from TBC!
---
Yeah, shes basically a creators pet of the writers. They really like their undead waifu.
---
Well said. The gear police are out in force lately. They are the mean girls of WoW. Ewwwww are you wearing Nike’s? Everyone knows Addidas are BiS you should be embarrassed.
---
you check item restoration that blizz offers? just to see if the rod you vendored is there. Just google wow item restoration.
---
People still get in trouble for using the "ok" symbol with their hands. Even when they use it the same way it's been used for decades, it's somehow racist now. I don't get it, frens.
---
Nobody did except for the ninja.
---
Honestly I do this occasionally if there is a caster/healer type of mob up and skull isn't on it. Rogues can usually keep them locked down and they tend to be squishier than other mobs so it's not even a hassle to kill them quickly by myself.
---
Man in classic people die so fast in PvP.
---
Deja Classic Stats
---
As a healer, I rarely see locks go below 50% from life tap unless the pull is over. 
---
But then again I'm also the sort of healer to always give locks a low rank renew after they life tap and bubble them before big pulls so they can go ham with hellfire.
---
its not there anymore, this was like a month ago. maybe i can put in support ticket?
---
Woops
---
Nice
---
You don't need a spyglass, you just stand by the left stairs leading to the seal of ascension door. If you have a macro with /tar jed you will target him in the first 15 seconds and get another chance for that 15 second interval every 2 minutes. If you're too slow you will know because the 2 pats you have to wait for will have walked up and down the other side of those stairs.
---
It also sets an expiration timer on your ignores... like if people are being annoying in trade chat... arguing about politics or something, you can ignore them for a week... or a day.
---
I'm Searching now. I'm sure there is.
---
I think I spelled Calrouge perfectly! haha
---
Its because tanks and healers usually build their own groups. At least in my exp
---
I mean isnt the entirety of PoE a ripoff of diablo 2?
---
Nvm, this was the most cringest shit ive seen. Thanks
---
Why does this hit so close to home?

I've only had a few interactions with Horrigan and they were all in 2006-2008, so I can't speak for how he is nowadays. But they were not always just out to be nasty and mean. He was helpful and friendly the few times I spoke with him. The human (and draenei) thing was more for RP purposes and to be unique than anything else.
---
But that was also a long time ago, so maybe he's changed. I imagine playing WoW for that long really takes a toll on a person.
---
Tanks are at a disadvantage. Its harder for zhem to farm, its really hard to tank raids, they need full defense gear and cant roll on dps gear without getting shit. On top of that people need a tank to do the dungeon, but dont give a shit about him. 1 stack sunder armour? Guess ill ambush!
---
He even called it nicely. You can now decide between "yeah its alright" and "sorry, not gonna happen", you get a "np, gl" in return and keep looking another 30min for a tank.
---
Im not a tank btw.
---
Honestly, he ticked me off so I just tried to get under his skin. It's petty af, but you'll think about doing it when someone robs you from the chance of getting a blue BOE.
---
its not a new mentality. these are the same type of ppl that drove the game to the state retail is in. they suck at the game.
---
Please explain. I’m a fan of the lore up until the end of Lich King, and maybe because it has been 11 years but I can’t remember any glaring retcons from War3.
---
Really? That’s great. I keep hearing 7-8 days and I’m at 7 days 47. 10-14 days feels way more realistic. I’m following level guides but also doing dungeons, cooking, etc so not going super fast. But I felt way behind.
---
Depends normally I'm playing Thursday &amp; Sunday for raids and either Monday or Saturday casual around 18/19:00
---
Sweet justice

---
Downvotes 😂 you guys are still sad
---
I *really* don't think you know what "edgy" means. lmao
---
Mages are gunna go oom all the time, doesnt matter if 2 mobs or 6. But thats why they have mana jades, evocation and potions. If a mage charges for food and water in group, kick them they are a bad person
---
Just make sure that dungeon isn't in blackrock mountain or it might take a while to get in.
---
She's also always been a fan favorite. I don't know if she existed before WC3 but from then on people have absolutely loved her, not just the writers. She's an interesting character.
---
Go ahead, after one sheep, not the mages problem anymore

---
I hope you realize no one thinks youre funny. I hope you feel embarrassed with that post. Cause you should be.

This is really funny. Except the thing about mages. That is 100% true.

IDK what that is
---
Grobbulus is the server for all the yuppies.

30g an hour if youre good at it
---
BRD arena/angerforge runs should be easy to find, UBRS jed/rend runs also will drop gear you want. LBRS probably has some stuff but I'm not sure. 
---
You can look up your best in slot items online, or use a resource like wowhead to find individual items to make your own build
---
That was my goal, honestly. Ninjas deserve to get provoked.
---
So how do you heal if you're using your mouse to steer or move camera?
---
The halfway point of XP would not be equal to time as you get more xp from things at level 50 than at level 5
---
Also you only get 1 rep per kill, atleast that's what i'm currently getting.
---
Is that a thing? Like do people have leaderboards?
---
taxation is theft
---
Hypnotic Blade + Orb of Dar'Orahil is the best you can get at that lvl range. That being said, as the previous comments also stated, nothing is really worth to explicitly "farm" for it at that stage during leveling.
---
Ofc if you are not sick of Library and it still gives you good XP you can try, but otherwise don't waste too much time on it.
---
Hello fellow VeCo player! I remember him on the realm forums. Dude was a total assclown. And yes, &lt;The Enclave&gt; were ridiculously horrible at PVP.
---
Which are a part of your free time.
---
Could do Maraudon once or twice to get some quests done
---
It's no different from normal healing where you would select a frame then press a heal. It just reduces it from the click and press to just a press.
---
As a L21 warlock that wants to start dungeons, what do warlocks do that’s irritating and how can I avoid being a dick?
---
Yes, most of the time it was a chill ride. At most I died 2 times.
---
And the boat leaves the dock and fades away in the distance
---
been doing this on the run from a port to org -&gt; wind rider, if you don't jump over that steep angle connecting the little bridge to land you're a pussy
---
And I'm just going by what it was actually like in vanilla.
---
You can try. likely wont get anything other than Blizz saying we can't confirm you had this. Happened when i was inebriated a little too much and sold Whirlwind weapon along with some other gear. none of the items that were a weapon slot item were available to be restored. They said they can't confirm I ever had it or did the quest. Which is some bullshit!!! I still have the item you get (a parchment or some crap) from completing the quest chain.
---
I’m speaking from experience, been playing there since server released and i’d say its 45-55 alliance.
---
Im sure they do. It would take a quest writer. A CPL weeks to make a few hundred of these
---
Because it is open world PvP. If you don't make sure you are safe, it is your problem.
---
The best part is he was a part of the problem he is mocking.
---
Sounds like you let me in, but OK.
---
pfff that's not the real Lich King.  I'm glad he got owned
---
Guy from your village runned to me to show this post. I can die happy now.
---
The PvP already existed. The only difference is that you now get points for it. People who wanted to gank could already do it beforehand.
---
And... How's mana situation in boss fights?
---
No way! What a journey he must have took. I'm glad this news reached you!
---
My dwarf paladin handled this area with no issues.
---
Which MC bosses should I use Free Action Potion on to maximize my DPS?
---
Gehennas, Sulfuron, Garr, Golemagg, Lucifron
---
anyone else?
---
Not rolling on strenght items.
---
Love that you only challenged the "edgy" part.
---
And some, like me, are well aware were average but still enjoy doing the most i can to bridge the gapas much as possible. Which isnt Hard on classic, but I loath ed in retail
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/server/id/5035
---
for my server
---
Why didn't you just go on wowhead?
---
I'll take it if it fucks enclave.
---
Because he’s new?
---
Ranks also have a minimum requirement of points. It is well known that the amount of points you can farm in the next few months without Battleground will not be enough to even reach the minimum required to get to higher ranks.
---
You can’t call people idiots. Alt right racists call people idiots all the time. Apologize for your problematic language.
---
And then you go to a vendor to see if you have something to sell while waiting for the next ship.  P.S. ofc you don't as you already did that before...
---
Do yourself a favor and get e gineering to 260 for dense dynamite. Its super cheap and generates a good amount of snap threat on a pull.
---
Pretty sure the only one in my guild went to a lock.
---
As a mage, though, it’s the single biggest potential upgrade for me in p1/2
---
I am embarrassed to join as cat dps because I'm terrible.
---
Yes. I feel ashamed now, going to edit it
---
old mouseover macros could be used like /cast \[target=mouseover\] Flash Heal;
---
A good rogue never opens with cheap shot unless in pvp
---
As a tank I hate mages. 
---
As someone who’s best friend is a healer. I hate locks lol
---
Okay. So what's stopping the Ret from using Seal of Righteousness? All of their talents (Vengeance, 2H Weapon Specialization, etc) still boost the damage of their attacks far more than anything in Holy or Protection.
---
Why would we not consider the implications to freedom of speech when getting involved in deciding what is "online radicalization" ?
---
Imagine being this dishonest and moving the goal posts in an argument where you're the asshole. "Pal". Lmfao. Please hang yourself.
---
I guess it is simply explained by the fact that I'm non native too
---
There's a vanish cloak too :).
---
But I meant the trinket, yes.
---
You tab out, find something interesting online...tab back in only to watch the boat fade away again
---
Nah I'm not, but I appreciate it
---
You sound like you're an asshole in real life
---
i like the giant ability icons with a football field between each row. guaranteed this guy is a clicker.
---
How would you know what locks are doing you moron. 
---
You’re the lock in your group. 
---
I’m the one that has to deal with the revolving door of idiots like you lol
---
Makes me very happy to know that some country is cares enough about animals to consider socially isolating them animal abuse! &lt;3
---
Lmao how did this happen
---
Baaaaaat shit crazy man.
---
No, it's just that I sometimes see sentences that don't make sense to me but they're gramatically correctly written.
---
I remember one saying "How he is not kill" and it just doesn't make sense to me
---
I'm using it just fine on classic.
---
It would help if the encounter wasn’t bugged.
---
Good thing we had a 3 month marketing beta 🙂
---
Atleast get one character to 60 so you don’t miss out. Especially if you haven’t played vanilla before.   
---
The end game content is really fun so hope you get there.
---
Fear is so busted man. It gets me stuck in things all the time and I have to hearth
---
I liked BC PVP better. It was still pretty bursty but almost all classes had more defensive abilities to play with.
---
So many rules. Next you're going to tell me I have to start jumping into instance portals.
---
Underated comment
---
I've never charged for a portal either.. tipping for a service is a hell of alot different then charging for it! I fully support tipping a mage/lock/rogue/profession for there ability to craft or something helping you out.. demanding it as a payment on the other hand. And it hasn't been that long since I played retail and it still wasn't widely accepted on any of the 3 servers I've played since launch
---
I love it
---
Ιs Destruction warlock good for leveling/
---
Yes, but with a spyglass it's foolproof and faster since you can target him at any point in his patrol
---
I have pretty limited knowledge on the current game but from what I gather she is kind of bad. Not full blown evil like Arthas but she’s just willing to do anything to accomplish her vision for the world whatever that is.
---
You need to get a threat meter. 
---
Checkout skarm tank on YouTube. 
---
It sounds like you literally have no reason to be fury prot other than you want to try it. 
---
Furyprot is a build used to generate massive amounts of threat so that top tier DPS can play their class to its fullest potential. If you dont have geared rogues and warriors showing up with full world buffs and consumes, pushing meters as hard as possible, there isn’t really a reason for fury prot.
---
Arms is the best DPS/Tanking spec for dungeons
---
Thank you. It works!!
---
No, just saying how they found out the exact time they were going to be there and clip it.
---
Says the paly LOL. I bet you like boys.
---
What's the exp/hr? I'm currently 53 (almost 54) and trying to figure out my best leveling options now
---
Nice nice. It's still password gated right now, so once you log off you can't get back into it. People made like world2 and global and other shit to try and make up for it for now.
---
It's real easy to nail it when i used to be one.
---
Anyone at all interested in retail announcements... Be very interesting to see if people jump back across
---
Have you even read the post?
---
This is the kind of stuff Classic was supposed to be about. People not caring about talents etc etc
---
Just goes to show can't escape the mindset of today
---
Not all bugs are bad
---
I mean, his tweet is the embodiment of "boomer". Perhaps you are one too.
---
&gt;Instead, I find myself asking how this can exist in one of your games.
---
The answer to this question: This can exist in their games because the option to create black characters exist, and because there exist white clothes. As long as those options exist, anybody can go in and take a screen shot like this.
---
"Scary"
---
AHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
ya man if youre a rogue at 60 give it a shot. watch some vids of people doing it ahead of time to take all their advice and stuff. youll be fine.
---
The real enemy is The Enclave
---
You don't *need* world buffs, but if it knocks off an hour of raid time or more by having them I'd rather do that, personally.
---
Thanks for updating your question with the solution.  A lot of people who say "I will update when.." or "When I get home, I will update.." rarely do.  People who update their posts are awesome.  Keep it up. :)
---
I don't know, people randomly downvote. I mean I also got downvoted apparently.
---
Yeah but most of our melees are not very good. We are still searching for officers who will take lead on the melees and NSA them a bit. I do it for the healers and we have two people doing it for the ranged, but our melee leading is severely lacking.
---
Imagine fabricating an idea in your head based off of nothing and then believing it.
---
Lol so fucked
---
Find like minded individuals and you can still do that.
---
"My son is confused as to why other people call me Daddy too."
---
I hate when people try to mark targets and lead the group etc if I tank. Please don’t do that in my runs.
---
Edit: tanking is hard enough with randoms and if you take the lead from me and start marking etc It’s harder to predict how the pulls etc will happen and that will make the dungeons harder for everyone
---
he made a real mess in there too. 15 silk cloth is enough to make multiple shirts.
---
It doesn't have to be in the same line/cast, but that works too (and honestly looks cleaner). Your macro didn't do what you wanted it to, because of the order. It first tries to Viper Sting your mouseover. If that doesn't work, it tries to Viper Sting your target. That works, so it will never get to the next line that mentions Serpent Sting.
---
If you switch the order to this:  
---
    /cast [mod:shift,@mouseover,exists]Serpent Sting;[mod:shift]Serpent Sting    
---
    /cast [@mouseover,exists]Viper Sting;Viper Sting  
---
then it will first try to Serpent Sting your mouseover if you hold down Shift. If that doesn't work, it will try to Serpent Sting your target if you hold down Shift. If that doesn't work, it will try to Viper Sting your mouseover. If that doesn't work, it will try to Viper Sting your target.
---
Any other way you want to back yourself in a corner so you don’t have to admit you’re wrong?
---
Nah. I like logging in for an hour or two and just messing around for a bit. Get my mind off things and relax.
---
Where do you get these masks?
---
I thought demo spam was patched?
---
Original vanilla healbot would:
---
1. Show you which person to heal
---
2. Automatically select the correct healing spell for it.
---
It was literally just clicking the same button again and again and you would automatically heal with the correctly downranked spell on the correct target.
---
One button dispelling/decursing was definitely removed during vanilla. Was probably later part but still vanilla because I remember our guild joking that we'd start wiping in MC because mages and priests wouldn't be able to just spam button to dispell/decurse.
---
Often, before a raid, the party will receive a ‘world buff’ 
---
There are many different kinds, but for example, when someone hands in Onyxia’s head, everyone in Orgrimmar receives ‘warlords blessing’ 
---
An organised raid will get 2 or 3 of these buff sometimes then head over, if you’re all dead, you lots your 1-2 hour prep time getting the world buffs
---
Maybe you live in a snow-globe of magic where companies design games for fun and have no interest in profits. But in the real world all of these developers had financial goals to hit and board of directors to answer to.
---
 The business model of subscription based MMOs requires players to have long-form content. The limitations of dev teams only allow so much content to be produced per "expansion." If players (as we've seen in classic) can rush through content there is significantly less chance they will stick around and continue to pay a subscription.
---
There's no compelling reason that in Vanilla it takes 10+ days /played for someone to hit level cap other than it being a time-sink that Blizzard gets paid on. The slow level progression of EQ or the skill grind of Ultima Online was no different.
---
Oh now you’re deleting your posts 
---
What a pussy lol
---
Im a hunter. I dont even bother engaging pallies.
---
?
---
I'm level zero due to an injury (pinched nerve) I'm just now getting over. So I knew phase 2 would come before I hit 60, or even 50, but damn, I wish it wasn't this early. I'm not even going to get to participate in it before battlegrounds kills it all.
---
imagine thinking you're a better player for not getting buffs 
---
so braindead holy moly
---
There were even way more powerful addons aviable back in March 2005. They were just so insane that they have been banned since.
---
some translation from their comms before the clip starts:
---
\-- while they are running towards BRM
---
???         : hey barexx this is your fault
---
barexx : why?
---
???         : n s f l (*name of our pvp raidlead*), some of you know him right?
---
barexx : ohh noo.
---
???        : he (*nsfl*) is standing in the middle and the rest is left and right behind the wall.
---
???^(2)       : then they want to kill us. we cant try to get around them.
---
???^(3)          : its the guild "Neuzeit" (*thats us*)
---
barexx : yes yes, they are known. **we know them from duskwood**. ( *when they were camping lowies*)
---
\-- while they are gathering and rebuffing in front of BRM entrance
---
???^(3)          : they also know when we are coming. there is 100% a spy in the stream
---
barexx : if thats the case hes such a poor little sausage, this person. **he should please hang himself upside down in his basement.**
---
Hey guys! I had a few of you reach out to me after finding my self-help book on Amazon! For anyone also interested, my book is based around my past extensive experiences dealing with cringe and whispers like this. If you’d like to learn how to empower yourself, AND learn to move on after these traumatic experiences, feel free to check out my book at the link below!
---
[“I Whispered Back” (Amazon #1 pick “Self Help Books”)](https://youtu.be/oHg5SJYRHA0)
---
Yeah I would never watch a stream where the content is like less than 50 percent of the screen.
---
You're confusing descriptive and prescriptive.
---
&gt;the whole idea of classic and vanilla is to get gear, and thn create your own content,
---
According to you perhaps but Wow is so many things to so many different people. To assume we all enjoy it the same way is foolish. If you want to *actually* be objective there are a few metrics we can measure.
---
For example there are 41 classic servers across all regions. Of those 29 are pvp servers, that is 70% of all classic servers are pvp focused.
---
Currently there are 0 pvp mechanics in the game. I play wow for the PVP. Raids are cool and all but hey happen once a week and the loot is random whereas pvp is rewards preparation and decision making.
---
People asking for more content aren't 
---
&gt; always on the grind for new raids, dungeons
---
We simply want the mechanics that we signed up for to finally exist in the game again. This is also different than begging for new content or for them to cater to us. We know literally everything about classic and arbitrarily holding back things people want for the sake of keeping classic 'alive' longer is senseless. The end game content in classic without pvp is almost non-existent. Battlegrounds don't some how prevent you from doing 'your thing' but they allow me to do 'my thing'.
---
This picture is fantastic.  It's a work of art, actually.  Why isn't this up-voted to heaven?
---
For the Halloween event, you can go to the innkeepers and trick or treat with them. If you get a treat bag, there's a chance the masks will be inside them. They only last for a week though.
---
Drain life is extremely mana efficient though. Currently its about 300 mana and i can easily get back 500 health even with my dogshit gear.
---
I thought it was funny. u/whoslappedthepie is trolling you though.  That said, tabbing back in to find a wall of whispers from a random stranger who takes your kindness for granted IS annoying.
---
   People are probably trolling you here because they don't feel that something like this is worth posting, since there are socially unaware idiots everywhere you go, especially in MMO's.
---
There are always going to be people that are less talented as others or less considerate of others.   This is normal human nature.    I have no problem ignoring the shiters but I never can understand why people come on Reddit just to bitch.    Practice makes perfect and it seems to me that everyone now is practicing to be a perfect fuking complainer.
---
That makes a lot more sense, yeah I really wanted to try it out in raids, but if it’s viable it would make farming during non raid days a lot easier as well. From a raiding perspective I don’t think we have a need for it yet! I actually have been watching a ton of Skarm tank and just subbed to his discord haha
---
From just the trailer alone, not at all. More sylvannas and Bolvar being defeated by a rock? Extremely underwhelming. For the record though I haven’t followed the story since cata. Will wait for gameplay info.
---
No you daft fuck, they chose those names specifically to give off an innocent first-impression.
---
Also, 'liberty' as in: we should be allowed to be racist pieces of shit.
---
Not sure that will happen. I used to play PvP back in retail and loved it. But 14 years ago I had so many free hours (single, in my 20's, college) now I'm a casual at best and made a PvE character and it's great for me. I would suggest just make the jump now. If your worried about leveling roll a hunter and get up fast.
---
Username checks out
---
Was he saying f them? Dude was probably trollin and you took it too far
---
The art of the deal.
---
I was in a small cabin fighting 2 mobs the other day and feared one. He ran through the back wall of the cabin and pulled 3 more mobs. I obviously died. I was pissed.
---
Some people don't want the annoyance of pvp. I just want to log on and decompress for an hour or two.
---
If something is rewarding for *you*, then that's fabulous. But you aren't everybody, and different people find different things enjoyable.
---
Also darkmoon fair reputation turn in items
---
Herrigan was finally banned.  After near 15 years of this shit.
---
I'd say the congressman actually taking the time to weigh in resulted in something should've been done 15 years ago.
---
Do you log your fights? I compare my raiders to other raiders in the world. The only difference in my raiders and the top is performance and consumables. I even outgear some of the top rogues. If you log and upload them to warcraft logs there is a replay feature and you can watch what each member of the team does including spells used. It only tracks consumables used during the fight though.
---
Yes and no. The question isnt can you win under geared vs an over geared player, because absolutely you can. The question should be how often can you win under geared vs over geared. Survey says not that often. To me its akin to people bragging they made you pop a potion to survive an attempted gank.
---
But Druid is back!
---
For replying? That would be reddits notification system alerting me that you replied, and me replying back. 
---
It's refered to as a "conversation" in the business. 
---
Shift clicking and checking where someone is, then whispering them after you've already ignored them, that is rent free stuff right there, my guy.
---
FASTTTERRRRRRRRRRRR STRONGGGGGEEEEERRRRRRRR
---
&gt; Leveling on a pvp server is more rewarding, because it has more risk. This is a fact.
---
No, that is an opinion. Your opinion. Not some universal truth.
---
The guy you replied to has more fun on a pve server. That's also his opinion.
---
Pro tip, if your arent a shit healer most locks actually have a stack or two of drinks to give non shit healers during runs. So dont suck and youll get more drinks than your dumbass came to the dungeon with along with a ss and I even offer a healthstone and free summons from going to repair if doing back to back runs. Learn to play your role
---
Hands down ogre-forged hauberk.  20 agility is worth crit and AP, plus all of the stam and int is nice too.  It's not really even a toss up, the hauberk is better.
---
I don’t think it matters. Blizzard doesn’t like that you used “f them”
---
Dungeoning is the only way to level on this server. Black rock mountian takes at least 4 deaths to get to entrance of BRD and then you gotta make one more death walk to get into the instance. It's a shit show.
---
If the locks are at 10-20% they’re doing it wrong and deserve to be cloven a-twain!
---
The thing is, those white supremacist guilds chose Grobbulus just because they thought it’d be more fun to rile up roleplayers than regular PvPers. It’s not anything more about Grobbulus that attracts these people.
---
Engineering ****
---
&gt;If a mage charges for food and water in group, kick them they are a bad person
---
As a mage main I agree
---
I watched a bot farming elementals in borean tundra for all of wotlk.  Many many reports. Blizz no fucks given. But I did get temp ban for complaining about Oculus in the forums.
---
How should they advertise it since you get the 120 boost right now? Would be kind of wierd if it said level 50 boost.
---
I also tried running directx 11 instead of dx 12, no difference.
---
Bad gnomes get sent to the time out corner
---
It's really sad that WoW is what makes you a tough guy. Like, that's the thing you're going to hang your hat on?
---
Yeah. It's all his own fault if he gets sniped.
---
Why do we need a classic panel? There is nothing to talk about, beside phase two comes out. What do we need more?
---
As a warlock life tapping + bandaging or consuming corpse if undead is faster than drinking by almost a 2 to 1 margin. Good warlocks wont wait for the healer to heal them though.
---
Only time i really sit and drink/eat is after a wipe.
---
I understand that. But at the same time it’s the empathetic  intent behind it that matters, and the fact that someone out there received that message in the right headspace. Posting it on Reddit however is a whole other can of worms lmao
---
Is he acting pissed? He is obviously disappointed because it's going to waste time. But he doesn't seem to get as pissed off as people say, he laughs at something someone posted in chat a little after.
---
I've been farming that epic 1h book from Diremaul since it's been released. Do you how many dps warriors genuinely get butthurt and rage at me when I tell them that the book is on res and I don't invite. Yeah I'm gonna invite some fuck who plays the best tanking class but is too lazy to do so, so he'd rather join MY GROUP, THAT I'M TANKING, AND PUT TOGETHER, AND THEN NINJA THE ITEM IM AFTER. The drop rate is already nonexistent and now you gotta worry about fucking dps, who always complain about there not being enough tanks, ninja'ing the item made for tanks.
---
But 98% of the playerbase doesn't care about speedruns. They care about efficiency overall and getting the buff isn't efficient.
---
As a lock i dont even have any raid gear yet because we dont even want our t1 for pve and with a dkp system and 4 locks i can get it all for free if i get it last or it goes to a rolloff if no one bids on it, ill take it then for pvp. All i want is the t2, talisman of ephemeral power, mageblade, ring of spell power and choker of the fire lord. Most of which I have to compete against all the mages for.
---
So are they rushing classic now so its over before the new retail expansion releases? Seems like a horrible idea.
---
Or you have a really shallow understanding of love, human emotion, and some people's capacity for it. 
---
There's also a much deeper meaning to being "in love" with someone and just loving them. 
---
I very genuinely feel sorry for you if you don't understand where OP is coming from.
---
WoW doesn’t have any mechanics to promote territory fighting (a lot of newer games have tried to figure out how to do this—with varied success), so you can tell from the get-go that a 3rd factor (beyond PvE and PvP) needs to be introduced for that to happen. In this case, it’s the roleplay factor.
---
That’s why I always wondered why RP-PvP has not in the past been more popular. It’s basically a server that has *more* to do because people make content and bring the world more alive.
---
If a mage ever charges you for food / water in a group kick them and find someone else. I have never ever seen a mage try that ever though
---
I can’t decide which is more cringe, the hollow “I love you” to internet strangers or you actually screencapping it and posting it on reddit for even more hollow upvotes.
---
What constitutes a perfect warlock? Level 21, and I want to do dungeons without being a dick
---
But getting 5 mages mageblades will shave a second or two off of each mob, and more off of the bosses. Getting 5 paladins mageblades won't reduce wipes if you don't have any. And besides, those extra seconds mean that paladins can pop bigger heals before going oom.
---
More damage makes healing easier, and healing won't improve performance once you're doing the encounters.
---
It's not that fair to healers, obviously. But we shouldn't conflate giving healers loot to increase fairness and giving healers loot to optimize raid performance.
---
I'm generally in favor of a certain amount of giving suboptimal loot allocation for fairness. But that doesn't mean that it's in anyway "as good" to give a healer a weapon as it is to give one to a dps.
---
Good. Fuk
---
Apparently it's included in the Details! Damage meter addon if my memory serves
---
Warlock &gt;pala&gt;mage repeat
---
While Staff of dominion goes to mage&gt;druid&gt;priest
---
What's a good classic NA server? looking for somewhere that feels like home, everyone knowing everyone etc but also having progressed guilds and skilled players a place to be social and make friends but also progress at the game and not feel held back or lonely
---
It’s not bugged, it just requires an OT for phase 1 and a good MT that can manage threat well for phase 1 through 3.
---
I’m the MT in my guild and we one-shot her every time with 0 deaths, no potions required.
---
Oh yeah boost is available immediately. Forgot that detail lol
---
yeah that one! thanks!!
---
I would guess that's a connectivity difference between WiFi and Ethernet, faster up/download speeds
---
So, i raid currently and can say with my head hanging low - that i have lost every roll on witchblade i have seen so i am still using this dagger. I hate it. My gear looks great until you see my weapon. 
---
In your case - its well worth it. The only other options you will see for better are the sword from Mara and the Witchbalde which both are quite a ways off for your level.
---
Not really. Gather in orgrimmar in 2 seconds for guildie to turn in onyxia head then hearth to kargath. How is that a long time?
---
Also if u wanna raid smaller raids like 2 25man in the same guild then world buff helps a lot.
---
If you are playing as little as you are, you should stick to one character. Its already gonna be hard for you to have competitive gear as is. When p2 comes out you wanna be pvping non stop, and ideally that means you should have all of your non raid dungeon gear taken care of so you dont have to waste time not pvping to get it anymore
---
Makes sense! Cool thanks for the detail. I'm just leveling blizzard spec right now so I dont really know the ins and outs of min maxing (yet?)
---
It does seem like some of the cheapest shit I've ever seen, buy some water and drink like the rest of us.
---
Oh I agree. Mageblade is far superior. I was just arguing a technicality. Technically, there is another weapon paladins can use. It's just worse in every way lol
---
I would wait because its better for casters.  How our guild does it, is casters get prio for mageblade, nefs mace is prio for pallies
---
I was running maraudon at your level as Arms without issue, you’d be fine in there.
---
Azshara, northeastern coastline
---
 The other day I was questing in a cave and saw a random warlock so I invited her to party. She declined the invite, but what I thought was really nice was she whispered me to say that she was finished with the quest. Definitley wasn't needed, but it was nice that she made the effort.
---
And we have the right to ignore those demands and look for a normal dude.
---
If you have the Details damage meter and so does the dude you inspect it will show their talents to the right of their Character sheet.
---
Next year there will be a classic + panel.
---
What add-on are you using for the casting bar? Looks very nice.
---
 My complaint is that Blizzard isn't doing enough to prevent WoW from being a safe space for racists. The fact that Blizzard didn't notice this was going on in their own game before this congresscritter complained is hardly evidence that I'm wrong.
---
Im all for charging randos making me spend a minute making them food/water then drinking, but in group that's their role.
---
Same goes for rogues, you in a group and theres a locked chest? Everyone rolls, not just your greedy ass
---
Yeah I agree with that
---
Yup, it's fuckin shite mate
---
I think they meant being like... A warrior or shaman who doesnt have outright buffs to give unless you are partied.
---
They should be allowed to.
---
Who cares, christ. Let idiots be idiots.
---
It was the other way around
---
imo it will be - free action pots, limited invuln. pots, flasks for raiders come phase 3 etc.
---
Wir haben Streamer auf Dragon's Call xD
---
Vielleicht hast du die Gilde &lt;CH&gt; schon gesehn :p
---
Not sure if sluts are an accomplishment, but having a best in slut weapon will certainly help!
---
I can often go through an entire dungeon without drinking thanks to ~~life~~ spirit* tap, when I'm with a good group. Sounds crazy? I am.
---
Christ judging by your reaction to a simple comment  you really do need those classes lmao
---
It's really looking like you are putting effort into downplaying solidarity because it makes you feel good.
---
Pretty lazy and selfish tbh.
---
Esports ruined video games. People don’t play for fun anymore, it’s all about competition.
---
I'm all for some pvp, but the second you camp low levels that can't fight back, you deserve any sort of retribution that comes your way.
---
The first part endless whining about Rogue, Mage, Priest. The second part whining about Druid and double Rogue with mace specialization (which got heavily nerfed) or the final part with either 2 resto druid setup for 50+ minute games or Druid, Hunter, Warrior.
---
Bold move to say it out loud in a gaming sub, but I agree.
---
2h opener with sweeping strikes and whirlwind would do the trick.
---
Should I go gnomish or goblin?
---
I tap constantly and rarely buy water...but with demon armor, first aid, and food... Alongside with the 3 different heal spells I don't expect to be a priority for my healers and usually will say something like "don't waste your mana on me." I'm used to not being 100% hp... Thought that came with the territory but tapping down past 30-50% usually isn't a good idea... Mana conservation seems to be key...ofc I never played retail though, so it's all new to me!
---
From what I understand you go 10-50 in any expansion.
---
I mean common practice is to save the head from your own onyxia kill and turn it in before MC raid. Even if you have to keep it in ur bags for a while.
---
Please God do not make a post explaining why hunters should take the lead and mark targets.
---
You will not replace that dagger until scholomance witchblade
---
"I see in your resume you describe yourself as a risk taker. Could you give me an example?"
---
"Well you see..."
---
Well, why would one particular game affect the PSU? (Im not disagreeing with you, my knowledge is sub par with this kinda stuff. I just can't get my head around why).
---
Upvoted for use of the word "fortnight."
---
We should bring it back.
---
Are you changing professions for another BiS?
---
Enchanting can make good $$$ for tips so keeping it might be a good idea
---
Yea my server free action potions were like 20s and literally overnight they went to 11g for a stack of 5. And the fish are just as much
---
It is also one of the better ways to get gold as a prot specced character
---
Lol this fucking noob clicks his stance button..
---
It is theoretically possible for paladins to tank raid bosses. And with the recent discovery of spamming GBoK for threat trick, they can focus their gearing entirely on mitigation, which is good because they have the lowest mitigation of all the tanks. A paladin had 3 weaknesses: 1) Sustainability.  GBoK spam is sustainable(ish) so that's solved. 2) Lack of a taunt. Can't fix this, but not technically required for a majority of the fights in the game. 3) Mitigation. Let's dig into this one.
---
First, a paladin can't easily become crit immune with shield block like a warrior, so they need to achieve 440 defense. Difficult, but achievable. Then that leaves crushing blows, the true barrier to Paladin tanking. In order to avoid crushing blows, you need a combined block+dodge+parry+miss of 102.4% or greater (druids avoid this by having tons of armor and health. Harder on healers, but not that much harder). 
---
440 defense gives 22.4% avoidance+block. Holy shield is another 30%. Deflection is 5%. And base avoidance and block another 20%. That gives us 77.4%. 25% short. You would need to get 25% more avoidance+block to become crushing blow immune.
---
Possible? Probably not. If paladins could equip warrior tier sets, then maybe. But as it stands, i don't think there's enough tank gear that paladins can equip to hit 102.4%. Feel free to prove me wrong, though.
---
Lol k
---
I do miss arena matches...
---
Gearing a warrior, the pre-raid BiS gear is not bad to start for PvP but as others have mentioned the thing you're looking for is Stam + crit chance for burst damage.
---
For a hunter in a PvP sense, your biggest advantage is going to be your ability to kite and knowing how to manage your "dead zone". Mages and other spellcaster classes know that if they get to roughly 8 yards they will be too close for you to shoot and too far for you to melee and then stay there. Think of ways you would manage that in wpvp. 
---
For BGs it's always going to be about finding the best way to play the objective, I love farming HKs as much as the next guy but especially if you're alliance you're going to have to think of ways you can contribute to a team win.
---
* WSG-Semi decent flag carrier with cheetah and also can put traps on your own flag for defense. 
---
* AB-tracking stealth for ninja caps, traps on flags for defense, general harass
---
* AV-Boss DPS, Traps for defense (And in boss rooms)
---
Another aspect of PvP for hunters is pet choice, obviously first and foremost pick a pet you like to see and use because you need to enjoy yourself, but from a Min-Maxing point there are pets better than others; Brokentooth for Auto-attack speed, vultures for stuns etc.
---
Covered in dots "I'm in danger."  So good
---
Imagine being this dense 😂
---
Any best zones/routes for Mithril? Badlands is eh
---
Are you like a sociopath or psychopath?  How can you just not have any empathy for the 4 real people generously waiting around for you and not let them know whats up.
---
I'll try to break it down to avoid confusion, but on all my toons I haven't had dungeon drama loot once yet.   
---
&gt;So you also accept that warrior tanks can roll on purely dps item  
---
Yes  
---
&gt;yet you seem to imply that paladins can't.  
---
No. I'm implying a Paladin heals needs to tell Warrior Tank his rolling on DPS gear for transparency/etiquette, if rolls are 100% or 50%. Paladin tanking with 3 casters is also under same circumstance expected to get the drop, and the 2nd Paladin should notify if his rolling on DPS.  
---
Like it's not that hard, all you need to do is ask!  
---
&gt;to be honest, pally dps are probably less invited than warrior dps, so that's even more of a forced option  
---
You're not wrong
---
I'm gonna give these steps a go as there are some things in your reply that I haven't tried.
---
Thanks for the suggestions friend!
---
This guy embodies everything I hate about some streamers. Whiney, entitled and the aids music. I mean wtf is he listening to.
---
You do jump runs with warr?
---
Ive never done it tbh im waiting for my warr friend to get to 60. It does need mining and herb right? Whats the gph?
---
There won’t be much changes stop freaking and  just be more aware and stay away from zones like STV that are known for PVP during high traffic times.
---
His UI indicates he clicks his spells
---
He was already dead
---
The congressman got them banned in 24 hours by raising the profile of the issue.
---
Obviously it hasn't solved racism, but it has stopped them from using WoW as a forum to promote their vile views. I bet that's more than you've ever done.
---
Sounds like your goal is to just experience the game and have fun doing it - yes phase 2 will likely feature more skirmishes, but i could still imagine people in the 30 and 40 ranges still running past each other because starting a fight will ultimately slow down their leveling speed and likely attract the attention of a big fish to come gank em if they take it too far.
---
Some people will kill on sight any opposite faction member they see, that will not change with p2 coming out, and if everyone is so terrified of leveling lowbie characters, it means there will be less people around to start fights, and in the end, you might not even feel a difference.
---
If the game becomes unbearable to play, then that's unfortunate, but till then, just play as you always have since i assume you have fun playing.
---
Sounds like you're the guy who got triggered if you had to delete your comments 😂
---
This. I am levelling a paladin and before I need on anything for a roll I'm not currently playing, I just ask the clothy, the warrior, etc if they need. Not stealing shields from the tank or cloth int gear from mages just seems pretty common sense to me. Sadly, some people are just selfish assholes.
---
I need two items and I can get to 9% hit and 21% crit unbuffed but they are seemingly hard to get. Just grinding crystals till I get my epic mount atm
---
Shit yup you're right. Blizz didn't wan't PvE to have the freedom of leveling and farming then xferring.
---
I'd take a druid tank over a warrior 9/10 times given how warrior players have zero fuckin chill.
---
Oh BTW, my add ons are through twitch and you say maybe this has some kind of interference? So would it be better to delete them and get them elsewhere or just disable/enable once logged in?
---
I'd like to play retail as I'd rather experience new content rather than old content.  Despite the old content being vastly superior and the new content being questionable at best.  I'd still rather a new story than one I already know.
---
I watched some of the previews for Shadowlands and it seems like Blizzard is somewhat listening to the playerbase from a marketing standpoint but completely missing the point otherwise.
---
They claim this isn't just a new continent to explore.  Calling it a new dimension or whatever while technically not a continent is still the same issue, with each X-Pac being a self contained region completely independent from the rest of the game you need to wait through a loading screen to get to.
---
No AP grind, but unlockable and upgradeable capes.  Sounds extremely suspicious.  
---
Obviously I am going to wait and see but so far nothing I have seen tells me that Blizzard has learnt anything other than what to say to its player base at BlizzCon to get them to cheer.  
---
Still sounds like personal loot is the way they are going.  Mob scaling to completely homogenize the entire game experience so you are spending what Blizzard considers to be the correct amount of time per mob, regardless of which mob you are fighting looks to still be a thing.  
---
Modern day wow just has too many mechanics that make the game world unappealing and bland.
---
why would they delay bwl, dmf, and av?
---
Minor speed on the main boots, keep a second pair with mithril spurs for mount
---
Lol. Clearly I’m trying to assess whether it’s humanoid or not. In my post I even say flamewaker, I obviously know they’re flamewakers.
---
Do you have any hard proof they’re humanoid? Because I’ve googled extensively the Classic DBs and there doesn’t appear to be any
---
who cares? the honor system was supposed to be out in WoW from its launch but it wasn't finished yet. the vast majority of players in vanilla bought the game after "phase 2" anyways and were absolutely fine. dire maul is literally just an extra option... people will bitch about anything.
---
chad gamers use default UI, bonus points for 0 addons whatsoever
---
you're arguing with someone taking a non-empathetic, judgmental stance. idk how far you kept on but I'd probably just cut your losses if you haven't. Thanks for taking the open-minded stance.
---
Think that boe is the butcher
---
Gathermate2. It only marks nodes you actually have mined from tho. You can import other people's data but I don't like to do that because some people took data from before classic. I like to know 100% I've mined it there before it gets logged. Every node I have is from classic and I've personally hit. I do keep a little notebook of nodes that other people have gotten or if someone calls it out in chat.
---
If you're up for the work it certainly wouldn't hurt. I personally am taking the lazy man's way and waiting for Twitch/Blizzard to get on the same page with updates XD.
---
Yes! Grey mobs don't give any exp, but quests give extremely small amounts.
---
I never said they'd delay phase 3. I'm saying that I bet that they're going to release wsg earlier than phase 3. Just like how Dire Maul was released earlier than phase 2. Sorry I thought that was clear in the title.
---
I have been playing Blizzard games my entire life. From Warcraft 1, and Warcraft 2 when I was a kid. To shit loads of Diablo 2 and Starcraft Brood War in my teenage years. And many many hours of Starcraft 2 throughout all three of its expansion packs. I played WoW from its original beta testing through the end of WotLK. 
---
Believe me when I tell you, Blizzard has been in the business of making highly addictive video games from the very beginning. And no one did it better than them.
---
It's not hard and it's not cool.
---
if you're on a peak server, i've noticed that if you log in at peak times (late friday/saturday night Central/Eastern)--you'll get an option to server transfer
---
I believe 5.3 is the same thing as needing 6 anyway. I don't think the game rounds down in this regard.
---
I love it mate cause everyone's salty and it doesn't matter at all. Like watching someone chase pigeons at the park.
---
Considering the response so far to this post, I feel completely justified in declining invitations to tank.
---
There's no one thing that a person can do end racism. That's a ludicrously high bar.
---
Lock here, when I life tap a couple times after combat that means I'm about to sit down to eat and drink. 99% of times the healer will jump up and instantly heal me, wasting my food and his drink.
---
They hit like babies until they enrage
---
My Guildie got one last week
---
Imagine taking a video game seriously and using emojis. lmao
---
Is it Nope nope?
---
one of their leaders got called out for a white supremacist halloween costume (in server) and appears to have been banned and the guild has disbanded to create two new guilds, Loyalty and Liberty, which names make it very clear they support the banned guy and his racist ideals
---
Me too 🙁
---
Yeah any info on what I need to do to hide? Havent figured it out yet
---
They run this sub broseph.
---
they'd be a stupid company if they did.  no reason to put a negative spin on it when you'll eat up the positive spin and be grateful.
---
The buffs are a complete waste of time for the casual or even semi hardcore guilds. The people clearing mc in 45 mins don't wipe and get full benefit of those buffs.
---
Ah shitty luck. I’ve vendored it probably 10 times and done the run maybe 20 or 30 times.
---
You can get miks scrolling combat text, it will differentiate it I think. I have got thrash or HoJ yet, but it tells me when SS procs.
---
Didn’t say competitiveness didn’t exist, but now that ninja has shown you can make millions/year by being good everyone wants to do that — and developers are making games with that in mind. Everything has timed trials, leaderboards, ranking, etc.
---
Yeah idk why people hate this so much. If you aren't taking enough damage to syphon heals, maximizing your dps, and reducing damage and aoe threat the tank has to worry about, why is this bad? I think people are mostly just no fun
---
It looks like the Tank in OP's photo joined the party, and then asked for payment.   So that is more what I'm speaking about.
---
Nobody has to speak a rule so obvious.
---
Why heroic strike? I took that off my action bar in the 20s. It doesn’t generate rage. Against single target, I just spam sunder until overpower/execute procs. 
---
It’s even faster to pull 2 pop berserker/bloodrage, then sweeping strikes then whirlwind.
---
I’ve been thinking about trying alliance since I’ve been playing horde for a while now. Is priest considered the more fun leveling class compared to paladin? Or is ttk just much slower as a paladin?
---
Literally never seen a Mage charge for water or ports in a dungeon group.
---
Yeah.. I got told "why would you reserve an item worth 300g everyone needs gold dont you know"
---
Lock your blizzard raid frames m8
---
Wondering about any particular one? The hardest one was the one at the very end where I had to use a ledge to get time to bandage up and hp pot and then kite it back on top while fighting.
---
no, casuals ruined video games
---
games were skill heavy or time heavy or both. We've gone from quake to overwatch.
---
You can reserve it, and since youre establishing the rules beforehand  there is no issue obviously , but consider that youre going to find it difficult to find most who are ok with that. On most servers is a 600g+ item. On my server it goes for 800g. Try running with guildies
---
Yh mate, I wouldn't join if you're reserving that. On my server in pretty much any group, if an epic boe drops, all need. I don't trust randoms to actually equip it, and I'm not stupid enough to allow myself open to ninjas.
---
Paladins kind of have an answer to everything. There are a few classes who might have it easier, but honestly other than me I only see Rogues mining in this cave. I have a shit ton of trinkets tho to help me mine.
---
It’s actually 18% crit unbuffed that u need .
---
Yup mentally unstable
---
ill take that into consideration thanks lmao
---
It would be cool if they tied this expansion to classic considering is on people’s minds now. I meant the expansion could tie in classic more not classic changing at all. I mean the live game could have more classic references because people will get it now.
---
that feel when **you** actually got *wooshed*
---
He had to roll holy pally 😭😭
---
Just doin the first three and sayter packs?
---
“It’s so hilarious that these pugs don’t magically know the fight and want to experience it organically instead of looking it up on YouTube”
---
You are everything that’s wrong with modern gaming culture.
---
Can you not read ???
---
I had a warlock in ZF leave because I wouldn't heal him over 50%. Like dude. I'm a ret paladin in int gear, I don't have Mana for your ass.
---
Oh okay so it was just speculation, I thought you were saying actual information.
---
Priest is more involved than a pally as you're casting more spells, but a lot of it is caring then wanding the mobs to death. Both are pretty fun to play imo
---
Thanks, good advice. I’ve used heroic for dumping rage.   
---
Sounds like it will be faster yeah.   
---
Which buttons have you bound changing stances too?
---
I'm only 48 so no idea on the top end but it's been extremely even for me. When I was in STVietnam it kept going back and forth on who was holding Nessy and the main troll camps. Tanaris is entirely Ally controlled. Everyday there's Ally abusing the dead zones in gadgetzan and camping ZF entrance. Overall Ive had fun as a horde.
---
Honestly, people overblow it. Ya'll behave as if everyone was level 60 back then when the honor system was released. There is no need to be level 60 for it either. Sure leveling becomes a bit harder, but the game does not become impossible all of a sudden for everyone who is below level 60.
---
Feels kind of half assed. Surprised it wasn’t canned altogether.
---
This is correct. It's one of the middle buttons on the upper right icon panel.
---
Current segment
---
Overall
---
Are the two options.
---
Maybe he had fun doing this
---
Despite all the memes about other classes there is actual a worst spec in the game when it comes to dungeons who manages to avoid all criticism.  DPS Shadow Priests.
---
They can range from either being the worst of the three DPS, barely doing higher damage than a tank using a shield and only pure threat generating skills, to starting to do a little bit of real DPS but stealing all the aggro even from the top DPS who is doing 50-100% more damage than them.
---
The worst part is I don't like being mean to people and I don't know how to say no to them.  I usually give them a "promise me you know exactly how much threat you generate and you won't steal threat before the rogue", that usually gets rid of most them but some are a bit more persistent.  I've tried to give the persistent ones with good answers a chance but they've all consistently been bad (through no fault of their own I assume, the spec is just impossibe imo).
---
Sulfuras has been pretty great so far imo. I'm alliance and there's plenty of people doing everything currently. Lots of friendly people on every server though probably
---
well i dont want a server full of toxicity is what im saying. im also saying i dont want something so low pop and braindead it's a lost cause.
---
Because when you do things that take hours you want to do it with people with a similar approach to the game.
---
Bg don’t come with honor system they come p3
---
I was looking at both and the pally buffs looked neat but didn’t know if it was auto attack everything to death if solo playing.
---
Lol did you just respond to my calling a post lazy with “no, u r”. 
---
You guys are so desperate to feel good about yourselves you’re hallucinating that there was some defense of racism you’re arguing against.  Man I should just start inventing easy things to disagree with too it sounds fun!
---
Just the hour long cooldowns.
---
I wasn't able to to do both on the same bind, the shift modifier should be possible. I'm not sure how it needs to be written though.
---
Favorite about to be dead dead character*
---
Okay, this does not explain the dozens of end game hunters who haven't named it. And naming it literally does not increase ur attatchment. If u have a pet for 10 levels or 50 i see no reason to not name it unless the reason is you just don't care about ur pets name. But again, kinda silly to play a pet based class and never bother with it. All cosmetic sure, but no one has told me a decent reason as to why hunters aren't naming their pets very often if at all
---
Eh, I feel like the game isn't balanced pre-endgame and still won't be after this. Its still really easy to do quests and pve and that'll be the same so.... it'll be just the same, just different numbers.
---
Yeah but as a rogue in a fight you can wear em down, get 4 combo points, gouge for a fifth, death ray/eviscerate mmm feels good
---
From a German player..
---
Sorry, my other pet is name Jean-Roger.
---
After my original guild shut down I did get invited to one that was anti-color and anti-lgbt, so there's that I suppose. I don't remember the name though cause I left it pretty quick. It was kinda funny. I was tempted to ask "you do realize you invited a bisexual don't you?" but not worth it. 
---
Also looks like they're (Enclave) hardcore brigading in attempts to avoid people recognizing what has happened lol
---
...really?
---
Garrosh is appointed warchief commits war crime by nuking theramor and corrupting the sha heart thing only to eventually taken down by a combined alliance and horde army, only to escape and become 1 of the leaders of a demon orc army.
---
Slyvannas is appointed warchief, commits war crime by burning darnassus down, eventually confronted by a combined alliance/horde army, escapes, becomes leader of the lich king army. 
---
Yeah i could see where youd think the only thing they have in common is being warchief /rolls eyes
---
You're fine. Plenty of people either aren't 60 or they're leveling alts
---
Thank you for being an unprompted example of what I’m talking about.
---
Plenty of tanks out there like marking targets, like explaining boss strategies, like telling others how they can improve, like finding out what the party has in their toolkit, and like knowing every pull in the entire instance along multiple different routes. Many of us picked the tank role precisely because they are expected to lead groups.
---
I feel like you are pretty new to tanking or you don't really like tanking all that much beyond the benefits of being sought after. Group leading is pretty low on the list of reasons why PUGs can't find tanks or why tanks won't tank for PUGs.
---
I just added to my post I meant the live game could have more nods to classic lore because people are more familiar with classic now. Classic would stay the same.
---
we play WoW, we’re all sad bro. You included
---
Bingo. I'm sure most people have rosy memories of vanilla World PvP, but I played on private servers where it was the only option. I can tell you, without my nostalgia goggles on, that it fucking sucked. It was lots of Rogues killing you inside of a CC chain, people killing you midcombat just before you could finish off the quest mob you needed, and having five horde corpse camp you because you managed to kill one. World PvP is not fair, or honorable. It's just bullying. The good PvP comes from Battlegrounds, which I think Blizz should absolutely try and increase the timeline to get out. I wouldn't even be opposed to them giving us WSG a bit early, same as what they did for DM.
---
I’ve missed this girls stupidity so much.
---
People have always checked talents and silently judged others. That's what I missed most about the talent system tbh. You used to be able to look at a guy and occasionally know ahead of time if they were absolute garbage at the game.
---
As a warrior tank who isnt all that confident in their ability, rogues that do this are my favorite people.
---
Thank god it’s up high...otherwise it would probably be all sticky and stained
---
Re: Everything
---
-	Target Discipline - that makes sense. Hellfire seems dangerous anyways!
---
-	Dying: I’m a good sport about dying in general. I never tap below 60% unless I just rezzed so I should probably be fine.
---
-	Healing: I never expect to be healed. This will probably be easier if I don’t aggro everything. But eat/drink &gt; lifetap will probably be less irritating between pulls.
---
-	Soulstones: yeah, healer getting soul stone seems ideal. I can’t do much after a wipe with a self-rez... and neither can the tank...
---
Just some followup q’s:
---
1.	Should I use all my dots on the primary target or does that generate too much threat?
---
2.	To clarify, is it ever worth dotting any secondary targets? I don’t imagine corruption on damaged targets will ever matter too much. Mostly asking for when I start caring about Nightfall procs.
---
2.	Which minion? Blueberry for offtank or imp for health buff + dmg?
---
3.	If healer gets attacked... that’s a circumstance where I should draw aggro from them right?
---
You can always go to the shop once you entered character screen and choose the free transfer yourself. Dont have to be on peak times
---
Oh fuck
---
Are you having a stroke?
---
Remember when streamers wanted to blackball anyone that camped them?
---
lol that dude is going to have fun levling p2+
---
Yeah I tend not to lifetap below 60%, but it’s not too hard to keep it above 80% if it stresses healer less
---
Yes I know the difference. But my overall data gets deleted during the raid from time to time.
---
Smh, it should hopefully make blizzard more aware of increasing congressional scrutiny and take steps to actively prevent this from happening in the future. Shutting down and closing as many outlets as possible is stopping it. 
---
And this isn't a problem with only the us, the rise of white surpemacy is a world wide issue.
---
I once got a 2hr ban in Vanilla for telling someone to fuck off. Right before a raid. I appealed and got it lifted. The GM agreed with me and said that there is a reason chat filters are in the game. Im not sure youll get the same answer in 2019 though
---
Me but I’m lvl 30 and 10.
---
Healers don't need to pay attention to rogues on/between trash pulls. They know what they're doing and the good ones will handle it just fine. If I pull aggro, it's because the healer had aggro and I'm bringing it back to the tank that forgot they could walk.
---
Am I the only one who hears "phteven" when looking at that mug?
---
i prefer pve servers but i may check it out. also thinking of windseeker or pagle
---
ty, and happy cake
---
You're not entitled to a group. Most people don't want to waste their time running dungeons with a bunch of meme spec dps who are going to do half the damage as someone with a cookie cutter spec who knows which 2-3 buttons to press and when to press them.
---
&gt;Or you have a really shallow understanding of love, human emotion, and some people's capacity for it. 
---
You cannot love a complete stranger, theres nothing remotely deep here.
---
Ever since the hotfix shouts aren't good for maintaining threat on multiple mobs. The best way I've found is to spec down to Sweeping Strikes and put the rest in prot. Imp Charge&gt;Bloodrage  (if up)&gt;SS &gt;Berserker Stance&gt;Whirlwind&gt;Defensive Stance and start your normal rotation.
---
You can pull this off in a couple of seconds and the dps can go ham. I've been using this since reaching SS and haven't had any issues.
---
Edit: If your dps give you a sec, hit Berserker Rage then Whirlwind.
---
And you're still gonna get some lonely basement dweller messaging you, "YoU'rE tAnKiNg ThE mArKeT"
---
Do you even know what a boomer is?
---
&gt; no such thing as actual information
---
I wish I could troll like this
---
Va-POO-Rize
---
Are these maybe the items that become available in P5? AtlasLoot shows some gear from various dungeons with a "5" stamped over them, signifying that they are (or should be) added in when P5 hits.
---
Even then just go for the one off immol'rhar in dm west
---
Anyone have a mirror? Or am I the only one that can’t watch it?
---
Are they larping?
---
imo Hyptonic Blade is 100% worth grinding, i still use it on my mage (cleared MC 10+ times) and its only a little worse than the best 1 hander you can get outside of raids
---
Are you looking for PvP? I'm in Benediction and its great so far
---
No actually but the reason for that is my pants always have a distinct smell of piss and my ass has a distinct sugary smell although i take a shower each morning and change my underwear at least once a day. I think i have to learn better shaking technique for the peepee and better wiping technique for the poopoo.
---
Its trash
---
I did check that.  It's as it should be.
---
Ha ha. His face! He looks so pissed off.
---
"My lock picking skill isn't high enough." Sure, Jan.
---
No, but revealing that you're working ona project such like it might be.
---
I fucking hate that streamer
---
Yep, troll mage.  When I posted this last night, I was leveling skinning, so I was killing beasts in Hinterlands.
---
A lot of people will want to tell you what to do and say "prot isn't needed" (yeah we know). Nothing's needed, you can DPS and tank as 0/0/0, and the main question is what's going to be fun since this is a game.
---
Most people are sad if their DPS sucks in raids (relatively), so for them the mantra is that prot isn't needed because fury is needed for them to maximize their DPS. If you have more fun doing more DPS, then maybe just go fury, full DPS spec.
---
Some people are still running lots of dungeons and are sad if they're struggling to hold threat and spending most of their playtime with relatively pointless talents in fury given that they spend most time tanking. They should go full bloody prot with 31+ points and have more fun.
---
Some people want to pick up defiance instead of impale so they are a better off tank in raids, and that's somewhat viable as a way to be a jack of both trades. If you are not getting points in defiance, don't bother spending any points in prot (for pve). 5/31/15 is ok. In raids you really don't have to stance dance much as an off tank, so those arms points are much more valuable picking up defiance.
---
Ouch. Where is this trap? :)
---
If you're combat swords you should be opening with sinister strike. Garrote is garbage.
---
&gt;Mages also charge for water and portals, even in groups.
---
my time isnt free pleb
---
Ah, so now you're the one dictating what is and isn't comedy? If you've never seen people joking about committing literal genocide, you apparently don't know your own teammates in this argument very well.

this message brought to you by people who don't know how to extract .zip files

Framing it loosely like that makes them feel similar enough. But I remember chasing Garrosh with Thrall throughout WoD. The feeling to me was night and day. Sylvanas was a fallen hero. Garrosh was a villain from the beginning.
---
Garrosh's story was specifically about manipulating the timeline and establishing Orc domination. I had really no idea what Sylvanas was doing beyond acting out in hate toward the living.
---
I think the idea is there's an old god or something that is pulling strings in Sylvanas's story. With Garrosh, it was all him and Guldan..  and some demons.
---
I don't know why you're saying Sylvanas is the leader of the scourge.. that seems backwards to what we witnessed. It seems like the scourge are going to be taking over Azeroth while we make sure Sylvanas doesn't fuck anything else up in the Shadowlands.
---
Is that when the +25 agility enchant comes?
---
im a bit iffy on pvp servers, i enjoy pvp like in battlegrounds but idk if that style of play is for me
---
I’m sure glad not everyone posts a screenshot when they see someone die to an npc
---
Leveling a priest involves casting a couple spells and then alt tabbing out while you wand creatures to death.
---
ZF xp is really good till 51/52 if you enjoy that type of gameplay and have a good group going.
---
Half the time it's easier to go through dungeons with undergeared DPS than overgeared warriors who take all the aggro off the tank.. especially when the warriors are in more of a rush than the mages, never bandage/eat, and pull before the tank or healer or ready. You want the windfury totem? Then don't pull before i'm ready! The totems share share the same cooldown as my heals and i can't pop both when you're already at 70% hp and I haven't even started my heal cast yet
---
Were you using Argent defender? Thrash blade is better.
---
That is part of it and part of 1.10, but note that it says that "Many items have been improved in quality and use"
---
and on some items like https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13967/windreaver-greaves#comments
---
says 
---
"The boots have been updated at the 1.10 patch
---
they loose the +7 force and spirit to gain
---
+1% hit
---
not a bad alt to the beast***** boots"
---
which sounds like a fairly good improvement. although not sure, that comment supposedly is from patch 1.9.4, maybe it was announced and was found out then? i also dont think there is force, so maybe he means attack power or strength?
---
Wtf
---
Eeh idk bout that. Even in 1.12 you could make macros and addons that automatically chose a target and dispells. In 1.10 they did limit the API a bit but I'm not entirely sure how this particular decursive feature worked so it's possible they changed something that broke the addon but it was def still possible to make a 1 button dispeller. It wasn't until 2.0 that they cracked down on the automatic descision making
---
Never played ff7, but often in japanese media there are german names. And i don't know much about american artists, sorry.
---
What are you talking about?
---
We have a classic+ panel every blizzcon, this year it's about Shadowlands.
---
If this is replicable I neeeeed to know how xD
---
I’m a Spriest. No AoE for me unfortunately
---
Thanks for the encouragement. I’ve never played WoW before and honestly don’t have tons of free time and like my gaming time to be more meaningful. I can’t commit to tons of hours to just grind to get to the fun part of the game. I’ve since gone back to Gw2, and that combat is way more fun..playing leveling/grinding content is actually enjoyable
---
Did you thought your friends continue to play or were those the kind of friends who just jump on new games?
---
I've die hard wow fans who continue and some who dont. I cared for the die hard ones ^^
---
But that's the thing.
---
People back then were "Yea, nice, but we really need people to push the limits". And that was it. People weren't namecalling so hard without a reason. If they were, people just called them a dickead and he was drawing the short end.
---
Nowadays people often openly shame others for having fun by themselves and not doing the cookie-cutter meta that most people are... Its like they only live for the drama, look for the smallest reason to humiliate others. Not the build, but himself the person playing.
---
"You don't want to group with my non-minmax spec? Okay, I'm fine with that, I'll find others who do, good luck. But if after agreeing not to play together you go out of your way to curse at- and attempt to humiliate me, that just speaks of how much of a shit person you are."
---
The priority shifted hard from the person to the gameplay. But it's still the person who is being flamed... for having fun. That's an SMH moment if there is one.
---
I too like to gimp myself because it makes me feel sexually empowered.
---
You cant play 1 hr a day and be 60 no fucking way your 1 - 3 hrs a day statement is wrong
---
Is the Fishing line for the fishing pole (made by Engineers I think, or then BS) in the game yet? Should give +3.
---
Well either way, I appreciate the time you've taken to try and help.
---
Why would you want to play with anyone who hates you play anyway?
---
So I wonder what would happen if Wow Classic ever progressed into Burning crusade stand alone servers or something of that nature....Would you still be able to get to level 70? Or would the "vanilla" zone be 1-50 and the "expansion zone" (Burning crusade) be 50-60? Because Imo that would seriously suck ass.
---
It's much slower though. The intention of a health pot is to keep you alive when you need it most; when you don't have time to move your mouse to an actionbar slot and click it.
---
The player in the OP is a perfect example of why it's a bad idea to click health potions. Sure, he almost certainly would've died anyway, but he was too slow to click on the potion and got 0 benefit from it.
---
It's all perspective. There plenty of 60s who have nothing to do but a 3 hour raid once a week.  This is only about a month behind vanilla release, and back then people were pretty Clueless. For the most part people are way ahead of where they were 15 years ago.  They aren't will not cater to the Casual player base.
---
I like that x-perl 7 stone tile look 👌
---
Could talk more about planned phase length, have a q&amp;a, talk about their plans for classic beyond the phases.   Are we going to have a balance patch or are warriors just going to be the best forever?
---
Hi, /u/Mightisrightis

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dqpkv8/just_downloading_classic_any_tips_for_a_late_comer/). 
---
Yea that was the norm back in the day. Now I get people only speaking in party, not realizing the difference I think.
---
How bad will leveling be after phase 2 hits? I keep hearing if youre lvl 40+ its gonna be very rough.
---
Im not raiding with it, just 5 mans, where I dont really want to use pots :)
---
I’ll barely hit 50 at 8 days! You’re doing fine lol. As long as I am able to do Naxx before the game dies I’ll be happy.
---
It's against the TOS and Blizzard bans a lot for that sort of thing.
---
Low effort best effort?
---
You dont? Wut bout immershun?
---
Dead* would be the proper word in that sentence if you wanted to use it that way. Kill is a verb. “How is he not dead”.
---
I'm in the same boat as you. We will most likely have to hide and dungeons for a while.  And as a warrior, that's preferred anyway. 
---
I'm Definitely not quitting, I'm having too much fun. Will never be closed do the hardcore players butt the game at where we are at is, and can still be awesome.  But yes it's going to be a pain in the ass ar times. Enjoy the chaos and get down with the PvP ):
---
Also useful. Agreed.
---
I actually think that’s the idea. With lowering the leve cap, I’m sure it will be a portal like silithus, where you port between old and new.
---
It would be easier to ask to limit multishot usage during pulls with CC. Multishot represents way too much of a hunter's single target damage to give up entirely.
---
You chase slyvanas with saurfang AND thrall(at the end) through BFA. 
---
Sure i may of misread what the cinematic of her smashing the LK helm but to me that signified she was taking over.
---
Yeah, I'm on the other RP server and its dead. Have trouble finding DPS to fill 5 mans like scholo at times. No RP. Toxic culture on the rise. People talking about pogs for some reason, retro 90s shit or something. Faction imbalance that actually doesn't matter because it's empty all the time. I regret not going Grobbulus.
---
This number game is getting really old.
---
It is legal you probably mean is it allowed by Blizzard in the terms of service. They don't crack down hard on it, so I guess they're OK with it.
---
jk ur right, prob dont need on Golemagg
---
There are definitely those kinds of people the "Get in get my gear and go" types. I confess I've been one before just based on my day. Remember that they only have as much effect on your day as you let them because once they're gone, they're gone. 
---
One of the things I do is I'll look up youtube run-throughs of instances or raids I'm unfamiliar or unconfident with so I can get a sense of what the norm is and how "pros" do it. Maybe that would help you? Looking up healing guides/videos to help you feel like you have a firmer grasp on the class/expectations and "best" way to do things.
---
Legal? Well Blizzard won't throw you in jail for it. They will ban your account though.
---
i did this everytime lol
---
&gt; Most people don't have the luxury
---
??? its a fucking video game lmao you're not a WF player do whatever you want
---
That did the trick, thank you!
---
Thanks for the insight into your crude manner.
---
oh fuck
---
No, you completely missed my point. Im saying that raiding is great in the current game but for me (and many others) its not enough to compensate for the lack of world depth and quality content outside of it. 
---
Concerning the shadowlands I am not saying that people shouldnt be excited. Every new xpac brings new aspects to the game and im personally very interested for example to see what blizzard learnt from classic and whether it will spill over.
---
How does your weapon choice effect either? Just the stats? Or is there more to it? I think I have a staff with +15 AP at the moment. What should I look for?
---
Yessir! It worked!
---
&gt;it suggests systematic racism
---
Fucking
---
Shit
---
I like it
---
Fuck having chill when you pull a small pack and die because the healer was afk and said nothing.  The group still lives though because they had a frost mage.
---
Is there a way to turn it off?
---
Unfair to Charge a fee.. your damn right if it's all my mats and work.. but I will tip them what I think it's worth depending on what I got made. If it was an endgame content item like the old bs weapons, gear, that require specializations and whatnot, it'd be a significant tip too!
---
I've been using this add-on with no updates for about 2 months now. No issues.  Works as expected.
---
&gt; Paladins are better healers then priests in fights without much mobility.
---
Define 'better'. Paladins are certainly more *efficient* healers. However, they're healers with only one gear - slow and efficient. While this is useful, it's also not something that makes your raid better when you ramp it up. When you're facing the 'gear check' fights with serious healing demands, you're not relying on your Paladins.
---
&gt; And the Mageblade also gives crit that is way more useful then the mp5 of say aurastone.
---
And it's even more useful for the Mage/Warlock (who get +100% effect from it rather than +50%).
---
&gt; I still remember those mages that complained about their "shitty" mage blade in AQ while half the paladins would have given an arm and leg for one but had to pass again and again for some green/blue frost bolt bastard.
---
Jindo's Hexxar is significantly easier to acquire in ZG. Mages have to either wait until halfway through AQ40 or rely on Nefarian drops (where there's also a mace that drops that's better than Mageblade for Paladins).
---
I think you're falling into the trap of many people who only see 'their' gear and don't think about it in the context of what serves the raid best.
---
I appreciated the informative post lmfao
---
The real Nope is now Apes
---
I don't agree that racist speech is an automatic ban. I've seen it go on in world chat for long periods with no repercussions. And this guild seems to be infamous on Grobbulus. It didn't take a genius to figure out that someone should be keeping an eye on them. 
---
According to the thread players left and formed new guilds called &lt;Liberty&gt; and &lt;Loyalty&gt;. News Flash! They are likely to also be harboring racism. The guildleader of the first has reportedly named his toon for Hitler's dog. Asking for community managers to keep an eye on the usual suspects doesn't seem like too much to ask. 
---
What I would like is to not have to deal with any of this. Get this shit off WoW and back into the shadows of the internet where these cockroaches belong. The way to do that is not auto-bans but when people say racist shit investigate their chat history to ban not just them but all of their fellow travelers.
---
For sure
---
Currently leveling as affliction and its trivially easy once you hit mid 40's. Between dark pact, drain life and life tap you can kill mobs almost indefinitely at a very fast rate. I couldn't imagine leveling destruction where you have to chug water constantly and can't take on multiple mobs nearly as easy. Im sure it works okay but one of the pluses of playing warlock is the the speed/sustain of leveling affliction.
---
Stupid people gonna stupid. I never say it but i do get a little irritated when a healer heals me up after they see me start a bandage. Like bro you just made me waste 2 runecloth lol
---
undead rogue...
---
I've read before that it stands for far right ethno-nationalism but I don't think that's common usage
---
To add, why will it be harder? Will I have a problem on a PvP server as a level 10 playing casually? I've never played WoW before and started a week ago.
---
The mapmaker only tags guilds that have some degree of backstory and take RP semi-seriously. Everyone knows that when Enclave roleplays, it’s for trolling/lolz only.
---
Username checks out lmao
---
False. Pick a new guild. I main tank as a druid. You can tank all the current raid content as a druid.
---
Is it available through twitch? I swear I searched for it and got no results. Would make things a lot easier on me rather than making so many macros.
---
Yeah but he waited until he was at like 10% health and then tried to panic-click it. OFC that's gonna end badly. I am aware that clicking is slower so I always try to pop mine a bit early, I've never died because I couldn't click my health pot fast enough. I'm know I'm never gonna make it to rank 14 PVP playing like this but it works for me.
---
You can do Maraudon mate, just make sure to have some strong heals/dps by your side and should be no problem
---
Crime no, but I would rather not run and wait till a tank I know comes on, or one that needs it from lfg/trade, before I would ever pay or run on a system where we are basically giving you stuff to pay for you to run us. (And I'm an ex tank myself)
---
Thanks for letting me know :)
---
He’s talking about trying to level during p2 when pvp gives you honor
---
Lmao amazing the sheep thing worked.
---
They've already talked about class balance in previous interviews, there is nothing to talk about unless they changed their mind. People need to realize that classic+ is modern wow, they won't develop 2 MMO's from scratch at the same time. Classic had about 1/10 of the people working on it compared to modern WoW, meaning Classic+ would have to make many times the money (probably 10x if not more) Classic is making for them to even consider doing it, and the only way for it to make that much money is MTX.
---
Deviate Delight is well-populated and not as pretentious as Grobbulus.
---
I have a Frankenstein's rig which I've swapped half the parts of a several times, depending on what's the bottleneck.
---
You can either throw a lot of money at it at the beginning or less and more afterwards, but it has served me since the end of TBC. We can argue though, that it's not the same PC which it was. Ship lf Theseus etc.
---
Baa ram ewe
---
same
---
Can honor help you level?
---
Should have done it while leveling, worth it for the XP.
---
As a healer I can't stand tanks that do this. Please don't help perpetuate this terrible idea. You're job is to tank, to mitigate damage, and stay alive. Not to add a little bit of dps to a raid of approx. 30 dedicated dps. Idk why people are trying to reinvent the wheel.
---
I briefly installed healbot but found its drop down menus hard to program with my mouse (have 12 side buttons). I know nothing about vudu tho.
---
MC is T1 (Rag t2 legs)/ Ony T2 helm
---
Im sure you know, but dont forget about the 5 second immunity. Need to wait for that until you can fear a second time
---
She meant special education.
---
Get Pawn and look up some stat weights from Icy Veins or Noxxic or whatnot.  Then you can know at a glance which item is better
---
I see, yeah guild wars is good too.   
---
For me classic is very nostalgic and I just think the community and playing in a guild doing raids and getting loot together is so rewarding.   
---
It’s a commitment so I get that it’s a struggle if you can find yourself playing it atleast a little bit you can get 1,5 levels rested (double xp) in a week if you stand in a major city or a inn.   
---
I level two characters rested now so totally do 3 levels per week on the side of raiding with guild.
---
it's literally a nonfactor until 48.
---
Helm?
---
When you drop Gnomish Engineering for Goblin, do you have to start over at 0 skill?
---
Atm classic is the money maker from my understanding.
---
I figured some of them would bail. But some of my friends played retail way longer than me, and I really figured they would stay until the end. Guess ill need some new friends.
---
What's my faction/class have to do with it? :(
---
Yeah if it reviews well I’ll play the expansion. Since I already am going to have my sub. Looking forward to it. Seems cool to have a main in classic and alt on live if live is good.
---
Now is a great time. By the time you get to the dangerous 48+ zones, pvp will be more relaxed.
---
I love you
---
Just gehennas. Perhaps garr if your guild is doing some scuffed strategy.
---
Yes but are you trying to say certain specs wouldn't get excluded from groups back in vanilla because I assure you they would.
---
Nuh uh , i never tank and also never reserve anything. I just like hitting hard.
---
It's all ElvUI, which is a complete interface replacement.  It takes a while to tweak and really make it work for you, but once you do it is amazing.
---
Undead seem to love it.
---
Am confirm, can DPS! LFG Cookie's Cove
---
The Naga's inside the cave on the isle in Feralas is a supreme grinding spot for your level. Would be best to be alliance though.
---
Example2: For a while the sub was super into Classic+, lately TBC has been the gospel of god and anyone wanting Classic+ is either an optimistic idiot or blizzard would never be able to make a good expansion.
---
Players of level 48 and above will grant honor to level 60s, so from 48 onwards you might be in for some involuntary and unpleasant/unfair PvP. More so than up until now.
---
Same with when I accidentally hit a mob and put Deep Wounds on it, I'm sorry I don't crit by choice those times!
---
No don't completely avoid it. Unless you truly don't care for it. No one's going to get Rank 1 (14) in the first week. It'll be impossible.  It will take many weeks for the first Grand Marshall or High Warlord to get achieved. I THINK ;).  Hope I'm not wrong. 
---
But every week you lose 10% of your honor ranking. Then 20% st rank 8 or 10 I think.  Anyone going for it the top two ranks is going to have to play full time for weeks
---
Well good news(?) is most people already did that 52+ish just for gear. In that sense it's not warping gameplay too crazily, and you can use the /camp trick to reset.
---
I didn't play vanilla back in the day, but from what I have gathered in the threads, it will mainly become harder on a PvP server because almost all players are more likely to world PvP while questing, so you may get ganked by others in your zone.  
---
This is because phase two brings the honor system, so people will want to engage in world PvP more as there is something more to be gained.
---
The reason people say "its a nonfactor until level 48" is because level 48 is the lowest level that a level 60 character can kill and still gain honor.  This means you most likely won't notice much of a difference in the zones before you are level 48, except there may be a little bit more from other similar-level toons in your zone.
---
The reason for invites are typically obvious and without need to whisper although no one should repeatedly request after being denied.
---
Im level 53 rn, working on getting to 60 as fast as possible and will hopefully be able to participate in southshore pvp and get rank 3 so that I can save 100 total gold on max level mount and training
---
And don't ever like... feel bad for that, if for some reason you ever would. Everyone's brain is different. It's like, some people's brains are salads, and ranch dressing goes well with it. Other people's brains are popcorn. Who da hell puts ranch on popcorn??
---
So your brain and Classic don't go well together. That's ok. And good job.
---
Hybrids shouldnt be able to do as well as classes that are specialized. Thats it. Being a hybrid class means you have the luxury of being able to play different roles in dungeons or while leveling, but not in raids.
---
Vudu is super complex. I still haven't got it to be just the way I want, but at least I know it'll do whatever I would need. It also does predictive healing so you can control your over heals.
---
I think prot pallies are good honestly, people just aren't sure how to manage them if that makes sense. They do use alot of mana but you can down rank and Seal of Wisdom, I rarely have to drink unless I am slamming full damage for a pull.
---
Imagine using consumables in world pvp...
---
First of all, "is it really that hard to understand" is just confrontational - so fuck off.
---
Secondly there's no way to know that this guy is doing his racist shit until people report him or posts get made about him. But if you saw this in game and your first thought is "wow I can't believe blizzard did this", then that's you putting blame on the company and not the actual racist, which is really fucked up.
---
Making somebody out to be a racist is a serious thing to do. Do you think the the blizzard employees are racist? Because this congressman is closer to saying that, than saying anything about the player in question.
---
In p2 people get honor for killing players of green or higher Level (that is lvl 48+ At 60). Since There are no bgs the only way to make honor is killing players in the open world so there will be roaming gank squads roaming high level zones
---
Maybe necrosis
---
Wow you sounds so badass you must be really cool
---
I usually wait until the second invite, whisper,  "yes?" And if rude or another invite without explanation /ignore. If polite, humor the person.
---
Agreed...  If you already finished all available content...  Play less there is a live waiting for you.
---
Wonderful, thanks!
---
you are welcome :)
---
Theres a loading screen tooltip for these situations. If you dont read tooltips that makes you...bit of a tool ahahahaha
---
Because the guy said phase 2 will come out in january
---
Yo fuck this beta hive mind
---
I'm pretty doubtful they're doing this to force people to play retail.
---
keep coping
---
I mean if a rogue is trying to solo a mob and getting smashed, that's just dumb, but it's a pretty easy fix, just let him die
---
Items that got buffed in that patch are present in the buffed versions now, AIUI; but items that were introduced are not yet in and will be added in p5.
---
Oh my god I do have to explain context do you don't I? Because it isn't just a comment to be interpreted. It was a comment on a very specific image, showing a specific point of view.  Your opinion is irrelevant, you don't decide what I meant, I commented directly to OP. 
---
God damn no wonder people think context is irrelevant today.
---
They will rush all classic content just in time so most ppl will swap to shadowlands
---
Well yeah if you're just playing to zoom to 60 you're going to aoe grind on a pve server or in instances. World pvp is fun, I find it bizarre so many people are so scared of even regular pvp and especially gankers that they allow them to dictate how they play the game
---
haha funny misspell on reddit me upvote
---
If I'm in the world questing and someone is clearly doing the same quest, I'll invite or accept an invite without asking.  If it's for anything else, I'd ask or expect to be asked.
---
https://itemization.info
---
I think this is what you're looking for. If an item had multiple versions, it will show on there.
---
Sounds like healing is not the class for you e.e
---
WHY U MAD BRO.
---
Thank god p2 is coming, tons of new things to do. Also that will make my brm camping usefull.
---
warlocks sell those rings since they can solo princess, you just stand at entrance while they do it, they usually charge 10-15g, payment when the ring drops
---
Well i mean if that’s what people wanna do okay but that’s not the issue. 
---
They’re not giving out Phase 2 because ppl get bored, no, they’re doing it because Blizzard HATES that we play classic. They don’t want us to play classic. 
---
They want us to buy copies of their diarrhea of an MMO.
---
I'm the complete opposite, I'm a healer but i love when locks use me as a mana battery, I can drink and get mana while they're in combat, and then just heal them back to full mana and repeat, makes everything go much faster if they don't need to worry about mana.  
---
Only time it gets annoying is if they can't read the situation and are doing it while we overpulled or something.
---
I wonder if theyre gona rush through classic and hope everyone moves on to retail.
---
Really makes no sense to me. Majority of active players didnt ding end game yet let alone see the content.
---
They wanna appease the hardcores who are bored.... those same hardcores will come back it doesnt matter
---
I’m a warlock and I make a conscious effort to avoid doing all the things you put there. The only one I had a problem wit for a while was tapping to much and never drinking a fellow guildie healer quickly put me in my place though and I drink whenever possible unless the healer tells me to go wild.
---
Awesome, shit bout rogues is true tho (sincerely a wl )
---
Its called blade flurry and adrenaline rush, hard for any class to out dps a geared rogue without many aoe pulls. You should probably stop using free loot so rogues dont take it all, you want us to die instead of vanish? That makes sense lol
---
Never heard of sap? Or kick? Or kidney? Or distact coming pat? Or blinding a mob off healer? No utility you say? =|
---
DO YOU EVEN PLAY?
---
2019 living in a robot nation.
---
I would have liked an additional week, bit looking forward to world pvp.
---
Hell yeah healths pots and FAPs
---
Aahhhhhh now I recall. And if I remember correctly, you can buy some type of pvp gear with honor points?
---
He was being a dick on purpose.
---
However in some instances its not necessary. If someone is killing rhe same mobs as you for a kill quest or a named, just accept the invite
---
WTS mageweave
---
Bolvar died in that cinematic? Didnt seem so
---
Even when out questing and its obvious why? When competing for tags on kill quests or about to kill a named?
---
I’m an Orc warrior that uses Dal Rends, but that’s only because I got the set on my 3rd Rend run. I’ll probably upgrade to some axes at some point but doesn’t seem worth to spend the gold on such a small upgrade until I get Lionheart.
---
&gt;giv free port pls
---
Get out
---
Nah, they're doing it because people are going hardcore and exhausted all content within two weeks. They are trying to keep classic numbers up.
---
Had a wonderful scholo run this week with a pally tank. Especially against undead mobs they are great.
---
Pally debuffs.
---
fair enough, but in this case i was in orgrimmar.
---
Nice, Iam lvl 50,5 atm
---
My bad. Still extremely underwhelming to me.
---
Can you get two Lotus from one node?
---
I was in a bleeding edge progression guild in early Vanilla and I never used any of these braindead addons. lol
---
Also, flash heal is incredibly mana inefficient compared to greater heal/heal.
---
Reminds me of that time yesterday when our servers biggest guild GM got banned for wearing a kkk outfit with two "slaves" following him for a halloween costume contest in game and then a politician even tweeted about it.
---
good. only losers do this
---
Yup blizzard is intentionally sabotaging their own game.
---
You did it reddit, you managed to outperform yourself in stupidity.
---
I havent
---
You are.   They should be leaving the healer mobs to you, as you have gouge and blind and kick(?)iirc to stop heals from going out, while they kill the damage mobs.
---
i said 1-3, that means somedays youd play 3, others maybe 2.5 next day 1.5 ect ect
---
the idea being youd average playing bout 2 hours a day, across 90 days you could get 60%~ of a level every single day.
---
Nope. It’s a stolen valor name.
---
Oh did you know ? once you hit level 60 you kinda want to spend those points elsewhere
---
There are 3, it seems.
---
My god sylvanas... you've, enhanced yourself.
---
By buffing him or speccing into the demonology tree
---
Ugh this guy “streams”??? What for???
---
If a clicker can get away this nonsense I’ll be the next ninja
---
Holy crap, I remember those assholes in planetside. They were cancer. Pretty much everyone including other people on their faction hated them.
---
Whats with all this bitching about it being rushed? Did you seriously think they'd go 6 months between launch and the honor system like it was in vanilla?
---
I'm a warlock, too. It's pretty hard to consistently not fuck up when it's so easy.
---
Bots are why I quit playing retail in legion. People don't realize that they literally wouldn't be able to afford flasking for every pull in raids, even the top guilds. Around 90% of all ore and herb come from bots and have since at least cata(i can't personally confirm any earlier). 
---
They are devaluing our time. You know how many more people would be out in the world if a rare flower was worth 5000g? 
---
I also quit d3 after making it to I think the 7th solo crusader on the leaderboard because every single person save one above me was botting paragon level making it effectively impossible to compete. 
---
dont even know why im playing classic this is fucking dumb
---
Pretty much, I've seen one black lotus, all the spawns are likely camped by bots
---
I'd say 200ish. 250 seems a little steep but if you're going to wearing it for a few phases and you hate UBRS as much as I do, it might be worth it to you.
---
Alliance have honor unlike horde. I've played horde and alliance. Horde will wave then gank you as soon as you are low on health. Worst alliance will do is a gnome will sheep you for a minute and lol.
---
You can still do dungeons for quests rewards / high drop chance loot / plain old fun.
---
Good news!
---
Your auction of runecloth sold
---
Shh, all is fine little tree. Just cast regrowth.
---
You’re right of course. And I haven’t actually had any issue with any mage so far. Or anyone else really.
---
The cathedral is pretty big. It’s a little harder since they hotfixed being able to stack mobs by stutter stepping but still doable
---
I leveled as Destruction in vanilla. It's fine- any spec lock is easier to level than most other classes, period.
---
Destruction is great dps, but more mana intensive than other specs.
---
so nothing outside of talents and buffs? heard maybe increase my stam will effect his?
---
&gt; Shamans deliberately forget putting down their windfury totem...
---
 I haven't committed to this yet, but if one more cunt warrior links their damage meter and complains about my DPS, I'll pretend I'm suffering from alzheimer so they never see a windfury proc ever again.
---
This is starting to get personal bois
---
Oh, I haven't met many truly bad players at all. Where did I state that?
---
The fuck are you talking about
---
If you are doing lather runs, it's not worth it as a sham trust me. They are possible, but the money needed for the eng bombs to cause aoe threat make it not worth it at all.
---
Oh I don't steal a chest on purpose ever. I will check the dungeon after a clear for any gubbins left on the ground and occasionally I find a chest, but I never intentionally look over a chest or claim my LP isn't high enough.
---
I only heal life tapping locks if i got a mage in the group that provides water, i'm not gonna spend money healing someone who is to lazy to drink.
---
A bot that just walks around?
---
What’s so bad about clicking ?
---
I can answer this since I remember how it was when wow first released:
---
  Certain areas are going to be absolute shitshows. Hillsbrad will be a gankfest at the farms, the yeti cave and the Tauren Mill/Soutshore area will be a warzone with a constant raid presence from both factions.
---
  Same thing with STV and you probably won't be able to travel from Gurabashi to Booty Bay without corpse running a few times.
---
  BRD will also be a guaranteed death if you are trying to go in the alone.
---
 Tanaris will see some skirmishing and you probably won't be able to quest there at all. The entrance to ZF is bound to have a constant presence of gankers and even trying to leave the Gadget will be dangerous.
---
  What you won't see a lot of is city/town raids because no one is going to want to risk losing honor because someone kills a civilian NPC.
---
  You won't be safe anywhere as a lvl 48+ because for the first few weeks, at least, everyone is going to go by the "red is dead" philosophy. Waving won't help you, " golf clap" won't either. Your best options will be staying off the road and constantly rotating your camera while fighting mobs because an attack could come from anywhere at anytime.
---
Everyone always talks about how bad mages are.. or warriors not wanting to tank. As a healer, I hate warlocks. Seriously every warlock I’ve ever been in a group with life taps non-stop. And it’s always after the fight, when I’m getting close to oom, then i drink to get mana to heal the warlock.. but the tank saw my mana pool regen, so then he pulls. Now I’m starting a fight with half mana.  Drink more, life tap less. Annoying rant over.
---
How is paying for a drop any different to paying for a BoE on the auction house? How do you think those items came into the world in the first place?
---
You are both naive and stupid, dumb orc. 1 retail player = 5 classic players in terms of income. Blizzard is accountable to investors. Do the math.
---
/camp works as well
---
Good job, make those streamers eat some dust.
---
Or maybe a dk?
---
Yeah, but im doing the winterspring saber grind, which is much easier as shadow, and spirit tap helps keep me from wasting as much time drinking. 
---
In any real context you're 100% right, but for what I'm doing, it just makes sense for me to keep it. I tried a diff spec and the difference was very noticeable
---
His face tells everything. Nice revenge.
---
I mean, can't he be banned from both Twitch and WoW for that last comment..?
---
That's not min maxing, that's removing any thought from the game. It's like playing a driving game where you just hold down one button and it accelerates, steers and brakes for you.
---
I, too, like to arbitrarily empower myself sexually by using fake metrics in a video game
---
that would require blizzard spending money
---
Join world chat and lookingforgroup

If we're both trying to kill the same mobs, sure no problem.  But slapping me with a demand to do something for you gets you sent to the Shadow Realm Jimbo

---
Yep, no problem if everybody is like that, I agree. But the issue I was bringing up is that people think it is perfectly okay that warrior tanks roll on purely dps items like leather pieces.
---
You're delusional if you think they will "rush" all of vanilla's content in the next 6-7 months.
---
Furthermore, why would Blizzard try and get people to "switch" from classic to retail? They're two entirely different games for two entirely different playerbases.
---
The post?
---
These are MLG strats
---
It's funny that I instantly knew he's bad at the game just by looking at his UI
---
That thing you put on your head
---
"I'l just switch to an alt"
---
Sounds like u need to find a good guild
---
As an alliance in whitemane. You aren’t looking and you must be in a bad guild
---
Fuck yeah we should, I love that game.
---
It all makes so much sense now
---
Winterspring is great. I use my everlook transporter to farm soul shards there and hearth back. Plenty of mobs right outside the city that die easy and are close together. Just stay away from Furbolg camps and you'll never compete for a mob
---
Since this is in german he probably said "Würstchen" or he really said "Wurst"
---
Its not a very powerful, cool or clever insult.
---
We knew P2 was coming soon. Them actually following through with it doesn’t mean they are rushing anything. Especially for a phase that doesn’t add new content. 
---
I’d be more concerned if they delayed P2.
---
Yep, but for some reason every so often you get a healer that  keeps casting a big heal on you every single time you start bandaging.
---
Why can't I eat corpses as a gnome though?
---
2.5 months a phase is healthy
---
Lol, if you're in a decent guild, they won't give you an item that makes you 2% better, when it makes casters 15% better.
---
You're right, I specced it wrong. Fixed link.
---
Have you tried joining a guild that needs people to fill out raids? They might be willing to help you out .I find it hard to believe that a dedicated tank can’t find a group and it’s driving you to quit. It seems like all anyone needs are tanks .
---
Couldn’t agree more. GL when you find me, I’ll remember your name haha
---
At phase 2, 60s are not going to be camping lowbies, they're going to be fighting other 60s for honor.
---
So i joinned a group for stratholme run. Everything ok! 
---
We got there,and then the party leader says that we are starting this with only with 4 players, that the other one will join us later. Ok by me. 
---
I was doing a good job and being friendly. I even openned some lockboxes for them. 
---
We were at the midle of the dungeon after some bosses killed, and the 5th guy appears. After one fight that they wiped, cuase i vanished, they told me i couldnt be a part of the team and they kicked me. 
---
I ask why and they told me one player didnt like me and told that i dont do damage and play bad. Who was that guy? The 5th guy that appeared! I was the second most dps, cant beat mage aoe off corse, the third dps was 5k bellow me,my gear is almost all pre-bis and i do 0 damage? 
---
I dont know what spec he was doing, but i think that he wanted the same item that i want, so he kicked me and placed me on ignore. 
---
He must be a guild leader or something ,because i asked the other players and they were fine playing with me.
---
Why are people so childish and spoiled? This are the players that are ruining the community
---
If you are a child dont waste other people's time please! 
---
It must be a stupid story for you but i wanted to share anyway, to show some of the bad and child players that we have here.
---
BS both sides are just idiot monkeys behind keyboards faction means nothing
---
May be different for locks but hunter pets don’t scale with gear
---
Warlock
---
That's in later xpacs. Later on your stam increases his, your SP increases his attacks, etc.
---
Vanilla, pets scale with talents, level and training.
---
Shattering Throw is WoTLK.
---
I guess I'm the odd lock out I almost never tap in combat unless its the end of a boss and fight and I'm completely out of mana or combat is over and I want to get my mana from 0 to full without needing to drink twice, and even then I eat too so I'm not making the healer burn the mana he just got back.
---
As a Warlock that's too many Warlocks.
---
Alright. I've made my 3 characters there. The Diplomat is in the house. :-)
---
It includes bonuses from gear. All % increased stat talents do.
---
Jokes on them. We don't care about Shadowlands.
---
&gt;Their pet pulls half the instance because they don't dismiss it on jumping skips.
---
what fucking warlocks are you playing with that have a voidwalker or felhunter out in dungeons lol
---
Probably, the only name I remember is Tidy but I am also on Arugal.
---
we all chose the life we lead, the life we got is the life we wanted, we chose/are choosing it right now
---
Slam is a much better rage dump for two-hand fury than Heroic Strike, and isn't normalized. It interrupts the swing timer, so getting the cast finished ASAP is worth rage and damage. It's obviously worthless for DW Fury. It's really more of a raid DPS / dungeon tank support build though, Slam is finicky to use when fighting something that's punching you back (it suffers from pushback), and with current gear levels you're unlikely to get enough rage to be able to utilize it without raid buffs / debuffs.
---
[I can relate](https://i.imgur.com/Yz16Fm9.png).
---
Damn I feel inefficient now.
---
Getting better != having to play competitively. 
---
Also, and this is entirely anecdotal, but min/maxers are without a dumb the most miserable cunts every single video game community can offer, so if they’re having fun I don’t wanna.
---
Yeah but 48+ characters are free honor to 60s. A lot of people dont want even 1v1's because then there is a risk of dying. Killing a bunch of 48s is ezmode.
---
100% legal. Although Blizzard has the right to ban you and sue you for intellectual property theft. ( they wont though)
---
Honestly I would rather spam whirlwind with 5/5 in cruelty rather than mortal strike without it. I'd wait until you can get mortal strike AND 5/5 cruelty before switching, personally.
---
People don't have taste in memes these days. How could you downvote Barak Kodobama?

Edit: You people have no heart.

This guy made a timeline roughly based on vanilla releases.  Roughly 90 days between phases "feels" about right.

No it wasn't speculation at all it was actual information, the dev interview given when they announced phase two at "some point before the end of the year" said that part of the wait was they wanted all realms down to a single layer before the release of world bosses because they were opposed to the idea of potentially having more than one world boss up at a time due to layering.  
---

"But layering was never going to be long-term. Hazzikostas explains  that one of the new features coming in phase 2 is world bosses like  Kazzak and Azuregos. The point of these bosses is that there should be  only one version of them up at a time. Layering would make it easier to  repeatedly farm these enemies for loot.
---
"When Kazzak is up, we  only want one Kazzak," Hazzikostas said. "That's kind of a central  dynamic of how that needs to play out in the outdoor world."
---
I should have put emphasis on the guild part. My guild runs instanced all the time just to help each other. I couldn’t imagine playing classic in another guild if it wasn’t like mine
---
Incendius has a very large population.  It is horde favored pop wise but fairly even.  One of the few remaining servers with layers.  East coast as well.
---
A lot of the things you do is easier starting late, like getting enough gold for your mount. You will also gear up faster.
---
Oooooo you must be a total badass.
---
No it's not min maxing because this can easily be achieved without the addon just by using your brain. It's purely for lazy people.
---
You guys realize that 1.2 released TWO YEARS after launch, right?!  The game was very different only 4 months after launch.
---
Depends on the server. Right now wpvp is essentially worthless, yet on Saurfsng as horde (well balanced to alliance) I find I can barely go anywhere without a total gankfest. The usual hillsbrad, stv and so on are merciless but just going anywhere else .. half the other side are waiting to pounce at every instant :) Don’t even try to meaningful level at peek times ..
---
I’m at 45, and te 8hours per level to 60 is going to be a long haul :)
---
How is hard to rush something that was made 15 years ago?
---
there's a dev interview that says layers were the reason they waited on phase 2.
---
Moving your cursor is how you change movement direction. During the time it takes to "click" the spell you can't move your character as efficiently as you could have. It's not the worst thing ever in PvE, it's inexcusable if you want to be the best you can in PvP
---
The advanced fishing gives +5
---
Edit: Huh apparently not. There is 2 levels for every other prof but not fishing it seems.
---
Just seems like all the rogues who can't take 5 minutes to read a guide get DR set with no effort.
---
The fastest ways to regen mana for a warlock are either life tapping to low hp and bandaging or life tapping to even mana and eating/drinking at the same time. Give us some time to heal ourselves after tapping before angrily throwing out your own big heals and some of your problems might go away on their own.

When you hit level 48 you are a juicy honor bag, and they will hit that all day. Basically it's like turning 18 and standing outside of a prison with the sign asking to be pounded.

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dqqpjh/alliance_bigglesworth/). 
---
It's a game. Play it your own way. You are level 30? So what. You can grind SM to 41. Stay out of STV. in any case, WSG will probably be out by the time you get to the 50s so plaguelands won't be a warzone.
---
Id figure they could use some algoritm or ai/bot to sort out most of them but I guess not? Dont they have software to detect botters too or is that all manual as well?
---
Is pvp honor gear coming in ph2 or just ph3 with bg?
---
If pvp gear is out, shits going down 
---
But I think the good pvp gear  was BG gear and rank gear (basicslly bg ranked)
---
Its a step in the right direction, however nothing short of returning to BC/LK would tempt me to try it after getting a taste of Classic.
---
What a shitty attitude to have. I hope you're thanking all the "miserable cunt" min-maxers who carry your raid every week.
---
Play the game the way it is enjoyable to you mate.  Post in LFG - "60 war lfg - willing to tank, if someone else leads the group and marks"  Doubt you will have much problem finding a group and you have set your expectation out of the gate.
---
Don't recall where Kromcrush sits at with pop but always see people mention a 55H/45A for it. I haven't seen anything though since they had free xfers open to 4 servers for some time, now its just 2. Queue at peak times of course but never had more than 200 in the queue so it's quick.
---
Report the player on your server discord
---
Here’s some Silver mate in honor of your Dad. May he Rest In Peace.
---
So in other words you are saying RNG should only favor those that are reading guides and such? It happens dude. Get over it.
---
While I do agree, I saw a tank mark an x on a battle mage in strat live, die, and then mark the next battle mage with an x and die again because he thought the inquistors were more dangerous. 
---
"I recognize the council has made a decision, but given its a stupid ass decision, I've elected to ignore it"
---
You can, and spending twice as much time in the dungeon with braindead dps really cuts out all the fun for me.
---
Yes, exactly, early on in 2005 intellect was everything.  +heal was hard to find.
---
SpellAnnounce Classic.
---
I do hope bgs come out as I'd like to finish levelling. If the massacre outweighs the effort to level, there will be a lot of quitters from the pre-60 players.
---
Dungeon leveling will definitely be preferable. It's not even about the honor people get for killing you, but a lot of lower level zones like STV and Hillsbrad will also be a warzone as 60s run around looking for each other and you'll be in their way.
---
To get loot easily
---
I’m sure many people pigeonholed into playing that way hated it though. My current raid healers are complaining of being bored regardless.
---
Then I don't get the post
---
It's from vanilla, not really true anymore besides bad players.  Before we had a thousand guides all telling you how to spec and what stats to prioritize.  That and the average age of a classic wow player is probably 15 years older than in vanilla. 
---
That and dungeon itemization for leveling hunters is really bad.  People want to roll on SOMETHING, so if no loot is really good for them, they end up rolling on some weird +int or proc on hit  sword.
---
My hunter is 40 now and I think I've only needed on a boss drop once.
---
Well if you're at a ovious port selling spot like in front of Kargath's Inn i guess it's fine otherwise yeah it's rude.
---
i mean even if you want to relax its really not that much of a warzone on pvp. I leveled two accounts 1-60 and most of the time you get left alone, and at 60 pvp is pretty fun imo.
---
But yeah sure i'll agree with your sentiment, pve is completely zen in that regard if you want to just chill without having to worry about getting ganked or if you like the pve element more.
---
Isn't there a 4th one in wetlands? You are one of several people i noticed who only mention SoS, winterspring, and Tanaris.
---
off corse!
---
Had a LVL 60 ally priest standing at the town in 1K needles today, MC:ing every lowbie there running them off the cliff.
---
Within 10 minutes he was getting camped by 5-6 of peoples mains until he eventually took ress sickness
---
Why are level 1 characters even allowed to do chat channel invites.
---
Wait, do you even have enough druids to bring 2? (I don't know how, but Druids are literally an endangered species on my server)
---
This is wrong. The skyfury helm is in game as the helm lement power
---
do you use a macro or is there an addon you use?
---
If they fix the gear discrepancies in pvp and bring back pvp gear vendors I might return now.
---
Maybe it's the wrong guild for you if you are still having issues finding groups or assistance. Kind of what the guild community is about. Helping out one another for a common goal. I've been in a guild that has scheduled times at night for assistance from the 60's usually consists of at least 1 tank/healer and they'll do pretty much anything that is level 40 and up content.
---
Sounds like time better spent getting gold and buying it from ah.
---
Did my first dungeon (SM) today as a mage. The first thing the other mage in party said was: "this is slow. Can we just aoe pull?". And so we did.
---
I was responding to this.
---
&gt;There’s nothing to do at 60. It’s the right call. MC and ONY are like 5 hours of content every week.
---
If someone is doing MC/Ony in less than 5 hours a week then they'll be trying to do AQ40 when it's released. The beautiful part about Classic WoW is that we know what content is coming so we can prepare for it ahead of time. So if someone in a decent raiding guild has "Nothing to do" then their lying or ignorant.
---
I have thousands of consumables farmed up, full pre-raid BIS, multiple raid items, epic mount, and an alt about to be 60 and I still feel behind considering phase 2 is coming out in 10 days. I thought I still had at least another month.
---
At this rate are we going to be farming Naxx in a year?
---
This is honestly great stuff. I work professionally as an editor, but I could never make these. Could I ask you how you gather a library for these videos? You really know your memes!
---
Naw... doing this confuses the bot, and even when not stuck on a pillar, will just stand still reviving the pet over and over.
---
For some reason, every bot I find is a hunter, so I do this a lot. Another good strat is to help it die to mobs when it agro's something. Do this 10 times to break its gear, then it just suicides itself against mobs till its owner comes back.
---
Pretty standard, you just need to find a raiding guild.
---
 Join a guild, hangout on comms, PvP together.  Pvp is fun, sometimes you lose, big deal. At the end of the day what do you want to accomplish by running away to pve? In 6 months the pve servers will be dead anyways.
---
I had this issue when in game overlays were turned  on from apps like discord and nvidia

That's what I checked for first, but I didn't see any.

---
Heartseeker is alliance heavy, I believe,by a somewhat significant margin. I still see plenty of horde though.
---
Atleast he finally got horrigan banned. Everyone knew he was racist piece of shit for months and nothing happened with reports
---
I looked for Morgraine cause it has a perfect balance of horde and alliance 
---
Sadly it's an EU server
---
I'm not close to 60 yet either and I'm not worried. I just don't understand your mentality. Like there aren't tons of the other people who play casually. Make a guild with them, why do you care what nolifers do, there are enough people in all different situations to find like a minded group. Every game has hardcore and casual people. 
---
Worst case I will just quit the game if I can't raid or do anything, after all even less afternoons wasted right?
---
You have about a week gl
---
You’re a moron.
---
Game is infamous for neets grinding 18 hours a day for rank 1, its always been part of wow too. Retail mostly describes what you're saying though.
---
It helped us by showing their racist antics are not tolerated
---
a ~20+ (age) server would actually be awesome imo. I think a lot of it has to do with age, at least in my experience.
---
I'm in the guild Hero a 10/10 MC and 1/1 Ony guild
---
I've done one dungeon with them.
---
I should rephrase I was in the guild Hero but I just gquit 2mins ago cause I'm no use to them
---
People have been reporting this shit for months. Everyone knew enclave was a white supremacist guild
---
On skull, it's nice if the rogue takes aggro on it while I lock down the rest of the mobs before the ranged start their aoe or healer aggro kicks in. It's so much easier to take back melee aggro than ranged aggro.
---
Other than that, the marks are more for the ranged, for me.
---
Clickers always stand in fire in any raid. They also are slower at getting abilities off and have sloppier rotations. 
---
Using your mouse to move and target and your keyboard for hotkeys is the most efficient way of playing. 
---
Our guild wouldnt allow clickers in our main raid groups lol. It's easy to tell who is a clicker
---
This is my concern if it's as bad as people say it will be I'm afraid that those that started late, dont have 20 hours a wk to play ect, will have a rough time and they wont rereoll to pve Realms. They will quite playing. I expect Blizz will rush put p3 because of this actually. We know one thing and it's that they are all about that money and they want the end of the last quarter to look good on the books, hence why I think they'll push p3 sooner. 
---
One thing is, it could've been a little better if we had a schedule instead of just announce shit a week ahead of time.
---
You have far me accessible trinkets from even earlier dungeons, so why would you be using something worse?
---
Stats shouldn't be a problem. I'd suggest using more fears to preserve your void. Dot it up, send void to next Target while you wand current Target, and fear it when you pull aggro of the void. 
---
At that point your void should have threat on the next mob, so you can keep the chain pull alive, and you start the dot the 2nd mob. Hopefully the dots kill the first mob before the fear drops off, if not, want some more.  Rinse and repeat with more mobs until you run oom
---
If you got hp and Mana left and your void is running low, turn off taunt so your void can recover Mana.  You tank the mob and keep the mob feared until you kill it and your resources are low. Then you eat and drink, your void recovers Mana and hp and you keep going. 
---
While you're leveling and you start to see threat problems, chances are your getting closer to another level of torment. Keep your witts about you until you can train a higher level. 
---
Good luck, and pop health stones like candy.
---
He went to click a pot too last second. To have a *potion* without a hot key is just... dumb.
---
You must be on an EU server.
---
Americans only help if it benefits them.
---
Good, horde or alliance I don't support camping low levels. That's not pvp no matter how much people try to justify it, it's just being a dick to be a dick.
---
Stranglekelp nearly tripled in price on Fairbanks after the phase 2 announcement

You don't sound unfazed.
---
What's the name of that leveling addon at the top of your screen?
---
Cause that's Classic! #nochanges go to retail! (I'm joking of course)  
---
one thing I liked about a lot of the private servers I experienced was you had to be like 5 or 10 to chat outside of /s or /p...so I feel ya!
---
If you just look for groups, you’re likely to find some wanting to do graves.
---
His idea would literally not affect you or Classic...
---
I'm in a guild called Hero
---
10/10 MC
---
1/1 Ony
---
I ran one dungeon with them and couldnt finish it because someone AFK
---
Let me rephrase I was in Hero I just gquit 5 mins ago
---
it's really not.  they finally got to see the success of classic and what they took from it is that retail sucks because you're not lvl 60 and your abilities are different.  
---
instead of polishing retail into a better whatever retail could be, they're gonna shove it in a classic costume and make it worse.
---
See how many people you can get with "what are talents?"
---
Yeah that's gonna be a no from me dog
---
No, he meant like a sausage. Hang upside down like a sausage. Below ground level. Where sausages typically hang.

Get vanquishers for off hand

Let's see. When someone uses ALL CAPS for WORDS in the middle of SENTENCES or does the ((DOUBLE)) parentheses around ((GLOBALISTS))… Yeah, they're probably alt right. If they could use bold underline with a font where the lower case letters are just small capital letters they probably would too.
---
No, you can’t see enemy buffs
---
Who cares?
---
I was Mainly Hoping for a release schedule
---
Wouldn’t it be more delusional to assume they’ll ship Shadowlands in 6-7 months?
---
Well yeah white supremacists love roleplaying badasses who kill "inferior races" they could never experience that irl

In the case described, though? Definitely give a whisper first, preferably a polite one.
---
Not really- how about offering in game rewards for successful bot identification.  Player base does the legworkand reports with attached evidence and if your submission gets verified as a botter by a blizz employee then u get a shitty in game loot crate thing and the bot gets banned.  It wld be enough to make ppl stop and verify suspected bots in the wild rather than just moving on by I think.  Should also need v little employee resources as it would be a simple case review and policy change.
---
Just an idea

True although that probably accounts for only 1% of unwhispered invites.

Paladin tanking question. I am currently 30/21 for blessing of sanctuary and enjoying the 5 man content.

Addons aren’t magic. You would need to cast detect magic

I mained a rogue as well and weirdly that weapon is really good for a long time, as another one said you should be replacing it for vanq blade soon as well as getting a thrash blade soonish, but for the level it's an amazing weapon
---
I'm completely on the other side. I really don't understand the obsession with clean UIs. The information you need should be unmissable and in your face. You don't need a massive viewport for the actual gameplay.

Healbot is purely reactive.  It can not predict incoming damage.  Any good healer is going to know the damage patterns of the encounters and have an incoming heal waiting to land soon after a raid member is damaged.   If you are purely using healbot,  you will end up with much more overhealing compared to the healers that know what they are doing due to your heals being sniped from you far more often.  Using is healbot is not minmaxing in any way and actually causes you to be less mana efficient than a decent healer who knows the fights and can anticipate incoming damage.

Goblin Rocket Boots pattern were going for 75-100+ gold on my server. I think I spent 1g at the time for mine
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons
---
What is the meat of the game that you're referring to? You don't need to skip anything to be a geared 60 by now, it's been months since launch
---
yea, its not too often but it happens to mages a lot. i get at least a few people open trade without a whisper as well in town.
---
What the fuck
---
And world bosses
---
Yes. Cruel barb as main &amp; off hand until sometime better comes along.
---
They aren't adding new content just the honor system. 
---
Literally everybody wants this except the people who don't regret starting on a PvE server who it won't really effect anyway.
---
Any explanation for why I get attacked by townguards when I buff (Blessing of Might) the alliance flightmaster when he's attacking someone from horde? This was in Tanaris*
---
Because I got killed by the guards before? I don't get it.
---
Honestly the best is VuhDo for retail and LunaUnitFrames for classic
---
Bolvar was never meant to be more than a placeholder. To be the lich King after Artjas was defeated because there always has to be a lich king.
---
It has already been stated by blizzard that he is still alive and will be a friendly character in Shadowlands. Through him Allied races will probably be able to become DK's as well.
---
You're close! The honor points make you progress in pvp ranks, and higher ranks allow you to buy certain items - ex. The pvp gear
---
Yeah the whole "40s is halfway" is a really misleading statement. Once you get ST and BRD the grind stops being so bad if you like dungeons
---
I mean realistically you’ll spend most of 52-60 in dungeons farming Pre-Bis. So in reality, it’s just those 3-4 levels you have to get while being a target to level 60s. And if it gets bad, you can always level those few levels in dungeons too. 
---
I don’t think people will quit because of this.
---
We did 1h6min from entering to Rag dead. We thought the timer started when we pulled, so we stood around buffing, talking etc between entering and pulling. So we probably could get it below 1h. 
---
And this is a raid with a boomkin, feral tank, shadowpriest, smite priests, prot pala tank and retri paladin... Just the ony head alone is such a huge buff. The DM buffs are not so great for casters, prefer songflower there.
---
They definitely are not the minority on Faerlina lol...
---
Ask frost mages
---
Yeah my guild is full of people who play for fun, thankfully. We’ve even got about 3 Ret pallies who raid with us.
---
calm down princess. i didn't mention glancing blows because i didn't need to. once you reach 308, you're reached the threshold for reducing glancing blow impact on your dps. so 308 is still the skill cap regardless.
---
you're right, at 305 skill = 6% hit cap, down from 9% at 300 skill. my bad about that one. doesn't excuse you for acting like a tremendous chode.
---
a lot of people do give a fuck where you put your dick moron
---
Level 48 Mage here. I should be level 51 but I read this long ass post instead.
---
There is zero misinterpretation because you're denying the objective reality of your own comment. There is no way to misinterpret it, don't lie to yourself, just read the comment. You can have multiple positions on the same point all you want but you can't say they're all the exact same.
---
Even 1 year is still extremely fast for the entirety of vanilla content.
---
In what world are you struggling to find groups as a tank? You either suck or don't have chat opened.
---
Honestly healers DPSing when healing isn't necessary helps the group more than sitting there twiddling thumbs
---
Awesome, what sort of stuff do you edit and what software do you use? I literally just edit as I go along and think of different audio samples from the top of my head then download from YouTube using a converter :)
---
41 go to ZF? would that not be too low?
---
PvE server.
---
How exactly is the only heal I can cast when moving (that isnt on an hour cooldown) not useful in world PvP or when soloing? And what alternative would be better? 2% more damage with two handed weapons? Sanctity aura?
---
**"I currently have a horde character on Faerlina and was looking to make an alliance toon. "**
---
Ok... I've been down this path. It resulted in me leaving a lvl 40 character behind, going back to faerlina, deleting my lvl 60 Horde, and starting again on Faerlina.
---
You can not leave this server. No other server will even come close. You will find yourself LFG for 2-3 hours during prime time.
---
You have 2 options:
---
1. Delete your Horde.
---
2. Start a new Account.
---
**Stay on Faerlina, Trust me....**
---
Earth shock
---
New class, bot bounty hunter.
---
I think this is probably their plan. Condense the timeline enough to where Classic will keep most people subbed until the new expansion. Then in the drought of content after the expansion hits release TBC Classic/Classic+ to keep everyone subbed.
---
Good on you. Death to streamers.
---
Exactly.
---
I don’t think you understand what I’m saying at all... nobody cares if you’re gay or straight we’re all just playing a fucking video game like old mw2 lobbies people just talk shit to talk it cause it’s the internet I’m sorry you’re salty buns
---
You get in combat when aiding the flight master I guess
---
I thought Wrathgate was a usurping attempt, that Sylvanas wasn't going to use that.
---
You could definitely still use Emergency Monitor and Decursive until 2.0 hit, so the rank selection stuff probably still worked.
---
Thing is there was enough lag that cancelling overheals and selecting ranks was never something you could automate that well.
---
Kurinaxx is Poppin.
---
it IS minmaxing, just without the work. doesn’t matter if you disagree with the concept.
---
Infact, Look at the Post below this one lol... He cant find a group on Whitemane.
---
I disagree. 3 Months is a perfect amount of time between releases.
---
aight ill just pay for 2 subs xd
---
It's common usage on Reddit to be a dog whistle to ethno-imperialist white supremacists, it's in reference to those specific subreddits.
---
You never heard of curse client?
---
Sometimes if you arent in the main raid squad those types of guilds just dont care about you. Find a medium sized guild that is still recruiting roles for main squad and you will probably also become close with them running dungeons with eachother
---
For a moment i thought this was from lolgrinder reddit. The best of both my worlds!
---
You say nobody cares, and you are objectively wrong about that. Homophobia doesn't just stop existing because you say no one cares on the internet
---
I really hope they don't, but people are already being crybabies before the honor system is even out. I just don't understand rolling on a pvp server, then pissing and moaning any time pvp happens. Pve servers exist for people like this, and they can have the exact same bg experience they would on a pvp server. But no, let's just roll on the wrong kind of server and try to ruin it for the people who enjoy it.
---
Imagine how dumb it would be to see the forums flooded with people who rolled on pve servers complaining that they can't kill people in the open world. That is exactly how I view the people complaining about phase 2.
---
So would you say not to roll on the quick strike band as well ?
---
Barely a difference.... So you admit there is a difference.
---
Come to Faerlina.
---
Trust me.
---
Shift + warstomp just before a heal goes off...
---
*these hills sing meme*
---
Nothing else gets my priest panties wet like a perfectly timed shift-stomp just before my gheal pops... mmm mmm tasty
---
You can probably make it look like you have all talents at max rank if you wanted to.
---
The incendosaurs under thorium point had insane respawn rate
---
Here’s another reason: I don’t need anything from end game dungeons. So why join PUGS? Rather just level an alt.
---
Tell that to the dps shamans always using earth shock.  I'd let them tank it if it wasn't habit to taunt shit that I lose agro of.  Honestly I'd let a shaman try out tanking just to see if it'd work.  It's nice playing the game in different ways.
---
Little trick I learned way back in the day with bots. If you're not flagged for pvp already, flag up. The bot will attack you thinking you're a mob. Kill him. Rinse and repeat.
---
AT LEAST I CAN TAB OUT NOW UNLIKE 2005 WHEN ALT TABBING WAS A FOUR MINUTE ROUND TRIP!
---
Progress baby.
---
I’ve done this with those gold spamming bs channels
---
Org vanilla had a ton of dumb stuff. Have you ever heard of an Out of Combat Rezzer? It is someone who would intentionally stay OOT so they could rezz people with their normal rezz.
---
You wont notice much of a difference. Take your time if you want, theres so many people playing that are new and similar to your situation, seriously you wont notice it much.
---
Which is what I'm saying and why I say to just follow markings instead of telling new players that it's fine to go attack your own thing to build up combo points as long as you aren't taking damage.  
---
Those kicks and extra dps can be very important. Just follow the markings.
---
You two forgot about the most important p2 addition; K E Y R I N G !
---
This is some serious boomer shit right here.
---
Hey man I leveled a rogue and found the same issues at time check out this guide         
---
classic wow.live  very helpful you fill out your info and it tells you step for step if you need any assistance
---
I almost forgot. Is there a way to incorporate Mouseover with this? Would i do a [@mouseover] before HT? Could I also incorporate a downgraded HT with a shift modifier? and a Wrath cast w/out a mouseover mod?
---
But this is only a thing on PvP servers right? I’m on a PvE and P2 won’t really change much as far as I can tell.
---
Lol, thanks for sharing :-)
---
I glanced through the comments and didn't see this, but if you are fighting 1v1 against mobs, the WW axe is slow enough that you can easily fit a slam in during its swing timer and that is far more efficient than using heroic strike.
---
There is a long cooldown between being able to get the buff. As the other guy said 8 hours. If another guild pops it then it doesn't matter when you drop the head because you won't get the buff. The only proper way to make sure you get it is communicate with every guild that has done ony and pick a time. When there are well over 15+ guilds and multiple pug groups that do it, it becomes next to impossible to coordinate.
---
Looks like burning steps have most spawn points of the 4 that Can provide black lotus! Ive tried to
---
Match older guides with newer youtube clips to
---
Match spawnpoints! And Ive Had most luck in epl and winterspring!
---
Well there's many reasons and you cant blame people we had no time line and life happens. Most likely thought they'd reach 60 in time, at least those around 50. 
---
If it's as bad as people say it will be I expect we will lose players who feel they cant progress or its a frustrating experience. Likely a lot of posts about the issue will show up as well. My guess is they'll push p3 up to resolve along with the fact on PvE servers p2 brings very little and people who are already just raid logging will stop playing.
---
Imho Blizz should've given us a rough time line or a time line subject to change. It would alleviate some of these threads each time around by those it hits the hardest.
---
Not the same asshat and you know it.
---
I DID FORGET OMG.
---
Well thanks for the info I’ll be installing it tonight. :)
---
Genius
---
Fucking nerd
---
No one has mentioned Wind Serpents which I’ve found to be a really great pet. They have high damage, a ranged lightning attack (which reduces downtime between targets), and most importantly they eat mage food (so if you have a mage friend, feeding them is free)!
---
But in reality, you can tame whatever pet you want. Everything will work, so choose what you like the look of most! Only start worrying about particular pet types when you begin to get closer to max level.
---
No it won't, it means that every single zone will have to be rebalanced, every piece of gear rebalanced, every single dungeon and it's mechanics, etc will ALL have to be rebalanced from the ground up. They'll also have to completely rebalance leveling speed to not be absolutely glacial if they're effectively cutting the games progression indicator in over half.  This also means every single BG is going to either have to be rebalanced leveling wise or be an absolute shit show that'll end up a complete fucking mess of power differences in each bracket. Anyone that thinks "level squish" is a good idea is just a dumbass.
---
This has been going on since 2004.
---
It was sometime during Org Vanilla. I can't pinpoint you to when though. It was removed either late vanilla or with TBC. 
---
Original WoW API allowed for so much stuff it was insane. It was so insane, that with todays addon people, you could've made an addon that plays the entire game for you.
---
&gt; What are mages for?
---
AoEing even on single targets.
---
Be part of the group that camps and gets first hit in in boss just like everything else... and hope a horde guild doesn’t own you all and retag it.
---
Wait I do use thorns is there a joke here in missing( feral tank)
---
&gt; Okay, this does not explain the dozens of end game hunters who haven't named it. 
---
You notice people who don’t more than those that do in spite of their smaller numbers because it bothers you. 
---
&gt; And naming it literally does not increase ur attatchment.
---
[literally objectively false.](https://www.thecut.com/2017/11/the-psychology-of-giving-human-names-to-your-stuff.html)
---
&gt; But again, kinda silly to play a pet based class and never bother with it.
---
“Never bothering with it” would be literally not taming a pet, or not taming higher level pets to get better skills. Not naming it might be “not engaging” with it, but it certainly isn’t not bothering.
---
&gt; but no one has told me a decent reason as to why hunters aren't naming their pets very often if at all
---
Anecdotal. Take a tally of every hunter you see with a pet out out, one column for named, one for unnamed. I would be *shocked* if the named column wasn’t significantly fuller than the unnamed after you’ve seen a few dozen hunters.
---
If you're an experienced player and know that your tank is dumb, then I'd recommend trying to educate them as to why something else should be the kill priority.
---
But if we're just telling new players, "As long as you're using Evasion or stuns to avoid taking a lot of damage you're good" then I want to make sure they know that's not cool.
---
For example, some people had like 4fps in raids. So they could hardly play any normal way.
---
You're going to need to post where you're getting your info from man. After mid WoD Blizz cracked down really hard on bots like Honorbuddy (the biggest commercial bot to date). 
---
Was the d3 thing before or after necro launched?
---
I farmed plague lands all week n never saw a drop.
---
I’m on Windseeker and it is very good. Seems like a solid community, a few very strong guilds, and just a general atmosphere of friendliness and fun.
---
Neutral guards interact based on your combat status. So if you enter combat to help someone fight they see you as fighting. Once you leave combat they won't attack you anymore.
---
Start at the source. Uninstall your network drivers and download new ones. Drivers can become corrupt.
---
If it was a cute girl who sent that message i would have spiraled in depression and lonliness
---
Glad i dodged that bullet
---
Willitclassic is a good resource for all addons bc it provides links for addons whether they be on curseforge or other sites
---
Cool story bro.
---
Pick any retail :p
---
If you are cool with a pvp server you are cool with a pvp server.  Sometimes you will get killed for no reason.  Sometimes you will get camped.  Sometimes you will help the enemy leave them be when you could have destroyed them and they will turn around and kill you.  Just roll with the punches/make an alt to level full rested xp while your main is camped.
---
I'm just gonna switch games, friend wants me to play PoE so I guess I'm not subbing next month.
---
The last part hit a little close to home :p
---
If you can't find reasons to come back to classic, why would others do?
---
Nah, you'll probably spend more money leveling enchanting then you would just buying the enchants you want. Engineering is great and you need the required engineering level to use the good stuff.
---
Not proc rate, dps boost.
---
I worded it that way for a reason.
---
With the proc rate considered, the weapon has a ~~5-6%~~ 4% higher dps than an EQUAL sword without the proc.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dhs7kf/thrash_blade_proc_rate_is_379_4k_hits_experiment/
---
If you nolifed then you didn't play chill... lol.
---
Started with Avid in broadcasting. I work at a creative ad agency now, and do 90% Adobe 10% Davinci. I think it's the ability to think of sound references off the top of your head is a serious skill.
---
Except when there are more than six mobs than demo shout produces more threat than battle shout.
---
that doesnt make it not rude or excuse them.
---
I’ve started to lose faith myself. 
---
They’ve basically decided that since they were proven wrong about us wanting classic, that they’ll just rush patches until it’s last phase and then call it a day with a “here , we gave you classic, now go back to shittail” remark.
---
Yea, a quick renew when you have the mana is nice but other than that I expect no heals while life tapping.
---
I don't get it.
---
People play like that now    
---
* Frost Mages just press Frostbolt
---
* Warlocks just press Shadowbolt
---
Screw everybody else.   /s
---
But cries with noone to share my monitors
---
I have to agree. And the community with classic feels more welcoming
---
It’s right on par with what I think most of us expected. The assumption has always been Nov-Dec for P2. There is absolutely no real content in it. It doesn’t create a situation where people start to feel like they are left behind(which I don’t think is possible with classic but that won’t stop others). They definitely couldn’t hold it until after the new year. 
---
Frankly I’m not sure how you could view it as too early.
---
Wat
---
Hey Bud.
---
Played till lvl 20 on classic. Found myself getting into the same habits so quickly so I quit. It wasn’t worth it.
---
I find browsing classic wow reddit is a sort of methadone. 
---
But stay strong.
---
For MC and BWL definitely
---
Nope.
---
Few questions about the server is it pretty even ally v horde and also is there many guilds with alot of members based in est time.
---
I think you’re going to be the worst healer but you could probably do it.
---
&gt; That and dungeon itemization for leveling hunters is really bad. People want to roll on SOMETHING, so if no loot is really good for them, they end up rolling on some weird +int or proc on hit sword.
---
Tell me about it. I feel like basically the only thing I get from dungeons are agility capes, though at least some quest rewards can be used for a while. I feel like I used triprunner dungarees for an embarrassingly long time. There are some bows and guns that can drop in dungeons but it feels like almost all of them are at abyssal rates where you might as well just buy it off the auction house.
---
That said, despite all this I very rarely actually hit need (at least thus far up to mid-50s) even to roll on "something". As long as a group is reasonable I tend to get a decent share of greens from party all greed rolls, as well as some money from dungeon quests and general mob drops. I'm so used to getting "nothing" and recently I had a Zul'Farrak run where I won the majority of greed rolls, such that I actually felt bad if people thought I was need spamming when I actually wasn't at all. Don't even know if I hit need on anything in the whole dungeon.
---
Just as bad as trading a rogue a lockbox with no prior communication
---
Dps comp or tank doesn’t matter much now with all the info we have. I’m hoping I can get closer to an hour from start to finish. The less I play the better imo.
---
But where is heal rank 4
---
Hey everybody look at the idiots who wronged me then I spam whispered the guy "who is the spoiled kid now?" and now I want to show the internet that I'm a normal and chill guy and others are mean.
---
All about the blessing of protection.
---
It's not skirmishes which will shake things up, it's people like me killing every lvl48+ on sight whereas before I'd completely ignore them.
---
Halloween is over my man
---
Still have nightmares about learning AS-11 using Avid at uni lol. I personally use Vegas for content like this. All those years of browsing memes has finally amounted to something
---
Luna has heal predictions which is really helpful for raids with lots of healers as you can see exactly who is casting on who.  There is a addon you can get that works similar to Luna's heal prediction but it doesn't work with many other custom Unit Frames.
---
VuhDo is just really good for progression raiding on retail, highly customizable.
---
Break the cycle. Try ffxiv. Shit load of content, best profession system, can pay a reduced sub fee to have only 1 character per server(one can be every class and profession, bonus xp given based on current level vs your highest). Better community.  Just left and ain’t comin back
---
I haven't seen that issue. 6 raids, only 1 piece of loot, and it was worse than the blue I was wearing.
---
it doesn't help that mc/ony loot is ass for druids, resto or otherwise
---
This. A disappointment to his ancestors.
---
Isnt it obvious that those who work harder want to be more rewarded than lazy ppl
---
People who make this jump are level 60. People who don’t are still level 20 and complain about how there no LFG.
---
I never said it meant you had no life. But I AM saying that it’s very unreasonable to expect a regular person to be able to dedicate that much time to this game.
---
And in your example, you’d get home a little after 5. Make dinner, etc. and be spending like an hour or less with your SO a day realistically. That is not a healthy relationship.
---
Well yeah, it's not convenient. But speed clearing is a competition. If we just wanted to get the content done it's no big deal, but to try and clear faster than the next guys? Extra work needs to be done
---
Can't speak for pally, I agree on almost nothing. Except hunters, why are hunters always out of ammo? I'm always out of ammo on my hunter alt too but at 60 you should've learned that 3 quivers of ammo is barely enough.
---
Minimum work, maximum output
---
you have to fuck with the settings a bit but vuhdo is great for classic too
---
Saw a dude named Linguo and I said ‘Linguo, dead?’. To which he responded Linguo IS dead. 
---
I love this community.
---
Yeah im def more casual still at 56. Gonna hit 60 just sad im gonna get smoked in wpvp cause i didnt have enough time. Was expecting 3-4 months minimum
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Grobbulus/comments/cwn62k/beware_of_the_enclave_guild_on_alliance/
---
Lmao today was the first day I've called a bluff on a prot pally calling himself holy and said he can't tank scholo arguably one of the easier dungeons to tank
---
So what you have to split your time between consumable farming and pvp? Maybe you shouldn't have complete domination of a server as a hardcore player and maybe now there will be more nodes for more casual players.
---
Can't you just ask the other palidan?
---
What a great idea. People should just live inside BRD and look for groups for 8 long ass final levels. Don't even think about enjoying any of the outside world.
---
It's awesome that these posts are written by people who didn't level through honor system and were leading the pack so the PvP was basicaly non existent compared to what is about to come.
---
But now it's not a problem because you get to gank lower levels who don't stand a chance and get rewarded for it.
---
Rogues are best DPS and have good CC.
---
Plenty of servers without this problem, and the community seems to get better and better the fewer People there are
---
Re-read the thread. I have stated a number of times I would rather politicians focus on fixing the real issue.  This does nothing to solve anything. It is simply passing the buck onto a game company.  If you are in that political position you owe it to the electorate to actually work to sort the problems in your society.  I've said this a few times in a number of different ways. Frankly you seem to wish to find fault in my posts for the sake of it, least I hope that's it as I don't believe you actually want systematic underground racism.
---
I did it myself when leveling in classic and used Titan Panels xp/hr measuring, as long as you know what you're doing it's doable.
---
https://i.imgur.com/Y6UmrTc.jpg Memoria automatically does screenshots when you level up and you can see here we had around 75k/hr, at some point we did hit the 100s though.
---
Because having enchanting on your main character has far less benefit than other professions unless you have other players feeding you specific enchants.
---
Yes, it'll wipe even with the same name. But everything is there in saved variables. That's why he/she needs to copy everything from his old servers folders to the new server folder. Profiles will all still be there regardless
---
So he definitely has developed a reputation! What are people reporting? Is there anything in the thread or other threads which is damning for him in wow? I don't doubt the reason he has a reputation, but what I would be surprised of(and doubt) is that he says overtly racist and completely reprehensible stuff in general or w/e and multiple people him report him for it, and nothing happens. If that's the case then Blizzard customer service must be dead O.o
---
Poor translations are the funniest shit sometimes
---
Yes you will. With that and mage armour and taking a magic potion, the one that gives you 50 resistance to all magic schools you will getting loads loads of mana during rag
---
Heyo, I suggest you visit warrior discord and there you can find sim sheet. You input your gear and buffs and get dps you would make. Im on mobile so i don't have it on me now, if you're not into discord then i believe googling for the spreadsheet should work too.
---
Also i think dalrends should be slightly better yeah.
---
Edit missclicks
---
Best spot to mindlessly grind as a level 54 warrior? I tried western plaguelands but it’s so crowded with aoe mages and I had to eat after every other mob.
---
That's now Twitch.
---
I, on the other hand, got 2 in about 100 kills. Not saying it isn't low, but rng is involved. It was def higher than than the journeyman bag.
---
I know right? Deluded people think phase 2 trinkets mean the end of fears lol. All that means is doing double fears
---
In winterspring north eastern edge i believe. Got stuck there trying to get to a thorium node and had to hearth out
---
Grid2 has heal prediction too. I sometimes offheal and it's nice knowing the main healer has a big heal incoming on the tank so I don't overheal.
---
If you're fury its not such a small upgrade and the two best you can farm right now are rivemspike and boneslicing hatchet.
---
August or September 2020 I bet.
---
I’ll be damned if I ever PvE or PvP as a mage without ice block.
---
The survivability it adds is a huge tangible benefit that doesn’t show up in damage charts.
---
And the dungeons aren’t hard enough to warrant dropping it for a tiny output increase.
---
Google something called "hyper spawns". A guild member was telling me there are certain areas that immediately spawn mobs once all the mobs at that camp are dead. The only one I've ever grind at was a defoas camp near sentinel point in westfall. There are more. I just dont know them.
---
Just because you personally didn’t play like this likely because you were too young or not in a guild that did it doesn’t mean others didn’t. The whole “classic was supposed to be about people not trying or caring” is just a total and complete myth of personal experiences and not the entire wow community back then. Our raid/class leads used to make shamans drop mana tide before raid, they made warriors use bloodthirst so they were checking if arms. None of this stuff is needed at all to clear the content obvious, but many many people enjoy the game through trying hard and having efficient clears. People acting like they are somehow sinning against the “spirit of classic” are just totally ignorant.
---
Really looking for anything to prove yourself right huh?
---
He said twitch, so whether he's heard of curse or not, he's heard of the current state of curse.
---
Because micro transactions
---
k, but like 90% of the time no one is marking and the tank is just trying to hold aggro on like 3 guys and everyone is ignoring the healing mob in the back. If a rogue is fucking up a caster who will cause problems while the group is doing something else, that's pretty good. For the most part it's pretty situational
---
I have almost no trouble finding groups that let me res the book because they 1) want to just get going and dont want to sit for an hour looking for a tank and 2) usually understand that even if the book is worth 1k, it has a nonexistant drop chance and will likely not be an issue during a run. At this point, Im nearly raid geared and have zero reason to run DM apart from that book. If I dont get a res on it, I may as well just not run since it isnt worth the 20 mins running out there, 30-40 mins clearing, for a 2% drop chance that I have to roll 5 people for. Im sure there are other tanks out there that will go, but again, youll likely be on LFG for 30+ mins trying to find one.
---
I'm level 40 now and the only need I've done has been that green BOP halberd in Deadmines.
---
Ask your guild. Let them know what your intentions are and just be willing to adapt if needed. Tbh it is expensive to pvp and raid if you want to cross specs but its doable by most people who play 20-40 hours a week. You just have to delegate time appropiately.
---
Southshore vs Tarren Mill is a pvp hotspot almost every night on Deviate Delight.
---
I had a Mage in ZF try to charge for food and water as I got a whisper he just Ninja'd a item from his last group :)
---
Interrupts on princess heal was the only problems we had. We had a 60 warlock with us. But once we got the dps straightened  on when to interrupt, we killed emp with princess up no problem.
---
As a mage, I never charge my group for water/food. I consider it one of the things I bring to the group in the same way that a priest brings stamina buffs or a shaman brings reincarnation resses after a wipe.
---
About the aoeing though, I think that might be because everyone and their grandmother demands that you specc frost and single target dps as frost is boring as shit. I leveled as fire just because then I could have interesting single target gameplay. As a result I'd only aoe if it was really worth it. Had no complaints about my playing from level 1-56 (where I am right now).
---
I also do this to my husband. If I have to run and pay attention, so do you! :P
---
As a Holy Paladin, I feel personally attacked at how accurately you've described me :(
---
If people weren't stupid/selfish/petty enough to do that it wouldn't be a problem in the first place. He's fundamentally unable to come to that realization.
---
I honestly don't really care what anyone does, it doesn't warrant the witch Hunt (which is against the rules). This is coming from someone that won't play with a douche bag. If someone's a dick, I leave group even if it means I don't get a group for the rest of my night. I am still firmly against slandering them on Reddit.
---
So if I level up a New character I can get geared decently for late raids like AQ 40 with mc gear ?
---
I'm on a PvP server and I skipped it. Figure the talent points are more useful else where especially since I'm still lvling. I dont kite anything, I drain tank all right to the face
---
Syntax was very different but it existed in the 1.x client.
---
You jump and do a 180.
---
I don't think you understand what projecting means, but whatever. Your comment didn't trigger anyone, what you said though is that because it is happening in a representatives' state means that he shouldn't pursue the issue elsewhere.
---
And then you denied that you said that, when you immortaized it on the internet, and now you're once again denying that you said it. 
---
I'm not even talking about how backwards and stupid your original comment is, I'm now onto the point of you actually denying you said something when it's still up proving that you said something which you're now saying you're not. Any perceived superiority that you think I'm expressing is just you being unable to defend whatever it is you're trying to prove. 
---
That's why you're being excessively downvoted, not because you said something outrageously stupid (you did) but that you immediately denied that you said it when it's clear you did. ￼
---
&gt; The problem all healers face is that sooner or later they need to farm stuff and need spellpower or AP gear.
---
In most cases raiding tanks/healers 'farm' via running instances because even if optimally geared their dps specs aren't particularly good for farming.
---
I can understand your frustration that other players have their primary spec prioritized over your off-spec, but this is the norm in most raiding guilds.
---
Man the vanishes fail all the time when I do pick pocket farming
---
That addon existed on pservers but wasnt widely known but just by a few.
---
Im not telling the name of such addon thoug
---
 Why not simply ask them ?
---
See, when he spends his time camping someone who literally has no way to fight back it's fine. But if they manage to get a group together to cause him any trouble then they should kill themselves.
---
Fucking narcissists.
---
Classic Codex should let you search for all the items and link them, but you cant do it directly by chat as far as I know
---
If you join a group for a dungeon just start making your way to the instance. It isn't the group's job to make sure you are paying attention and you shouldn't need to be told to start moving. If you ask for a group invite and immediately go afk you are being a dick.
---
What is the normal leveling spec for paladin if you don’t plan on tanking? Ret and holy hybrid?
---
how is dispelling an effect on himself firing back? by that logic, if I had myself in gadget, it should aggro the guards
---
And interacting with others ?? Are ypu crazy ?
---
AND you have so many friends now.
---
^ this guy means NugRunning lol
---
Damn undead are so ugly
---
Thanks for giving insight on this, I think I will disuade against it.
---
One thing I loved to do on my Death Knight Scribe in Wrath of the Lich King was buff people with scrolls I crafted. You can't buff others as a few classes but when they added Inscription you suddenly could, it was fun.
---
3. Is doing Strat Live and gets charged and clapped by the shield dude
---
Retail can be summarised as they removed anything that was inconvenient, causing the game to be diluted, added too many rewards which made the game feel unrewarding. 
---
They did add some good things, but overall just ruined the experience.
---
/gquit also has the same effect
---
Wait so you haven't build a disk drive back into your computer to install it with 5 cd-roms?
---
btw. what kind of cavemen still used 56k modem in 2004?
---
This is actually really cool and imaginative!
---
Kurinaxx feels close to 50 50
---
Interesting. I've tried it out and it works good. Everthing is done in battle stance i presume? How about when I get whirlwind and later mortal strike? thanks!
---
Healing is fking boring. You cant even see whats going on, staring at green bars and cds.
---
Cant wait to heal in PVP in phase 2
---
modern games require immense skill, modern wow requires more individual skill than classic bro
---
i think you are wrong. prove me wrong.
---
The original memes are all getting banned by the shite admins though.
---
Shhh, you're bring sense into a circlejerk.
---
As soon as they have their gear they toss us away like yesterdays jam. I love my pre raid bis geared tank, but can't find a raid spot. Why should I keep playing it?
---
Rogue’s offer top dps soooo
---
It's also actually a really strong comp for that level. Melee cleave xp rate is awesome prior to level 50ish.
---
TIL I don't play for fun
---

good luck filling a group with anyone who has a clue. because anyone who has a clue wouldn't run with someone basically reserving an epic mount.
---
Could be a medical condition, lack of sleep, genetics, new contacts etc.
---
You know you're with a good warlock if his pet aggro something out of combat.
---
beta was capped at 40
---
In the epic staff quest for priests where u get benediction/anthema staff. Is that a permenat choice or can you later on switch between them ?
---
Druids dont even have tree form in vanilla :(
---
All of this is true except for the Priest stuff... yes I play a Priest....
---
We had a paladin just for that. What else was he gonna do?
---
Fhuk hugh
---
Welcome to Vanilla. This is the ultimate fate of Classic after Naxxramas has been out for months. It'll be impossible to do any group PvE content after enough time has passed.
---
It's the reason why all p-servers relied on hard realm resets to keep the community active.
---
They give no xp. They havent 2 weeks into Release and they don’t now,
---
I play on Fairbanks and it feels like 60-40 horde.
---
Shamans stomp my mage and I hate it
---
Of course RNG is involved, and stating that the odds are better than that of farming a journeyman bag based on 100 kills is nonsensical.
---
I farmed Dreaming whelps for 1.5 levels pre-40 without getting a whelpling, based on that they have a pretty shitty drop chance (which is the case), but when I later on did some Blindweed circuits I killed the 2 live ones I saw when riding past and I got one. Your statement is basically the same as saying that the drop rate is much better, around 50% even, if you farm them between level 40-50 rather than pre 40.
---
I dont' think you read the full comment. "I'd like to finish leveling" "a lot of quitters from the pre-60 players"
---
He didn't say he didn't want to pvp, he said he doesnt watn to get blasted by max level players while he is still leveling - which could be fixed by releaseing BGs to get people to farm honor there rather then in the world
---
If you're in a decent guild you won't get a mageblade until all the casters and the caster alts have one.
---
No real Guild Uses dkp so thsts Why he asked lol
---
Filthy Alli
---
But people who are playing Classic for 6+ months are incredibly unlikely to play retail.
---
Got 2 on Thursday and 2 on Friday. Haven’t played today tho
---
I can’t wait for the day a Mage refuses to give me water. I’ll just have to think of different way to conserve mana hmm I guess the mage doesn’t need any heals.
---
Play on a PvE/RP server. I'm on a RP server, if I'll want to PvP in BGs I'll be able to do that, I did not want to spend a single second of my time getting camped by some neckbeard tryhard and due to my choices, it's never going to happen. 
---
But if you did choose to roll on a PvP server.. why are you complaining? Like what's even the point? Complaining for the sake of complaining? You knew this would happen, that there would be people who level faster than you and some of them will want to camp you. Hell, it doesn't even have anything to do with Phase 2, people who want to do that are ALREADY doing that, and have been doing it since like week 2 or 3. 
---
The reason people aren't agreeing with you is because this whole "Oh woe is me" thing rings so false: Anyone could've told you this is what you'd get, you could have taken action to avoid it - I know I did.
---
You hear him slam his mouse into his desk when he dies, hes mad.
---
modern wow has the option to play hard wow but also has more handholding than before
---
Feralas Hinterlands Searing gorge
---
That was incredibly entertaining!
---
I like both although I have barely touched retail since classic came out. I know I will play retail a lot more once I get to 60 in classic since I have no plans to try to raid. 
---
I main a warrior in retail but hate how warriors play in classic. I love my rogue in classic but hate how they changed them in retail.
---
A blue item completely revamped into an epic for 1.1
---
Does the Shaman have something to be Immune at Poly or Fear?
---
Mega casuals should not give a shit about the honor grind since they wont get higher than rank 2
---
Classic theoretically has an ending.
---
Are you looking at the same image I'm looking at? They give around 20 xp per kill and you can pull a SHIT TON of them. They also basically instantly respawn, with the strategy I told you about you can easily hit 100k with practice.
---
Are you really that dense that you don't even know that systematic racism can't be underground? If it's underground then the people who are racist no longer have any power. 
---
Blizzard by enabling players to be racist for 15 fucking years is creating an environment for systematic racism to thrive. 
---
And I told you, this IS how a politician focuses on fixing the issue because it helps stop spreading this fucking ideology to other people.
---
The only thing you have suggested they do is focus on other stuff without actually saying what the other stuff fucking is.
---
That is the problem with your fucking points, they don't have one.
---
Amen!
---
Tho there are some macros that are useful (spammable), I can see this kind of setup being useful only in two scenarios. 
---
a) To someone who has a MMO mouse, and can bind ctrl/alt/shift to side buttons
---
b) a clicker
---
I really hope that OP has a MMO mouse
---
I think it's mostly due to stress and the pressure you put on yourself to go back to your former glory.   I pugged my first MC raid about a month ago and everything went well up to Rag.
---
First wipe wasn't my fault but me dying as a healer in the first 3 minutes didn't help and put me in the radar.  (One of the officer whispered me)
---
We walk back to  get in position and they says : "Whatever you do just don't Target Rag it will activate him" so I walked with my camera pointing the ground heading towards the tank/melee because I am Shaman heal.  Well being in melee range also aggro Rag so I make the raid Wipe
---
So on the third attempt I basically RP walk my way to the melee group to make sure I wouldn't fuck up (I was receiving insult in whisper) but I stayed right on them for some reason.  Put totem down and they start the fight.  Of course, Rag target me and bounce the whole melee group.  Everyone was so hypnotised by my RP walk and insulting me that they ALL forgot I was going to be focused by bouncing fire ball.  So I made the group wipe again.  I felt like shit. So much pressure and stress.  
---
Forward 3 weeks, I have a super nice and comprehensive guild that explained me every detail of MC.  I am 6/8 T1 gear and I'm the designated T1 Resto shaman of the guild. Well respected and nobody could guess I single-handly prevented a guild to kill Rag. 
---
The pressure make a whole world of difference.  Before you were confident and sharp and now you doubt everything you do wich impair your senses ... Just take it easy, one step at the time and it's gonna be like muscle memory.
---
Hey  I 4 man'd BRD in moonkin spec as a healer... but we were also all 60... and geared. 
---
Warriors and their ironfoe obsession
---
This sub is super casual holy shit lmao
---
2-3 hours a day is kind of a lot lol
---
Yes mostly ret.
---
I checked out Kromcrush
---
It's a really friendly community  horde and alliance too it seems
---
Sucks its east coast
---
Ah okay no I dont do that xD
---
You're doing God's work.  Horde is always camping blackrock mountain. As an alliance player it adds that extra bit of excitement knowing that there's almost a guaranteed conflict when I come in.
---
If you only have $5 spare after paying bills then maybe a subscription based game isn't another financial commitment you need right now.
---
Yeah of course, everyone is honorless until phase 2! /s
---
Yeah thats 100% news to me. My cousin has had a slogan on his twitter saying "why can't we be frens" for about 5 years now. Honestly people should stop giving every single thing to the 4chan morons. They love it. Just like that damn frog. The poor creator of it must be going nuts because it was stolen from him in such a way.
---
Grats man. I got it back in vanilla, had the sinew drop for me already and now I just need the leaf. Fond memories of that quest, looking forward to experiencing it again!
---
That's pretty much the wow community entirely
---
But there are pockets of really generous people. Just got to find them and get them to like you
---
Did you camp though?
---
I hope you camped. Hard.
---
Wait youre saying if om a tank i can get PAID for grouping?
---
Tanked a group recently, (I'm druid) and I get in last  and there is already two druids. I was ashamed, just tank you lazy gits.
---
Congratulations.
---
Quit after Wrath, back for classic. I haven’t heard of anything since... whenever WotLK was.
---
What class?
---
&gt; Retail can be summarised as they removed anything that was inconvenient, causing the game to be diluted,
---
I don't completely agree. They added a lot of inconvenient features in order to keep people playing.
---
At some point their 'data analysts' realized that players who log in every day are more likely to renew their subscription. So they put in a bunch of daily quests to keep people logging in. Over the years this expanded to things like the world quests, or emissaries or what I consider to be the worst of the worst, Azerite power.
---
What they didn't consider is the people who are more likely to resubscribe log in every day because they enjoy the game, not because of some reward system. They didn't make players WANT to log in every day, they made it so players feel like they're falling behind if they DON'T log in every day. They made the game into a chore.
---
Forcing me to log in to do content I don't want to do over and over and over will drive even the most dedicated players away eventually. I hate all the systems in retail designed to keep me on the treadmill running as fast as I can to stay in the same place.
---
There is also the duskwood horde quest.
---
Elemental shaman shaman
---
Yeah dude! I haven’t played WoW since Wrath, so if anything was a thing I only know of it since Classic came out hahaha
---
I'm kinda new to this game and this comment just made me realize something, can't you camp the corpse and the graveyard than?
---
The 1 button name is awesome
---
someone likes to complain
---
How long can all members of a party be logged out before party gets removed
---
go back to facebook
---
That’s exactly what pve servers are for. Or live in dungeons til youre 60. It didn’t take half a brain to realize that before choosing the server you want to play on. They gave a roadmap that informed people there wouldn’t be BGs til phase 3. Sorry people couldn’t figure out world pvp was going to happen for a whole phase
---
Not old blanchy lemme tellyawhut
---
BWL you need onyxia scale cloak to not wipe for one boss. Also a min fire resist for melees is like 150 or so. everyone needs a min of 100
---
great point
---
yeah that would be a good starter
---
Gladiator chain obsession! Warriors are weird
---
Apparently my world.
---
Warrior is the most played class and any warrior can tank so it's not like tanks are in high demand.
---
Cant suck at something u been playing for half your life. You can be washed up but not suck.
---
Thanks for the unprompted example of what a dog whistle looks like and how people try to turn innocuous symbols into coded language while maintaining plausible deniability amongst people that don't understand the meme culture
---
For reference, clownworld is an alt-right catchphrase, and lo and behold this one that used it apparently frequents T_D, what a coincidence
---
Other than that do I need mc gear ?
---
Im actually really surprised to hear how bad ally seems to be when horde is so awesome
---
Cries in sageblade
---
Just post a PVP video, no need for made up reasons
---
Faulty PSU can result into random PC crash because some of your of component don't have electricity anymore.
---
Sometimes, opening your case and doing a big clean up (vacuum / air compressor) can really help, specially if you run into overheating problem.
---
I'd sooner die than use my health potion before I really need it.
---
Vuhdo also has heal prediction on classic.

Edit: phone....

https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/elemental-shaman-dps-gear-bis-classic-wow
---
These would be a great place to start
---
im searching for a non-full pvp us-west server to play on, at the moment i'm considering: netherwind, benediction, kromcrush and skeram
---
could someone that plays on any of these servers tell how's the experience specially the faction balance?
---
Yeah, Lucky that you had nobody to Roll against lol!
---
Thanks 
---
But also not sure that last part is 100% true, I’m pretty sure Shadow Mastery is the base power, whereas demonic sacrifice is after spell power?
---
But resilience is terrible for the game
---
i loved the randy marsh hot hot hot
---
My existence does make people uneasy for some reason.
---
Ppl have told me they hate me simply because of how I talk.
---
You might be right.
---
There is a dps check boss, you want to maximise your dps. You should have any gear that can get from MC to aid with this. You should have your t2 pieces at least. Elemental shaman is ass for raids, most good gear comes from aq40. You need to really invest into consumables to make sure you're pulling your weight.
---
Camping lowbies is the dumbest shit.
---
Like yeah you sure owned that guy who can't even poke you
---
So that matches what I said, stuff that was in 1.9 and got buffed in 1.10 is in its 1.10 state.
---
Death ray van hit for up to 2k on people so in 2v1s yea it’s worth.
---
Awh no dont do this I'm 24 and wanna be away from the zoomers as well
---
Source? It's funny how many comments can be made about this without one single source.
---
Still can't believe that Sylvanas could just win a one-on-one against The Lich King... He's THE LICH KING for crying out loud!
---
Try explaining heart of the wild spec to the 5 man dps groups.
---
What do you mean you can tank AND heal?  You simply cant...
---
I've given up convincing people now and I'm just like "yeah, I'm full resto, sure, whatever, let's go"
---
An excellent demonstration of how people misunderstand how dog whistles work and the fact that innocuous symbols are chosen exactly because they are innocuous and provide a veil of plausible deniability.
---
What's sad is that you probably posted your comment seriously
---
Our Warriors need their Support Leader of the Pack aura or they just don’t feel happy
---
he said in vid, that footage is invalid
---
Getting BC and WOTLK would make me want to play a lot more. Right now I play as little as I can in classic and almost never touch retail.
---
You "don't agree"? If racism is mentioned in chat and is reported, they get banned. Try say the n-word in chat and have your friend report you (even if it's just in /s chat between you and him). You will either receive a month+ mute, or a temporary ban &amp; a warning.
---
I'd say try until 40 at least. If you like tanking but dont like the slog you could always try a druid.
---
Being able to swap roles and be a caster or melee dps or healer is lovely for levelling. Druids arent boring at least IMO.
---
&gt; see how good their writing actually can be (or not)
---
It's been complete garbage since WoD. There's no need to speculate the quality when we already know from 3 complete failures in a row, soon to be 4.
---
How do you just reserve one item? I'm new to the game so idk
---
Glad you got away from all that friend
---
So only hardcore players want battlegrounds? Lol... 
---
Also if you've cleared MC how are you not done with this phase? You've completed all the end-game content currently available, that seems to be the logical milestone.
---
I wouldn't say there is a "too late" in classic, short of the added pain of being camped for honor all the end game is still relevant. To do the later raids you have to be geared from the earlier ones so a lot of guilds will still be running them, most likely with open spots bc their geared players wont need to do them.
---
What does this have to do with classic wow?
---
Healers actually have the best overview of what's going on in a fight. Your tank isnt going to notice some scrub dps standing in the fire but the healers sure are gonna notice it. Anytime anyone makes a mistake the first to know is always the healers.
---
I mean of course you did. Why wouldn’t you? Need to speed up that sweet sweet rage generation to build up threat amirite?
---
Rogue is a shitty warrior straight up. I wasted so much time on my rogue I wish some one warned me. They do have high DPS, but less than warrior and practically 0 AOE ability.
---
5:20 AM .. Saturday *morning?!* Wow! What a coincidence!
---
I'm applying to a new guild called "Cute Boys" and they want a photo in my application to see if I'm cute enough. I know they have underage members so I'm wondering if this is illegal.
---
I like some of the members I've been playing with but finding this in the application makes me question the leadership.
---
Being a white supremacist isn't against any rules, expressing it is. Find me one case before this of them being reported for a racist act and getting away with it. Hint: Hasn't happened; you're lying.
---
620 km is some pretty desperate shit.
---
I guess this helps op a lot.
---
Why do you think Org is built next to a river? And the sea, for that matter. Toilets are a relatively modern creation, they'd probably use chamber pots.
---
Can u share the macro
---
I can’t speak to how fun it is playing a Shaman, but I can speak to how much Elemental Shamans hurt in PvP.
---
I don’t know many people not having fun popping people in PvP.
---
In raids, I’m sure you can find a spot with your totems being so useful, resto or otherwise.
---
Happens to me too. I have gear for both
---
I gave a guy a slab of meat for his pet. He was genuinely happy and thankful. Lol
---
More interested in PVP than raiding so it works out for me.
---
Not totally immune, but tremor totem will break fear early if you place it before the fear goes off, and grounding totem will absorb a polymorph or single-target fear. Also make use of your earth shock as an interrupt.
---
I’m confused. can’t go back to retail or can’t go back to classic?
---
TB does have the giant "soil" pile. Soil, indeed.
---
Your point only holds true if you actually think his tweet solved anything.  I don't.  Is wow magically less racist now that one players account is banned?  No.  It's assinine to think so.  Tomorrow the player will have a new account, his guild has seemingly already reformed, so what has changed here? Nothing.  Instead of focusing his energy on fixing these issue in the real world (which is why they are even present in wow anyway) the senetor instead chose to scape goat a game company via a social media platform in order to divert attention from himself for failng to fix the issue in society in the 1st place.  
---
A quick Google shows that the KKK and fascism has been increasing in his state in recent years.  So again, as he has done nothing to resolve these issues at home perhapse he should refrain from throwing stones blizzards way on this issue.  Especially given the fact he is on a far better position to enact real change than a game company.  Not sure why you are struggling so much with this tbh.  Can you not see the hypocrisy here?
---
Dude the only person who said anything about people not trying or not caring is you. 
---
Don’t tell me video games back then were about making sure your damage output was optimal down the tenths of percentage because they weren’t. 
---
Most of you people acting like it was likely weren’t there and are tryna act like you were.
---
Just because you haven't been paying attention doesn't mean nobody else has, go look through the Grobbulus sub about how many times people called Horrigan out for being racist. Shit there's people in this thread talking about how he's been a shithead racist for 20 years and now you're over here going 'please hand deliver irrefutable proof that Horrigan has been a racist in the past and people have complained about it'
---
Nobody here has an obligation to educate you, why did you even join the discussion of you don't know anything about what happened?
---
You shouldn’t be topping off warlocks

He has plenty of hotkeys set up.  I don't think there's anyone who never clicks anything.
---
Well... I just want to know why no gold spammer has messaged me ? I think it sucks they exist and plague people , would never buy gold! but think it’s even worse to be excluded , like not one channel invite ! (Checked settings) .

/only one not being harassed

I hate that for you, you should try it.

(Going over your comment history though, I’d agree)
---
Except for winter fall village...
---
Kromcrush. Good. 50/50 split. Zug zug.
---
I know you were kidding, but you're not wrong, in particular the warlocks. Your description of priests makes me feel like you have watched me play!
---
I played runescape back in 05 instead of vanilla. I love old-school runescape, but wowis a different beast. I am addicted to both. But classic has my attention now
---
Oof
---
People who hide their own name are bitches.
---
It's a macro. Bound to sinister strike.
---
Don't worry, just pick a server, your behind the pack now anyway
---
Ugly in Middle school... and still ugly in life.

Curse client was basically like iTunes, but for WoW addons. Browse your addons and install them from the client, then see your installed addons and automatically update them from the Curse client. It was around way back in Wrath (that's when I started, so not sure if it was around earlier).
---
Twitch bought out Curse (or the company that owned curse) a few years back, so all the addon shit from Curse Client is now part of the Twitch app. So if anyone says curse client, they are talking about the Twitch app (they just remember it from before it was Twitch).
---
I’ve never had a Mage charge for making water. Even outside of an instance.
---
Ok but hear me out. (I don't do this as I'm not even 60, not would I care to do this)
---
What If that's the way they enjoy to play the game? What if they do it so that people can form groups to harass them away? What if that is how they choose to RP stifling the horde/alliance?
---
I don't fault those that do it really, I have been camped myself and after the second time they kill me I just res and HS then go level somewhere else. Hell I don't get much time to play and I have lost most of an evening to having to go somewhere else.
---
If you are already maxed:
---
Take time to get a Cloak of Flames, Razor Gauntlets, and a Naglering. 
---
If you are already killing Ragnaros, try to get the trinket that reflects damage in hit.
---
If you are an engineer, save up for a force reactive disk.
---
Boom, AoE threat solved.
---
Fake!!!!
---
FYI I heard vacuuming can cause static and damage components... don’t know how true it is, but might be worth looking into.
---
Wasn't pally at one point pigeon holed into exclusively tossing rebuffs all raid night?
---
They really only have phase release dates and any changes to the way things get released. We already know the content involved through completion.
---
You can link them to a battle.net friend, and then use that link into chat.
---
Dal tends is probably a little better than deeps woods/ Mira's. But harder to get due to all the competition. 
---
Regardless, your damage will be gimped by a lot if you don't buy edgemasters handguards. If youre not an orc/human you need to buy edgemasters handguards. Non negotiable.

I chose to roll on the server my friends told me to roll on because I never played WoW before and wanted to play with them. I'm also not saying Phase 2 is going to be full of corpse camping, that's just what I've seen other people say and most of the responses are "Fuck you casual" with very few people giving helpful advice about how you can still level and play the game. A few people have given good explanations on how you can avoid problems in Phase 2 so I'm not really that concerned about it at this point. My comment was just pointing out how hostile people are being to lower-rank players and their concerns. At the time when I wrote this I was just genuinely trying to understand how Phase 2 will affect me at level 41, and from a lot of the comments I read even before I started participating in the threads, I got the impression that the community hates people like me and doesn't want us in the game to begin with.
---
When I first joined this sub it was full of people who were happy to give good and useful advice to newer and inexperienced players, and that is not at all what I was seeing yesterday.
---
He would still be alive if he never quit WoW. It’s a damn shame.
---
That’s great. I’d click it farming all the time. If you can do it, great. I know I can’t.
---
You obviously never even tested VuhDo in classic.
---
Hm, i guess so. But I mainly do see this a lot whenever people ONLY need a tank or healer left. They will type out something like "LF1M healer for BRD. Instead of jist LF heals BRD g2g
---
Frost Mages just press Blizzard, even in Single Target situations. :)
---
I would rather never play wow again than play it in my native language. Good god
---
Are you trying to hurt my feelings? lol
---
sad how blizzard sitll havent ban this guy...
---
very shameful fking blizzard FREE HK
---
good job.
---
I joined a group once that was lf2m heals and tank
---
Joined as druid tank and the other 3 were legit dps war dps war ret pali
---
What the actual fuck guys....
---
Pre-bis should be fine. On private server most of my guild was in pre-bis and we cleared it all. Classic BWL should be a lot easier.
---
Actually, Warlord's Blessing is for turning in the head of Rend. The Ony buff is called Rallying Cry of the Dragon Slayer.
---
The 15 years thing is not relevant, in fact todays technology with machine learning and AI makes it possible to create more "natural looking/acting" bots therefore making it harder to detect. It's kinda like saying that computer related hacking stuff is happening since like 20-30 years, they could have come up with a solutions since that long... (obviously in this video the bot seems to be quite simple but you probably see my point)
---
Whether by incident or intention I can get amusement out of warlock demon names. One of the most recent ones to get a chuckle was a voidwalker by the name of Phannos.
---
Dirty rotten clicker
---
you lost me and probably most of this website when you got to "gf"
---
" not very serious about the game and will quit soon, or already did quit "  
---
LOL. People can be serious about playing the game and still have a job and a life, not being 60 doesn't mean you are going to quit, that's about the dumbest thing posted on this sub and that's saying something. Just because the adults playing this game can't keep up with the no lifer basement dwellers and kids playing doesn't mean they are quitting soon or not taking it seriously.
---
Apply sunder armor, press tab to switch target, apply sunder armor. Rinse and repeat.
---
horrigan has played retail since classic on venture co
---
this is not his first time being offensive for the sake of being offensive
---
Welcome to the club, fellow bow bro! Felt like beating Dark Souls when I did it. Any other class would be lucky to have such a questline that showcases their kit so well.
---
You can click health pots... The only real requirement is that you use it when you'll get full benefit and you probably should not use it when you *need it most* because you could just get burned down instantly anyway when that low.
---
Given that reddit things everyone makes enough for weekly respecs, don't gimp yourself and just swap to shadow when the raid is done.
---
Which trinkets help for mining
---
strange, because I'm having plenty of fun :)
---
so blizzard will never be able to write good stories? that's defeatist
---
No, they will not do that, because they want to direct populations away from high-pop servers.
---
No, this isn't possible.
---
Thought so - they are unchallenged
---
I click mine too, I don't like having consumables mapped in case I hit the wrong bind
---
Tbh , I watched these Vids so many times. Music , Sounds are so spot on, it's hilarious. Enjoy them a lot.
---
modern raiding shits all over old wow and it's not close, even normal (not lfr) is harder than most raids in classic for example
---
Typical retail player folks^^^^^
---
Lol have my babies
---
undead male is the sexiest character in world of warcraft anyway
---
"ok boomer" can also be directed at non-boomers, to disparagingly imply they are acting like a boomer
---
yeah that's fine, it's just not very good in pvp
---
Not very useful, you don’t need to stack FR as ranged even for Rag. Guilds just heal through the damage.
---
^ typical person on the classic sub bashing retail. You are a real unicorn
---
I guess we would disagree on what world pvp is. My first experience was a 60 rogue gankfucking my level 23 warlock questing. Is that world pvp?
---
I think the Protection branch is my favorite.
---
I'm saying you are a high pop server and transfer to a low population server... then like send a ticket to transfer back right away. Will they do that?
---
That's not underground it's pretty apparent and it's only enabled by the fact that most American law is itself racist as fuck. There is no underground racism, just shit that's brushed aside by people who don't understand what racism is because they don't experience it.
---
You are such a centrist in this it's fucking sad.
---
You do not sit down with people who are actively wanting to hurt, deport and kill you. They don't give two fucks and any amount of discourse that has stemmed from that mentality.
---
The only real solution for most white supremacists is a fucking bullet to the head and preventing them from spreading their hate to anyone else. 
---
But this tweet -did- get the dude banned which prevents people from having to actively deal with his racist shit in game. That's not fucking lip service and it's ending a source of hate that's directed towards thousands of fucking players.
---
You don’t need any fire resistance.
---
U need better guildies
---
It’s not really a dps check. If you struggle with him just go get world buffs and it’s a one shot.
---
Server?
---
https://wowlevelspeedcalculator.com/
---
I dont see it. At 20hrs per week, which is already is already high for a casual player, you are looking at end of november.
---
I hope resto shamans are not like that bc from my experience I just try to fill the healing roll and throw down wind fury first. Maybe I’m just not an idiot. Lmao
---
So much this. They could also fill in the holes in the maps that they never bothered to finish.
---
Except a 60 rogue ganking a 23 warlock doesn’t give any honor. That was also a part of vanilla and it has happened to me on my alt as well. No changes right? Go cry somewhere else
---
I can find like 3 mean comments and 100 people moaning about the salt :/ Relax guys
---
Op well done this is cool stuff :)
---
I've seen it happen a couple times.  They said they would charge me and I said to find another healer.  Then they were like LOL JK XD.
---
The more likely scenario is that you ask then for water and they ignore you.  Then when you press the issue, they go "LOL wasn't reading chat, I'm watching Netflix."
---
Yeah, I'm so glad that, as a caster, I don't have to do any ubrs besides for reed, my 2nd character is approaching 60 and that'll be the easiest part of the bis grind besides boe/quest items
---
Please point out where I said "single zone"
---
What if i told you that in Dota2 the epitome of esport, the team who won 15M USD this year and last year don't follow cookie cutter draft and play for fun?
---
Starcraft 1 didn't change for 10 years yet people are still developing new way to win and counter each other. 
---
It's because of casuals that cookie cutter is a thing, so that casuals can just follow one direction and "kick ass". Without cookie cutter, casuals complain about how the game is too complex or doesn't "respect" player time.
---
I remember there being an addon that basically made a list of people with missing health, you could click it to target. You could basically just stare at one spot, and all you need is there. Click on top of the list and heal that.
---
And you’re the typical person to get offended when people in the classic wow sub shit on retail and accuse me of trying to hurt your feelings. Poor guy
