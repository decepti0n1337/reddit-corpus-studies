[wolfshead](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=8345/wolfshead-helm#comments) shouldn’t stack with furor so....

---
---
Just try not to use it in Ratchet.
---
Back when trolling took some creativity, lol. Good stuff.
---
I’d follow the Druidic teachings to live the life of a bear as well as an elf.
---
mage, warlock, hunter obv
---
That kind of plays with the lore though anyways right? Horde only arrived so few years ago while all other races have been developed for a quite a while. The more I learn about this game the more I appreciate the asymmetrical design
---
Man's best friend.
---
it all reads in the tooltip so there is no procrate or any hidden value pservers had to guess
---
You'll never get past rank 10 with that kind of play time. 
---

---
As for my schedule, i expect to have almost no social life until i reach 60(probably a month or so), then just play my 2 raid/week and some pvp when i can.
---
Yea they can. If you hover over the link what URL does it point to?
---
I don’t understand why this is an issue. It could easily be solved by each individual streamer stating that they are going pick their server on launch by some method (first PvP server alphabetically, first PvE server that starts with a H and continues alphabetically if necessary, etc.) then someone makes a post here the day before launch and contains all of that data. This way people can know that at least the big streamers on launch will not be on their server. Obviously new streamers can pop up over time but that seems a little more difficult to control.
---
Fixed 26th Feb 2019. Thanks for letting me know.
---
Fixed 26th Feb 2019. Thanks for the heads up!
---
Doesn’t mean it works with forms.
---
Well if you have played him for months then you would know that what hes saying is true, if perplexity himself have said that rogues become shit after aq patch and lose to a lot of classes 1v1
---
I added links to view raid sets T1-T3 in 3D in the latest patch today. Thanks for the suggestion.
---
Hey I had a look at this and you are correct - fixed incorrect values today 26th Feb 2019. Thanks for the feedback.
---
Fixed 26th Feb 2019. Thank you!
---
Fair enough
---
Fixed 26th Feb 2019. Cheers.
---
Hey, I updated the UD warlock section with your suggestion today. Thanks.
---
Yep you were right. Fixed 26th Feb 2019 :)
---
What is unlocked at level 35 to make it good for a bank alt?
---
And this dumbass mentality is why your druid has their entire tier set while you're still struggling to get your second, maybe third piece.
---
Fixed this today 26th Feb 2019. Thank you for pointing that out.
---
No it wasn't correct - fixed this today. Still a large margin but not THAT large :)
---
Fixed 26th Feb 2019. Cheers mate.
---
I made with my mage up to 5/15 Naxx on retail, and I have killed KT with my mage on a private server with 8/8 t3 and almost BiS gear (vanillagaming). 
---
It depends on how you define "end game". In MC, BWL and onyxia, mages are very bad at dps since they have to stay frost, and with frost you are at a disadvantage against warlocks, even if you have pre-AQ BiS gear. Yes there are some fights that are interesting and fun, but in general you are just a water vending machine.
---
ZG is fun as it involves a lot of AoE.
---
Things are getting very interesting in AQ and eventually in Naxx, where you **have** to spec fire and coordinate with other mages on the ignites, but watch the threat meter at the same time from the insane amounts of dps.  Loatheb and Patchwerk are such examples. Personally I ended up #3 in dps in our KT kill, was only beaten by a warrior and a rogue.
---
So yes, I think AQ40-Naxx are the most rewarding for mages if you make it there. Other caster classes will eat your dust and you will still complete with warriors and rogues in terms of dps. You still won't be able to one-shot people with a fire blast though.
---
Hey u/wsc981 I updated the tool today and changed regen description for classes affected and also changed the bit about Shadowmeld - totally makes sense! Thanks for your help.
---
level 300 professions, i.e. another character to do stuff like transmutes or build alternative engineering stuff (globlin vs gnomish)
---
Hey I removed this from the tool today in an update - you are totally right lol. Thanks.
---
Cheers, I fixed both of these issues today. &lt;3
---
Fixed 26th Feb 2019. Thanks for informing me.
---
Delivery was really funny, loved the extra lore bits like the Caverns of Time portion.
---
One of the biggest mindfucks for me in vanilla was opening the hidden chamber behind whitemane to see a literal undead controlling shit, and I was disappointed that didn't make it in. But otherwise really enjoyable
---
Nope it was wrong values input by me :) Fixed today in a patch.
---
Cheers budd. Now gonna visit it :)
---
Ah cool, I guess that will mostly be useful a few months into Classic, but something good to consider anyway. Can't wait for release!
---
Hey /u/Blaxmith just to let you know  I changed the Spirit values for pallies today after finding a most commonly agreed formula for them.
---
The balance is pretty broken all around. You can get t2/2.5 and still global someone in t3. It just might take a bit more luck. 
---
Popping consumables at the right time is the best way to prevent insta deaths, but it’s still going to happen every now and then. I like the quick pvp encounters compared to the more moba style pvp in retail. 
---
Thanks for the detailed reply and insight into the PVE aspect of things. I should have mentioned in my post but I was really asking how they are in end game PvP when you have top tier gear. Do you have any experience regarding that? 
---
not long, but that moonkin... 
---
where is that "irl" might be ?
---
same bug persist bro. both human and gnome have identical intellect. Should that be the case?
---
Plan is to play around my work and kids schedules. Myself and the wife figure 8-11 at night should be a pretty easy time slot. Rainy or just nasty weekends hopefully get a few random hours in during the day
---
 3 hours a day is enough for a casual, at 60 after getting your preraid bis you mostly just raidlog during the weekends and monday thru friday you just do battlegrounds. You should be able to get rank 8 like that which is 4 pieces of the blue pvp set.
---
Oh shit, I must have just changed the stats at level 1 and not at 60. No it's not the case the 60 stats should be different too. Will change, sorry man!
---
Its ok I accept donations for my work :D
---
I had a friend that would camp outside IF and invite fresh noobs to his group to "continue" their adventure.  Poor guys were ported to Darnassus.  Other variations included summons to the arena in STV.
---
JWT you have my respect and admiration. It's all I can afford atm :) Will let you know when this is finally sorted.
---
And once you do that you'll probably get a ban if Blizzard think you're doing it on purpose which.. you are. At least that what i'm assuming will happen in the beginning. 
---
Another good one:

I didnt realise I wanted a maladath spear until now
---
Very cool strategy. Also nice Berserk music.
---
Ye I just finished watching it then played wow doing this.. there was no other choice of song..
---
Submit a ticket asking about the account username, say it wasnt merged into a battle.net account. They're pretty good at that sort of thing! They might have you make a battle.net account then they'll put the WoW onto it.
---
Careful, there is an absolutely massive spider hiding somewhere here...
---
I love that this joke wasn't relevant in 2006.
---
First time watching? I highly recommend the manga, it is beautifully illustrated and some of the story arcs are just as compelling as the golden age arc of the anime. Also there's a cool new fan-made motion comic adaptation with insane production quality that recently released its first episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5lLQza7Mew
---
ok ^^
---
Thank you! Yeah looking back i really should've included the undead guy (Inquisitor Fairbanks). I just remember back in the day most of the people treated him as an afterthought, probably because he didn't drop much.
---
But lore wise he was a real factor in the formation of the Scarlet Crusades rival (Argent Dawn). My bad on that omission. 
---
The better it looks, the worse it is. All gamers know this.
---
Haha just started to read the manga, it's unreal! got a nice link to it too [readberserk.com](https://readberserk.com) so I don't need any third party apps.. think i'll read it first before watching the rerelease though ;)

Go one further - auto setup of your action bars afterwards

Some very authentic 2004-inspired gameplay!

U N I Q U E
---
Main reason for posting though was  because I see so many prot paladins using Conc which means downtime.. I wanted to show that holy shield was and still is awesome :)
---
24 left until ~~my death~~ I leave Azeroth, so I'm gonna waste a lot of lives, but I'll cherish every breath, I know exactly where I'm goin, But I'ma send you there first, and with the HK's I'll be gettin I'ma send you there worse, I've been livin with a scarlet curse, and now it's all about to end, but before I go say hello to my little ^(cheapshot) friend
---
Pick up Dreadmist to complete the ruse. Used to do this all the time. Had the little mini diablo as a pet that people thought was a Warlock pet. Ah... memories.

**\[Malicious Intent\]\[NA\]\[PVP\]\[H\]**
---
&lt;Malicious Intent&gt; is a Semi-Hardcore Horde raiding guild that will be competitively pushing all high end content in classic WoW with a focus on both clearing content and having fun doing it. We will initially be raiding **two days a week with a possible third night for progression weeks (never on the weekend)**. We use a loot council system with static members and one member rotated in per week to keep the council a fair and diverse place. &lt;Malicious Intent&gt; will be focusing on 40-man content. We will have PvP and PvE events; these include - but are not limited to - farming Devilsaur, raid consumables, gearing under-geared guildies and possibly even city raids. We are mostly working adults which may cause us to clear at a slower pace, but our guild is competitive and progression focused - so we will clear content. While we are a raiding guild we also welcome social players to build and take part in our community.
---
**Experience:**
---
* Leadership has experience into and through AQ40.
---
* We will gladly accept raiders both with and lacking prior experience. All we ask is that you put in equal effort in learning fights and coming prepared.
---
**Recruitment:**
---
* We are currently seeking all roles, but as more people reach 60 we will close or open certain classes/specs.
---
* We do allow obscure specs, however the positions are ***highly competitive*** and they may receive lower loot priority than traditional specs.
---
**Schedule:**
---
Tuesday,Wednesday,

I can see where you are coming from but for me I would like the war in WARcraft to be capital letters lol. That being said I think it would be pretty cool if they offered a super high pop and a proper sized option as well. Not sure why they couldn't do that but I am also not a programmer so that means nothing lol.
---
WotF is a pretty good utility for a raid tank to have, I would say undead for PvE warrior over tauren. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
(and I say this having played a mainly PvE tauren warrior).
---
I was not playing PvP much, but in general many pieces you get from Naxx are not useful in PvP. If you are a PvPer you don't want to invest your time on Naxx raids (which doesn't include the raid themselves, but insane grinding and farming for consumables, boss wipes, AQ-BWL gearing etc etc) just to ***hope*** to get your hands on some gear that might be useful for PvP. To put it another way, if you are a serious Naxx raider (= hardcore mode) then you won't have time for serious PvP, unless you share your account with someone else.
---
NA sorry thought i put that in there its updated for future weeks now :)
---
Sounds like the group of guys and gals over at &lt;Working Adults&gt; might suit your 9-5 WoW dilemma.
---
Check us out on reddit at r/workingadultsguild

Holy shit what a rollercoaster. I can't believe you two retards argued for that long. 
---
BTW DarkPhenomenon was right this whole time and Aodhyn kept missing the point.
---
Ashkandi isnt that easy to get :D 
---
3 Monitors master  race - doing mindless SEO while grinding mindlessly
---
This map was out when/before the game was released, and Maraudon wasn't released until a later (but very early) patch, just like Dire Maul. Note how although Dire Maul and Ahn'Qiraj have the text, but no markers for dungeons like the other dungeons that list the level ranges. Also, certain flight paths aren't in here like Un'Goro or Silithus because they weren't out at launch.
---
My man.
---
Would definitely check out the troll women in Sen'jin Village after. They are fine.
---
It's a drop rate so it depend on your luck, i read from different source it's between 25% to 40% drop rate. So not that rare but still , you can go do X run and get nothing.
---
Plus the mob is pretty far in the instance, you obviously go there in stealth so it take times.
---
Iam actually finishing my master thesis in the summer time so if Iam not getting a job immidieatly ill be playing fulltime. I even plan to stream it - who knows, in the end id be making a living off WoW haha
---
Obviously you wanted to be as efficient as possible. All spells must do damage no matter what. That's how you become the best!
---
It demands more investement to get the right gear, and even then you will just be decent, never top.
---
So when i read about people grinding for hours in wow, do they mean they are on grindr?
---
My Shaman was pretty awesome at KBs. Guaranteed crit chain lightning (every 3 minutes if I remember correct) and frost shocks kills a-plenty. Loved AV for those epic long battles and high KB numbers.
---
**Running from Gordo, the friendly abomination Horde NPC Questgiver.**
---
To be fair, the game I had played prior was Resident Evil Nemesis.
---
**&lt;Undaunted&gt; - Horde |NA-PVP| semi-hardcore**
---
Undaunted is recruiting members prior to the release of classic wow. Welcoming all players that are experienced or new with determination to progress at a steady rate and dedication on making the guild a better experience overall. We want to have a strong core of members when the game launches.
---
This guild will be semi-hardcore, Horde, and with a laid back demeanor but still seeking to progress with a goal to leave no one behind for those that show up on raid times, etc. Ideally a strong core roster of experienced players would be preferred to help out around the guild and bring everyone up to speed. We want a good sense of community within this guild so don’t be afraid to speak up and talk to others, in the end remember to just have fun with the game as well.
---
We will be doing PVE and PVP content with raids times being listed below but we do enjoy world pvp when we get the chance, perhaps even forming BG groups later on when they get introduced. When raiding starts we will be doing 3 nights a week. We are currently recruiting all classes, just play what you feel like. 
---
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday - 7:30 - 10:30 est
---
We currently have a discord channel. We have tabs for class/dungeon guide talk to help people out not familiar with classic wow and you can usually find me in general voice chat. Feel free to add me on discord or bnet for more info on joining it.
---
Bnet: Feral#11785 Discord: Feral#0846
---
Its not a raid if you're not terrified of the gm. 
---
Thanks for the thoroughness, kikd developer!
---
I personally believe the Eversong Woods and Silvermoon are the most aesthetically pleasing areas in the game.  I mean, besides the fact that the top of Silvermoon is missing :)
---
Going by the people that frequent this place, no thanks.
---
&gt; level 60 requirement
---
So twink community is possibly not represented? What about levelers? 
---
For hord pvp : take Orc if you can, then undead if you can, then anything at this point because it's pretty much shit(sorry taurens, i still love you).
---
True but initially there was no transferring off a server unless it was to a lower pop server. Once they added paid server transfers migrations weren’t as common.
---
When whispering cross realm names come up as jataai-frostmane, so charactername-servername.
---
Except the strategy against hunter is to LoS them, they cant close to melee or youll easily kill them, when they send their pet in, you just kill it and it doesnt hit that hard against plate. Their only choice is to sit there and wait or back off.
---
The way you lose is if you try and chase them once theyre out of range.
---
Well you won't be competitive in PvP, better accept it from the start.
---
using the workshop key going in the back way its literally the first boss you can encounter within a minute.
---
This is awesome. If it isn't a thing already, it should be a thing to find real life versions of wow geography
---
Regrowth is terrible Maan efficiency and rejuvenate just isn't used in PvP in general. Healing touch mostly
---
Yikes indeed. I'd argue someone who'd cater their game experience towards griefing a streamer is worse than the streamer fanboys. 
---
I was trying to downrank regrowth/rejuv to work with it better.
---
So they stand their and do 3 sec healing touches or a weak 2.5 sec heal at rank 4/2 sec heal at rank 3?
---
This is upsetting because druid was so cool in BC :{
---
"aoe"
---
Does rejuvenate and regrowth ever become mana efficient through down ranking and high spell power?
---
If youre a guy, cringing is what you do when you see someone else get kicked in the nuts, and feel it yourself.
---
Tbh doesn’t seem so lmfao 
---
Oh ok, noted.
---
&gt;  Alright so a lot of us who played vanilla are now old and work 9-5 jobs. 
---
I had a 9-5 job back in 2004, 2005, 2006.
---
My WoW schedule was basically that I would get home from work around 5.30ish, get in the login queue, make a quick dinner, and then play WoW until roughly 2am. Wake up approx 8am, go to work. Rinse and repeat. 
---
Weekends I typically played about 25-30 hours over the two days. 
---
WoW is somewhat compatible with work, but not with a family. 
---
I work 9-6 below is my rough plan for the first 6 months or so.
---
* Home by 6:20
---
* Figure I can start gaming by 6:30
---
* Level for 2 hours
---
* Quick dinner at 8:30
---
* Back leveling by 9 pm
---
* Level for 3-4 more hours
---
* Hit level 60 in roughly 2 months IRL
---
Now my plan changes a bit
---
* Same plan for time played
---
* First 2 hours will be leveling an alt, not sure what class, but something
---
* Following 3 hour block will be to do quests, dungeons, and professions on my Druid main
---
I figure within 6 months IRL I can have 1 PreBis Druid, and a freshly dinged 60 alt. I doubt I will level another toon to 60 for some time at this point. And I also won't be so hardcore about the time.
---
Umm learn to down rank spells and not go all out with Regrowth?
---
Intelligent design decisions
---
Input from reddit hive mind
---
Pick one (or none, really)
---
mind if I have it next? 
---
Add Feralas to that list. Probably my favorite zone. 
---
&gt;How do you guys plan to balance playing time with your job?
---
Work from home. Literally play while working.
---
Almost the same for me but much earlier in about 1988.
---
I had just got an amiga 500 and i bought my first game for it called Dungeon Master. I was playing it about 2am in the morning, lights out and wearing headphones. Wandering through the dungeon i saw a small worm coming towards me, nothing much to worry about for my intrepid hero i thought. Then suddenly the worm lunged towards me and its mouth opened up and filled the screen. The was this sudden scream in my headphones which was so unexpected that i screamed as well, lol.
---
I was laughing so hard that i died but from then on i was hooked on computer games and i wanted to know how to do something so cool as that worm.
---
At around the same time one of the computer magazines for the Amiga had some graphics articles and a free copy of Devpac assembler on a cover disc, that's a floppy disc cover disc for you youngsters. :)
---
I never actually ever made my own game, i found i preferred programming system tools and utilities. Ended up going back to college at the age of 40 to do software engineering.
---
But i never lost my love for playing computer games and here i am at 67 as eager to play wow classic as i was to battle fierce worms on my amiga.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5zsDGafjGo&amp;t
---
lol tell me they aren't useless ? I'm waiting 
---
Every server is going to be the "wrong" server. The grass is always greener on the other side. Pick a server, have fun and don't think too much about what could have been.
---
My kind of video. 43 seconds, straight to the point. No dude talking for 5 minutes explaining how he stumbled upon it for the first time. Just here it is, goodbye.
---
&gt; Who cares though?
---
Exactly. Some neckbeards /following some other neckbeard around a zone couldn't be of less interest to me. But those server will have high pops, and not necessarily only due to the streamers. They will attract a lot more people by being high pop in the first place.
---
Same thing happened with the really popular servers at vanilla launch that were chosen to be the "It" servers by communities like SA. To this day those servers are still high pop. Long after the "celebrities" are gone.

---
Not even free shipping
---
Take it easy, Rick Harrison
---
Definitely. What I'm looking for in a server that will hopefully stay alive:
---
1. West Coast
---
2. PvP
---
3. No streamers
---
4. Server is named after an old god or important figure since it seems pvpers gravitate towards servers with those type of names.
---
Resto druid + pvp = awful combo
---
E-girls love em
---
I am afraid too. Don't wanna play on dead server after 1 year ((
---
Hell just making a portal at the entrance to AV before gates would be raised sometimes resulted in a 3rd of the raid leaving, twas good times.
---
The problem with Druid in PvP is that they have so many tools that you can burn mana in an instant. Cast a big regrowth, drop a rejuv or two, shift once or twice and boom, you’re just dying for mana.
---
The biggest trick in Druid PvP is damage mitigation to avoid blowing all your mana. It’s difficult given Druid’s lack of CC, so judicious use of cooldowns and CC can help, as well as status curing can be really useful, but past that there’s not much you can do other than try to predict which down ranks can prevent your buddies from becoming shiny corpses.
---
I was curious as to who started playing later on and is coming to try out Classic, and who played during Classic and is coming back for more. Thank you in advance!
---
\-Present
---
That's just the nature of PvP healing in vanilla really (besides Pally). Just keep on Rejuv on anybody who needs it, insect swarm and root melees to reduce incoming damage, and get off a Regrowth or two if you can. Then you either drink or die and rez with full mana. 
---
Hello fellow Healthcare worker! I feel your pain. I figure my best bet for raiding is joining a EU/Aus guild with mid-week raids as an alternate. That way I could play all day with then on weekdays I happen to have off, and be available for the wife in the evening and weekends. How bout you? 
---
You’re focusing only on the chat aspect of why OP thinks the people make the Barrens great. 
---
There’s also the in-world aspect. The barrens, a massive zone where all Horde races come together for the first time. Each time you come back to camp stronger, and because the barrens is such a grind, you look at the level 17+ characters and want to become one, because they have shoulder pads and are organizing WC runs. 
---
The Barrens are a rite of passage each Horde player goes through and remembers vividly. It’s iconic
---
Thanks will do! 
---
You're saying a premade full of rogues and a dedicated FC can still be effective?
---
Well color me surprised
---
Orc warlock is better than ud due to hardiness and fury for pvp, or +pet dmg and fury for pve 
---
I think, if I can for a second collectively respond for the community - just make whatever you want. These “help me decide” posts show up every day and the response is always the same - play what is fun for you. 
---
That said, from what you listed in your desires go hunter. Or don’t if you want to be a rogue. Just have fun. Make both and level what you’re “feeling” more.
---
I was going to select classic until I realized I've never played classic.
---
Not even /r/humblebrag, just brag
---
Stop harassam people
---
Never understood that. It's so much stress, unless you're that careless about others that you just go AFK without that worry in the back of your mind that people are waiting on you. If you have the privilege of playing at work, just grind at work and do the dungeons when you can relax at home and play uninterrupted. Roll a stealth class, too.
---
Nothin like the ol' VAG
---
Level one blizzard spam. Grats one mage just owned your entire BG of rogues because it cost no mana slows you and can proc roots. 10 frost mages can own a WSG and it was done constantly in old WoW for the lol's and because of how shatter works. 10 rogues? No lol. 
---
I could settle with Dead Dogs...
---
I’m in the same boat. The hardest part about this game is the character selection screen. 
---
I’ve leveled 2 hunters on pservers to level 45ish. And approximately 30 alts into the teens. 
---
Every time I log back onto the toon I “swear” is the one I just can’t seem to get back into the groove and lose interest. I can’t help but feel like my time would be better leveling something “better”. 
---
Population density will affect overall pricing, and price changes will behave differently in regional servers.  
---
Private servers have two main "prime times", with 10 AM CST being the biggest one. Which means price fluctuation has a lot less time to ebb and flow than it does on a regional server.  
---
On a regional server, you'll have a larger cooldown period, and could see greater price drops in the off hours and off days of the economic week.  
---
If this was done on a private server this would have been condemned toxic af. But since it's vanilla it's cool af. The double standard lol 
---
I think you should reconsider undead warlock. Yes it may feel repetitive to level another one, but you should play what you enjoy the most. Also, you could level him differently. Maybe if you leveled affliction you can try demonology or destruction. I think that is the fun of warlock. There are lots of different options. 
---
I think druids are very underrated in Classic, why not try one? It will also give you invisibility like a Rogue, and a sick multidimensional play style.
---
&gt;One of my biggest weaknesses in life is how ridiculously indecisive I can be. I keep endlessly pondering about these three particular classes to main in Classic.
---
Here's an opportunity to change that. Don't think of the choice as right and wrong. It's like Chocolate or Vanilla. Both are good. Sometimes one sounds better than the other. Neither is bad. 
---
&gt;My main priorities are these as follow: 1. Playstyle 2. WPvP power 3. Class fantasy 4. Leveling &amp; Raiding 5. Gearing
---
&gt;On one hand, there's the Rogue
---
Once every 5 to 10 minutes you are a 1v1 god in WPvp. You'll do really nasty cool shit with cold blood prep, gouge &gt; blind &gt; stealth &gt; reopen &gt; vanish &gt; reopen. In PvE the rotation is meh, but so is literally every other class. You're second to none in WPvP. Rogues don't win every matchup all the time. But rogues get to pick when they engage or don't. With an expansive toolkit and a high skill ceiling you won't be the one getting camped. Class fantasy is a huge part of every class in WoW. You'll find it everywhere, but rogues do a good job with stealth, sap, pickpocket, and the subterfuge feel of being able to hide in plain sight. 
---
&gt;On the other, there's the Hunter
---
Can't speak to the playstyle of a hunter. They kite a lot. They are very strong in WPvP having the largest range attacks in the game. They can be outplayed by a skilled player if they know how to sit your dead zone. Class fantasy is great. Most people bond with their pets since they are such an investment. 
---
&gt;jack of all trades, master of nothing: the Druid
---
This is your main.

Playstyle? Which playstyle? Feral? The offtank extraordinaire? Feral offtanks are so underrated. Yeah they can get crit, so what. They bring so much more to the table in DPS when they aren't actively tanking over a prot warrior with a 2h that it's worth the extra attention from a healer. Resto? Resto is like any other healer. If healing is your thing, druids can be really fun with down ranked heals and basically never running out of mana. If healing isn't your thing, stay feral. 
---
WPvP Power? Undisputedly the slipperiest sons of bitches in the video game when it comes down to world pvp. If you die, it's probably somehow your fault. It probably could have been prevented. Because druids in WPvP can just run the fuck away when the going gets rough. They are tough as shit to kill and will wear you down through attrition or with big dick kitty crits. 
---
Class Fantasy? You're a fucking cat/bear/seal/cow|elf in the same character. I don't know what more class fantasy you need. 
---
When I die I don’t want to go to heaven, it’s probably full of boring religious people. Instead, I want to go to an RL version of Azeroth.
---
You'll probably make more by selling them in Darkshire instead of the AH. People would pay more to not have to go back to SW and you also skip the AH cut. At least that's how it was for Frost Oil in Badlands because going back to Org from Badlands was a huge mission for Horde.
---
Yeah poll should say Vanilla not Classic. 
---
Ah, a man of refined taste 
---
They are not useless.
---
I knew there'd be petty people coming in and saying "IT WAS VANILLA NOT CLASSIC HRUHURHURHURHUR"
---
By the time most people are in Darkshire, I'll be in Tanaris, I'll have my 2nd acct camped in IF for the kingpin action.
---
[Current plans](https://i.imgur.com/RjzIxxf.png)  
---
This is what your life looks like when you don't have shit else going on besides work.  
---
As an alliance player tauren and undead zones are great. Orc troll zone little boring but so is dwarf zone imo.
---
So is your plan to kingpin the AH on one screen during dungeon/respawn/for/autorun downtime on the other screen?
---
It's funny how the people calling others mentally ill for no reason, are often mentally ill themselves.  
---
Week old reddit account as well? No wonder with that attitude.  
---
Maybe it's time to reflect on the number of banned accounts you have in this subreddit and seek help. 
---
I'll have 100-120 hours on my main to 60, if I've got 10 seconds between point A and point B, I can look to the side and refresh an AH search.
---
Plus main will have extra gold to supply to my side chick for more kingpinning.
---
I will try to help you, but I want to know how many hours per week you will be spending playing Classic WoW.  
---
Count each day, add them all up, give me the number.  
---
So it's not a legit item?
---
That's awesome. I played a Prot Paladin in TBC and I had a lot of fun. My favorite memory was accidentally pulling an entire room in Kara. I just used consecrate and tanked them all. Fortunately I had sick heals because we survived. It was amazing. Their survivability is wicked with bubble, being able to stun and Holy Light, and also lay on hands during worst case scenario. It was like you had 3 lives. :)
---
You got a cool name lined up for your AH alt?
---
Bring up this comment :-)
---
Technically Horde are the better PvE faction if we're talking best of the best players. Shaman totems are just too damn good.
---
Alliance pre-made PvP (eg WSG) is better than Horde. Paladins are better in organised PvP.
---
Lame.
---
I picked it up in 2006 but didn't start consistently playing until Wrath launched.
---
The vast majority of players will not be private server players so the economy should look roughly similar. That being said, certain reagents and items will be more highly valued out of the gate due to their use in Naxx, AQ, the war effort, etc.
---
My current (and since OG Vanilla) bank alts are Bagspace and Morebagspace. But who knows.
---
I just wanted to show to people who would find it nice.
---
The guy lied about having a character on private servers, couldn't name them, lied about what guilds he was on and knows very little about the class he claimed to play. Literally everything he said comes from content creators that don't know much. That classifies as mentally ill. As far as reddit, I haven't use reddit for years because of people like him/her that are mentally ill. Only came on here because the official WoW forum is dead. It's just a few trolls (more mentally ill people) who propose changes to try to get reactions with moderation there doing a pretty poor job, if there is even moderation left since they fired so many CS people.
---
nice try but you're wrong. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6liA5LALZhg
---
I think LFR mentality hasn’t helped either. You can do a raid ark and it works out fine, why wouldn’t you be able to do the same in a 5 man? Yeah, it’s frustrating.
---
Due to your priorities the warlock seems to be the right class, followed by hunter, rogue, druid. I mained a warlock in classic and destroyed most classes and don't remember any one class being a major threat other than if the player was actually good. They weren't over or under played but I think they are going to be way more popular this time around. 
---
That sounds like so much fun
---
no thats stupid paying more isnt gonna magically make WoW an untouchable nostalgia machine. 
---
People in the EU love warlocks more than the US?  That's super interesting. Why is that?
---
Are there any other classes that would be more popular based on geography or culture?
---
I know it's not for everyone, but I'm excited for super long AV battles myself.
---
&gt; End-game rogue is one of the top DPS and one of the best PvP classes. I have played a full T3 rogue with BiS gear and MSA/Thunderfury, you kill anything in one stunlock. The only issues you will face, implying that you are using engineering like anyone who gives a damn about pvp, are geared soullink warlocks and skilled mages with tidal/skull/helmet. I would say it is the best 1v1 class along with mages and shadow priests. Even in BGs where people usually say that rogues suck, you can be a nightmare if played correctly (vanish cs drop flag repick, blind/helmet, with those tricks you can escape up to 4 enemies trying to get the wsg flag from you). I recommend checking out "perplexity vanilla rogue" and "roope vanilla rogue" on youtube to see a rogue at full potential. I have played years of vanilla and in my opinion rogues and mages are the classes which never get boring due to their skillcap and skillshots.
---
&gt; What a crock. LOL at a hunter losing to a rogue in vanilla, especially if dwarf or orc or a ret paladin that can literally kill them in one reck bomb when their (rogues) pvp trinket can't break a stun... 
---
See what I'm getting at?
---
Furthermore, he didn't lie, per se. He prolly played on that trash insta 60 server. You didn't even bother asking him though, did you?  
---
I agree with one thing though. The Official WoW Classic forums are a cesspool. By the looks of it however, you belong there. 
---
And then you start ganking low levels..
---
Yeah that is why I just blocked the guy. Obvious liars are obvious. The other account defending "him" is probably his to. This is humanity in 2019. They aren't worth arguing with. Just laugh at them.
---
I've done a couple runs with group compositions like this (with me as the Enhancement shaman) and it's so fun. You just fuckdozer over everything.
---
How will you deal with the body dysmorphia of having those giant forearms, though?
---
He did lie. He didn't play with and raid with Perplexity, he is wrong in several areas and he doesn't even know how progression changes pvp balance and claimed rogues were at their best when they are at their weakest PER THE GUY HE CLAIMED TO PLAY WITH. Why? Because Perplexity actually knows what he's talking about lol. Is this you on another account btw? My god reddit is a dumpster fire.
---
Hi! We have a group of 5 that fit this description to a T, and I love the raiding schedule of Sunday/Thursday.  
---
Do you guys plan on DKP or something similar? 
---
I work Sales, so there is times I'll be working from home, or I'll be driving all day between Baltimore and DC (absolutely atrocious traffic). I don't know what exactly I'm going to do. Gonna have to figure that out as I go. Somedays I could get 5-6 hours in, others.. none

Reading comprehension skill went from 1 to 2.

Eminence is now recruiting for our hardcore Classic Raiding guild! Here at Eminence we are all about preparation and organization to meet our classic wow goals! If you’re like us the hype levels are in overdrive and you’re busying yourself daily with everything possible to make sure you’re ready for classic already… so why not lock down a raid spot in a great community and progression-oriented guild too?
---
A little bit about Eminence? The guild is run by a smaller group Friends who have grown up gaming together along with a couple friends we’ve made along the way. All of us have high level experience across multiple games in addition to WoW, holding top percentile ranks in LoL, Overwatch, Halo, PoE, and others.
---
Eminence’s Officer core is extensively experienced in ALL of classic Vanilla Warcraft, both leading and clearing ALL content from release up to Naxx, as well as high US ranked clears of many tiers of retail WoW between WotLK and Legion. Currently members are still regularly active on pservers. Our discord is always active with people playing misc games and getting to know each other better while we build up our roster for launch!
---
Eminence will be using a EPGP loot system that rewards all raiders fairly for their effort towards the team’s success. More info on exactly how our loot system works can be found on our Website Forums or you can contact Redrick through discord.
---
We are currently recruiting people who are looking to join a Hardcore Raiding Guild/Community and want to get on board early with us during our building phase going into classic! We are a guild who WILL be #1 on the realm we settle on once classic releases. We will be rolling on a PVP realm on the Horde side while aiming for a medium population server. We are looking for dedicated and prepared individuals or groups of people who share the same mindset towards WoW that we do.
---
What exactly are we talking about? Eminence is looking for focused, dedicated, and motivated individuals that have high raiding aspirations for classic and the knowledge and experience to join us on the path to achieving them. We take raiding seriously, including everything from consumables, pre-raid BiS, to min/maxing profs/builds/raid compositions, and everything in between.
---
Overall we are looking for people with DEDICATION and PASSION for classic wow and mastery of their class(es). Chances are if you’re in here reading and made it this far while on the hunt for your classic guild this early, you’re the type of person we’re looking for. A lack of high level experience isn’t a deal-breaker but it’s definitely an asset when applying. We are mainly looking for people with Hardcore Retail wow experience and/or people with Private Server Raiding Experience.
---
The goal is to build a tight-knit and reliable team of like-minded, committed individuals who want to put maximum effort forth clearing content on the cutting edge and establishing ourselves as a premiere raiding guild. If you are interested in applying or would like to learn more about us please visit  
---
eminenceclassic.enjin com
---
We are looking for dedicated Tanks especially, all people of skill should apply (through website or through us on discord). We are 30+ members strong!
---

If you want to be an uber godmode utility druid (including top feral dps) some of the best gear is from pvping, rank 13 and WSG/AB rep.  That's the time sink. A lot of the pieces are bis for the entire duration of classic, or close to it. Rank 13 gets you really insane gear that works with bear and cat dps. If you can get it early on, whooooweee.
---
Playing spoiler free isn't what we're referring to here. The experience that is gone is being able to interact with the community without everybody having access to tried and tested information. 
---
Streamers will be playing 12+ hour days grinding to 60, they will be far ahead of 99% of the population. It's very unlikely you will coincidentally end up running into them. 
---
I'd be okay if all the super OP pets were kept OP but only spawned once a week. Imagine the utter chaos of 50 hunters from both factions waiting for a single mob to spawn and hoping to tame it before someone else snagged it or spit killed it (can you tame a critter you haven't tagged?)
---
I would be utter, beautiful chaos. Even better if it spawned once a week but at a random day and time each week.
---
Big help man, thanks. 
---
HOW ARE THERE NO COMMENTS ABOUT WHY THE QUIVER IS THE FIRST BAG SLOT AFTER BACKPACK ! WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU (quivers are way comfier next to their buddy the key ring) 
---
By swines you mean swoops....I fuckin hate swoops
---
I always thought it'd be hilarious if UC was old construction from the human kingdom days. and all the public works guys are incredibly confused as to why they've been ordered to build giant vomiting skulls everywhere.
---
Thats fun for like the first 1-2 years, maybe 3. Then theres way more leveled people than levelling lowbies.
---
The problem is as a casual, it can take a long time to get preraid BiS unless you have people to carry you. 
---
Even doing BRD princess runs (no idea if it will work in classic) will take about 40mins per run. 
---
Strath UD is pretty fast, probably an hour or so. Strath live is trickier and may take longer. 
---
Anyway, all these timings is assuming everyone in the group knows what they are doing and not accidentally pulling more mobs/wiping and someone in the group having actual gear, not questing greens /mixed blues. This group is to FARM pre-bis gear, not having pre-bis gear. I say this because someone will probably chip in with "ohh we clear it in 30mins MAX" while having some gear from raids or pre-bis gear.
---
You definitely wont be able to clear lv50+ dungeons in 30mins on questing greens. 
---
I haven't played Alliance in ages since I want to play a shaman, but I absolutely miss the dwarf zones. Some of my favorite areas in the game.
---
Lie about what, exactly?  
---
I quoted his first post, then I quoted the first sentence of yours. How bad can your reading comprehension actually be?  
---
Instead of asking him to clarify his points/experience you started talking about Hunters and Rets, and then you went off based on a presumption? What? To pile on the list of non sequential garbage, what is this shit about having fun on that ret paladin? You literally make zero sense.
---
Take your medication and go back to the official classic forums you deranged child.
---
I love Feralas too. There's a lot of different forest type biomes in the game but it's my favorite. It never feels claustrophobic with those giant canopies.
---
What races would they have added? Goblins as a neutral race
---
*laughs in Oceanic*
---
Watched the whole thing, that was amazing!
---
Even if it was a bundle for the same price, all I'd want is a classic sub in order to send the devs a message.
---
On the subject of Horde architecture I'll say that it varies. I like Forsaken towns and outposts with their reclaimed and ramshackle buildings but I despise Undercity. It's easily my least favorite city in the game. Orc stuff I'm ambivalent about, it's ugly but it gets the point across. I love Troll and Tauren stuff though, they've got such a chill aesthetic. I love stumbling across some friendly totem poles in the middle of a hostile area, or a sleepy seaside Troll village.
---
I pretty much only like Dwarf stuff on the Alliance side, but it's damn good.
---
My educated guess would be Kara. As far as I know, some of it had been worked on during vanilla's lifespan.
---
I remember wanted to play on DAGGERSPINE back in the day because yowza what a name! Unfortunately my friend played on a different server so the choice was made for me.
---
I will always pine for thee, DAGGERSPINE
---
Err, WoW was always going to have an expansion model, as that was what MMOs were doing at the time (Everquest, DAOC). The only real question is what content was going to be for Vanilla versus expansion. 
---
why is the title of the thread when you started playing but the question on the poll is what expansions you played?
---
That was retarded 0/10 but I would watch again.
---
They weren't. They thought they would only need a few servers and 30 devs to upkeep. They didn't expect the game to explode like it did. It snowballed fast.
---
bigger hitbox for warriors is amazing though and troll priests have way better toolkit then undead. for everything else... yeah.

Naxx 2

There will probably be two at a minimum. They've always had them and I have no reason to suspect they'll change that now. I also doubt streamers would roll on a RP-PVP server, from what I hear WoW streamers are more into minmaxed PVP/PVE/race to 60 type stuff. Besides it usually takes an RP server awhile to coalesce its identity. I've also heard people say that streamers might avoid PVP servers in general since they'll be subjected to ruthless streamsniping and will just stick to PVE and do BGs. Who knows. I wouldn't worry.

How would having private server players on your server affect you? 
---
I don’t care about how pretty they try to make the zones. It’s all about how immersive they are, and nothing does that better than Tirisfal. Not even close. Also I love the savannah of the Barrens. Thousand Needles is not my favorite at all, but Ashenvale is great. Alliance zones are boring af but while you’re walking into them you say ‘that’s nice I guess”
---
No. HoTs and DoTs just have innately poor scaling in Vanilla. They get poor +damage and can't crit. For example even if there was unlimited debuff slots on bosses the top dps warlock rotation in naxx gear would still be shadowbolt spam. New DoT/HoT scaling was one of the big general mechanic changes 2.0 brings.
---
Karazhan, Uldum, and Varian getting rescued. 
---
just a few corrections.
---
**PvP:**
---
Priest: Troll if shadow, shadowguard and hex are serious business. Undead is better as a healer, though. (but nowhere near dwarf)
---
Mage: Undead
---
**PvE:**
---
Rogue: Orc racial wins in DPS iirc
---
Warrior (Prot): Troll, surprising enough, afaik berserking can get you a lot of extra threat
---
don't overestimate berserking for other classes, it's a nice "oh shit" button for healers, but makes next to no difference when it comes to mages.
---
One word: Pornshire. :p
---
reservoir dogs?
---
just teasing. crazy collection
---
Yes, I used it as a bear in real classic WoW. It was fairly late in 2006, so I can't say it always worked, but it did by 1.12 at least.
---
I actually made a joke about farming a bunch so you could keep using charges. I never considered actually doing it, back then . .
---
Familiarize yourself with the good quest reward weapons such as thrash blade. They are definitely worth getting while leveling. The grind is long.
---
Even without swords, there's still plenty of competition for other gear as it's shared with feral druids, hunters, and warriors.
---
If you want to be taken seriously in pve, the only thing you absolutely need is blade flurry. Human racial doesn't matter that much. You won't be among the top, but you can still do enough to be comfortable. If you go daggers, obviously race won't matter at all - you'll just have worse dps either way :)
---
Fuck.  I fell for this when I was like 13.
---
If I was Rick Harrison, I'd be all about making bad investments lol
---
&gt;They've always had them and I have no reason to suspect they'll change that now.
---
Incorrect. Vanilla was launched with only PvE, PvP, and "RP" (RPPvE) servers.
---
Never played a Druid before but damn I kind of want to now. 
---
Server structure is completly different than the business model. Blizzard is no stranger to expansion packs, and every single MMO back then had expansion packs. There was no way they weren't going to do an expansion pack. Less than a year later, they announced Burning Crusade
---
it's the same as Naxx 1 BUT WE DOUBLED IT  
---
Wow! I remember using those to knock off team mates on the Alliance Bridge to their deaths. The portal is genius!
---
Based on your criteria I think you’d like Druid. The gameplay can be incredibly creative, wpvp you can 1v1 almost anyone, a ton of class fantasy and super easy to level. Also a lot easier to find pugs as a healer. 
---
I will find some good questing items to pick up. Seeing as the human racial isnt a huge deal ill probably play gnome. But who knows human is awesome too. I think ill be using swords primarily for the dps and maybe use them in pvp too. I mean, im sure swords could still work in pvp, even if daggers are better.
---
Quilboar, my lord.
---
Daggerspine is my home :D
---
1) he has no character on private servers with the raiding gear he claimed, which he claimed he got raiding with perplexity
---
2) he is woefully ignorant on basic rogue knowledge that he would know if he had actually played. Rogues start off strong and get weaker. Perdition's blade is basically an AQ level weapon, Hemo scales awful. 
---
3) You are obviously the same person. Now you are blocked to. I don't argue with children over their internet lies.
---
Agreed, I think the height differentials that the cliffs give in the zone makes it feel enormous as well. The way you come in off the coast and have to climb up onto this huge wooded plateau gives such a sense of scale for me. 
---
Require you to have at least one lvl 60 character on a classic server to vote.
---
I agree with this to a point, and I understand that it's the prevailing opinion... but somehow people seem to forget that the Blasted Lands and Swamp of Sorrows are in Eastern Kingdoms. Blasted Lands with its constant lightning storms and the Nethergarde folks looking like an Alliance force from a totally different era, trapped out there (because they kind of are) made it feel like I was venturing into a Mars colony, only with a more fantastical style. It truly feels like the borderland between Azeroth and the now shattered world of Draenor.  
---
I've always liked themed zones in videogames... It's a staple of almost every game and I never get tired of it. One of my favorite and earliest examples of that is in Gauntlet: Dark Legacy. There's a hubworld in that game (much like the hubs in Crash Bandicoot games) called Sumner's tower. In it, you can take portals to the different realms. The portal rooms take on the theme and character of the realms that you're going to, with a classic kind of videogame artistic unity. Blasted Lands feels that way to me, particularly with all the Burning Legion in the Tainted Scar. It's   
---
Swamp of Sorrows, similarly, has a kind of generic "Indiana Jones" jungle temple feel to it, but it also incorporates some more old school, Conan-esque fantasy tropes, in my opinion. You get a sense of old magicks and necromancy with the sunken temple, dragons and magical fires, whelps roaming around, bog beasts. It feels like you could stumble into a cave and find some classic sword and sorcery scene, like Mouser performing dark magick over a bubbling green pot in the first Swords and Deviltry book. Combine that with the Broken Draenei and you get a very Warcraft kind of zone indeed.   
---
Even Eastern and Western Plaguelands, with the cult of the damned and the remnants of the scourge, while somewhat reminiscent of the cults of Angmar and the men of the North (I think, if I remember correctly), and the Barrow Wights, or the human cults that follow Sauruman and Sauron... it still has a uniquely WoW feel, to me.  
---
Just my two cents, though.
---
What was your first language?
---
Wait. Warlocks can summon themselves, hearth out and then still use that summon to get back?
---
One criticism is to up your voice volume and lower the ambience. 
---
Honestly, I don't believe that people who played the game long enough to be in a level 60 AV game would fall for that.
---
Holy crap, I'd read your books
---
That’s a balance Druid that completely outgears all their opponents but ok.
---
one thing i loved about legion was how the main city was dalaran again, i would troll people by putting up the old dalaran crater teleport instead. so many people fell for it (hehe get it they fell for it)
---
Well yeah them making separate TBC servers is a given. But that’s vastly different from adding new content to 1.12. 
---
"why tf we cant win anything"
---
The spec she is playing has 30 points in resto.  https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0p0xhMxoZZEgcocoV
---
And here I go thinking that Duskwood has some of the most atmospheric questing in all of WoW.
---
yeh id rather not have a bfa player play classic for  a few days, instantly hate the lack of some QoL feature and blindly vote for convenience.
---
trusting the playerbase to vote is a terrible idea haha
---
DWARF is the obvious choose for a pvp rogue. The racial removes dots. Dots+vanish = bad
---
Same person? Delusion? Lies? Solo Ranking? What?
---
Holy fuck I pity the people in your life who have to put up with you.
---
Fucking hilarious
---
Durotar (pre-cata) is by far one of my favorite zones in WoW, if not the most favorite. 
---
I'm sure if I held each zone side-by-side, I would end up ranking different areas higher based on aesthetics, or the stories available within. However Durotar retains some kind of purity that I guess could be chalked up in part to nostalgia, but I feel like there's something a little more to it that appeals to me.
---
Just hits the right visual and auditory notes for me, I guess.
---
Aiming for an RP server, I'm going to try and look into what the most popularily talked-about server is in those communities. For example, in GW2 all the buzz was "Go to Tarnished Coast for RP", when the game's servers had no 'RP' categories, and that worked fine.
---
It'll be harder for if you want a pve, or worse, pvp server. What happens when you want that world PVP experience only to be on like a 90/10 horde/ally server?
---
On the bright side, we're all probably old enough to afford a transfer or two in our time.
---
That solidifies it, Im maining my mage lol
---
A platypus is a monotreme 
---
At least by Shedo's guide her farmed 12-16 a week which was only an hour on the high end... I certainly hope people don't farm that for 2-3 hours a week.
---
Man, this is *almost* exactly what I'm looking for. Just wish y'all were EPGP.  
---
Honestly you'd probably fall for it once, and not again. 
---
That old AV was more like a raid than a BG back in the day. So it's easy enough to get distracted and click a port to Darn instead of a summoning portal.  
---
AS A CLASSIC PLAYER IT UPSETS ME. I AM UPSET
---
It's much more like 60%. If youre fast enough, 5 runs in 15 min and 3 pummelers for just that. 
---
Bleeds poisons and disease. Don’t lie to the man. Not all dots fall into those categories.
---
Yeeeeap.  
---
Not a bad video. I wanted once to do one about a before/after cataclysm of silverpine Forrest but you seem to have this genre on lock. I like that you aren’t a spazzing youtuber! But it’s ok to talk with confidence about your topic. All and all very cool and worth a youtube sub
---
So you get a set of gear for a shit class made for 1 spec. And im suppose to be what exactly? So jelly son. So jelly.
---
I recall it being quite a bit lower than 60%. It’s that bosses more rare drop. You’re much more likely to get his crappy green spirit boots than the mace. 60% would say otherwise.
---
Human will be the best for Rogue v Rogue pvp
---
Dwarf will be better v warriors
---
Gnome better v mages
---
We’re twisted creatures. lol
---
Hmm was inspired by him surly, shame he removed his videos :/ thanks for link though!
---
Let's go #Prot#Ret For Classic!
---
Thanks... i guess?
---
Okay ill keep that in mind, thank you!
---
I sympathize because I think they could likely be especially nitpicky and elitist about things, but I've heard they can be just as laid back as anyone, so I guess we'll find out what type of person there's more of.
---
I remember they even made an entire web page for the announcement of RP-PVP servers.  I'll see if I can find it.
---
Thanks for the feedback man, really appreciate it. I wouldn't say i have anything on lock though, that was only my second video lol.
---
You should do a silverpine video! Im sure i could put one together but as someone whos always mained alliance, I'd preffer to stick to zones i first hand know.
---
Its also in kingdom Animalia, and the phylum chordata, but most importantly it is in the class mammalia, which is what I said.
---
If I had the gear I would lol! Keep up the good work!
---
Closed beta :P
---
And this is why sharding is ACTUALLY a big deal and important to server health 
---
It's all very subjective. 
---
Honestly try to change your mentality before classic drops. It won’t be like retail where there is a optimal spec, optimal race, and if you don’t play a certain way people won’t invite you to play.
---
Yes there will always be the try hard crowd, and yes you might not see naxx for a very long time or if ever, but most of us vanilla players are older and just want to have fun.
---
If you like gnome, play gnome.
---
If you think swords look cool, use swords. Then maybe swap if you find a good dagger?
---
Vanilla is more about man hours and grinding, character building and items....there’s no big rotations or crazy procs and button mashing at optimal spec for dps meters. Raids can be accomplished with tons of random specs and fun specs, just enjoy it and take your time :)
---
43 upvotes when this has been disproven multiple times. Literally just today on classicast ythi explained the process. If 10 ppl on the same faction rcr someone a gm will get involved. Especially if you sensationalists make this to be such a big deal that it is blizzard will put systems at work to combat this...
---
Literally league has the same system and so do most all online games in 2019 and you dont see them having these "issues" 
---
X d tho keep reeeeeeing at something to pass the time.
---
From a PVE perspective, that's a bit silly.
---
Frost mage will perform well enough in MC and BWL. They did in my raids on my Pserver, they did well enough in Nost.
---
Come AQ, as bosses aren't fire resistant AND more crit/hit gear is available, allowing mages to gear more into crit and such, fire becomes baller.
---
Feel free to go on http://realmplayers.com/RaidStats/ (takes forever to load) to see the damage logs of different raids. When you click a raid, try to click on the specific bosses as well. 
---
As for PVP... at least from the mage friends I had on my ol' server, mages are generally fantastic. There's some variation in specs if you want to just have mindless fun-- an 'elemental' spec where you spam blast wave, cone of cold, and arcane blasts on less-geared enemies in a BG to just cream them. For more 'serious' stuff, mages just have a lot of options. A lot of CC, a lot of defensive abilities, etc. 
---
How does that work with healing? Does healing a group member who tagged the kill reward equivalent honor? What about a non-group member in open world PvP?
---
You have no clue how the game works if you think it shouldn't work with forms.
---
-2 karma when i comment on this. You are 100% correct tho. This community is big yikes
---
My favorite part of this is the song's guitar cascade down sometimes syncs with players getting trolled and leaving, and it sounds like a combo move in a fighting game.
---
And chance on hit, and at one point druids couldn’t do on use items in form either. 
---
I know that vanilla was not complete and druids especially were wonky.
---
Raiding often isn't much of a choice if you want to remain competitive in PvP over time. In general if you go swords I would recommend human, and if you go daggers I would recommend gnome.
---
"Swords" in PvP is called "Hemo" it doesn't literally have to be swords but it heavily prefers a slow mainhand weapon, and because you're almost certainly raiding for weapons it's probably going to be a sword. The cookie cutter build is roughly https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fhe0oxuZhZxMe0cGRo. The reason I recommend human here is mostly for PvE (the way you're going to get a weapon), you're probably not getting a sword as a non-human (or if you are it's going to be after human warriors and rogues get theirs).
---
If you decide to go daggers don't expect to have the gear to play seal fate for a very very long time (around Naxx). The cookie cutter PvP daggers build is https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fbe0oxZGcM0bZVMjcc0R, which has some overlap with the gnome racial (Imp. Sprint). This might seem bad but is actually very good because you won't have to blow sprint if you get ~~RNG'd~~ outskilled by a Mage's frostbite. I personally prefer escape artist over stoneform but it is preference.
---
Other pvp builds exist but the only other one I would recommend is [Imp. Kick daggers](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fbe0oZGccbrZVMjcc0R) or slight variations on the ones I already linked. If you see a "PvP build" without Prep, Dirty Deeds, or Improved Gouge run and distrust everything that person has to say.
---
What exactly you mean by "PvP" can effect racial effectiveness too, the gnome racial isn't as big of a deal in group PvP or battlegrounds. However it is very good in wPvP and duels. This is slightly less applicable for dwarf because of removing bleeds but generally applies as well. 
---
Yes if you’re healing people who have tagged an honor giving player you will get honor for that..for example in a BG if you’re a priest and you do a heal or some renews you’ll get the HK just like the DPS players who are on that target.  This I know for fact because my Main was a priest. 
---
It’s the same for world PvP and I am pretty sure (if my memory is correct) you don’t have to be in a group. You may want to fact check that though, I am certain you can find that answer on google somewhere- or perhaps someone here can back it up (or not) but I am fairly certain that you don’t need to be in a group to receive the HK if you heal someone (to help them out) in world PvP. Hope this helps.
---
o ya
---
Atiesh isn't about "who it benefits the most". It goes to the caster or healer officer that has been a pillar of the guild from the start. By the time you get Atiesh is will be a minimal upgrade for anyone as you'll have most of your raiders mostly in Naxx gear.
---
&gt; Late AQ/Naxx pvp goes down the crapper and everyone will reroll
---
&gt; It means more for druids in PvP so on a PvP server I think a druid should have priority
---
PVP goes down the drain so let's give it as a PVP item to someone that is going to PVP on a dead PVP scene. What a great plan!
---
&gt; doing something they don't want to be doing anyways (healing in Naxx) 
---
Yeah let's give the last legendary in Vanilla to a guy that hates coming to raid, that's a good idea. You have no clue what you're talking about. There's a reason why Atiesh rarely goes to druids.
---
I've shifted from no life min maxing, to just chill as yolo duoing with a friend. As much as I enjoy the min/max, I know Vanilla is about the journey, and don't want to miss out on creating new memories (nothing against the No Life way, I respect it).
---
We'll be Warrior/Priest potentially, but most likely Warrior/Druid. Don't think the Druid combo is great because of the speed difference, but we're not worried about what's optimal. We'll get insta groups for any 5 mans, and can probably duo some of the tougher elite quests too. 
---
In Kalimdor i always liked that there where pockets of civilization (mainly in the north) then the further you move away it gets really wild and untamed quickly. Gives the sense that if you want to leave the gates of Ogrimnar better make sure you have supplies and are prepared for the trials you will face. 
---
Oh wait, I remember now.  There was a part of the questline that had you pay a substantial amount of money, I think 50g indeed, and I think at some other point the questline involved an NPC at the camp where there's a Flight Master for Alliance.  That's probably what it is, aha!
---
Atiesh usually goes to the cdps officer and sometimes to the healer officer. It's not going to a feral druid first unless the guild is doing that for the memes.
---
If you actually looked at your source you'd learn that every single vanilla item on WowHead was added in 1.10/1.11 regardless of when they were added in the game.
---
Don't use shit sources to back up your poor reasoning.
---
Hey there! I am not too familiar with that system? What did you like about it?
---
I’m concerned that nobody seems to able to wanna play PvE. On the classic discord literally every post is about recruitment on PvP, literally zero PvE. I wanna go hard when classic comes out, but on PvE, I find it most comfy, especially cause I play healers and it’s not fun for me to gank. 
---
I know guilds will pop up as the time approaches but I figured there’d be *some* options by now.
---
That was most likely changed during TBC as that comment is multiple months after TBC was released, while both comments saying it stacks were talking about Vanilla. (The initial comment was only 1 week into the TBC prepatch).
---
"Most DOTs"
---
* Corruption
---
* Curse of Agony
---
* Immolate
---
* Moonfire
---
* Insect Swarm
---
* Shadow Word: Pain
---
* Holy Fire (okay this one isn't gonna be used)
---
* Fireball DoT
---

---
* Works vs. hunters if they don't know about their flare/volley abilites
---
Its only good vs. rogues and warriors, and rogues' best match-up is warrior regardless of being a dwarf or not. Stop kidding yourself.
---
This takes 6 minutes in vanilla?
---
Best answer is Druid. 
---
Good leveler
---
Best dungeon tank and early MC/Ony
---
Fairly rare
---
Travel speed
---
Can port to Moonglade and walk over to Feralas/Winterspring for some quick wPvP between BG queues. 
---
I plan on getting Rank 12 if it’s somewhat reasonable, because the 3 piece +15% movement speed boost is SO SEXY. 
---
Then, fill the rest of the gear with T1/2/2.5/whatever I have that is best. 
---
Get one or both of the 1h shapeshift attack power weapons from world bosses and AQ. So no need to get R14, necessarily unless you really want the staff. Just need a really good raiding/pvp guild because world bosses are going to be super competitive. 
---
A few of the bis pvp items for a long time are blues like +8 all stats offhand and Heart of the Mountain. 
---
You can get some really good bis items from grinding like Myrmidon signet and the darkmoon fair necklace. 
---
Druid builds are super flexible and one can be picked for pvp that will mix a large variety of gear well. If your highest item level gear is a mix of feral and healing gear, which it probably will be, you can just do a 1/29/21 “Heart of the Wild” spec. 
---
I plan on getting a large range of gear, including heavy armor and resists, then use an addon like Outfitter or something to swap to, say, a bunch of frost resist if I’m about to pounce on a Mage casting fbolts, or a bunch of armor for a hunter/warrior/rogue/etc, making them easy pickings. 
---
Due to druids using all the stats, there are quite a few raiding epics most people won’t consider very good, which you could probably pick up for cheap (dkp wise). According to most BIS raiding strategies I’ve seen, people only bring 2-3 druids typically, so there won’t be too much competition for your tier sets. 
---
Soft-counters mages
---
Throwing in priest as 2nd best because they are GODLIKE in PvP, absolutely destroy people. Always in demand in premade BGs and raids. 
---
Anathema/Benediction is almost as strong as HWL staff and super easy to get right at the beginning as long as you get the drops, which you may not unless you show your guild you’re a dedicated raider. Their pvp gear is very good for them. 
---
Other than Mage, For pure DPS I’d say Hunter because they can snipe well in BGs, particularly as they mana drain the pesky mages and priests, and Rok’Delar bow/weapon. 
---
Hunters actually aren’t very good though unless you can play them perfectly. Players are going to be much better now than they were back then and know how to deal with them better. 
---
34 here with a full time job. Also a wife, house, and 3 cats to take care of. My plan is to play my warlock until she gets home from work, then I'll switch to my warrior with her pocket healing on her priest the rest of the time. It's gonna be real tough, especially because we get high on the weekends which might interfere with the raiding schedule, but we're really dedicated to making it work.
---
 No comment was after 2.1 and one comment mentions it being changed in vanilla.
---
Right, forgot chance on hit, which happens when you *swing the weapon*, which druids obviously don't do.
---
There's a lot of things that "didn't work" at some point or another in vanilla, and even then it has nothing to do with an item increasing your attack speed working.
---
Not Sunday anymore (actually Tuesday where I am lol), but does anyone remember a video parody of some guy playing a mage pretending he knows how to play when it's clear he bought the account?
---
I remember I saw it on Google Video (DAE REMEMBER GOOGLE VIDEO???) back in like late 04 or early 05 and never was able to find it again.
---
This is the ideal dwarf body. You may not like it, but this is what peak DPS looks like.
---
Definitely don't skip Flurry
---
To be clear, a 5-9 wow shift means you play for 16 hours every night. Not 4. 
---
When do you sleep? Good question. On this plan you actually sleep at work, since most modern 9-5 jobs involve pretending to be busy at your computer for half the day since we are still on Henry Ford's production schedule.
---
Anyone else explore the entire continent just to have a full map before achievements were added, in BC of course?
---
Awesome work! Bookmarked for sure. 
---
Blizzard worked on the Alliance zones before they did the Horde zones, they spent more time on Alliance than Horde.
---
When the Alliance wants the Scarlet Crusade put down... but in the end they were right all along bout the Forsaken.
---
There’s nothing in *any* patch notes mentioning a nerf and Furor+Wolfshead Helm was still being stacked for +60 energy in 2008 from a post I found. Not going to link it since it’s on a website that also advertises cheats/exploitd/gold selling but it’s one of the first results when searching “wolfshead tbc”. 
---
I’m going to trust someone that actually theorycrafted and tested using wolfshead in late TBC over some random wowhead comments. 
---
I played most classes both factions and I was looking forward to playing horde for the racials...but then someone posted those eastern kingdoms maps and i saw a youtube video of someone fighting defias mobs and damn, memories came flooding in.  Honestly I do think I have better memories of the alliance side of the game.  Elywyn Forest &gt; Westfall &gt; Duskwood &gt; Redridge the 1-20 game alone was just fuckin sweet.  Hogger, the defias questline and escort quest, Deadmines, Stitches just tons of named mobs and memories.  I don’t know, I guess I felt like horde side was just more grindy.  My 2c.
---
fake af but cool vid 
---
Fuck how I envy you. My dad is the worst type of boomer who hates just about anything different/experiences he personally didn’t have growing up.
---
You are so up your own ass
---
Just speculating, but EPGP is less intuitive and well-known and so probably too complicated for most casual guilds to put the effort into learning and using, and more hardcore guilds use LC. Also for Vanilla specifically, EPGP's decay feature is kinda lame as you raid so much farm content and will likely want to hoard for a certain few drops after awhile. Seems most plausible to me but idk for sure
---
Just your particular experience. I haven’t played since Cata (except for a short stint in WoD) but all though BC, WotLK, and Cata, every guild I was in only used EPGP. It was by far the most used system for raiding guilds in my experience because the “round robin” loot distribution that it endgenders tends to feel the fairest, and therefore minimizes loot drama to the extent possible. I’m sure many Classic raiding guilds will use it as well.
---
The resemblance is uncanny.
---
Gotta ask, having leveled every class that much, which one do you think is the most fun?
---
After enjoying the nostalgia surrounding stonetalon mountains with you all with my last post, I decided to find another place here on earth that inspired the landscapes of Azeroth. This took me way longer to find than I am willing to admit, so I hope you enjoy it!  
---

I was saying I hope it's good too. Just in a way that was like I hope your fears don't come true also. All in all though  I'm hopeful that it will be good.
---
Barth or Frost, decisions...
---
Back in Vanilla, people were just literally copying systems from other games that had already been invented. DKP was a system that was easy to implement and track and rewarded hardcore raiders which was great for retaining talent. Unfortunately, it made getting gear extremely difficult for new players.
---
You have to remember that it was 2005. We didn’t have google docs, automated tracking, or even really good excel spreadsheets. When DKP is as simple as “kill x get y points” and “a item is worth b points”, with limited tools, that’s simply good enough.
---
upWards and Anti-right
---
5 instances resets per hour. You arent’t farming that many in an hour unless you only count play time and log out to wait out the resets, and even then it’ll still take a few hours. 
---
No, it's not a decent option. You just don't get enough xp. I'd imagine it's at least twice as slow as efficient solo questing. So if you play 2 hours a day instead of taking 4 months to get to 60 it would take 8 months to get to 60.
---
Maybe ask on the Kickstarter
---
Extra longer unless you somehow manage to get an ultra efficient group to level with that will constantly chainpull and clear dungeons in record times. Which is obviously not going to happen since those tryhard players will be optimizing their leveling routes. The only good XP from dungeons is from the quests. 
---
I doubt anyone has theorycrafted a dungeon-only leveling route, and you need to remember that you’ll have to wait for everyone to get there every single time. There’s also very few dungeons to do in level brackets so you’ll be running the same 1-2 dungeons over and over and over grinding XP off the trash at a horrible rate. 
---
Do every single dungeon 1-2 times (more if you enjoy them) if you want to but don’t try to be only doing dungeons. 
---
That was my experience running up to the Scarlet Monastery the first time.  I thought they were PC's.  I was /y'ing at them begging them not to kill me anymore.  That I was too low level for them to to find any enjoyment out of it.
---
Yup, 6 mins.
---
Wouldn't this be more like... The badlands?
---
I thought all Shamans were resto shamans.  Embarrassed the hell out of myself in front of my enhancement raid lead.   
---
*inserts your mom jokes*
---
Damn askjeeves is a hardcore place to work huh
---
How do you function on 4.5 hours?!?!?!
---
Thank you! I hope we do as well!
---
I am sorry to hear that man. Fuckin boomers
---
I somehow made 60 and was in a ZG raid when a fellow rogue asked me if I was using "slice n dice".  I replied "of course not".  It was my understanding that my poison procs would proc far too often and that I would have to re-up mid fight.  He started to explain white / yellow damage and then referred me to the "elitest jerks" forum.  I finally learned the game at max level.  
---
Also not knowing how to chat.  It was all /w and /y until mid level 20.  Didn't know how to talk in general.  Never crossed my mind to type / and a number.  
---
This video reminds me of how people voted for Brexit in the UK
---
Ok so in that case all feral druids were horrible players and had no idea how to plat their class in real vanilla and the only excuse for their failures is they were bad.
---
I tried out Vanilla on a friend's account back in 2004 and begged my parents to buy it for me (I was 12 at the time). They weren't willing to pay for the $15 subscription so I played Runescape up until 2008 when I finally convinced them that it should be a birthday present. It's too bad I missed out on most of Vanilla, but at least I got in on TBC. 
---
Reminds me of all the times our main raiding tank would tell us in Vent that he dragged something off his bar mid fight but couldn't figure out what it was.  "Eh, I'll figure it out when I need it".
---
some kind of detrivore
---
My brother straight grinded for the first 15 levels.  He didn't know quests were a thing. 
---
and?
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?item=9449](https://classicdb.ch/?item=9449) says 40%
---
[https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Manual\_Crowd\_Pummeler](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Manual_Crowd_Pummeler) says "the estimated drop rate is 33%"
---
ClassicDB typically is the best source for these sorts of things. Your results may vary. 
---
The best I came up with was when someone asked how to do something in general chat, I told them to just press alt and F4 at the same time.  It worked like 30% of the time and made me chuckle. 
---
If normally you get lvl 60 in 6-8days played, you would get lvl 60 in 18-20 days. I have never done it though so try yourself, but it feels like a 0.33 rate compared to solo farming. 
---
I played on Cenarius Alliance and remember 2 hordies at 59 with epic mount. Was very frustrating and I think they only did WSG.
---
hype will last a few months, but the game should last at least a year and a half before people get bored of it again
---
Rank 14 and a job? Don't be silly, R14 is 12+ hours a day if your server''s pvp pop is competitive. Every other grind (except aq scepter) can usually be done on your own time.
---
Overall your only choice is playing a bit more casually or buying levelling/gold though.
---
Well, there is a few points:
---
1) There is too much of a hassle to get all the quests before doing the dungeon, run there on your pair of legs and wait for the group to do the same. By that time you would already get significant chunk of exp if you've just stayed on the same place and grinded some boars instead. Speedrunners never ever considering doing 5mans for a reason.
---
2) Unlike retail, there is a HUGE GAP between the mobs at the entrance and the final part of the dungeon. It is possible that the first mobs will be gray, while the last boss is still yellow and the quests/rewards are staying relevant at the same time. Which makes it not that good f9r grind in general - you're killing elite mobs, spending many resources with a very little rewards in return.
---
3) However, there is an exception. It's called Scarlet Monastery. 
---
SM, unlike the most dungeons in vanilla, is not a maze, it's linear and tightly-packed with mobs, just like the future BC/retail dungeons. I can't remember the exact numbers but let's say you can get 40k+ per hour with a decent group and 100k+ per hour if you've being boosted with a high lvls AoE'ing down. 
---
Moreso, p.2 is not an issue there either, because you choose the wing with appropriate level range.
---
Very decent gear too, which makes more sense to go for it, those pieces can easily last you to 60 if you're unlucky or not worrying about getting the upgrades. 
---
So yeah, if there is anything I'd rather go for SM, not leaving the hall and waiting for groups until you get your gear and levels. You can follow by some ZF and Mara princess runs (the ones you do with a Scepter, you don't wanna run Maraudon from scratch everytime :D), those also have some decent gear for most classes that can last you till the 60. 
---
For the rest, I wouldn't bother. Even if you're not min-maxing (if you're doing dungeosn you aren't anyway), it's just not worth it.
---
I posted it higher up but I didn't use slice n dice until I found myself in a ZG raid and another rogue commented on it.  Poisons had a set number of times they could be applied to a target and I didn't want slice n dice to cause me to have to re-up my poisons mid fight.  I was introduced to forums and theory crafting that day.  Learned about the differences between white and yellow damage for starters. 
---
Sorry for delay! Works been busy~. IMO arguably best pocket healers in contention with pallies and when paired with a geared warrior becomes very strong.  When you get gear with fears and divine shields become insanely tanky
---
You don't need to grind in 1.12. There are leveling guides out there where there might be 3-4 levels of grinding that is completely negated if you just do SOME of the leveling dungeons once and quests.
---
I usually used the James one open on another monitor that had maps and it still worked fine even when a lot of the quests weren't in due to progressive on private.
---
Alliance. Until 20 just split up two areas. Jump to the other one around 10. So if human go to the dwarves or NE and jump back and forth as needed. At 20ish do Dead Mines Then Boston's guide from 20-30

---
There might be some TBC quests in there. It's not that big a deal. Like I said just do some instances. Black Fathom Depths, SM etc. You don't have to do a lot, but you are going to want quest rewards/dungeon gear anyways.
---
*cough*
---
Yeah, it’s totally askjeeves
---
I love the mood in the undead starting zone. 
---
Warriors always constitute like 55%(no exaggeration) of private servers population, so assuming similar server makeup can be a competitive class to get a raid spot.  Mage is considerably easier to do "well enough" in raid setting and always in high demand due to the countless fights that prefer ranged DPS to melee in the first few vanilla raids.  Don't know enough about hunters to weigh in , always seemed kinda boring to me and aren't really topping dps charts throughout vanilla.
---
Working 9-5 sounds easy. Just raid at night. 8-11 or 8-12 or something. That's when most guilds raid anyways. It's actually ideal.
---
I'm not sure what I'm going to do though. My job schedule is completely random. Some days I open, some days I close, some days I work a mid shift. The days are random too. Some weeks I work weekends. Some weeks I don't. Some weeks I might have Wednesday off. Some weeks I might have Friday off. Who knows. I think my only option is to like play on an oceanic realm and raid with the kangaroos at like 3am lol.
---
Rank14 will not be possible with a 8-5 job. A friend of mine who did the grind spent about 14-16hours a day for 3 months to reach it. I suppose the time investment will differ depending on server population and pvp activity.
---
I'd go so far as to say that Classic should just be listed as, "World of Warcraft."
---
It wasn't, as far as I can remember, ever called, "Vanilla," at the time. I guess that I'm just being picky as shit, but it's still wicked cool to see when people started their WoW journey.
---
Have you ever tanked or healed in low lvl vanilla? Tanking is very slow and frustrating with a high repair bill and healing is drinking after most pulls and using 2 stacks of water each run. As a tank/healer it feels very fresh to just grind mobs and do quests after a dungeon run.
---
The 1handers are BiS for pve.
---
Every mana class except holy paladin goes OOM &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; quickly. As a vanilla player I had actually forgotten what a HUGE part of the gameplay this is. You have to learn how to downrank, when to take breaks from casting, and constantly play in a way that doesn't drain you. But, in classic Blizzard fashion, the system balances itself in beautiful ways. If you're willing to push toward OOM and risk being defenseless, you can really make things happen. And having any healing capability is actually a huge deal because the pure DPS classes typically can't recover a single percent of their HP through abilities. The rogue's energy lasts forever, but his HP never comes back. The class identity that people rave about also comes with suffering and wanting...but man it makes the game so great
---
Amazing the resemblance is astonishing
---
&gt; DKP has always been more popular, however. Any reason why?
---
Its extremely rare on private servers and EPGP is even more rare. Most guilds by far use Loot Council.
---
Wow, politics in a wow sub smh 
---
I see you disabled your UI for this screenshot.
---
bahahahahaha
---
r/accidentalPolitics
---
I'd personally say mage.
---
Warlock and Hunter are easier to level but (I think) less "dynamic" for leveling and are (if my Vanilla memory serves) less wanted in raids and dungeons.
---
Warrior is not as good of a leveler and can be great DPS but will get pigeonholed as a tank in dungeons.
---
Rogue is also a good choice but they don't stack as well so if they're a popular choice it's easy to be less wanted (a 5 man with a tank, priest, shaman/paladin, and mage would take another mage. A  man with a tank, priest, shaman/paladin, and rogue would really rather have a mage than another rogue).
---
Maybe private servers have changed how people view it, but that's my memory.
---
I'd go mage. A full pvp gear/naxx gear mage is better than one without, but a mage with good dungeon gear and maybe a little bit of early raid gear is still great.
---
I'll almost certainly level a warrior first because it's what I love to play, but after I admit that I'll never get to play enough to get the stuff I want, I'll probably have a mage as my second.
---
Terrible advice dude...
---
My first thought. 
---
What is Ignite stacking?
---
You have this completely backwards. Hybrids were intentionally terrible at DPS. Blizzard vanilla devs have admitted this. You don’t want vanilla design, you want what you think is vanilla while ignoring every inconvience.
---
Moreover modern Blizzard is not capable of creating vanilla content. Literally. The current devs are different people with different ideas, skills, toolsets and even different software than those in vanilla.
---
Lol its easier for horde to get to Gnomer than Alliance.
---
Quit it

Natures grace/Moonglow healing with and you'll be casting fast healing touches like never before.

Im in a pre-guild already that contains IRL friends. Whatever server they end up on is fine by me.

That pic reminds me of Horizon: Zero Dawn :o
---
FWIW World of Warcraft has, for the life of the game, been the possibly the most well known MMO that sticks to the "holy trinity" tank vs. healer vs. dps gameplay.
---
In WoW for example but in most PvE &amp; RPG oriented MMORPGs for that matter, tanks take by far the most heat from the enemies and damage overall, where (ideally) over 90% of the time the enemy NPC's are attacking the tank classes. This means that in World of Warcraft PvE tanks focus mostly on doing what they can to keep themselves alive and keeping the enemies attacking themselves all the time.
---
In contrast, tanks in WoW PvP (not frequently played for that matter, but that's a different story) and tanks in MOBAs have a much more dynamic playstyle that emphasizes control of fights through crowd control and personal durability. Often, MOBA / PvP style tanks have a significant "support" flavor to improve the general "team support" and "fight control" playstyle.
---
Playing "Tanks" in PvP style games in general (be it WoW PvP and MOBAs) can't make guarantees that "Tanks" in WoW PvE can: in PvP there's little guarantee that the enemy will actually bother to attack you at all.. For example, a daggers/ambush Rogue should never *choose* to fight a relatively equally geared &amp; skilled Protection Paladin / Warrior because it's just a fight that they will lose most times (would attempt to pick off the healer healing them 100% of the time unless braindead)..
---
Where in WoW PvE the Gnome Warrior "Shortstackz" yelling at &amp; reducing the armor of "Ragnaros the Elemental Lord of Fire" over and over makes Ragnaros sufficiently pissed at "Shortstackz" that he repeatedly smashes "Shortstackz" with his 100 ton hammer (to little effect) over the course of 10 minutes, while the other 39 guys behind "Ragnaros the Elemental Lord of Fire" poke him in the back / throw icicles at him until he dies

So about half as common as 60% which would be quite a bit lower and more often than not you aren’t getting the mace.

&gt;If that was the case all feral druids were horrible players and had no idea how to play their class in real vanilla and the only excuse for their failures is they were bad
---
Implying keyboard turner clicker could have pulled of this trick. And it wouldn't surprise me that people didn't figure you could use this helm that way until way later.
---
Same thing about the gnome mace, nobody thought about farming it and using it back then.
---
There are guides about power shifting from bc era that say the helm do stack with furor.

I think I can see Mankriks wife!

where's mankrik's wife?

You know mate, I’m a huge noob when it comes to classic wow. But please try to somewhat think about this advice:
---
As somebody who is VERY indecisive, whatever I do, I wish I had your mindset. It shines from your sentences that you prefer the hunter.
---
You know, when somebody says “hunter” you’re like, “well that’s the class I plan on maining!” Whereas the lock it’s like “yes, but, hunter...”
---
Whatever downside the hunter may have, you can make it work as long as you like playing it brother.
---
I hope I somewhat helped you. I’ll be sitting here thinking about if I should play warrior, hunter, druid or warlock. Or mage. Or priest. Or shaman. Or paladin......... fuck.
---
And where's the chat? This pic is fake. I call bullshit.
---
this guy fucks
---
Dwarf is stronger in rogue vs rogue. Immune bleeds/blind is more powerful than guaranteed opener if you're talking strictly 1v1.
---
1. Preference over utility; if you like gnome more than human roll gnome &amp; vica versa. Especially in PvP your skill will be more important than a racial.
---
2. Leveling: Swords is the go-to build but daggers are useable as well. I'd recommend swords. PvE raiding/PvP combined build would be combat daggers for higher dps or seal fate for higher fun.
---
3. Don't know, don't care. Rogue + PvP = daggers.
---
4. Personal preference: big crit dagger builds. No prep or hemo builds. If you want to pvp in bg's you don't have much utility besides trying to creep up on clothies and trying to bomb them.
---
5. Can't help with that.
---
Always played a Rogue in vanilla. Mostly raided hardcore, didn't do much PvP so this is just my take on this.
---
Assuming you had a group at all times, no wipes, and little to no downtime, you'd probably be looking at like 4-5 hour levels lol, which is 2-3x slower than regular questing. 
---
&gt;I'm happy with moderate changes that are wanted by the community as a whole
---
Here's the issue with that. Everything in modern WoW that people in the classic community don't like, everything from transmog to mount spam to LFR to dungeon finder to flying mounts to removing talent trees has been asked for by the community. Hell, I can remember threads from the old battle.net forums on each and every one of those topics back in vanilla. 
---
Giving the community a say in what gets added to the game is a sure-fire pathway to ruin. 
---
I was in Thailand recently and had this feeling like  I was in STV

What a brilliant idea for a guild :)

Just over those mountains are the lush green plains of Mulgore

I have a script that types out the good old pickpocket trick, but it has a random amount and whether it's "successful" or not it will display a certain message. Granted I didn't write it myself, but it's pretty funny when people still fall for it.
---
he played age of empires while doing this.
---
PvE servers were more popular in Vanilla. However, the more hardcore types (not even talking 16 hours a day players, but just the kind who would hang out here) played PvP. There will certainly be a huge population for PvE realms once the game is out again. 
---
or girlfriend and boyfriend... who knows what hides in the depths of the mountain...

about 40% started after Wrath. Sorry you missed the party. :p
---
You can play vanilla just fine with a 9-5 job. Takes longer to level obviously, but if you have some vacation to spare maybe take a week. If not, don't worry about it. Classic will be classic for a long time and alot of people often reroll after a few months when they find out (or think) that the grass is greener on the other side. If you stick to one character, you will do just as well as many people who play alot more and mess around with alts all the time. 
---
I used to play vanilla and no-life it like crazy. At some point during vanilla i got a job (because i somehow finished school eventhough my attendance was abyssmal). Even with a job i could raid and do everything i wanted. Granted i had pretty much no commitments apart from the job. Today i have a wife and children and a carrieer that takes up alot of time, yet still i don't worry about it because i know i will do well in classic. I clear MC and BWL for sure, as i did back in the day and that is my goal. Time will show if i will clear more than that but even clearing those you are well off. It will takes a long time before AQ and Naxx is even out, so you have time. Most people who go balls-deep and no-life it 12+ hours a day will run out of things to do apart from PvP ranking. You can easily clear MC and Onyx in an evening with a decent guild and if you are in a less than optimal one it may take you two nights. Big deal ? What else are you going to do. You ain't hitting any high ranks regardless, so you will clear the raids and do some pvp fun and do some dungeons and at some point you will run out of BIS pre-raid because you will slowly get raid gear also, probably have raid gear well before you have BIS pre-raid in most cases. 
---
So long story short. Don't worry about it, you will do fine if you set your mind to it - just don't expect to be ranking in any meaningful way. You can still PvP though and if you are good at PvP you can probably beat some of the high ranked players (not all of them are that great, some just have alot of time and a bunch of skilled people to carry them). 
---
Could use a six demon bag too
---
No you will not get Rank 14 PvP, forget that.
---
Ngl, darkshore is a pretty cool area for 12-20
---
Thanks man
---
Did you break out into a cold sweat and dive into some nearby foliage for cover?
---
Quite a bit, in EU launch we did aoe instance trash grind within guild in SM library, it was semi ok. Warrior, 2 mages, warlock and i was priest healing. Did BIG pulls, but because you get a lot less xp in 5 man group, i dont think any of the lower level instances are worth doing more than the quest runs. MAYBE if you are a warrior and the instance gives a HUGE weapon upgrade you might want to do 1-2 extra tries to get it.
---
I like it! Keep on posting! 
---
My private server experience was that it was slooow. I played a DPS/healer so there was a lot more downtime in between runs than a tank would experience, but I just didn't get much exp during dungeons from mobs. I ran each dungeon enough to do the quests and to have a decent chance at snagging the must-have gear, but unless I liked the dungeon or the specific group I wasn't running anything more than I needed to. 
---
Also I was usually rested and it was still slow but I'm not sure how rested works with group exp.
---
I think TBC re-release is inevitable in the future. I'm not saying they won't keep Classic servers, but TBC is the most favorite expansion for many people and there are no high-quality TBC pservers.
---
This man speaks the truth. There's also the aesthetics factor in which, again, Dwarf wins.

Awesome, glad that you were able to find your passion from a game moment too!

Programming tools is also one of the things I really enjoy doing - I can see why it fascinated you.

You’d think. But honestly these mountains just make my think Barrens. Good find, OP.

Wisdom from the Brady Master Guide!

Bring me all the ingredients so I can make sticky ribs!

Bring me... all the ingredients... so I can make... sticky... ribs. 
---
As much as it hurts me to say this, it could be simply a marketing. They are probably confident it's gonna be profitable thanks to low development costs.
---
I'm not sure what's purpose of your comment. Are you trying to say they won't release TBC? If yes, what makes you believe that? Or you simply don't want TBC to be released?
---
I find it pretty solid actually. OP should stop thinking what he should do and do what he feels he would enjoy. He hasnt even entered the game yet and already thinking about min maxing. The advice given here is important. Vanilla is not a minmax game and anyone approaching it as such loses out of experiencing the game fully. 
---
**Preface**: opinions are my own.. my opinions as to advantages / disadvantages have less sourcing than experience, but should enable you to have the information you need. 
---
* I had no idea I'd sit down and spend 40 minutes writing a reply, but this reply should be a good guide with respect to "which spec to pick" for Mages. 
---
* Note: for group gameplay, you'll want to look at the "PvP" and "PvE" sections in particular because they primarily target comparisons between Mage specs for either battleground PvP or dungeons (5/10 mans) or raids. 
---
* Note: my discussions talk about &amp; assume talents and sometimes even gear that are primarily going to be available to high level mages only. If you're not yet 60, *you mine as well just go frost* regardless :) 
---
Advantages/Disadvantages for each spec per gameplay style (not going to talk about Mage inherent supporting utility like  :
---
**Frost**:
---
* **PvP:** good sustained damage (doesn't go oom nearly as fast as other specs), *underhyped* burst damage through ice shards+shatter+cold snap (not an "I WIN" button like 3 minute mage, but very strong and very frequently available), the best CC's in the game bar none via standard mage kit + strong frost CC (example: Frostbite+Permafrost+Improved Blizzard talents), strong sustain/survivability tools via Ice Block+Ice Barrier. Note: you need to go "Deep Frost" for most viable frost PvP (don't skip Ice Barrier/Ice Block, they're good)
---
* **PvE:** *the best* **sustained** caster dps in the game (and the only spec to raid with) until AQ/Naxx comes out some quantity of years from now. In raids, you'll be casting Frostbolt 95% where otherwise occasionally casting Blizzard for AoE and Polymorph for CC. In dungeons, you'll be able to take full advantage of the damage and CC side of your kit that I'd mentioned in PvP section, though at least in most 5 man dungeons Fire is a better nuking spec. Note: you can spec two ways here: the "Arcane Power" build which is mostly Arcane tree + some frost talents where you're going to push out the maximum dps capable; as an alternative the "Deep Frost/Winter's Chill" build which is more or less the same as the pvp spec which takes all of the Frost talents up to the "Winter's Chill" talent which provides a debuff that increases crit chance of frost spells against an enemy by 10% for the whole raid (does less dps but is more versatile and less gear dependent / more support focused)
---
* **Leveling:** the *best* leveling spec, could go other ways but Frost's strong damage overall (burst via shatter? check. mana efficiency? check. reliable sustained damage? Frostbolt - check.) with strong CC capabilities, the best solo AoE capabilities in the game (AoE grinding w/ Mages are available from a low level throughout the game and is incredibly efficient) and little to no downtime (you're going to get hit less because enemies are perpetually CC'ed so you take less damage) while also having the best survivability tools. No brainer choice here
---
* **WPvP:** it's good. See PvP
---
**Fire**:
---
* **PvP:** you can go a few ways here, but in general you're looking at the most classic "**glass cannon**" gameplay available to World of Warcraft. Fire Mages frequently hit harder &amp; faster than Frost Mages, but burn out faster for a multitude of reasons: through lower mana efficiency then frost, higher reliance on either unreliable procs or long term cooldowns, and lacking crucial survivability talents like Ice Block and Ice Barrier. That said, the "3 minute mage" spec that uses iconic talents Pyroblast+Arcane Power + Presence of Mind via a spec like [this talent tree I just cooked up](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#odxE0RfougG0zrZ0h) \+ strong gear from raids that includes powerful trinkets like [ToEP](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18820) can effectively 1 shot any player every 3 minutes from a single macro (downsides are obvious but are generally "you're pretty ineffective outside of these 3 minute burst periods")
---
* **PvE:** would be strong if most of Molten Core and Blackwing Lair's enemies didn't have high fire resistances. Unfortunately, Ragnaros only gets tickled by Fireball as you would expect. "But these are just two raids!" Molten Core / BWL will likely be 90% of the time spent raiding for the 90% of Classic WoW raiders and thus raiding as fire is impossible... though this situation changes in Naxx / AQ, where resistances no longer being a problem fire becomes the dominant caster dps spec in the game (instead of frost previously) through Fireball having higher spell damage scaling and the talent Ignite giving huge bonus damage on crits. In dungeons, fire is generally viable... except for numerous enemies in LBRS/UBRS/BRD that have high fire resistance which is very inconvenient.
---
* **Leveling:** perfectly viable and enjoyable as long as you're okay with the lower survivability and CC compared to frost. Your nuking potential is high and you can use Pyroblast for very effective &amp; efficient fight openers on NPC's. Overall though, the damage isn't really that much higher than frost (if at all due to requiring a lot more movement let alone downtime due to having to stop to eat more because taking more damage) where fire needs a lot of crit &amp; damage gear to start to become scary - you won't have these things while leveling
---
* **WPvP:** "3 minute mage" explained in PvP section above is hilarious and works very well in the low intensity / infrequent fighting of world PvP. Otherwise, you're definitely better off with Frost
---
**Arcane:** I can go into each specific section, but the general gist of it is the Arcane tree is a support tree that augments Fire or Frost without having much to contribute on its own right (see "Arcane Power" Frost dps builds online or "3 Minute Mage" builds such as the one I linked above). "But I like Arcane Missiles because they're cool!" Arcane Missiles has terrible scaling with +dmg, low/moderate damage over time compared to Frostbolt/Fireball, terrible damage per mana, and doesn't ever crit. Outside of Arcane Missiles, Arcane spells bring nothing to the table you wouldn't already have with Frost or Fire
---
I was Alliance on Akama back in 2005-2012, it wasn't uncommon to see Pink Pwnies trolling one way or another. Good times I miss it. ARMY OF LIGHT FTW
---
Nothing like walking into a fresh new town/city and getting a bunch of these -_-
---
I have a theory that we needed to get to Hellfire Peninsula somehow. The Black Morass instance and Karazhan were already planned for the game and present in the game files, both of which were are directly tied to Medivh, who originally opened the Dark Portal. 
---
I bet there's something in both of those we needed to re-open the Dark Portal. Maybe reforge Ashbringer while we're there.
---
That looks nothing like the barrens. It's too dry and dusty. The barrens is a Savannah not a desert. 
---
It would be long. It would be fun.
---
Id recommend questing to get dungeon quests at least.
---
Id do it
---
It would get boring anyway... you would need to do the same dungeon atleast 5+ MINUMUM times just to get to the next one.
---
Reminds me of the the Ice Block troll people used to do in the Sapphiron fight
---
I played since wrath - wod then quit and came back in bfa for 2 months and then quit again
---
I honestly doubt there will be enough servers at launch.
---
Trust me, owls are overrated as fuck, it's pretty much a meme at this time, cats still better than them, don't waste your time, just get a cat at durotar and you should be fine.
---
I'll be leveling a night elf and I will play with cats, they have the most damage early game.

I'm 25 I started on the very tail end of vanilla right about 1.12 iirc.  I really got into it during BC and was able to clear BT and even a few bosses in Sunwell, but now all I really want is to see the one part that I feel I missed.  Already planning on taking vacation from work for release.
---
Which way is Uldaman?
---
The new 4k texrure pack is just awesome.
---
One step at a time. Tank some 60 dungeons and off tank a couple raids to get the hang of it. Guilds tend to be very cautious about the MT position since it's the most important one
---
You don't typically.  Thats a "Manditory 5 hours of sleep or i'll die at work" window.  What it means is you get a manditory 4.5 to 5 hours and then you shift around the remaining time between leisure and extra sleep on the fly.  One night it might be 6 hours of sleep.  Other night is 7.  Pulled a big binger because you had a solid group running? 5 hours of sleep.
---
About 2 years before world of Warcraft vanilla :)
---
team python was a team called with one of the first first private servers, just a few NPC's in menethil harbor and some spiders in burning steps but I knew already back then that I was about to be hooked. then followed us and kr opens beta and onwards :)
---
This is what i call a real n00b-filter.
---
It's not really hard, you're just expected to play a lot. As long as you research dungeons/raids before you do them you'll be fine. Most vanilla raid bosses can be explained in 1 - 2 minutes so there's really no obstacles to becoming a MT. Y To stand out and get in a good guild with no setup though you'll probably have to no life it a bit to get to 60 quickly.
---
Well assuming you roll warrior then give it your best shot.  If you arn't rolling warrior you are kind of dreaming about tanking a raid.  Only warriors get to tank raids.
---
Having said this I do plan to fund a side tank paladin to do 5 man and 10 mans with for funzies.
---
They had me in the first half, not gonna lie.
---
Anyone who says it's not a decent option for a warrior is speaking from a perspective of minimizing their time to 60, in which case they're correct.
---
However I leveled a troll warrior on a server that rhymes with tightfinger, starting shortly after the release of the BWL patch.  It was one of the most enjoyable gaming experiences of my life, and I would also argue that from a wider perspective it is also pretty damn time efficient.
---
I specced full prot and started tankig pretty much exclusively as I finished in the barrens, my /played to 60 was ten days and a couple hours.  I'd say this time is easily achievable for anyone who's willing to learn the dungeons and general tanking, and is generally sociable and willing to make friends/dungeon buddies.
---
There are a lot of people who can't get enough of vanilla dungeons, a lot of them will be people who are various levels of hardcore and plan on raiding at 60.  I fell into the casual-hardcore lot, playing a couple nights a week.
---
I never usually had trouble finding groups, and because I was always tanking I ended up growing a long friends list of players who were always up for dungeons.  By level 30 or so, I was pretty much wearing his gear for my level minus a few pieces that weren't enchanted, I already had enough for my mount and had plenty to spare on enchants and potions.  I never bothered will other consumables, but people would often give me food and elixirs at the start of a run.  Being well-geared and enchanted, with a friends list full of great healers (and a few absolutely outstanding rogues.  Absolute monsters), it meant I could always move on to the 'next dungeon' before the mobs in my current grind went green and xp per time dropped off.  My best I think was killing Eranikus in Sunken Temple at level 46.
---
And that continued into the 50's, and I could start farming my preraid bis while finishing my way to 60.  I also had loads of money, just auctioning anything and everything valuable that dropped in the dungeons.  Like I was able to buy all the boe bus pieces (skipped enchanted thorium though) and belt/bracers of might before 60.
---
So basically I hit level 60 pretty much ready to raid, I spent maybe 1 day played getting a few last pieces (drakkisath shield was one I remember) before jumping in as an OT for a casual raiding guild.
---
I would argue that given how slow warrior leveling is regardless, the extra 5 or so days /played was well spent for someone who planned on raiding.  And I had a ton of fun doing it, I plan to start that way again when classic hits.  Build a reputation as a competent tank from the start.  A lot of my friends list outleveled me on my road to 60, and I'd often get whispers saying they wish I would catch up because the guy tanking their current run is a total chucklefuck or whatever.  And so once I hit 60 plenty of them were already raiding and I had no trouble finding a guild.
---
That's my two cents anyways.  I'd say go for it.
---
I am single but got a 9-5 job. My plan is to get home from work (do a bit of shopping before too), eat dinner, take a bath (throw in the laundry if necessary). I usually finish all these around 7 ish, then I can still game until 10-11. Repeat. If something is really important I can do it until 12, it's enough for me to get up at 7:20 ish since work is very close.
---
Rank 14 will be pretty much impossible like this but if I nolife weekends Rank 10 might be possible.
---
If you want to maintank it would depend on the guild you choose. Expect to be the one putting in the most effort among the tanks and being reliable, there for every raid as well as helping out with dungeons etc. Every guild needs a couple of tanks so I don't think you have to worry honestly
---
goblins/demonhunters were discussed prior to vanilla launch.  Demonhunters were ruled out due to limitations and reasoning that if you wanted to be a demonhunter just roll "nightelf warrior"  This is the legit thought process from the devs back then on demonhunter.
---
Uldum/hyjal/emerald dream/pirates/naga content and playable race
---
all of this and more was discussed around conception and was etiher pushed back due to limitations or time vs cost.  Most of them being limitations at the time.  Since most of it was pushed back or off the table due to limitations this is where expansion comes in and helps levitate limitations.
---
Expansions were inevitable if they wanted to add content back then.  Making the game a total joke though was all their own doing and you can't really blame "expansion" for that.  Devs just did too much bad things in the name of progress.
---
you just reminded me that i had the wow z-board!  That was years ago though
---
/2 guys where do i go for mankirks wife??
---
If you’re not a shitty tank and have free time, it’s very easy in fact. 
---
A pretty popular place: Tyr's hand. As a hunter turning off your brain and farming these guys felt relaxing. Sure, I could make gold much faster in Maraudon or even in DM, but theres something incredibly soothing about being out in the world and easily dispatching elite mobs. Sometimes youd get jumped by a rogue or mage and it would be awesome to pvp occasionally aswell (given that I always had my engineering trinkets on while farming).
---
I'll take 2 weeks vacation on release to get the leveling done and to just have a good time with all the streams, hype and stuff. After that I will just play after work for some hours and should be fine to start raiding. Rank 14 Grind is not realistic with a fulltime job.
---
I don't think there will be "wrong servers" besides the ones with big streamers on it (ye, don't fanboy just avoid them - u will have a bad time with queues and stuff). Hopefully they will post a list of server-names beforehand to plan with friends where to go.
---
I was thinking more like /1 LFM DPS VC

There are guides out there showing how to do 5min pummeler run so 25min for reset cap

I don't really work 9-5 (I just need to make 8h on work, the time isn't specified), playing for ~3h per day, so I can have some time for me too. Average I need 8d played which is 8*24=192h /3 = 64d till I hit 60... :D 
---
Yeah, no shit. They don't look like they just came out of the oven.
---
I do intend to be a warrior. Wife will be a healing priest. I have no issues with learning encounters. I also plan to work on preparing several things. 
---
I already am a tank in my guild on retail, i already run most of my guild through weekly +10-12 keys.
---
Being there and tanking is what I enjoy. I dont get burnt out. The issue im worried about is only 2.5% of raiders get to be the maintank.
---
As for leveling, i'd likely play 12 hours a days 5 days a week ( still have retail responsibilities) I will be active. I quite enjoy the challenge. I'm just worried about finding a place for myself.
---
Oh shit I /2'd, I'm banning myself from classic, I'll see myself out.
---
The /sit macro is a private server quirk that simply hasn't been fixed. It won't work in Classic and didn't work in retail either (at least not for long).
---
The most important thing is to not let people know your wife is in the guild if you manage to get that MT spot.
---
To me it is more like westfall
---
Nightelf. Just chill out somewhere in the forest and eat gooey spider cakes.
---
zep to grom gol and then flying is faster.
---
Devs wanted to put demonhunter in classic. They settled on the idea that you could roll night elf warrior.
---
So with their old thoughts in mind I have to say night elf warrior lol.
---
how does it compare to the later items that had feral attack power?
---
Depends on the instance. But it really comes down to the amount of quests available. Uldaman for example has a ton of quests for alliance and is pretty popular in guides for around level 40-45. Zul'Farrak is another instance with a bunch of quests.
---
Other than that, the only good reason to do instances is for weapons since these can greatly improve your xp/hour while questing. Especially as melee where some of the deadmines weapons will last you until you're in your 30s. 
---
This also applies to priests who use their wands a lot while optimally leveling. Though there are quite a lot decent wand rewards in the world so it's less of an issue than melee. Worth checking out a priest guide for recommended dungeon loot though.
---
Most people here will say it isn't worth it in terms of /played.
---
Let me tell you: It is *definitely* slower. Noticeably, were talking about +30%/40% time spent /played until 60 for sure compared to non-speed levelers.
---
The people who claim that it is like 2x as long think in terms of inefficient dungeon clears, because that is what you get 90% of the time, since people are all specced/geared for leveling and PUGs are dangerous, you might get ppl who are semi-afk, you might get ppl who don't know the mechanics or do other stupid shit.
---
*But* if you have people who are dedicated to dungeon leveling, with an actual tank, healer and some good CC from your DPS, with the proper speccs and gearing for dungeons, then you can pull much faster and much more fluently. You just run from pack to pack without a lot of breaks or even wipes, especially if you use VOIP.
---
Now the important thing is to not 100% tunnelvision on instance leveling *just in instances*. You should always travel to the next instance region a few levels before you can actually do it (if possible, some instances are super close together in terms of range) and then do some of the group efficient quests and pre-req quests for the dungeon you are doing next. You want to be doing this with people that are likeminded or find them on your server, so you can do a couple of clears back to back (depending on the instance).
---
Also you don't need 5 people to clear most dungeons in every gear/level situation. If you are *barely* at the level/gear for a dungeon then you do, but at some point you can just walk over it with just 3-4 ppl. Some dungeons you can even farm with just 2 ppl, like SM GY is one that you encounter early on, which can be done like that, and it is fast as hell so you'll do like 10 runs in an evening with your buddy.
---
The big plus of all of this: You'll find out sooner who you want to spend 60+ time with, you will have more gold overall when you hit 60 because dungeons give you more, better stuff. Also you will be more tuned to tricky mechanics and group PvE than most people.
---
Downside? Well, you'll do a lot less world PvP which is a bummer. Certain professions also require you to travel the actual world, so there is that. And ofc you'll be slower.
---
reminds me of when asking for portal in a raid I get everyone stacked.. portal roulette
---
Thousand needles next!
---
I can hear the Chuck Norris Jokes in the background 
---
It’s a place of seventy virgins u go to when your char dies
---
Just do what mages do and drink at every opportunity.
---
Why though? Are people afraid of favouritism?
---
I will be able to take 2 weeks as well...problem is I have to submit my request until the end of May and if we get no release date before then I am pretty much fucked :(.
---
dude I have the exact same schedule. It sucks
---
That sucks, let's hope they will give us a release date until may. I'm lucky in that regard and can take vacation on a like 1 week note without any problems if there is nothing special coming up.
---
The only reason people do threads such as OP is that they are fuckin' scared by all that bullshit minmaxers elitists vocal minority like you are spreading on this subreddit. That's exactly why I'm telling you to stop doing that, because that's useless.
---
It helps no one. It's a game and you are just forcing everyone to see it as a job, and threaten people that they won't be able to do end game content if they don't see it that way, **although it's completely false, because of the examples I stated**.
---
When I say "We don't care", it's about your minmaxer elitists statements. LEAVE US ALONE. Thanks.
---
This would be incredibly useful and I’ve always wanted an add on for this
---
Yeah, I can take 2-3 days on 1 week notice but not the long ones sadly. 
---
Hopefully we get some news. If not, I will gamble and book it according to the  July 16 easter egg we got.
---
Karazhan, Missing Diplomat questline extension, etc. Stuff they didn't get around to in Vanilla but wouldn't be obviously expansion level.
---
Yea, distributing gear among 40 people can be hard, if your wife manages to get gear before some people, they might think shes getting favouritism cuz ur the MT, causing drama.
---
I thought this was a Unreal Engine rendition at first, tho not dissapointed lol
---
I have several emails from Blizzard, they all have correct grammar.
---
Is this a weak troll attempt?
---
I think 16 slot debuff wouldn't be too terrible. DM on the other hand would be awful.
---
Insert Chuck norris jokes.
---
Gear should go to person that benefits the raid the most. 
---
Im savage af. 0 favouritism. Anyone who knows us, we prefer gear going to biggest raid increase. Who tf would steer gear towards one person... At the cost of the entire raid. Sounds toxic af.
---
I hope you don't mind me coming at you with a follow up question, since I dont want to create an extra topic just for a "help me choose my class" kinda question. 
---
I have been heavily undecided between warrior and rogue and was wondering if you could maybe provide some input on your feelings on warrior aswell. (If you haven't played one thats totally fine ... just what you think they are like compared to rogue from your perspective would be awesome). 
---
Do you understand abstractions and metaphors? Does your brain understand the concept of "same shit in different package"?
---
Yikes. Did a gnome steal your green girl?
---
I recall a lot of low level WPvP happening on that very border, around those horde quest givers. Good memories!
---
Yes, that's why i commented before. Rererencing real world stuff as an argument in fantasy game is stupid as fuck. You seem to have problems understanding what you read. You should concentrate on that instead or having shit in the package.
---
i honestly prefer loot council or main spec &gt; offspec unregulated DKP (either go full "we need to kill XYZ bosses soon" or full capitalism). i think epgp is unnecessary and annoying
---
dkp, id suppose, is much more popular for a few reasons:
---
1) a LOT of items desired from vanilla raiding have no real place in pve. however, these items are generally rare enough or behind so many bosses that many people want to specifically try to set themselves up for it at the cost of willingly foregoing other raid drops and being the last to receive upgrades. theyre OP for pvp, huge status symbols, or just items people are enamored with for the unwritten hivemind reasons. for example: eye of sulfuras, ashkandi (bonereavers is a better 2h pve sword so dont start), dark edge, corrupted ashbringer, might of menethil, paladin t2, shaman t2.5...
---
2) it rewards players who have the highest rate of attendance over the longest period. one may think "but youre raiding with 40 people so its fine if someone misses", but the truth of the matter is that youre going to want your better players to stick around as much as possible. even if theres 39 others, you more often than not will feel their absence. it has much to do with the class structuring and synergy of classes in vanilla - god forbid theyre also a high output healer or dps
---
3) there is a certain functional beauty in the chaos of dkp. the class cliques that naturally form truly come to life when something like nelths tear or something drops for the first time. while it might be interpreted as drama, its important to understand that these interactions are also what build up the culture of a guild (and to a lesser extent the culture of a server). everybody will remember the first time a big item dropped. everybody will remember who was bidding on it and any banter that surrounds it. its one of those reasons why guilds in vanilla generally feel more real than retail. retail guilds feel like 20 npcs where nobody is memorable...
---
The only good part is I get differential pay from 10 to 12 and there is no traffic coming in to work or leaving. 
---
Yes, mechanics are a lot harder. But they do not matter at all as the challenge and interest is never in the mechanics but competing against other people for world first or record time. You have to be mentally retarded to be challenged but scripted npc at face value.
---
What spec are you running? Are you spamming your shapeshifts? (maybe less bear, more travel form out of danger?)
---
In europe you sometimes have to watch out for servers that are adopted by players from a country with an unsupported language, that want to play in their own (small) language. 
---
My biggest problem is getting my two friend groups to join the same server. Got some friends from work who wish to play with me and a group from outside of work. These two groups dont know eachother.
---
I agree with you. Sure there are reasons for the horde to have young (not-so-finished) capitals but I still prefer the alliance buildings better. Scratches my liking of a fantasy setting.
---
Only horde place I can stand/like is undead ones. The rest are a collection of huts and hovels that do not inspire me in any way.
---
Don't forget grim batol
---
its ULTRA SLOW
---
definitely do the dungeons when you have the quests, as they become worth the time in terms of exp. the possible loot is an added bonus. however, dont let efficiency ruin your fun. if you have a great time in a certain dungeon and want to farm it a bit, do so
---
a certain moment in leveling warrior comes to mind. if youre a warrior and you want to farm scarlet monastery armory when youre at the appropriate level for the chance to get that 1% crit helmet and the ravager axe because you want to feel what the derpy proc on it feels like, do it. it might not be worth the in game experience, but it might be worth the experience of the game
---
Playing WoW on a schedule? No I don't have a gaming addiction so I should be able to manage. 
---
I guess my comment was just an useless case of trying to explain colors to colorblind. Oops I guess that again will be impossible to understand to you and you are wondering what colors have to do with anything.
---
Authenticating...
---
If you are serious about tanking, I suggest talking to potential guilds that could be recruiting and discussing if they had a spot for you. MT is usually only 1 so securing your spot early is pretty crucial. It all comes down to how much time you can put in and how dedicated you are planning to be, and you have to find a guild accordingly. For example dont apply to hardcore guilds if you want to play 2 hours a day
---
mAGE
---
lock has similar issues to hunter
---
all that micro isnt good
---
Do you have to be an engineer?
---
he said dps not lolret
---
That depends on your level and how many runs are you able to do.
---
Clearly, it is going to be much slower, even if you manage to run 4 dungeons / day and you are 2 levels bellow median dungeon boss lvl.
---
However, there are a number of advantages, that on the long run (and Classic is going to be a LONG RUN) are extremely beneficial.
---
First, you are going to make a lot of friends. Secondly, you are going to get the best gear that you can get during leveling, and that will absolutely help you in questing, because you HAVE to do questing as well (class quests, pre-quests for inside dungeon quests, attunement quests).
---
Thirdly, because you will play with a lot of people, you will know exactly what kind of guild you are best suited for. And this is damn important, again, on the long run.
---
Fourthly, you will make quite a lot of gold, that will ease your expenses with mounts and consumable.
---
As being a fun alternative, it is. Absolutely the most fun way to level.
---
I almost exclusively level in dungeons in Vanilla, being specced prot since lvl 30, which ment a very slow questing/grinding. I was also playing around 8 hours/day.
---
It took me 51 days to hit lvl 60. So that is around 400 hrs / played.
---
So...it's about TWICE as slow, but man, it's damn fun and you make a good name on the realm.
---
it doesnt. the actual feral weapons are vastly better
---
most of the damage of a cat druid comes from abilities, not autoattacks. why people insist on using MCP on cat druids is beyond comprehension. you dont have any other haste to synergize with, you benefit from windfury secondary hits, blah blah blah. additionally, once you get enough attack power, the combo point does several hundred dps on its own power and outperforms the debuff usage of warlock corruptions. it, like everything else a druid has, scales off of attack power
---
one other thing: feral druids have the highest stat scalings of every class in game for a reason. have you ever seen the insane disparity between a feral druids attack power and a warriors? 2.4:1 str scaling compared to 2:1. extra attack power baked into talents. weapons that individually provide several hundred attack power. its meant to be abused, and this disparity is even more obvious once the coefficients from kings and hakkar come into play
---
its also a great moneymaker
---
Currently at a private server, going on 5th reset on AQ40 i spend about 4 hours in raids on my main, additionally maybe a hour getting world buffs. So major part of my gaming is actually now playing on alts or related to grinding gold for consumables (well, you GAIN gold by raiding, im thinking you get 75-100g from boss drops and maybe spend like 30-40g on consumables in AQ per week).
---
The hardest part by FAR is the levelup. You want to get to max level fast and getting that pre-bis gear. After you get into raiding, the schedule becomes a LOT easier. Hopefully i can match my summer holiday to the release.
---
Thanks. I have a fair bit of raid leading experience. Perhaps i'll go through the pain of building my own. Maybe not. Who knows.
---
Ill start checking it out in a couple months.
---
raiding is perfectly doable with a 9-5 job.   2 nights a week for a casual guild, 19:00-23:00 (some start at 20:00)  A slightly more ambitious guild can add a 3rd or 4th raid night.
---
PVP can also be done, including being part of a premade ranking team, but you won't hit rank 14.    Rank 10  or 11 is more realistic 
---
Considering you are planning to play hardcore, I would 100% suggest to roll a rogue out of those 3. Simply because rogue will enable you the most to the best results and success. Top classes like warrior, rogue or mage are insane in the hands of a capable player and you can see a good performance from them much better than on druid for example. You will love the class when you get to 60 and get some gear. 
---
Also, the leveling experience with rogue is not that bad, I actually found it pretty fine. And sure, there are lots of rogues but lots of them actually get accepted to raids. For comparison, there is usually similar number of hunters and rogues on vanilla servers, but rogues have pretty much 2x more raid spots than hunters. Only weakness will he farming your pre bis gear from 5-mans as you will have a lot of competition from warriors and hunters, but with enough time put in, it wont be that bad. 
---
Either way, I would suggest warrior/rogue/mage/(warlock to some extent) to any other hardcore player out there, because those classes shine the most when played by a good player.
---
With some solo questing to pace it out it could be a fun aternative, certainly. Especially for a gear-dependent class. Just be under no illusions: it's not fast.
---
Where’s Chuck Norris? Photo obviously shopped 
---
I find most of the Alliance zones extremely boring. The few I can tolerate are Loch Modan and Westfall (and maybe Wetlands). My main problem with them is that they feel too "established" thematically, which removes a lot of the sense of adventure compared to the Horde's more hostile environment.
---
Also, the Barrens has plenty of variety for the people who complain about it, especially in regards to mobs. Way more than just "farm or cave" zones.
---
Be social as fuck and network, straight from leveling and leveling dungeons, and leveling guilds, and talk about planning to be main tank and position yourself like that. find ppl interested in future raiding. either be one of the founders of the guild, or join just newly forming guild (thats why you network so ppl know you up to be a maintank and have you in mind), or found your own guild. or leveling/social guild that doesnt raid yet.
---
Cos noone really founds a raiding guild without a reliable mt in mind, so chances of you just joining some already raiding guild as mt is really low, they more than likely already have a mt.
---
Although I prefer other zones, I do love how the icy mountains of Dun Morogh melt into the rivers of loch modan and wetlands. It's a neat touch.
---
Well, it is a path what you should walk for your own, so this means nothing,
---
However 
---
Im a rogue until the end of time + feral/warrior was enjoyable too (warrior with harmstring kite is more than fine, even with trash gear)
---
Playing between 30 minutes and 2 hours a day. It's unlikely that I'll raid, but I'm fine with that.
---
Yes, you are very useless.
---
Karazhan :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SX-9kA8hQUk&amp;t=0 
---
They were already working on it + Atiesh TP is for something :)
---
But we're bot getting two games. We're getting back the game that we already paid for that blizzard took away. I already paid the advertised box price and sub fee fifteen years ago.
---
Handshaking...
---
Also fraps
---
That is if the server structure Blizzard is making Classic on will actually allow this, since it's based on a Legion patch.
---
You can't do this in current WoW atm.
---
No, they lost their entire database from pre cata. 
---
"amazing"
---
You don't find MT slots, you build them.  
---
Either from the ground up with the guild or by being the best guy for the job if the MT quits.
---
I mean, helping an elderly by simply passing over his book is a rather poor example.
---
Honest question: How have you got a T3 geared Druid and not learnt how to manage mana?
---
Timbermaw hold was a planned raid and/or dungeon. The instance portal even exists in aszhara. Same thing with a cancelled stormwind dungeon (not Stockades).
---
This could be the route from the Dry Gulch Ravine in North-West Barrens down south to Lushwater Oasis (correct?) - passing the Prowlers and Raptors - so that would put Stone Talon Mountains just behind those mountains.
---
It was the first raid ever worked on, and evidently there seemed to be some intention of bringing it into the fold after Naxx given the Atiseh Greatstaffs ability. My guess is at some point they decided that there would be a new expansion and they'd roll it into that instead of pushing for a Vanilla release.
---
TL;DR for those confused - OP is asking for Zboard game profiles because they official servers have been shutdown and there are none available.
---
If you have old Zboard game profiles please upload them.
---
Orcs are like migratory tribes. Durotar reminded them of home. They wanted to retain their culture and traditions so they settled there.
---
&gt;But if you have people who are dedicated to dungeon leveling, with an actual tank, healer and some good CC from your DPS, with the proper speccs and gearing for dungeons, then you can pull much faster and much more fluently. 
---
So much this. I've done 4 separate uldaman runs recently, both as tank, healer or dps, and run times were staggeringly different. In my last run, although we wiped onces, we were really fast, because the priest had to only stop once or twice to drink, since me hotting myself between pulls was enough and we had solid dps.
---
Grand Canyon? 
---
This looks juat like the area with the Silithids in Southern Barrens
---
&gt;Unlike retail, there is a HUGE GAP between the mobs at the entrance and the final part of the dungeon.
---
To give an example: Uldaman's entrance mob consists of dwarfs of about level 36. At the end of the dungeon you will battle hard-hitting golems and troggs of level 45. The end boss is level 47 and hits like a truck. So as a 46 beartank I could breeze through the first half with the healer literally just wanding all the way. Then BAM, in just 2 corners I've turned super squishy and the healer was constantly drinking between pulls.
---
Thanks for the writeup my dude. I am interesting in going druid in vanilla, although not cat specifically but I'd like to retain the ability to hybridise where available :]
---
I don't think you'd want to exclusively level in dungeons, but you can easily farm them for all the gear and get most of your levels that way. Sure it is slower, but classic won't go anywhere.
---
Why would getting high interfere with raiding? WoW is the perfect stoner game, I raided Mythic in Legion and was smoking every night no problem.
---
With only a 9-5 job you can easily play an hour or two every day, and that is more than enough to be just as good as any try-hard.
---
I plan on going hard in the summer (hopefully classic gets released then) then I will simply only play in the weekend afternoons because I'll have other activities on weekdays. Now this will be actually too slow, but I'm hoping that the content patches will come slowly.
---
It's not addiction, it's having reasonable goals and plans for your life. Pointless to hype yourself up if you know you won't have the time to progress in a pace you want.
---
Hunters are a lot of fun. I mained a Hunter throughout vanilla and beyond. They have a very high skill ceiling (there's a lot to learn to be a great Hunter) and a very low skill floor (you can get by as a bad hunter, but also means you can mindlessly grind as a semi-AFK watching-a-movie hunter).
---
A really good Hunter should be a valued member of any good guild.
---
For me, the only downside of Hunter was being a pure DPS class meant long waits trying to find spots in PUGs. Getting a good guild or good server rep can alleviate that. In Classic I'm going to play a class that can tank and/or heal, because I will be fairly time poor and can't afford hours sat in cities on LFG.
---
only for 2 hours? I get .95c all day just for working 2nd/3rd at my job and people here still complain lol.
---
I love Wailing Cavenrs as much as the next guy, but after doing it 10 times in a row I think you will find questing as a very attractive alternative.
---
Vanilla is even better, since raids are much easier and simpler.
---
Get to 60 before all the other warriors, be the only available tank for the other neckbeards and make connections, that's my plan at least.
---
Lootdisturbution should be dictated by lootcouncil and it wouldnt make sense to have the MT influencing decitions of the healer council.
---
That or DKP.
---
That would depend on your definition of easy. Being MT is the hardest and most demanding role you can have in a guild in vanilla.
---
Thanks :) I'm not much of a writer. I guess this was an exception, as it was genuine emotions.
---
Again, I'am not an elitist. I don't consider myself a hardcore raider. I'am a filthy casual who raided back in the day with filthy casual guilds. I never, ever said to anyone what they should do, just stating what I have *seen and experienced* and my thoughts on that. And let me tell you: Guild drama sucks, and it almost always stems from not progressing and not getting rewarded. I'am the last one who tells others what to do or what they can play/spec and the first one who is willing to try out things. It's a game after all.
---
But at the end of the day a Guild is a social community, it is give and take. You are part of a bigger thing, which is exciting and rewarding. The ideal is that everyone is trying their best to have fun and to progress through content. Threads like this one smell of people who are just about themselves. They want to do the special thing for themselves, not because they are convinced that it is better for the Guild. It's always excuses like "this disadvantage isn't as big as you think" instead of actual reasons like "this is helping my guild in a way this other thing can't".
---
You don't need pre-bis gear to raid. If 10-20 people have it, the rest can cruise off with greens easily. Some classes need gear more than others.
---
This. I can go about 4 days in a row max on 4.5 hours before I'm forced to take a long sleep night. 
---
Back in 2006, after a night of raiding our guild decided to go for some PVP. Thing is we managed to get a full group of paladins and sign up!
---
Hilarity ensued, it was impossible for any of us to die, be stopped or otherwise fail. So we won easily the games we played, and here is a video comprising of clips from the first game as I remember it.
---
Surely it would be more profitable for them to Split the subscriptions to Classic and Retail, then add a bundle if you want both.
---
If they increased the cost, they’d most likely lose a lot of people off retail who weren’t willing to play and don’t want classic.
---
Most people who want classic don’t play retail so wouldn’t mind it being separate. Most of those who want to play both will realise its 2 games so will pay more.
---
Seems odd they ruled this out, anybody any insight into why?
---
&gt;I'd buy that in a game with a higher skill ceiling, But in vanilla WoW raiding, a lot of people are literally hitting one button. They are going to do the same damage mashing frostbolt as a scrub in the same gear because there is no magic high-skill way to super-mash that key and get more DPS.
---
There's still a lot of things that you can do wrong. Incorrect itemization and talents, decreased DPS uptime due to bad positioning, wasting time to evocate/life tap instead of using pots and runes... And then there's classes that do depend on doing the right rotation such as hunter and rogue. Raid composition also matters, bringing several arms warriors will decrease raid DPS by a significant amount.
---
&gt;I apologise - I got you mixed up with Tardigrade89 and you have indeed been perfectly civil.
---
No problem :)
---
&gt;I think it's human nature that a lot of people don't do better than "good enough", and the boss fell down therefore to them it was good enough.
---
Yes, but the definition of "good enough" plays changes based on what gear you're working with. I'm sure that the best retail Vanilla guilds would've pushed harder and completed the instance even if it were more difficult, but the fact is that it could be completed even with sloppy plays and preparation.
---
&gt;Fails gonna fail, I guess.
---
Yeah! While serious pirate server guilds have great players, casual guilds still struggle with the kind of people who think that "you're the bomb" is a compliment, not a warning.
---
&gt;Consensus seems to be that threat mattered a lot in early raiding and everyone had to be careful not to overtake the tank, and that by 1.12 fury warriors with no threat mitigation or aggro dump could go nuts for an entire fight without any aggro worries.
---
As I already said, it just doesn't seem to me like the guy in the video is anywhere close to threat capping. 1.12 fury warriors rely on stuff like the tank having a TF and gearing for TPS.
---
Overall, I agree that patch progression made the players stronger, but I don't think that the difference is all that large in 40-man PvE (PvP is a different matter, CC and quick bursts were busted). Overall, I don't think that Ragnaros will fall during the first week, but I'd wager that the first full MC clear will happen between 10 and 14 days after release. I also think that in the same environment as during the world first Ragnaros kill (patch 1.4), some of the current guilds could kill him within the first two or three weeks.
---
Why not be OT? I plan on becoming a feral druid and be OT in raids. Much easier than being a warrior MT. Less gear-dependence, less pressure...
---

&gt; I doubt anyone has theorycrafted a dungeon-only leveling route, 
---
Not so fast buddy!

8/12/31
---
and probably am spamming travel more then i should?
---
retrowow
---
i can manage mana in raids.....
---
no feral charge? ouch
---
Okay so I've actually done this and it's not as slow as people believe it is. But there are a few things to consider, first of all if you want to do this efficiently you NEED to have at least a healer friend together with a dps that are good and in on it so you can spam dungeons without spending 1 hour looking for a group every time you log in. And you should always do every single quest there is for that dungeon as those together can give you a full level on turn in. Make sure you log out inside an inn every night and prepare yourself for some repetitive grinding  as you will be doing some dungeons 10 times. You do this and some elite quests in the open world together with your friends on rare occasions (like the hinterlands ones and arathi highlands) and it isn't slow at all,  we weren't too far behind the ones who were doing questing only. 
---
I understand. I'm just trying to get a base understanding of rogue/the game in general before the launch.
---
It does.
---
It may be a good idea to try to find a guild before the game is out. You can also use the fact that your wife is a healer as leverage.
---
If you don't suck and you never miss a raid day you'll have zero issues being a MT.
---
A lot of people either forgot the Vanilla launch experience of haven't played on fresh pservers.
---
The real 300 IQ knowledge is that all the "routes","guides", and popular quests will be *extremely congested* and picking up a few quests for a dungeon and doing a quick run can often be a good idea and far better than hitting your head against a wall in Searing Gorge getting ganked by 17 different rogues while trying to fight over spider quest mobs.
---
&gt; it doesnt. the actual feral weapons are vastly better
---
Pretty sure you just equip the manual pummeler at the start of the boss fight to use the skill and then you swap to your regular weapon
---
That's because you're getting carried by people who farm pre-bis. 
---
My post was about doing dungeons in questing greens. 
---
Pretty much everyone go oom in both pvp and pve(pal being the exception), that's just how the game is.
---
You have to manage your mana, drink or die when you're out, that the very foundation of what classic is.
---
Succes!
---
success+
---
Everyone that fell for the prank and got ported to Darn = *right click reported.*
---
A couple of BGs, easily 20+ reports, **automated ban.**
---
Then you have to make an appeal, get a copy paste response, appeal again, and then finally get the ban lifted(?). At that point the damage is already done.
---
Vanilla WoW was a social experience. Some people have reputations as great tanks, some as ninjas, and some tricksters. You can't be a bad guy anymore to face the consequences.
---
Instead you'll be punished by an automated Activision Blizzard system.
---
Right click report is absolutely one of the biggest daggers in the back of "Classic" WoW killing the true Vanilla game.
---
Karazhan and Caverns of time, these zones were already half done during vanilla
---
Shit dawg, I was just playing
---
You have 0 worries,less than 0. To the extent this whole postie pointless. I promise you'll be fine.
---
Only a 3rd started during Vanilla?
---
No wonder this sub is foaming at the mouth to get flying mount LFG expansions like TBC and WotLK which will invalidate and obsolete virtually the entirety of the Vanilla content.
---
Gives me a glimmer of hope. Thank you.
---
I find it hard to believe there are so many Vanilla players and so little TBC and WotLK players. When the player base in Vanilla was much lower than both those expansions.
---
We'll just have to take our chances and hope that either we picked the right server or migration will be possible in time.
---

I dont remember any fresh "cycles" at the time Naxx was released. 
---
"No changes etc."
---
I'm playing on a pserver and I have alts in almost every reputable raiding guild (except the Russian ones. there aren't many big raiding guilds anyway).
---
I've literally never seen or heard of a single guild that uses anything other than loot council.
---
But you have to keep in mind that the pserver playerbase will be incredibly different than the Classic base. Pserver players are generally far more knowledgeable and goal oriented than the average Classic player will be.
---
EPGP incentivises people to only ever roll on absolute bis which means either you force people to pick up items they don't want, or disenchant a whole bunch of upgrades. Even with decay systems it's definitely suboptimal.
---
Dude 3 years is kinda young to date tbh
---
&gt;Go do a raid with everyone in questing greens without prep
---
That's not what I wrote at all.
---
If you cant beat them, insult them and downvote. I was correct and you were just plain wrong. Please do not embarass yourself further by playing the victim here. It's embarassing.
---
Nice, something to listen to today
---
OSRS requires a 75% majority for a vote to pass.
---
The main difference: If you are the tank you dictate the pace. If you are the healer, you follow the tanks pace.

&gt; Finally, raiding as DPS, go fury and don’t be afraid to use a dagger in the OH. Find the slowest dagger you can, and the fastest 1H for your Main, and watch your damage skyrocket. 
---
why the bell would you use the fastest possible mainhand if your whirlwind profits way more from slow weapons?
---
i saw some people talk about fast weapons being good for rage generation, which is complete nonsense if you look 1 second at the vanilla rage generation formula. but since you wrote like the warrior pve hero himself you ofc already knew that.
---
please share your insight with us.
---
Druid is a class that you can be specd for world PVP, win tons of 1v1/ 1v2, and still show up to raid heal. 
---
I know deranking healing touch in raids isn’t the epitome of exciting, but other healing and DPS rotations just quite aren’t that exciting in vanilla wow quite frankly. 
---
You can level feral and pretty much do anything in a dungeon if you keep a resto set. Tanking while you level as feral is super easy. 
---
But I still have to go back to my favorite part. Shapeshifting is the best in vanilla wow. You have stealth, travel form, aquatic form. Druids are THE most underrated world PvP class in the game 
---
That's the ones! :)
---
Idk, there were quite a few of these that made sense, like the necklace lost in redridge lake for example.
---
Yeah precisely my thought. While Westfall does have a lot of grind attributed to itself it's a pretty great zone lore-wise. And to jump from Westfall to Duskwood is just an incredible feeling. This spooky darkness that you're trying to eradicate. I don't see ANY horde zones giving a better feeling than Duskwood does.
---
It's long known and stated inside the dev diary that Horde Quests came later down the line. So while they started out with Alliance quests and they certainly learned to avoid some mistakes on the horde ones, overall the alliance walkthrough is much smoother and thematically way more interesting.
---
Proper RP in WoW is an entirely other world. It shouldn't be represented by Goldshire since it has almost nothing to do with it.
---
To some extent though this is because it's a starting zone. That's when they still thought they have enough time :) And They also started with the undead when it comes to the Horde zones, which is why the undead to human interaction is done so freaking well.
---
I think trying to leverage that will have the opposite of the desired effect.
---
Aaaand cue Barrens chat!

Oh you're a vegan. It all makes sense why you think you are so up your own ass because people misinterpreted your phrasing.
---
Instead of being humble and saying "I can see where you're confused, but what I meant by dropping target I meant by  If you target me, and I use shadowmeld. You will lose me as your target"
---
But no, you think that by not being clear in your phrasing you are right and other people are wrong and that gives you clear reign to be a complete and utter piece of human shit.

I've never worried about efficiency, every time I've leveled a tank I've ran every dungeon I could while leveling. I wouldn't do things like wc as alliance but I certainly made a few runs of everything easy to get too. I like the shiny gear upgrades and taking a break from questing. It's one thing I'll miss while leveling as dps.

Earliest comment is from Jan 2005, so it's pretty safe to assume it was ingame from the start.
---
If you're gonna spend at least a bit more time playing that the average player, you won't have any problems though.
---
Funny how this is getting downvoted, but ActiBlizz is just a business and they don't do ANYTHING without money in mind.
---
Who says that I"m pushing for anything? Blizzard will get theirs, either way.
---
How does Durotar remind them of home when they lived in an almost arctic environment ? Most of the orcs that accompanied Thrall were from the frostwolf clan, which come from frostfire ridge. They'd be more at home in winterspring. They settled in Durotar because there was noone to stop them from doing so.
---
You can ignore all this hardcore metagame theorycrafting stuff online. People didn't use cheesy trinkets and lvl20 maces for max hardcore clear-times back in the day.
---
Fights were completed without a fraction of the knowledge today just by getting basics right like letting the tank gain threat and watching your threat meter.
---
Not to say you can't do all these fancy tricks if you really want to, but practically all the content can and will be cleared by simple bread and butter raiding.

I want to see someone RP the Goldshire homeowner’s association trying to remove the red light district from the town.

I'am doing it right now as an experiment with 2 buddies. Currently we play Warrior, Priest, Druid. The warrior is mainly tanking, the druid is currently just feral but will likely spec hybrid, priest (me) is healing, currently going into disc to reach Divine Spirit quickly. It is going really well. We're not exclusively running dungeons but we do several clears and then prepare for the next one.
---
Things we noticed:
---
1. As soon as the Warrior gets some gear, especially a decent shield + 1h it is a walk in the park.
---
2. We get dungeon groups *really fucking fast*, in comparison to your solo toons, because we fill the hard to find spots ourselves.
---
3. Speccing into healing (so far disc on Priest) makes a huge difference in terms of how quickly you push through an instance. We play as fast and aggressive as we can.
---
4. Since we're reasonably experienced with this game (all played through vanilla and TBC) *and* have a druid who can fill in for tanking/offtanking and healing as well, we can easily do whole parts of dungeons with just 3 players decently quickly, which means more exp/player and no waiting time if someone leaves because of RL (actually happened to us).
---
5. So far it is decent in terms of /played because were not super tunnelvisioning on *only* dungeons. So far we cleared them about 3 times each and then progressed through some efficient quests and prereqs for dungeons quests.
---
6. We actually get good gold and tons of crafting/disenchanting materials.
---
7. We gear up more consistenly which makes the first run of subsequent dungeons easier. For example if you ran WC three times and got some of the rewards, you can run SFK much earlier w/o issues.
---
8. The *real* time sink is the scheduling since were 3 working adults.
---
9. We had some real bad luck with some of our groups so far, but we're still doing fine. By bad luck I mean people who semi afk, put DoTs on AoE mobs etc. (we have a direct comparison with our solo toons).
---
Conclusion so far:
---
It is quicker than we thought it would be since we're playing and speccing around eachother way better than your random PUG. We need to be a little more picky when it comes to briging randoms but that also has something to do with building a decent friends list and notiticing the right people in our leveling guild. It's really fun to do leveling dungeons, especially since we don't have to do the methodical slow style as PUGs usually have to, since we can trust eachother and do micro calls via VOIP.
---
Nothing left to do...we need something new...so come meet me at...2005
---
Doing instances is typically less than half the xp of just grinding mobs, much less questing.
---
the quest in Tarren Mill to bring turtle meat and hot spices to the guy who will sell you hot spices...
---
I'd recommend memorizing or printing out a list of emotes because those are used quite frequently in RP. Here is 1 such list: https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Emote.
---
You also have to learn to slow down while playing in a group. In WoW it is natural to rush through dungeons or just pull mobs back to back. But while RPing it is a slower pace and having conversation while grouping. For example, say you are killing dark mages that have taken over a nearby village. You could ask someone if they have seen your sister and describe your sister. Telling them how she lived in this village and you are looking for her, etc. You can create your own story.
---
Anyway, have fun. If you have a vivid imagination that helps. Also if you can type in an accent that works best for certain races, e.g. if you play a troll mage, look at the quest text for troll mage quest givers. Look at how they talk and try to mimic similar speech patterns. Also do research on how names work for that race. And spend time looking up lore on your class and race, e.g. how do troll magi get their power? Do they pray to a god? Where do they study? 
---
Man the mic quality is all over the place, but I still remember this period as the golden age for WoW machinimas.
---
That will drop the debuff. I agree with rodrigat, that any Feral AP Weapon &gt; MCP. 
---
Tactical ***dot***.
---
You can't afford (goldwise) to do what you intend to do leveling
---
Is there any new info at all in it
---
That's just over 2 hours, not so bad.
---
Loot council is like communism. Theory, awesome - reality? Not so much. Ends up being the gm’s gf in full bis, his best m8 gets raptor Mount and the mt he is trying to bribe gets dft.
---
&gt;Well yeah them making separate TBC servers is a given
---
As in Blizz will more than likely release TBC servers eventually? I don't think that's true. Releasing TBC wouldn't solve the fundamental problem that's causing this discussion in the first place, finite content, releasing it just delays the inevitable (population decline). The only way to theoretically stop that is with new content. 
---
Exactly. Just missing a few Rock Elementals to farm Elemental Earth.
---
Right, I never even considered this. Dungeons being instanced avoids alot of headaches that fresh server leveling has. People are really bold when it comes to solo grinding/questing. Mages blinking past you to tag a named quest mob because inviting you takes a couple of more seconds, people running past you to click on a mechanic, since you cleared the way for them etc. are all very common occurences and slow you down unpredictably for several minutes on your progression. Some named spawns can last as long as 10+ minutes.
---
Illegal Danish is my favourite WoW Machinima, but yep similar era haha.
---
&gt;So twink community is possibly not represented?
---
That's why I also said,
---
&gt; you must have played X amount of time in the last X weeks/days/months in order to be eligible to vote
---
But keep in mind, the whole purpose of this is to allow "actual" Classic players, people passionate about the game, have their voices heard IF new content would become a thing. If the fear of retail players coming in and sabotaging the voting system is real, then we need to gate keep somehow. 
---
Probably not 
---
You get really bad experience from mobs in dungeons, the only reason doing dungeons makes sense is for doing 5-ish dungeon quests and getting gear upgrades.
---
I would very much recommend that you quest and do every dungeon you see fit, if you have quests, then do them once, if you have potential weapons to get, then don't be shy to do 1-3 runs and try get the weapon. You are gonna have a lot more fun this way, and level way faster.
---
I remember really loving all these music videos that came out during the TBC-wotlk era. Illegal Danish was also fantastic of course
---
IMO I thought of 1000 needles first then read barrens ! Cool none the less 
---
The rock-face looks like badlands, the straw like grass does look like it needs 5 Lions sitting around it in Barrens.
---
This front won't be enough to ease people's fears. I'm telling you from experience that you're going to want to avoid being vocal about your relationship with her at least for awhile lol.
---
Guys, I have been grinding the raptors for days now and yet no stolen silver ??? WTF ..
---
Nah just some fun facts pretty much that we didn't know about. Ythisens still has to be very careful what he can/can't say about classic.
---
Uldua3, grim batol, karazhan, hyjal.
---
*tribal music begins*
---
IIRC Westfall was the very first zone they ever made, in the alpha version.
---
Care to explain? Just curious your point of view.
---
There is a *huge* difference in clearing dungeons with a dedicated group vs. PUGs in terms of speed, especially if you fill the "carry" roles in healing and tanking with the proper specs and gear, which makes a huge difference (I was actually surprised). You'll fill your group really fast and progress much faster than PUGs through them. Trash EXP isn't as bad as it sounds because dungeons are *packed* with mobs and you get a significant group EXP bonus from &gt;3 ppl on.
---
Another big thing is to not just do dungeons but also do some of the more efficient quests in an area while getting the prereq quests for the dungeons as well.
---
If you do leveling dungeons multiple times with the *right people* you won't even suffer that much if you fill the rest with keyboard turners and AFKers (actually exprienced this multiple times). You have to do far less openworld quests and especially grinding (since you grind dungeons duh), which means you can be much more picky.
---
I highly recommend ppl try this out, especially if you can put together a nice synergetic group.
---
**Two or Three Raid Days?**
---
I'm trying to pick a future guild and I noticed although they say they're "hardcore" guilds these guilds vary from having two raid nights and three raid nights.
---
In classic, are two raid nights enough to clear everything each week? Or should I look for a guild that has three raid nights for optimal clearing?
---
if it worked like that, itd be super OP but it doesnt :/
---
you lose the buff when you swap. also, if you really want to try to competitively use MCP, youd have to enchant every one you get and thats prohibitively expensive
---
What did you sacrifice in resto from a more standard 1 11 39 spec
---
Awful spec for pvp
---
This is why I travel. It's f\*cking beautiful to find gems like this. I live in EU and I find many WoW locations inspired by America's national parks, which I enjoy. Wanna Thousand Needles? Go to Bryce.
---
im going bear! i detest resto druid healing. besides, holy paladins are infinitely better druids. i enjoy playing cat as well, but bears just turn into absolute mountains that shrug everything off with hilarious threat generation for pvp. its simple, its fun, and people love being able to go all out without having to worry about overthreating their tank :D
---
None of those reasons really apply in vanilla. No resilience, SL doesn't scale well with spell dmg etc.
---
Same same but still, most of the time, in my guild at least the MT didn’t had to farm components. We put a guild tax to ensure that The MT was always be full buff and did not had to pay his huge repair fees. Healers did not have those privileges and farmed was hard for some classes.
---
It is a bit slower but not even close to a double rate. You cut out a lot of the questing inefficiencies such as traveling and filling your bags with quest items, drinking/eating, contesting mobs/mechanics with others etc.
---
Mc is 40 min, bwl is 40 min too. Aq40 is like 2.5 hours. Can't say anything about naxx. 
---
Stuff like ERP(basically old men jerking eachother off through night elf characters) isn't widespread at all in RP servers. Though if you look for it you'll find it(in Goldshire especially because Blizzard cba to purge that inn).
---
On a RP realm you'll find plenty of guilds with specific themes(military, adventure, guard, etc). Some of these will be considered 'hardcore', this means that they take RP seriously so OOC(out of character) joking/comments during RP isn't appreciated. These kind of guilds will often have multiple events a week.
---
There are also more casual guilds where they don't really care about your ability to RP(though in my experience people are really helpful no matter the guild).
---
I suggest to walk up to people who are RP'ing and just join in. You can also join a guild, most people will be happy to help newcomers.
---
Are you using private server speeds because in vanilla I’ve never heard of 40 min clear times. I was never in a topend guild but mc, zg, aq20 were all 2-3hours per. Even high guilds were like 1.5hr, I don’t see it dropping that much?
---
Maybe I’m wrong though
---
youre basically 100% guaranteed to get a MT spot if you:
---
0.5) have a microphone
---
1) dont miss raids
---
2) are willing to tank things:
---
     a) you do not need gear from
---
     b) you have no interest in tanking anymore
---
     c) at other people's whim because people in guild need things
---
3) always have an acceptable amount of consumables (which implies a lot of positive cash flow)
---
I used to be all over this stuff but re-watching it now...they were pretty bad lol. 
---
Abandonation is probably the only one that had decent flow. 
---
That said their creativeness with lyrics to match WOW and spoofing is pretty fun.
---
Raids are alot of outside prep work. You shouldn't have any real issue clearing stuff up to AQ in any guild. While it might only be a couple nights a week that you "raid" if your guild isn't doing the outside effort they are going to take longer to clear stuff
---
Using pservers as an example, good guilds will clear raids in a few hours if everyone has consumables and stuff ready for raid night (that's with pre-raid BiS gear). Raiding is extremely easy, farming is what takes time.
---
When your guild gets decently geared and used to the bosses, you will be able to clear both MC and BWL in 2 hours (one consumable duration). So yes, 2 nights are enough if the guild you join are actually decent players with a good raid leader that makes quick calls.
---
Not at all what RP has to offer. I'm a RPer on Argent Dawn EU, and Goldshire is a laughing stock here. I'd check out a RP server using a trial account if you're not subscribed, and install an RP addon and walk around Stormwind to see that most profiles don't mention their character's additional assets.
---
Of course as I'm speaking from an EU perspective, I have no idea if that'll actually be the case on Moon Guard or not.
---
To be honest, real hardcore guilds will only need a 1 raid day. You can clear the whole relevant content up to AQ under 4 hours. You only need more once Naxx hits.
---
2-3 days is typical for more casual guilds
---
One night to clear MC. When BWL comes out, also just one night to clear BWL+MC (same night), do zg whenever (was never really scheduled, typically ran after raid). Once AQ comes out I like doing 2 days.
---
It should be fairly obvious by now that this guy has some serious issues. Just for the record, I started WoW with the closed beta when I was 12 years old. Around Wotlk I started playing on my first private 1.12 server where I had attained 5/9 T3 (Vanilla Gaming, far from instant lvl 60). Later I played on Nost/K2 and then played on Retro-WoW for PvP only where I was in Perplexity's guild. 
---
Depends on the guild and what they’re clearing. Taking one night to clear MC/BWL/Ony and the other to clear AQ40 isn’t the same thing as taking a full night to clear BWL. 
---
Hardcore guilds having more raid nights can mean multiple things. They can have PTR practice nights, count ZG/ony offnights as their weekly raid nights (some do, some don’t) or simply be a “hardcore” guild that can’t even clear AQ40. 
---
&gt; I never, ever said to anyone what they should do, just stating what I have *seen and experienced* and my thoughts on that  \[...\]  I'am the last one who tells others what to do or what they can play/spec and the first one who is willing to try out things. **It's a game after all.** 
---
Ok then let me show how much your are lying by citing your comment on this thread only :
---
&gt;If you don't have much time then don't play feral dps druid in raids. It is probably the most farm intensive class to play if you want to keep up with DPS and actually contribute.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;resto druid in the other hand is not very farm nor gear dependand in comparison.  
---
&gt;If you really want to play a DPS in raids then why would you want to play one that is either objectively bad or incredibly time consuming?
---
And you are still ignoring the part of my comment that says that what you are doing is detrimental to people who just want to believe they can play anything in that game, because indeed, it is a game. What I'm citing of you in the following may be only an opinion in your point of view, **but again it scares the shit out of people and influences them, which is for the worst most of the time**. I have had answers of people to my comment to thank me that I reassure them because they really thought Vanilla/Classic is as restrictive as hardcore players always state, although it is NOT :
---
&gt;The problem?  
---
&gt;The problem is that people will quit one by one. The good ones will go first, then the raids will be even slower and then the rest will go.  
---
&gt;The longer and less stable your raids, the less people will have time to show up on every raid, so you will skip entire weeks, which makes people even more unhappy.  
---
&gt;Usually in vanilla guilds were "carried" by a dedicated core of people, who always showed up, farmed up, had the most efficient builds, and put out the biggest numbers. Yes there were suboptimal/meme builds and people with minimal consumables etc. But those players simply tagged along and benefited from others.  
---
&gt;If you have too many of those in a raid, the raid gets slow, wipes more and won't progress nearly as fast through content, which means less items for everyone.  
---
&gt;On top of that, if you do a hipster spec you will just not feel as useful. In TBC I played shadowpriest because my raid needed one, not because I wanted. We had a caster/destro warlock heavy composition, so we needed those debuffs and that mana. I find healing actually way more compelling than pressing 4 buttons repeatedly in a raid (or was it 5?) and chaining mana pots.  
---
&gt;So personally I just don't get why people want to play suboptimal *DPS* builds. Raid healers have a much more intricate role for the most part. And being bottom DPS despite farming the most for the raid is kind of meh isn't it? I almost never see talks about for example feral druid off-tanks, which *are* useful. It's always "I wanna raid with enh shaman / boomkin". Those requests leave me with a big question mark.
---
You keep trying to justify yourself, while I'm just saying, it won't bring you anything to spread your opinion here, however it will destroy other players genuine approach to the game. Just stop. Please.
---
after you read what people write, consider joining an instant 60 server or something so you can practice your rotations or whatever on dummies and do a few test drives in dungeons
---
however, i sort of think that with how long it takes to level in vanilla, youll learn to love whatever you play :) everything is good at something
---
It’s nice to hear Ythisens input on remaining questions and what he thinks blizzard won’t and will do because he knows the culture at blizz and has witnessed their track record.
---
I really want this to be true, but the dudes at classic druid discord have theorycrafted this tuff into oblivion, and they say MCP so what’s going on here?
---
People are optimizing and min/maxing the shit out of vanilla more than they ever did before. It’s why you see crazy shit like 90 minute Naxx clears. It also doesn’t help that the timers are counted from first boss engaged to last boss killed (mainly a factor in MC speedruns more than other raids). 
---
You're right, I mixed upwow's orcs with another game's. Ahahah
---
For more casual guilds?
---
There needs to be a Alliance equivalent 
---
Yeah:-/
---
Why does the James guide talk about a level 30 mount?
---
I don't believe troll racial does take a global, but overall the list is solid.
---
I can't believe they started working on it so early, that's incredible!!!!
---
I already took this into consideration. Everyone is going to be using the most popular guides, therefore those routes will be even more time consuming than usual. In that respect it's probably better to go off the beaten track.
---
In vanilla, blood fury does not add sp.
---
troll shaman
---
kodo graveyard, desolace
---
so i can be nice to the kodo in their last hours that have so doggedly marched across the continent to join their ancestors
---
But you gotta stretch it out to 10 minutes for that sweet sweet ad revenue.
---
/s
---
fuck off I block your ads anyway
---
Only need a few servers = they thought they would have a small population of a few thousand players. That has nothing to do with business models nor did I suggest it. Don't put words in my mouth.
---
This was all before launch in an interview with one of the devs. Internally they didn't think the game would catch on.
---
TBC guide. 
---
considering you cant even carry enough mcps in your bags to have 100% uptime on all bosses for the night...
---
That warm fuzzy feeling of showing up and turning the tides, and having the one token shaman or priest on your team start pocket healing you as you break the inevitable alliance 9 man base defense turtle.
---
Good times.
---
The more hardcore the guild, the less guild nights it needs.
---
No
---
You are heavily reading stuff into my comments now. Strike that picture you made of who I am and actually *read* what is there.
---
&gt; Ok then let me show how much your are lying by citing your comment on this thread only
---
In the comment you quoted I just stated two facts (feral dps being very farm depenand and resto druids not being as farm dependand) and I asked a suggestive question. I asked this question because I'am really curious about the intentions of OP because she/he was all over the place with their issues ("I don't have much time" and "I want to play feral dps in raids").
---
&gt; You keep trying to justify yourself, while I'm just saying, it won't bring you anything to spread your opinion here, however it will destroy other players genuine approach to the game. Just stop. Please.
---
That is really not my intention. I'am just stating my exprience here... Have you raided in vanilla? Do you remember how time consuming it was? We had to farm like crazy, which is boring as hell, then we had to schedule raids and actually get ppl to show up, again boring and frustrating when it doesn't work, then we had to try the progression bosses, wipe, try again, wipe. Hours and hours of that stuff. Most of the progression raiding time is waiting, buffing, rezzing, or at least it feels that way sometimes. I really, really don't want to "scare" anyone. I just genuinely *don't get it* why people want to make this stuff even harder and more time consuming...
---
Do you know why people thank you? Because you tell them what they want to hear. I'am just telling my own experience and what I think is fun and not fun to do. For me personally the most fun is to be had when your guild is playing *for the guild* and not just for themselves.
---
Everyone has different experiences and preferences and they are all valid, but so are mine.
---
So probably look for 2nights a week guild then?
---
Amen to that. 
---
as someone on my first pvt server, in a "semi-hardcore" guild.  We clear MC/BWL in 3 hours then go do Onyxia.
---
AQ40 took 3 hours to get past Twin Emps and start clearing to Ouro/Cthun
---
They could add stealth to their bubble hearth rotation for extra safety.
---
This looks more like the Badlands than the Barren 
---
100% same story here, funny as I have done a bit of rap music production now so my perspective has changed alot. I think decision/decimusic was also a pretty good rapper but Abondation definitely the superior one of the lot.
---
Watch any classic video from 2005, they're all in 360p it's so hard to watch.
---
Stop
---
Casual guilds that are less optimized and thus need more than one day to clear the content.
---
&gt; In fact if I were in your situation id tell the guild you refuse to be on loot council, both of you.
---
This. The relationship between the two will come out regardless. Simply don't be involved in the loot distribution in any way. If OP and wife are dedicated tanks/healers in their guild (which it sounds like they will be), the gear will come their way anyway.
---
Even back then, I remember being surprised they actually took the player suggestion seriously and did it.  I ended up playing on Emerald Dream for a significant part of Classic and enjoyed it more than my previous server, Bonechewer.  So yeah, I'm sure they'll have some RP-PVP servers.
---
burn it like Teldrassil please
---
Vanilla... Some time in feb 2005 I think (EU) all the way through to downing KT in Naxx40.  Then I basically quit because I knew it would never get better than that
---
I can see the goblins mining away at it now. 
---
That’s not how that works. 
---
There are some conclusions you can draw from it, but nothing major really. He's very careful about what he says. The only thing I've ever heard him say that might break his NDA was when he said he know's what is in the next expansion (meaning he leaked that there will be an expansion after BfA, but my toddler could've probably figured that out). 
---
He did say, though, in this Classicast, that he found out about Classic 7 months before it was announced, and that he believed they had worked on it for almost a year before he found out about it.
---
After 40 man raids I would create a portal to DARN. that no one would take.  I wouldnt move and cast one to SW.  Was 50/50 where you would end up.
---
I do/did this with an alt healer (holy priest). It is not fast at all. Scratched the social itch when I was getting bored of questing alone on a main. And met plenty of people. But it is not fast.
---
For my own guild I'm considering a mixture. Loot Council for tank armor, Thunderfury, and the first few drops of BiS slots. Then DKP for the rest and Sulfuras.
---
I'm so fucking afraid of all the meme spec that got viable later on but were absolute shit in classic. This is gonna hurt really bad.
---
I know right? I can practically see the Chinese mage over there tagging elementals in the Dustbowl.
---
No slip ups? Sadface
---
Ah that makes much more sense thankyou!
---
Burn teldrassil?
---
Teldrassil seems pretty not-burnt to me. The heck version of WoW you playing? :P
---
This is the kind of question that I feel you already know the answer to. If you have a job (any job) and ask about R14 in your question, you really seem to be in denial of what you may be able to achieve in the game.
---
Do the research, on ps’s it took people 10-11 days /played on average to hit 60. Raiding guilds will require 2-3 full nights and people geared in some reasonable dungeon blues. Take a look at your schedule and figure it out...
---
&gt; He did say, though, in this Classicast, that he found out about Classic 7 months before it was announced, and that he believed they had worked on it for almost a year before he found out about it.
---
That would be just after they met the Nost team I think.
---
Exactly what i thought, specially on the left side looks like a silithid mound and the path around it.
---
My bad, i should have read the rules i apologize for this post. I will take it to the correct reddit.
---
as others have said, it's pretty garbage, but they're actually very worth it to do once, if you collect all quests beforehand, due to the loot which makes leveling a lot faster. this is especially true for melee classes who depend on up to date weapons to deal damage, as their updated spell ranks barely do anything at all. 
---
No, if it was vanilla, the book would somehow be on another continent, at the back of a random cave, surrounded by mobs.
---
My thoughts exactly 
---
So you are serious?
---
You don't even need to farm if your runs are smooth, MC+BWL+Ony gold drops sum up to approximately 70-80g which is more than enough to fund your next runs unless you're flasking. 
---
Once people have bwl gear, bwl/mc/ony in a night is doable. Once aq drops then you'll really find out what sort of guild you're in. Some will smash it out in a night, others will use countless consumes getting like 5/8  (9?).
---
[Impressive](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/017/492/bUNXwFD.jpg)
---
tbh I would have been happy with just taking the 2004 game without any 'making it Blizzard quality' stuff. But yea its going to be interesting to say the least to see how they treat classic with the main game sinking and seemingly going though an identity crisis since WoD. . 
---
Looks more like Badlands
---
Yup, it was mentioned in the stream. But he did say that it was stuff that he pieced together by himself based on the information he was given, and that it might not be 100% accurate.
---
So what, is MCP bis or not? I want to play a feral tank too, but the mcp stuff is just turning me off. But it probably is right
---
The badlands has mountains too though. Plus people can afford my ports there
---
It should only be 1 day IMO.
---
Maybe one day to progress and another day to equip alts (for those that have it/want it).
---
I really hope I can find a guild like that, becaus I don't want to spend my whole wow time raiding.
---
I thought the buff continued after changing weapon
---
How a language devolves over time: You're&gt;Your&gt;Ur.
---
Nobody would fall for this on a private server, except maybe like one random guy
---
The best "info" we've gotten from Ythissens so far is when he said the following on his stream:
---
"The no-change community is gonna win more than they think they are."
---
Thats massive to me. 
---
Based on what experience?
---
Just because you are going to use most popular guides, doesn't mean everyone is going to.

---
Adding to that, many dungeons have *a lot* of quests. Doing a quest run isn't that inefficient. It can also grant some really strong gear, especially useful for classes like warrior or rogue.
---
It will also be a great idea to research less popular zones. A sub-optimal zone might be worth traveling to rather than getting ganked in STV. You don't *have* to use it, but it's nice to know more than one route.
---
The barrens is a savanna I don't feel this pic fits the Barrens at all. 
---
Not okay
---
&gt; Theory, awesome - reality? Not so much.
---
Dude, hubdreds of guilds use LC in Vanilla today. Just look on all the guilds reqruiting today, basically ALL are using LC.
---
Loot Council is not a theory, it is used in practice every day on private servers. You will have to look hard for any guild who use DKP or EPGP...
---
Yeah that felt really good to hear. 
---
I’m playing openRSC
---
No need to apologize, happens all the time. Thanks for your understanding!
---
Because EPGP's system is terrible, Playing as a warrior I wouldn't mind getting my hands on drake talon spaulders, but I don't want the GP penalty for an item I will replace, better just hoard for Conqueror shoulders instead.
---
Cool flameguard gauntlets finally dropped but AQ is out soon and I'd rather have gauntlets of annihilation so i'm just going to not take these despite being an upgrade because it'll lower my chances of getting the piece that I actually want.
---
EPGP is terrible for the optimizer, great for the tourist.
---
I'd chill in Teldrassil for 23 hours and 59 minutes, then I'd swan dive right off the branches and pray to Elune that i'm taken out of the simulation before I hit the water.
---
Add in the requirement that you need to be level 60 to vote and I might consider it.
---
https://youtu.be/s6mnh5ANbYI
---
But that was the entire draw of good old youtube. Back then pretty much nobody made videos for money, and nobody expected to see anything polished or professionally made. It gave people like Nyhm and co. the freedom to do wacky and weird content. I'd take it any day over today's "Like comment and subscribe" content.
---
because healers don't need to drink in dungeons? will you just grind dungeons 10x in a row without vendoring loot? then how will you get gold? how will you get reputation for factions? you think you won't wipe with random groups and have to walk from the ghost healer several times? it takes like half an hour for everyone to arrive at the dungeon also. contesting mobs isn't a problem outside of overpopulated servers, by the way. 
---
i don't understand where your wishful thinking comes from, but i'm sure you have your reasons. i'm all for people having fun in whatever way they want to, but please don't deny reality. 
---
That is literally absolutely insane
---
*"I mean, no, I can't really* ***pay*** *you that much, but really isn't it about the experience?"*
---
Oh god.  We are interns.
---
With a 1% drop rate and it was glorious 
---
&gt;you cant even carry enough mcps in your bags to have 100% uptime on all bosses for the night
---
Do you use 4 slot bags? You have 3 charges of 30 second per item. That's 1 min 30 seconds per inventory slot. Assuming 16 slot bags and you use your main bag for crap you will have enough for 96 minutes uptime. And you don't need 100% raid uptime, only 100% boss uptime. You don't spend 96 minutes actively fighting during *one* raid. 
---
Actually, thinking about it even if you use 4 slot bags and your main bag is full of crap you have 24 minutes of up time - MC have been cleared in less time.
---
I know there will be, like there’ll be guilds using dkp/epgp. However I personally do not see Loot-Council as the better method of the two(three?).
---
EPGP, is a hassle to keep updated, but there is addons for that; and spreadsheets. Invoking different rule-setups makes it a lot more versatile than Loot-council, and room for drama a lot less likely to happen. 
---
“Hey see, the ratio says I won it- Woohu”
---
“Hey, the 5 dudes who dont like me cause i said they bad in wsg, gave the item to the gm’s cat”
---
for in the optimal gearing, in an Utopia world, loot Council might be best - selected few to look at Whats best for all, rather than 1.
---
... but as with Communism, that Utopia world, just isn’t there- hence, in theory awesome. Reality? Not so much.
---
No doubt a lot of guilds will use either system tho.
---
Well there you go. Right click report won't be a problem since false reports will get you banned. Glad to have that confirmed.
---
If you want to get someone chat banned for a day or two and get your entire account banned then go knock yourself out.
---
If we are going back to 2005, then I will actually be reading Penny Arcade...
---
I remember thinking these used to be cool when I was younger, now I am really feeling the cringe. It's not a bad concept, but a combination of poor rapping and weird mic quality makes it all feel very underwhelming. 
---
If you are looking for a 4th come launch, and you personally are not married to being healer, I think I may fit into your group quite well. Just sayin'
---
It kinda does mean that the most people who use guides at all will be using the same ones, though.  That's what "popular" means.
---
I'm a g600 man myself.
---
You dont really need it when you tank unless you want to push tps for some reason.
---
It's really slow, and while it might seem fun, it gets boring fast. 
---
The m.a.g.e rap lol. Playing a mage too back then just hummed along playing
---
&lt;3
---
With all mobs having a 100% chance to daze you
---
19 bosses in one night? Yeah, nah. Not unless you were raiding for 5 hours. 
---
Stack that fire + dmg like crazy and you'll be shooting 40% off health with fireballs on other twinks, and way more on non twinks
---
GAA!!! Opposite of what I wrote (sorry, it was late)! You'll want a slow MH and fast OH. Don't be afraid to use a dagger. Make sure you're hitcapped before any of this, it should be your primary concern when raiding. Also, be sure to estimate boss fight duration. If it's a 4 minute fight, you should pop Deathwish about 20 seconds into the fight and go nuts, that way you'll have it for the execute phase. I've seen too many warriors sit on it until they can execute, which really lowers their damage contribution. 
---
When in certain boss fights, when you have to DPS out and run for your life, don't forget to use your weapon swap and stance macro to switch to Defense Stance, equip a shield and nail shield wall. You're DPS out, now your job is to stay alive. You'll get the timing down I'm sure.
---
Anyhow, spirit gear, leveling to 40 is pain. Level 44-60 is also pain. I would recommend that you go Herbalist and Alch because nothing sells like flasks and pots do on a Tuesday night, and you're guild is going to need them. 
---
MCP is for kitty not bear. Bear BIS wep is Warden Staff or Unyielding Maul from DM North. (Those are the tanky options) 
---
Part of the problem with level 19 Mages is that they are missing a ton of really good spells like Counterspell, Mana Shield, Blink, Scorch, Blast Wave, and Blizzard. At that rate you’re basically just a frost bolt machine with low additional spell power. That seems a lot more dicey than 29 where you have so much more utility.
---
At 19 and 29 only certain classes are really considered strong. Rogue and Hunter are very popular at 19. Same goes for 29 with the addition of Mage and Priest.
---
At 39 most classes are twink viable, but some are of course stronger than others.
---
This comment is why I visit this sub 
---
Good times! Nyhm actually did one in Legion!
---
Rejuv yes, Regrowth is pretty much just a garbage spell in vanilla though. EXTREMELY Mana inefficient.
---
The demo was just blizzard trolling and we starting from the beginning due to some miracle files.
---
You don't really downrank HoTs unless you're trying to bait somebody into dispelling rank 1 HoTs.
---
Druid healing is 95% Holy Touch. Sorry.
---
You don't play 24/0/27 in PvP.
---
This is very romanticized, and you speak as if I haven't played vanilla. You don't know if I did. Vanilla was great because of a lot of things, but not because of a huge zone with nothing exceptional to do or look at, which you are stuck in for a long time. Sure, it can be fun once, but I'm not eager to go back there. Iconic doesn't mean it's enjoyable.
---
At least tips can look somewhat presentable. The other two look like clowns
---
Have you guys ever played a pserver fresh launch?  It doesn't matter what you do...guide, no guide...there will be people EVERYWHERE.  Every inch of the map will have players killing things.  There's no place safe during a fresh server start.
---
And even with the slow down of having to wait for respawns and fight for mob tags...it's still faster than dungeon leveling lmao!
---
Yeah the issue with Druid healing is that you have no equivalent to 1.5s casts that the other classes have. Or dispel protection.
---
The one niche Druids have that they are unquestionably the best at is flag runner. Flag runner is still a Resto spec, just that its focused on keeping yourself alive while running the flag rather than healing your allies.
---
Because of debuff slots most guilds don't let bleeds on bosses. There are like 10 near mandatory buffs (sunder, FF, COR, COE, COS, imp shadow bolt, Nightfall, Winter's chill, COW, Tclap, Demo....idk. Shadow Weaving if you have a lot of locks) plus all the bleeds just from wars critting or rogues using Lobotomizer because it's the easiest dagger to get means you kinda just waste energy to put a bleed up that's just gonna get kicked off. 
---
Firstly dont pay attention to what people do on unofficial servers. They're grossly inaccurate and basically a joke. 
---
Raiding is different in classic. You still have to do things like ZG even if you're a Naxx guild to make sure everyone is exalted so they can get shoulder enchants and do at least jin'do and bloodlord so people can make head/leg class enchants. If your guild is very stable and everyone exalted with Zandalar then that cuts down on having to go back to ZG.
---
Since theres 40 people and less drops from bosses in raids guilds will usually farm a previous tier to gear up new people and others who havent gotten loot. 
---
2 nights for progression and 1 night of farming. Raiding older content thats on farm and not that challenging can be the most fun. People are more relaxed and talkative when raiding the farmed content. Its a lot more social. Sometimes on off-night guilds would have AQ20 raids that werent mandatory and non-DKP. Sometimes bring would bring their alts or people would mix with other guilds. 
---
Yeah that was one of the Scarlet Onslaught Admiral Westwind, he ended up getting possessed by Mal’Ganis. When you defeat him he swears he will get revenge on the Lich King but oddly enough you never see him again. 
---
sorry that you're stuck in 2004
---
Yeah if u think transformers r cool
---
Hope it's true, man this wait is killing me I just want to be again in Azeroth. I miss WOW a lot.
---
Friend, at the end of the day it's about having fun. I am talking from my experience when I played Vanilla the 1st time. It didn't matter to me that I was a night elf rogue. Maybe the top guilds going for world 1st wouldn't choose me, maybe the best pvp guild wouldn't choose me (unlikely, skill tramples racials). What does it matter? There are so many layers to Vanilla, your race/class combination is the least of what matters when it comes to having fun.
---
I'm on mobile. Can someone link Kripp's video where he discovered the sniperino guild for this guy? 
---
Not disagreeing with his overall statement since the kripp sniper guild is an anomaly, but he may find the video quite interesting. 
---
I am hoping I don't end up in any streamer servers. Hope everyone can discuss about it on diacord and join.
---
Imagine the eve before classic wow release ohohoh
---
What? 
---
I'm not putting words in your mouth, you're arguing inapplicable facts.
---
The claim I put forth, was that Vanilla WoW was always going to have expansions.
---
You said "They weren't because they thought they would only need a few servers to upkeep". 
---
well, yea, he's got to drive sales somehow... and your reward for buying from him and bringing him the meat, some cooked turtle. He's basically tricked you into buying his food and calling it a quest.
---
For horde, this is what you want to follow.
---
[https://www.joanasworld.com/](https://www.joanasworld.com/)
---
OTC warrior in Barrens, I will run to razor hill to rest in the in there 
---
i mean if youre doing some sort of progression and everybodys hopped up on world buffs its good to start off with a mcp to double your maul output in case you get a bunch of misses/dodges early on
---
It doesn't. 
---
yes, and nobody doubted quest runs are efficient. the topic is grinding dungeons. And the xp you get from mobs in dungeons are not worth it.
---
I'm assuming a raid night is 4 hours of raiding. For hardcore guilds one raid night with perhaps a second shorter raid night for Ony/ZG works well until AQ releases. Then you really want 2 raid nights. And when Naxx comes out 3 raid nights would be best.
---
Progression time commitment is going to vary, but here's how long raids tend to take when they are totally on farm with 0 wipes to give you an absolute minimum baseline. You really want to dedicate at least three times as much time as I list to make solid progress during progression:
---
MC: 1 hour.
---
BWL: 1 hour.
---
AQ40: 2 hours.
---
Naxx: 4 hours.
---
This doesn't count any time needed to get to the raid or prepare world buffs like Ony/ZG head turn ins.
---
Hardcore speedrunning guilds can clear raids in about half to a third the time I listed but requires max consumables, world buffs, everyone being really focused the whole time and using speedrun strats, etc.
---
Now I just need to learn how to sleep while sitting up.
---
I want to commend you on your showcase of patience during this. Very well done !
---
You can’t get rank 14 without dedicating 16 hours a day for at least 3 months.
---
Your best bet is to join the best guild on the server. Usually raids 2 nights a week, 3 with new raids.
---
Good guilds raid less but more efficient than shitty casual guilds.
---
That's cuz all the druids in the discord are massive Shedo Fans. So whatever he says counts.   
---
I've seen enough Ferals pull competitive dps and then some, entirely without it.   
---
For example: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrC9AJRajGA&amp;t=21s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrC9AJRajGA&amp;t=21s) (might want to mute it though)
---
A few missing armor values and proc rates isnt "grossly inaccurate" . And it certainly doesnt mean you cant learn from guilds on private servers.
---
Not okay.
---
Yes.
---
I find myself in the same boat.
---
You shouldn't be forced to mule shit to an alt just to roleplay as the guild bank. That is completely retarded. On the same token, me wanting guild banks doesn't mean I want flying mounts. 
---
There's nuance to be had, and a lot of the community doesn't really see that.
---
At best surviving, a living doubt it unless you have the looks and charisma or Chris Hemsworth.
---
RP in WoW is art.
---
It isn't as clear as you think it is. Yes, you are right, cats have better DPS so usually a very good choice for leveling.
---
However, I plan to level with a mage so an Owl is a very good choice since they have AoE threat and little bit tankier while having still one of the best DPS (not as much as cats though). This pet will allow to keep threat on multiple mobs easier which will in return better DPS overall. 
---
It really depends on what is your main goal while leveling. I do want to point out that cats are probably the best option &gt;80%  of the time.
---
Its almost as if Blizz is considering the fallout from their decisions
---
29 is good for mages but you will have to work harder to be able to compete with middle of the road hunters and rogues. Also, my experiences as a 29 mage were in TBC though when there were more Stam enchants / profession advantages.
---
I have the looks of Asmongold. But I doubt thats a bonus... :D
---
Much better at 29 than at 19. Hunters will eat you at 19. 
---
Yes, and this was a **VERY** common mindset during release. Then the game started dying very quickly with no new content and they decided to poll updates, and now OSRS is the biggest it's been since release.
---
Playing a rogue in bgs isnt fun or powerful
---
Well, thanks, that's correct.
---
I didn't discovered the main reason for too long text, because in any topic with this keyboard guys discuss about unimportant problem - "How to install this keyboard under Win10".
---
That's a waste of time because solution may be googled in 5 minutes.
---
Real problem I've explained in my post.
---
There is may help only a great luck.
---
No roleplayer will slow down and do RP stuff when they are in a group to complete a PvE quest or dungeon.
---
Roleplayers rush as much as anyone else does.
---
If you manage to go around &amp; grab all the quests, a few dungeons have decent XP - I remember all the Uldaman quests, which take 2-3 runs to compete all of them, will yield almost a full level of xp at the appropriate level. The problem is coordinating your time with a full dungeon party. Unless you're leveling on a high-pop server where everyone is making the initial leveling push, you will find that there are more efficient uses of your in-game time in most cases.
---
Purely grinding through dungeons without going for all the quests isn't worth the xp you will gain. The quickest way to level is always grinding, but it's the most boring, too.
---
Night elves worship Elune.
---
Depends on a guild to guild basis. You think you can clear everything but you don’t know how good your guildmates will be. 
---
I mean a lot of dungeons are usually good for a level or so with their quests, and the chance to get a few sizeable upgrades makes it a no brainer as well. 
---
Just dont get fixated on one piece of gear that wont drop for you long after youved done the quests.
---
If NE priests can smite with the moon’s light, why can’t their paladins?
---
Don’t know much about WoW lore outside of the RTS and mmo quests.
---
While Stockades is a boring dungeon with almost no loot to speak of, it's great to run through once for the half dozen or so quests available in there. Most of which are picked up from quest hubs you'll be around at that level anyway.
---
Humans have perception which is great for pvp and you can talent sprint to break a lot of cc.
---
Dont forget the pyroblasts!
---
&gt;He did say, though, in this Classicast, that he found out about Classic 7 months before it was announced, and that he believed they had worked on it for almost a year before he found out about it.
---
and then..
---
&gt;You think you do, but you don't
---
WTF?
---
Ha, hello!
---
Yes, keyboard was probably good, if it still stays on my computer table.
---
I hope, that I can customize manually some .mod file from any keyset (If someone will upload it) to my 2 keysets, which I have.
---
Of course, I'll upload final result further.
---
fwiw, AoE farming (as a mage) was one of the most fun and memorable things I did in vanilla
---
Because the light and elune are 2 different things.
---
But can’t Paladins draw energy from different sources, like the BElves and Tauren?
---
Being a MT in vanilla is significantly more difficult than retail. If you are off with your rotations, don’t have fully optimized gear and enchants, or bring 100% consumables to the raid, your inefficiency will not only hurt your survivability like retail. It will hurt the DPS, significantly decrease the boss kill time which affects healers, which will hurt the DPS even more. The difference between a slightly inefficient vs optimized MT is absolutely massive, and you need to be 100% committed to it or you will have a mediocre at best guild. If you can handle that, you can find a spot in almost any guild. 
---
For a priest BFD for the wand reward for sure. As alliance druid the deadmines for the tunic and gnomeregan for the pants. Both of them are so powerful you won't change them until level 40 and 50.
---
All of them. Running the dungeons is the purpose of playing Classic for me.
---
Hardcore speedrunning guilds can clear raids in about half to a third the time I listed but requires max consumables, world buffs, class stacking melees in MC/BWL, everyone being really focused the whole time and using speedrun strats, etc.
---
&gt; instance leveling 
---
what do you mean? You mean completely skipping all quests? But then, why even care about instances?
---
&gt;  to heal or tank instances from VC to lvl 60 
---
You better still do quests in between, to get some dungeon quests at least.
---
&gt; FWIW I will be playing horde priest to give some perspective.
---
Or the Horde equiv to Stockades (name escapes me atm, as I am primarily an Alliance player).
---
I always try running most of them. If you do wc, sfk and bfd as horde you can skip the shit show that is hillsbrad easily. If you do RFK, gnomeregan, sm lib-arm-cat as well as RFD you can also skip basically all of the shit show that is stv.
---
&gt; Ends up being the gm’s gf in full bis, his best m8 gets raptor Mount 
---
Any guild / GM that behaved like this would lose all their players long before their first raid.
---
Instances give you a full level usually. 75% of that level is from the instance quests. And it’s already less efficient than questing/grinding. So if you’re doing instances without quests you are leveling I would say 5x slower than normal. Doing each dungeon once I would recommend because it’s not that much less efficient than questing and you get a break from the grind, plus a chance at some gear. 
---
I didn’t think there was a cap in vanilla
---
If it was up to me, that mage deserves a suspension.
---
I completely disagree with an automated banning system, but if I was a GM and a player had been doing that shit in AV, I'd ban them for 48 hours.
---
Anything Maraudon and higher.

Zul'Farrak for quests, Sunken Temple same, Gnomeregan is too good for quests, but everyone hates it anyway, and half of your group will leave after the first wipe.

At 60 a good build would look roughly like [this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxuoxZVGuI0zyo). While leveling your first priority is to get consecration in the holy tree so you can start tanking, then put the rest of the points in prot until Holy Shield. Paladins don't need to invest any talents to be capable healers outside of raids, all they need is enough int gear.
---
It definitely was. Couldn't find the patch notes on how they've changed it over time, [but looks like it was indeed 50g](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Class_trainer).
---
If you're playing with friends, you shouldn't have any problem tanking once you get Righteous Fury, or healing if you had a decent set of Int gear until around ST/Mara.
---
You can just go Ret and still do fine until then.
---
Oh so you think that this is staged? After snorting five lines of cocaine, receiving a kidney shot from Mike Tyson and watching "Top 10 Conspiracy Theories" on Youtube in an infinite loop I might come to the same conclusion.
---
Dungeons are not a bad idea if you can get every quest, you get 1-1.6 levels for a full quest run and you get a break from grinding. Plus a chance at gear. Some dungeons are necessary for some classes. For rogues, SM full+RFD is mandatory. For rogues/warriors, Mara is 100% mandatory.
---
All of them are worth it.
---
The journey to 60 is half the game. Skipping over the content just makes it a boring grind.
---
I try to do every dungeon that's regularly run by Alliance.

It's especially good for priests, since healers can be lower level by a decent margin and still do ok.

If this really was you, tell me what ui addon that is

how long is a single shift?
---
Newman's landing I would just chill there. Found the place by accident one and it instantly became my fav place. So relaxing and peaceful
---
If you want to twink, I would really advise going to the 49 bracket. It offers so much more complete and balanced PvP then other brackets, where certain classes can cheese thanks to them getting certain spells/talents early.
---
It's obviously more difficult to gear a 49 twink, but the bracket is so much more rewarding to play in than any other, imo.
---
Most guilds that use EPGP have a failsafe such that if nobody wants to bid it becomes free roll, or you can bid reduced GP. Just like most guilds will give uncontested offspec items to people for no GP.

While playing Vanilla I never ONCE got to run Gnomer because the only times I could actually put a group together to do it, the group fell apart immediately. 
---
I really want to "right" that "wrong" this time around, just for the experience. 
---
Agreed, one thing I'd like to throw out too is that dungeons are also a great experience for people not just in general (team building, getting familiar with people on your server, etc.) but it allows people to practice their eventual endgame role. Warriors can get a feel for tanking, priests for healing and hybrid classes can try to find the role they best fit into (the answer is healing :P ). 
---
This'll be my SO's first time playing and she's playing a priest, so I hope that we'll be able to run a few dungeons together so she can get nail down healing a group by the time we hit the late game 5 mans and UBRS. 
---
Dude. DurOtAr.
---
Yes, I would never join a LC guild. It requires either being an officer, or sucking the officers’ dicks, and I don’t play a game to engage in the same corporate dicksucking that makes many jobs so unpalatable. Quantitative loot systems are predictable, free of human bias, and promote member retention as people don’t want to lose the points that they’ve accumulated.
---
It’s bad enough having to raid with an officers e-gf that deals half the DPS of the people that actually should be in the guild (I’ve actually experienced this, she literally dealt half my dps in very similar gear in what was supposed to be a raiding guild) and it would be worse if she also got all of the rare BiS drops.
---
So much farming tho:p
---
Login server down
---
but where is Connecting...?
---
My SO and I work 8-5 Monday - Friday and work a part time job Tuesday and Friday, off on weekends. My wife and I also typically cook every night (save Tuesday and Friday) and prepare for lunch/dinner the next day, so it's going to be tight. 
---
What I'm hoping to do is save up enough in my savings so that we can go down to 1 day a week at our part time job while Classic gets into full swing and we start raiding, and we're taking off ~ a week and a half at launch to try and get as ahead of the pack as possible while still enjoying the game. 
---
So, I suppose my "schedule" is going to be play as much as possible during the first 2 weeks at launch, then when we go back to our jobs we'll play from ~ 6 - 9:30 while playing together (SO and myself), once my SO goes to bed I'll probably jump on an alt (hunter or lock, haven't decided which yet) and then we'll play all weekend. 
---
&gt;Are certain grinds (e.g. rank 14) even possible with a 9-5?
---
Honestly, probably not. If it's anything like Vanilla retail you literally have to account share to get Rank 14, but take that with a grain of salt as I was on Arthas US and we had an EXTREMELY competitive PVP community with the likes of Maydie, Pat and quite a few others who hit Rank 14 during Vanillas run. 
---
level 80 paladins need premium to message a match
---
As an ally mage I’ll be running Deadmines @21, Stockades @29, Gnomie &amp;31, Scarlet Monastary @38, Uldaman @43, Zul’Farrak @44, Maraudon @48. These can all yield great xp, drops and q rewards. (And much fun!) Dire Maul East @56.
---
As a priest I might run BFD@26 for the wand. On top of that, maybe RFD@40 and maybe ST@54 just to break up the grind a bit...
---
How does somebody get to 60 without knowing how mage portals work?
---
leveling 1-10 and doing the quest
---
First week or so, 80-100, then 60, and possibly down to 40
---
He won’t have shadow damage. It was patched prior to 1.12 so he will be just another normal wolf. You’re better off killing him for the greens he drops.
---
Why would you not use EPGP if you were doing Loot Council though? Using EPGP makes it easier for loot council to track raid attendance, track loot awarded, track outside of raid effort, and makes it easier for raiders to show interest in items (major/minor/offspec + note). 
---
Maybe the EPGP addon on pservers is incomplete, so that's why it's not popular? But assuming the modern EPGP addon gets updated for classic I'm going to be whining pretty hard to get my guild to use it. It seems really dumb not to.
---
I have this book somewhere! Need to find it though......
---
Yeah, Warrior, Rogue and Shammy would be super strong indeed and fun.
---
If he accelerated the speed of the video even more he could have done it in less than a minute...
---
You're misrepresenting the context.
---
Blizzard thought the game would have a small player base and only need a few servers for a few thousand players and about 30 or so staff members to upkeep - this was before release day.
---
The context is that Blizzard had never planned to do anything beyond regular content updates to Vanilla because they thought the game would not be a huge success. Day 1 of launch is when they realized they were wrong and scrambled, which completely changed the trajectory and plans for the game.
---
Mentioning that they thought they would only need a few servers and a small team to upkeep was an ADDENDUM, not a reason.
---
I'm going back re-reading my post and I can't figure out how anyone can see that it was to offer context to their own thinking before release.
---
Vanilla's launch had major issues because they didn't expect it to take off and lacked the infrastructure - again, more context to why they hadn't planned anything beyond adding content to the game instead of expansions.
---
Context. Not a reason. There's ZERO need to shoehorn your misunderstanding just to force an argument.
---
That's petty.
---
So I'm taking you did not watch it. Got it.
---
Why? Wow went to shit in TBC.
---
Rift Online was a great MMORPG, but it was really bad in this regard. 
---
What isn't worth it is running any of them more than once to try and get a specific item, unless it's something you will still be wearing at 60 it's time that could be better spent.
---
The best ones are going to be the ones that you have quests for with rewards you can use, guaranteed upgrade even if you don't have any luck with drops. Like SFK would be worth doing for a horde priest, iirc there's a cloth shoulder from one of the quests and you get a chance at Arugal's robe.
---
No, if it was vanilla, the book would require you to go to another continent, into the back of a deep cave system, only to have you find the binders of the book, but with several pages missing. You would then get part 2 of the quest chain which would have you collect 10 pages of the book from nearby mobs with a 1% drop rate. Then you would get part 3 of the quest chain, which would have you travelling back across the world to a guy standing next to the original quest giver, and ask him to rebind the book for you. This would lead into part 4, which would have you collect glue from the local bear asses in Hillsbrad Foothills, then bring it back to the guy next to the quest giver and he would rebind it. This would lead you to part 5, which is literally only to turn around and hand the main guy his book.
---
Neither fury nor +pet damage end up mattering too much. Pets do not scale (and PvE-wise are likely to be sacrificed...) so the +pet damage is a buff to leveling at best and VW isn't a damage-dealing focused pet... Fury is +melee ap only along a healing reduction debuff, quite useless. 
---
The choice is hardiness vs slightly better stats+WotF+Cannibalize from UD. 
---
Thanks but that bracket is dead on my server unfortunately

OOH! I have math to support this!
---
Say you wanted to level The Deadmines from 18-24.
---
First run of The Deadmines would grant you about 16,000xp, for about 90 minutes. Let's assume each successive run was about 60 minutes.
---
**Level 18**
---
- 1st 90 minute run gets you 16,000 of the 17,400xp needed, close enough, level 19 in 1 hour.
---
**Level 19**
---
- 11,092xp to kill all the mobs, in an hour, so ~11,000xph
---
- 19,300xp to level.
---
- 1.75 runs, 1 hour 45 minutes to ding 20.
---
**Level 20**
---
- 20,800xp needed
---
- 10,651xph from kills
---
- 2 runs, 2 hours to ding 21
---
**Level 21**
---
- 22,400xp needed
---
- 9,761xp from kills
---
- 2.3 runs, 2 hours 20 to ding 22
---
**Level 22**
---
- 24,000xp needed
---
- 9,273 xp per run
---
- 2.6 runs, 2 hours 35 to ding 23
---
**Level 23**
---
- 25,500xp needed
---
- 8,809 xp per run
---
- 2.9 runs, 3 hours to ding 24
---
18-24 has taken you 13 hours by running The Deadmines. By comparison, 18-24 through leveling can be done in 5-6 hours by a tryhard. 8 at a reasonable pace.
---
The Deadmines dungeoning is 1.5 times to 2 times slower than leveling normally.
---
Some horde don't run it because they think it requires a lot of travelling but if you pick up the quests you can teleport there from boot bay.
---
sounds like you should play druid. you will only be in raids once a week, so don't let that guide your choice.
---
You see: Zed. Zed’s dead. 
---
What you're saying makes 0 sense.
---
Yes, they didn't think WoW would be as successful, but that doesn't mean they didn't plan for expansions or post launch content.
---
Thats the whole point of subscriptions.
---
You don't need 10 million subscribers for expansions to be viable. Everquest, DAOC, Asheron's Call, games that WoW competed with, had expansion packs. 
---
You're assuming "Blizzard did not expect WoW to be that huge of a success" to mean "Blizzard did not plan to have post-release content/ expansion packs, which is silly. Every MMO at the time were chugging out expansion packs.
---
Probably a Night Elf druid. Just chilling in the Emerald Dreams for 10k years. My kind of life.
---
Same here man. I'm playing ESO of all things right now because I need that RPG fix and I can't stay on BFA longer than a week. WoW really has changed so much from what made it great. 
---
I cannot wait for this summer. Also I really hope the community is there. It's up to all of us to reignite that great Vanilla community we all remember. Without that the game will be DOA.
---
lol private server hero
---
Nothing really until you start getting into the BRD+ range of dungeons.  That's the point where you start getting gear you'll still be using at 60.
---
Because If you want new content, that seems to be a logical thing to ask for, instead of trying to sully Classic.
---
&gt;In classic, are two raid nights enough to clear everything each week? Or should I look for a guild that has three raid nights for optimal clearing?
---
It really depends on the guild you're in. For example, people that have been playing on "undocumented servers" for the past X years will more than likely be able to clear MC/Ony within a few nights if not their first night, whereas if you're in a group of people playing the game for the first time it may take you weeks or months before you can clear them, and some guilds may even fall apart before that. 
---
If I were you, I'd ask myself "how much time can I dedicate to playing the game every night/week" and use that as my guide to find a guild. Just my .02. 
---
I agree that guild banks would not in of themselves be an issue, but the problem is the slippery slope. While we might both agree that guild banks are fine, as soon as they start adding changes, what’s to stop them from adding other “harmless” changes? 
---
What about transmog? After all it “doesn’t affect gameplay.” What about instant teleport to dungeon? Once we have that, why no dungeon queue? By locking it to things that actually existed in a vanilla patch, we lock out a lot of the BS without having to argue about it, and therefore help preserve the integrity of the game long term.
---
Thats why Nost made over 5000 changes while they were working on it. Why private server heroes were reporting bugs in the demo that werent bugs. 
---
Why I find 5 lots of khadgar's whisker lumped together on unofficial realms.
---
Why WoW devs laughed when Nost explained how they scripted the Onyxia.
---
But you keep going, PSH!
---
I'm in the no changes boat, but if they would go the route of adding content, I'd rather they add completely new content with the vanilla spirit in mind, BUT still have servers up with no changes, ever.
---
The way you need to look at it is that your players are most likely only able to raid on specific nights, and will partly pick guild according to raid days.
---
Have 3 potential raid days from the get go. It makes no sense to start out with less, and then when you suddenly need another raid day, you need to start doing strawpolls and most people can't make it, because they applied to raid on specific nights.
---
Have 3 raid days.
---
Day 1: This is primary raid day, you will A L W A Y S raid on this day. 
---
Day 2: This is the progression/farm day. This is where you raid if you aren't finished with progressing a raid, this is where you raid when onyxia 5day reset doesn't line up with main raid, this is where you do ZG+AQ20.
---
And then a 3rd day, this probably won't get properly used before AQ or even naxx, but just keep it in players mind, do pug or 20man runs on this day to imprint it as a potential raid day. 
---
How it's typically done on pservers(which may be easier than classic will be, we don't know):
---
MC+ony can easily be cleared in one night. 
---
BWL often requires guilds to take 2 raid days to clear on first week. Then they move on to a BWL 1day, mc+ony next day. Good guilds are able to do all 3 in one night around the time ZG comes out, where ZG is then done on 2nd raidday. Really good guilds do a mandatory ZG raid on top of bwl/mc/ony.
---
Come AQ every guild needs 2 raid days just because there's so much content and 2x 20man raids to clear every 3 days.
---
Naxx usually demands 3 raid days every week until cleared leaving no room to clear anything else.
---
Just a detail off. Shaman's Lightning Bolt is faster. 3 sec base, 2 with full Lightning Mastery since it reduces 0.2 per talent point (and it's still a 5-point talent). 
---
Thats legin on that server(BWL drop), at least during closed beta stage.
---
Pretty unrealistic times and doesn't account for progression.
---
You think you do but you do?
---
Rank 14 is really probably not viable for you unless you are really giving every ounce of free time you have to the grind. Even then, probably not.
---
Something more realistic would be rank 13 and would look something like an extended grind from 1 to 12 and then for the final push to 13 you take a week off work to get it done. Alot of the rank 14 weapons have PVE equivalents that are very comparable and much easier to get. 
---
Everything else is achievable on a normal 9-5 schedule. 
---
Started in 1.5 or 1.6 and I can't recall which exactly but I do remember being overly pleased with connected flight paths that came with 1.7. Dinged 60 shortly after 1.9.
---
Thatd be an interesting compromise. I think they'd more likely want to add servers for early expansions, as they have their fans. Personally, while TBC did a lot of stupid stuff I disagree with, gameplay wise I think its my favorite expansion. 
---
Stunned Pikachu face
---
This forum is for discussion about Classic WoW. Not whatever private server you're playing on, dude.
---
&gt;  if you pick up the quests you can teleport there from boot bay.
---
Exactly, the few times I was able to get a group together we'd go from Org to Grom then fly to STV (because eff walking through the noise that is STV) and use the teleporter. 
---
Unfortunately literally every one of the groups that I could put together typically fell apart before the first boss or right after it. 
---
There are no 25 mans in classic...
---
Delete this*
---
Hopefully we will get robust servers, I accepted things on the pserver I tried but hope for better service from Blizzard, especially as I will pay for it!
---
Alright. Thank you my friend :)
---
So I just need to farm prot and heal gear and go for your build?
---
Thank you :) 
---
If the buff persisted through swap then the MCP would be BIS for every class that could equip a 2h mace.
---
Fixing bugs happened constantly throughout vanilla. Finding extra Khadgar's whispers doesn't really change how the game progresses, what guilds need to do to prepare for raids, how many raid nights a week are needed, what items should be held on to for later (such as NR gear). 
---
Having Ony Deep Breath a bit more/less really doesn't change the fight that much, WoW dev laughter aside.
---
What is the reason for not putting points into Anticipation, which increases Defense by 10 points? 
---
I guess I am mistaken. I was only speaking from my experience when I grouped with RPers and they actually stopped during dungeons to take in the moment after mid boss kills. It took longer to complete the dungeon, but it was more enjoyable for me. 
---
that one handed blue sword from the wailing caverns quest is some good shit.  like every horde warrior rogue and Hunter has it equipped until level 30
---
I guess it is wrong of me to say 'no roleplayer' but it's *extremely* unlikely and you got to witness once in a lifetime event.
---
Called it the Candyland patch because they severely nerfed I think all raid content and definitely Sunwell (with the idea being so that everyone could "see" it, like an actual theme park).  We had been working on KJ hard trying to beat him before that patch and then it hit and we killed him in far less time than the majority of our wipes (because dmg/hp on everything was reduced so much).  My motivation for raiding pretty much went out the door since farming Sunwell was going to be a snorefest, the gear wouldnt compete with insane hp on wotlk gear, and wotlk looked like it was just going to expand Candyland with easy raids (although I guess I missed Ulduar, it held true for initial raids).
---
I found a really good resource that kind of explains what I'm after. I found an old addon that does pretty much what I want to accomplish, except make it browser based. Maybe I can decipher this guys LUA code and figure out the math. [Addon is Yatlas.](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info4497-Yatlas.html)
---
That was the best feeling ever. After sucess seeing my 10 lvl dwarf ready to  levep up.Was an insane feeling!
---
So it's not really only in theory when we have an actual example of it working.
---
I would guess it is at least 400% slower. A major part of your exp normally is quests, and you wont get that.
---
Dungeons are great if you have a pre-made group. The experience from quests will give you a huge boost and you might get lucky with one or two blue items (you notice big difference with those blue items at lower levels).
---
But like I said, since you play priest you should probably try and find a friend that is willing to level with you as a tank.. because finding a tank while stressing about time is not a good mix in vanilla WoW.
---
"Ah, finally, a group who wants to do this.  We all ready?"

"Yeah."

"Yeah, let's go."

If you don't stack defense, you get some Redoubt/Reckoning uptime. It's not like you need defense for dungeon tanking anyway.
---
The amount of times I've accidentally aggrod a mob into someone doing the Defias escort while kiting might actually get my killed lol 
---
2 points of defense reduces damage taken by less than 2% armor from toughness, which is the main reason. But also part of that damage reduction comes from reducing the chance of being crit, which is a double edged sword for prot paladins as when they are crit they get increased block chance and reckoning attacks.
---
Sure, much of it is. But this looks much like the border of the Barrens. 
---
Read my post again instead of just skimming it.

I disagree

Fear not! Sharding  combined with cloud servers is the proven winning formula! /s

Exactly, yes.

It’s more the guys asking to find his book he lost at the other side of the world in a place surrounded by 10 000 mob which are trying to bang you like a Swiss piece of cheese.

Maybe it will make you smarter dummy warrior and next time you will not accept a quest from a silly man like me ! HAHA

Damn, I really miss Vanilla.

For 19 WSG, stack stamina gear/enchants, 1h with 22int enchant and the furbolg pouch. Mages at 19 don't do well as a glass cannon but are awesome at flag support. With poly, nova and frost bolt(use rank 1 to cast faster and never go oom) you can keep the enemy offense at bay and your FC safe. You aren't going to be doing damage and getting killing blows but you can kite people all day and will be able to make big impact in games by playing support. It's not as "exciting" as ripping off big fireballs but you will win more games as a beefy frost bolt sheep machine.
---
Why does he deserve a suspension? Players have the ability to see the portal and realise it's not a summon. Their own stupidity, the mage isn't at fault for that.
---
"You think you do, but you don't" was said on BlizzCon 2013, the announcement was on BlizzCon 2017. He knew about Classic around April 2017. That's almost 4 years difference.
---
Warlock is dynamic as hell, you get to spread aids and juggle several mobs at once. Your downtime is minimal if not zero. At 60 you can farm maraudon for 30-50gph until DME comes out for that 50+gph. Big shadowbolt crits. 
---
Eventually even the best guild will become 3 day raiding guilds. There is just too much content that you need to farm to not raid 3 days a week.
---
This post brought to by a bad 19 FC who was carried by a really good mage. 
---
It was’t intirely clear if that was a year prior to blizzcon 2017, or a year prior to him finding out about it
---
What if the weight of your vote was dependent on your active playtime over the last year or so (with diminishing returns). A player with three Naxx'd out level 60 characters should have a much louder voice than someone who just got to level 60 and quit, and a person who has played socially every day for a year but hasn't reached 60 yet should still have *some* voice.
---
Mostly I would like to have the faction balance % posted on the server. That would hopefully let people even out the faction % with their choices.
---
It sucks being on an unbalanced population server for both sides. The lower pop faction can't compete in the world for bosses/PvP and the higher pop faction will have wait times for BGs.
---
Vanilla tanking is not near the same as other expansions. So I wish you the best of luck from one tank to another.
---
The description of how the water cooler update was crafted was an insight. He basically admitted it was written by marketing, as any technical person could have confirmed. The part where they “explain” old vs. modern graphics cards was so marketing bs. 
---
Same. Dungeons are my favorite part of the game.  They break up the grind and allow you to actually interact with people.

Frost mages in 29 are excellent, and a huge PITA with improved blizzard.

They make surprisingly good flag runners in WSG with blink and excessive snares.
---
Savage Gladiator Chain will probably not have any defense on it if we are on 1.12 patch, making Kromkrush/Breastplate of the Chromatic Flight the pre BiS chest. 
---
I still stand by what I said about stalwart clutch. It has the best defense on a belt pre raid, but really there are better belts. Defense isn't the be all end all of tanking, even during pre bis.
---
Not enough Chuck Norris references 0/10

Ah, it directly reduces reckoning's effectiveness, and can be too much defense for dungeons too. Thank you both for sharing.

I loved random portals to Darnassus. I usually had my HS on the other continent so  it was a welcome travel opportunity, I could always jump back to Eastern Kingdoms quite swiftly if needed.

Farming Felcloth in Felwood was one of the  options, or just general herbalism in that area   
---
The times are way off, a guild that takes 1 hour to do MC doesn't take 2 hours to clear AQ40.

10/10, would look at again

I've been playing other games, and all I ever think about is "This isn't WoW Classic". I've played on private servers for years and years and it just simply never gets old to me. I can't wait for it to come back and official this time.

And your reward is the useless book he wanted.

Yes? The guy even has Frost Armor on and people are clicking the portal. It's your own fault if you fall for it imo.

It does feel like a winning strategy. If a bunch of holy paladins play together I dont see anyone killing them. Should work good for flag defense and for helping the flag carrier.
---
6 demon bag only rarely gives you the felhunter, I think 10% or less, so that would not work very well, considering the cooldown 
---
Which is an off-hand with 10 armor, +2 strength and +5 intellect.
---
funny thing - the staff is actually better for a solo leveling warrior than the sword!
---
Ok so let's rate following the priorities you chose. ***In my opinion*** :
---
Compared to the other, hunter sucks for 2 and 3. Playstyle is nice but the weakest of the 3 classes imo.
---
Rogue sucks for leveling and 5 because of the competition. And for WPvP it's good but not versatile at all.
---
1-2-3-5 points are all VERY STRONG points for druid. It's also top 2 for leveling easily.
---
And for raids I mean, there are various opinions, but to me you won't have too much trouble raiding in hardcore guilds as a dps feral or as a healer even considering elitist assholes. If for tanking or as a moonkin just have in mind that super hardcore top server guilds probably won't accept you, but otherwise you're fine.
---
Anyway, with all that said, pretty straight forward choice then I think (and I've never mained druid).
---
Scarlet Monastery for sure
---
it's nearby for horde and has very good loot for lvl 35-40
---
Priests are very strong, though not as popular, at 19. 
---
This comment gave me flash backs, so many bad groups back in the day &gt;_&lt;
---
It was never a particularly popular twink bracket back in the day either. 
---
give this 100 upvotes
---
Always thought that was a wierd conformation. Like yeah I know. Unnecessary button is unnecessary
---
..Whaat?
---
I’m no theorycrafter , but doesn’t a Feral Druid bring more to the table than raw DPS?  
---
Battle Rez and innervate are hella useful, and Leader of the Pack surely nets an increase in DPS for the raid as a whole, even after factoring in a kitty’s lower DPS.  
---
And on top of that, there’s the less quantifiable benefits of being able to shift into bear form for a moment if a tank goes down or throwing out heals when needed. 
---
I don’t think druids were ever meant to top DPS charts.   But they can do respectable damage and provide excellent utility.  
---
eventually you can have 1 naxx night + 1 everything (BWL and up) else, but that is when most people already have 80% of their gear and just want to get those few missing items. 
---
I hope this will stay in the game forever
---
19 Priests with Gravestone Scepter do really well. 
---
It's almost like the entire classic community goes completely nuts over something normal and think up the absolute worst of situations.
---
At least the "content" creators all got their share of the milking from player reports before someone told them how irrelevant it is.
---
that's just nitpicking, his figures are fine, considering he rounded them up or down to whole hours. 
---
Over time people get better at games, it’s not surprising people can cut a 1.4 hour MC clear to a sub 30 minute clear.  Look at any game clear times and you’d see significant cuts on clear times over a span of 15 years.  I have no idea why everyone is surprised by this.
---
If alliance I think that Deadmines is a must. I believe that is where I got my 1st blues. A cloth chest piece, Cookie's wand, and a staff from the quest for VanCleef's head.
---
If horde then I think Wailing Caverns is a must. They have a lot of blue gear from there too and there is a main quest that also gives blue items.
---
There are also class quests that go through dungeons that I feel should be necessary. Even though not required I feel like it is good to do for immersion sake. At least in my opinion.
---
But honestly, I plan on doing every dungeon that I find quests for.
---
You seem to know your stuff, are you leading a guild?
---
One of the highest dps twink classes while being almost unkillable
---
I never said they didn't plant for post-launch content. I said that's ALL they planned for. You can go back and re-read my posts.
---
Again, don't put words in my mouth. I literally said the opposite and now you're saying I didn't.
---
Again, don't be petty.
---
Also, the model of game + expansions wasn't the norm like it would be TODAY. This was 15 years ago. They had planned for content/dungeons - just not expansions.
---
None of this is speculation on my part - this is what Blizzard said. This is what they had planned. Watch any history video of WoW and I'm sure you'll see the interviews with the original dev team. 
---
Since you are so hell bent on taking what I say out of context and literally saying I said something I didn't, I'll end this here.
---
You are free to go on with your 12 year old petty self if it makes you feel better.
---
I've raided vanilla for the last 3½ years and been officer for about a year and basically played in both good mediocre and bad guilds, so I think I have a decent understanding of how raid days work :)
---
Makes sense
---
Thanks for the response!  I'm looking to Druid because I want to have a fun grouping with my gf (rogue, both alliance) but I wanted to be able to still participate in -some- end game content.  I don't mind healing or flexing to heal when necessary, but I was also curious what it took to feral kitty raids (assuming you find a laid-back enough guild that's ok with that).
---
My guild that did 1 hour MC's took 4 hours to do AQ. that's a bit more than rounded. 
---
True, I really loved to explore classic dungeons, like Uldaman, Maraudon, Blackrock Dephts or Scholomance, to name a few. Also, I really loved that some dungeons had keys and you had explore other areas or make prequests because it gave a sense of accomplishment, a similar feeling I get in Zelda games when I find a new item which unlocks new areas.
---
My strat with making a warrior has always been to make a easy to level character and bring them to 60. Then use them to bankroll a bunch of gear/consumables/enchants for leveling your warrior. Even with a full blue gear warrior with all kinds of scrolls and alchemy pots and crusader. . . it's painfully boring. You'll start attacking a mob and probably get enough rage to use 1 mortal strike throughout and that will be maybe 15% of the mobs health. The rest just comes from you auto attacking. You can use hamstring kiting for efficiency and a little fun but it's seriously the biggest drag. But if you're willing to torture yourself to 60 it's very worth it. I personally wouldn't roll warrior as my first toon but lots do. 
---
I agree with you.    I have played in 2005 and also a lot on private servers in the past few years and I might have a viewpoint not everybody has, as I have been both in a hardcore speedrunning, server first competing, elite guild and also in more casual guilds.  The difference between those two was huge and the casuals guild certainly  felt a lot like my 2005-2006 days. while the hardcore guild did everything at least 3 times faster.  
---
For me this is a pretty good argument  for the case that the good private servers are pretty accurate these days.   BWL  and AQ40 progression felt the same as in 2006.  (In the hardcore guild we cleared Aq40 a few hours after launch, in one try, beating out the next guild by like 4 minutes....  In a casual guild (same server, same scripts, same everything) we wiped for weeks on Twin Emperors and almost 2 months on C'thun.   
---
What he said about progressive items and the content timeline has me worried though.
---
Gnomer is also necessary as a physical do’s leather. Trip runners are good for ~20 levels.
---
Agreed. Laugh it off and pay more attention next time. 
---
I'm not being petty, you're being incredibly dismissive by bringing up facts that have nothing to do with what I'm talking about.
---
&gt;Also, the model of game + expansions wasn't the norm like it would be TODAY. This was 15 years ago. They had planned for content/dungeons - just not expansions.
---
What are you talking about? This was 2004. Everquest was on its 7th expansion pack by the time World of Warcraft came out. Ultima Online was on its 6th expansion pack. Dark of Camelot was on its 2nd expansion (its 3rd expansion would release one month after WoW) 
---
Expansion packs were completely the norm and were expected by the time WoW came out.
---
False reports are already bannable and it's not stopping people from abusing the system on retail currently. They need to make chat mute require human review. Chat muting in retail is no big deal with LFR and and dungeon finder tool but it's unacceptable for vanilla.
---
One thing I miss about WoW addiction is I would stop reading the news completely until unsubbing. The "morning news" becomes the guild forums, server forums, WoW forums, planning quests or BiS dungeon runs for the day.
---
Lord knows we could use that right now.
---
What if you dismiss the pet while it's kiting the whole instance? Does the hunter get auto aggro or do the mobs get reset if nobody else pulled aggro?
---
Have to ask, at what point will you turn back to pservers if at all? Sharding throughout the game? Cash shop? 
---
I am interested to know where pserver players ‘draw the line’.
---
That's why I prefer TBC as a mage .... invisibility :)
---
That's easy:  MC in 40 minutes, BWL in 1 hour, rest of the evening  AQ40.   
---
Note :   this is with skipping as much trash groups as possible, and also  note:  these aren't even the fastest times, just swift times.  For record breaking times you can subtract another 10-20 minutes from MC and BWL.
---
Loot is also mostly skipped, as these types of guild know what people need and who gets what, so no bidding or bickering is needed, just one guy checks it and assigns the loot to the right person, if it's worth it, and the rest gets disenchanted
---
Interesting concept as it is, that is not cookie cutter pvp daggers build. There are two cookie cutter dagger builds:
---

---
Seal Face/Vigor: [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fhebRxzAoGcZV0xM](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fhebRxzAoGcZV0xM)
---
That's one mcp for every 3 try when you tank the boss or offtank the first target and mainly for progression week. That's not that much especially compared to what you would need to do as a dps druid to compete.
---
Yeah you sorta caught me being fixated on the mountains, I just vividly remembered them from classic with their distinct striped hues. That being said, "it doesn't fit the Barrens at all" it just false. Seriously, just look at a pic like this one: https://cdn.gamer-network.net/2018/usgamer/WoW-Classic-Impressions-Shot-(6).jpg
---
I’m not a fan of 19 &amp; 29 Mage twinks. They’re just too squishy. 
---
Better than Tauren Paladin. 
---
Don't you have to be out of combat and within range of your pet to dismiss in Vanilla? I could be 100% wrong as I never huntarded in Vanilla... But I think I remember hearing something about this... 
---
The more time you spend preparing outside of raid the less time you will actually need during raid time to clear. Getting 40 people together and online at the same time with all their consumes is a major pain in the ass, someone is always late or has to leave early or can't make it. This means every second spent together is a valuable resource. To make the most of your time you want to be full on worldbuffs+consumes. This will allow you to clear all the raid content in a quick and efficient manner and allow more time for farming. You have all week to farm mats for consumes and you can do it all at your own pace.
---
Without cross realm battleground, 49 bracket will most likely be dead anyway.
---
Indeed. 
---
For me. It's sharding for sure. Nothing ruined the game more than sharding. I am fine with the cash shop, lfr, lfg, etc. But sharding ruined servers!
---
Zero mobility, super low damage, but with that mana paladins they would just never die.
---
Amazingly good strategy to literally bore the horde to death, never mind the fact alliance already love to turtle for HOURS in WSG as is...
---
...I would honestly just afk out. It wouldn't even be worth fighting them.
---
*YOOOOOOOOOO!!!!* It's your **3rd Cakeday** Xaine25! ^(hug)
---
I'll also add that dungeons can be really beneficial for some professions as well. Specifically, tailoring and enchanting do pretty well from dungeon running vs questing just because of the amount of items to disenchant and the cloth gained. There will definitely still be material farming required at level 60 to get both professions to 300, but the materials gained from dungeon running will definitely help out!
---
&gt; Why private server heroes were reporting bugs in the demo that werent bugs because private servers got warlock pet summoning wrong.
---
Things like this are 100% going to happen when classic launches and it's going to be very interesting to see.
---
As a player in both 2005 and 2013 onwards, I was very surprised by this, but it really is true.
---
The biggest change is, even casual guild on servers always use (some)  World Buffs and as soon as people are good at Not Dying those make a HUGE difference.  We also use more consumables.   this all snowballs together towards great increases of speed,  people don;t die, the damage output is 30-50% higher (buffs are often multipliers, and combined add up a lot) less healing needed, so a few more dps spots, even more dps,  fast boss kills, fast trash kills, less time wasted on mana regeneration, etc etc. 
---
another factor is that we skip a lot more trash packs than we did in 2006.  
---
100% had to be in line of sight to dismiss. 
---
Classic WoW will have cross-realms BGs.
---
It looks like a fucking weeb ass gundam lol.
---
smh nah thanks fam.
---
I was once part of a 10 mage wsg. 10 mages casting the same spell was insane. Wish I still had  a video of it. Lost all my footage to a hard drive crash as well. 
---
Keep in mind it will be the 7.3.5 API with the 1.12 data, so some of the scripts and macro options may be different.
---
Okay actually fixed now buddy. Thanks again.
---
He confirmed that it does require human review, the squelch is there until that has been done.
---
Making false reports in retail and getting your account banned isn't a big deal. You can just get a new account, buy a boost and get back on track within a week or two using catchup mechanics. Getting your account permanently banned in Classic will be devastating, losing hundreds of days of /played with no way of catching up. And what do you get out of it? Getting somebodys chat priveledges removed for a day until a GM detetmines it was a false reports? Sounds like a terrible deal. 
---
really?  I always felt like dual wielding was more fun and killed things faster in the early 20s level range.  
---
Zul Farrak for the carrot on a stick trinket is quite important. I like to pick that up for the travel speed boost. 
---
BRD when you hit 51 is worth doing as there's so much going on there. 
---
None of the others seem too important but are a fun way to level and meet other players.
---
I would actually only SM and RFD for rogues, Warriors can skip RFK if they have help with the whirlwind weapon quest, and then only maraudon is actually worth it for the weapon quest and occasional drops.
---
If you are looking to speed level or catch up to friends, I would just say skip these instances until you get to your mid to low 50's where you can start running DM and BRD.
---
If you are looking to say, get city rep from quests for different racial mounts at 60, or playing with friends and not trying to speedrun to 60, they are fun and offer a good alternative to grinding -- assuming you have all the quests lined up to complete for said instance you are doing to make up for the generally low xp per run.
---
LFR and LFG is just as bad as sharding.  At least sharding to disburse players the first week or two has some merit.  
---
Don't when he said they are playable what he fails to mention is that druids are playable. If you intend on having no life outside of wow. A feral can work but to make it work costs tons of money and time investment.
---
UBRS PTSD
---
I already accepted that there will be 1.12 itemization, no spell batching, 2000-4000 player population and 40v40-120 will not be possible on blizzards servers. 
---
I will still play classic, but for how long i dont know. Im gonna miss the huge private server population, playing with people all over the world at different timezones and the fact that its actually 1.12 client with all the tiny quirks/flavors/glitches.
---
If it has sharding at max level or cashshop with wow tokens i probably wont even bother playing.
---
Agreed.  Not sure why people are being apologetic for the mage.  Sure it's a funny video but at the end of the day it's screwing over people in little ways, whether it's lost AV badges, Lost Honor, time spent trying to get back from wherever the mage ported them.
---
Yes they are people who aren't paying attention. Want to know why?  Because you're pretending to be a warlock and summon.  Naturally the people who are coming to help "click to summon" are actually TRYING to be nice.  Think about that.  Random people running by in AV who could be farming HK's or what-not, are stopping to help summon someone that they don't even know.
---
What's their reward for their trusting (blindly trusting, but still trusting at it's core) behavior?  A troll sending them to Darnassus.  
---
At the end of the day, he's trolling:  Trolling is disruptive behavior. Disruptive behavior in the EULA is a suspendable or bannable offense.
---
The community here fails to see that it hasn't been a problem on retail, and retail has the biggest world first races ever due to streaming. It wasn't gonna be the problem that some content creators made it seem.
---
"As you dig into it" 40 levels later :P
---
Loot drama with loot council is way worse than with point systems. DKP is a flawed system because of point hoarding but EPGP if set up properly is genuinely balanced and fair. Nobody is ever getting screwed with it. Loot council ultimately comes down to a human making decisions. Whether the human who is denying you loot has a good reason to deny you or not, it feels bad when it's coming from a real person. However when the point system is deciding who will get loot based off time put into the guild divided by how much loot they've received and everyone is getting their fair turn at big powerful items it's hard to complain.
---
First of all the gearing process is a bit arduous.  
---
The following items are a pain to acquire or farm:
---
1. Slaghide Gauntlets of the Monkey from LBRS. The base has approx. 20% drop rate while the specific suffix is a 1 in 18 chance.
---
2. Atal'ai Spaulders of the Monkey. The base has approx. 7% drop rate, and I think it too has a 1 in 18 chance of rolling the correct suffix.
---
3. Breastplate of Bloodthirst. Requires you to obtain a Pristine Hide of the Beast from the Beast in UBRS. Approx 2% drop rate. Problem is, most farming runs stop at Rend Blackhand.
---
4. Manual Crowd Pummeler. Obviously it's bad for mitigation, but the TPS it provides is too good.
---
5. You need exalted with WSG for shoulders.
---
6. You need exalted with AB for leggings.
---
I love WoW. I've played probably 20k hours of it if not more. I seriously regretted rolling a Feral tank on a private server a while back because I had a million things to do but not enough time to get it all done. I needed to:
---
1. Sort my resist sets (FR, FrR, NR)
---
2. Farm my pre-raid BiS (Atal'ai Spaulders, Slaghide Gauntlets and Hide of the Beast took 2 months)
---
3. Level professions
---
4. Get my epic mount
---
5. Farm consumables
---
6. Grind PvP rep
---
7. Raid three times a week
---
8. Help other guildies in dungeons
---
9. Farm Argent Dawn rep
---
10. Other rep grinds
---
It was the most insanely stressful thing I've ever done in WoW. I was seriously STRESSED OUT, trying to extinguish fires that kept on popping up every step of the way. I never had a moment when I felt like everything was under control and I wasn't too thinly spread in all of my time spent playing that character. A small part of the problem was that I was playing catch-up since I had started a short time before Blackwing Lair launched, but I was really only about 4-5 months behind so it's not like if I'd had a little bit more time the task would have been less daunting.
---
I would DEFINITELY NOT recommend playing Feral tank if you have aspirations of progression raiding as a Feral unless all of the things I just mentioned sound like a good time to you. For me personally it was stressful and felt like unpaid work. I was actually so glad when my guild decided to stop raiding and deal with real life stuff in preparation for Classic because I could not handle it for much longer.
---
MCP is bis. Often you use a feral off tank for the extra threat not for the tankiness and therefore MCP is advancing that strength.
---
Guilds won't clear "everything" each week.  Once you're in AQ you won't be doing MC/Ony, might even be done with BWL.
---
Easily the best post I've seen here so far.
---
As Horde I'd do everything except Dm and Stockades for obvious reasons.
---
Just find a mature guild and this won't be an issue jeez. Raided with my SO in TBC and wotlk, guild wasn't full of teenagers so it was fine.
---
1. It depends on the class.  Something like a Warrior, which is much more effective in groups, I'd rather do as many dungeons as I can.  Something really grindy I'll try to get dungeons when I get to them instead of focusing on them.  It also depends on how easy it is to find a group.  Tank, healer, or mage?  Easy.  Hunter or Warlock?  Take it when I can find a group.
---
2. It depends on the gear.  Wailing Caverns as horde has a quest reward for an insanely good caster staff.  To be level 18-20 and have a staff with 7 Stam, 7 Int, 7 Spirit is amazing.  On an alliance rogue I'll run deadmines over and over again until I can dual wield cruel barbs. (And ideally have the full defias set and cape).
---
3. It depends on the quests.  There's a reason I mentioned WC for horde and Deadmines for alliance (although ideally I'd do both on both).  It also depends where I am.  If I quest in Barrens then I'm more likely to do WC than if I quest in Silverpine.  I'm less likely to do Deadmines if I go the Darkshore route.  However, some dungeons the quests are really easy to get (like the SFK quests for Horde are basically on the way to the dungeon).  
---
4. It depends on how quickly we can get a group and get there.  Unpopular dungeon?  Even if it's on I like, I may skip it, because it will take too long to find a group.  (My friend and I would trick people into running Gnomer back in TBC).  Or a dungeon that takes a while to get to, like SFK for alliance characters that have never been north of Ironforge, it might not be worth it.
---
5. It depends on what else is going on at that level.  If I've got a ton of quests already and a new zone, I may not bother.  But if my only option is a zone I'm just a bit low for, or a new zone where I have to do all the gray/green quests firsts in order to open the 5 quests that are my level, then I may skip that zone and do a dungeon instead (or just grind).
---
With all that said, I do dungeons as often as I can.  It's more fun, it engages me in the game more, and I almost always get some useful piece of gear.
---
Is reckoning worth it for tanking? It looks so complicated to understand and make profit out of it
---
Thanks for the correction:)
---
Hey guys!
---
This video has been requested for AGES and I finally got around to doing it - How to get the UBRS Key in Classic WoW!
---
The Seal of Ascension is not only a great item to have for gearing purposes; it's also a great way to make money while selling  key services. Hope you guys enjoy this one!
---
\-Tips
---
P.S.  The Seal of Ascension can be used during the Blackhand encounter to summon Vaelan during the fight! Vaelan can heal you or help attack Blackhand depending on what stage the event is in!﻿ 
---
Agreed, warlock is the most complicated and engaging class to level if trying to be optimal.
---
Warlock DoT power spikes have some pretty interesting consequences on optimal rotation while leveling. Corruption, curse of agony, and immolate all get a new rank every 10 levels resulting in big power spikes even at high levels, but at low levels the difference is insane, the level 30ish ranks of the DoTs are almost twice as strong as the level 20ish ranks for example.
---
The idea of “worth it” seems flawed without any context. If you’re min-max speed running, they’re unlikely to be worth your time. If not, they’re a lot of fun and great nostalgia, which will be why I’m playing Classic to begin with. 
---
I plan to run everything.
---
can you share your evsicerate macro syntax please?
---
No.
---
I don't think LFG and LFR is as bad as sharding because you are still interacting with people on your own server, so your reputation still follows you everywhere. 
---
Would it remove people from the open world? Yes. Would it disturb the economy in flight path cost? Yes.
---
Would it take away the vanilla experience of traveling to a dungeon which requires you to actually know the world of Azeroth? Yes.
---
Would it make it both easier and faster to get into a dungeon? Yes 
---
Would the convenience of quick que dungeons bring more players into classic? Possibly.
---
Trust me, I don't like LFG or LFR as much as the next classic fanatic, but I would put up with it if I had to compromise. I think that this question in particular deserves it's own thread since it falls in the realm of "what ifs", which I hate discussing, but would make an interesting topic to see what the demographics look like.
---
I sort of wish they would release without the connecte flights just so people get to experience it. Like trying to fly some place and realize your point doesn't go there and have to fly back. 
---
I assume we won’t have the LFG feature, but it probably would be nice for grouping outside of chat. No interest in LFD/LFR obviously.
---
I think I’d prefer they add LFG custom groups. It’s automatic LFD and LFR that destroys immersion. LFG is just an improved way of grouping beyond spamming chat.
---
absolutely.
---
I agree completely.
---
Blizzard is talking about trading BoP items because they do not want to deal with tickets asking for loot fixes, but honestly I think they should just drop the entire and make it clear from the beginning that they are not gonna solve miss loots. It's really that simple and the community would like it much more.
---
He better have them goblin jumper cables.
---
Blizzard has gotten a lot more relaxed with permabans in recent years. Call me crazy but it might have to do with dropping subscriber counts. Regardless of the reason I seriously doubt they're perma banning people for false reporting. These are paying customers after all and blizzard wants to continue to profit off them. So how long do they actually get banned for? A day suspension? Two days? A week?
---
Let's say I'm a casual player who plays with irl friends and someone won an item in a 5 man from me. A rare item with a low droprate that you could go months of farming without seeing like ironfoe. They won it fair and square by need roll but I don't care I'm pissed so maybe I convince my buddies to take a week ban to mute the guy who took my ironfoe. Now let's say that guy who's muted was a Guild leader and now he can't advertise in tradechat for his raid later this afternoon until officers come online to help him. This is the exact sort of thing you can expect to see on a large scale unless you appropriately punish players who abuse the system. I just don't have faith in blizzard to permaban paying customers though.
---
So what is the solution? Require human review for the mute aspect. It's really that simple.
---
Can they? I don’t play retail so I thought they were the same as regular paladins.
---
Back during MoP there was a guild on sodapoppin’s server dedicated to ganking streamers (and very frequently soda himself as he was a big name). 
---
He’s managed to survive playing high pop pvp servers while getting ganked at every turn on top of being killed on sight when he was playing on pservers. The people thinking the ganking will stop streamers are wrong. 
---
And then there’s Asmongold that thinks stream snipers should be banned like PUBG. 
---
You'll have to choose between 3 speccs. The above one might be the best if you're 90% tanking and 10% healing. 
---
If it gets more evenly distributed you can also go 20/31/0 and if you are healing more than you tank and/or you do want to raid (you will also tank dungeons fine) you can also go with a 30/21/0 spec. 
---
The last specc actually makes a pretty decent raid healing specc where you can be the assigned pally to put BoS on the tanks.
---
Just my 2 cents. 
---
Tank: hunter, pls turn taunt off for pet
---
Hunter: taunt is not on
---
Tank: (3 pulls later) pls turn off pet taunt!
---
Hunter: I told you taunt is not turned on!
---
Hunter: (2 pulls later) oops. I guess it WAS on! Sry :)
---
I never did any of those things, just played retail "normally", yet I have enough gold to pay for almost one year of sub.
---
Is there a reliable source for that?
---
My best friend and I nearly exclusively level our alts as duos and primarily go through dungeons.  The basic tactic is this (on horde, similar but with different details for alliance):
---
1. Level a character to 12
---
2. Get the RFC quests.  Now we have the flight points for TB, Crossroads, Camp Taurajo, Orgrimmar, and Undercity.
---
3. Level to 14 (if DPS) or 16 (if tank or healer) and run RFC.
---
4. Get the WC quests.
---
5. Run RFC until level 16-17, then level to 18-20 in Barrens.
---
6. Run WC for quests. 
---
7. Run Deadmines for experience and gear.
---
8. Keep spamming those dungeons until level 23-24 and then do SFK.  The quests are on the way, so we're good to go.
---
There are a ton of dungeons in Vanilla.  You only need to run a few before you're ready for the next one.  I could be wrong in exactly when we'd start, but if you get to these levels you're usually good to go:
---
* 14-16 for RFC
---
* 17-20 for Deadmines
---
* 18-20 for WC
---
* 22-24 for SFK
---
* 24-26 for Stockades
---
* 24-26 for BFD (maybe 26-28, that one tends to get camped by the other faction on the server I'm on so nobody does it)
---
* 28-30 for RFK
---
* 28-30 for Gnomer
---
* 30-32 for SM GY
---
* 34-36 for SM Lib
---
* 36-38 for SM Armory
---
* 38-40 for SM Cath
---
* 38-40 for RFD
---
You can see it's not entirely perfect.  There's some gap from RFK/Gnomer to SM Lib, and SM GY does NOT fill that gap at all.  SM Lib and Armory will take several runs through in order to get you up to RFD/SM Cath.  In those cases, you can either grind the dungeon, grind mobs, or quest for a bit before going back.
---
The factors that have really helped me and my friend are:
---
1. We typically have one or both of us as a high-value role (i.e. tank and/or healer)
---
2. We are good at finding the quest routes for dungeons and have grown more efficient at this over time
---
3. We know the best routes through most dungeons, including maze-like dungeons like WC and Gnomer, which helps immensely
---
4. Since we are focusing on dungeons, we focus our builds on dungeons, which makes us more efficient healers (less drinking) and better tanks, and makes runs go faster
---
5. Dungeons give blue gear, so we're constantly caught up on gear.  
---
It could be a little bit faster if we focused on quests and such, but at the same time it hasn't felt slow to me.
---
Yes
---
Didn't a guild already prove the ban is automatic? We've all seen the video. That was not just a squelch.
---
&gt;The only ones not worth doing, in my opinion are Ragefire Chasm if you are Alliance or Stockades if you are Horde. But if you get to level 60 you can still do them just for fun, especially if you have stealth.
---
Think you got those backwards...heh
---
Ragefire Chasm = Horde Hub
---
Stockades = Alliance Hub

Are you suggesting the LFG tool at the start of WotLK which was essentially just an easier way to find players?
---
Agreed. Just awful. 
---
All loot systems are fair.  All loot systems can be abused by the Loot Master.  I've even seen DSK abused and that's just a queue system!
---
Is there a reason Druids seem to be the least played class in a lot of server census'? Is it a viability issue? If not,then is the demand high due to lack of them? Particularly as resto.
---
I'm more worried about my 7-4 job combined with my 4-9 job.
---
I am thinking of the current custom LFG tool. Seems like it would fit fine in Classic and streamline grouping within the same server. The problems come when you start going cross server and sucking people directly into an instance. 
---
The way M+ works now still forces people to travel to the location and group strategically. For Classic, I’d just want no cross-realm option (assuming there’s a stable population size).
---
I just said that cuz I like the sound of big dick kitty cries. I’m warrior all the way 
---
As a tank I enjoyed reminding before jump, “dismiss pets and demons!”
---
And then wiping to pet aggro anyway... 
---
It was announced during blizzcon 2017. And he discovered it 7 months earlier. And there had been work on it for a year when he discovered it.
---
Anyway, on blizzcon 2018, they said they've been working for over 2 years. So... you think you do...
---
Level 19 mages aren't very fun IMO.
---
They lack Blink, Mana shield and Evocation (all level 20 skills). It's basically just spam frostbolt/fireball and wand people.
---
A lot of decent responses here. In my situation (adult gamer, work 50-55 hours/week, no kids) I would probably stick with the apparent general consensus of maximizing value from grinding and efficient questing. I would throw in instances only when I have the quests, when the instances aren't at the other end of the map, and when there are obvious gear upgrades that would cut my leveling time going forward.
---
The above would allow me to maximize the value of my gaming time, not waste time waiting for groups that may/may not pan out and will still allow me to enjoy the leveling process. That being said, if I had a dedicated group of players that covered the main slots (tank, heals and at least one dps) I would probably sprinkle in a bit more instance grinding to increase my chances of getting the gear upgrades that would make my leveling experience a little easier.
---
wasn't it BlizzCon 2016?

love your vids! especially the deep dives, really hoping you do one for the classes before classic launches :-)

This is a reasonably concise guide to getting the seal. The emberstrife bit where it shows what it's like to MC him is useful for someone who's never done that bit before and might panic about which button to push.
---
Emberstrife is in the cave directly south of Onyxia's layer.
---
I love you both
---
Exactly. That's more a situation of worst case fear mongering than reality. I was in a wrath and cata LC and our regular members were very happy with it. Mostly because as the 3 people who discussed loot distribution we felt the need to be slightly more generous for our raiders to assure them we were being fair. It's like a benevolence handicap factor. Any too close to call items were put up to a / roll for maximum fairness. LC was very effective for us.
---
pretty sure the book is no longer available for purchase (for the time being). The plan is for John to put it up on Amazon once all the kickstarter pledges have been filled
---
You definitely get HKs even when not grouped up even as a healer. I've protected some people from ganks with nothing but spamming heals as a holy paladin and still got the HK.
---
It works on a strike system. It's not until you systematically start to abuse the system or if you group together with other players to abuse it to grief people that you'll start to suffer pentalties of staggering severity.
---
It's a good system that keeps the community clean but at the same time penalizes anyone who tries to abuse the system. 
---
It was the BlizzCon when WoD was announced, so 2013. I'm assuming you're going by the Youtube date on the popular video?
---
It's just too bad Tips doesn't belong on a show about classic.
---
&gt;or sucking the officers’ dicks
---
If that means being helpful, showing up on time, signing for raids, using consumables and doing good dps/healing, if that is to suck officers dicks, then sure...
---
All guilds will need to requite at all times in Vanilla. Its REALLY hard to have 45-50 active raiders in a guild so if they ever abuse their power then people will just leave.
---
Isnt this the guy that got a bunch of private server streamers banned from twitch?
---
:(
---
PhotekUI
---
One of the instances I'm most excited to run!  I started late vanilla and didn't level cap until TBC, so it's going to be brand new to me, I can't wait!
---
Question for anyone who played though.  I've heard it mentioned in this video and from others around the net that you can make some money selling key access.  Was this really that common?  It seems to me like asking for a few gold per party member would get you a big ol' middle finger, but maybe I'm just underestimating how few people were willing to go through the trouble of getting the key.
---
The mobs always reach you *just* when your casters sit down to drink after a big pull.
---
No. I wish it was confirmed.
---
The problem with EPGP is that it's 'fair', everyone have the same chance on loot. How will that work with people who spend a lot of time hakp the guild between raids, people who get word buffs and use all consumables and are doing optimal dps. Most pve loot will also be a cross-over between pvp and pve so how do you spend credits for that? SOme Tier gear is pvp for some classes and pve for others. Some gear a healer may want for pvp is bis for dps casters etc.,..
---
EPGP and DKP will punish the active people in a guild and reward slackers and it will create a weird situation with threat gear for the tank and pvp/pve crossover gear.
---
And on top of that, it's a lot of administration.
---
But hey, you use whatever you believe is the best.
---
Blood Elves used to forcefully take their power from a Naaru but turned to the Light like Humans and Dwarves after the Sunwell was restored.
---
Tauren worship their sun god. 
---
The lore is generally ambiguous as to whether or not all these different sources are actually separate or the same.
---
I know what you mean. I desperately refresh this page by new and hope for something interesting. Even though I feel like my life is in order otherwise, this is something I have on my mind constantly lol.. weird
---
I usually skip RFC, BFD, Gnomeregan and Uldaman. Too long, meh loots, not enough quests to make it worth my time.
---
\*Insert one specific My Chemical Romance song here\*
---
I think a lot of people forget all the other changes that happened with LFD and LFR.  I think they would be a great feature if it wasn't cross realm, didn't transport you, wasn't connected with making everything so easy, etc.  
---
In truth just an automated group maker that did nothing but build the group would not have ended up being such a terrible game ruining thing. It might be nice to keep farming while you wait for the last people to be found rather than standing in IF spamming and then all go to the instance together 
---
thats the plan! thank you for the kinda word 🙏🏼
---
9-5 is honestly the dream for raiding. You'll have the night off to raid any day of the week since most guilds have raiding days that start from 8 pm to midnight. 
---
Rank 14 is possible with a full time job depending on how well you allocate your time and how high the brackets are. Most likely as soon as Ranking is released, only the hardcore players will be getting Grand Marshal. To get it after that point will take a dedicated team that schedules times to do premade grinding. In your case of working 9-5, you would come home at 5:30 pm, farm with a dedicated team until 2 or 3 AM, then sleep until you need to wake up for work. Rinse, repeat 7 days a week.
---
Significant other would vary. If your significant other doesn't like you spending 2 hrs a night during the weekend for WoW (or any other game), you're almost guaranteed to get some flak from your significant other if you preform the above.
---
But the problem is that sometimes the tank may need dps gear for extra threat. There is a lot of gear that is only usefull in pvp and most gear is a cross over between tank/dps and healer/dps and pve/pvp. Some items are super rare and bis and other gear is junk or a tiny upgrade even if its higher ilvl. It makes no sense to use pve credits on gear that will be used in pvp only and some loot is for pvp for some classes and pve for others depending on what they do between raids.
---
There are EPGP addons for Vanilla already but ask yourself this. Why do you think 99% of all guilds use Loot Council on Private Servers?
---
Its really easy to run a LC guild. No signup needed, just post on discord if you will not show up. No administration needed for anything really, loot will simply be distributed in the optimal way for the guild.
---
Hunter &gt; *, not big news :)
---
Very interesting explanation, I always wondered why it took so much time for my pet to join me after I jumped!
---
as a hunter, if you are not racing (yourself or whatever) then wailing caverns for sure, that bow from Lord Serpentis used to be incredible
---
Ele shaman isnt great in pve, pretty god in pvp tho with the burst, MM hunter is alright in pve and pvp but you might want to dip into survival later on, SM lock is good all around but as far as I'm aware not the top lock spec for pve or pvp (I might be totally wrong about this but that's what I've read).
---
Imo with those class choices warlock would be the best fit for what you want.
---
I find them being worth it, but not in the "fastest leveling way". They especially gear dependent classes like warrior or rogue, a great weapon can go far. The pro's to dungeons are the following to me.
---
- Break from leveling. All of us usually need a small break from the grind.
---
- More quests, by running dungeons you can come back to zones a level or so higher and do them easier. 
---
- Gear. Getting good items makes it more enjoyable to level obviously.
---
- Make fwends. More often than not leveling with some dudes in SM or Uldaman translates into the late game for me when I talk to people from old dungeon runs. Sometimes even getting guild invites. 
---
Sure, you level slower in the long run but its not terribly bad, especially if you got quests for the dungeons. 
---
Ok I believe u :p
---
If they're your friends they can hopefully be trusted to not attack too fast and make your job as a tank harder than it needs to be, which is the major problem with Paladin tanks. If you don't have to deal with that, Paladins tanking is good and easy.
---

As per the [Content Creator Guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/wiki/contentcreatorguidelines), we ask that streamers remove their posts once their stream has gone offline. This stream appears offline ~25 minutes after your post went live, so I have removed your post.
---
If youre playing a hunter WC is a good one to run 1 or 2 times for a chance at the bow decent weapon that will keep you going for a while
---
If you want to outplay someone at a much higher level, a melee twink would be your best bet.
---
Hence why orc rogues are actually stronger than undead rogues, despite popular belief.
---
Quality Post is quality
---
I use one similar to that for unit frames. It’s called Archaeologist. I’m on mobile now and can’t look, But it’s impossible to find it now cause when you search wow archaeologist you just get the profession that comes up
---
I’d keep herbalism on your main and have alchemy on your bank alt. It’s easy enough to use on a second character.
---
I absolutely love these videos. I don't think I've ever seen machinima/music videos like these in any gaming community since those times. 
---
this key is a pain to get because lbrs is, generally speaking, considered to be one of the most disliked dungeons in vanilla. It’s long, boring, and depending on your class, can have little to no pre-raid BiS gear. Running it once can be a pain, but running it 5+ times to hopefully get all your gemstones is even worse.
---
I think most people rationalize that paying someone 15g is usualy worth the 5-6 hours of time youd otherwise be saving by not getting this key.
---
That said, I think the quest is dope and can be worth it in the long run if you sell keys right 😄
---
It depends on what class I'm leveling really.
---
I always skip RFC and Deadmines.
---
Ad a horde warrior or rogue I'd hit wailing caverns for crescent staff for warrior and wing blade for rogue
---
Blackfwthom Depths I'd do on all characters unless I'm way ahead in experience,  than if just do it on casters for the wand.
---
I never do stockade. 
---
I'll do RFK on all characters for the decent quests and the quest that leads to RFD
---
I always skip gnomer 
---
I'll do scarlet Monastery just for the quests
---
I'll do RFD for the quests
---
I skip uldaman 
---
I always do ZF
---
I'll do ST once I have all the quests
---
Rest of the dungeons I'll do at 58 (brd, lbrs, ubrs, strat, scholo)
---
From those ones warlock and hunter are doable, as shaman can be alright in PvP, it really has no role in PvE outside healing. 
---
The Rushmore pic is great!
---
Not level 20’s, but level 40’s could certainly kill 60’s. One of my fondest memories was fighting my way through STV with my guild and beating two level 60’s with a group of 5 40’s.
---
[Here's a list](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/8c0t4b/cutunfinished_content/) I made of everything I could find that had concrete evidence of existing during Vanilla's development cycle. Some of them are more complete than others (Outland and Hyjal are essentially done, as is Caverns of Time) but others were definitely scrapped for "better" content (the Undead got the Undercity instead of a dilapidated looking Stormwind, for example, although I think personally it would've been cool to have both). 
---
So, one *could* assume that the more finished ones would have followed Nax if they decided to go that route, but IIRC (could be wrong) John Staats said that the game was designed with the intention of expansions, and some things were cut and/or left unfinished to be put in later. 
---
I think the social aspect of running instances is often overlooked by a large percentage of the population. I've had so many great times with randoms in dungeons and ended up making a few good friends that way.
---
There should be some sort of way to keep track of how many times this will happen in ubrs...
---
Yawn...
---
I’m not gonna miss the Light’s Hope gold spammers. My ignore list fills up every single day.
---
That was totally fine. The quests in that dungeon could not be completed in a single run, and it necessitated only 2 visits if you waited until you hit 225 and later 250 before returning to the trainer.
---
What was the legion problem with pets? I quit in mid-WoD.
---
Yeah maybe, thing is the flask recipes are hard to get and you need Scholomance or BWL access to make them. 
---
On the other hand your main is more likely to have good gear and as such you can easier win wPvP duels over lotuses. 
---
Meditate on this, I will.
---
Chinese version has no bones.
---
Some people are just stupid. Not only did he not reread the post he commented again.
---
Because it’s bit like Uldir in BfA but in reverse, the horde just don’t have a particular reason to care about over arching things for most of vanilla, the horde is just trying to survive but they do have some good narrative from the forsaken’s point of view which really helps set up the story of what happens in cataclysm although this doesn’t help things much in classic. 
---
I like to do my farming on my rogue. Stealth, sap, and blind are invaluable for stealing herbs.
---
Once you are geared enough, you can bring your alt into those places with enough support. Before that point your time is much better invested in a single character regardless.
---
The class/racial and spec is a HUGE deal in Vanilla and people will spend 10 DAYS to reach 60 and there will probably never be a race change in Classic. And here you come and actually recommend people to "play whatever they want its no big deal" when in reality ITS A BIG DEAL with the fact that you are stuck with what you choose. And when you claim " Raids can be accomplished with tons of random specs and fun specs " is just a stupid comment. Sure if you want to do 3h MC farm and get stuck in ZG forever, literally forever you can "bring fun specs"...
---
Excited to watch this. Good idea for a vid.
---
Doubtful. It doesn't work like that. You'll disconnect and be unable to speak once you log in again. 
---
Icing on the stun ~~immune~~ resistant cake.
---
This may sound ignorant idk, but why does a cash shop and wow token make you not want to play? I can maaaybe understand if there's character boosts, but I dont see why realm transfers or race changes or whatever would have any affect on you. And the tokens are just for free subs I dont see the big deal in that either. I know they weren't in the original game but it just doesn't seem like a game breaking change.
---
If that’s the case, how would a Paladin of Airline be any different?
---
If you were a Beta tester you could be called a Beater like in sword art online.
---
I'll be working a 6-4 or later job. I have a lot of holidays so will be taking 2 or 3 weeks off for release. Though after that will only play maybe 6-9 a day. 
---
For healer both 21/30 holy priests and resto druids can pretty much do both with the same spec.
---
&gt;they will just claim "retail is record breakingly good" or something along those lines. Consequently i am afraid that this will lead to less effort and fewer changes to retail.
---
I don't think shareholders are dumb enough to believe this.  They'll know the increase is due to classic releasing.  Retail is still the main seller for Blizzard, despite the atmosphere on this sub, so they'll keep doing what they're doing to it.
---
&gt;Also i am worried that since the sub is shared, many, many retail players will play classic, hate it, and demand changes.
---
When does Blizzard ever listen to the players in earnest?  You think you do but you don't comes to mind.  I think it'll be fine.
---
&gt;Having separate subscriptions will lead to retail having retail players and classic will have the classic hyped players.
---
It'll also screw over people who want to play both :\
---
It is from one of us!
---
After what I heard from Ythisens we're getting an exact vanilla copy (with the exception of loot trading) and I'm fine with that 
---
I became fully erect upon watching that clip.
---
Then I watched it 5 or 6 more times just because it was music to my ears.
---
Most Guilds run more than 1 MT for 40 man content. No doubt I'll be corrected swiftly but \*if\* I recall correctly it was generally 3 for MC &amp; BWL but 5 for Naxx, for some reason. It did vary from Guild to Guild though and, of course, some of the Tanks would have hybrid specs so they could dps when they weren't needed to Tank. Multiple Tanks also gave you extra threat management tactics and made the trash consistently trivial which sped up the overall raid.
---
It reminds me the geists of Wrath. I think this may have been used in WOTLK.
---
My advice: If you can’t narrow it down to a single choice, level the classes you are interested in up to 35. By then, you have most of your abilities and it will help you decide which one you enjoy playing more. Also, the time is not wasted since a level 35 character can level their professions up to 300, saving you quite a bit of gold in the long run. Additionally, since classic servers are here to stay, leveling to 60 later than others will not mean that you’ll be missing out on content.
---
I believe his entire post was sarcasm
---
Learn to have one hemisphere of your brain to sleep while the second one is focused on WoW. Just like dolphins. Problem solve. Kinda.
---
You don’t see an issue with people paying blizzard for gold? That’s what the tokens are. You pay blizzard $20 for a token worth x amount.
---
That is a pretty big deal.
---
Cash shop for cosmetics is one thing. Cash shop for p2w is another.
---
what do you mean by 40v40-120 not possible on blizzard servers? That makes blizzard look really bad if they cant handle it.
---
I personally think, that first week is the only time its acceptable to have sharding IF they can't handle the traffic without, but who knows if they actually can do it without. Sharding to me is something that kills the whole game and simply wont even bother playing.
---
I doubt they'll change for some players who'll quit anyway because they won't be able to rush every content of the game.
---
It's more profitable to keep "us" subscribe for a long time than the CataKid
---
Mine as well if it's Daggerspine EU.
---
Well before the massive exedus to Kazzak, but Laggerspine will always be my first home.
---
I personally think, that the best solution would be sharding only on starter areas and maybe up to level 10-14 zones and then disable it beyond that. But I dont know if its even possible to apply it only to certain areas.
---
TBC iteration of off queue is best imo. Still have to communicate to find a group, still have to run to the dungeon/raid but it’s a lot better system than sitting in town spamming trade.
---
So...just like they demonstrated in the video then?
---
i never trust hunters who say that as someone who likes to tank
---
Would tanking with consecrate and righteous fury work even in a return spec while leveling? Assuming one would respec to full protection at a much higher level
---
Yeah they seem like good farmers. Never actually played a rogue though. Will be interesting.
---
You get less than half of the xp you get from just grinding mobs, and often kill less mobs in a dungeon in the same amount of time you could just grind in the open world.
---
Druid:
---
I love everything that the game offers, and Druid lets me perform each of the roles competently enough to not handicap myself with several alts. The T3 set looks amazing and I love restoration’s style of healing. Innervate, Nature’s Swiftness, Rebirth, and even hibernate are all fantastic utility options that can make running difficult content a breeze when utilized properly. I’m also a fan of night elves and I enjoy the fact that I don’t have to weigh my choice of appearance against racials that are clearly superior, something that constantly bothered me when I leveled my rogue.
---
Mage:
---
As a primarily restoration Druid, mages were always wonderful to have in the party. Free water to get us through the run, an innervate target if things were going well, solid dps, cc for nearly every pull,  frost  nova in case any melee broke away from the tank, and even a portal to finish with. The only downside was some gearing overlap with intellect/spirit jewelry and some healing/dps cloth that was superior to the leather, but even those were relatively few and far between. Making friends with a mage was wonderful no matter what content you decided to do. I’d play one myself but my friends like the class and I want to avoid stacking (loot competition) as well as personally viewing their sets as ugly.
---
Longer duration, cc immunity &gt; more damage. Who gives a fuck if your pet is big and red if I can fear/stun/root/immobilize it for the whole duration. Higher damage on aimed and multi only matter if you have the slower weapon and if you do you probably aren’t rocking BW anyways.
---
A big red lupos that you can fear ain’t shit. A big red lupos that is going to eat your face cause you can’t get away is a whole mother ball game, especially when you add in the unmitigated shadow damage.
---
You know I didn't really think about the other side of the token and actually never have. Definitely agree on that. 
---
Druid was the one class I’ve never played from Vanilla to WoD.
---
It’s also the one class that can do all three roles viably, so as a former alt-aholic it fit perfectly.
---
Uhh? Airline?
---
the main issue with lfd is it supports toxicity. Party leaders can kick without a word, for the smallest grievances. Having to travel back to city and back to instance incentivizes fixing your problems with the guy, teaching him if he is noob, or talking to him if he trolls, etc.
---
Imagine how much more dull the group experience would be without our beloved goofy hunters!
---
ALL OF THEM!
---
I gotcha. I just remember being excited and considering a druid. Until I learned how much you need to farm... Yea I'm not collecting crow pummalers to raid lol.
---
Yup, EU. Finally settled on a server in 2009, been here ever since and can't see myself anywhere else, atleast not when I play horde.
---
gnomeregan pants will carry you to 60, and you can get stuff like the underwater breathing staff and the bis gun for that level for hunters
---
That's not exactly what I said. Typically Watercooler updates (most of the time) are coming from the game team leadership. Marketing doesn't really write any of it, which I was technically on the marketing team org wise which is how I know we didn't. 
---
Watercoolers typically are coming from your Ion's or John Hight's(previously J. Allen Brack).
---
Elune, sorry about the autocorrect 😅
---
Fuck accounting 
---
I don't go super out of my way for dungeons. Most of the earlier dungeons are easy to find groups and a bunch of quests for. I've made a handful of 60s on classic servers and I feel like I rarely/ever ran rfk, rfd, maraudon or sunken temple while leveling. Not that they're bad dungeons, just never had good luck finding groups for them. 
---
They're usually fun to run with a half decent group and it really breaks up the monotony of leveling. I'd recommend going for them, just don't go way out of your way to the point you're spending a week at level 28 waiting around for an RFK group or whatever.
---
Also, may not be the best xp per hour, but running the ~55+ dungeons while leveling is worth doing if you can find a group as you'll knock out attunements and get good pre-raid gear. 
---
Most fun I had with a twink was a 39 affliction warlock with nothing but +shadow damage.
---
Hunter's disadvantage is that in the later raids their damage drops off, but if it's your friends running the guild it would work out great! There's always a job for a few hunters (maybe just one?) all the way to Naxx, so you should be able to stay raiding all the way through and Hunters are boss at PvP with basically any spec as far as I know.
---
There's always the option of joining a float pool!  That way you get your long weekends and choice of days worked
---
I just don't understand why you would wing it or deal with spreadsheets when EPGP has all the features you'd need to loot council easily/effectively built into it. You're making your life way harder for no reason other than your knee-jerk disdain for EPGP.
---
Also: I don't think you read past the first 6 words of my previous comment.

Upvoted. Rank 8 is always my goal on private servers with a massive population. I always hit it and i have this exact lifestyle. 
---
Rolls need on the staff because, "I need it for Arcane Shot."
---
What are you Thinking about?
---
Yeah I know. And so they would not be worth doing by the other faction because it would be near impossible to get there alive.
---
I'll always play retail anyway, so no. I absolutely love classic and cannot wait for it.
---
Its prob gona be easier to find that sort of guild when the official forums come out. if they ever do. Im thinking about making a Scandinavian guild with a few friends. if there is enough people on he server with interest in that. But will really depend on what kind of a population the server we end up on have. 
---
Anyways. i wish you luck :)

I once had a warlock with their voidwalker taunting mobs off me, and when I asked to please focus fire and bring out their imp, they told me their voidwalker was tanking more than me and began hellfire everything after they dotted everything up... they wouldn't even let me hit a mob before they were shooting off spells. Healer would be drinking and they'd be off pullling the next group. Pleaded that rage starvation sucks and I need to at least pull if I'm going to be tanking via Taunt and Mocking Blow Cooldown, but he didn't care. Was the only group I have ever just sat down in dispair and said "this isn't fun, this is hell, bye" and log out mid-dungeon. I didn't play for a few days after that, it was so frustrating. To be honest that moment really soured me off tanking for weeks afterwards, and it still annoys me to remember how snarky and entitled that guy was.

We have no idea how Elune works or if all these different entities are the same or not. Elune has recently been shown to be able to empower Night Elves with darkness to become Night Warriors, extremely horrible and edgy post-Metzen Blizzard writing aside. 
---
The level brackets are a bit off, I'd say WC is the real equivalent. 
---
DM = RFC 
---
Stocks = WC 
---
He was doing his job. He also was open to discuss cases. 
---
But you could command your pet to stop and not keep running towards you. So it's somewhere in the dungeon and gets killed. Do the mobs get out of combat then or aggro on the hunter?
---
Negatron, if combat is entered it is not left until broken by wiping or feign death/vanish.
---
People like strawmanning and exaggerating on the net
---
Well, I would call out name changes and realm transfers to had the biggest impact on realm and guild communities.  
---
And I do not want those "features" to destroy my lovely friendships and rivalries.
---
If you want to raid and be viable in PvP a SM specced Warlock with gear is strong.
---
Don't let people like that get to you.  If they want to tank the mobs let them.  After they die 3-4 times maybe they will stop or maybe they will leave.. you can't control others but don't waste your effort trying to help them if they don't want it.
---
Yeah but both Stocks and RFC are short instances inside of their faction's capitol city. Both Deadmines and Wailing Caverns are longer, more interesting instances in a zone adjacent to the zone containing that capitol city. It just so happens that the order in which you do each instance is flipped for the two factions. I still feel DM has more in common with WC and Stocks has more in common with RFC. 
---
Yep same I try to do all of them, maybe twice.
---
* Best thing about the dungeons is any items you get from bosses or quests make solo questing (or pvp) that much easier.
---
* Second best thing about dungeons is the XP you get from mobs and quests helps to balance out any potential "deadzones" of quests and experience.
---
And then there's the great benefit of meeting folks on your server for the first time, and then running into them again a few levels later, until maybe you join guilds together.
---
Doing dungeon runs is very good xp (better than any solo questing) if you have all the quests and a non retarded group. Doing a couple more runs when you're at a good level for it with a good group for some extra drops/xp is not bad either (but definitely slower than solo questing). But that's an entirely different thing to grinding solely through dungeons, which would mean spending quite a lot of time doing dungeons when they're green or orange to you which would be extremely slow, even with a good premade group.
---
No matter the class, you can't do a perfect template that fit both pvp and pve. You'll be lacking something.
---
Think of it this way. If tokens are in WoW Classic, then a player is able to get an edge on other players and the environment from his real life financial situation. Want a better weapon or armor? Buy a token and browse the auction house. Want your epic mount sooner? Get a bunch of tokens. Think of the consequences when it comes to WPvP. Or world first records? Or instanced PvP.
---
 Now its not about who is the luckiest, or skilled, or dedicated, or committed or knowledgeable, But about who is the most able and willing player to sink real cash into their toon. 
---
That's a pay to win model and a game I have no interest in playing.
---
It's the model from the first character select screen.
---
I asked him on twitter and he has plans to put it on Kindle too.... I hope.
---
No you aren't gimping yourself by playing alliance. Not even a little. Racials aren't make or break but I do recommend gnome if your focus is PvP, escape artist is very good for keeping distance as a mage.
---
As a general rule of thumb horde racials &gt; alliance racials, but paladins &gt; shamans. How much this matters depends on your class, and how much you value world pvp vs pug bgs vs premade bgs.
---
lol that bubble-herb
---
If you’re a mage it doesn’t really matter if you’re ally or not. You’re going to have more stuff to deal with like fears, but it’s not that big a deal. If you were going warlock or priest on alliance for PvP you would have a much bigger problem. In short it’s not that big a deal if you’re pvping as an alliance mage, and I would say you do you as far as min maxing. Racial abilities give an advantage depending on the skill of the player. Go play your human mage and kick some ass.
---
Gnome is not as usefull on mage as it is on warlock or warrior, because you have more mobility to begin with, with blink,  but still the best by far. Anti-root/snare is a powerfull tool. Plus you have almost no use of spirit in pvp since you won't be running mage armor.
---
Actually i think mage is more powerfull on Alliance since you don't have to deal with a undispelled blessing of freedom.
---
In the end, i don't think racial matter that much faction wise, it's more about elem chamy + wf totem vs pal, that's the point of imbalance.
---
SM
---
Yeah I guess it depends on the criteria you're evaluating it on. I also wasn't big on Horde so I don't know what the quest loadout was like for WC/RFC
---
Play human mage if you want to. It is all up to you. Escape artist is great but humans also have Perception which works great too. Also humans gain rep faster so you can get your PvP rewards faster too (at least I assume that is how it works).
---
I've done PVP server with both factions.
---
The real reason you're gimping yourself by playing ally on PVP is that the players with the most commitment to PVP roll horde. It's not the racials; it's the players who chase the slight WPVP edge that the racials give. Those are the players who are going to make you miserable throughout your leveling experience and murder you every time to run into BRM.
---
IME alliance on PVP servers has a big dose of people who don't actually want to WPVP. They rolled on a PVP server for some other reason like population or BG queue times. They will not help you control territory or recover from a corpse camp. They will not be going rambo in the landscape thinning out your competition for quest mobs. Instead they'll be bitching about gankers in /1 and doing cutesy emotes at every horde they see hoping to be left alone.
---
If you're actually interested in WPVP, roll horde. If you're not, go to a PVP server. The third option is to serve as "content" for the more vicious set of players.
---
&gt; after the population goes up as well as sub numbers rising, they will just claim "retail is record breakingly good" or something along those lines.
---
Nah.  No way they don't have analytics on what servers and activities people are spending their time on.  They'll know to the dime how much profit is coming from primarily retail VS primarily classic players.
---
&gt; many, many retail players will play classic, hate it, and demand changes.
---
Almost certainly.  That's where we have to trust them to hold fast.  I don't think they will screw it up.
---
Why? People have the right the be dumb and get tricked like an idiot. It's not that hard to tell a mage and a warlock apart.
---
What's sharding? If there is a cashshop I'm off to pservers
---
Yes. Absolutly! Well, it's a dick move in AV, cause yuo're only weakiening your own fraction, but hey. JUST READ to not get fooled!
---
Or if you PUG a 5 man and half the group doesn't speak good English.
---
Can be funny though at times.
---
I agree with you. When LFG finder came out the game died to me. It took a ton away from the community
---
People just worry about playing Alliance warlock since there are so many undead on Horde side.
---
Idk if it's really a big deal.
---
There is just something appealing about having to make your own group.  Needing to make friends, remember guilds etc.
---
Dat windfury though 
---
It should be possible to apply to certain zones only(I'm a Dev, not a WoW dev though)
---
wait, it'S been THAT long?
---
Gods, I'm so old...
---
... but ...
---
Good point!
---
that staff in particular has solid stats and damage at the level (7 spirit goes a long way for a warrior!), but also generally 2h will perform better as a whole.
---
 a slower weapon speed lends more freedom in movement while maintaining the same dps and allows you to more effectively use hamstring to keep your hp up longer. also, dual wielding passively lowers your chance to hit an enemy. that will lower the amount damage and rage you're generating.
---
ive seen some people talk about running dual wield to get more overpower procs or whatever, but i cant imagine it makes up for the downsides. 
---
Currently playing a pserver to level 60 just to have everything fresh in my mind once the servers come out.. And so far it's so nice. 
---
Some of the early dungeons are crazy, too.  WC has a set with like a 6 piece set bonus.  I've always wanted to try to get them all, but by the time you've run it enough you'll likely have out leveled it.
---
I think you think shareholders know more about blizzard games then they really do. 
---
In my opinion, anything that naturally or easily gets you a lot of quests. You can get several for RFC &amp; WC. There's a couple instant quests for SFK. RFK can be good &amp; isn't too out there. SM is the best because of it's availability. 
---
MC is often still done for gearing alts, and for more chances at Thunderfury's.

**&lt;Guide&gt; - EU PvP Server- Alliance**
---
**Language**
---
English
---
**Guild Type**
---
Hardcore PvE Guild, with PvP Events
---
**The Philosophy**
---
We're a guild consisting of three friends with experience from the private server hardcore community, and have participated in speedruns and realm firsts in various raids. However we haven't been active in that community for a while now and instead turned our attention towards planning our own guild when the official servers arrive.
---
We're planning to be a top-tier raiding guild, with the goal of realm firsts and fastest, throughout all of Classic content. We already have a lot of preparation done, and are currently on the state where we mainly need to recruit people.
---
**What we expect of you**
---
We have some fairly high demands for those of you who are interested in joining our guild, but deem this necessary as our expectations are high. However if you don't have any experience, don't let this scare you away, we feel confident that the leadership and class leaders will be able to help you out, as long as you have a mindset that’s willing to learn. However we do expect you to put the time and dedication in the game needed to participate in this level of gameplay, and are able to research stuff yourself, in order to improve your gameplay.  
---
We also expect you to participate in events, held by the Guild during the time we wait for a release. May this be on the (hopefully) upcoming Test Servers, or meetings of some sort in the guild. We expect that when you chose to apply for this guild, you will show dedication towards it, even prior to Classic release.
---
**(Preliminary) Raid Schedule (GMT+1)**
---
Wednesdays 18-23
---
Thursdays 18-23
---
Mondays 18-23
---
During new content release we expect to dayraid
---
You can find more information over on our Discord, or by PM’ing me or another from the Leadership. We hope we caught your interest and that you're up for the challenge!

What do people think about going out of their way for the crazy dungeons? I'm looking for a fun leveling experience, so I really hope to hit up Mara &amp; ST. We're going to play horde, but it would be super fun to even do Deadmines! I also don't have a lot of experience with Living Strat, LBRS &amp; DM. 
---
This is gold
---
It isn't really worth it unless you're just having fun with it.  From an efficiency standpoint, you should only run them once with all quests (for the most part, a few require going in more than once, at that point, up to you).  I'll be playing warr and will probably run RFK 2-3x since WW axe won't be viable easily on fresh.  SM is kind of fun to run a few times since its short.  Maybe Ulda for the weapons.  Other than that its pretty much only go for pre-bis gear.
---
All the big classic streamers -asmon and soda are all going to be pvp.
---
Well, if you were to compare EPGP to DKP, I agree that EPGP would come out on top imo. I think the ideal system would be loot council using EPGP as an admin/tracking tool.
---
As for actually comparing EPGP and DKP which is the point of this thread... The main difference between these 2 is that DKP enables collusion.  With EPGP if you want an item you have to pay up for it. There's no way around it. Not so with DKP as classes/roles can collude to spend very little on certain items (tier for example) giving them an unfair advantage other other classes/roles who are bidding fairly on all drops.
---
But like I said, loot council + EPGP imo is the way to go and how most mythic guilds have done it on retail (even in BFA with wacky personal loot) for several expansions.
---
[Daily post of this album](https://imgur.com/a/Aiw6Yx3) and a reminder that launching with 1.11+ itemization is the same as launching Legion with half of the Argus gear available
---
I think that 99.9% you won't be where streamers are. Probably will keep the server popular.
---
One thing to bear in mind about getting the key is that when the gems drop they're free roll and only one person can get it. Everyone wants the gems so if you're pugging for the key it can take forever. If you're not pugging for it, chances are you're funneling the gems to a guild tank so that he has a source of income.
---
I actually like LBRS better than UBRS, but I got all the stuff I wanted from there while getting the guild tanks their UBRS keys. I only run UBRS with guild, so I don't need the key myself, so... why run LBRS again?
---
They are 20 mans
---
So, when the pet enters combat the hunter automatically also does? If only pet+hunter are in combat and the pet dies far away and hunter goes feign death, the party would survive, right?
---
Yeh that's the main reason I played classic, I enjoyed the team work and social interaction from dungeons
---
That's fair, worth keeping in mind!
---
I personally don't really have any raiding ambitions, but I do want to hit 60 and go prot.  Running 5/10 mans is my favorite part of the game, and as a tank I imagine I'll complete the key sooner or later!
---
Skullflame is utter trash compared to Force Reactive Disk. Just saying. They like are hardly even comparable.
---
That's not what blizzard said.
---
If you haven't already, I'd say, take a look at Kargoz's video on Classic WoW Duo Leveling Guide:
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YCBd1VZVb4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YCBd1VZVb4)
---
I think he has some convincing arguments for the various combos - after all, it helped me a lot. :) 
---
Honestly test all you want but you arent going to magically find a good dps build for a paladin. This has been thoroughly theorycrafted and tested for 15+ years and ret pallys are still god awful.
---
At 19, you get crapped on by hunters, and at 29, you will also get crapped on by hunters.
---
Reminds me of the time my server on Lord of the Rings Online had some psychopath who multi-boxes 6 different Black Arrows (a ranged damage monster class for PvP). Black Arrows had this brutal fire dot that was pretty OP at the time. So anyone he targeted immediately got bombed with 6 of them and you'd melt before anyone could do anything for you.  
---
I don't think I ever encountered anything that depraved in my years of WoW. Maybe someone triple-boxing three characters for some power leveling. Probably some Chinese farmers.
---
That's a very long way out my guild on the private server does all aq40 in one night then bwl/MC/ony in one. So naxx is like 2ish months away we'll for sure be 3 nights a week.
---
Outside of arena, perception is largely garbage.
---
As long as no one interacted with the hunter, ie healed or buffed him. 
---
Getting geared for PvP is a big investment. So you would only be gimping yourself by picking a faction/race/class that you have no real desire to spend that much time on.
---
&gt; Consequently i am afraid that this will lead to less effort and fewer changes to retail.
---
I really couldn't care less what they do with retail at this point, and I'm sure there are others on here who also feel this way. It isn't everyone around here, but there will be a segment that no longer care what happens to retail.
---
&gt; Also i am worried that since the sub is shared, many, many retail players will play classic, hate it, and demand changes.
---
I want to believe people are not this dense. I'm sure there will be a few. We get the endless debates on here already, 'What about this minor change I just thought up but has been suggested a dozen times already?' But I feel like most people playing Classic, especially those coming from retail, will know and understand that Classic isn't retail, and it isn't meant to be changed (in the manner of retail, not a comment on the No Changes debate). Discussing potential changes on a forum, no biggie. Demanding Blizzard make Classic more like retail just seems ridiculous. But perhaps I am being too trusting of people on this.
---
Also, why be concerned over something you cannot change? You can suggest all you want to Blizzard, they won't change the sub/pricing model they've decided on.
---
Personally it just doesn't matter to me. I'll sub to what I need to sub to play Classic. I won't play retail, whether the subs are linked or not. My only annoyance with a linked account is the tourist factor potentially affecting the server population I end up on, and I just hope that when the dust settles I'm not forced to uproot from an established group of new friends/community because the retail tourists have scattered and the economy/server is dead.
---
Ugh sounds horrible! I experienced the same during WotLK in an arena.. 5v5 against 5 elemental shamans
---
Thousand needles didn't used to be flooded though
---
&gt; You cut out a lot of the questing inefficiencies such as traveling and filling your bags with quest items, drinking/eating, contesting mobs/mechanics with others etc.
---
And instead, you replace them with the inefficiencies of waiting for some asshole to make his way from Kalimdor to Scarlet Monastary.
---
I do remember the horde just giving up, hence the GY camping :) about mobility you couldn't stop 10 paladins who all have blessing of freedom 
---
Lolz not really. They have no MS so 3 geared healers would easily heal through their entire damage output and they would literally never catch or kill a lone Druid FC. A proper premade would run over them like a speed bump. If you queue against any random team with 4 healers yes you'll probably easily win.
---
its a combination of the nature of WSG that favors turtling, and the fact that alliance just has the patience and habit of willing to draw out a WSG hours and hours in a stalemate, where as Horde will say "Fuck this, I'm out" and just hop into a different WSG game 15 minutes later and continue their WSG rep/honor grind.
---
Only a group of 10 paladins would have the insanity and patience to play in a WSG game with 10 paladins.
---
They should be able to handle big scale pvp no problem if they intend to have it.
---
From what I understand, retail shards are built specifically not to handle quite so much, this way they can maximize the number of shards to optimize the style of gameplay in retail.
---
I think for Classic, not needing as many shards, the servers will be set to carry a heavier load. I'm sure this is something they are very aware of.
---
&gt;6 years later and this vid is still awesome XD﻿
---
&gt;Posted 7 years ago
---
Ah, fuck.  That hurt.
---
Yup, Ive never been able to get the full set, most i ever got was 4 pieces. But I loved how in vanilla you could run the same dungeon 5 or 6 times before out leveling it unlike retail, where it's normal to ding 3-4 times in a single one.
---
Sure they don't know the ins and outs of the actual game, but they definitely know what classic is and how it will increase sub counts in the short term (and possibly long term based on quality).
---
The gold doesn't come out of thin air from Blizzard. It comes from another player. I'm pretty sure they aren't doing WoW tokens for Classic gold but if they did that would suck but it wouldn't be a deal breaker for me. It doesn't directly ruin the economy at least since it doesn't create gold.
---
&gt;Longer duration, cc immunity &gt; more damage. Who gives a fuck if your pet is big and red if I can fear/stun/root/immobilize it for the whole duration
---
A big red lupos that you can fear ain’t shit. A big red lupos that is going to eat your face cause you can’t get away is a whole nother ball game, especially when you add in the unmitigated shadow damage.
---
You should reread what I said. 
---
&gt;though it was granted disorient immunity
---
It already had immunity to fear/stun/root/immobilize. All the 1.9 change did was give it immunity to disorient (blind, scatter shot). 
---
&gt; Higher damage on aimed and multi only matter if you have the slower weapon and if you do you probably aren’t rocking BW anyways.
---
I'm not sure what the argument is then. My point is that in 1.7 and 1.8, you had your new talents (though bestial wrath and unleashed rage were tweaked), AND shadow damage Lupos, AND no weapon normalization. This made hunter stronger in 1.7 and 1.8 than he is in a 1.12 with shadow damage lupos. u/melon_party was making the point that hunter in 1.12 with shadow damage lupos was stronger than it ever was in Vanilla. 
---
If your point is that we should ignore the BM talents, then it seems like you probably agree with me that 1.7/1.8 hunter is better than 1.12 w/ shadow damage lupos, because it is *strictly* better due to no ranged normalization.
---
This is the correct answer.
---
While I'm not a big fan of everything event remotely gorey being replaced by bread, I actually like the non-skeltal version of undead models more.
---
Maybe I'll do a model edit to make these ones the default instead.
---
They each have 5 quests for Horde if I'm not mistaken.  RFC can be totally skipped though.  The max level for that place is like 17.  It's usually not even worth it unless you really just want to do dungeons.  WC is great, but I usually skip that too, because it takes 2 hours with a good group and even longer for a shitty one.  Shadowfang Keep is really good though and BFD is good as well.
---
I think only Tibia was around during vanilla. Even mobile phones were shit in 2006
---
I thought the teleporter was in Tanaris?
---
Not only that but it would likely cross the line into illegal if Acti-Blizzard is misleading investors about what is driving growth in one of their biggest revenue generators.
---
sharding is the technology on the retail servers where if a zone becomes over populated the characters in the area are split into different instances (or shards) of the same area.  Consensus is that this technology really breaks immersion into the game as characters will disappear in front of you and you may not keep running into the same people in the world, and joining parties will make other characters and mobs in front of you disappear.  Currently, Blizzard intends to use sharding during launch to help smooth out the release.
---
I did 51 UBRS runs on the last pserver with my rogue. Saw Dal Rends mh drop 3 times, lost all 3 rolls.
---
Paladin
---
Magtheridon US-East (PvP) had the first and most notorious multi-boxer. He was 4 POM mages and a disc/holy priest.
---
He would arcane /holy nova down SM Cath  and armory down in like 4 minutes to farm 5x epic mounts.
---
He was hella fun to play with in AB and WSG, since he could double POM insta-kill people 2 at a time, and had basically unlimited frost novas to keep melee permanently snares while he blasted people away.

this should help you
---
Hunter. You can play entirely with a mouse and a couple macros
---
Druids take jack of all trades master of none to the extreme. The only spec that is truly raid viable, resto, is pretty much objectively inferior to taking an extra priest assuming you have one druid already for faerie fire and MotW/Thorns. Though the difference isn't big and not even all hardcore guilds will care. 
---
Feral as a tank that also often swaps gear sets to DPS, decurse, or heal can also be raid viable if minmaxed to the extreme and played by a player willing to spend far more hours farming manual crowd pummelers and consumables than anyone else in the guild. But very few people are willing to be that hardcore when they could just roll warrior instead.
---
The trick is they all walk in a group of 10 and just turtle their way to the GY.

Its a setup ment to annoying the other team into quitting.

False.

EPGP, like any point-based system, is wide open to be exploited via collusion.

best comment here
---
You need to do BFD as a priest unless you want to just buy a wand from enchanting.  
---
As a Horde I'd do SFK, BFD, SM, ZF, and then all the late games ones you want.  It really doesn't matter if you want to break up the grind at 50+ with instances, because you can use the gear and quests get scarce.  You'll be spending a lot of time in BRD, DM, Strat, and Scholo regardless.  Other instances that I'd recommend are WC, RFK, RFD, and Uldaman.  Gnomer, Mara, and ST are all super duper long and groups often quit before that.  Though, you'll probably need to go to ST I think.
---
It's probably in the same state too lol
---
SM/RUIN lock checking in.  If you have good gear you will do great in both pvp and pve with this spec.  Nobody can complain in pve because your damage is nearly as good plus you can use your imp and give people more hp.  In pvp you will destroy people if you have gear.  It can be rough without gear.  If you are undergeared I recommend shadow link instead of SM/RUIN which isn't nearly as capable in raid settings.

Yes. Just like with an overarching plot in a single player RPG or tabletop game. 
---
That sounds right.  the last guild I did naxx with, needed a whole night for 6 bosses, and then another night for 5 more bosses, and we didn't even got to the last ones for months.  We didn't have enough geared people to make any progress, veterans would take a break or leave , new ones would come, but needed basic gear etc.    My Everything in one night scenario is only for top guilds on a server that both has a good population and a long timespan of naxx content. 
---
Wailing Caverns on warrior to get the Crescent Staff.  
---
holy paladins would like to disagree.
---
That should help me swap over the models anyway.
---
Too much bread for my taste.
---
Yeah but they could have at least resolved that conflict in a small way.
---
Even if it was just like a quest when you hit 60, where a major NPC said “thanks for all of the adventuring you’ve done in this new land. You’ve made things safer for the Horde as a whole.” Then gave you a reward. 
---
Or. They could have set up Ony earlier and then capped the Ony quest with some sort of “this savage land is much less savage now than you’ve vanquished this dragon that threatened us all.”
---
Most healers should be bros. A proper healer would let him die repeatedly until he learns his place. If your tanking was truly the problem the healer should have abandoned the group.
---
Of course, if the healer was friends with the guy then I could see him siding with the lock. Once in cata we had a pug tank who wasn't bad, but my guildies were well geared glass canons and would pull aggro easily no matter how much time they gave the tank. They pissed him off and he tried to / sit and veto the run until the dps stopped giving him shit. I didn't join in verbally to the drama but I admit I backed up my guys by healing them as dps tanks while the actual tank pouted. He wasn't in the wrong, but I had to back up my guild mates.

"You there, check out that noise! We're under attack! Avast ye swabs! Repel the invaders!"
---
Paladin.
---
Are you gona break your arm in 4-6 months?
---
get a gaming mouse with a few extra buttons and you can even pvp successfully with a paladin, especially if you're holy.
---
your non-dominant hand should catch up pretty quickly btw, just mind the absolutely brutal and deliberating headaches - at least when I sprained my wrist and did everything lefty for a while, 3D games fucked me up sometimes.
---
&gt; perhaps a second shorter raid night for Ony/ZG works well until AQ releases
---
Lots of guilds I've run with (retail and pserver) will add that 'optional' raid be on Saturday or weekend, especially if the guild runs with a weekday raiding schedule. 
---
And it seems like people prefer having at least two solid raid days, particularly Weekday Evenings - early in the week. I feel like the ideal days are Tues/Weds for the 40 mans, and then you can expand to Mon or Thurs for Naxx, and also have time for optional weekend 20mans with alts.
---
I don't think three days is needed before BWL comes out, but I guess the progression will be different with Classic and I'm thinking with pserver lenses.
---
Hell, I remember in retail that guilds would literally raid every single day they could get people to fill their raids - was the first time I killed Lucifron and Onyxia was just tagging along just to see the fight and they needed more Mages. These days the content evaporates before it's even accumulated.

Regrowth (downranked) can get into the reasonable mana cost range when it crits

&lt;Sanguine Hibiscus&gt; NA - Alliance - PvP    
---
Introduction: Sanguine Hibiscus is a casual raiding guild organized by vanilla veterans with an emphasis on community and cooperation. For us, WoW is a platform for social interactions and shared experiences.     
---
How we play: While leveling, we will run dungeons, share group quests, and help each other get attunements. At 60, we will establish raid and BG events on weekends (both optional). Our top priority as guild officers will be to groom and gear a consistent and comfy raiding team and make steady progress through the content.    
---
Raid loot and schedule: We use a modified version of the "Suicide Kings" loot system with separate lists for tier gear, weapons, and other epic gear. For details, visit the “About the Guild” page on our website. We are tentatively scheduling raids on Saturdays at Noon EST and may add an additional raid time on Sunday afternoon (depending on interest and pace).    
---
What we want: We are recruiting all classes and all levels of experience. If you have friends or family who are playing, they are welcome to join. All we ask is that you play the game now and then.    
---
Finally, whether or not you are interested in our guild, feel free to browse my comprehensive Classic WoW guide, linked on our website (made in Google spreadsheets). This guide includes pre-raid gearing lists, a world map, profession guides, and more (constructive feedback is much appreciated).

about a year ago i joined a pug wsg that had a 10 man ret pally premade.  they had better gear than this video.
---
the spot i got was from someone who /afk out because he was annoyed with the 0-0 stalemate.
---
i was playing a warlock and my COT/fears won us the match 3-0. woot
---
Ive grinded 34 levels as a paladin. 
---
You can do it without a brain and I may lost mine doing so
---
Pretty sure the [Prison Shank](https://vanillawowdb.com/?item=2941#dropped-by) is the only real reason (quests aside) Rogues want to go there, since it'll last you for quite a few levels.
---
prot pally is one of the worse specs in the game.
---
Not that I disagree with the gist of your post, but I think you should be using the word "optimal" instead of "viable" there.
---
its a shame they wont lower respec costs so you can raid DS/ruin and pvp nf/conflag
---
I'm okay with sharding for the beginning but after the initial hype dies I'd like it removed
---
☝️
---
Lvl 16 Grey shoulders with +17 armor &gt; any epics in the latest expansions of retail.
---
Going back to your original comment, I actually totally forgot about that carrot on a stick trinket, what a hilarious item.
---
Rushing in with world buffs a somewhat good non-hardcore guild can look at getting bwl down in like 90 mins, ony in another 30, and then MC in another hour. So yeah it'd be a full 3 hour raid night but it's very doable once a guild has been running those three raids every week for like half a year.
---
Downranked regrowth can be useful if you spec 21/0/30 (for natures grace and regrowth crit). Its a fast cast that will proc grace more than half the time and crits heal for a pretty reasonable amount for the mana cost. The hot is just a bonus here, your mostly after the 1.5 second heals.
---
True.
---
Oh, I'm of the mindset that they are not worth it even for the respective faction.  Ragefire has a few decent early greens but is otherwise an annoying "baby's first dungeon".  Stockades is higher leveled and has better experience quests, but has \*the worst\* loot for any dungeon...even ragefire.  As such I consider both to be equally bad.  But to each their own. :)
---
let me fix this for you  "if you are undergeared then i recommend you get some gear"
---
a green geared soul link lock in a BG is just wasting a spot. 
---
 i been playing a vanilla lock for years and have never used soul link even though respecs are capped at 5g for me :D
---
It’s a universal experience for everyone
---
they sell mouses that have dozen+ keys on it.
---
set your binds to the mouse and you can play with one hand.
---
Tips, I heard some people had already received their book. I recently purchased the book on the kickstarter page (I wasn't a backer). Do you think I am also among the people still having to be dealt with until the book will be sold on Amazon, or...?
---
That works on a pve server. On a pvp server, a Paladin using a one button rotation macro can BOTH pve and pvp with one hand.
---
I mean, they take you longer to get than an epic in retail...
---
I am aware it doesn’t come from thin air but you’re still paying blizzard for gold regardless of where it comes from.
---
Very true. But in my experience players will usually show up if you call out an inc (or just serendipitously respawn at the right time), so the solo defense quickly transitions into a team fight that druids don't contribute as much to.
---
From my extensive experience at the 29 bracket most classes if geared correctly are worth playing.
---
\+100k kills and maxed rep with my main 29 twink paladin, while I had 5 other 29 twinks back in original WoW.
---
Corsair scimitar was 50 bucks has 12 buttons.
---
15 minutes later. Hunter rolls need.
---
Just so you know, an affliction warlock can macro their entire rotation to one button AND include pet commands in the macro or others. So basically you can likely level using nearly 2-3 buttons outside of pet summons and some utility.
---
Answer for main question is Paladin. Hunter if only pve grind but you WILL suck at group play and pve ... near useless actually. Bad hunters in groups is a terrible experience.
---
Can’t wait for LFM LBRS Gems reserved
---
I don’t know man, have you played recent pservers? When Alliance outnumbers, they’re ruthless, too. 
---
Besides, Paladins. 
---
Sharding is a little overblown for classic. The thing people are ignoring when they talk about sharding in retail and comparing it to classic is that retail has phasing, and cross realm. If sharding is kept to just your realm you will still run into the same people, not as often as without sharding though. Not to say that sharding isn’t bad but it’s not as big as people are making it out to be.
---
Chat isn’t sharded so while you can’t see everyone on your realm you can still talk to them, and if you want to see them group up. It will be a hinderance, and has no place outside of the launch load. It won’t be quite like retail though, due to the lack of phasing and cross realm in Classic.
---
My old Guild from Classic still has a Facebook-page with members from back in the Days. Someone asked if people are coming back, there wasn't alot of ppl responding but some.
---
 In the old Days it was a Swedish/Norwegian speaking Guild on the server Bloodscalp(Horde). I hope we will be able to raid MC/BWL etc. once again together.
---
If there isn't enough ppl, I hope to join Another Swedish or Scandinavian casual raiding Guild.
---
You UBRS, yes?
---
Only dungeons with pre-BIS are required. Everything before that is just for fun and better loot to level with. The truth is that intelligently building your leveling gear with green items alone is more than good enough. 
---
I do suggest getting those few low to mid level blues (and even some greens) that last for 15+ levels of your life. Otherwise, it's smarter to just buy some cheap green on the AH for your level from time to time.
---
Yeah but he does say “while doing simple questing”
---
No joke, it turns Scholo into a freaking bakery lol
---
Yeah I hear that, the mage and healer in the group were backing me up, encouraging the guy to stop being so sloppy with his dps or at least turn off the taunt from the voidwalker. He wasn't hearing it, and kept beginning multi-mob pulls by AOE, and if he died there was some passive aggresive comment. 
---
I tried to be polite about my requests, since I've been that DPS-hungry caster glass-cannon myself, as well as a healer, so I knew how needlessly rough he was making the run. I even said that if he wanted to AOE that was great, but please kill the first mob most of the way so I can hit everything a few times... that kind of request would be thrown back in my face as if I was bad for asking him to not go balls-to-the-wall from the get-go. 20/20 says we should have booted him from the group and got someone else, but at the time it happened I was so dispirited by how this guy was acting it was an avatar-wide-existential-crisis, I just shrugged and logged out for a while.
---
I'm sorry, but I have to say it's just stupid to think retail players will "demand changes" to classic. It won't happen for two reasons, 
---
1. Blizzard doesn't allow it, they were very clear with what was classic and what was not classic. 
---
2. There are those retail players (a small minority), but a majority of them are on our side. They want classic to be classic while retail continues progressing. For many retail players classic is something fun they can do on the side for the same subscription.
---
Also.. I'm a classic player, I don't play retail anymore but I couldn't care less if they use classic WoW to bolster retail WoW's numbers and it doesn't make sense that Blizzard would just stop putting less effort in than they already do to make WoW "worse", that's weird. Having both games do great is something they want because it will drive in more revenue, easy as that.
---
As far as sub numbers, I don’t think we will ever see hard numbers again, so whatever the state of Classic vs live is is out of our reach. A combined sub is better news for Classic than not. There’s more people to potentially build the community, and there will be more noobs to make a community more varied.
---
Even if you’ve played live WoW for years, many modern players will be taken aback by many Vanilla game mechanics that have been absent in the game for a long time, and that’s a good thing. It’s no fun if everyone’s mastered the old game.
---
Yep, why just last night multiple Horde were running around killing people in SW and most everyone just stood around the bank/ah like normal. Try that shit in Orgrimmar OTOH and you get rooted out tout suite.
---
It's actually worse on pservers than it will be in classic because there aren't viable PVE pservers -- if you want to encounter other players, you *have* to roll PVP, and there's no end of crying about it from allies.
---
I really like this list, I saved a copy to my google drive. So Thank you!
---
I would like to see a 1.12 itemized version as well, since who knows maybe we will get 1.12 itemization at release. Since you have Nature resist sets, if you'd be willing to work more; I'd love to see a Fire, Shadow, and Frost Resist guide as well. As MC does require FR for certain fights and pulls.
---
And even if I don't agree with every choice for the items. In the end the choices made are still good pieces of gear. This is a great guideline for all classes looking for a quick overview of the gear they will want throughout the different stages
---
Wait you get epics before level 20 now? Rofl
---
There are few low level epics in classic. If I remember correctly you can get one at level 30-40
---
WC has a quest with a 10 slot bag as a reward - the Deviate Hide Pack. Pretty handy when leveling a new toon. 
---
If Classic succeeds, the main benefit for the industry is the proof that a SUBSCRIPTION alone can profit and sustain itself.
---
It's up to Blizzard to recognize the importance of this. Activision and it's venture capital business format will NEVER see the sub only model as a success because it can't be scaled easily to rape it's audience of their money to meet quarterly profit projections.
---
The only win for us will be if Blizzard sees that enough success is good enough for the company. It already had this control over Wow at one point in history ... then they SOLD OUT! 
---
If big developers gain enough control over their own IPs and realize profit is profit, we may see more games once again hosted and nurtured for their core audience and not just exploiting the biggest possible audience. 
---
THIS is what we need to look for. This is just a small side project if Blizzard is eternally the lackey of Activision. No active development will occur in this style of game in AAA development. It won't be a real win for those wanting niche market, specific genre gaming once again.
---
It requires two presses in Vanilla even in a macro. You can put it on a mouse scroll down or up or shift modifier macro and get it to hit near at once, rolling fast. 
---
So macro would probably be like this in the new client. 
---
/cast Berserking
---
/cast Fireball
---
Yup. Threat is all that matters in vanilla and threat is harder to maintain on Horde due to not having blessing of salvation like Alliance has.
---
You know what one of the worst feelings in WoW is? Knowing you can wear shoulders but not having any. I was around level 18 before I got my first shoulders and those few levels I didn’t have shoulders were just awful. No one said anything but I know they called me “no-shoulders” behind my back...
---
Pretty sure s/he means the time investment to get to lvl 16 in classic is greater than the time investment a boosted character would need to get an epic.
---
Private server for dreams?
---
These are the talents you need to tank in dungeons - and you can heal with them as well
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxuoxZVMtIxzxo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxuoxZVMtIxzxo)
---
I used to. I remember playing fury warrior and dreaming about sudden death procs. It’s the ultimate feeling when you get a proc randomly and you just mash that execute button. 
---
Feels good man. 
---
I've actually really come around on game time tokens after initially being extremely pessimistic about them.
---
Seeing their implementation in games like EVE and OSRS has let me see some of the benefits.
---
The biggest reason is that tokens make gold farming and selling gold illegally far less lucrative and appealing. Fewer foreign gold farmers is obviously ideal. That in itself helps trade commodities hold their value and makes more grinding options viable for legitimate players.
---
Tokens also don't just generate gold into the game, so it doesn't increase the rate of inflation or destroy the economy.
---
Ideally we'd be in a world where no one wants to buy gold in the first place, but seeing as that won't be the case I'd be fine with or without tokens.
---
The only real issue when it comes to pvp balance if when one faction becomes much larger than the other. Sadly, there is a tendency for horde to gain size on pvp servers and Ally gain size on pve servers, and if you rely on BGs to rank up, the instance pop rate can become skewed. 
---
Even on even ground, the world design had the greatest affect on where and when pvp occurs the most and what faction dominates an region most often. 
---
Typically, when you add up and the influences affecting pvp on servers, it's the cumulative effect of many contributing factors that impact the trends in pvp and not just the regular memes people continue to read.
---
I daydream all day about how it's going to be just like it was back then. Then I go to sleep, and have nightmares about how Activition Blizzard slowly squeezes out all the fun of the game by adding shadring, in-game shops etc..
---
I feel bipolar in my moodswings of how hopeful/terrified I am of the release.
---
God help us all.
---
Flex on you with their grey cloth shoulders
---
not for or against changes, but... they have a team for classic. why do you think the devs working on the game would be from modern wow and not the dev team specifically hired for classic? do they bring in diablo devs if hearthstone needs changes too?
---
Yup. They're the most fun bit of levelling. 
---
I'll do you one worse, having shoulders but having them be so small that they look absurd. Fellow male orcs who played BC will understand...
---
I don't think WoW classic is coming in the summer anymore... do to Activisions issues I believe itll be holiday season... 
---
Not necessarily classic wow but about a month ago I had a I dream I was inside Ulduar and then there was a nuclear explosion and I felt my body disintegrate and then I turned into Algalon...super weird dream.
---
They can claim whatever they want. The suits have the metrics. As far as the retail players, if anything the retail WoW servers will just get more and more toxic and awful because the normal people and people that are social will just go to Vanilla and love it.
---
All they will have left is people who want a single player MMO (they need to go play Witcher 3 and learn what a good RPG looks like), people who think a MMO should be a esport, because they failed at real esports (most people can't stand them and they have an increasingly shrinking viewership). The retail playerbase dumpsterfire will just increase WoW's falloff and then Blizzard will probably lean back to Classic design or just abandon WoW and invest in a new one that could also be on consoles for more revenue. Streamers have ZERO influence on a MMO. Some of the best streamers on Twitch are in the WoW section or have been and they bring no players to the game. People want to lose themselves in a world in a MMO, not listen to a streamer while they play a MMO as a single player game, because the game isn't a true MMO anymore.
---
Catering to streamers or bending game design to them was the biggest mistake Bizzard ever made. Especially when they made a esport game specificalyl for these people and they don't even play it (Overwatch). 
---
^^tryhard retail “mythic raider” group, checking in 
---
I would say run all of them at least once. You cant pass up on the full defias armor with a couple of cruel barbs. Also the ever so sexy herod's shoulder that made you feel like a boss. I cant wait to run these dungeons again!
---
Meeting people was the best part :) I met my first WoW friend in my first dungeon run: it was Blackfathom Deeps. I was so noob I thought I could do it alone lol. So I ventured in the tunnels before the instance and there I joined a group of 4 people who were looking for a last spot.
---
I also ninja'd my future friend's loot because I had no idea what I was doing at the time lol
---
Every weapon is a hunter weapon.
---
The squelch is automatic, followed by a GM review like Caden explained in this video. The GM review then either determines that the report was correct which punishes the reportee or incorrect which punishes the reporter much harsher if it's by a repeat offender.
---
Ohh lol. I didn’t even make the connection lol. I was like airline? You lost me!
---
No Caden explained how it worked in the video. They didn't demonstrate anything, this is just a podcast.
---
We're playing as 3. And from our exprience we never have to wait much for people. It is all about orginanising well and planning your routes and downtimes with grinding. If you fill the healer and tank spot you just find people super fast, especially if you have a nice leveling guild. It is funny you mention SM because that is an instance where you can do parts as 2-3 people when waiting for a full group anyways.
---
No. You get a boost, join LFR and get an epic from the very early into the raid, perhaps like 15 to 30 mins in. Total maybe like less than 1 hour of work. It takes longer to reach level 10 in Classic than that.
---
Cash shop/tokens and/or LFG being added and I'm right back to pserver.
---
All of the 3 seconds nukes have time reduction talents- it's the base damage that determines their spell coefficient.
---
But yes- shamans do have the fastest nuke given that lightning mastery is a 2 second cast.
---
As a rogue i remember first getting those uncommon tan shoulder pads with the defias facemask. Was basically a god.
---
Hmmm, maybe I'm a little more visceral with my teaching tools than your healer was. When in a pug, if I see a dps pulling without the tanks permission I'll let him get in the red before healing as a warning. If I know the tank is frustrated with the guy I'll let him die to help bring him into line. If he says anything like 'wtf heals?' I'll politely tell him that it's the tanks job to pull. No one just dies without getting multiple warnings though. If I let dps die on purpose, he's definitely got it coming.
---
ZF would be great if you didn't need the gong, and the quest to get the gong is like lvl 49 or something so anybody that actually has the gong isn't going to need ZF anymore. Apart from that it's a very fun instance with a lot of quests and some good drops.
---
I did this more than once.
---
Sorry everyone.
---
Yeah I hope for some more news too. I'm not saying inform us every day, but would it hurt Blizzard to do some kind of Q&amp;A let's say once per month.
---
Group PvP/BG wise you're better off on alliance, and for duels there isn't anything anti-mage about horde racials. You're missing out on the possibility of WotF by going alliance, though your PvP trinket can already break fears. Not having WotF will probably be felt slightly but no where near as much as playing horde and dealing with Paladin freedoms and Gnomes.
---
The spec that can work for the first two tiers on shaman is 30/0/21 and you don't DPS as the spec. You use chainheal where the spec isn't crippled in a melee group and drop totems.  Elemental is NEVER really viable for raiding unless you have AQ gear that bypasses resists and are doing earlier content.
---
On a shaman if you want to play Elemental you go full resto to get BIS. Do this in the 50's.
---
You then spec to this.
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hEzzVfMqZZVcIz0xo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hEzzVfMqZZVcIz0xo)
---
Why that spec doesn't work well for BIS farming? Because you don't have .5 seconds off healing wave. 
---
Once you are in AQ you are probably going to need to respec every week for mana tide. It's worth it because Elemental's best gear is there. This would be the PVP spec you go then when you respec. Mana is the biggest weakness of a ele shaman. The extra mana from the totem talent will help more than armor, which you already have a ton of with a shield on.
---

Wow that just sounds depressing xD i hope you like ubrs runs
---
A guild demonstrated that the ban is NOT from human interaction but automated. There's a video and also a video of asmongold reacting to it. A bunch of guild mates on discord all reported the same guild mate and he was insta-banned. The same video shows a pre-made BG group report an enemy healer at the start of a match to force him out.
---
If they poison the game with shops I might legitimately cry. 
---
One of the best DPS on my server in WotLK was a quadraplegic who played with a straw.
---
He was a hunter.
---
Population balance &gt; racials.
---
Was going to downvote based on the title.  But you made some good points so I upvoted instead.
---
I think you drew the wrong context from what I was expressing. To clarify, I was pointing out that blizzard hasn't provided details on classic in a long time. 
---
I didn't mean this thread to be a "what if" discussion paennel as much as I was expressing my hunger for more details on the official release of classic for is, the community, to discuss. 
---
Hope that clarifies!
---
I had a buddy in TBC that used his mouse wheel roll to set two macros, one to autofollow player name, and one for his DPS rotation. He was a hunter... And top DPS in most fights... He barely ever used a keyboard. 
---
Also those private servers have shared quest items/dynamic respawns. Without those, there's literally no point trying to do any quest in a zone with 200+ players. You just run about and try to find something - anything to kill.
---
*citation needed*
---
aka where every dal'rend I ever saw went
---
What you actually want to say is: "*People have the right to be assholes and intentionally hinder other people's ability to enjoy the game"* AKA, Griefing.
---
Fair enough.
---
I personally really like Berserking on shamans or priests to spam their 1.5 heals with, but to each their own.
---
#*Something Something Power*

#*Something Something Complete*
---
The defies mask is pretty legit
---
No you are not gimping yourself playing Ally. You are gimping yourself playing pugs with a ton of ret paladins and night elves. Alliance was always better for group pvp because Holy Paladins/Warriors are the META classes. Dwarf and Gnome racials are also extremely strong. Be social, talk to some people and make some friends and queue with a few of them and minimize the Night Elves and Ret Paladins in the BG. Find some Holy Paladins and enjoy the wins.
---
Finding a group to pvp with on a mage is easy. Bind rank 1 blizzard to the keyboard and abuse the heck out of it. You are there to spring carriers, slow down zergs, CC and annoy. When caught alone you can burst someone down, The human racial is BAD because of rank 1 blizzard revealing stealth so well and because the gnome racial is baller in PVE to. The gnome racial is especially good on a mage when you kite and can deny kiting. Yes human is a bad choice. Embrace the gnome. Make a dude to counter all the pigtails and name him princejoffrey or something. You will be legund.
---
Well it doesn't work like that. Yes you can force an enemy healer out of a BG my mass reporting him and he'll be logged out, but he can log in again but unable to speak.
---
But as Caden explained, abusing the system in such a manner will come with severe punishment on your end, something you do not want to risk in Classic. Losing months of work due to a permanent ban just so you can mess with someone's chat privileges for a day or two is a very expensive price to pay.
---
He explained just how the system works. It requires a manual review, there's no point in arguing against facts.
---
It can be rare mob or something. No point to put this model inside eu/us client. 
---
Also there also many unused buildings. 
---
This is the best meme/comic I've seen in a long time
---
The point I was making is that to even consider raiding as a rogue, youll be competing with literally 600 other players on your server for the exact same loot. Without certain loot, you wont be able to seriously raid. Rogues are fun, they really are, but you have to get either really lucky lootwise, or grind the same 5 dungeons hundreds of times. 
---
To answer your question whether the grind its "worth it", Im gonna have to say no, its not. The weapons youll get in PVE (arguably) wont be useful in PVP, unless you go some meme hemo mace build, or luck out and get the perdition blade.  So if your aim is to raid, to get pvp gear, to be able to go pvp, then dont do it.
---
Sure, you can pvp with combat swords, but itll get old quickly in my experience.
---
Note that grinding "entirely" in dungeons means you do like 3ish runs before heading to the next one or to the area where you prepare the next one.
---
For example as horde in the early levels you have RFC =&gt; WC =&gt; SFK =&gt; BFD =&gt; RFK.
---
From RFC to =&gt; WC you really only need to to the chain quest preparation and some quest around those areas to be ready for it, if you cleared RFC at the earliest level possible and to 2-3ish runs.
---
Then from WC =&gt; SFK you almost don't need to do any quests/grinding in between, so you can just pick 1-2 good quest before heading to UC/Sepulcher to grab the SFK ones.
---
We then actually just cleared SFK *once* and were already ready to head to hilsbrad to do the elite chains. You can simply do it 3 times instead again instead of going to hilsbrad.
---
Then you are ready for BFD, which is a really long instance, but has quite a bunch of quests. You can do some runs and then grab the fulborg quests and the warsong supplies.
---
Now you can already go into RFK a couple of times. After that I highly recommend some STV grinding, simply because it's really fun there and you encounter your first PvP battles and then you are already ready for SM and Gnomer.
---
After level 40ish Dungeon grinding actually becomes quite impactful because you are actually getting stuff that you will wear well into your 60s. And also now you didn't spend your first half of leveling just doing open world grinding quest, but cleared every dungeon multiple times. At this point you'll still will be wearing some of the good stuff you got out of BFD, SFK etc.

He legit just said he broke his mouse hand.....
---
Why? I was thinking it would be useful while guarding a flag in Arathi Basin.
---
yeah but there is a difference between having bad gear and being undergeared.  Undergeared is relative to where other players are.  If you are with the front of the pack you don't need to use soul link, but if you're more casual and people have some crazy gear that you haven't been able to get yet soul link might be a viable option.  If you you're all green gear in a bg you're just praying for a team carry regardless of class imo.
---
I'll keep that in mind :)
---
My experience has been similar with a more casual guild and I lvoe it.
---
Hating on private servers is the great circle jerk of this sub. My post above is getting downvoted for saying that there is something you can learn from private servers smh...
---
Yeah but how is he supposed to browse his choice of *online entertainment* with a cast on? 
---
I can see why you would say that. I think Stockades is good for farming wool cloth though. Especially if you have tailoring.
---
He's got two perfectly good feet.
---
I would buy yourself a Mouse with a load of buttons, and swap your mouse arm for the time being.
---
No no you're right. I wrote that when I had just woke up I didn't really think everything through before posting
---
I mean, Horde is hard mode -- there is no panic "lol damage immunity/snare" button for you from paladins.
---
Alliance is easier in that, but that is if you can bare playing alliance.  Gross.
---
For real discussion, I would say mage is better on horde, because shamans can ruin your day with earthshock, gorunding totem, and purge; while possibly the worst matchup for paladins are mages.  Getting buffed with blessing of protection is good against melee, but if a priest or shaman purge that it can put you into a real bad position.
---
Right
---
Neither rewards that make the game easier nor xp that speeds up my progression are goals of my dungeon running; in fact they are anathema to my fun. 
---
I realize this sounds crazy but i actually, literally, honestly enjoy the GAMEPLAY of dungeons.
---
And those stats, oughhhh those 23 Armor, Marvelous!
---
None of those examples impacts the number of raid nights per week or how guilds progress through raids.
---
True. Can't do it though! My health system offers pension and excellent health/dental/vision etc. I'm stuck in a staff position! 
---
Thanks for the insight people, gonna give rp a shot after Classic had dropped.
---
Maraudon. 
---
The most recent (North*****) every pvp group purposely rolled alliance to throw off numbers. Which really made the server awful to play aside other private server issues.
---
In general most pvp oriented players do tend to roll Horde, even on PvP servers, but PvE servers are totally dominated by alliance b/c paladins and RP.
---
What if he... uses the other one?
---
I like Trolls on priests cus of blackout off the racial to. It's just alliance dwarves that could immune DP were actually rare in real vanilla. Prob will be again to, which makes undead and a inner focus devouring plague macro just broken in pvp and lets you 2 v 1 3 v 1 with ease. If a lot roll dwarves this time that could change though. Might happen on EU as most private server players were from there.
---
Human mage is fine. As for your faction choice. Yes horde racials are better in pvp but, Shamans are absolute crap compared to paladins so it balances out till Naxx when it's play Allie or quit. The reason why paladins are so much better then shamans is pretty simple. Think about a Mage vs. Boomkin. A mage is set to do one thing agressively kill. While a boomkin trys to split the difference with hybrid power. Obviously many moons has taught us specialization beats jack of all trades. 
---
This is why paladins are way better then shamans. Shamans try to split the difference between being aggressive and defensive. While paladins pour all of their power into being an unkillable support. As time goes on that specialization far outstrips the more hybrid nature as a shaman. A Naxx geared holy paladin is by far the best healer support in the game. Followed by priest, not shaman lol.
---
Anyway getting back to your question. A human mage will be more then fine. No one will hold it against you. Believe me you aren't the only player who balks at the idea of being a gnome. They just look stupid. Unless your 16 and just wanna be ironic. No one wants to be a gnome lol.
---
Thinking about HKs... do you guys remember /inspect someone just to look up how many kills he got?
---
good times
---
Who the fuck cares
---
&gt; because healers don't need to drink in dungeons?
---
Quite frankly almost never if you are heal specced. I'am now testing Priest in a Warrior, Druid and Priest group, but at launch we'll do it with a Shaman because the synergy is higher. The Priest is mostly disc right now because I wanted to grab Divine Spirit ASAP.
---
The issue is that most ppl will specc their healer into DPS while leveling, so they can grind faster. They simply don't have the efficiency of a heal specced one.
---
Also for a majority of trash pulls you can easily drink during the pulls. You get a good feel for dungeon healing and don't have to be super ready all the time with precasted heals. Plus if you grind dungeons you and your tank are more geared up than the average quester.
---
&gt; will you just grind dungeons 10x in a row without vendoring loot?
---
No, ofc not but that you have to do anyways and you want to grab some abilities now and then too. Also our group consists of 3 ppl so we usually need to find 2 new ones. Often we just meet up, do a run and port back to town to vendor/ah/craft/learn and log out or prepare the next dungeon run with travel. Also you don't need to do them 10x in a row. You do them like 3ish times depending on the gap to the next one and the loot you still want.
---
&gt; you think you won't wipe with random groups and have to walk from the ghost healer several times?
---
The more randoms you have the more this will happen but if you have a good leveling guild you'll figure out who to bring real quick. Also the big factor in 5mans are your tank and healer. The other's almost don't matter as long as they respect the focus target mark and the fact that only the tank pulls. That is literally all they need to do. We did wipe in SFK once at Arugal if I remember correctly because we brought 2 semi-afk sleepyheads.
---
&gt; it takes like half an hour for everyone to arrive at the dungeon also.
---
That is where you need to plan ahead. You always grind open world to sync up with your group nicely, you don't just wait in front of the dungeon.
---
&gt; contesting mobs isn't a problem outside of overpopulated servers, by the way. 
---
We specifically talked about fresh servers when mentioning this...
---
&gt; i don't understand where your wishful thinking comes from, but i'm sure you have your reasons. i'm all for people having fun in whatever way they want to, but please don't deny reality. 
---
I'am testing this *right now* and it is working just fine. This has nothing to do with wishful thinking. Also again, you don't need to grind dungeons 10x before hopping to the next one. You do them like 3ish times or so in the first half of your leveling. So that is 1-2 quest runs and 1-2 grind runs.
---
Is the most over rated ability in the game and by this patch has been nerfed into the dirt. It's a meme spec. Keep in mind by this patch you can't proc a WF off a WF because it has a 3 second internal cool down. On top of that the internal cool down is so long that when you switch to sword and board which you will a lot. You can't get back to back WF on a 1 hander because of it's 2.8 second swing timer. Enhance is hot garbage a flaming hot pile of garbage. At least ret is playable (in pvp) with imba gear.
---
Or it wasnt on and tank is shit
---
Only if you already know the rogue is there. It's a 30s/3m cooldown.
---
Besides, as a mage, you should be with the team, not guarding flags. That is done best by rogue/druid.
---
That seems to run counter to prior lore, hadn’t the WC3 Huntress/Priestess hero referred to Elune as the Moon Goddess?
---
Lol what spammers?! You don't have the add-on? Your fault
---
Back when TBC came out, my RL friend got me to play with him on a RP server for a few months, because I had taken a long break from WoW. This was on a German RP-PVP server, so it might not be the same on a US RP server.
---
RP essentially means that you speak in a RPG way. Instead of saying "wasup n$%&amp;$" in gchat, you say "greetings fellow guildmembers". Instead of saying "Lfg UBRS" you say "Experienced rogue looking for a group of adventurers to kill the evil Drake Drakkisath and restore order in the Blackrock Spire".
---
However, sometimes due to information having to be kept short youd start a PM with "OOC", meaning out of character and youd talk like you would on a normal server. For example if the main tank is explaining the offtank what he did wrong on an attempt on a raid boss (only PMs tho)
---
All in all I liked the RP experience, because people were polite, didnt talk politics in world chat and simply played a fantasy game fully immersed. Its not as hard core as it sounds. However I have heard from other people, who played RP servers throughout vanilla and TBC, that it can get more intense, involving marrying another character ingame for example (2 heterosexual dudes being married in game).
---
Also sometimes there were some eye roll moments, when individual players slowed down the group trying to finish a dungeon, because hed do some overly dramatic RP monolgue mid dungeon.
---
Anyways, long post sorry.
---
EDIT: I forgot to mention that the most "RP" thing about RP servers in my experience, is that when you ran into another player in the middle of nowhere while questing, hed strike up conversation and ask you who you were, then telling you his personal story. It made the world very flavorful.
---
I prefer the first blue weapon as a class that uses weapons. You just demolish everything.
---
Will history repeat itself? Will people who shouldn't even be playing the MMO genre be listened to and catered to again?
---
This is what happened to WoW, and why it's in the state it's in now. 
---
Of course!
---
No this is truly remarkable. An absolute breakthrough in technology for those looking to level up as paladins!
---
Use foot pedals to auto attack and move around to control your paladin, and then this could free up both hands for he (or she, no judgment here *ladies*) for online viewing pleasure.
---
Truly remarkable. We will watch your paladin career with great interest, Lighwalker.
---
Have you ever tried to use a mouse with your opposite hand? It’s actually pretty difficult!
---
Dire Maul. It's such a unique experience running that dungeon without everyone in heirlooms two shotting things, cant wait to see it again.
---
[deleted]
---
Yes, but I also have never had a broken hand, so I gave up after 5 mins...
---
I'd say it's more difficult to play with just a keyboard
---
I heal one handed.   Don't worry about where my other hand is
---
Its also not awful as DPs either, as 25% IAS from berserking with flurry with really boost your WF/sword spec procs.
---
Each source of IAS stacks multiplicitvely (you poe players know how good that is), and assuming you have swords instead of axes, get a pair of edgmasters and you could be competitive with orcs. Honestly troll is never a bad option, but to min-max there is usually a better choice.
---
This is beyond science.
---
The thing that sucks about that is that when I started playing (early BC), the place I met quite a few friends is when I was in the lower level zones, and we needed to help each other out. The sharding thing isn’t a deal breaker for me, but it would be nice if it wasn’t in the game.
---
I'll perhaps do Deadmines, but I prefer grinding to level.
---
I bet it would transform into a very sensible volvo station wagon
---
okay
---
It's actually kind of insane how close WotLK Naxx was to original. They were almost only 2 years apart.
---
So, it hurts?
---
It's not fact until there's evidence to support it. Right now it's rhetoric.
---
Dungeons is what I love most about WoW, so for me it will be all :)
---
The token would work the same in vanilla as it does on live, since the market would make sure it would be worth the same amount of gold relative to the amount of time it takes to get that much. So in vanilla it would be about 200g for $20. I agree it doesn't really make sense for Classic, though it would massively cut down on gold sellers.

Nah it means happy

i main a rogue so i can get some smoking/piss breaks in while people run back to their corpses
---
Reserved items on run really annoys me. It seems every pserver 60 dungeon has every item on reserve. Good luck ever getting ironfoe or hand of justice as a pug.

Love the pair you get from SFK for the deathstalkers quest. I always use them on anything with a mana bar for about 10-20 levels.
---
Shamans are a much harder match up for mages compared to pallys. You can just sheep the duration of freedom
---
I don't usually level as fury but from what I understand you never want to slam back to back, so it would be slam&gt;auto&gt;slam. also I don't think it's actually worth playing slam until you have the talents in it.
---
I normally play sunder spam to proc imp overpower in arms spec until 40 and then respec into MS instead.
---
Oh also it's usually not worth it to execute while levelling as it can overkill and waste rage.
---
&gt;  DKP has always been more popular, however. Any reason why?  
---
DKP is more popular than EPGP because it has been around longer- quite a bit longer than WoW itself.  If the players involved in DKP avoid gaming the system, the problems that EPGP address don't present themselves.  
---
Both systems ultimately encourage players to horde points so that they can win extremely rare items, which is generally unavoidable outside of loot council.  
---
The advantages of EPGP:  
---
Recent deeds are remembered better than past deeds.  Falling behind by paying a lot of GP will eventually be washed away by the sands of time, whereas falling behind by a little DKP can mean that two really good players are passing on upgrades as they try really hard to be first in line for whatever the best trinket or weapon is.  EPGP encourages players to take gear more than DKP.  GP values can be setup to bring correct costs to bear, without either bidding DKP (which brings an extra level of gamesmanship), or assigning arbitrarily large DKP values (needed in a world where the standard guild member is sitting around 1k to 3k and some hero is at 44k).  
---
I found EPGP to be vastly superior to any other participation-credit loot system.  DKP is simply garbage compared to it.  However, for the players that have used DKP plenty (in some cases for decades), it works fine- they know not to be assholes, and everything works fine.  EPGP is built for a guild with lower trust among members.  
---
Honestly, loot council has really caught on in a lot of places in the last half decade.  It really makes me wonder how it will work in vanilla, which was the most loot drama in any iteration of WoW by far.
---
Gotcha. I was thinking when you hear that sound when you know a rogue or druid is nearby and then you would pop Perception.
---
lol

**Epoch of Thought [H]** | NA-PvP | Wed, Thur, Sun 1800—2200 PST | Hardcore 
---
**About**: EoT started on Bloodscalp shortly after vanilla wow’s release &amp; became a top guild on the server. We’ve persisted as a gaming family ever since. Our goal has always been to clear content as a team while providing a second family for our members.  Our leadership is experienced, skilled, and caring.  We've been around since the beginning and we're not quitting until we've farmed naxx enough to gear everyone :).  We look forward to developing a winning team of people you'd not only want to raid with, but would also like to meet in real life if the chance arose.  
---
For classic we will be a top guild &amp; clear Naxxramas. We have a solid core experienced through Naxx. Most of us have raided for years &amp; are ready to devour classic content. We run a DKP-guided loot council (attendance and contributions are measured and accounted for but there is no bidding). focused on awarding gear where it best serves raid progression &amp; best recognizes attendance, &amp; contribution to raid performance.
---
**What we expect**: We expect dedicated, skilled raiders who show up with consumes, proper gear, &amp; knowledge. We are team-focused so great performers are appreciated &amp; recognized, but divas who are unconcerned with the health of the entire raid team or overly self-interested are not tolerated. We are a diverse group of raiders worthy of individual respect &amp; the respect of everyone’s time.  Toxicity and drama stirring have no place in our guild.  
---
In short, be prepared, be knowledgeable, be on time, &amp; don’t be an A-hole.
---
**Why We Will Survive**:  We are experienced, Dedicated, and prepared.  Our leadership team consists of mature, experienced, and professional leaders.  Our raid core consists of experienced, skilled, and most importantly, dedicated raiders.  We are busy doing all the prep work we need to run a highly organized reasonable competitive guild .  We are inclusive, non-toxic, and value team building and a rewarding social environment over pyrrhic victories.  We we're successful in actual vanilla and have only gotten smarter wiser and more organized with age.  
---
Most importantly we desire complete decimation of classic content and will not stop until we get there.  
---
**Raid Schedule**: Wed, Thur, Sun, 6 PM to 10 PM PST (GMT-8) (9pm – 1 AM EST) hard stops. Our guild has always been extremely active &amp; 20-mans, Onyxia, etc. will continue to be ran on non-core days. On most days, if you log in, you will find a good group of people to smash content with.
---
**Looking for**: Great people of all classes are strongly encouraged to apply; **specifically seeking: Shamans &amp; Resto Druids.** Core raid spots are earned through demonstrated competence &amp; dedication. This means that no core spots will be predetermined and certainly not before anyone's hit 60.
---
If you are interested in leadership roles within the guild please send me a whisper &amp; let’s chat.
---
**Apply**: The best way to join is to shoot me a private discord message (Discord: 
---
Lne#2710 | Battlenet: Lne#1326).  You can also hit up either of my assistant GMs on [B]discord:  XvK#7740  &amp; AYD#5916[/B] 
---
The less social can also fill out an application on our Website &lt;http://epochofthought.shivtr.com&gt;  You can also jump on our discord at &lt;https://discord.gg/UqAVjJT&gt; 
---
**Join us!**
---
And as a rogue, just stay stealth and jumper cable the healer.

"/w &lt;healer&gt; don't res that idiot huntard, make him walk"
---
A decay system is pretty much mandatory for EPGP.  
---
In general, in EPGP, not every trinket or weapon needs to cost the exact same.  Sure, maybe the guy in the priority lead starts to pool.  Maybe the second guy watches his priority in case the first guy takes gear.  But everyone else in that loot pool isn't pooling for that, because the thing can drop thrice and they'll never get it- they just focus on other pieces.  
---
What are the mandatory items from those dungeons? Or are there class quests in there?
---
10-yard range on pet dismiss. 
---
Small EP penalties aren't absurd or unheard of, but almost all punitive actions are extraordinarily rare in any guild I've heard of for real.
---
No dungeon is worth running while leveling, it just slows down your XP gain.  That being said, I find dungeons a good break from leveling so I tend to run most of them at least once (Besides Genomer, fuck that place).
---
Just in time for me to be back in classes &gt;.&lt;
---
Human mages are the best looking mages in the game.  Style &gt; racials when it comes to fun.
---
That's a really good point I hadn't thought of. It's the cross realm part that ruins things, sharding the starter zones doesn't matter if all the people you see are actually on your realm. Beyond slightly influencing who you make friends with that is. 
---
Isn't most of the fun of levelling working out what the optimal way to play is each level? It's not rocket surgery. See how long it takes you to kill something and how much damage you take and compare it with the other options you have.
---
Everyone rolled need for these in WC yesterday. No stats of course.
---
I try to do everyone at least once. I probably end up running most 2-3 times, except for Gnomeregan, BFD, and most of SM.
---
I’ve literally had people tell me I must be a noob for doing dungeons, because if I took the game seriously, I would just quest/grind in the most optimal way. To each their own, but I can only experience leveling dungeons *while I’m leveling*, so may as well get some kicks out of them while I can. 
---
I don’t remember celebrating. They just said “grats”
---
I wish people would get rid of this notion that a successful Classic should cause them change Retail philosophy. Retail still is quite successful - and, regardless of Classic's level of success, should remain so. Its grown away from Vanilla for valid business and gameplay reasons.
---
If you want to see changes in Retail then by all means campaign for them, but don't link it to the success of Classic.
---
&gt;How slow is instance leveling?
---
Tested this extensively in Vanilla.  Much slower.
---
&gt;Since warrior is a long hard grind could this be a fun alternative? Spend an extra 24hr doing dungeons rather than slow grinding mobs?
---
To level a warrior fast you need 3 things: A new weapon every 5 to 10 levels(quests, dungeons, AH), lots of healing pots, and generally quest on mobs that are green to you(You'll kill about twice as fast on green mobs and can use cleve pretty often).
---
Do all that and leveling a warrior isn't bad at all.
---
I like that spec. Um to be honest I think if you're going oom, then it's probably a good sign- you're not getting focussed down, your team is getting heals... sounds pretty good to me
---
I liked Ythisens reply on the subject, in the latest Classicast. They asked if he thought there was a chance that *elements* of Classic be integrated or considered when developing new content.
---
He agreed that the two games should absolutely serve the demographics that still pay to play them, but he mentioned Attunements as an example. If the response in 2019 is good, it wouldn’t be a stretch or pitfall to consider a modernized version of the attunement mechanic.
---
Edit: also, Blizzard had been under the notion that we think we do, but we don’t. If there’s any element of Classic that we absolutely *do*, then it would be foolish to not even consider it. But by no means should retail ever become a Frankenstein of Classic and Live because that would be a game neither group would want.
---
it removes bleeds yes, it makes you immune to them for the 8 seconds it lasts so it just drops them all off and none can affect you during stone form, but it also removes diseases and poisons, which is really helpful against rogue blind.
---
&gt;what do you mean by 40v40-120 not possible on blizzard servers? That makes blizzard look really bad if they cant handle it.
---
[Here are 40 paladins vs 40 death knights in AV](https://youtu.be/iz1_DLm3mCk?t=100).  Whatever their current server setup is, it's not great. 
---
Yeah you're right, but i was more thinking about surviving a war with a pocket pal, bg situation, not 1v1 !
---
There is an addon to block those. Dont get a single gold whisper on my main, but whenever i log on my bank alt without the addon i instantly get a whisper lol.
---
Retail is successful monetarily because of the cash shop and various services. BfA content wise has largely been seen as unsuccessful thus far (though that can change with a strong 8.1.5 and 8.2 showing). You said campaign for changing retail if that’s what we want... well that’s exactly what this post is: an attempt to get dev’s to realize how far the game has drifted away from its original form. Go play get an epic item in retail then do it in classic. Try to tell me there’s not a major difference. 
---
Electric Boogaloo
---
i don't think using slam at all would be correct? it gets pushback when damaged and delays your next aa till it finishes, so it is a straight dps loss if taking any hits, as well as making you unable to move during it so you can't hamstring kite the mobs
---
It's the same client, though. All 3 of them are, same update version and everything. There's even a command line that turns the NA client into the CH client, model-wise. It's not like FFXIV where CH and KR clients are behind. 
---
Constructive. I’m sure OP had *no idea* Prot pallies weren’t ideal.
---
Depends how close the next mob is.  But yes, in general, you should only use execute at minimum rage required to use it in PvE.
---
for me it's not even a question of min/max.... gnome vs human, gnomes just have an entire other ability that's extremely useful and fun to use, compared to perception which is pretty useless, especially for a mage who can just aoe spam a rogue out of stealth. escape artist is on a super short cooldown too, so you get to use it all the time.
---
more abilities = more fun = the clear option. i'm not thinking, "must focus on min/maxing, need to empty the poopsock"... i'm focused on having fun in pvp, which involves giving myself the best and most entertaining options available. 
---
the question of horde vs alliance, WoTF is arguably equally useful as escape artist. so horde vs alliance, no, you won't be gimped really if you play alliance. if you play *human* however, ya, you are gimping yourself, and also not having as much fun in my eyes, because you then have just 1 useless ability. 
---
I love doing the undead starting zone. It is one of the most beautiful places I have leveled.
---
I also really enjoy Tauren starting zones and then leading into the barrens. I will admit the barrens are a bit....barren but I still really enjoy leveling in the horde zones. More than likely i will only be playing horde.
---
Orc

Undead

Tauren

not necessarily in that order there may be a troll in there as a priest or mage depending if im feeling it at the time but ill be starting 2 to 4 characters immediately to get my names.
---
I’ve played since I was around 8 or so. Throughout most of my life that I’ve played the game seriously (Excluding Cata to live WoW) I remember having dreams of nonexistent zones or dungeons, that would always encourage my younger self to map out what I saw in the dream. 
---
In the past year I’ve picked up Classic, I still get the occasional dream that feels like an otherworldly Zone that doesn’t look like anything they’ve released before.
---
I don't normally  but I did have a WoW dream last night.
---
I was an SM/Ruin Warlock, but I was IN the game. I recall dotting all the mobs during the pulls. Were doing the trash towards Garr. I then dotted every Garr add, and did
