The horde can win lol. Eventually the allies get cocky enough to leave 30 people AFk then its our time lol.
---
---
---
Awesome 
---
It seriously is so painful to have to check the forums for disappointment every day.... I mean I have the mirror to remind me of that anyway.
---

---
I don’t know why they can’t give a more accurate timeframe of expected release.
---
Whirlwind/overpower
---
Is less than 8% supposed to be a convincing response? I’m all for mixed server types, RP-PVP included. However, it seems like waiting until we see how many people will actually play Classic is the most prudent option.
---
:(, I was actually planning to play on RP-PvP server. Oh well... PvP it is for me then.
---
Getting to 20 in a night is the easy part! 30-60 is the real slog.
---
There are two. one is 29/11/11 that's already linked the other one is 30/0/21. You can put the points however you want as long as you get natures swiftness and moonfury. You need AQ gear for these specs to be good though I would not recommend to play these at start, especially not if you're new. 
---
For pvp no, and it’s not close. Dev plague is disgusting in many matchups and wotf is easily one of the strongest pvp racials in the game. You’re going to get blackout procs every fight so more on the dr doesn’t make much difference and hex is a very weak debuff rarely worth the global.
---
In terms of population they are pretty okay actually. 7% has indicated they intend to play on a RP-PvP realm, if we end up getting one that is. Since there are only very few RP-PvP realms they are pretty stable. 
---
Other than that I would mostly consider it an ordinary PvP realm with an older and more mature (read less toxic) playerbase. Definitely recommend playing on one :)
---
what's with saying you get AV exalted in a couple hours holy shit. 
---
you can get AV exalted fast if: you play on 2x weekend, win a bunch, and rush a lot while queue is constantly popping; and it still takes well over a couple hours. more like it takes the weekend
---
Who even follows streamers? Why? Genuine question.. 
---
The bottle neck. There’s a huge bottle neck that connects Lakeshire with the rest of the zone/quest areas. Easier to mow down the lowbies. 
---
We should all aspire to have a healthy frame M'goodboy. 
---
Level as arms for a marginal DPS loss for a massive PvP boost. Fury won't kill anything in world PvP.
---
its not that hard though if you back cap while they are pushing boss. they likely don't have people just watching the GY cause they need to push.
---
also, what happened to the fact that you have to cap the towers and a group of 3-5 people can fuck up the tower rush and delay starting the boss. that's real AV not a 2 day slog. unless the enemy team has overgeared tank(s) and healers they cant just rush boss and ignore the captains
---
I played on this server too!
---
For horde it doesn't matter really, both are good. If you like troll just go with it, it's really good in group pvp because you gimp all the paladins heals. For solo PvP I would say undead is sliightly better. Just take whatever you like more. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
That’s an absurdly complex system. Just use EPGP with a veto for specific items called out ahead of time.
---
he adds a 2hr minimum queue to each match becuase MUH PVE PREBIS in a pvp zone
---
If I recall correctly warrior abilities take into account the damage from a swing of their weapon. So while two weapons might have the same DPS a slow weapon would have larger numbers per hit. This would make the abilities do more damage. Please correct me if I'm wrong
---
definitely splits it up too much
---
pve server lol
---
Without that tier of gear, you just run out of mana? 
---
I don't normally upvote, and I sure as shit don't comment on posts. But this one made me smile. Thank you, feel free to unzip pants now
---
#SUMMON THE ICE LORD!!!
---
FUCKINF HELL YEAH WE WILL
---
Nobody wants 1.12 AV, we want to start with 1.5 and then progress.
---
If you're interested at all in building a PC, there are a lot of tutorials you could watch to see if it's something you're up for. 
---
 Unless you have zero mechanical abilities and don't know basic software troubleshooting, the biggest hurdle is the decision to do it. 
---
Gear means more in retail guilds as fights are much much harder and tightly tuned. 
---
If people turtle for long enough yea. Reinforcements is what killed those things.
---
Are medicine balls better?
---
No your damage is low. You're better off just going resto or resto hybrid at that stage. It isn't until you reach 250+ spellpower you can actually start nuking people. I mean you COULD play it before that it just won't be that good.
---
I can immediately see how that would be interesting and useful information for some guilds. For us, it’s less about identifying “proper” distribution rather than enabling transparent distribution. 
---
Hell no dude.   I want a pvp match i can kill 5 hours in.
---
The only thing I don't like about this one is the 256gb HD. Will constantly be up against the wall with no space. 
---
Oh absolutely.  Without reinforcements to blow through, a turtle is a turtle for fucking ever.
---
&gt; its not that hard though if you back cap while they are pushing boss. they likely don't have people just watching the GY cause they need to push. 
---
That strat is old and known. Recent games I play in people account for back-capping and actually put up defense on the points. 
---
Rushing the final GY was a point of bypassing the cluster of NPCs and defending players at the first two towers. Once the GY turns you can send people back to the first towers. Otherwise you risk people dying and getting forced to res in your own base. In retail that's even less of an issue because of the removal of even more NPCs and the removal of the Lietenants (lieutenants will be in 1.12), so you can just rush initial towers no problem along the way. 
---
Where does most of your damage come from, just moonfiring and running around with the odd wrath splashed in?
---
Int and Stam, and then more Stam and Int.
---
I would be pretty happy with them delaying it.  That means their priority is on quality.
---
"Guys, go out in front of Stormwind! Two druids have been dueling since sunday!!!"
---
If you're the creator of this, can you edit the Redridge Mountains floating scrawl title thing onto the first panel so that the meme can stand alone without the caption? 
---
And then what you do in hillsbrad, they'll remember in STV.
---
The only "progress" they did to AV was to nerf it.  Literally nothing they did was a gameplay improvement.  It was all just nerfs to shut up the kids crying that they couldn't grind rep fast enough.
---
To the OP, even with reinforcements you can get the big guys summoned.  You just need people to actually want to.
---
yeah basically, you want to kite them. Keep max range with insect swarm and moonfire up, wrath or starfire if you can get a root off. So dots on them and rejuv on urself until they die. Hunters are an exception, you want to stand in their deadzone but spells are the same.

I'm amazed at the high % for pvp servers with all the belly aching about griefing, camping etc. Didn't retail change how world pvp is now done? 
---
Youre getting downvoted because lol boomkin
---
Yeah with that amount of space you basically have to get an external drive
---
More like mid vanilla, 10 months after na release, 7 months after eu release.
---
Westfall is very difficult at level 10 for a lot of classes.
---
The quests and mobs are easier in Loch Modan at level 10 as well. I'm pretty sure the vanilla guide people use also tells you to go to Loch Modan after Elwynn too. 
---
I absolutely did this on accident first time I played and I liked that accidental routing so much. I'm such a nostalgia junkie I'll probably make another nelf warrior and do it again.
---
WoD launched with 10 mill+ in the first quarter. Blizz were still releasing sub numbers back then.
---
Also, how old is this post? I stopped playing WoW months ago.
---
As someone who started their long-lasting RP hobby on a RP-PVP Server (Ravenholdt Europe) I hope you guys get what you want. I am curious how the RP community will unfold in Classic, though. Previously in WoW's lifestyle RP was split across multiple servers, although eventually everyone sort of got absorbed into the biggest RP server, EU Argent Dawn and RP-PVP servers just became...PVP servers.
---
I'm wondering ifthere'll actually be RP to be had in Classic RP-PVP servers, or if RP will just be confined to whichever realm has the largest roleplay community.
---
As much as I want it to come out asap, it's winter here in Australia and I love snowboarding. A late September release would mean I can play more and still snowboard a bunch this year. By winter next year I will be burnt out or just "can take a break for a weekend" so it won't be as much of an issue.
---
Losing whole weekends of leveling would put me way behind the curve and I like keeping up with at least the decent speed levelers. (I'm not no-lifeing)
---
I didn't realize the diff between 1050 and 1050ti was that much. Hmm this would be a tough call for me haha. 
---
You dont take boomkin form?
---
TROLL: Shadowguard procs blackout (3 charges then refresh) Berserking(not good at all since it doesnt work on channeling, costs mana aswell) Hex of Weakness 20% less healing, noth that great, regeneration(garbage).
---
UNDEAD: Remove fear,charm,sleep and be immune to it for 5 seconds, touch of weakness procs blackout, devouring plague is insane vs people who cant remove it, cannibalize, shadow resistance.
---
I mean, how can any non brain damaged person think Troll is better...
---
[removed]
---
1050 or 1050ti with a modern cpu will smash classic no problem, so don't restrict yourself to just "gaming" laptops. There are other machines with the above specs that are built for creative professionals/students that may work better for you, ie real battery life, good display, no shit trackpad, and a good keyboard. 
---
You just kind of have to suck it up and play Frost through those two. once you make it past them, you gear enough that you can play them as fire later on.
---
Many people got banned (I personally got a warning) for using the old Fire Nova Totem &amp; logout trick to kill players of your own faction. I only used it to kill those groups of spammers that hacked and used corpses to advertise in cities though tbf.
---
So banning for casting spells isn't too far off the table. 
---
Doesn't matter. Blizzard's logic is that RP-PvP is a smaller niche than RP-PvE, and therefore will only do RP-PvE. That means they acknowledge that there is sufficient demand for RP servers, but they believe that PvE is more popular. That poll has a fairly large sample size to support otherwise.
---
There's no need to even start guessing as to how many people that poll translates to in the real world, as Blizzard already concluded that "it's enough". The only question worth asking is whether there's a significant sample bias, but in that regard an 18k sample size is actually very large for online polls.
---
Lol, you made me laugh. 
---
Thanks for the insights, I'll let you know how it goes in X number of months
---
I do
---
The only race i refuse to roll female.
---
I agree I shouldn't of used the word progress. Perhaps regress. 
---
bloodthirst and whirlwind has chance to proc hoj
---
That is an exceptionally reasonable amount of time to get notice for a lengthy leave period.
---
I think its a good deal considering external drives are pretty cheap these days. A better GPU is definitely worth having over Hard drive space, because its harder/impossible to upgrade the GPU. And you can get a 1tb External for less than $50.
---
I really hope they add them, throwing my voice in for them as well.  I won't have my main character on it, but I will have an alt for sure when I want to RP, and also have the fun of WPVP
---
We did that as well. Though minus Frost Shock as EB was enough (and I think hunters used their frost trap as well). It was a huge pain in the d\*ck. I think if our DPS were better, then we could've just killed all the adds as well. At least that's what they're doing on pservers. But no idea if pservers are accurate enough for it to have also been possible in Vanilla.
---
Bloodthirst is soley based on Attack Power, and whirlwind seems rarely used.  
---
I'm just struggling to wrap my head around it, because as fury you don't seem to have wep coefficients into your attacks
---
sad day indeed
---
What niche does RP PVP fill? I'm kinda ignorant to the different server types, is it just people that are interested in RP but also PVP? How is it different from RP PVE if there's a pvp flag and stuff? 
---
I said proc, not scaling
---
At least they could make a public survey to assess the amount of RP-PVP players.
---
My very first character was a prot tank complete with shield.  Whoops.  It was so slow I started over.
---
My second character was a rogue.  Night and day!
---
True. Getting 40 people to show up was back in the day the biggest headache for the far majority of guilds.
---
&gt;World of Warcraft Client Patch 1.12 - Drums of War
---
Cross-Realm Battlegrounds
---
For the first time in the history of World of Warcraft, you will be able to face off against players from other realms in the Battlegrounds. PvP Battlegrounds link Alterac Valley, Warsong Gulch, and Arathi Basin so that players from several realms will be combined into one huge matchmaking pool. Replenish your mana, sharpen your blades, and get ready for some brand-new challengers!
---
That's my recollection.
---
Maybe not the best, but with a lock you can send your pet Voidwalker into a neutral town from far away and mess with people. If you attack a hunter pet on defensive or a mage with frost shield it will flag them and guards will kill them. If anything such as druid thorns or shaman orbs damages the VW, they get flagged. The guards will eventually aggro you but you just run away, rinse and repeat.
---
@1:05 "50 DKP MINUS!"  lol
---
We considered EPGP.
---
We rejected it because we didn’t feel it fit what we’re looking for. It felt like “fairness through more math.”
---
We’re optimizing for transparency, freedom, and equality of reward in a social context. 
---
Oh god that was absolutely awful to watch. OTOH it also makes me want to play a priest for some reason.
---
I hope people, especially those who've not played private servers or live in a few years, realise the game will be nothing like that any more. Nobody is going to actually click and play like that, the game will be far faster. You won't be able to walk around players because they're keyboard turning and clicking. Even the "gods" of pvp back then are awful compared to the average pvp player these days that'll end up playing just because things like keybinds are a normal thing. 
---
As I mentioned there, Druid’s who legit try to one v one you are idiots and are only deserving of /spit.
---
That being said, Druid’s will gank each other while grinding because Druid’s have fragile ego’s due to not really being able to kill people. I look forward to some cat Druid ripping me a new backside while I’m leveling in STV.
---
No, they did not in vanilla, although they do in the current game 
---
Perhaps. Our starting bids will be quite low. 
---
We recognized we might be overbuilding, but we felt better overbuilding, publishing early, and then adjusting down as necessary rather than under building and then trying to extend new controls over a process we said would be super lax. 
---
I think the best thing to do is to do HIIT workouts while you are on each flight path. 
---
Idk why this same post gets on front page every day. I want classic as much as anyone else, but my God does this sub sound like crybabies sometimes. And yes I too have PTO to use and plan around, but I dont complain everyday about it.
---
Tell your friend to roll shadow priest for a kick ass combo
---
I disagree and world chat is not an IC chat so who cares what's said in world chat. If you think there wont be dancing e sexing elves on  normal rp servers guess again.
---
I will only play rp on rp-pvp because without the contested zones it ruins the immersion for me.
---
 You think I'm just goona let some undead scum pass by me in the plaguelands without drawing my blade!!??
---
It's not so much that I think it'll actually only be ~30k, I just think it's unrealistic this early to anticipate it beating retail. Other successful MMOs possibly, but retail is this weird anomalous behemoth.
---
I am optimistic that classic will exceed many people's expectations though.
---
I’m sending my kid to college on all the chiropractic services I rendered from Trolls. Those hunchbacks fill lunch packs if you catch my drift.
---
If there's a lot of focus on RP (i.e. it's easy to find other roleplayers just out and about in major cities or even in the world, and not relying on special chats or forums) then I agree, RP-PvP would be a more immersive experience.
---
You know, this may come as a surprise, but you can do those starting zones on any Alliance or Horde respectively.  
---
I'm choosing gnome because of the obvious physical superiority.  
---
The great thing is that lakeshire is really close to stormwind. So getting some 60s to rescue the town isn't too hard. It's just when they kill the quest givers that it becomes a little annoying.
---
We want players to assign their own values. We don’t want to dictate or compute value. 
---
For us, raiding is social first, performance second. Now obviously, progress is important to a good social experience. But we’re not here to min-max the meters. 
---
Tier is special not just because it’s got stats; it’s special because it’s the unique badge of accomplishment for each class, and not everybody has been raiding the private server scene. 
---
We want everybody to be able to get tier over time without having to worry about its impact on their available DKP for other items. If it’s not important to them and they know it is to someone else? Just pass. 
---
&gt; They are simply time hating content. They aren’t changing how that content was in 1.12.
---
yes they are. they are reverting the gear that was buffed/changed in later patches until that tier content is released
---
*Along the way, we’ve taken a close look at items that provide the biggest power gains, many of which were introduced in 1.10 as part of a sweeping dungeon itemization pass. That patch was when Tier 0.5 gear was introduced, and Relics were added to the drop tables of many bosses. It also adjusted drop rates and drop locations of a lot of gear (to make room for the Relics). We’ve gone back and reconstructed many of the most heavily affected drop tables as they existed prior to the 1.10 patch, and we’re planning to update the drop tables alongside the Ahn’Qiraj War Effort. Prior to the Ahn’Qiraj unlock, most of the drop rates and locations will look as they did in the patches prior to 1.10, with exceptions—there are lots of little changes made in earlier patches that don’t have a big effect on player power, and in those cases, we’re planning to use the 1.12 drop rates and locations.
---
*Phase 5
---
Ahn’Qiraj War Effort begins
---
Ahn’Qiraj raids open when the war effort dictates
---
Dungeon loot reconfiguration: Tier 0.5 Dungeon gear, Relics, drop rates and location changes
---
I know everyone is freaking out at the moment, but in my personal experience, it was entirely indistinguishable from a regular PvP server. From '05-'10 played on Twisting Nether (RP-PvP) as Alliance and on Illidan as Horde and besides for the noticeable population difference, they were basically the same. 
---
People still made fun of RPers on Twisting Nether (ironic, I know) and people RPed in random places on Illidan. 
---
The only noticeable difference I saw, if I remember correctly, was that RP servers had stricter naming standards. So names like xlegolazz or beefcrits werent allowed-- which, I'll be honest was interesting. 
---
I played on an RP-PVP server over vanilla and tbc, and tbh it really just felt like a pvp server. I very very rarely saw rp happening. I agree in theory that it’s the best of both worlds, but IMO in practice there’s no point because anyone who wants to RP goes to an RP (pve) realm. 
---
If Classic got 50,000 long-term subscribers, it would be pretty much a resounding success.
---
For Blizzard and for us, Classic is going to win.
---
Dwarf is the correct answer.
---
Dreamwalker is the best set in the game.
---
&gt; As a sometimes-RPer with a different perspective, I suppose to you: isn't part of the fun of roleplaying out in the world going to be the inherent possibility of some havoc interrupting?
---
It seems like if that is what *you* want, you can just flag up. Hey presto, there is now the inherent possibility of some havoc interrupting.
---
I don't think I've ever played through the whole NE starting zone, so I might do that. I think I've played through the UD starting zone but I don't really remember it at all. Actually I haven't done Dun Morogh fully either I don't think. Just Elwynn, Mulgore a few times (love Mulgore :) ) and Durotar. 
---
Hold up you went from Elwynn right into Redridge? What goretusk pies you been eating? #beefcake
---
I was thinking south parks Mickey Mouse after I clicked the video. 
---
You can kill a paladin in vanilla.. they either bubble hearth or kill themselves. 
---
Think you got that backwards, you horde dog. 
---
I expect a date some time in May if I were to guess. So hang in there.
---
Gnome. 
---
No, it's way too debilitating for pvp- can't entangle, heal, and you miss out on either nature's swiftness, or in my case, insect swarm / feral charge - can't have both
---
In wow you had your character.  It was you.   You toyed in alts, but you mainly played your main.
---
By not having duel spec, you increased your uniquenness by 3 times (with dual spec a holy priest could also be a shadow priest or a disc.).  In vanilla you were a shadow priest.   It was you.  There was nothing holy about you, and there never would be.
---
As if you wouldn’t want to be a dwarven warrior who’s ultimate purpose is to reclaim the lost warhammer Ironfoe, an epic weapon heralded as the bane of Orcs.
---
Errr Nope something competely different. 
---
Short answer. Because it do more damage.
---
That's also the long answer.
---
Thats true.  Probably why i hated it.
---
Haha! This is amazing! How humbling. Azeroth's most powerful and dedicated heroes... obliterated in one shot by an old God...
---
Huh, I hadn’t heard that RP-PvP wasn’t going to be a thing. I was agonizing trying to decide if an RP PvP server was the choice to make, but I guess that won’t require any more thought. 
---
Shit, what's the point, then?! IMO Paladin buffs should have been more powerful but last only like a couple minutes. 
---
It’s not an uncommon opinion that getting natures swiftness is better than getting charge. Once melee dps starts getting bis raid gear bear form stops being a good strategy, you’re pretty much dead if they get in range so that strat is just to keep away and kite.
---
People don't underestimate shadow priests. I'd argue they are the best pvp class, especially with gear. They wreck house, via melting faces.
---
Doesn’t matter anymore. No RPPvP. GG Activision. 
---
I still don't get streaming - watching someone else play a video game has always felt like torture.
---
It was ready around 14 years ago. 
---
Made me laugh haha, too true. Do you have a source for this meme that I could use please?
---
has blizzard come out and said there won't be rp-pvp servers? i'm confused as to whether we're worrying based on guessing or worrying based on an actual statement. side note: i really do hope they add rp-pvp realms
---
The point of frost shock was to grab aggro and slow them simultaneously.
---
It was probably possible to just kill them in vanilla just like it is done on pservers, but I don't think you can really manage it with the stats you get from T1 gear.  When we were doing that fight, it was back when everyone thought T1 was actually good, long before the re-itemization patches that made the current pre-bis a thing.  Once your raid has mostly T2 stuff killing them is likely possible.
---
Because alliance characters are butt fucking ugly and so are you probably. 
---
You're in a Ventrilo server (that someone is paying real money for) in 2019.
---
You deserve whatever fate befalls you.
---
[https://www.divergencewow.com](https://www.divergencewow.com)  
---
We may roll on a RPPvP server just because it's low pop.
---
It's standing or sitting for extended hours - anything that keeps your posture relatively immobile. Standing burns more calories, but is harder on joints. Sitting is bad for your back/neck.  
---
Based on OSHA work center health information pamphlets, alternating between the two is the optimum way to maximize time on a workstation with minimal damage to the human body.  
---
Another issue is constantly focusing at the same depth. So they also recommend focusing on things around the room, and outside, if possible. Taking a walk or stretching at least every 45 minutes is also encouraged, if practical. And finally, adjusting the position of your mouse/keyboard routinely helps to improve bloodflow and reduce the liklihood of carpal tunnel, etc.  
---
Last thing, is noise. Many sounds produced constantly at certain decibel levels will eventually cause hearing loss. Even sounds as low as 10-12 dB can cause hearing loss if experienced for several hours. So, adjust your volume too - nothing too static. Give your VOIP a break, play some quiet music, or just turn it all down for awhile. Most importantly, make sure your computer doesn't run too loud - or maybe even consider moving your computer into another room to avoid being right next to those furiously running fans!
---
Well if you aren't following a guide and doing all the quests, you'll usually be level 12 by the time you go to Westfall.
---
I know we have some Blizzard folks that peruse the sub so I'll throw in my opinion. I'm one of those dudes that would roll rp-pvp if given the chance. I'm not gonna pretend its gonna ruin the game for me if there isn't one. But even just one rp-pvp server is a must have I would think. There are a lot of folks that like to roll on RP servers strictly because the community tends to be better. Not even to RP. Limiting those folks to a PvE server can suck too.
---
I don't have a solution, but maps like the one you are trying to create would be pretty helpful for routing out optimal exploration xp leveling. Especially if combined with a mob spawn map which I've seen various addons create so the user knows where it is safe to travel.
---
Thank you both for your comments, and I apologize if I started a heated topic.
---
*So, to summarize your suggestion*: at 40 respec into prot and go all the way to holy shield (or holy first potentially). Then, spec into holy to go for consecration (probably get that strength and int increase to 5/5). Make sure to get shield spike and use ret aura.
---
*Then my last questions for you would be:* 1. Would you run blessing of wisdom or blessing of sanctuary, and 2. Would you pick up any points in reckoning at all in the prot tree? (since the /sit doesn't work and this method was best with a 2H weapon... I'll be using a sword and shield so I don't see reckoning doing that much dmg)
---
Mm... that's why I'm putting my paladin on RP-PVE. 
---
As far as I know Shadowmeld gives +5 and maxed MoD gives +15, total of 4 character levels of stealth.
---
Perception gives +50 detection, +10 levels worth
---
Humans still have a pretty big edge with perception unless the Rogue pops vanish, then they're impossible to detect.
---
lightning bolt! lightning bolt!
---
LUL RPers
---
Still deciding between Priest and Druid. Will be doing mostly 5/10mans and BGs, and maybe some PUG 20mans + Ony/MC.
---
I like the idea of one spec to tank and heal, as well as all around for PVP (HotW); tanking especially interests me (as a former TBC Tankadin). So Druid is tempting. I am afraid there are going to be a glut of bear tanks/kitties/druids in general with something to prove. If they are indeed rare then that makes it extra alluring.
---
I'm not much of a DPSer, but I do like the idea of melting faces as Shadow in PVP. But I would like to be able to heal 5 mans and the occasional raid, so maybe I go PI spec (can farm lashers this way as well), or I bite the 50g bullet and respec as needed. 
---
Open to any suggestions. Am I going to have to flip a coin?
---
Entangling roots and watch them panic as the Moba close in
---
From my memories as a balance druid back in the day, it was okayish, but I wouldn't reccomend it.
---
If I recall correctly my talents were something like this:  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0tsx0MEstZxVco](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0tsx0MEstZxVco)   
---
One thing I remember for sure is, I think you really want Improved Starfire. The 3 second stun can be an absolute game changer. Also, I don't like that other guy's build that doesn't include Moonkin. The whole point is being moonkin. 
---
lmao, what a post
---
Eyes of the best was made for this shit 
---
It has a goth feel to it. I like it. I like it very much. Thanks for sharing. As I'm moving in 3 months and need new wall decorations, really using his art for it. Would coincide nicely with WoW Classic's release.
---
Reach your final form.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NLCaolW-I0
---
Thanks so much for the long response. In your opinion, at \~lvl 40, would you recommend going straight for holy shield at first, or only going for blessing of sanctuary then going for consecration right after that (lvl 41)? 
---
I also asked another user this, but would you recommend putting 5/5 in reckoning still? Or would you just skip it and get more defense? 
---
I'm 100% down to donate some time.
---
Cause even your example is innacurate:
---
&gt;Here's a quick idea/example what I'm looking to get with borders of subzone/area: https://ibb.co/rvPty9H
---
Gnomer, #1 zone on the map, extends to the right along the N road, to about the L in Brewnal Village at the road above, and down to the B on the same road.
---
Is this for exploration XP? cause not everything circled on the same map is an exploration point. Coldridge Valley has 3 subzones on the same map, but only exists as 1 xp granting exploration point.
---
Either way, this kind of thing is down my alley for a variety of reasons. I'm 100% down to accurately map out the boundaries for a zone. More zones if I get bored.
---
Tarren mill*. Common mistake though. I called it tauren mill for a long time. I play alliance though so I wasn’t there much.
---
&gt;I'm thinking dwarf. I love dun morogh frankly,
---
I'm going human paladin cause racial wins for leveling and rep, dwarves give nothing I can't do without.
---
Dun Morogh's fine, I'll spend 40 minutes there, even as a human, but 40 minutes out of 7,000 hours rounds to 0, so meh. Though all my human toons live in IF cause it's best.
---
So I would really look more into people that have recent data / specs into this, but you're going to want to go either 11/21/0 at 41, or 0/31/0 at 40, I know consecration will do more damage overall versus 3+ mobs, but holyshield will negate much more damage and do about the same damage versus 3 mobs. If you have another AoE damage dealer, holy shield is best, if you have a healer or another tank / paladin, consecration is best. I remember AoEing raptors in STV back in the day, so that would have been only with consecration. Again, you'll need to be investing in gear- aiming for plate at 40 and keeping up with new shields. On the plus side, you get a lv 40 mount for free, so $$
---
i know but wouldn't you have to run all the way?
---
Undead
---
Takes like 20 minutes. No big deal.  
---
It deals periodic fire damage to any surrounding players. If you banish it on the AH it usually results in a pile of dead level 1 bank alts.
---
Edited. Thanks. 
---
Instant off-global-cooldown abilities hit harder with slower weapons since their damage is based on your weapon damage. This is the same reason rogues prefer slow mainhand weapons.
---
Excuse us for not bathing in gay perfumed water with sissy flowers. Also your women only are married to your men for the money and feudal privileges, but sneak out of bed in the night to go to Orgrimmar to get what they need.
---
You got the correct answer already but here are numbers to illustrate the principal. 
---
1.5 speed 15 damage per hit weapon. Does 300 damage over 30 seconds. 20 attacks. 
---
3.0 speed 30 damage per hit weapon. Does 300 damage over 30 seconds. 10 attacks. 
---
So far so good, right? 
---
Now we are going to add a fake HoJ. Ours is 100% chance on hit to add an extra attack. 
---
Our fast 1her gets 20 extra attacks, adding 300 damage. Our slower 1her gets 10 extra attack, adding 300 damage. Still seems like it doesn't matter, right?
---
Now we are going to add in an ability. This ability reads "Instantly attack." It has a 15 second cooldown and does absolutely nothing else. 
---
1.5 Speed weapon gets 20 attacks+20 attacks from our OPHoJ+2 Attacks from our ability. This ability adds 2 additional OPHoJ proc for a total of 44 attacks at 15 damage. 660 damage.
---
3.0 Speed weapon gets 10 attacks+10 attacks from OPHoJ Attacks+2 attacks from our ability. This ability adds 2 additional OPHoJ attack for a total of 24 attacks at 30 damage. 720 damage. 
---
See what happened? We went from 40 to 44 attacks on the fast weapon, an increase of 10%, but we went from 20 to 24 attacks on the slow weapon, an increase of 20%. In each case we got +4 attacks, but the +4 attacks for the fast weapon hit for 60 whereas the +4 attacks for the slow weapon hit for 120. 
---
As long as abilities exist that count as an instant auto, slower will always be better (this is a lie actually, with sufficient tweaking you could make it not matter and actually have some cool things going on, but I digress). I'm ignoring some other factors, like the way resetting the swing timer interacts with GCD and latency also favoring slower weapons or hidden ICDs on certain items and a host of other things, even enchants having PPM favors slower weapons. 
---
I'll probably be on PvE or RP servers. Never like being ganked. But I hope everyone can be in the server they want. 
---
I mean, yes, this is accurate. Why else would someone get downvoted for asking an honest, respectful question?
---
My brother is wanting to play rogue. What is a good class that will compliment rogue? I am leaning mage... thoughts?
---
I gotchoo bb.
---
LOK'TAR OGAR!
---
Oh god. Not that guy again. I only lasted a week on no food. I still haven't figured out how the guy latest that long as he did. And the smug "anyone can do it"-like face in the post pic isn't helping either.
---
your view of druid pvp is warped, go watch stormx. sitting in bear letting urself get gouged and blinded and reopened on is dumb, u wont out dps the rogue, u won't out last him
---
Shadowguard is amazing for shadow priests. It can't be spammed, but if someone is attacking the priest it can be used about as often as mind blast and is a huge DPS increase over mind flay:
---
With +500 spell damage and before taking any shadow damage talents/buffs into account:
---
Mind Flay: 217 DPS
---
Shadowguard: 565 DPS
---
The more spell damage the priest has the wider the gap becomes, because shadowguard is an instant cast spell with a 100% spell coefficient while mind flay is a 3 second cast spell with a 45% spell coefficient, so shadowguard DPS scales 4.44 times better with spell damage.
---
The convincing response is, if they think there's enough demand for an RP server, then there certainly is plenty for an RP-PVP server.
---
I'm honestly shocked attention how large a pie slice pvp is.  Wouldn't have guessed it but then again with 280 days /played I probably only have a few hours invested in bg pvp or pvp mode....
---
Yeah this is why I'm leveling my warrior in a duo, and I'll do an easier class for solo play lol
---
This was a great read. I'm saving this post.
---
Congrats! I bet walking is much more comfortable now. It was for me when I lost that much.
---
Honestly this is fucking retail right now too.
---
Got to remember purple &gt; blue still at this point in wow 😂 we might be learning how to play our classes now, but we all still wanted purple for flex 
---
I played a lot of AV in the pre-tbc patch before the storm at 60. We would summon the alliance giant pretty frequently and I remember fighting the blood lord occasionally too. At 70, I never saw them. We went out of our way to summon ram riders, but that was about it.
---
That’s why retail is so terrible nowadays. All the good devs moved on. 
---
The only thing removed iirc is the ability to loot enemy race specific body parts to cash in for rep / money.
---
You'll still be able to loot armor scraps, blood, and flesh for specific boss / unit quests.
---
no one invites dps warriors to 5-man groups
---
If you’re going for a sub 5 day 60, sure. If you’re going to take 10 days either way, this argument doesn’t hold. There are ways you can grind faster. For instance, Warrior life hack #1: if you’re running through a leveling zone, unlike other classes you can kill stuff running full speed. 
---
Best is to just go ret until level 40ish, then respec once you get a few pieces of plate gear, a good shield + shield spike, and get consecration + blessing of sanc.  
---
I think this AOE build is best done if you have a bit of extra $ to throw towards it.  Farm SM a bunch, get the elite mail gear + shield, and put a spike on it.  At that point you're probably buff enough to actually survive the packs- like if you're just sitting with iffy greens and a bad shield with no spike this will be a painful way to grind.  You'll need to be pretty buff!
---
So yeah.  Respec at 41 to get BoS and Consecrate, then keep going down the prot tree for holy shield.  I would get the reck talents- because it's a great PVP defense or single-target threat booster.  If you are specced this way you'll have NO PROBLEM tanking dungeons- consecrate, judge seal of wisdom at beginning of fight, and then judge righteousness on the focus target and you should be pretty good.  If you have a well geared healer, you can even just keep seal of wisdom up to keep spamming consecrate over and over again (and judge righteousness once in awhile as a quasi-taunt).  
---
For this specific build, you want the +armor talent instead of +defense.  It is actually fine to get crit once in awhile to proc redoubt, and since you're mostly fighting green/yellow mobs a bit of extra defense can push crits either off the table or low enough where you rarely get the beneficial procs.  Armor will benefit you all the time and if you focus on doing instances and getting more plate armor you will be ridiculously tanky. 
---
This is a really niche way to level but definitely can be fun.  It is definitely more challenging than just going full Ret and then into holy/prot for the supplementary talents.  So I'd say it's certainly adding a bit of difficulty to your Holy Journey™ but also makes it a lot more interesting since we all know how interesting leveling a Ret paladin is. 
---
Kazzak is definitely going to be leashed
---
Thanks! I'll look more into it. I don't see myself having the best of the best gear at all times, so I'll probably be only pulling a max of 3 mobs. But we'll see.
---
I don't know if it changed or not but I also fondly remember locking down level 60s on my 30-odd Rogue alt in STV so everyone else could escape. Fun times. 
---
Oh and also, sanctuary is going to go way further for you, but if / when you need to fight 1 mob at a time, wisdom or might can be used
---
As long as you can get near full plate at 40 and keep your shield within 5 levels of you, you're good
---
Mcconnell brings it all together.
---
There was 100% RP-PVP servers during vanilla. 
---
As a Druid IRL lmao wut
---
As a vanilla pally, I agree. Lawbringer and Redemption are meh,  aesthetically.
---
Biggest mistake: leveling past 60 with no mechanic in place to preserve old raids. They could have done it in two ways:
---
1. No more leveling after 60. Just keep releasing content and give you better gear. However, this likely would only go so far before itemization alone makes old content laughable. 
---
2. Zone/instance/raid scaling. I'm my opinion, this is what blizzard should have done. Once you get to 60, most zones are scaled to match to keep the challenge going. With expansions, once you get to new level cap, again, most zones/instances/raids are scaled up to match. And yes, this means that loot scales as well (not any gear you own) but gear dropped by scaled up bosses. 
---
It's the leveling past 60 that caused so many issues with the game. This is in hindsight of course and I don't think the tech was around back then to allow dynamic scaling. Bus
---
But it's what I hope the future of classic wow is..
---
I never had a problem getting exalted with stormpike, you start running it early for the quests(good xp to level with), then run a little here and there as you level in the 50's, you got good rep with the drop turn ins and helping kill minibosses/etc. by the time you're 60 it just happens
---
no, you won't grind out AV to get rank 14, but that's not what it's there for. and making AV any easier to get honor will weaken the achievement of honor ranks('it was harder in real vanilla')
---
T3 shaman best plate set
---
Real men do Elwynn -&gt;  durotar and grind the horde's quest mobs!
---
Earth Shock is an incredibly high threat ability that does good damage on a very low cooldown.
---
Besides they're running the entire thing on 1.12. That's as late into classic launch as you can get. 
---
So how does this build work, is it effective? Someone once said if the windfury procs its a ton of damage but if not you are just standing there doing not much, is that true?
---
Hunters can pvp quite well in pve spec.
---
raids have 1 sm-ruin warlock which is a good pvp spec. Same for deep frost mages.
---
holy paladin there's a pvp+pve spec that's good.
---
I believe priest too.
---
Flagcarry druids can spec pvp without sacrificing too much pve. 
---
The Orc, because the Human has to play with the Alliance.
---
Can anyone explain what the rp-pvp server is? what exactly does it do?
---
You should level both and see for yourself.
---
This is amazing
---
If I didn't have a standing desk I wouldn't be able to make it. 
---
It’s rogue vs rogue. Whoever gets the opener wins. Race doesn’t matter. I’d probably bet human cuz of perception. 
---
Fullt agree. Played RP-PVP since BC. Not only for the above reasons, but also because it’s always been the home of the most mature, adult community. I. e. folks who like classic. -.-
---
Strange way to spell Rogue Bonescythe and Warrior Might sets
---
I think the main point everyone is missing here..... You can't move in shadow meld, so unless you plan on just standing still and waiting for them to come to you, it isn't much use to rogues.
---
Hunters yes, shadow meld, aim shot blah blah blah
---
Humans always get the opener with classic Perception ability.  
---
Orcs eat stuns, so your opener, or kidney shot will be wasted --- 50 percent chance one of them is ignored.
---
I rolled fresh on Maelstrom when they first came out with them in sept 05 too.  My experience was very similar, I played on a pvp server before that.  You may on a very rare occasion run into someone and have some good rp doing a quest or trading.  But most of the RP I remember was because of the large guild I was in would have RP events that were as popular as raiding.  Outside guild events it was just like any pvp server really.
---
This has nothing to do with classic ?
---
It was a BFA Q&amp;A, there was 2 questions related to classic, one about if blizzard had learned something from making classic, and one about RP PVP servers.
---
How is classic going to be dead before its born? Classic is classic they are not making signficant changes so they are not really in control of "ruining classic" if they aren't changing much.
---
Mage is probably a bit more fun in pvp, but warlock has the advantage in pve imo.  
---
Are you RPing playing on a RP server...?...... 
---
....
---
*heavy sweating* 
---
Yes, they are strong.  
---
But be ready to have the worst leveling experience out of all up till at least 40.
---
Depends on if you stand with locked knees or not. If you combine it with a treadmill, or at least stand but with bent knees so that your quads and hamstring get exercised, then a standing desk is beneficial if your goal is to burn more calories when gaming.
---
For me standing desks are great for just cognitive reasons. Standing up and being able to move around a bit activates different parts of your brain, in that it can help expand your mind to more quickly solve a complex problem.
---
I think I'd disagree regarding frost mages. PVP frost doesn't pick up the hit talents, the threat reduction/mana cost reducer, or winter's chill.
---
I'll take a look at your other suggestions, thanks! 
---
If they're too dumb to blink out of it they deserve to get wrecked. 
---
Not at all. Rogue duel depends on opener, stuns and blinds landing. Dwarf is definitely stronger than human, even if they eat every opener. I feel like orc would get more wins than human over matches but I don’t know, interesting question.
---
Iwas in Ironforge Mercs on Burning Legion. I remember you guys being the best alliance guild.
---
Having a sure spot in a dungeon group everytime you advertise for it? Yeah it's a terrible leveling experience. 
---
Do you have a pocket healer with you 24/7? If so, they're lost of fun!
---
Otherwise I hope you enjoy corpse runs
---
That's only cause it's their first time there and they got shiny new weapons, once they start wiping on it repeatedly I bet you they won't be laughing much :p
---
Prediction: Blizz will allow players to "roll back" tunes..... in the caverns of time. Which I think would be hilarious. Allow the retail players to "experience" classic wow, without getting anything that made classic wow classic. 
---
You should stream with your shirt off. 
---
You don't need the threat/mana reducer as deepfrost, but obviously you lose points putting hit and winter's chill, it's not a perfect pvp build of course not, neither are any of the other specs
---
Ahhh, the fabled moonkin druid, such magnificent creature .
---
The stun resist is not 50% lol 
---
&gt;Are there any class/spec combinations that serve as a versatile PVP and PVE spec?
---
A few... depends on what you enjoy. I could say Holy Paladin... but if you don't like being a holy paladin, that recommendation is garbage, even if it's true.
---
I think druid is going to be the least played class and you won't find that many ferals.  In PVP they'll be played mostly as a hybrid, rarely as pure feral.  Feral tanks have great threat, but I doubt many raid pugs will be willing to take the risk over a tried and true warrior tank. 5 mans you'll have no problems getting in. If you do decide to raid, you'll find yourself showered with gear for all specs most likely as most guilds probably won't take more than 2 druids.  
---
You could probably heal most 5 mans as shadow.  For raids you could go PI or holy, both are viable.  Holy will put out more hps, but that doesn't mean you can't keep up as PI while also providing the damage increase to a caster.
---
As a rogue who would duel outside of org a ton, it was common courtesy for rogues to open without stealth. Of course orcs and humans can’t have such a conventional duel so whoever sneaks up on the other will probably win
---
It's 25. 25x2. Please tell me you aren't serious.
---
Idk if this is right or wrong because I’m not that smart but god damn I believe you. Explained very very well. Haha
---
And you could go to Tiragarde Keep and roleplay as a guard.
---
Yes, because the entire way to 60 consists of grouping of for dungeons...
---
I've enjoyed PVP healing before, and the hyper mana-efficient nature of Hpal always appealed to me. I'll take a peek.
---
In a DUEL scenario the human wins because he gets opener even with potential resists it's still better.
---
But that doesn't solve the debate of 
---
&gt;which race makes the superior rogue in PvP..
---
not one bit. If you are in the open world, one will open at random. The orc has a way better chance of winning if he opens than the human does. 
---
nightmare stuff right there
---
I thought you weren't supposed to join the world channel on an RP server? isn't that against the rules of the RP community or something ?
---
It's a nightmare after all
---
That was my guilds strat. Me and the few other hunters kited the drakes around the room in a big circle 
---
If we're only talking about rogue vs rogue duels with 2 people with the same gear, skill, consumables and cooldowns humans are def superior due to Perception. The orc rogue will be able to win some of the duels, but the human will have the higher win rate.
---
However, when it comes to pvp in general dwarfs, gnomes, undeads and orcs are all superior to humans, with orcs being the strongest.
---
Lmao! I still have sbowballs in my bank. 
---
These people don't care when it releases they aren't impatient for that. They want a date so they can book holidays or some shit. Could be the last day of summer for all they care they just want to know.
---
Rogues are pretty dependent on control for pvp and having a healer with them is not a great combo.  Mage is good because it's a strong solo class in pvp and brings a lot to a 5 man.  
---
Overall I'd argue nothing truly pairs amazingly with a rogue, except maybe another rogue, in pvp.  In PVE all the only issue I can see is maybe needing a class that is desired to help the 2 of you get into groups/raids.
---
That's not how math works. The orc has a 25% chance to resist the first stun, and a 25% chance to resist the second stun. There is a 1/16 chance (1/4 * 1/4) that the orc will resist both the cheap shot and the kidney shot combo. or 9/16 chance to get hit by both.
---
Adding together the percent chance like you did is not how you calculate the possibility of getting the stun resisted. I'm not a mathematician so I can't explain in a way that makes better sense.
---
It was fixed in late TBC.
---
Source: I have hundreds of hours of footage of wall jumping in TBC.
---
Bro. 9/16... vs 50 percent?   
---
Who cares? 
---
&gt;idk why to go redridge at all. elwynn - westfall - **duskwood**. grind some mobs and do few dungeons before going fully dusk. or could always swap to loch modan and wetlands
---
Maybe because I don't want to shit myself?
---
/s  
---
Legit though, when I was in highschool Duskwood just completely scared the bejeezus out of me. I was a nervous wreck the whole time I was there, and I LOVED it. 
---
It is literally impossible for a Rogue to re-open on any Druid thanks to Feral Faerie Fire. They can't even enter stealth to re-open on you. The best they can do is Blind, mount up, and run away.
---
It wasn’t a horse it was a frost saber. That should fix the google search to reveal it. Think there’s a YouTube video of the old g4 show cheat talking about it.
---
I didn't know that was a thing!  Thank you!  :D
---
I'm happy that they provide updates at all despite the backlash they get sometimes. Imagine how much more pissed these people would be if they didn't inform at all and just dumped all the surprises on them at launch.
---
Not how statistics works. Each event is separate. You have to look at it another way.
---
TL;DR: assuming 2 stuns in a row, 6.25% chance both are resisted, 56.25% chance neither get resisted, and 43.75% chance at least one of the two are resisted.
---
------------------------------------------------------------------------
---
There is a 25% or 1 in 4 chance.
---
Look at it this way each has 4 options: resist, hit, hit, hit.
---
Therefore there are 16 possible combinations if both CS and KS are used once a piece. 
---
Both resist chance: 1/4x1/4=1/16. 1 time out of 16 duels, both should be resisted.
---
Both hit chance: 3/4x3/4=9/16. 9 times out of 16 neither should be resisted. Therefore 7 times out of 16, at least one should be resisted
---
&gt;d 43.75%
---
My bad I was off by 6 percent. I stand corrected.
---
BUT BUT. KUNGFU PANDA XPAC!
---
B-b-but I WANT IT MY WAY &gt;:(
---
that's 9/16 (56.25%) that the orc WILL be hit by BOTH stuns. You basically said that there is a 50% chance that the orc is going to resist the stuns when the number is 37.5%. I figured you'd care since you're the dumbass that is telling the top comment that "I hope you're not being serious 2 stuns at 25% is totes 50% omg noob" Thought I guess internet trolls have nothing better to do
---
That should be enough for Classic, but during some open world events like opening the AQ gates you may have to temporarily lower your graphics. And by the looks of it you can always upgrade RAM and the SSD down the road if necessary.
---
Building a desktop will get you a lot more power for your money though. But as you mentioned that being mobile is key, that laptop is not a bad choice. I wish that WoW would be released slightly later, so that I could recommend you to wait for the Icelake release and GTX 16XX to trickle down to laptops.
---
&gt; Lets take the official AV post for example. Everyone is bitching and moaning they are not getting 1.8. Boo fucking hoo. 99% of y'all are just going in AV to get exalted for whatever piece of gear you want, and will probably not look back.
---
None of those people are complaining about 1.12.
---
&gt;  YES doing day long AVs were fun the FIRST time you did it, but believe me, you won't want it the 10th time youre coming to play and really just need that 10k rep for your offhand or mace. Just be happy you're getting an AV without reinforcement and stop bitching at Blizzard.
---
See, you're one of *those people*.  What you really wanted to do was make a post saying everyone that wanted Old AV was wrong, without making it seem like it.
---
Nope. I said there is a 50 percent chance the Orc will ignore at least one of the stuns. Turns out it's 43.75 percent chance.
---
The top comment couldn't read, and apparently I can't do math.
---
For real. I cringe especially hard at the comments “this change has made me reconsider if I’ll play classic at all”. As if Blizzard will read that threat and reconsider its announcement. 
---
That was also the time activision acquired blizzard, and pushed "accessibility".
---
Some MBA thought itd be a great idea to get more bang for their buck by letting everyone see raids, without any understanding of what that would do to the game and its rewards structure.
---
Disc/Holy priest might be the way to go for you then. 
---
MVP
---
Good stuff. And you right it is a lot cheaper to get external space 
---
I didn’t quest there, was just to creepy/scary. Super crazy how immersed I’d get back then 
---
Arms tends to be more effective than fury in pvp for a few reasons.
---
First and foremost is mortal strike. Not only does it hit hard, it reduces healing taken by the target, making self heal classes less effective against them.
---
Secondly, they have improved hamstring, giving a chance to immobilize their target as well as slow them. That alone will make a mage want to blink or ice block, then you can intercept, taking away their awesome get-away tool.
---
Thirdly, they have tactical mastery, making it easier to change stances, berserker rage &amp; intercept, charge &amp; overpower, disarm &amp; shield block are a few examples of those you need to be in a specific stance to use, and without tactical mastery, you end up with 0 rage when you change stances.
---
Many more bonuses to arms, but those IMO are 3 of the biggest as far as pvp goes.
---
Do not get a laptop without a SSD. Since it's 1TB it's unlikely it's a SSD.
---
99% won’t even make it to 60 for AV anyway. 
---
Love to see the boomy in there. I really hope people have the courage to play whatever class they like despite the constant put-downs by min/maxing pserver players. 
---
&gt; This post may upset y'all but see it through.  
---
&gt; typical self important bs.
---
&gt; Can you all just be happy for once? My God, we are actually getting official servers to play Vanilla WoW on...  
---
Trash argument, if we would've been "just happy" we would've gotten 4 content release stages.  
---
&gt; AV update as an example of the community "bitching".  
---
We've gotten 2 updates that actually matter in regards of the game play.  
---
* The first one, about the content stages was loved by the community.  
---
* The second one, about the the AV has been a mixed bag.  
---
* The RP pvp "update" doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things.  
---
Your argument makes zero sense so far.  
---
&gt; Lastly on my soapbox, I'd like to bring the issue of sharding...  
---
Ah, here we go, the actual reason why you decided to grace us with your post.  
---
Maybe you should take your own advice. Stop being a little bitch and make a post about sharding, instead of putting it in this nonsensical garbage.
---
I liked Warlock t1 and 2 :D
---
Warriors are one of the classes that benefit the most from gear, and from party members. No self heals, no dispels, no ranged attacks apart from single shots from ranged weapon and intercept, high chance of being kited.
---
With a healer (especially priest, shaman or paladin), a warrior is haaaaaaaaaard to deal with by the opposite faction.
---
First laughter. Then sadness, then they will laugh again at how ridiculous all the wiping is becoming...
---
Circle of wipes.
---
Dusk Wood was the 1st time most alliance players saw a boss for the 1st time, stitches, and trying to kite it back to town for the guards to kill. 
---
Rep isn't the important factor, honour is. Honour needs to be changed to be just as optimal for long fights without the game ending.
---
I played on an RPPVP server in vanilla and tbc. TBH it was indistinguishable from a regular PVP server. I very very rarely saw RP events happening. In theory it is the best of both worlds, but in practice people who are serious about RP role on an RP realm. 
---
35 lbs since November.  Way to go us!
---
51*
---
Thank god for Grid. As a fellow healer of back then, I sympathize with your GUI layout.
---
Also screens were much smaller then, so there was less space to work with.
---
Go post; I just did. I'm not currently subbed. It's a free play weekend for all, minus BfA, if that matters.
---
Regarding the RP-PVP servers, it's not that 'suddenly' everyone is an RPer, it's the entire RP community speaking up on something that we assumed would be in the game. We haven't really talked about it previously because it wasn't mentioned. Also, for many, the Horde-Alliance conflict is an essential aspect of RP in the game. Not being able to engage in world PVP removes a lot of roleplaying opportunities. 
---
I'm still going to play classic, but I just want to help make blizzard aware that the RP-PVP community is large enough to warrant them making at least one server (which I guarantee will have a much larger population than any PVE server)
---
It comes with both 128 GB solid state drive and hdd 1tb 
---
Hah! I can respect that. One guy commented that they'd rather level in Duskwood than Redridge Mountains. I was like wait, WHAT!? Redridge was so pleasant, as long as you ignore the Horde... :P 
---
I rather enjoyed leveling my warrior.  Make sure you go alchemy for the health pots or you will have a bad time.
---
At Burger King, you’re family
---
Berserking is potentially useless in PvP if you're getting attacked because of either pushback or interrupts. Berserking is potentially useless in PvE because you can get heal sniped. From pure min/max on paper perspective, yes it's better for healing but in practical application? Maybe not.
---
If you're playing shadow priest then berserking is only good for mind blast which you will cast once, maybe twice during the duration. Berserking does not affect mind flay because it affects "casting speed" not haste. And mind flay is a channel not a cast.
---
Troll priests are better vs melee and undead priests are better vs fear classes. Obv these are only horde side. I'd argue a dwarf shadow priest is far better vs rogues than a troll shadow priest because they can break the blind and bleeds. 
---
Blind being the biggest way a rogue can heal up via bandages, stoneforming out of it is a massive win for the priest.
---
We could go all day back and forth on the subject but it's really personal preference. I give troll shadow priest the edge because leveling is easier vs melee mobs, but undead get cannibalize for leveling as well. 
---
BATHROOM NUKAGE INBOUND!!! Take cover, it’s over!!!
---
Yeah it can be upgraded. I'm still going to wait a little bit before I make a purchase so it will give me more time to look. 
---
I enjoyed every moment of World PvP with my warrior.  I didn't enjoy BGs much unless I had a healer because I'd get endlessly CCed by multiple people but with a healer, it was pretty much god mode.  Other warriors I knew were quite effective in BGs without a healer mostly by using engineering tricks.
---
Procs from abilities. Having a faster weapon isn't going to make you use Bloodthirst/Overpower/Whirlwind more often in a fight. You would get the same amount of HoJ procs from those abilities regardless of weapon speed, on average.
---
If you would get say, 2 HoJ procs from abilities alone in a fight, then those two HoJ procs would hit harder with a slower MH.
---
Oh and I'm no furywar expert, but I'm pretty sure fast weapons would eat Flurry procs much faster, which would hurt your DPS a bit as well. It's the same logic as above. You would get Flurry procs from white swings and use those regardless of weapon speed, but the amount of Flurry procs you'll get from your abilities isn't based on your weapon speed, and you'd have less Flurry uptime as a result.
---
You think they’ll make it to 51?
---
It would probably be best to spend all your CP on burst against the orc but i think opening with cheap shot would still be worth it and if it fails pop evasion. Perception basically trades for the opponents vanish.
---
You didn't have to be 60 to get into AV.
---
At this point you know they are sitting around at Blizz HQ finishing up classic...
---
“When should we release this thing, anyway?”
---
“Eh, I don’t know, could do it whenever.”
---
“They keep saying July 16th on reddit, should we just go with that for the lols?”
---
“Yeah sure”
---
I had a great lively crazy casual raiding back then. I hope to find something like that again. Granted I’m kinda shy but still was great fun with then.
---
I am already practicing for ninjalooting all the coins in ZG
---
No
---
My bad, I saw $700 laptop and 1TB and jumped the gun to comment.
---
In one of the patches, 1.10 IIRC, they did something they called "attack power normalization", which is an odd little thing.
---
TL;DR: after this patch, slower swing speed on main hand weapons still mattered, just less than before.
---
They changed the way instant attack abilities calculated damage. Let's name some variables. Call weapon dps W. Call attack power dps A. Call swing speed S.
---
Originally, calculation worked something like this: (W+A)*S.
---
After normalization, they tweaked things a bit. The attack power dps, A, was no longer multiplied by the swing speed S, but was instead multiplied by a specific number based on the type of weapon. 
---
IIRC, the numbers were: 1.8 for daggers, 2.7 for other one handers, 3.6 for 2 handers.
---
Now, for a non dagger one hand weapon, the calculation would be W*S+A*2.7, so swing speed mattered a lot less. Equal weapon dps, the slow weapon still did more damage, but not by a huge margin.
---
I definitely agree with the message, but another thing to keep in mind is that reddit is not just one homogeneous being. This subreddit is made up of 60,000 people, all with their own expectations of what Classic should be and what is special to them. With that in mind, there may be some who take up arms to the AV changes because that is their domain. Others may find a battle with the recent RP news because that is what they were looking forward to in Vanilla. 
---
At the end of the day, people (especially those within this subreddit) are going to voice their opinions, because every person here is passionate about the game and what they want it to be (for better or for worse). Just because there are 150 comments on an AV thread and 150 on an RP-PVP thread doesn't mean that there are 150 or even 100 people bitching about both of those topics. When people see updates regarding aspects they're passionate about, they're going to be vocal about it. I've seen it in every video game subreddit I've subbed to. This isn't a justification, but just a reminder to keep the apparent outrage to each new blue post in perspective.
---
Hook the bike up to a generator and plug the PC into that.  Stop pedaling, PC turns off.
---
That might work better, because I'm hoping to roll horde. 
---
Thank you. I thought I was the only one that felt this way. I can’t stand seeing people complain about every little thing, I come to this sub to get hyped about a game I love, not to hear a bunch of people whining about dumb shit. 
---
Amazing how everyone is an RP-PvP’er all of a sudden. Like for the 1% who actually RP I’m sorry, but I guarantee 99% of the community has only ever been to the Goldshire Inn on Moonguard one time, got a weird boner, and never went back again.
---
Also can we stop picking on the “content creator” dudes on YouTube? When did we all start hating them again? I don’t watch them but no one is forcing me to go watch them either. They’re legit just a few guys who like vanilla WoW and wanna make videos about it, what’s wrong with that. Stop being toxic. Keep that shit on retail please, don’t bring it with you to Classic.
---
This doesn't really factor in time to kill of mobs and how many mobs you could in practice kill per hour. It doesn't matter if you get more exp per hour by killing a higher level mob over a lower level mob if you can kill 20 lower level mobs for 10 higher mobs. It would be best to calculate the amount of mobs on average you can kill in an hour with 57,58,59, and 60 mobs for a level 59, then multiply by the amount of exp you get per level mob. This would give you a reasonable answer on what level of mob is better for farming.
---
Interesting, however probably pointless as to my knowledge there isn’t a steady flow of same level mobs anywhere. When grinding you’ll be constantly finding mobs with a 2-3 level range
---
After watching and studying all the tactics for every boss in vanilla, C'thun is by far the scariest for me, and the boss I fear most in the entire game as far as my own ability to perform properly.  
---
All I doing is supporting Blizzard in their decisions. Yes, I have my own tidbits thrown in there, but in the end I'm SUPPORTING them instead of just bitching like this subreddit does. It's disgusting.
---
Best class to compliment a rogue is another rogue. Alternatively I'd say possibly a druid because they could be stealth bros and the healing would be nice in a pinch.
---
Here's the actual reason warriors wanted 2 slow 1 hand weapons. **Flurry**.
---
Flurry gives you a bonus speed to the next 5 attacks after a crit. Since your instant attacks can crit, as well as your auto attacks, slower weapons means higher up time. Faster attacks from flurry means more rage. More rage means more often for instant attacks. More instant attacks means more crits, means even more flurry.
---
2 slow weapons give more rage, which is a feedback loop, pushing damage higher just because of the mechanics of the class.
---
The same mechanic is the same reason fury gets so bonkers with higher and higher gear. More crit means more flurry and more rage. More hit chance means more rage gained and more chances to crit, so more flurry, so more rage. Every dps increase stat synergies with all the others in a way that none of the other classes do.
---
right like in what world is it unreasonable to assume these server types that were in the game since vanilla would be here? should the pvp-er's speak out immediately lest pvp servers become too much of a niche audience to support? jesus christ
---
All good. I saw some better laptops for the same price but they all had hdd.. disappointing 
---
Old AV is not wrong, but it's not the decision Blizzard made. Personally, IDGAF what patch AV is on, I'm going in there to get exalted and leaving, but the decision they made is 1.12.1 and we should be happy with that instead of just bitching.
---
Bitching about them got content drop buckets changed.
---
Oh look, another shitpost.  Nothing to see here.
---
Was very interested in the past but I dont know much about any of that haha 
---
Well, they still have a point, and when you reach content that is gated behind raid DPS whilst dragging along oomkins and other underperfoming hybrids, the mood can spiral downwards pretty quickly.
---
I've always liked bloodfang more than bonescythe for the aesthetics.
---
I second that
---
I hate that trolls either are so awkward they can't even stand up while not walking, or look like a SJW.
---
You're right, but mostly my post is about just being grateful as a community instead of all the whining that is going on 24/7. People bitch about noting getting a release date or updates and I don't blame Blizzard based on how the subreddit and the forums behave. How are we ever going to get a release if everyone is blatantly upset all the time with Blizzards decisions. 
---
"succulent lowbies"
---
I just imagined some plump jumbo shrimp at red lobster. From now on I'll refer to them as succulent lowbies when I order them. 
---
Maybe I'll wink at the waiter or waitress then laugh giving them a "you know what I mean?"
---
For higher level mobs the equation is:
---
XP = (Base XP) * (1 + 0.05 * (Mob Level - Char Level) )
---
Math for dummies: 5% more xp for every level higher. level 11 vs level 11 mob is 100xp. 11 vs 12 mob is 105xp. There's a cap at +4, or 20%
---
[Easy spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uKoDsBcJQ_N-rbT-zcnLPz7sfVTZoTy5gpQCLviK2Vw/edit?usp=sharing) - only pay attention to XP Per Mob tab - the rest are other projects.
---
Left side is level, and mob XP for even level through +4 --- right side is lower level mob xp. 
---
the 20/21 split from your chart confirms the same for the 5% (21 even level = 20 +1 mobs) If you can kill +1 5% faster, do that. Chances are evens or 1 to 2 lower are your best bet.
---
Do you ever think that maybe some of us want to play RP-PvP but didn’t really talk about it, assuming it would be there? But now that it’s not there’s reason to speak up about it and that’s why it seems like “everyone” is a role player? But really all these people always wanted to play rppvp?
---
Fury warriors have tactical mastery too
---
This might sound boner, but this... ah fuck it can I have karma 
---
Totaly agree, more mature, more immersive, more fun for me
---
For pve, will is really strong in a few fights too, like magmadar or onyxia, when they fear.
---
&gt; we should be happy with that instead of just bitching.
---
That's stupid.  I shouldn't be happy that the majority of the people I run into in AV are only their to get their rewards.  That makes for garbage PVP.  Why should I be happy with garbage?
---
At first I read, "I can't even imagine 2 druids levelling..."
---
My favorite is how everyone keeps talking about what comes after classic; We talk about if there will be TBC after classic or new developed content. But.. we haven't even gotten to play actual classic wow yet and we keep talking about what happens AFTER classic
---
Warriors have the best looking Tier set at each tier. Don’t @ me. 
---
I agree. I was looking forward to living on an RP-PVP realm.    
---
I was also thinking it would be nice to keep the mentioning of internet resources out of every conversation when asking people for advice (or at least lessening it). "I came across a brave fellow who was defeated in battle but managed to survive. Sadly, he does not know what happened to his wife. By chance, have you come across a lady who has been separated from her husband?"
---
Perception is only 20 seconds. So as Orc you just wait for it to run out and the game is even, except you still have the chance to resist a stun. Therefore Orc wins. 
---
Both are fun when geared, or with a healer. Killing people in a few massive hits is very satisfying. Without a healer or heavy use of free action potions, expect to get kited/stunlocked and focused down heavily in most bgs 
---
Warrior Moght helmet is pretty bland. Good thing you can turn it off. 
---
No he's making a consolidated argument regarding the regular bitching of this subreddit and using some of the latest examples of such as precedent. 
---
You need to chill with the thinly veiled insults towards OP and come up with a better defensive platform other than : " no you!"
---
Pocket healer makes or breaks the warrior indeed. I remember this fkn female gnome fury warrior in AB on my server that wielded Maladath, Runed Blade of the Black Flight + Nightmare Blade, that also had pocket healers. Could literally do nothing (I believe I was in MC gear and BWL was the highest tier available at the time).
---
But you *can* be awesome in PvP even when solo though. At least when fighting melee and retaliation is off cooldown.
---
#CAN'T STAND YA!
---
Holy paladin is very robust, can easily do pvp abs pve with the same spec. You’ll be more effective with a different spec, but it is very playable and still strong without a pvp spec 
---
I totally get that and am probably a bit harsh in my post, but man I've played on shitty private servers for almost 10 years now and honestly can't wait to see what Blizzard has is store for us, even if it means sacrificing a few niche things that people are getting upset about. There are few posts thanks Blizzard and 10001 posts criticizing them because it's not how THEY want it. I don't care what they give us. Give me 1.8 AV or 1.12 IDC. Give me sharding, dont give me sharding IDC. I just want to play an authentic server again. 
---
Funny thing is few people except forum warriors would be mad. Everyone would so happy their logged in official servers that these minor details would be irrelevant.
---
Is making a post to complain about people making posts to complain is like rain on your wedding day?
---
All jokes aside, this post is on point. Don't mess around with your health.
---
I remember my RP-PVP(venture co.) server didnt RP at all back in the day. 
---
The op was talking leveling 1-20 in the first night of launch with all it's bugs, server crashes, and overcrowded-ness. Not lvl 1-20 on any other night after the hype is gone.
---
Took my guild 3 months to down razorgore.  My raider leader kept changing the strategy around so we'd get only 1 pull every 45-60mins in 3 hour raid once a week raid.  It was infuriating because it was clear by the third attempt that the problem wasn't the strategy, it was that our players lack experience and skill to fight a complex boss like Razogore.  
---
What we really needed was to hit the boss, over and over again 6-8 attempts a night until everyone could do their job right.
---
On the plus side we beat Vael like a rented mule once we got Razorgore down.
---
Somebody's still salty about AV changing 15 years ago
---
Unless you healed; you were a waste of space at sub 60 in AV
---
Getting back to my point....  3/4 of the people complaining about changes will not even see AV. 
---
I'm not trying to tell you how to play your game, it's all about having fun whichever way you do it, but that's the reality of AV. It may not be for 5% of the population, which is fine, but it's just a reality. 
---
I agree to an extent, but OPs point is that the outrage and petty behavior in the threads tends to outweigh any meaningful discussion.
---
I don't normally play RP servers but have been itching to give a rp-pvp a serious try for Vanilla. Something about having to have appropriate character names and the community have always appealed to me. I have RL friends this time willing to give it a rip, was a bit saddened to see this may not be an option :(
---
Who is still recommending sit ups in 2019? Terrible for you
---
Yep. But if someone doesn't like healing, a holy paladin is a terrible recommendation. Hence needing more info than "what's good for both"
---
Amen. 
---
Oh man, if they only had one 1 RP PVP server, the world pvp would be insane and it would be a very populated server with a ton of faction pride 
---
&gt; TC should hold no innate threat modifier to it as far as I'm aware, where'd you find that?
---
Here are multiple wiki entries that  refer to TC doing about 180 threat per target (130 damage * 1.75 mod * 0.8 stance):
---
https://www.classicwow.live/threat
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Thunder_Clap
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Thunder_Clap
---
If you look at the patch notes: The tooltip first didn't imply that TC did additional threat, which was later changed. Now there must either be a confusion about this or the threat was always high.
---
Your practical example is not really in line with what I started the discussion about. I was specifically talking about AoE clearing. In this case you pull as many mobs together as your group can handle. You won't have any threat saved up because you were sitting/eating/drinking after each pull. It's a very quick way to clear dungeons if you have the right people and classes. You can't slowly Tab with SA to hold aggro, because you pulled a way too large amount of mobs. You have to use as much AoE threat as you can initially with TC and BS so your healer doesn't get instantly dumpstered. You will also most likely not keep up with threat, which is fine because your group is kiting and using AoE so you focus solely on protecting your healer by attacking the mobs closest to your group or you might even cleave with your 2H. Point is you are only concerned with that initial AoE aggro and pulling the mobs into a nice funnel for your DPS to AoE down.
---
&gt; Unless you healed; you were a waste of space at sub 60 in AV
---
Can sum1 help me w quest?
---
Honestly I'm fine with whatever, as long as you have to actually go to Alterac Mountains to queue for it
---
This is the dumbest take of all time, especially the last paragraph, sorry dude.
---
If the community weren't vocal, classic would not even be happening. Now you're telling everyone to stop voicing their opinion. Letting the "big boys" make the decisions is why retail is in such a bad state in the first place. What if everyone stuck their tail in between their legs and went away after "big boy" brack publicly humiliated some poor dude at blizzcon with "you think you do, but you don't"?
---
This is either a troll post or Ion himself...
---
Your math is correct, but you are doing probability, not statistics. 
---
Role playing has always been a niche, I don’t think anyone assumed it would be there. The numbers don’t really lie on this one, the role playing community has always been small, and I don’t think that’s suddenly going to change with the release of Classic. So as I said, I’m sorry to the 1%. 
---
It felt like every response I read on that video was negative though, like Blizzard confirmed RP servers were going to be at launch and said that if there was enough of a following they would add RP-PvP later. Seemed like a good honest answer from the Blizzard devs to me.
---
&gt;As my memory serves, the strat involved shamans frost shock and earthbind totem kiting the dragonkin along with hunters, running in circles around the room while everyone else was in the middle trying to burn all the other adds.
---
My raid never had enough shamans for that.  We used 3-4 hunters kiting dragonkin around.  My record was 9 dragonkin chasing me after a couple of other hunters died(Warlocks were fear kiting 3 others).  I keep them going for over a minute before I ate a fireball from a mage while in cheetah and the dragonkin beat me down and then proceded murdered the raid.  
---
Assuming they go arms. Many raiding fury go into prot for off tank capabilities. As arms, there aren't very many good options to skip at least a couple points in tactical mastery while ranking up in the tree.
---
I thought you were shit posting but now I want to try this
---
I love this little unwritten rule, as compared to my experience as a Rogue.
---
As a Rogue, I murdered other Rogues on sight (or avoided them if I thought I couldn't kill them). There can be only one.
---
Mine's going to be as well! It seems like everyone has got a brother that's going to be an Alchemist.
---
Ah, yes. Good catch, always mix those in my head. Always liked the numbers better than the words they're assigned.
---
This post is embarrassing
---
I hear you and I’m with you, but Blizzard is asking for this.
---
In the RPPVP announcement, Ion said they would gauge feedback from the community. This is that feedback.
---
When they announced the 6 phase plan, they said they’d continue the dialogue with the community. This is that conversation.
---
AV 1.12? I don’t think it was explicitly said; however, they’ve proven themselves to be listening, so now the discussion will never stop.
---
For pve troll is way better.
---
The only server I'd want to play on won't exist.
---
"bunch of god damn babies"
---
It's vital, because people needed to click. If you couldn't click, then you couldn't DPS.
---
god why did i listen to this, the feels are too real.
---
I hope they have the courage to play them too. More importantly I hope raid/guild leaders have the presence of mind to invite the nonmeta specs regardless of streamers screaming about optimizing group comps 
---
Same here, no solution but would like to encourage OP that it's a good idea to pursue.  
---
I was working on something similar, maps for safe passage around hostile mob spawn points. [Example](https://andygriffith.us/WoW/path_around_hostiles.png) and [reddit post about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/av9v8o/noncompete_clause/).
---
That’s kind of what I thought too but heard arguments for both sides
---
The math on 2 25% events don't make a big difference, but it gets way out of hand when you get I to 3 or more. The math you were using would say 4x.25=100%chance to resist one of the stuns, and again, just not how **probability** works.
---
you are not alone in your view on this.
---
I just spit up some Cherry Sprite Zero upon reading “succulent lowbies”.
---
I raided as fury on a private server from MC through to Naxx. We had 8 warriors most raids, with just 2 of them prot spec as main/offtanks. The other 6 were fury, and none had prot offspec. Fury without impale is sub-par dps and not worthwhile bringing to a raid. 
---
Fury/prot is favoured by main tanks who have the gear and skilled healers backing them, to allow them to keep up with threat. 
---
It takes longer to kill a higher level mob. A longer fight means you will use more mana or lose more hp which will increase your downtime. You get a minuscule amount of bonus xp for killing a higher level target, it is not worth it if you can avoid it.
---
&gt;raids have 1 sm-ruin warlock
---
I thought sm-ruin was the go-to pve spec for all warlocks. What other spec do they use for pve?
---
Reputation is not the problem. Before everyone rushed, many people spent a gallon of blood or other repeatable quests in av. you became so freaking fast exalted, because one alterac match lasted hours and you could farm and farm and farm. I did it like this back then. Lokholar and Ivus weren't rare because of this. 
---
The main problem is nobody defends anything at 1.12.
---
I can remember 10-20 alliance player defending stonehearth graveyard and 10-20 horde player defending iceblood graveyard back then. But that was not enough, you had to secure the tower too.
---
If horde got stonehearth graveyard and tapped the tower, two/three people waited at the tower and the rest had to mount till storm pike graveyard to fight again against the same 10-20 defender. This took really really long becaue of these battles. Sometimes you had some genius in your team, who tapped every alliance graveyard and then you fought suddenly with 20-30 players on one side against 40 players on the other side because the frontier army spawned suddenly in the basement. Good times, good fights. 
---
After nerving the npcs the defenders had a tough time. Because of that some groups didn't defend anymore, but not all.
---
Since 2013 I am playing on a private server and played some battlegrounds. AV was good, because many people met in the middle of the map or at graveyards and begun to fight each other. Last time I played av there (~2017) it was like waving at each other and pass them.
---
Would say npc nerfing is partly at fault. 
---
But more so the player attitude. 
---
Whilst a good comment, I'm asking if there has been any news or a confirmed denial of dual talents
---
Totally agree, this sub is by and large a snake pit, but then again so is a lot of Reddit. But I know there are a few chill folks around that aren't losing their minds or acting like a 35 year old teenager, and because of them I hold out hope. Looking forward to Classic whether there are changes or not! :)
---
It works (in dungeons at least). I wouldn't really say you're both tank AND healer, because healers need to heal the DPS from time to time as well. The nuisance is that Hunter Tanks don't really fit nicely into the "Tank, Healer, 3 DPS" setup that has become universal since the rise of online guides and such telling everyone how to play.
---
They work super well in a party of largely hybrids, where most people in the party are geared towards DPS, but can also take a few hits from a boss/heal a player that drops a bit too low. But of course, (almost) nobody is going to play around a team composition that looks like 1 tank/healer hybrid, 1 tank/DPS hybrid, 1 healer/DPS hybrid, and 2 actual DPS. The Holy Trinity is just too ingrained in the mainstream for anything else to work.
---
I'm asking if there has been any news or a confirmed denial of dual talents not your opinion.
---
Not sure how asking for news or a confirmed denial is retail but sure buddy, be toxic.
---
DS-ruin. 
---
Accurately described. Another thing to consider: the 4 hoj attacks from your instant attacks do something other than just doing damage: gain rage.
---
You will gain more rage from those 4 "bonus" hoj attacks with slower weapons than with faster, giving more freedom to use those instant attacks, and to weave in some cleave/heroic strikes.
---
Whilst I appreciate the non toxic response, I'm looking for news or a confirmed denial.
---
Roleplay is where you give your character a fictional persona. It's basically acting a part at all times, except for when a private group or guild says "okay this is one area you don't have to roleplay". 
---
This k of it like nudism but reverse. Normally of you want to live like a nudist you have to be super careful and can only be nude in certain areas. 
---
Imagine if you HAD to be nude in "public" but we're allowed to wear clothes when needed (like say welding or a kitchen). Basically if the Roleplay interferes while your work. 
---
It sounds like that would take a lot of mental effort and for raising and boss fights it can be a bit rough. For general world PvP though rile play is pretty easy and even gives people reasons for behavior that would normally occcur IRL but not in a normal PvP server. 
---
For instance maybe your guild found a super rare Regeanitus at location X (but not really). So they "claim" the area dedicating themselves to not letting anybody else from the opposing faction in. 
---
Now obviously if you hog all of a resource using RP as justification your just a dick like the DevilSaur mafia in the old days. 
---
Anyways say some Horde players do this and now as an alliance you must strike them down to stop a powerful new plague from developing! 
---
It's all pretend and all for fun. It's like Larping in-game. 
---
If your worried about being uncool then just larp secretly and keep it in server. 
---
This is the most disappointing news yet. RPPvP is what makes total immersion in this world possible for me. I hope they reconsider 
---
Creating a system where you offer loot to people that they wont use and don't particularly want but are out nothing by taking it over someone who will use it is a poorly designed system, period.   The system as described values fashion or "transmog" as equal to functional stats at least for the slots that tier goes in.  The system has nothing to do with being social or not min/maxing it has to do with desire to acquire visually appealing gear that is not for a person's chosen spec at an equal rate to those actually playing the appropriate spec at the cost of those other players having to wait for functional gear.
---
Can I help you, sir?
---
Whilst a good comment, looking for actual news or a confirmed denial from Activision.
---
Neither. Human rogue.
---
Trolls will troll. However some perspective, a lot of the most toxic comments I see are in response to a question or recommendation that gets asked 10 times a day. So they aren't so much trying to start shit with you, but continuing the argument they've already had for a while. 
---
I hope everyone steps back and takes a deep breath now and again. 
---
Holy shit thank you, I've been saying this for the past month. Who the fuck cares about AV/ RP-PVP Servers, these people just want to complain about everything, because they feel scorned by blizzard for whatever reason. Can't you people just be happy we get vanilla back and patently wait before jumping to conclusions 
---
&gt; All the sudden EVERYONE is an god damn RPer.
---
You mean reddit isn't the biggest community of RPers, and furries, on the internet?
---
RPPvP does matter to those who of us who want to immerse ourselves in a world and actually RP our character. If there's no RPPvP I could sneak up on a alliance scumbag and not be able to take them out because they have PvP off. That takes away from the danger of the world if you're not looking over your shoulder for enemy combatants. 
---
Twisted Nether brother!
---
Attendance.  Whoever showed up the most in the last 30 days gets the loot.  Ties broken by /roll.
---
"Bonus" attendance given for tough nights (wiping a lot on a new boss) or feats of valor.  Penalties for being a douchebag.
---
It's a simple system that gears up the most active members most quickly.  And new/returning members don't have to feel left in the dust, since can get on the same page as veterans in 30 days or less.
---
I mean, the thing all shadow priests wanted the most was another dot, and UD have it. The Alliance shadow priests I knew wished they had it. IMO all priests need fear ward, and plague, spread one of each racial to all priests. 
---
I learned it back when vanilla was just WoW. There is no faster way to be feel disappointed than to read the forums.  
---
You like your class? Better head to the forums to learn how to get better...oh wait it's just people bitching about the class
---
You like PVP? Better head to the forums to learn how to get better....oh wait it's just people bitching about balance
---
You like WoW? Better head to the forums to learn more about the game you like...oh wait it's just people bitching about everything.
---
Stealthily unzipping those pants...
---
Mildly better is more accurate. The beastslaying helps a very little bit, and berserk is only way better when you're really low hp, like &gt;30% health.
---
Overall, yes it's better, but there are some other fights like onyxia that fear break from will of the forsaken can give you time to cast, and reduces the RNG of walking into her tail. In that fight and others like it I would prefer undead myself. Also, I don't like how trolls look personally.
---
it's 30% chance for orcs to resist btw, because everyone has 5% base chance
---
So, you're asking if there's any news whether a feature from 2010 is going to be in a version of the game that's trying to replicate the 2004-2006 version of the game? No, there hasn't been. There also hasn't been any news or confirmed denial of garrisons in Classic WoW either. The reason why I gave the response I did is because it seemed based on your question that you didn't understand what Classic WoW is trying to be. 
---
I was also thinking a rogue. Torn between rogue and mage. Thought maybe I’d go mage just so we weren’t competing for same gear 
---
The dramaticity in this post alone is enough to kill a guild
---
15+ years of experience and can't keep 40 people to raid.  Sounds like the twilight zone.
---
Also, this thread is pointless.
---
...... Who hurt you so bad?
---
There are a few "sacred cow" topics on classic wow reddit, but most of the posts I've seen actually end up with discussion. Lots and lots of up/down votes, but discussion none the less.
---
What did you want to talk about that got shit on so hard? 
---
[Serious] Fuck you. You don't get to invalidate people's gripes, hopes, and dreams when it comes to their favorite game.
---
A lot of people really wanted RP-PvP servers, so much so that they took it absolutely for granted and their entire guilds planned their game around it. And now the rug is suddenly yanked away.
---
People have every single right to express their opinion. This is capitalism, democracy. The consumer has a say. It's not just "let the corporation big boys make the decisions."
---
Fuck you for being so inconsiderate.
---
I didn't get the impression from the interview that they'd thought about or done any research into how popular these things were.
---
I see what you mean, however, that is completely a unnecessary option for buffing ret paladins.
---
To make ret viable, the devs would have to tackle the problem directly. And that could be in a couple of ways but the best one would be where it wont cause any trouble with other factors in the game like gear or other classes.
---
People on twitter injoy irl pvp
---
It's not letting me do it. It's not free for me, you sure about the free thing? I never bought BfA, I haven't had an active sub since Retail Vanilla. Nothing is showing up.
---
Oh well, seems like there are enough intelligent and vocal people making very good points, like pointing to surveys (insane Blizzard is ignorant of this) showing that a sizable portion of people intend on rolling on RP-PvP servers.
---
I lvled as a prot warrior and didnt think anything of it because it was all I knew, never had any problems finding instance groups that's a bonus lol 
---
Sure it was slower but along the way I met a great bunch of guilds and friendships that lasted all of vanilla and into BC which I leveled as prot too and lasted well into main tanking the raids in BC 
---
I'll be leveling as prot once classic releases without a doubt it's my home talent tree 
---
The worst responses I've seen lately is just "no" without any discussion or explanation. Most of the "go back to retail" or "get off my lawn" type responses have mostly dried up for not getting any drama feedback lately.
---
That's where you're wrong, kiddo. Just got off a live chat with a Blizzard agent and they told me you need an active sub and a lvl 10 character. I only have the latter.
---
I think you underestimate how many people played WoW early on.  It was kind of a big deal.  It seems like "very few" because 99% of them quit, like, 10 years ago.
---
Or just downvotes to hell without any responses.
---
Do do do do, do do do do.....
---
Didn't think you could be more toxic but you surprised me yet again.
---
Lucky for me right!
---
&gt; Role playing has always been a niche, I don’t think anyone assumed it would be there
---
You didn't put much thought into this then.  The guy you replied to assumed they'd be there.  They were in Vanilla.  They were in Vanilla in 1.12.  FFS.
---
Toxic forums is part of ~~vanilla~~ online experience.
---
Yet I am currently able to post despite not having an active sub since the launch of BFA? 🤔
---
100% support you on this, no matter what decision blizz makes they are stepping on someones toes and just because you cry the loudest doesnt mean you are a majority or that blizz should listen to you.
---
Of the 20 ppl i have heard say are going to rp pvp server 19 are going bc they want pvp and a mature server, not to fucking rp. The irony in all this is that ppl argue player entitilement killed wow and here we fucking all are at the starting line repeating history lmfao
---
.... RP/PVP server... I'm trying to imagine what happens there. I'm guessing an orc gets killed in goldshire and people pretend to have sex on it's dead body?
---
How close am I? 
---
Bahahaha good work
---
Trolls can be mages?!?
---
Lmfao get over it. Go rp on a pvp server. No one is going to stop you. 
---
As an herbalist in vanilla: there were better places to farm herbs.  And to fish, for that matter.
---
I'd wait and see.  I got the impression from the interview that they hadn't thought about it much, and I expect that they'll add RP-PVP servers when they see the community reaction.
---
In terms of the game's history, there were RP servers at the game's launch while RP-PVP servers weren't added until later, although not a lot later, apparently they were still added before 1.12.  So I guess they're just thinking in terms of RP servers are the default, since those were in at launch. I don't get the impression that they thought it through further than that.
---
I'm the opposite: I'm looking forward to an RP-PvE server, and I'd never play on any PvP server.  But I hope you guys get your RP-PvP servers:  you guys get more fun, and as long as you're playing on another server it doesn't hurt me.
---
Yes you are.  You are saying "Have fun the way Blizzard tells you to, and don't complain about it."
---
Also true! There are so many things that favor fast weapons, but for Warriors it is even more so. 
---
Possible for sure, based on the dungeon.
---
When it would suck is when you have one of those packs of 7+ mobs the warrior would gather with demo / battle shouts. I.E. end of scholomance.
---
When the pet goes in, there's no pet aoe (maybe gorillas), so any healing you do, you're the default target of all the rest, who haven't already been pulled off by any other aoe.
---
Thank God, somebody sees it as I do. I couldn't agree more about all these cry babies. It's just this generation, I'm 26 and was just as young as most people when they first started WoW, don't take this for granted. Be fucking happy we're getting the game, it's ok to be passionate but pick your battles. You can't just get unhinged after every fucking decision. Just accept it, unless it's mindblowingly fucking terrible which isn't the case. Figure it out. 
---
Hopefully you didn't get it all over your BenQ Ultra 4KHD 240Hz Monitor.
---
Man, I'm legitimately trying to help you out here. I'm sorry you're taking it so harshly. I'm not meaning to be too much of a dick, although I admit that the "garrisons" comment was a bit mean. 
---
Yep, I remember when I was grinding out Commander to get my cheap epic mount, a few of the higher-ranked guys would just sit above the graveyards in AV for hours, racking up hundreds of HKs.
---
That's hardcore. Like darksouls level need to be on drugs hardcore.
---
I showed up too late. (Though the post is only 30 minutes old, and already deleted). What did the rest of the post say? 
---
&gt;The VERY VERY FEW who actually played it back then
---
lol you talk like WoW was some obscure game.  It was a mega-hit right from the get-go.  Plenty of people played AV when it came out and know that it got worse after every single change.  I don't really care which version they use, but stop being disingenuous.
---
Unless you're looking to get into a raid within the first month of release, where everyone is half greens still, or in a cutting edge guild, there's no reason to NEED a cookie cutter PvE spec.
---
Choose a class you want to play, and play around with talents on a calculator. Custom make one for the things you want to be able to do. That's one of the most fun things to do when you're not actually playing, is to plan how to do what you like better.
---
You can vanish in stealth to be harder to find or wait it out so perception is not as big as you think in the mirror. 
---
Perception is VERY strong in premades though because your job as a rogue is to harass/find the druid flag carrier or ninja nodes which are often guarded from stealth. You are gonna be more valuable to the team as human. 
---
Play what you want. If you are good on a rogue you are good on a rogue. See WOTF being used here? Nope. Rogues are a pressure class like mages. They are the least race dependent classes in the game outside premade BG's because when you are controlling a fight and using consumables and trinkets you shouldn't need the racials. If you are running around out of stealth on a rogue in a BG against GOOD players? Good luck with that. Might want to consider playing a warrior. :)

I mean if you want a min max list though here it is.
---
PVE Human and Orc
---
BG's Human and Orc, but dwarfs and undead are fine in pugs and gnomes are really strong at low levels and pretty decent if hemo and not daggers.
---
WPVP. Dwarf is probably best because you will have your life saved A LOT because "1v1" doesn't exist on populated servers. Orc and Undead are pretty even. 
---
I personally always played undead because I love their animations. I also really like female human animations. If model changers like tmorph still worked in modern WoW/Classic I would gladly be Orc or Dwarf. Without them? Not really. I am not going to stare at orc shoulderpads on a rogue. Would drive me crazy.
---
I won't play unless there is RP-PVP
---
He labeled numerous comments in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b3sfi7/dual_talents/) as toxic. Make of that what you will. 
---
Spiders, ghouls, creepy SFX/BGM, creepy everything. 
---
Least favorite spot on Azeroth.
---
It's more scary if your a class with aoe... tag an unseen and instantly get murdered. Good times... sadly a mechanic like that is too harsh for the special snowflake players of today.
---
It’s a PVP server with less toxicity. 
---
I played Mists and WoD. The bad class design started in Cata and troughed in Legion. The cash shop has routinely taken resources away from main development, the most notable example of which is removing Karabor and Bladespire as the main faction cities of WoD. 
---
The lore I've always followed. Hollllllllllly shit. I was a WC3 nerd who beat A Symphony of Frost and Flame long before WoW came out. I'm a hipster that was already beyond pissed with the assassination of Kael's character.
---
First server was RP-PVP... Emerald Dream I think? 
---
Barely anyone RPed. Like everyone else is saying it might as well have been a PVP server. If you want to RP you had to go to RP-PVE. 
---
I mean, I don't think it's bad to provide Blizzard with feedback, as long as we also give credit where it's due, and I'm seeing enough positive posts about vanilla WoW to think that is happening. Additionally, that blue post last week about the content roll-out plan had an extremely positive response. So it's not like it's just pure negativity bias. 
---
That said, there is some unnecessary hostility at times, that much is true. 
---
The  purple crystal armor from BC wasn’t bad, in retrospect. At the time it was gross though. T4 I think? But yeah judgement was sick, had the helmet and that was enough for me lol
---
Rep is huge. You can get crazy good gear from the rep vendors.
---
Redridge is an integral part of the leveling experience.  Even if you do virtually all quests there, you won't get too far ahead.   
---
-Elwynn  (optional Dun Morogh for a few level ~9-11 quests + loch modan fp)  
---
-Westfall  
---
-Loch Modan  
---
-Westfall (finish most quests)  
---
-Redridge (finishing up defias questline + couple low quests)  
---
-Duskwood wolves/spiders quests  
---
-Deadmines full quest run  
---
-Redridge (til 23ish)  
---
-Duskwood til 24ish (grab all Stockades quests)  
---
-Stockades full quest run    
---
-Redridge - finish all elite quests  
---
-Duskwood - should be about 27 now, finish up here.  
---
Wetlands usually comes at this point, even though some of the early quests will already be green.  Clean up most of wetlands and head to STV level ~30.  
---
"If someone cant do that many pushups, sure it might not be the most effective way to train, but its not going to hurt them if they try their damned hardest to get all those reps."
---
I admire your attitude to not make excuses for yourself but my aunt fucked up her wrist trying to do pushups. I've also seen it happen when I went to basic with a bunch of fatass WoW playing eggheads like myself. One kid fucked up his wrist doing pushups **properly** because they pushed him too hard. 
---
His back was fine. His shoulders were fine. His legs were fine. His wrist was not. 
---
The army had to change a lot after Iraq because soany people got I hired doing basic excersize. There are many limp-wristed fatasses out their who need to start pushups on their knees and keep it down ton&lt;10 for the first week so they don't damage their wrists. 
---
Typically these folks don't do physical labor, never did, and never played sports growing up. So, ya know, people who were kids during retail wow and never played sports. 
---
"[experience the full game](https://tenor.com/view/funny-fuck-off-dancing-gif-9795114)"
---
Slow weapons. The only class that favors fast weapons are rogues, for offhand poison procs.
---
It tells you pserver players are more into pvp
---
Well, darn. Thanks for trying.  
---
There's definitely plenty of attention and talk being made over it. Let's hope for the best.
---
I'm just happy to get any rp server. I was worried they wouldn't confirm this sort of thing at all. 
---
Ion's involved in the Classic rollout?
---
It's fucking doomed...
---
I'm so glad we didn't make a fuss about the 4 content phases.
---
It's not about using your muscles souch that they disintegrate or you get sick. 
---
It's about being so weak that your wrists can't support your bodyweight because you work tech support and never excersize. For some people the heaviest thing they lift up is a gallon of milk. 
---
u/[deleted]... guess he didn't like how people didn't just blindly agree with his random outburst.
---
Great, now someone is going to make a stop complaining about the complainer complainers.
---
If it wasnt in 1.12, it aint in it.
---
"  It doesn't matter if you get more exp per hour by killing a higher level mob over a lower level mob if you can kill 20 lower level mobs for 10 higher mobs. "  
---
... Thats exactly what this was saying. You have to calculate your time to kill individually, and showing you how many more mobs you would have to kill to make it worth.
---
A thread with 170 odd comments and OP reveals in his comments that he was levelling a warrior in wotlk rather than classic (taunt from distance LOL). And people argue with me about the quality of this sub dropping.
---
Hunter tank&gt;pet tank. You can get sick avoidance+health from surv talents. Slap a WF totem on your 2-hander and wing clip spam to keep threat. Easy AoE threat with explosive traps as well. Massive threat on pulls with Aimed--&gt;Multi--&gt;Distracting. 
---
I've also tanked all 4 marshalls as a stupid hunter because we had 5 healers and no tanks up north once. Tried to tank Vann but died 20% in and it was a shitshow where we had mages and hunters trying to kite him around while slowly killing him.

Blizzard quality.

Stop complaining about complaining about complaining about complaining about complaining about complaining about complainers 
---
I've seen too many posts recently of people ranting about complaining about the toxicity in this sub. To these people I want to say that you're contributing nothing to the conversation and you're just adding to the toxicity.
---
How about you create a positive post for a change and leave the people complaining about #nochanges virgins alone? These are people with literally no life so they're not worth your attention anyways. Focus on things that are actually important for christ's sake.
---
Stop complaining about people wanting to make threads telling others to stop complaining about the complainer complainers!
---
I currently do push ups every flight path. 10 base, plus 5-10 per each connection I travel through. Boats are 15. Working on including a 1.5mi run somewhere in the routine, but I typically just do it once a day when I get bored with the current grind and need a break.
---
Oops, swapped words. 
---
Criticism not allowed; Be grateful for the product that you're paying them for.   
---
I've got a bridge in New York to sell you, by the way.
---
Nah, I was leveling in classic. I also leveled a warrior in TBC, Wrath, Cata, and every other expansion. The taunt thing was an error. I was pulling with ranged weapons in classic. Thanks for the reply!
---
Back on the retail servers (high-pop realm, first PvP realm to open the gates), it was pretty bad.
---
I missed the gong event on my server, but when a couple Alliance guilds showed up in Moonglade to stop the Horde from completing the Eranikus quest, the server slowed to a tick rate of 10+ seconds with severe rubber-banding, before finally crashing completely.  Then it was rebooted, and everyone logged back on and crashed it again.
---
But, server technology has advanced a hell of a lot in the last 15 years.  It should be no problem today.
---
No, no. Better say nothing. We don't want to upset the people who are here to get hyped.
---
Complaining about the state of the game is far better than a post bitcjing about players. People have been waiting years for the potential of playing the glory days of wow, they are naturally going to still be passionate about the state of the game on relesse. I would much rather see there concerns than you being butthurt about them not being content with design decisions. It's posts like this that led to the current foul state of the current mmorpg that currently exists.
---
I can't say I've ever hit level 12 off Elwynn alone, and that's doing every quest too. 
---
Played on emerald dream on retail up until about a month ago, this is spot on. 
---
This looks correct. Anybody who says they're doing Elwynn into Westfall into Redridge is either lying or grinding levels in between. 
---
It's kind of strange to me that folks think the Human ALWAYS gets the opener. It's a 20 second duration and a 3 minute cooldown. I guess it's assuming the two start at 20 paces with all cooldowns ready and walk toward each other. I just don't see the Orc always being seen with an ability that has a 10% uptime.
---
&gt;NE has better racials imo
---
How do you figure? Shadowmeld is useless because you have cat stealth anyway. Dodge is one of those 'okay' stats but won't make a huge difference. Compare any of that with Warstomp.
---
&gt;Trash argument, if we would've been "just happy" we would've gotten 4 content release stages.
---
Hell, if we would've been "just happy" we never would have gotten Classic. We would have thought we wanted it but been told that we didn't. 
---
You think you are being the adult here but letting Blizzard drive this car has cost millions of wow players over the years. Let people give Blizzard the feedback they need to not screw up Classic. Even if you can't make a full page essay on how new AV sucks and how you would like Old AV. Then just say what ever you want. Letting blizzard drive is irresponsible.
---
Nope, just my cutting edge iPhone 6.
---
&gt; even if it means sacrificing a few niche things that people are getting upset about
---
So basically you're putting your own gratification above everyone else's. Just because you don't care about some things doesn't mean other people don't. Maybe you're willing to sacrifice something that's the most important aspect of vanilla to someone else. 
---
&gt; Lets take the official AV post for example. 99% of y'all are just going in AV to get exalted for whatever piece of gear you want, and will probably not look back. 
---
Thats exactly the point. If you want to go in to old AV for easy epics youre in for a big surprise. Nost babies (im looking at you more than anyone) take AV gear for granted and assume its just preraid gear. It isnt. Old AV rep was balanced, you go in, grind a bit of rep, you leave, it was only slightly easier to get than WSG and AB because AV rep wasnt really contingent on winning any games. You dont grind for 10 hours and get easy epics, if you want that, go play BfA.
---
&gt; but god damn most of you have never had to complete with 1000 people in  one zone trying to kill shit. You know how long it took me to get level 6  on xxxxxx in Teldrasil (arguably one of the lower pop starting  zones)? 
---
Ah yes, more pserver experience to bring to the table. Yes, I have tried to compete with 1000 people in 1 zone, in retail, on 3 different new servers. It took about 40 minutes to get to level 6, faster than it usually takes, as it usually took me about an hour. The increased spawn rates implemented by Blizzard back in Vanilla was far faster than any pserver ive ever seen.
---
&gt;You think you do, but you don't
---
Yeah, lets just take Blizzard news as it comes and not disagree with it.
---
Yeah I think I'd be fine to heal in raids or whenever asked. And I know there are occasions to swap gear for a certain boss and help off-tank. I mostly just want to be useful, while also being somewhat rare.
---
Thanks for reminding me that heroic dungeons in TBC were actually hard.  Shattered Halls, my god.  If your group wasn't on their game, it would bend you over.
---
It doesn't really sound like you read my post. Druids need shadowmeld to eat/drink while remaining stealthed. You can't eat/drink in cat form in vanilla. And NEs have improved stealth level which allows them to win stealth duels vs rogues. The dodge is negligible, hence why I didn't mention it.
---
well guess that ends the whole "i'm too mature for pvp servers" snobbery
---
I'd be ok with it if they deleted PvE realms.  And maybe delete all the characters on those realms while they're at it.  But merging them with PvP realms is unforgivable.
---
thats true. alto what i would do is maybe few first stv quests and if its totally contested then go desolace actually. along with quests i grinded scorpions and lizards there for Large venom sacs and large fans for nice money.. also trash sells 3g around everytime so i was there from 30 to like 37
---
Just like what happened to Mario Party.
---
Meanwhile in Tirisfal Glades it's just:
---
&gt;Oh my god these murderous farmers are trying to kill me!  I just want some pumpkins... to poison... and feed to a captured human ok yeah I get it.
---
Give us rp-pvp, PLEASE Blizzard!
---
You realize that the only reason Classic WoW is happening is because of sustained player complaints and insistence on the value/appeal of a high quality vanilla recreation right?
---
We really deserve one.... I cannot believe that they aren't considering it
---
Fucking Epic.
---
As of right now I'm very hyped for the halo release, and cannot wait for Classic WoW.  It feels like 2004 all over again.
---
Every single game I've played with any bid system always results in horse shit. It's terrible and I could not more strongly urge people not to use bid "pay what you feel" systems. Fuck them to death.
---
&gt;Now my question is that, why is everyone saying Night Elves are bad rogues?
---
Male NEs have the most garbage, god awful stealth animation in the history of video games.
---
Female NEs can get multiple flip jumps in a row. This is the superior race.
---
Only to see dozens of other people already wielding it when you hit 60. I like the idea of RP but there's some stuff that just breaks my immersion in the way the game works.
---
i always grind mobs. doesent matter if its moving from place a to place b or planning what to do next. just kill everything that gives xp (and money on side) 
---
Whoever decided wow players didn't want 40-man raid content was a fucking twat.
---
Just knowing this was happening in the world added so much prestige to the game.
---
Troll does slightly more dps, but Undead racial is also nice because in vanilla every other boss has a fear mechanic that can get you killed and you can’t do dps when you’re dead. 
---
It's well known that a lot of RP players frequent discussion forums.  I think this particular set of outrage is indeed the community being upset with that particular decision.
---
It is always hard to tell though.
---
Depends what you plan to do with your brother. Are you gonna be mainly playing with him? Do you guys want to do pvp/pve? etc. I personally am gonna be playing rogue and would love having a rogue buddy over anything else. I had a really good rogue friend in vanilla and we had so much fun together being sneaky bastards! 
---
Warlocks. Infernals blocking a key quest mob in low level zones.
---
Honestly, I hate people who have this notion that blizzard is some sort of buddy that deserves to be praised. These guys are making a product and we as consumers want to spend money on it and they want feedback on what we believe in. Yes it's not everyone and some people can't articulate but most people especially with the AV changes were more so disappointed and asking blizzard to reconsider and when blizzard listened they got so much praise. I feel like OP is being a bit hyperbolic here. 
---
yeah they’re definitely not practical. i was more thinking for those rare times when you’re temporarily playing with one hand for some reason. 
---
Druids. Exact same spec to level, do solo quests, and heal in raids.
---
Its so cool how when shammies get into Naxx they can start using plate. Just another cool part of the flavor that makes Classic special.
---
You mean you actually bring clothes to goldshire?  I figured it was a nudist colony by now.
---
Huuhaaa! I got you green skin! Now prepare to die!
---
Disclaimer: This was heavy sarcasm and I don't give a shit which version of anything we get. But it's pretty funny that someone out there IS salty, yes.
---
Its not haha but ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
---
My friend and I (both hunters) would gank that area relentlessly for hours everyday to the point that people were trying to report us and get us banned, post on the forums about us, etc.
---
Duskwood can be scary for other reasons. WE WILL RETURN.
---
Well the dynamic of an RP-PvP server differs quite a bit because the focus shifts away from regular RP and more towards PVP RP.
---
The stuff you do on a regular RP server kind of falls by the wayside in favor of coordinated PvP events. If we're realistic RP-PvP isn't so much raw RP as it is a server where you make crossfaction PvP appointments in cool settings/locations.
---
I  think a lot of people get offput by being "stuck" as Protection for  levving so they don't have to respec for dungeons, as they're the only  real tanks in Vanilla.
---
I ran with a  group on a fresh private server when it launched, and our warrior was 2h  fury and tanked fury spec. One HS and a TClap or Demo Shout was plenty  of aggro, and they got so much rage from taking damage they just spammed  HS. We ran up to SM like this, after about lev 45 you start getting  trucked if you don't have good gear and going Prot is much better.
---
 
---
As  someone who grinded hardcore on a pserver when it launched, you can very  easily do MC, Ony, and BWL in all "bis" blues. It can take a LOT of  grinding, but you can run the 60 dungeons and get BIS gear. Our first  clear of MC took about 3hrs total with everyone in blues and not even  BIS blues. BWL can be tricky as your HP would be pretty low, and you'd  lack resistances, but it is very possible.
---
Completely random blues? Prob won't get invites. The best for your class pre-raid? Not a problem at all.
---
I love duskwood
---
I guess I could log in and look at old stuff like Scepter of the Shifting Sands in my bank.  Not sure it's worth a huge download though.
---
Hopefully the community can get together and pick one, otherwise I'm going on a pvp server and praying. 
---
Just a pvp server until the rp-pvp servers roll around 
---
Maybe start a petition, on https://www.change.org or something, i mean 2k+ people and it should be enough to show them there is an interest and enough people for RP-PVP right ?
---
Or you can make a positive post yourself instead of complaining about the complainers
---
Upvote for maturity...the entitlement in this sub can get downright shameful
---
&gt; How about you create a positive post for a change
---
I find your lack of self-awareness disturbing
---
&gt; leave the #nochanges virgins alone? These are people with literally no life
---
What the actual fuck are you talking about
---
I think the overlooked news from the latest RP update video is how some small regions wont get ANY RP servers whatsoever let alone RP-PVP. Really sucks for them. 
---
Make it 5 druids. You got your bear tank, resto healer, boomkin dps, cat dps and... umm.. melee moonkin?
---
jebaited
---
It's pretty much like hunter/hunter. You're already lvling fast on your own and the other guy doesn't give you any buffs since you got the same ones already.
---
I'm sure most people won't be happy having to reroll after X months of playing.
---
Troll PVE UD PVP, but at the end of the day. Go with what is aesthetically more pleasing for you. Vanilla is long and grindy pick what you like more instead of min-max and feel like you dont like what picked.
---
Why would I do that when I can just keep complaining?
---
Rofl finally someone able to give me a decent chuckle. Thanks 
---
In groups your kill speed goes up a lot so travel speed becomes a bigger part of the levelling time. So just because of this yes 2x druid is pretty good. Probably not as good as 2x hunter or hunter/druid though with hunter doing a fair bit more dps than a druid. I don't think healer/warrior or priest/lock is ever thought of as being super fast, just fun dotting everything or rounding stuff up and cleaving down with a warrior.
---
Play the game regardless. 
---
/thread
---
Yeah I really wanted to roll a few toons on a rp-pvp server.
---
Scream real loud
---
Then scream even louder
---
Judgement is badass but that's about it. I think I'd take the shamans overall aesthetic over pally T2.
---
Also, I mained shaman in vanilla. Come at me.
---
Found the alliance player
---
why are those guys special? looks like a random wow guild 
---
This is dumb. It'll most likely only add to the release date given how small their Classic staff is. This problem can be addressed post-launch without much inconvenience. 
---
Nah, dawg, wasting 25% of your MP to turn in to a bear and charge the enemy is way more efficient :V
---
*A way more efficient way to oom* /s
---
Thank you! 
---
Back in Vanilla whenever a new server released, they had free character migration to this server. Not sure if it only was from a selected bunch of servers or from all servers though. 
---
EJ was literally on my server.... I played on mal'ganis. This dude thinks everyone knew perfect itemization, I was in one of the top 3-5 guilds on the server for most of vanilla and I knew dick about itemization compared to what's commonly known now.
---
That's not the point. PvP and RP-PvP are very different environments. 
---
I care very little for smallscale RP, I care about in character wars, guild fueds, and the storylines players can weave with each other. Guild wars and drama happen on regular PvP servers, but it's a lot more immersive with a bit of RP undertones to it. 
---
At the end of the day, I'll role on a PvP server, but I seriously doubt I'll participate in RP without a dedicated server. It's too niche and I care too much about competitive play. If that fun fantasy RP environment isn't integrated into my style of play, I doubt I'll particiapte in it, sadly. 
---
Classic RP-PvP servers were something I've been hyped on for a long time because of the unique experience it offers. You can be hardcore, but the gameplay is very open to RP even during tense moments. It's just a way to nerd the fuck out and have a good time tryharding at the same time. I dont think the experience will be the same on a pvp server. 
---
Entangling Roots is a balance spell. I don't see why you couldn't cast it in Moonkin form.
---
I played on mal'ganis, EJ was on my fucking server. No one talked about going to their forums, or had BiS lists. People had a general idea of what was and wasn't good. What defense cap was, what hit rating you should try to get to. But, if you think peopl had anywhere near the level of data they do now you're in a dream world. Most people were wearing tier, even the garbage pieces. The shiny purple shit that dropped in raids was getting used even if it was bad. Vendorstrike was about the only exception.
---
I was in the RP community from day 1. Yes the RP PvP servers weren't available on release, but I'm very sure even back than those servers were heavily requested by the community. 
---
That is the very reason that they existed later on.
---
Blizz didn't randomly create them. 
---
I'm baffled that they assume they are niche. 
---
At least open one for every major region like NA and EU. I'm very sure they are going to be high pop servers.
---
The amount of toxicity in this sub is unreal. I guess this is what happens when you have a bunch of virgins cramped together in a tight space with nothing to do or talk about. All this negativity needs to stop!
---
Warstomp &gt; Shadowmeld drinking, imo. I guess having been on the receiving end of many Warstomps. Maybe the grass just looks greener?
---
I was never sure how much "improved" the racial was for stealth. Is it similar to Feral Instinct talent?
---
Afaik it’s basically equal to 1 level of feral instinct or rogue’s imp stealth talent. Pair it with feral instinct itself and cats eye goggles and you’ll basically never get pulled out by rogues
---
Yes, EJ was a guild formed by people off a forum. I believe the forum was somethingawful? They were literally on my server (mal'ganis), just because they existed doesn't mean people knew they were the go to source for theory crafting and itemization. I remember going to other sources and they were literally the biggest guild on my server.... Far from common knowledge.
---
T4 was 'Justicar' set, I believe. If that's what you're referring to, I concur it was actually pretty sweet when you had the full set.
---
Yessss. People don't seem to realize that even though you could find the information somewhere, doesn't mean it was common at all. Also, people really didn't share it as openly. 
---
I played horde, orcs and axes was about the only real weapon skill racial people had. But, if you're going to play a melee class on alliance human is basically the end all be all.
---
Tier 2 Warlock is perfect.
---
I hear ya, I don't RP at all - and even I considered rerolling on one of the RPvP servers (Emerald Dream I think?) because I heard nothing but amazing stuff about the constant WPvP that was happening.
---
You right. But the lack of heals is too much for not enough pay off in pvp. You could be a group crit buff for funziez tho, and I'm sure we'll see some
---
Exactly correct. I'm sure there were some sources that had great information. But there was also a ton of bad information. The people who had truly dissected the game weren't shouting it from the hilltop back then.
---
damn that's no rp-pvp? damn 
---
Username checks out 
---
1-12 will take 4 hours alone on opening day.
---
Because classic is an unprecedented move with a ton of implications, can you really blame people for speculating? I would blow Ion to completion if it meant we'd get an official and progressive wrath server without dungeon/raid finder.
---
&gt;Person mentions Eve Online
---
"LOL Thats just spreadsheets in space who would want to play something like that?
---
&gt;Proceeds to spreadsheet exact mobs of what level to kill and how many and where and how long it will take involving calculations.
---
Very f few 1v1s will require you to heal yourself.
---
Since Moonkin inflates your armour value, and you can hibernate a hunter's pet. Melee will just keep proccing Nature's grasp.
---
Wait, are they not? 
---
RP PVP is specifically what I am looking for.
---
Nope, Christmas event snowballs also did at one point. I had a bankchar only for snowballs, i am dead certain about this.
---
What is the difference between Rp and RP-pvp? can't you still kill eachother on RP servers? 
---
I don’t get the hype for them right now, hardly anyone actually roleplayed and it was almost no different than a regular PVP server. There was ganking, trash talking, people with offensive names just like everywhere else 
---
The Hard-packed snowballs were only obtainable during Christmas event.
---
Thanks for the lead, I've been looking for good laptops for Classic
---
8GB is enough to run 95% of games. Very rare in my experience that you'll *need* 16GB.
---
Did you read the 2nd paragraph?
---
Thanks again! Also, the only I time I had fun as ret was when I was lvl 20, got SoC and Smite's Mighty Hammer. Insta-kill when proc'd. Besides that, auto-attack x 9999 lol.
---
The Ion dude always looks to me like a scumbag. Like he is trying to cheat every single second of his life.
---
Sorry man, but you are wrong. You got snowballs from a Santa vendor something and they where just called snowball.
---
I think the hardpacked snowballs are from AV and those are the one with a knockback, people used to knock players of bringes wtih. Did these expire also?
---
Regular snowballs had a knockdown/interrupt.
---
Ion:  
---
&gt; we'd be open to adding it.   
---
That's pretty encouraging. Sounds like they would be willing to add RP-PvP servers.
---
I finished LBRS with 2 of my friends all of us were hunters. a lot of traps and kiting, but was fun (no one needed anything we were t2).
---
You have hard proof? Because you are saying the same thing with the same kind of "I know everything" attitude as the people who said warlock demons didnt instantly disappear as soon as you began to cast a new summon.
---
No need to get so worked up when someone calls out your lie.
---
&gt;I remember that RP-PVP wasn't added until quite sometime after Classic's launch.
---
&gt;The Emerald Dream server (US) is a Role-play – Player vs. Player (RPPvP) Central time zone realm. It opened in September of 2005 as one of three pioneering servers to combine role-play with a PvP rule set.
---
noob
---
I think what the poster meant in regards to rp-pvp is that it is just a simple server setting, it doesn't actually require any hard changes or make the game different etc, except for have PvP always on in contested and hostile areas.
---
The same as pve and pvp, you need to flag yourself for pvp on rp servers
---
You can tell this is an official screenshot for the simple fact that item links weren't added in the game yet; I have a screenshot exactly like this.
---
&gt; So basically you're putting your own gratification above everyone else's.
---
No, OP is saying "be grateful you're getting Vanilla, enjoy what you're getting, don't bitch about it not being the shade of taste you prefer, it's still Vanilla in the end."  
---
It's a very different meaning from what you are trying to make it into, and it's mainly about maturity.  
---
"Accept what you're being given, instead of complaining about what you're not."
---
On PvP realms, PvP is always turn on in hostile and contested areas. As it should be.
---
If you as horde see an alliance in orgrimmar, it doesn't make any sense that you shouldn't be able to kill them, out of an rp standpoint.
---
&gt;by the time I got bored of the Paladin
---
Sooo level 12 then?
---
I'm wondering if I should set some sort of reminder, for this, and then ask for proof...
---
Good plan. Now you can bulk up 40 pounds of fat while no-lifing the game come summer!
---
&gt;The cash shop has routinely taken resources away from main development, the most notable example of which is removing Karabor and Bladespire as the main faction cities of WoD
---
Yeah, uh......... Excuse you? LMAO
---
The reason all the content from Warlords was cut was because of arbitrary time restrictions Blizzard put on themselves.
---
Most classes in Warlords were actually in a really great state, Legion doubly so. Mists was also an awesome highlight of class design. Pre-Cata was better in a lot of regards but there have been awesome moments. 
---
That on the RP server you cannot ~~get ganked by people overleveling you~~ **go around and gank lowbies and role-play your power fantasy.**
---
Way ahead of you bud :D
---
Yea, I do desolace in 2 waves.  first low 30's then again in mid/upper 30's.  There's also thousand needles around the early/mid 30's iirc.
---
Yeah that's cool and all but satan
---
Damn bro is cherry Sprite Zero any good?
---
Devourikg plague is ass in anything but 1v1, it takes a zillion mana and will be removed instantly
---
Hahah cheers
---
Awesome!
---
Honestly, the thread specifically dedicated to this, the one with the poll results, shows that only 10% of the people voting want RP servers, with just 2.2% of voters wanting RP-PvE.  
---
If Blizzard were to see the results of that poll, what do you think should be their reaction?  
---
My polite guess is "just one tenth, does not justify those servers."
---
Ironic
---
Anyone have a template for this meme? 
---
I think it’s because they are not sure there will be enough players to sustain RP PvP Realms in all regions.
---
In vanilla, shadowmelt could only be used outside of combat. It would disappear again after any damage (like a dot tick), it upon moving.
---
I play fury and do rather well in BGs, but I really do rely on procing my talent where after a charge my next bloodthirst heals for 250% more, this has saved me so many times. But with a pocket healer I can face roll other players fairly easily, we also have decent utility with thunder strike, our fear, movement slow and heroic leap. 
---
Long had we waited.
---
Just a shame he does them digitally i would pay a lot of Australian Dollarydoos for one of those. Still looks insane, i have one as my background but having one on canvas on my wall would be tip top.
---
Coolest fucking name, too. 
---
But no, I think Ten Storms is the coolest set in the game, personally. 
---
Druid vs. Druid, Paladin vs. Paladin or Druid vs. Paladin usually leads to some of the most infuriating stalemates.
---
It takes so long to kill each other that after the first round of potions go off, the cooldown comes back up before you have the chance to kill him and then he's not that far off his next Innervate, and before you know it you've both spent 20g on consumables and are getting bored of each other's faces.
---
I hate dkp, it takes forever, or some people are afk and pissed off they didn't bet.
---
Worst thing is when two guys have 1k dkp and try to outbid each other with 5 points. 
---
This time around I try to get into an LC raid. 
---
I can just enjoy raiding and eventually get some loot assigned to me. 
---
I would like that a lot. 
---
:( Mope. And play on a PvP server and name myself Nosehairs instead Urok the Orc Battlemaster.
---
I’m so sick of this argument. 
---
Vanilla - everybody was horrible and didn’t know anything
---
Retail - everybody is a genius and a wow god
---
It’s wrong. 
---
Due to how many people roll UD to play mage and priests on voldemort servers I feel obligated to suggest playing as a Troll.
---
Private servers are rarified air compared to what classic will be
---
I don't think you understand how the ability works. Sure if you activate it, you can't move. But if you use regular rouge stealth instead, you get a passive bonus to your stealthing ability because you have shadowmeld.
---
"Ambercombie."
---
I almost quit leveling once I reached level ~20 because of Duskwood. Standing at the bridge between Westfall and that god forsaken place, I just thought "nope nope nope", and went to do every quest I could in Redridge and Wetlands. Eventually I just had to go to Duskwood and get it over with.
---
I did it before and it was AMAZING. I would do it a hundred times again honestly. It’s so fun.
---
It’s blocked in the US
---
No dishonorable kills
---
Honor system online before battlegrounds
---
Depends on your guild. If you're in a decent loot council guild your mt is probably gonna get the first of anything good that drops and some of the next few drops are going to the first/second offtank. 
---
No loot council or low on the totem pole? Good luck.
---
Inner Focus is mandatory as Undead.
---
Release date. That's all i care about.
---
Moonwalking "bug"
---
Ganking horde on the road out of the Barrens into ashenvale... I can still hear the tauren death-moos.
---
Wow, playing since launch and didn't know that, although only played a month on private servers, so if I didn't learn then, wouldn't learn now. 
---
He has the best voice. It's up there with Yogg-Saron and Malygos
---
Another thing is Mind Blast is a 1.5s cast so it doesn't speed up future casts because you're throttled by the global cooldown.  
---
It goes from a 1.5s cast down to a 1.3s cast at best. Then you have to stand around and wait 0.2 seconds before your next spell cast.
---
Anti- queue-dodging measures
---
Nobody is as upset as you. Go login to retail and look at what they did to the spell oil and talents and tell me your happy.
---
We piss and moan because the fucks who want the game to be everything it was not piss and moan and the Devs listen to whoever is loudest. 
---
It took a decade for them to even consider our dedication to the way things used to be. 
---
I get that life changes but video games don't have to.
---
Original (high) lava damage
---
Gotta love that iconic shoulder pads + orc combo 
---
I don't think they need an open beta to 'gauge the interest' of the community when a simple survey could do the trick. 
---
It was shorthand for "Very few who are still around and remember it properly.". Vanilla had fantastic userbase growth and most people would've only ever experienced the 1.11 version which was the last half year of vanilla. Keep in mind you'd also have to be 51+ and most were very slow levelers, in fact an overwhelming majority aould not have reached that.
---
Confirmation of Oceanic servers.
---
I generally agree. I think people go down the mopey 5 year route far too quickly and rather than expressing their opinion constructively, half of their post is them whining about how they won’t touch Classic now that there might not be RP PvP or not their preferred AV.
---
First off, for RP PvP, you can choose RP and you can choose PvP. I know it may not be perfect but I’m sure one of those is more important to you, so just go with that, and maybe they will actually have RP PvP anyway. For AV, this is a tiny proportion of the game, and if it’s game breaking enough for you then you must’ve loved AV to not want to play. In fact for both of these I’m calling your bluff. I don’t believe there is a single person out there that wouldn’t play Classic as a direct result of one of these announcements. And hey, maybe it’s time to wake up and realise there are millions of players, not just one, so to expect everything to fall neatly on your lap exactly how you wanted it is unrealistic. 
---
That's stupid because if we didn't bitch we never would have WoW classic at all. 
---
The way Retail got to be the way it is now is that people bitched. Loudly repetitively. Endlessly. 
---
If we don't bitch then some idiots will come to classic bitching that Subtlety rogues can use Garrote and need to have it taken away or some other stupid shit.
---
Ya'll motherfuckers need darkshore, there're like 5 quests you complete by just finding a corresponding carcass along the beach. You can get from 11-18 there with zero issue.
---
Do you like ads?
---
I’ve commented below but basically I agree with you that you should voice your opinion. My issue is that too many people voice their opinion in such a poor tone that you can’t have any Dialoge with them. Every opinion is valid. 
---
I usually can't help but hit 12, but I also kill mobs as I walk when I level anywhere.
---
I played on Emerald Dream from about 2005-2012. It was my first server as well. There was a fair bit of RP, especially in the earlier days. Not as much as some other servers (I have alts on Wyrmrest Accord), but I could for sure find RP events happening without trying.
---
Supporting blizzard means bitching. Blizzard listens to whoever bitches the loudest. That's what they've done since launch. 
---
The hope is that retail can bitch for what retail wants and we can bitch for what we want.
---
If we don't bitch for what we want Blizzard can't know. 
---
&gt;	No need to get so worked up when someone calls out your lie.
---
I am done here.
---
I suppose they had several reasons to remove it. Griefing being one of them aswell I guess.
---
This is not true for the majority of the servers. Most new servers provided a fresh start for everybody.
---
There probably were some handful servers that were opened to get people to transfer from the full servers to. And it was probably only selected servers you could transfer from.
---
In my experience there is usually a central place where RPers show up to strictly rp such as goldshire.
---
Most of the hardcore rp is organized inside guilds to keep a similar standard and everyone can kind of prepare for the event with time and location etc.
---
My favorite thing about them is the level of world PvP.  People seem to have each others back more and will go out of their way to deal with gankers and help out their fellow faction.
---
stop complaining about the people complaining about complainers....
---
I agree, there seems to be a very healthy discussion going on, they may not please everyone in the end but we need people posting complaints and even better solutions.          
---
             
---
We dont need ignorant silence even if it does piss off Hee-Haw.
---
1. Stop shilling for activision and their money-money-money policies. That is what sharding is all about. Money. 
---
2. If we dont voice our concerns, then we may get a half-assed-botched classic-retail-franken-hybrid.
---
3. The classic project team has themselves explicitly stated that they want feedback on what we like and what we dont like.
---
In Classic RpPvP servers will be a lot more popular than rp servers. Most people want to play open world pvp and not be restricted in who they attack. It's a part of Vanilla. Most players who want to rp also want to open world pvp. By not releasing RpPvP servers at launch there will be a big group who will be heavily disappointed because they can't play on that type of server.
---
Rp is clearly the most niche type of server.
---
There are quests in the Horde war campaign in Lakeshire, right?
---
Sneaky watermark promoting the stream
---
You'd have to be insane to skip Impale in the Arms tree as DPS.
---
Speaking of NE male animations, they look like a ribbon dancer when they swing a 2h.
---
this
---
God, why does every other line of your post contain an insult. You can do better than that.
---
So based on this something like 
---
1 Rp server
---
3 RpPvP servers
---
8 PvE servers
---
29 PvP servers
---
It is rather simple.
---
At the moment they have their 8.15 promotion. With their current patch design it will be staggered to get people to sub for 2 months
---
Then we have 1 month till summer would officially start - yet that doesn't mean we can expect a release date around that time.  
---
It'll be more up to whether or not a 8.2 PTR rolls out after those 2 8.1.5 months. If there is a 8.2 PTR you can simply assume with a 99.9% chance that the classic servers will launch at the last month of summer as a major patch usually gets stretched out to get people to sub for potentially 3 months.  
---
It’s not right to call someone a baby for expressing their opinion, but honestly they wouldn’t play PvP or RP if Blizzard don’t go back on their decision?
---
Hahah
---
Blows my mind tha RpPvP servers are considered niche by Blizzard but Rp not.
---
:))
---
 You don't even need to periodically damage a mob to keep it leashed. All you need to do is refresh a debuff within a set time interval.
---
I kited Gamon from Orgrimmar to the gates of Ahn'Qiraj on my Warlock by refreshing Curse of Weakness rank 1. I no longer have the screenshot, but it was uploaded on Gamon's WoWhead page for years until Blizzard changed him and all the old screenshots became obsolete.
---
I don’t take it as “shut up” and more “make your point, don’t insult people and be grateful”
---
&gt;What would "there is interest" be in this scenario? 
---
Note that I said nothing about interest. I said that waiting to see if there were sufficient numbers of players would be a reasonable position. Blizzard has no idea how many people will play Classic, and neither do you. There might only be enough people to fill 2 PvE, 2 PvP and a single RP server. Blizzard is playing things cautious, which is entirely reasonable given that they have no idea how popular re-releasing a game from 2004 is going to be. 
---
If Classic proves to be successful, as we all hope it will be, then no doubt Blizzard will open more servers, and look into some of them being RP-PvP. 
---
True enough.
---
Which people won't do in an RP setting unless they want PvP. So solution give us both an RP and RPPvP or merge them if there isn't enough. The whole point of the game is to crush the other side ultimately or there wouldn't be two factions 
---
"lets make it the 17th". Why? Because fuck everyone that's why
---
&gt; PvP content shouldn't be designed for people who don't enjoy PvP.
---
I dont know if you actually played all the AV versions in vanilla, i did. It was fun for a while. Even epic at times. Getting the spawn boss up and follow it.  Then it got REALLY annoying. Thats why the changes were made.
---
Anybody can do this but when I see Mages AoE grinding all of the mobs that other people for quests I break their frost nova to mess with them.  
---
Leave some for the rest of us buddy.
---
BFA launched crash free IIRC, they are using modern systems so as wild as it may seem I wouldn’t be surprised if we didn’t crash at all.. laggy and overcrowed for sure though, just gotta break ahead of the pack for free zones, no contest 
---
I have planned everything out already. 
---
My race and class
---
the type of server I'm going to play on (RpPvP)
---
found a guild who also wants to play on a RpPvP server.
---
And now Blizzard suddenly announces that there won't be any RpPvP servers on launch. Really Blizz? All polls show, that RpPvP is clearly more popular than Rp and and some polls even show that RpPvP is more popular than PvE. People clearly want that PvP aspect and taking that away from Rpers is a horrible decision. Just label one server per region RpPvP. It's not like it's any work. You just have to put Rp in front of some PvP server. Done.
---
I'm not going to change my plans. I have been looking forward to this since Blizzcon 2017. If there won't be any RpPvP servers Blizz will not be getting my money.
---
I can't find his channel. Have you link mb?

Why should I be happy that out of the 4 maim versions of AV they picked the one I was expected the least? 
---
As you say yourself. You go there for the rewards, not the actual bg. So of course you want the dumb uninteresting version, so you can spend as little time as necessary on the bg and NEVER come back. But that's just plain SELFISH.
---
You obviously DON'T want to play this bg but yet your are telling people that actually enjoyed it to stop letting blizz know how we feel about that. 
---
After seeing posts like this one, sometimes, I just wish blizz would remove pvp rewards all together so we won't see boring people like you in bg. 
---
Oh and if blizz didn't want want feedback than why would they comunate news in the forum? Why would they say that they listen to the community.
---
Last, how ironic how whining and rude your post is, telling the RP community in a whole to f* off. Using the f* word 5 times and the b* word on several occasion. 
---
No knife ears allowed!
---
How about when you were just killing ghouls, minding your own business, and all of a sudden you get jumped by a epic skeleton in golden armor, that just proceeds to utterly murder you? Gotta love Duskwood!
---
If blowing all cd's, maybe. But a decent mage and hunter can and will kill a rogue even if they get the opener, assuming they engage a full hp target.  
---
  
---
Rogues are severely overestimated because they mostly engage when you're low hp, fighting other mobs/players. In a fair fight (duel), rogues aren't actually that amazing.
---
Don't discount the usefulness of fear breakers in PvE. The length of the encounter, the frequency of fear effects and the cooldown of the two racials determines the usefulness of being one race over the other.
---
If you gain 10% cast speed from Berserking that adds up to 1 additional spell cast from Berserking. If an Undead gains one or more casts from immunity to fear then you have your answer. It's situational.
---
Troll wins in engagements without a fear mechanic. Undead might win when fear is part of the fight.
---
The first time you randomly hear one of his quotes so is cool. Everyone started freaking out on vent
---

---
Big nice 
---
haha ZING! I actually managed to stay with it until 35.
---
As i recall it only knocked down partymembers.
---
Everything he says is "sit down and shut up"
---
a carrion with screech works wonders for that. But with that said it is a much slower process overall if you have to rely on pet tanking (regardless whether we talk about warlocks or hunters)
---
Dont forget the Worgens in stealth who only appear once you are running with 20% hp
---
You will have much more fun doing that in places like BRM. Kill everyone going into BRD, UBRS, MC.
---
Thats what real PVP looks like. 
---
I don't see why it would hurt you though should they open up a RP-PVP server later on. Because either they will open transfers to the realm and you won't loose any character progress. Or everyone needs to roll from lvl 1 and no one will have a advantage. 
---
I don't think they've said anything about it. Without dynamic respawns a lot of vanilla quests can only handle 2 - 3 people doing them, so people would have to basically ignore questing and just grind mobs for most levels.
---
You're right, and I apologise.  
---
I will try to include an insult in every line of my post from here on out.
---
There's always going to be idiots who can't form constructive arguments and will appeal to emotion instead, that doesn't mean everyone should shut up. Ironically you are one of them.
---
The only fear I have about that is that the players will design the game, not the developers. It's essentially what led to retail being in the state it is. A few years down the line Classic might be unrecognizable if the developers continue to let players run the show.
---
It was super immersive. And stitches patrolling around the road made me scared, was always watching my surrounding after the first time i got killed by him.
---
Then i saw a house in the graveyard, got curious and decided to see what was inside, purple thick frog meant you couldn't see far, saw high level undead but still wanted to go in to see what was inside only to be one shot by the elite there.
---
You can yourself enable PVP for every situation in normal RP, cant UNDO it on RP-PVP. RP servers arent in THAT much demand, so makes sense to just pick one type.
---
I for one wouldnt have PVE servers at all. RP or not. Taking WAR out of WAR OF WARCRAFT.
---
You forget that you could just, dunno. SELECT a PVP server and RP there, nobody is saying you cannot do that.
---
Go look at the RP-PVP thread I made. The vast majority of comments in there are not insulting anyone, just proclaiming their disappointment.
---
I agree with OP that it's not helpful to whine or be rude, but in many cases, that's not what is happening.
---
They have said they will not touch the data of the game. The data dictates the re-spawn timer values, so that would mean they are not going to change that.
---
Perhaps, or atleast members of the same faction. If it is the latter, then there is still potential for griefing.
---
It would be great if some YT content creators could do videos about Blizz not adding RpPvP servers. This would really help a lot.
---
&gt; You know how long it took me to get level 6 on Nostralius in Teldrasil (arguably one of the lower pop starting zones)? 6 FUCKING HOURS and my group was one of the first to reach 6. THIS IS NOT FUN. And if you have done it, you would know it's not. Oh just add dynamic respawns in to compensate. WRONG. Now all you Nost Babies have done is made a nonblizzlike change which is what youre bitching about in the first place.
---
A major difference though is that nost and other private servers had absurd realm caps. Hopefully they won't make changes like that to Classic and give us authentic realm caps which would mean that instead of 15k players there would be 2.5k which would mean that those 6 levels would only take one hour instead of six, even without sharding.
---
How do you know when he use it if you can't see him ?
---
Short answer, its a server where guys that suck eachothers dicks in Goldshire inn. But on a PVP server.
---
/jk
---
All the filthy role players coming out of the woodwork now, wassup guys :p
---
Big if true 
---
Shamans do the same, it has something to do with nature I think.
---
And I'm telling you that your question is moot because it's obviously not coming. You might as well ask if we're getting LFR. Same answer.
---
You can enable yourself, but others will be disabled. It's about having the possibility to participate in open world pvp.
---
I agree, not having PvE servers makes sense, but there are some people who just don't care about PvP and play the game just for endgame PvE. Those people will be playing on a PvE server.
---
The problem with regular PvP servers, is that it will be extremely difficult to find people who actually want to rp. That's why RpPvP servers exist.
---
The thing is, that 8% is from the most HC 0.1% of population thats going to play. If there were 10000 ppl answering, thats 800 ppl. Cant even fill 1 server faction with that.

---
Way ahead of you OP. Started in early February. Don't feel like dying to a heart attack after only having eaten hot pockets, mini pizzas and drunk nothing but pop for 8 days during the level grind :p
---
OP complaining about complainers for complaining about other complainers.
---
Kek
---
I don't disagree with either part, though I'd rather have constructive criticism than "MUH! BLIZZARD BAD" like some of the most vocal people do.  
---
I agree with OP when they mention the **way** people complain, but I agree with the complaining people about **what** they complain about.  
---
My personal stance, on the other hand, is the hope that Classic will pave the way to more legacy servers.
---
Need to factor in how big servers they are going to make. How many ppl will even choose RP servers, will there be multiple RP servers per region or not.
---
If they will have multiple servers, then you could argue that making one a PVP one makes sense. 
---
Just play on a PvP server instead, will be disappointing for sure but im not letting it ruin my fun.  If they open up one later and have transfers (free or paid) ill weigh my options then.

The only foray I ever made (that I can remember at least) into Duskwood in vanilla was my first and only alliance character--a human warlock. I quested into Westfall, started exploring. I crossed a bridge into some dark woods. It's right off Westfall, I said. It'll be fun, I said. It's a similar zone level I said. A wolf killed me.
---
I laughed all the way to character select, deleted, and rerolled horde to play with my friends. What little I'd seen of it was impressive, though.
---
Agreed. This sub isn't running off of trolls or negativity. There's posts everyday here about nostalgia, classic photos, friends and other memories. Memes work great here too.
---
We're definitely not letting Blizzard off for bad decisions though. Go look at retail sub and see the disaster that is Blizzard acting unilaterally. We're in a good spot here. 
---
The people who want RpPvP are much more numerous than people who simply want Rp. Not having RpPvP servers available at launch is just a nonsensical decision by Blizz. The demand for RpPvP servers is easily big enough.
---
The reason why players complain so much is simple. We had to in order for Blizzard to even recognize that we want Classic servers. It took years of players being upset and complaing on forums and demands at BlizzCon + a 800.000 accounts registered private server for them to finally give us what we want. Now they announce that a popular server type won't be there at launch. Of course people are upset. Classic should have been there years ago. We have been waiting 13+ years to finally play our favorite game again. Of course people are upset when Blizzard makes some weird decision. It's their fault.
---
Hunter can tame a low level beast and act like a normal mob with eye of the beast. Once a low level attacks he js pvp flagged and you can kill him.
---
Warlock can summon people on the edge of a mountain. If that person accepts he falls to his death.
---
Priest can MC.
---
Mage can polymorth mobs someone is fighting to heal the mob.
---
Paladin can Divine Intervention on the tank so he drops all aggro. Time it right and the party is dead.
---
Also Blessing of less treat generation could be usefull for tanks.
---
Shaman can give waterwalking when someone makes a high jump into the water. Waterwalking gives fall damage in that case.
---
Rogue can sap people at boats or zeppelins.
---
Warrior can't do anything.
---
Druid are just nice people...
---
Now imagine this reaction with them actually pulling through with the original beta design of pitch black nights and torch/candle/lantern crafting to provide light sources.
---
Then I have no problem with them people on your thread and I hope OP wouldn’t either.
---
That's not a downside.
---
Male troll is the ideal male body. This is what peak performance looks like.
---
I'm disappointed with 1.12 AV. I think earlier versions are more iconic. You telling me "well stop it" isn't going to make me any less dissatisfied with this specific thing.
---
Blizz has made it clear from some of the earliest interviews with J.A.B. that they will be taking community feedback into account. If people stop providing feedback, Blizz doesn't have as much of a barometer on what the players want and don't want. To that end I think it's personally reasonable for people to make their opinions known on any official announcements and to make suggestions on features that have not been announced yet.
---
*Woah!* It's your **7th Cakeday** Pull_The_Curtain! ^(hug)

WoW on a PvE server is boring, dull and just doesn't seem right. And I want to RP. Bam, RP-PvP server!

Issues? All they need to do is open a PvP realm and tag it RP-PvP. How's that an issue? And according to that 10k+ answered poll, 10% of the playerbase will play on RP realms. 1 out of 10 isn't 1%.
---
You can still attack npcs. Rock up to Southshore and start murdering the vendors and world pvp will happen. It just requires both parties to actively want it.
---
haha yeah for sure it was coz it was unexpected and the first time. Took us some time to actually kill the boss as he was way over tuned at release. Still one of the funniest moments in my vanilla experience :D
---
The people who want to play on Rp servers generally want to play on a RpPvP and not a RpPvE server. If you haven't noticed, the demand for PvP servers in general (both Rp and non Rp) is a lot higher than the demand for PvE servers in general. If there is one Rp server per region it definetely should be a RpPvP server and not RpPvE.
---
And why would they not just release one at start since RP-PvP is more popular than RP-PvE? The only reason they didn't release one at launch was because they didn't think people wanted it. That was a mistake. Now they know we want it, and still say they don't. Same mistake all over again.

They are the vocal minority for a reason.
---
+1
---
There should really be room for one RP-Pvp realm. The interest is obviously there. 
---
Which is the problem. Most players want to be able to attack players of the enemy faction without them having to flag for PvP first. Also one thing people want that only PvP servers can provide is that you always have to be careful when you are in a contested zone, there might always be someone from the opposite faction around the next corner who can attack you. This adds so much immersion and is a must for me and a lot of other players who also want Rp.
---
Blizzard is ASKING US FOR FEEDBACK. And they make POOR DECISIONS. Of Course people will be upset when they kind of ruin things that made Vanilla Epic.
---
This looks like it was taken in the 90's

If you don't like it. Don't read it. Thanks.

**DPS+ Healer Looking For "Medium / Hardcore" NA PvP Centric Guild**

Intended Faction: Either

Intended Playtimes: Pacific (PST) Ideally
---
Guild Priority: WPvP &gt; BGs = Raiding

*About me:*
---
Hi, I'm Mox. I'm a 30 year old hardcore PvP gamer, I enjoy min/maxing, experimenting with new tactics and pushing the envelope of what is considered possible to achieve a hard fought victory. I am the textbook definition of a "try hard". When Classic releases I expect it to be my #1 hobby and I will put a lot of time into it, however  I'm an adult with a real life, work, school, and a family - as such I am not able to be a no-lifer (No server first 60, no Rank 14 grind) and will not put the game ahead of RL obligations. I am tentatively planning to main a Rogue in classic, but am at least competent on all DPS and Tanking class / specs.
---
I also have a like minded pocket healer that is intending to join the same group as me. Experienced classic player, likely slightly less PvP skilled, equally try hard, and much more no life / committed. He is tentatively planning to play Priest if Horde, and Paladin if Allies.
---
*My gaming experience:*
---
I play mostly FPS games, first playing competitively in Team Fortress Classic in the ADL.
---
Vanilla was my first MMO, I raided classic as a Warlock, I cleared all relevant content starting in ZG thru AQ40, and dabbled in Naxx as a 2nd string raider (due to RL commitments interfering with raid times, not performance) with my guild getting up to Saphiron. 
---
I had to take all of BC off for a work.
---
I returned in WotLK playing melee (Namely Feral / DK) and stayed melee since - I cleared all relevant raid content and most of the optional 'Hard Mode' encounters, with the first legit Horde side 'S3D' on the server.
---
In Cataclysm I again played melee and cleared all relevant raid content in the hard / heroic modes and was able to get Horde / Server firsts of select bosses.
---
After Cata my interest in the game I would sub and unsub regularly and had large gaps in my play time. Because of this I did not raid and instead did competitive PvP where I reached 2300+ rating in Arena and 2000+ rating in Rated Battle Grounds.
---
Since 2012 I have been playing Planetside 2 (a large scale FPS) almost exclusively, and am a day 1 member of the games arguably most successful and noteworthy hardcore "outfit" (Guild).
---
*What I am looking for in a Guild:*
---
I am looking to join a group of highly skilled, mature people - who's main goal is to dominate the other faction but are still large enough to fill a raid and competent enough to clear it in a timely manner. R14 is out of the question for me, so I'm fully expecting to need to raid to be better equipped for PvP. I'm a try hard, no BS player; and would like to be surrounded with like minded team mates. I'm looking for a guild that understands that WoW is my #1 hobby, not my #1 priority, and that I may not be able to reliably make most raid / event times. I'm fine with being benched / 2nd string for a more reliable player, but when I am able to play with the group I want to know I'm playing with the best. In short - a guild with the highest of performance standards, but a more lax / understanding expectation of time investment.
---
*What can the guild expect of me:*
---
Because Classic will likely be my main hobby and only video game at launch I will be on regularly and invest many hours, however as mentioned before I do not expect to be the most reliable raider able to meet a set time / day schedule, and am OK with being 2nd string because of this. When I am online however, you can expect me to be try-harding, and giving 110% effort and concentration to the task at hand. Both my PvE and PvP performance should be among the best for my class / gear. When it comes to consumables / enchants - we will see, as a try hard I would like nothing better than to have the most expensive enchants and stacks and stacks of FAPs, Tubers, and Res pots farmed up before every encounter, but I cannot say with confidence that time will allow for that. What I can say is that I will be putting my legitimate best effort into the grind to be prepared, not because I'm afraid of having the raid leader yell at me, but because I am a motivated self-stater with an overwhelming desire to win. 
---
Feel free to contact me by responding to this post, or PMing me for any further information.
---
GLHF, Mox
---
I see what you are going for but one could argue that you are the one trying to be a special snowflake - “only a certain kind of person enjoys what I would enjoy..”
---
The thing is you level faster alone as opposed to dual as a hunter or druid or warlock past 20 
---
It will be so hard for me to decide between these two on launch day. Harder than I thought.  
---
I love the troll background, culture and style. I would like to test shadow guard with blackout procs. I prefer not being one of countless Undeads. But there is something about troll movement that permanently annoys me. They have this clumsy and very slow body animation and I dont know if I can settle for that.  
---
Undeads... are just okay for me lore wise. After all they were just written in the story of The frozen Throne because Blizzard needed a Plot devise to have playable Undeads for the Horde in WoW. :-P
---
I really like Tirisfal, I like UD body animation and they also have very nice racials.
---
Does anyone else have the same problem? Do you think you can get used to a character, when you intially dont like the animation?
---
Oh ok. My only experience is my current company. We just have to give double notice but they don't really care. So for 2 days off it's 4 days notice.
---
Hunters can also 1 hit aim shot lower level players in neutral cities, then feign death so the guards dont kill them. 
---
The amount this happens to warriors is why it takes so long to level warriors.
---
They don't need to poll, they already have that data from retail.
---
The difference in stealth levels is small, if you want an advantage in rogue vs rogue, dwarf can cleanse blind and poisons.
---
Also the male nelf sprint animation looks like a retarded version of the flash running, and their unarmed attack animations are ridiculous.
---
I went male nelf rogue for the meme potential.
---
Or Anathema :')
---
People who go on reddit and engage in these kind of surveys is an order of magnitude more hardcore and positive towards PvP than the actual average player though.
---
Lots of horde like to hide amongst the elite orcs and smash the lowbie groups... kind of like the allliance hiding amongst the elite dwarves in hillsbrad haha
---
The thing is that in time rp realms tend to become either very devoid of Rp or are very focused on it. Rpers tend to flock to the server that has the most rp on it which basically leaves the remaining Rp/RpPvP servers with little to no actual Rp. It has nothing to do with RpPvP. You were proabably on one server that was not very popular with Rpers. I remember in BC I played on a RpPvP server that had quite some Rp (even on Horde side).
---
Still according to surveys the demand for RpPvP is a lot higher than for pure Rp. So there is no reason to not have RpPvP servers at launch.
---
[Here you go](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=blood+fury+classic+wowhead)
---
TLDR: RPers are disappointed.
---
Non RPers carry on.
---
As someone who started playing in vanilla on an RP (PvE) server and then rerolled on an RP-PvP server when they came out, I believe that 99% of the benefit that RP-PvP servers brought was the surge in community building and organisation that took place before they even launched.
---
There were countless guilds and communities that sprung up, building hype and attracting more and more RPers with the promise of a more immersive experience. But through the years, as the hype died down, the game moved on and World PvP events on a massive scale became nothing mire than a memory, RP-PvP servers lost their identity. Even in Cata, the RP-PvP server I had played on since it released during Vanilla was pretty much unrecognizable to me and today it seems hardly different than any other PvP server. On the other hand, the RP (PvE) server I originally started on has still retained much of its playerbase and identity.
---
So for me, it doesn't really matter if a server is RP-PvP or just RP - what matters is the community that settles it and the reasons why they do it. In retrospect RP is the feature and PvP is the gimmick - it's really cool and it opens up some great options, but if players organise properly it's not needed (if you want to run a large scale W-PvP event, you can just have everyone tag themselves for PvP). On the other hand RP is really the underlying appeal behind these servers, so if I had to choose between the two I'd choose that every time.
---
To be honest they both looked absolutly clueless and unprepared for the question. My guess is they actually have no idea which server will go online. 
---
We just want old AV for one phase. To experience those unique battles one more time. Fuck the reward gear, you'll get it next phase. 
---
Your boring ass screenshot was fine by itself, you didnt have to point out the date landing on an American tragedy, karma whore.
---
You're over-reacting.
---
The amount of Rp on RpPvP realms varied from realm to realm. Most serous rpers tended to flock to one realm leaving the others basically as glorified PvP servers. This is why Blizz should have one or two max so there can be a healthy RpPvP community on those servers.
---
All of which you described can actually be applied to regular Rp realms too. Some players are gonna choose those servers because they can obtain rank 14 there more easily. The only difference between Rp and RpPvP is that you can attack players of the opposite faction in contested zones which might hinder some planned rp in those zones. But a lot of people want this because it adds immersion to the world which is what rp is actually about.
---
You won't convince them, even though you're right. 
---
Thank's for being useless, I understand what the skill does and nowhere posted does it actually say the overall % damage increase it gives over other races.
---
TFW People say they won't play without rp-pvp servers
---
Several reasons:
---
1. Cleave / whirlwind damage is higher.
---
2. Better flurry uptime since slower weapons eat less stacks. Autoattacks also generate more stacks with faster weapons, but abilities should generate the same amount of procs.
---
3. Crusader and other PPM based procs. They don't have forced procs per minute in vanilla, it's just a proc chance based on wep speed. Fiery weapon has 6 ppm, which means a 3.0 weapons will have a flat 30% chance to proc it. Spamming skills with a slow weapon leads to every skill also having 30% chance, so it procs way more often than 6 times per minute.
---
Time zone / playtimes? Your website doesn't have this information either.
---
I see you play on ED, are you intending to be RP as well?
---
I still vividly remember visiting Duskwood for the first time. I was 12 years old back in vanilla running around in elwynn when I crossed the river and got to the "Hushed Bank". The music completely changed and I saw a skull-level wolf that chased my ass back across the river.  It was one of those unforgettable gaming experiences. 
---
I think Enh shaman healing should be fine for everything except Raids, but you will definitely need to collect a set of healing gear as you level and do dungeons, and use that to heal when you are filling that role. Who knows how the crowd will be this time. When I played Enh Shammy in vanilla, I played DPS in many dungeon groups, but I ultimately prefer Elemental spec the most, because you get enough resto talents with it to have stronger heals for PvE and very powerful damage in PvP.
---
You know what the thing i hate most about gaming forums is? People feeling the need to defend game developers.
---
People criticizing a game on a forum is just about the healthiest thing you can have. As long as there are no slurs or hateful speech then it's all good.
---
Seriously, I don't know why some people start feeling bad for game developers or go to the "just be grateful" bullshit. Like Blizzard isn't gonna charge me $10 a month and make thousands off of me.
---
Listen, people are excited for the game. They are discussing the game. Some people like 1.12 AV, some don't. People are letting their voices be heard. Fuck off with telling people to stop complaining.
---
Understand that you can complain all day long about something, say Blizzard are making terrible decisions, all of that, and still love the game and want to play it. In fact, that's why most people are complaining, cause they love the game. This isn't North Korea, this is how a healthy forum works.
---
Good question.  I looked quickly for the exact same info today and couldn't find it.  
---
Do you need special server rules to RP?  Why not just join an RP guild on a PVP server?  
---
Most likely you would not just automatically bail on your guild/friends on your current server to start fresh on an RP-PVP server whether through transfers or starting from scratch.  Sure if things are not looking great at the time for you personally there is no problem just picking up and moving but otherwise ...
---
I can't imagine its more than 1-3% overall damage boost but I could be wrong. Most likely there won't be race change either so knowing is kind of important I'd say.
---
The challenge is finding a way to have a build that will let you actually be useful in raids, and still do well enough in PvP. I feel like Mages are great for being strong in both, and maybe hunter too but I never played hunter.
---
Won't do original AV because they need to use 1.12 version to be more realistic ... wont launch RP-PVP servers because they were later in vanilla (pretty sure the one I played on was released around the time BWL came out) ...
---
Remember, statistics done here is of the most hardcore players that will be on the servers. Surveys done as then very much affected by the attitude of these players.
---
What blizzard will see in their servers can be totally different thing. Because if your claim that MOST want RpPVP, thats what blizzard would put out there then. I think they see low demand on RP servers in general and just figure out that its best to have a PVE one, if there is only one server out there.
---
Regarding all RPers flocking to one server:
---
Maybe that's a regional difference. There were only two German RP-PVP servers in the beginning. Pretty quickly one was established as the Alliance-focused one and the other as the more Horde-focused (read: the one where there were more than 20 horde players). However I do remember hearing that when other RP-PVP servers eventually opened up, there was next to no RP and they became the glorified PVP realms you mentioned.
---
And yes, I concede the phenomena I described also applied to RP servers. I just remember always being a bit envious of (RP-PvE realm) 'EU-Argent Dawn' which was always hyped up to be the European hub of roleplay. And as I said, the constant discussions on the realm forum if "RP-PVP" meant that RP is optional. 
---
#UNDEAD

Master Race 
---
What do rogues and noobs have in common.
---
The both pick locks
---
That sounds about right for all roleplayers on all servers of every game. They're like housekeeper Willy in You-know-which scene.
---
Those are rookie numbers, you gotta pump those up!
---
Besides for people having to re-create their characters and start over or pay $ for transfers 
---
That last part sounds very appealing. So many people on regular PVP servers hate world PVP it makes no sense.
---
&gt; I'm wondering the actual % damage increase that Blood Fury

It's an imposssible question. If you have 500 dps then the increase might be 1% and if you have 100 dps then the increase would be 5%.  The link I provided you tells the actual increase in dps and if you took a second to do look it shows the formula for how much AP gain at each level. So thank *you.*
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZVghscMzxVxfoLo I'd go heart of the wild druid, can tank/heal dungeons and pvp. You can tweak some things of this spec, but this is the general outlook of it and the one I prefer.
---
Mmm, can't remember. But it was on episode 91, in the segment of the Four Horsemen (after 1:41:00)
---
You can make a conspiracy theory out of anything if you want to. And it's almost impossible for them to predict what the community might rage at; some ppl happened to rage this time, but that doesn't mean that there are enough raging ppl to populate RP-PvP servers. 
---
I saw the video and if you had actually listened in the first place they said that they will see how things unfold and if there is actual demand for servers like that, they don't mind making them. 
---
It's not like any community is very forgiving for devs making mistakes, it doesn't matter how many good things they've done in the past.
---
Were rp-pvp servers released in 1.12 or earlier?
---
I guess that's what most people will do until blizzard hears them. I don't see any reason why a simple PVP server shouldn't suffice in the meantime..
---
Becausw it's also about the interactions between the other guilds in the server. RP-PvP guilds clashing with each other
---
I honestly don't care about sharding (at launch/newbie areas) and loot trading.  They can do whatever they want with that and I am fine.  AV was disappointing but I can easily just not do much AV as it will probably just be base racing again anyway with how weak the NPCs will be.  The actual server I roll on though ... yeah thats a problem.  Sure I guess this means I just go PvP since I don't RP much anyway but I prefer characters actually having RP-ish names, running past RP events and maybe watching, and really just in an RPish mindset when I go kill alliance scum.  Makes the world feel a bit more lively and interesting but thats okay .. I will just settle for PvP and killing some dude named leeticemagez.
---
Moon Moon the melee moonkin, he can also heal with bandage and do some ranged dps with dynamite 
---
Which is exactly how vanilla was :D Hopefully won't be that much of a problem since they will have more than 1 server and it won't be extremely overpopulated like private servers are. Might be a bit annoying at launch though.
---
While leveling as a druid you should really tank, much easier to form parties. Druids are the best tanks for 5mans after all.
---
I am a simple man. I see Sodapoppin getting rekt, i smile.
---
The reactions thus far have been overly sensitive and submissive. Get hold of yourselves! The Horde needs men, not crybabies!
---
Yes I know that. Considering we're still months away from the start of summer and half a year away from the possible max release date, it's still too far away. At most we'll get "on or before September 30th" for a while. 
---
So can't there be multiple RP guilds on a PVP-Server?
---
And you can do this on any realm 
---
Yeah Benediction / Anathema that's right! Once he got that, I could no longer bear him in duels. (I was Ele Shammy)
---
I'm so nervous about the server balance. Would suck to start a character, get attached to them only to realize you're on the wrong server. I really hope they keep the RP and (hopefully) RP-PvP servers to one or two.
---
You sound like a bitter Hunter.
---
If you are rolling for pve, then troll is best.
---
Anyway the % damage increase is really an impossible question. It's a cooldown which means it won't be up that much and how much % of the fight it's up, well depends on your clear times. It's a flat attack power increase(25% of BASE) so it's stronger early than later.
---
The classic whining is very much like how the Brexit debate happened in my country. 
---
People campaigned for it, was overly surprised when they got it, now they have it - they don’t know how to implement it properly and there’s about 7 different versions of it that people are fighting for.  
---
math similar to crafting wands in early game. seems like crafting a wand is totally not worth it :D
---
I don't see this outraged negativity you write about here. 
---
Reporting in as another person who wants RP-PvP servers in Classic WoW! It's my #1 server type.
---
So many people ITT acting like Blizzard ruined WoW unilaterally. 
---
But really, they just listened to player feedback. People wanted LFG, they wanted flying mounts, they wanted ability pruning. A lot of those same people are on this subreddit, with 14-year-old unchangeable opinions based on a general lack of understanding and experience. A lot of them have really, really bad ideas for how best to implement classic servers, and they're really, really vocal.
---
Yeah, fuck you u/cryptowatching
---
Leveling wasn't too bad although there are definitely a few rough spots (late 20s wasn't so good iirc) and you can't handle more than 1-2 mobs easily unless retaliation is off CD.  With retaliation you could take down probably 4-5? or so mobs pretty easily especially if you had a HP potion but otherwise if you see a camp with 3 mobs next to each other you have very little chance of killing it without killing 1 with intimidating shout works its magic.  If during intimidating shout you get miss/parry/dodged then you basically have to run away because you wont kill that mob in time before the others get back.
---
Also anytime you get a new weapon things get dramatically easier.  No matter what though you will be using tons of bandages/food.  
---
I hope blizz will be able to deal with them
---
Or we end up with either a huge gold inflation or dm farming nerfs
---
&gt; Visit the MaNGOS forums and look for NPC discussion threads.
---
I do believe you'd still be PvP tagged in enemy cities, even on a pve server. Memory could fail me though. 
---
Boomkin being there just for cheerleading purposes
---
Like a mascot
---
Play in the RP server 
---
I was scared to even go over the river for a while and with good reason.
---
Later, Morladim kept me on my toes.
---
How sad when all of these things became threatless nothings in later expacs.
---
I don't think server balance in Classic will be as big of an issue as it was in vanilla. 
---
Sure, alliance RP will always will attract more people than horde RP. But back than it was multiplied by a general imbalance of alliance popularity. I feel like the horde became much more popular over the years and especially in a RP context, I think the chance to roleplay in the OG pre-elv horde will surely attract more players.
---
And I completly agree with you - concentrating on one or two RP-PvP realms per region is key.
---
Are you unaware on the extra restrictions on an rp server? It's definitely not the same as a regular PvP server. 
---
If you're going to be such a casual, go to retail ;0 
---
If u drop low hp u prolly panic and wont enable the racial
---
All my old wow screenshots were on Xfire and I didn't know they were shutting down until it was too late unfortunately :( sucksssss
---
We shouldn't be arguing whether or not blizzard should have RP-PVP realms.
---
Blizzard should just simply make a fucking poll so they can gauge what people want to play and in what proportions, it's that fucking simple. 
---
Holy fuck the entitlement lpl
---
M8 my day thanks
---
But 1v1 is the most important part of the game 
---
Spartan-level preparation is discussed.
---
And he said we thought we want it but we don't.
---
Hiw wrong he was.
---
Who cares most warriors won’t make it past level 20 anyway 😂
---
Realest comment ITT. Thats literally the only reason to play rp-pvp over rp.
---
I loved camping that horde quest zone in western hillsbrad as a nelf with cat pet
---
Im gonna make a 29 twink for it
---
They should just make 400 different server types so everybody is happy. 1.8 AV, 1.12 AV, 4 phase, 6 phase, balanced specs, classic specs, flying mounts, no flying mounts... I think you get the idea.
---
And some people wanted 4 stage content releases. Where's the justice for them?
---
Rogues have a good enough spec too
---
You just run far away for 30-40s. Or if you know where they are vanish in stealth and find them quick. 
---
&gt;how can I RP as the RedRidgeMonster without rp-pvp servers?????? 😭😭😭
---
My current timeline for what i wanted play. 
---
Rogue (the only class ive played from vanilla to bfa (hard to quit because of the amount of effort and time ive put into collecting stuff) also world pvp kings being able to blind and skin someones mob seems gloriously bm)
---
Warrior ( i want to try something different and either tank or heal) 
---
Paladin (realised i probably wouldnt raid tank so i didnt need to be a warrior but i could heal and tank dungeons and rets seemed like an awesome dueling class (judgement looks amazing)
---
Then i thought to change up my experience and play horde. Ive only played horde from cata and never leveled as one. 
---
Hunter (good pvp class, good leveling class and ive never played as range)
---
Mage (for the pvp and awesome dmg, )
---
Now im feeling Shaman
---
Shaman seems like it will be the best option? 
---
I can heal in raids, two viable pvp dps specs. Im looking to make friends and being a useful class that can help run people through content is something i find enjoyable. 
---
Being a rogue in bfa it makes it harder to help out. Where as being a tank or healer would make it 100x easier to make groups and help people gear up and form more groups.
---
 lately i have been leveling a healer and am enjoying the reactive play style. 
---
With all this in mind. 
---
Is vanilla wow healing reactive with peaks and troughs of game play, or is it more rotational? 
---
Do shamans have an easy time joining groups and forming groups?
---
Collecting is a big part of the way i play the game. What is the likelyhood that i will be able collectget teir sets, hand of rag, edge of insanity etc as a healer during the 24-26month timeline of vanilla
---
How many shamans are there typically in a 40m? 
---
How important is race choice? I would like to go orc.
---
If you can answer any of these it would be much appreciated? 
---
It will still be Hunters. Most warriors won't get leveled
---
A lot of assumptions here.
---
1.8
---
Take the cookie cutter pve spec
---
Find out what pve talents are most important to keep
---
move some other points for pvp talents ( you wont be able to get most of the good ones just some key options)
---
Whining and bitching because **bored**. Dumb, yes but it's really no more complicated than that. 
---
Pretty standard for gaming subs considering this site has the same kind of armchair know-it-alls no matter where you go :P
---
Sure but it's generally the hardcore community where the roleplayers are and those want primarily a RpPvP and not a regular Rp server. Lets say just 5% of people want to play on a Rp server and 3/4 of those want a RpPvP server. There would still be plenty of players to fill Rp servers.
---
Hotw is feral tho?
---
Maybe they rightly predict that tourists like you and your friends will quit and go back to normal pvp servers in a week and they'll be left with dead realms.
---
Nope, sorry. Means public raids are compromised. Yes, public/pug raids will happen in Classic. 
---
Still not as bad as orc or dwarf female
---
I see dwarf as a massive bonus
---
Troll is best for all!
---
Orc Female is the best racial/look combo in Horde for Rogue imo
---
We just need a mod to delete those posts. 
---
Having a child is not the same as quitting your job. The rules are totally different. Some of my old school friends became "professional mommies" because they just didn't want to work.
---
Lol look how mad reddit gets at being reminded that they're the vocal minority
---
Lmao
---
All I know is I was on Emerald Dream for years and the amount of RP fueld WPVP rivalries were amazing.
---
You sound like a noob who has no idea about vanilla itemisation. 
---
Holy paladins wear 90% cloth and leather until T3, because 99% of plate gear is shit for healing. 
---
The same applies to warriors, there is simply nothing better than truestrike shoulders for fury. What do you expect them to wear? Lolz valor shoulders?
---
Gameplay wise warriors have nowhere near the tools to fuck up when they are bad like hunters.  
---
Bad warriors go fury only, get told to stay where the tank is with his star mark the tank has given himself for visibility and gets told to hulk smash.
---
Hunter can multishot pull, break sheep with serpent sting/multishot, may not dismiss his pet when jumping down somewhere, keep growl on on his pet, lets his pet die all the time in AoE, does not know how to chain CC with feign death + trap infight.
---
I played on Defias Brotherhood and it was quite populated, there were lots of little rp-events and rp-talks with strangers, people walking in cities instead of running (that's the main sign of a true rolepayer xD), also some part of advertisements in trade chat were made in rp-style. It was early TBC, as far as I can remember. I was in a RP guild on the Alliance side.
---
i really dont like the rp-pvp snobbery ive seen on this sub in the past year or so. so many people desperate to let everyone else know they're too mature to play on a regular pvp server when really they should just acknowledge they dont appreciate internet culture.
---
Legit terrified by WoW? Yeah... not really
---
Right but we’re just talking about the bonus from the racial itself since everyone has the base 5% already
---
It only kicks in late at 40
---
RP-PVP servers weren't in vanilla though were they? 
---
There were RP-PVP realms in vanilla you absolute troglodyte 
---
Does this stuff seriously work, or is it just a silly joke?
---
RPers are not worthy of being called gamers
---
My experience on an RP-PVP server took place sometime during TBC, on Ravenholdt EU. I had no idea what roleplay was at that time, innocently making a blood elf warlock by the name of 'Bloodwarloc' (showing off my creative side!) which then got forced to have a name change at some point.
---
I somehow ran into a bunch of blood elf roleplayers in Silvermoon, and even though I had no idea what RP was at that point i just...played along, doing an awkward job of doing so, but fortunately I wasn't the only one who was new (I know it sounds cliché but we had a blood elf paladin with a variant of Sephiroth as his name).
---
I did enjoy my time there, as it introduced me to roleplay, a hobby that I've been participating in WoW ever since, and often it's been the only reason I've still been subscribed to the game, especially during downtime like BFA.
---
Unfortunately, maybe I'm too cynical, but I severely doubt there's going to be much in the way of actual roleplay on Classic RP-PVP servers. While I did start my RP on one such server, eventually in retail, everyone started moving off the various RP and RP-PVP servers to come to Argent Dawn EU, a high populated RP server, leaving just PVPers and raiders on the RP-PVP servers. 
---
Now, I know that's retail and not Classic, but I already think we roleplayers will probably be even more of a minority on Classic, due to the lack of transmog and more than eight races to choose from. I'm also a bit skeptical of how roleplay was conducted in an RP-PVP setting, outside of cities as it seems more annoying than anything if you and a few friends are heading off to kill a dragon in a DM event, and then suddenly a undead rogue ganks and teabags you.
---
Doesn't it have something to do with having Moonglade in common? 
---
TIL writing whine essays on reddit takes away the wheel from Blizzard
---
Seems like it would force more work on blizzard part moderating it since people will join it then go mental when they get killed during their RP events.
---
You intentionally hit low health using demonic rune to get a good proc then combine it with arcane power.
---
What spec would that be? You go full combat as pve rogue and have literally zero utility.
---
Noooo! Classic RP-PVP was just the thing that I wanted to play classic for! The big world pvp battles that played out like movies and such! I REALLY hope they reconsider. Even if they add them later... to start again would be way too time consuming! I just want to go all out at the start, playing the game I love, instead of playing a character knowing I'll have to start again later on a prefered server-type.
---
Urban internet joke from like year 2000.
---
No they arent. They said they are keeping gear that existed before 1.10. The same as it’s after 1.10 stats. They are only hating the gear that came after until the relevant patch.
---
Read harder before you try to put someone down.
---
Don't forget his second main, I Dont Know
---
You make a point but how is it any different from Paladins rolling on big 2H'ers, shields and healing gear? Or Druids who roll on DPS leather and healing gear as well? Warriors rolling on DPS leather wil definitely happen. Rolling on caster staves will require a sick min/max mentality to justify that, but there will always be those happy few.
---
If you're not trying to stay ahead of the pack and level with other people who play the game at a more easy pace the odds of losing these kinds of rolls will be a lot smaller I think. As always... if everybody if clear on these kind of things when the group starts you can avoid a lot of drama.
---
I once asked a Paladin to pass on Smite's Hammer because he would get the Verigans Fist quest after the dungeon (he dinged 20 inside). "Fair enough" he said, as he saw my crap 1H+shield (NE Warrior). I once won a roll for Hypnotic Blade against a Druid as a Lock... he wasn't the friendliest of people.
---
You must have misunderstood what I am asking for.
---
I've already tanked ever 5-man dungeon in vanilla.
---
I'm looking for a tanking guide where difficulty lies somewhere around 40-60 dungeons.
---
14 attack power is 1 dps, 1 dps times the speed of your weapon is the actual damage.
---
If you have 100 dps worth of attack power thats 100 dmg in 1 second weapon, 200 dmg on a 2 second weapon, 300 dmg on a 3 second weapon, 380 dmg on a 3.8 second weapon. You're better off googling this one.
---
Amazing!
---
Thank you for posting this. I'm like you reading this Reddit but not caring enough to reply everytime, and I'm sometimes afraid people who complain for every single thing will be taken as a representation of reality, where I believe a lot of people are just happy with the decisions and therefore don't post about it.
---
"A falling tree makes more noise than a growing forest"
---
I agree and I'd prefer it if it was completely scrapped but the potential damage it could do to pug raids is negligible compared to what it means for dungeon runs.
---
Keep in mind the polls on here most people don't vote if they don't care. 1 of each to server sounds good but you as an rp community need to get together and say "ok we want their but its clearly going to take a lot of blizzards time with reports over griefing during role play time." I've found the RP community to be far far younger than the average player and that's cool but they get very angry very quickly then lash out making more work for everyone. Also abuse of the right click report would be rampant so it would have to be removed from that server (should be removed from all servers though)
---
&gt;so good because you just spent 3 hours wacking fucking plainstriders with a stick and watching thorns do the majority of your damage. 
---
As always the internet blows everything way out of proportion
---
Definitely human. It's not quite as significant at 60 as it is in 70 due to engineering and a few changes to vanish, but the opener is an enormous advantage.
---
At 70, humans are definitely the best race for rogue pvp. At 60 I reckon dwarves have them beat. Orcs definitely don't.
---
I played on RPPvP servers because the maturity level were higher.
---
I refuse to believe you don't have better things to do with your time than white-knighting a publicly traded corporation.
---
Good, valid point that I completely forgot about. Last warrior I hit 60 with was horde and I remember getting Stoneslayer and being insanely grateful for it.
---
I was mainly referring to 1-50 dungeons. I also wasn't saying it would be wrong, just that they might get a bad rap!
---
Really confused on how paladins counter druids very hard ... like sure you cant kill a paladin but killing a shaman isnt very likely either.  In addition if you try healing as a druid in PvP?  Guess which faction is going to be purging all of your HoTs and possibly NS?  Playing against shamans as a druid sounds frankly terrifying and although I can do nothing to paladins at least they cant really do anything to me either besides HoJ stun me at a bad time which I will still take over getting purged and earth shocked.
---
Nothing in SM beats WWA and ZF is at the tail end of the range I put (and doesn't really have anything -great-).  
---
Uldaman has Stoneslayer (and if itemisation is in the mace that I forget the name of). I can't remember RFD having any notable 2h drops but feel free to correct me on that.
---
Just throw down 1 rp-pvp server for the account type and go from there imo. I don't think it would be super popular but popular enough to have at least 1 strong populated server. I feel 2 would be too many but hey who knows. 
---
I'm hoping that rp forums communicate and sort of pick the defacto server choice for rp or rp-pvp to maximize experience. i.e if retail had fresh servers and people agreed to go to Wrmrest Accord.
---
Saw a post on the anthem sub a few weeks ago with a picture of the folks that work at the dev studio. Caption was "remember, real people poured their heart and soul in to this game" like nobody was allowed to criticize their Horrible game.
---
That kind of attitude doesn't get anyone anywhere and is wholly unproductive in a similar manner to when OP and many others call for us to be "greatfull we are even getting classic".
---
Classic is far less balanced than live so most people will be rolling UD rogue for some redridge camping. 
---
It's not different per se, I just think warrior will be the most extreme example since they can use almost all item types in the game! 
---
People will migrate once they get corpse camped a few too many times questing
---
Then just don’t check every day, it’s not like they are going to just post saying ‘it is now released’.
---
No reason at all to tank other raid bosses, except for challenge and if you want a challenge then you might as well tank them with only class which would be worse for the job and that is mage.
---
Loot trading should have 2 recuirements.
---
You are inside a Raid ( not a raid group ).
---
You have masterlooter on.
---
There should be zero loot trading possible in dungeons. 
---
This is the second time you randomly leave that guild-link for no reason at all, which leads me to think this is a badly disguised recruitment post. 
---
Still the demand that clearly exists is for RpPvP. The trolls can be anywhere. This has nothing to do with RpPvP servers. I love to rp but don't want to be restricted in the rest of the game because of stupid PvE rules. PvP servers are more popular in general and Rp realms are not different here. The fact that Blizz said there won't be any RpPvP server just shows how out of touch they are with the Classic community. There are alreasy RpPvP guilds around which would all fall apart if there are actually no RpPvP servers.
---
But they already are going to release RP servers that constantly need GMs to enforce server rules. What makes RP PvP servers unique in that regard?
---
Did you get into your mums Ritalin stock again?
---
Deffias-Brotherhood EU, hail, hail, hail and kill!
---
You know if you guys actually made reasonable arguments and put them to Blizzard instead of acoustic screeching you would likely get it as a server option.
---
I am going to be a party pooper here, but do you all a favour for Classic: 
---
Touch of weakness does the same function and MORE damage than shadowguard against melees in a PvP situation. 
---
Touch of weakness also scale well with spell power and is SPAMMABLE while shadowguard is not. If a rogue opens on you as a troll he can get 10 melee hits in and 3 shadowguard procs can happen. For an UD if you spam touch of weakness after applying your dots you will get close to 10. 
---
Factor in you get an extra dot + wotf UD is an easy choice.
---
There exists a universe where the human wastes all 20 seconds of Perception
---
I dunno man, most of the posts I’ve seen have been for open-ended discussion for a particular objective. Case in point the RP-PVP server discussion. Passionate people state reasons why they’d like a particular feature or option or whatever. I’ve seen particular users getting salty or upset in retaliation to inflammatory comments  ok existing threads but mostly posts start from a place of honest intent, rather than “bitching”. 
---
Check your privilege - you’re bitching about people apparently bitching about something they’re passionate about. Everyone is here with a particular element of classic they love, and would love to see again. You’re essentially saying their opinions are irrelevant and to be satisfied with what they’re given. Can you imagine saying that to the Diablo community right now? They’re furious that their beloved franchise is reduced to a bullshit mobile game. 
---
Blizzard answered the fans by giving life to this project, we are a valuable source for them to “faithfully recreate” the world that we fell in love with 15 years ago. Being silently complicit created modern wow. 
---
Have fun ganking another shaman in classic lol
---
They might get rep by newcomvers or people who have not played for 13years, but the hunter meme is that they literally rolled on stuff they could not use or for their "petheal equipment".
---
You are right though about the more knowledgable. The more you know about the game, the more you know that armor classes are just a biproduct and shouldnt be interpreted as the only armor class the class is allowed to roll on henceforth. 
---
"you will have warriors rolling for leather and mail even after unlocking plate, "for dps"" implied to me that you share the notion that armor classes are the most important metric classes should look at to gauge if they are allowed to roll.
---
A gnomeregan hat drop at level 29 with +stam/spirit will probably be rolled on by all people in the group including rogues, warriors and hunters, because nobody has a hat yet, fleshhide shoulders will rolled on by warriors, because it gives better stats than most items while not having that much less armour.
---
Big dick stats &gt; some warmor.
---
Alex is that you?
---
Im gona build it in ECO survival))) now I have a goal
---
**Re**consider?  Uh, I don't think they said anything about RP-PVP realms one way or the other.
---
Ah the good old emergency monitor 😍
---
Maybe you should stop telling people how to feel about things.
---
See it's strange I've found the RP community to be very young. All for having all server types to cover all players, worried an rp-pvp server would take too much moderating."all right click report that guy who killed me during my rp event" types or the type to write blizzard a ticket asking them to stop the "griefing" of rp events.
---
Still would like to see one there because clearly people want it to some extent but maybe blizzard should just say "yup you can have it but we have a full hands off policy sort your drama yourselves"
---
I will leave it ti any other reader, if they were so bored as to read this, to decide whether your last statement holds or not based on what I have writren so far. Have a nice day bye.
---
Hex of weakness is pretty good for group pvp no? I'm genuinely asking because I want to roll a priest and the healing reduction sounds really nice to have
---
Wait whaaat? Get out of here scrub!
---
Why does everything have to do with someone character and emotional stance? Do you not understand causality?
---
&gt; II fully understand the issues with having 1.12.1, but to act like blizzard was going to do anything else is delusional.
---
Coding a few mobs is not the hardest thing in the world. People have been doing it on private servers for free for years with very satisfying results. 
---
Would you pay a guy to paint your house and somehow being okay them leaving one wall untouched?
---
"I don't wanna belittle what these guys did. They made a remarkable job and that wall was never important for me, it's only my son's. You can't expect a painter to do everything they're supposed to do after all, it's a hard job, very tough on the muscles." 
---
The worst part about this is that the original AV is important for everyone. It's always been a mix of PVP &amp; PVE. In the early versions of AV, your pve gear and talents would actually matter a lot because it was meant to be a mix of PVP &amp; PVE. It was a great way for raiders to do PVP without having to respec every week and a great way to feel like your PVE efforts mattered outside of raiding.﻿ It was great for people who sucked at pvp to be part of something where their own lack of skills wouldn't be a barrier.
---
You speak as if you understand the issue but you only see your side of the story. I don't even fucking know if I'm going to play this game. I comment for people who will, because WOW vanilla was a very rare perle that I wish people would experience and because it deserves to exist.
---
You don't give a shit about it obvious and you can't respect the fact that it mattered for other people and that it could matter in the future. You project all that shit into me when really you're just a self centered individual who can't take one for the team. 
---
1.12 is an abomination. AV in 4 minutes? "Yeah it's fine because reasons and you can't say otherwise because of your delusions and nostalgia and lack of respect for devs." Completely denying the certainty that it's going to be toxic for everyone as long as it satisfies your own need to see this unaltered but somehow I'm the guy with agenda. 
---
Give me a break, buddy.
---
I'd agree if he was saying "let's just trust blizzard and wait and see", but he's not. He's willing to accept what he's given because to him it doesn't matter and therefore other people's concerns aren't important to him. 
---
His entire post is about his own experiences and feelings. "I don't care" "I can't wait" "I just want to play". He's being every bit as "immature" as people making posts about their complaints, his opinion is just different.
---
&gt; with a dash of ERP unfortunately).
---
There's nothing unfortunate about it.
---
This is because there doesn't exist a kill condition, not because of respect or bullshit like that. 
---
Both. Lvl up gnome and get the recipe and make and equip the gear. Drop it and pick up goblin and wear both. 
---
And I'm still going to roll night elf Priest - just like I did back in Vanilla - because I don't care about this fucking meta that's surely gonna destroy mayor parts of the fun in classic.
---
It did exist in classic wow. 1.8 or some such.
---
Yes, they were added in patch 1.8
---
God i wish soulshards stacked.
---
Ony, one in mc, one in bwl, mobs in aq40. So many.
---
Holy shit a lagfist/outland video! Not the biggest fan of InFamous but at least you're not Craftwerk ;)
---
Greetings from Mirage
---
First off, you dont get that **years** of nagging made this whole Classic thing happen in the first place, after YEARS of not being heard.
---
What they have unintentionally done is made the communication to them, be constant nagging or **nothing** will happen.
---
AV 1.12 is the worse option and the argument of "oh u wont enjoy it after 3 time :)" is the type of mentality that made Retail dogshote.
---
Im not wholly against sharding at launch on **STARTER** zones for a very **very** limited time, but I have experienced 2 days of clusterfucking and I do not mind it. It is cool and fun to see do many people in one place, but again for a very **very** limited time and only on launch starting zones. It makes sense.
---
Dont try and high horse people into stop communicating with Blizzard about what is their **last shot** at being their customer, instead of farming karma, lets make Azeroth great again.
---
shut up retard pussy ass bitch id bash u irl
---
Ahh, this is a my bad moment, I literally didn’t take any notice of what sub I was on. My comment pertains to current retail wow, apologies for the confusion. As far as vanilla warriors in PvP I have no experience. 
---
Duskwood is probably my favourite Alliance zone.
---
In a dual scenario that is really unlikely.
---
But like I said, duel rogue vs rogue is a very very specific scenario.
---
This is basically how the internet's always been, especially with online games, yeah.  To put it simply: There's always going to be more negativity than positive on a game's forums because the ones that would post positive stuff are just actually playing and enjoying the game.  It's hard for even me to keep that in mind all the time, though.
---
gnomish first because goblin has a lot of general crafting stuff like sapper charges.
---
Even so armour is pretty a pretty important stat for levelling. Sometimes leather is worth it for sure, but if you start wearing half leather you’ll definitely be noticing the higher incoming damage and increased downtime while soloing.
---
he was a little above average, seemed to outgear a lot of opponents.
---
Yeah, it's a combination of typical internet behavior: A lot of people only bother posting stuff when they want to complain, and boredom.  It makes sense that boredom really accelerates or empowers the former.
---
1,415 people
---
UD is good vs warrior/priest/warlock, past that they have very few advantages in pvp compared to troll. Cannibalize is a lot of fun when combined with bandage - evocation - mana gem - potion combos.
---
I played an UD frost mage and it was really powerful, this time around I'm going Troll to honor Faxmonkey and get that sweet sweet berserking for pvp/pve.
---
I don't think so and if you think many low levels won't have their PvP flag turned off in RP you're kidding yourself 
---
Yeah trolls will be all over but personally I've found RPers to be very ummmm what's the word... Autistic? That seems a bit harsh but yeah people claim to be the king of a city and expecting tolls flipping the fuck out when you don't pay them etc. People having full blown arguements and actually meeting irl to fist fight over neither one wanting to be the one who lost the duel, just very very odd stuff. The type of people who would report you for having a name they dont consider RP enough. 
---
Prime example my RP character was black justice street wise paladin cop from inner stormwind (in the vain of a black dynamite type character) not rp enough aprantly because I didn't use thou and thee and my name wasn't Greggzan. 
---
Still in favour of the severs no reason to not include at least 1 even if blizzard think it will be a niche within a niche but I'm just saying the in fighting of the server would take like all of the blizzard GM and customer support teams time due to mass reports for someone who is "not rp-ing the way I want them too." 
---
Oh that's a funny coincidence, I've actually been RPing a paladin in that scarlet guild you mentioned! It was an all human guild taking on a view similar to the scarlet crusade. Narthae vom Scharlachroten Orden.  Though it had its fair share of drama, as all RP guilds do, it's been the best time during vanilla for me!
---
We had purges of the blighted land where we would crusade to old Lordaeron, and I distinctly remember our struggles with an all warlock guild, and the city watch of Stormwind, who we'd argue over city administration with. I never looked back to the PvP server I came from. I would definitely want RP-PvP servers again, just because RP of that kind wouldn't work on a normal RP server. 
---
The vocal minority are the *entire reason* classic is happening. More recently, they're the reason Blizzard is going to implement the objectively better 6 phase schedule. The vocal minority is just trying to make sure this thing gets done and gets done properly, even if there are always going to be some who are left disappointed in the end. 
---
The silent majority will be thankful for the minority's influences, even if they don't know it.
---
&gt;I was mainly referring to 1-50 dungeons.
---
U replied this to another comment. So why are you talking about end-game roles? 
---
If we take away end-game roles, Paladins will be equally as "bad". What makes you think Paladins will not roll on DPS armor (mail, leather) or Healing armor (cloth)? Same can be said for Shamans, Druids,...  
---
In the end it will come down to common sense, if I see one of the group members is a total arse I won't hesistate to drop the group. 
---
Are you kidding ? A BM hunter's pet generate more threat than a green / blue geared warrior !
---
Yes, wanting to RP in a RPG how silly of me to expect that to a feature. 
---
&gt; orcs being the strongest. 
---
ORCS ARE DA BIGGEST AND DA STRONGEST WAAAGHH.
---
Warhammer orcs would absolutely shit on WoW orcs.
---
combat daggers

---
you miss the expertise talent tho so care about hit ratings
---
and your cooldowns will be long
---
How the fuck does a troll female look better than an orc?!
---
Yes, you are correct, i was just reiterating what you've said. The heart of the wild spec refers to going 29/30 points in feral, rest resto.
---
Yeah, that Double Jump and the little lift from Glide really countered a lot of anti-walljumping measures.
---
wat
---
Reconsider? Have they stated there won't be RP-PVP servers?
---
lol, interesting I see
---
Is this a blog post or something
---
Really not a good spec for pvp at all you lack all the sublety utility that is so super important.
---
Sure you can open on people and probably oneshot them with thistletea with this build, but honestly that's not very impressive.
---
What does an RPPVP server do that others don't? Genuinely curious
---
The real chads carrying the raid. 
---
&gt;some might want some open world PvP, but that's such a small percent. Blizzard knows this.
---
Your post reads like the typical pro-retail player that idolizes a multibillion-dollar corporation that can do no wrong, completely disregarding core issues that were brought up by screaming "REEE JUST BE THANKFUL YOU'RE GETTING SOMETHING".
---
*laughs in Field Marshal's Lamellar*
---
Why is it negligible? PUG raids are going to happen constantly and it's gonna be super easy for either guilds to host them with free spots, or entire guild groups to join at once and need on items for their friends. It doesn't solve anything. 
---
I regret nothing.
---
Spam touch of weakness? Then you can't do anything else. With shadow guard you will get more dps output because you will combine it with mind flay and mind blast. 
---
That is your biased opinion, Classic is happening because retail wow has been bleeding subs for 9 years now. I don't think the 6 phases has nothing to do with the vocal minority, and the vocal minority won't make this any more proper than the devs could do themselves. The vocal minority is what led retail to where it is now.
---
\&gt; almost impossible to predict what community might rage over  
---
lol.  
---
Also this is a joke.
---
Any other classic news in this Q&amp;A?
---
we're going home bros
---
Oh man, that is awesome! The 'Scharlachrote Orden' (scarlet order) brought so much fun RP to our server, even though some people couldn't distinguish between IC and OOC and thought of you as elitist snobs.
---
Sadly I can't remember any specific character names from back then, but who knows, maybe we ran into each other? I actually was somewhat affiliated with the Stormwind city guards, I played a gnomish warrior who aspired to join them - safe to say, in character I wasn't too friendly with the Order. ;)
---
Yeah. All the gnomish stuff you only need to craft once.
---
Don’t go into TBC. If anything, keep adding content to classic with the spirit of vanilla in mind. Sure, the power creep after naxx would be a challenge, the gear wouldn’t have to be higher iLvl, it could be the same iLvl as naxx, lower (but easier raid), or there could be another solution.
---
But please don’t take the easy route and add TBC with the bullshit of splitting the population by adding Outlands, and adding flying mounts.
---
Wow to me takes place in Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdoms.
---
People would level just to have a fear ward priest. That means dwarf. Aside from raid use, which is sought after, fearward is instant cast and helps you and your group deal with warlocks/warriors + provides dispel fodder. 
---
Dwarves get desperate prayer too.
---
Also they can stoneform out of viper sting, bleeds, blind and rogue poisons for added survivability.
---
It's been already discuss. But yeah, I like the idea.
---
Problem is that as you will keep on creating new servers you will accelerate the desertification of old server.
---
So Blizz will need to be reactive and merged frequently to keep a healthy population everywhere. 
---
Literally NO ONE will want prenerf AV after they get a taste of it. I wanted it just to experience it and then I got sick of it after the first match and it was nothing short of a hassle. They could literally do an event to experience it for a day or two. 
---
And that’s a different problem to the one you initially flagged. Those epic Tarren Mill vs South Shore battles will still happen. As will raids on cities. Being on a PvP or not wont change that. 
---
It will change STVietnam and the like. Which for some people, like yourself, will be a loss. But it doesn’t remove the concept of world pvp from the game. Just makes it consensual. 
---
I love the stuff. I probably need to drink less of it though. 
---
Okay sure, tanking's good too.  I get that.
---
My overall point is how Druids back then weren't seriously perceived as anything but healers at Level 60.  The devs themselves, and therefore the game, clearly had the same perception because the main tier sets are only for healing, and they didn't care to tune the other specs correctly (although it's possible PVP balance would have been untenable if they had, but WoW PVP is always just silly stuff anyway).  At least they tried a tiny bit with a few Ahn'qiraj things, but that's about it.
---
Maybe the same perception by the community will be a little different in 2019, but I'm doubtful.  I'll still be playing Feral just for fun to see how it plays out this time.
---
Also, some fights can greatly benefit from 1 or 2 more healers than other fights, so that's what I was talking about and why I said Feral Druids healing for some fights is good, but for other fights they can do DPS or tank instead.  Perhaps I said that confusingly somehow.  Chromaggus is more unique in that it's as much about removing debuffs as anything else, but it's a similar idea.
---
I am a bit late to the party, but there's a whole guide for shamans wanting to tank raids and such: https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=1150
---
Patronising casual.
---
Haha "atleast you're not Craftwerk" a classic line! 😂 I remember Mirage! 
---
I am super out of the loop. So are only pvp and pve servers dropping at launch as of now?
---
No way. One of the reasons I love playing a warlock is having a tangible resource to manage. Get a Core Felcloth Bag and figure out the most important stuff you want to keep in your bags!
---
Fuck off with your yank "praise corporate" attitude.
---
For me personally StVietnam is more important than those big south shore battles. I want those unscripted dynamic open world pvp events that only happen on pvp servers.
---
Me and my brother were also planning to go on a RP-PVP server if possible. Think there are quite a few of us!
---
Well I'm not entirely sure they know RP-PVP is more popular than RP-PVE. I don't think they know what you guys want. I don't think they have a solid grasp on which is more popular. I think they have based this decision on experience with their first launch. Nothing else. I hope they find out sooner than later what the community prefers and makes the necessary adjustments. They have been pretty good so far at listening to what the community wants.
---
Was the quote a mistake or do you actually want to say something about it, i don't get it xD 
---
And how is anyone supposed to know you're joking with the post, reddit is literally full of ppl who think like this.
---
"Build a case for your reasoning and please try to listen to people who has another opinion." Quoting you here. So when the vocal minority has no effect, why are you even bothering? Isn't it exactly what you want from us? Listen to other opinions and building a case for reasoning? People reasoned why they think that 6 phases are better then 4 phases. Exactly what you wanted. I don't get your post. Sorry.
---
Shamans will easily find groups... Resto shamans are very welcome in raids. I think most guilds took about 7/8 shamans in raids?
---
You’re asking a deleted question apparently 
---
Two rogues will compete over gear... Shaman/Paladin would be nice I think

TBF, this doesn't calculate how long it takes to kill mobs, just the efficiency of farming mobs of varying levels :\^)

Hi. I always wanted to know this about the mechanics of nightfall:
---
every corruption and drain life tic has a chance to proc nightfall. What if I cast corruption on several targets. Do the chances add up?
---
My second question: is there a trinket in the vanilla game that makes the next spell instant? (For use with howl of terror or soul fire e.g.)
---
Thanks 
---
What would be the dps loss in % if I raided as SL (7/31/13) instead of DS/Ruin? I'd be losing on 3% crit and the Ruin talent (150% spell crit dmg instead of 200%).
---
5-15%? (depending on raid tier I imagine, i.e. higher crit chance from gear = bigger dps loss in the lack of Ruin)
---
This data only proves the use of resources for such a ridiculous server isn't necessary. Especially at launch.
---
We should create a anti gold farming mafia.Patroling,reporting to global and hunt them down and so on, like police:d When will get bored probably will try something like that:p
---
I loved duskwood; had to be really careful as a warrior in the graveyards but it became a good grind spot
---
It can work, the thing is that most of the time chinese need VPN to access most parts of the western internet and if they have VPN then it doesn't work.
---
This is the worst system I've ever seen. Being force fed tier? Pass. 
---
Boogie woogie gnomers! Boogie woogie!
---
That's your take on it. I would say they wouldn't be doing this at all if people hadn't been asking for it for 12 years and they hadn't seen what impact servers like Nost had. The vocal minority in retail changed dramatically over time as players left and joined, it's not fair to compare them. Besides which, retail is where it is now not because of one minority of players, but because they tried to make everyone happen at once and largely failed.
---
Were you supposed to write "I don't think the 6 phases has *anything* to do with the vocal minority"? That's what the rest of the post implies.
---
Im fairly sure this will get changed by a GM, especially with right click reporting. 
---
My guild &lt;The Gash Hunters&gt; lasted about 3 months before we were forced to change.
---
I'll still have this meme and the lulz it brings me 
---
Yes, multi-target corruption will increase your chance of proccing Nightfall. 
---
There is no trinket in the game that makes your next spell instant.
---
No mods, no masters
---
I don't have time to calculate a solid number, but it would be significant (certainly more than 10%).
---
Warlocks need Ruin to be competitive.
---
Easily yes.
---
But I think it's important to have some patience, it is likely that blizzard will further improve on the system that they currently stand with. 
---
Yes there is penalty based on level. Here is from a blue archived post:
---
If your target is the same level as you, a spell has a base chance to hit of 96%. 
---
If the target is +1 level compared to you: 95% 
---
+2 levels: 94% 
---
+3 levels: 83% if the target is a mob, 87% if the target is a player. 
---
+4 levels: mob: 72% player: 80% 
---
+5 levels: mob: 61% player: 73% 
---
Etc... 
---

Our guild &lt;Seal Cub Clubbing Club&gt; had the same issue. We were forced to change it to &lt;Seal Cub Hugging Club&gt; within a couple of months.
---
Still well worth the lols
---
Hey, that's my survey!
---
Same here! It’s the only way to experience the game fully. It’s also the type of server that attracts the kind of mature, responsible player that wants Classic in the first place.
---
How are we truly gonna RP something like the Scarlet Crusade, the Freebooters, Syndicate, Grimtotem etc on a PvE server? Just doesn’t work that well, I’m afraid. 
---
Form a community of RP-PVP'ers and join one PVP realm together and roleplay together?
---
It's all about typing naughty words into chat and pretending to have sex. That, or "MAGIC MISSILE! MAGIC MISSILE! M-MM-MMMAGIC MISSILE!".
---
To be honest I'd rather have dynamic respawns than sharding. Both screw fair progression to the race to 60 anyway.
---
Sorry but I disagree, AV should be an hours long battle, that is what the charm of it was actually, sharding to make it easier to lvl.... I mean really??? No RPPVP servers... wow just ignore the most hardcore fans of your game will you? All we wanted was a Vanilla clone and all we are getting is NewClassicWoW we did not ask for an easier version of Vanilla, we wanted that feeling of actually achieving something not like the give away they are apparently making. yeah playing Vanilla is hard to you can respec every 2 mins nor share your loot, but that is the charm of vanilla. 
---
I played on several German RP-PVE and RP-PvP Realms during Vanilla (Zirkel des Cenarius, Die Nachtwache, Die Ewige Wacht and Kult der Verdammten) and one thing I learned pretty early on: avoid the forums as much as you can. The meta discourse about RP in the forums can and most likely will ruin your ingame RP experience in the long run. 
---
Well there you go, then they should be in Classic as well.
---
So first they were complaining about others complaining.
---
New kind of people, complaining about people complaining about people who don't like you complaining.
---
Shit just got serious. 
---
Mmmh I wonder which category I now fall in... 
---
Did the "Report player" feature actually ever DO anything? I cannot believe Blizzard would ban a player for killing another player on a PvP realm, RP or not.
---
Hi I haven't played on RP-PvP at all and come up with a lot of make belive in a reddit thread so I can get free karma.
---
No, this isn't something that happens on RP-PvP servers and if it would. They'd get banned anyway.
---
&gt;  Do tanks get priority over DPS warriors for typical DPS gear? No way.
---
If you play in a guild worth their salt it's giving shit like Accuria and DFT to the main tank first. You want him to keep aggro mate. 
---
It's supposed to be about you playing your character as if you were actually living in that world.
---
But it usually involves sexual fantasies. See also: Second Life.
---
Have to disagree. EU Defias Brotherhood was rather vibrant, at least in BC days.
---
Argent Dawn was bigger, but the quality of RP there was also.. ehr.. of varying character. I recall the Scarlet scene being pretty much centred around Goldshire and Stormwind Cathedral. Which is pretty ridiculous.
---
Leaning towards that as well. RP:ing on a normal PvP server can be.. frustrating... 
---
That's the point. People who asked for classic servers where the vocal minority. No private server got more then 10k players. Let it be 20k or even 50k. What are 50k people in comparison to some millions? 
---
For retail, did you play Legion? Blizzard did a lot right with the addon. People liked it and the subnumbers where growing. BfA on the other hand is a mess. What most players wished was a new Legion. What they got where twerks and reworks. New bad implemented "improvements"  and stuff nobody ever asked for. Blizzard stoped listening a while ago but with classic you get the feeling they started to listen again. It may be false but it's not on you to destroy the hope of the vocal minority.
---
Human, the attack animation is much better than nelf
---
Yes for bag management space, so excited for summons actualy beeing strong (infernal, doom guard)
---
Is the fire talent tree worth it. I only rememmber trying it once. I built mostly aff or summoning.
---
What would be a good way to build the third tree?
---
Maaan Todeskrallen was my Horde Home :). Best Server I played on by far!
---
Unfortunately they'll all be farming Dire Maul. Can't gank people if they're in an instance.
---
Well start harvesting!
---
Most of the hardest neckbeard guilds stream and release speedruns and whatnot on YouTube, so you tell me what they are hiding.
---
lol that's clearly 4chan.
---
It doesn't work at all period. WoW doesn't send anything over plaintext.
---
Druids turn into bears and block flight master in Ratchet, you want to fly but you actually hit the druid and guards pummel you for it.
---
I'd like to invite all fellow (or prospective warlocks) to join the Classic Warlock Discord:

https://discord.gg/zMJMh3p
---
We have a really great environment, with lots of info ready for you. We'll try our best to answer your questions as well. Please join us and have a great time in the Shadow Council!
---
This assumes you are up against a somewhat skilled rogue that will kick your flays. 
---
Plus with spell power coefficients, touch of weakness spam provides a higher DPS (with good gear) and is more stable (since you can’t get spell locked). 
---
Thank you
---
I think you are loosing way too much damage for progression raiding. For dungeons and 10mans (UBRS) it's fine. SL is only good in 1v1 pvp so there is no reason to do it in BG's even.
---
If they don't change the respecc price most ppl will run SM+Ruin. Great for Farm, PvP, Raids and Dungeons.  
---
Indeed, in vanilla i ended up on a Rp server, purely because rp-pvp wasn't a choice. And by the time they released, i had already comitted to the characters i had on the pve realms.

Repost because apparently auto-mod took it down because i mentioned a private server, sorry if it's a duplicate reply:
---
Wow  is in my family blood, my brother really got into it when he was 10-11  years old literally running ICC heroics, i vividly remember the guild  master paying him real money to actually speak in the microphone (he  would just talk through text and listen in ventrilo) because they  thought he was bullshitting when he said his age, sure enough they heard  a prepubescent boy and sent the money.
---
As of now my brother plays the game off and on, when he does play it's usually on vanilla pservers.
---
As  for my father, i don't remember him being much of a raider or pvper but  at the same time this is very early vanilla going as far as beta days  when i was so young i barely even had that much cognition yet, all i can  say is i remember him being a mainly resto druid healer night elf who  farmed alot and played more for the gold rather than gear, but back when  he was addicted to the game i just watched him play and never really  played myself until lateish vanilla early-late tbc when i farmed for him.
---
For me, besides farming for my dad  which arguably wasn't me actually playing the game, i think i really  got into it when wotlk came out, then i quit late cata and in 2015  started playing private servers and whatnot, now i just play both  (censored pserver name) and retail, but on retail i'm mostly just goldmaking for wow  tokens so i can add to my wow subscription in preperation for classic,  because if you have an already existing retail sub you apparently get  full access to classic too.
---
You can still engage. 
---
My guild &lt;Nordland&gt; got dissolved by a GM during retail after being reported. Turns out it was an old pro-nazi magazine no longer in production.
---
Well, PPM things are scaled pretty well with slow weapons, also you have Overpower/Whirlwind, also your Heroic Strike uptime is higher on slower weapons(because you'll need much less rage per sec for HS).
---
Try 2 holy/disc priests dueling, infinite loop achieved. Lasy time i tried i got bored after 30 mins and forfeit to do something meaningful.
---
Blizzard already states they won’t do that. They won’t run two MMORPGs, which makes sense. You either get nothing after naxx or you get tbc.
---
My wife and I were going to go RP or RP-PVP, but if they don't have RP-PVP then it looks like it's just RP.  Which we are fine with, as neither of us are big fans of PVP and the type of douches you tend to see there.
---
tall blue human, swole green human, dead human, cow.
---
So if you're not rolling tauren gtfo lol.
---
It's not like they are being secretive and hiding the release date.  They simply don't know what it will be yet.  I'm sure once they can confidently estimate a date they will announce it.
---
Have you seen this sub lately?
---
They also said they wouldn’t to realm transfers, faction changes, and character boosts. They also said they would never make classic servers.
---
I also don't want TBC, i want vanilla forever. I just thought this would be a cool idea to keep vanilla fresh in a way that we know it would work.  
---
I think it could be a good idea to add some new content to vanilla but i think it's very risky since it could make it better but probably not, probably any new content to vanilla will change it in a bad way...   
---
I'm one of the "NO CHANGES" guy =P  
---
Thank you for your reply! 
---
Most PUG raids I've taken part in have a +1 system so if you win a piece of loot you can't win a roll vs someone who hasn't received any loot yet. This dis-incentivizes people to roll need for their friends because they could miss out on some loot for themselves later down the line. 
---
You know how Blizzard are, I'd rather have limited loot trading than loot trading on every item and that's why I believe our best bet is finding some middle ground where the potential for abuse is limited. To clarify again I would prefer loot trading to just not be a thing like you but I've grown cynical over the years and I don't think Blizzard will revert this decision due to their stubbornness.
---
What is that website for? It looks interesting.
---
Oh look, it's the predictable backlash to the backlash. Never fails.
---
RP PvP is some of the most fun I have ever had playing a game. I'd argue in some points of this game's history, RP-PvP brought a lot of the best PvP players to them because of the constant action driven by RP players dumbassery like raiding Aerie Peak or Arathi Highlands. Even if they didn't want to RP at all, People just wanted a server with action. Emerald Dream in Cataclysm for example. 
---
I happened to really like old school AV.
---
Be well.

Yes, thats why i said that as less people are playing, old "Final Servers" could be merged together and all players that went through all vanilla content would join up in a server.  
---
Thank you for your reply!
---
You don't need RP servers to RP.
---
*places dunce hat on your head*
---
I have seen 10-20 different BIS lists but this one is by far the most complete \^\^ Thank you
---
You clearly don’t understand the issue at hand. If they make two actively developed MMORPGs on the same franchise they are basically just competing with themselves. It is not the same as you examples at all. They can change their stance on the things you mentioned, but as long as retail lives it makes no sense to give vanilla original content. If they do they have to split their good ideas over two games. “Oh this would be a cool raid”, but then only one game gets it? Or double development just for the same piece of content? None of this is relevant to your examples, but running two games of the same genre and *same franchise* is dumb on so many levels. They give us classic because it is already made.
---
I think he's a contrarian that thinks getting angry is content but streamers seem to like him oh well.
---
What announcement? Where?
---
I think they became popular around BWL? Either way its certainly a quick way to wipe on ony.
---
Found Touldane
---
Classic and retail share subscription so it's a net gain to have an internal competition.
---
Nope, mainly due to Ion saying there aren’t going to be rp-pvp realms .
---
Not if there is sharding.
---
Touch of weakness does not so damage what am I not seeing here? 
---
&gt;Actual dedicated role-players made up around 10% of the server population, whereas the rest could be divided in two groups:
---
Group A: The RP-Tourist. "I dont want to engage in RP but I like the idea of playing on a server where I could rp! Yesterday I saw someone slow-walking through Stormwind, that was wild!"
---
This has happened to normal RP-servers over the years as well. People kept coming for the immersion and ''mature'' community and eventually they started outnumbering the actual roleplayers. The only way I see any significant roleplay community taking form is when Blizzard starts taking the rules for these kind of servers seriously. I doubt this is going to happen, considering they haven't bothered to enforce anything on the live RP-servers in years.
---
Yeah he's around there 🤟
---
No, it’s not. It’s a waste of development. They would have to split development over two games, thus doing less for each game. Most will only play one so the result is everyone gets less.
---
Furthermore, they have to run two games development on one sub fee. It is just not a gain at all, no idea how you got to that conclusion.
---
I agree to some extent, it could be solved by having X amounts of “historical” servers (after Naxx, no new content).
---
Yeah dwarfs are the best disc priests for sure. But as shadow jumping out of shadowform to desperate prayer will make you too vulnerable for hard melee hits.
---
With sw:p and dp you can kill a hunter before his viper sting will do noticeable effect. 
---
Btw no you cant do too well in only blues. Crafted gear may get you to BWL and even some AQ fights but you wont kill anything past that without getting some real gear. And im talking the best of the best crafted gear here. There are huge DPS checks in every raid. 
---
I'll be certainly giving this a shot when appropriate.
---
Literally mashing heroic strike on GCD on 4HM.
---
It's a meme as far as I know.
---
Thanks
---
For early 2005 is the key phrase here.  None of the opponents here seem to have any clue what they’re doing... 
---
&gt; makes the next spell instant 
---
The only thing I can think about with such effect is Edward the Odd's mace proc aside certain class spells. But locks can't use maces (and well, they shouldn't be in melee range either...). 
---
Exactly. And some time after we are on Phase 6, new "progression servers" would be released on patch 1.12 and go through the same content plan.
---
It’s just another wow classic fansite really. We talk about the game in the forum and there’s downloads for wallpapers and guides and stuff.
---
I wonder if they will do anything about &lt;Naga Stole My Bike&gt;.
---
PvE, PvP, and RP. No RP-PvP.
---
I remember getting someone with a name I wanted to force name change by telling a GM that it was a Swahili curse word. I'm sure I wasn't the only one who did that.
---
The data, as with all polling, is an attempt to represent a wider audience. No one believes fewer than 20,000 people are gonna play Classic.
---
Thanks for the response!
---
It does. It is slightly lower than shadowguard but with high spell power this becomes a neglible difference. 
---
There is an interesting interaction with flurry procs between Mainhand speed and Offhand speed and crit%.

---
&gt; We’ve gone back and reconstructed many of the most heavily affected drop tables as they existed prior to the 1.10 patch, and we’re planning to **update the drop tables alongside the Ahn’Qiraj War Effort.**
---
so that doesn't sound like they're changing gear at the same time as later content is released?
---
Lol, Human racial gg
---
There are lots of strategies and play styles that are much better but there are still guilds even on private servers who do things a more traditional way is all I'm saying
---
Iv always remembered the rp-pvp servers as pretty low population. but then again, maybe there were way to many of those servers in vanilla. if you would have combined them they would have been a decent server. ( i never played on one, this is just speculation )
---
Ok :) Do you think it would be possible to put the program online so we wouldn't have to download something to use it? I usually look at stuff like that at work and can't download stuff here.
---
Mage: great cc, best caster damage throughout most content, great raid utility with food buffs and sheep, easy to grind gold via aoe farming.
---
Warlock: fear is good for pvp but a bit broken if you’re alliance as undead easily break it, you get a pet (personal tank or bonus dps), raid utility with summons, easy to grind gold as you can solo lower content, it’s annoying to farms shards and you effectively lose an entire bag. Free mount at 40.
---
Mage will probably see more raid demand but there will likely be less warlocks, especially on alliance.
---
Mage does better dps (generally) until later content when they become about equal. Mage develops a more interesting cast sequence later on whereas warlock basically stays the same.
---
It’s impossible to say “go mage” or “go warlock”. They’re both good choices.
---
If you’re time poor and want to pvp more I’d lean mage but personally I’m going warlock.
---
Human gets the opener (perception), and even if the ofc resists it, the human still gets to dispel the kidney shot, 2 combo point and 5 second stun advantage minimum, pretty significant advantage
---
This is super sad. Blizzard please release at least one RP-PVP server per region.
---
Sm/ruin is a happy middle ground.  It's not min/maxed for pvp or pve but it more than holds it's own in both.  
---
You don't have to download anything, it's a website.
---
RIP Taintpuncher the paladin.
---
You can tank any and all 5 mans with any spec. Yes, that includes endgame dungeons like BRS, BRD, etc.
---
The best advice I can give you is that AOE tanking is barely a thing for a Warrior. In retail, you have tons of AOE abilities to spam and effortlessly hold threat on an indefinite number of targets. In Classic, you hardly have any AOE threat generators as a Warrior. Thunder Clap is absolute garbage and can only be used in Battle Stance, so that's out. Battle Shout and Demo Shout are the two reliable AOE threat generators, and that's not much.
---
You're going to be tanking a few targets at a time and holding threat on all of them by rotating between the targets and using single target abilities. Your biggest threat generators are Revenge and Sunder Armor. Revenge will be your top priority when it procs and Sunder Armor is to be used as a filler. Heroic Strike will not be used unless you have excess rage, and that almost never happens in five mans. For pulls, you'll mark your main target and start but popping a few sunders into him, and then tab target between all the targets you are tanking and using Sunder and Revenge at your leisure. If you need to maintain threat on more than a few targets, spamming Battle Shout is your best bet as it does more threat the more people it affects. Shield Bash also does a decent amount of threat, and you should use it on cooldown given there isn't any interruptable ability you should save it for.
---
Mitigation is mostly passive in Classic. Simply putting a shield on will do most of the work for you. You do have Shield Block, which you will basically use on cooldown (unless the mobs are about to die or something). Just go in and be confident. tanking five mans is no big deal and you will learn a lot just by doing.
---
Drop tables. Not stats. Drop tables.
---
They are removing the 1.10 gear from places but they are not changing the stats of gear that existed in the game prior to 1.10 but had their stats changed in 1.10.
---
This is why this community can be so annoying. They literally spell out what they are doing and you people are reading into it wrong, then when it comes out you will freak out and sperg over them lying.
---
/bump
---
I remember a guild of that name not getting slapped down in TBC on Dalvengyer, Kool Kids Klub wasn't so lucky lol.
---
&gt; Option 3) All the servers that are on last patch become a “Final Server” after some time. Open up new “Progression Server” where players can create new characters and progress through the patches as it was a new server
---
This is what private servers have been doing for over a decade and it's proven to be quite successful.
---
It's possible Blizzard will think of doing something like this if Classic is successful enough, it comes at no cost.
---
During Blizzcon Ion hinted at something along the line of wanting to make a plan for staggering releases that can be reused, so maybe ...
---
$1000? You don't need to spend that much! The general consensus is that classic wow should have good optimisation as it's using the leigon engine (So all the performance updates) with it. I can't imagine it being anymore demanding than current wow. Get an i5 (avoid the U type if possible, common for laptops) and a decent graphics card. Can't really see you needing to spend any more than $600. 
---
Oh i just figured out how to work it. I opened to Barrenschat and saw the downlaod link and assumed. Thank you :) 
---
Your question is two parts, so I'll make an example for both.
---
To make the problem relatable, simply remove the words RP.  Yesterday Blizz announced only PvE servers are going to exist.  If enough people whine about it then we'll possibly add PvP servers in the future.  Guaranteed, many people wouldn't play if they're only PvE servers.  
---
To answer the second half.  Do you really want to scatter RPers around and toss them in with the next hard core PvE titans of Tichondrius or the next trolls of Goon Squad reborn?  We just clearly don't belong and wouldn't be welcomed on most servers, wouldn't have RP rights to protect ourselves from trolls, wouldn't have lore friendly players, etc.  Just as importantly, now the thousands of RPvPers have to try and find eachother across PvP servers.  Try to form guilds and communities with zero guidance out the gate.
---
Now to mention the weekly. "PvP servers are the true WoW experience, change my mind" threads.  Some RPers still don't want to watch a field of Horde take all the Devilsaurs without a fight or whatever.
---
How do you think RPers feel about now?  I tried to convince myself to just roll RPvE yesterday but there's no way I'm giving up on my biggest joy of the game because people with no horse in this race don't want to listen to the minority whine about clearly being an afterthought.
---
P.S. The other guy besides you that left a comment reply about "why don't they make 400 server types to please everyone trololol" is a perfect example of the problem.  He's the majority, so yeah I'm super hopeful...
---
I played on Ravenholdt EU and had a blast. I fully expect to play on a RP-PvP server come classic and would be quite salty if they didn’t open one.
---
Well, yea. No shit. Who likes getting ganked in redridge by some no-life level 60 rogue for 6 hours straight? Lmfao
---
Is playing an alliance warlock as rough PvP-wise as they make it out to be?
---
Thats the only time a man can complain, Bran. 
---
Just with some experience of the private realms scene, there is well over 1/2 million people playing private realms EVERY week, its probably even gone up since the classic announcement :D
---
It will just be a gang bang fest in Goldshire when people get sick of dying in STV.
---
We need to go deeper.
---
Now is the time to vent &amp; let our feelings be known, before the actual launch. Once the game goes live, it will be very difficult to ask them to devote development resources towards going back &amp; making changes (again) - so you're wrong, this is actually the best time to have these discussions. Maybe you are in the wrong subreddit if you want to simply sit back &amp; hang out.
---
&gt; but apparently aren't getting one
---
where did you get this from?
---
If the only game you want to play is classic wow.. then any laptop with a designated graphics card will do...
---
However.. to me it's extremely unlikely that you would not want to play any of the newer, more demanding games that will release in the future.
---
And also.. a desktop in my opinion will always be better (maybe not cheaper) than a laptop.
---
So if I were in your shoes, I would build my own micro ATX desktop
---
Their tier sets are actually good and the wear them. 
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKx3qqbdMfY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKx3qqbdMfY) watch this
---
No t2.5? I'm outraged. 
---
Fair enough. I hadn't really given that racial a second thought.
---
The real advice is just to never spec prot at all.
---
Fury or arms tanking for threat all the way till naxx
---
lmfao
---
every class works fine as a casual just play something you like you know?
---
Shouldn't take you 6 hours even on nost launch lol. Group up with 4 other scrubs and go grind lvl 6 mobs outside of the starting area 
---
Bruh reread his title.
---
Pros:
---
Very easy leveling 
---
Good pvp no matter what. 
---
Low skill floor but high ceiling both in pvp and pve
---
Tier gear is actually really nice
---
very good pvp as pve spec/gear
---
Cons:
---
They don't really do the best dps, mc/bwl you do alright dps, but AQ/naxx you are literally the buttom. A problem then occours that guilds don't allow many hunters in their raids, and a lot of people play hunter, so you can have difficulties finding a guild, and if you wanna be a big dick on meters then you are out of luck.
---
Pro/con: Pet management is really difficult, this can be fun because it's a challenge, or it can be a pain in the ass
---
No boomkin, Enh, or ret :(
---
Solid lists though.
---
To this day i have no clue what RP realms do, look or feel like :p
---
I searched a few time online and watched people talk about it, but could not understand what exactly is it you do.
---
\+1 is preventative as long as it's not guildies trying to boost one or two members. This is the issue with the trading debate; the example cases that are often used are very real, but very specific. The *majority* of players wouldn't be affected by loot trading, but there are those of us that have seen the very ugly side of it and know how dangerous it can be to the integrity of the server community. 
---
Better, in my eyes, to just straight-up not implement it. Genuinely mismanaged loot can still be traded between players via support tickets, it just takes a lot longer. It's up to the community to identify and blacklist players who are either ninjas or abusing the loot system to their advantage, just as it was back then. 
---
Also, Blizzard haven't actually confirmed loot trading yet AFAIK. All I've seen is that they're contemplating it.
---
The playerbase for Classic doesn't care about retail and vice versa. Not developing Classic = the players quit and Blizzard never gets their money.
---
I like a lot less forced changing of names unless its just overt, I like the laughs. &lt;Naga please&gt; is funny.
---
One of my personal favourite reasons is they're the best RP feeling class. You take your pet, which can be hard to do, have to level it, gain it's loyalty by feeding it. You had ammo you had to manage. Certainly one of the more involved classes. 
---
It's true though, you won't be topping the dps charts, but you'll become a more utility based role. It can be hard mastering a hunter due to their drawbacks but a good hunter is obvious (especially in pvp).
---
Hunters are fun east and OP. But yeagh anything
---
I mean its something, but I would roll Undead for sure. One day when you find yourself doing PvP as Shadow, not having that Inner Focus Devouring Plague is just gonna eat you up inside. Will of the Forsaken is also obviously insanely good. I tried a lot of Troll Priest and the only notable good thing about them is that they can proc stuns on casters with the shield, but it feels better to have everything Undead has. 
---
0.5/10
---
There is no DK or monk in vanilla, my dude. What is it about those classes you like playing? Also, there are weekly threads on Wednesdays to help pick classes, I'd encourage you to read through those as there is A LOT of wisdom and videos that could help you out.
---
Did I mention Naga STINK?!
---
advantage : its fast and easy
---
disadvantage : you have to play a hunter
---
Username checks out
---
Hey you listed the three specs that were unplayable in vanilla 
---
thanks for the reply!  I had an alt ele/resto shaman in BC/Wrath and loved him; only thought about enh to change it up.  I glad you reminded me of ele, I feel less apprehensive about lvling a shaman now.  Thanks! 
---
Bad troll is bad 
---
My answer to all 7 is shadow priest.
---
I could recommend anything but a warrior. 
---
Just keep an eye out on r/BuildAPCSales Prebuilts have been competitively priced vs building and even often beat out something you could have built. The issue is they likely cheap out on the power supply, RAM, motherboard and add bloatware. One for example will have more than enough power to run wow and most other newer games at a decent frame rate depending on graphic settings. https://reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/avrm2f/prebuilt_skytech_archangel_vr_ready_gaming_pc/
---
Do some research on r/buildapc and see if it appeals to you at all. I love building computers but if your hearts not in it, it probably wont be the most enjoyable experience. You can also find laptops for sale on buildapcsales.
---
Hober here! Sup!
---
- The class that you want to play. Since you are casual, you might as well focus on a gameplay that suits you instead of thinking of raid viability
---
- Professions? Engineering + wathever you like. Engineering is either a BiS profession for both PvP and PvE, but it's also the most fun profession ever
---
So what people keep wanting are tbc servers. Every discussion about how to handle post naxx WoW is to progress to the next expansion.  
---
I personally would rather see some more content produced off of classic.
---
so removing and adding items is #nochanges
---
but adding npc's in AV and possibly removing them later is not #nochanges?
---
to me, the blue post about progressive itemization is still pretty vague, we don't know the exact drops they are leaving out/etc - and it does leave the window open imo for stat changes that occurred in retail vanilla for some items ex https://i.imgur.com/Iaen3Cl.png
---
&gt;What part of they don’t have data of things prior to 1.12 do you and this community not understand?!?!
---
I'm sorry, blizzard has been caught lying about many aspects of what data they do and do not have, so no, I don't believe them. I also don't think it would be very involved to add these npc's they know were in the game back. you act as if every fleck of snow has to be in the exact spot, when we're saying - 'hey, wasn't there a mini boss in the middle of the map?'
---
and to end, you've been arguing that you could zerg AV with or without buffed npc's, before or after 1.12 - so why do you care if we want an earlier version? if there's no difference to you, but there is to me, why do you care? let us make our argument to blizzard in peace and let them decide - why is it your mission to undermine someone wanting something THAT WAS IN VANILLA to be in classic?
---
Neither. They both had bad times joining LFG queues in classic 
---
Yea guild names can be tricky, i got banned for a few days for "Gas chamber gaming'
---
You should rather roll demonhunter. 
---
Before Intercept u can do nothing in a real 1v1 (both full hp and same lvl), 
---
u ll be tagged as free frag most of the time by rangers in WPvP,   
---
but after lvl 30 u start to have fun, intercept + hamstring is frightening for hunters, warlocks or some noob mages, they can't run anymore
---
and after lvl40 as arms, mortar strike makes self-heal stop working, that's it, u reached true joy as a unstoppable mass of death  
---
Fury is dmg dealer, but u ll miss something, fear is not a problem since u have deathwish, 
---
but those who can avoid the massive dmg u can do ll frustrate u more then arms spec  
---
Maybe was the lack of overpower, maybe this guys self-healing all the time, fury warrior for me is weaker in pvp
---
Pick a class that suits you most, based on your gameplay preferences from other games. Any will do, they are all interesting to explore (again, depending on what playstile you like). I could recommend druid as it can stealth to pick its fights and also heal itself.  
---
As for professions, two gathering would be your choice not to get deep into recipes.  
---
And, well, no class/profession can prevent you from taking horrifying decisions.
---
It is not. For pre mades having paladins on your side is prefered vs having to face undead.
---
In world pvp the undead can be a bit of a bummer but you got to account that wotf is on a long as CD. You still have Deathcoil, CoEx and engineering tools of other consumes. Don't let UD prevent you from playing the faction you want.
---
I think the most important part of tanking 5 mans is the pull. If you pull packs properly the fight will go smooth. Always mark a skull before you pull, and CC markers if you need them. Pull with your range weapon, then cast bloodrage and battle shout on your party. Gaining rage and buffing with battle shout generates aoe threat. Make sure your dps waits for the skull to reach you before starting dps.
---
Amen
---
Battle Shout doing more threat than Demoralizing Shout is an actual Classic thing, right?  Not just a private server quirk like the Fury /sit macro thing?
---
(Just so we are clear, I'm not saying this means anything - it's just interesting to me)
---
Can someone help me understand the warlock epic mount quest?  In which patch was this quest introduced?
---
I assume since it requires a dire maul run that it will not be available until a while after classic launches.
---
If this is the case... what will follow warlocks be doing epic mount-wise?  AV mount? Waiting for dire maul patch to drop?
---
Nemesis &gt; All
---
Idk I think they’re more West honestly 
---
While having a job and family will hinder your chance at raiding but you will get to do it,by the time ZG comes out guilds are clearing MC and BWL in less than an hour and a half for both. 
---
While you won't be joining any of these guilds as you won't have the time that they put in to achieve this they do/will pug MC and BWL come AQ as Alts/Offtanks want TF and hammer of rag and the guild still needs the recipes and often complete this in less than an hour as a majority of the guild still participate in this.
---
As someone who has healed on Pservers in these guilds as a Pally and druid, And would steal my Partners priest back in vanilla to mess around on i think you should go towards the priest. Now it is entirely up to you which you play however the priest will require less effort and time to get gear,Easier to heal and easier to play ( You will still be able to heal what you want as Shadow) so you will have an easier time achieving your goals in what little time you have, Not to mention if you roll Dwarf for fear Ward ( As you mentioned you we're going Alliance ) you will have an easier time getting into these pugs as a Dwarf even with slightly underpar gear and as shadow.
---
As for a Hybrid druid you will and can be a monster in world PvP, and they are stupidly easy to level. However you will find a much harder time finding groups for the things you wish to do as your hybridspec will under perform in healing and tanking and most people while shy away from a dps druid compared to something like a Fury warrior,Mage or rogue.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvb8MwvsD4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCvb8MwvsD4) Just mute the Music lol, But this is what a Hybrid druid can do in the world with engi to give you an idea of what you can do in world PvP.
---
Now as for levelling, You will have an issue healing as a group at lower levels this is true. But tanking on the other hand in many ways is better than warriors early on and you will be able to form your own groups and be begged to tank many others.
---
Something along [these] (https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IA0bVRbkAZZxx0tr0z) lines is what you're looking at for a Destruction warlock. Rush Nightfall then go into Destruction for ruin, pumping crit and shadow damage for some PHAT shadow bolt crits.
---
It should be noted that we are ALL a vocal minority. Classic is a niche game and MMORPGs are a dead, segmented genre.
---
There will be an influx of new players when classic launches (retail players who stick with it and truly new players), but there’s no indication that it’ll be a major wave of millions returning to Azeroth. Blizzard doesn’t appear to be advertising this much, especially being 8-12 weeks from launch. 
---
With that, if you create two games for the people to choose from, they will be split. Many millions of players did high-end content in TBC because it was more streamlined and available than Vanilla. Their nostalgia lies in Kara and Gruul. That’s fine.
---
The problem is that if you split a niche audience, you wind up with two, smaller niche audiences. Both games will have significantly reduced player bases because both expansions exist at once.
---
If TBC gets a release, so will Wrath. That compounds the above issue.
---
OP, don't listen to him. He just wants to be the only DK on the server so he can get the first Shadowmourne himself.
---
You’re projecting 
---
Substantially, pets die very easily on most encounters, lack of ruin gets worse and worse as time progresses, lack of range is also terrible and you end up losing lots of dps.moving out of crap
---
I hear vanilla alliance shamans have never lost a fight. 
---
Which is my entire point. They're coming to classic and saying "that's nice.. but what we really want is this." 
---
It's a slap to people who have been made to play private servers for classic for years before blizzard told us we didn't want classic, we just thought we did. 
---
All those notions on your phone... Clear them D:
---
Imagine if there were more people playing classic than retail. What do you think Blizzard would do? (Legit question)
---
This is great! Helps deciding what race to play 
---
Or soul link affliction lock.

1. Open World 
---
1. With LOS: Mage, Hunter, Druid
---
2. Without LOS: Druid, the reigning queen of pillar humping for 15 years
---
3. Small (3-5): Standard WSG premade mid classes / Mage, Paladin, Warrior, Priest, Shaman
---
4. Large (10+): Mage

3. Duels against other classes: Anyone capable of resist stacking and healing, attrition fighting / Paladin, Warlock, Druid

I remember using dampen magic when farming air elementals in Silithus during AQ event. They only did elemental damage so with dampen magic on they hit you for 1 damage.
---
I've been fantasizing about Rogue for years just because of videos like World of Roguecraft, Grim, Bring the Shadow etc. But now that I think about it more, I might not enjoy the stealth playstyle that much. I'm torn between Rogue-Hunter-Mage. All my friends have quitted video games, so I will be solo. Any suggestions?
---
Pserver players clear AQ40 in first week of release.
---
You sir, are a ret paladin. 
---
Whatever you're good at. You can outplay anyone in most situations. Especially if youre engi/alch.
---
It's honestly not that bad, you just have to put a little bit more effort in and remember to adjust your CC depending on your matchup. Stuns aren't so great against Orcs but they're preferable against Forsaken, consider bringing Succubus against Forsaken so you have more CC than their racial + trinket can deal with.
---
Idk about that man, they seem more like South to me
---
Hi, /u/JHoneyBadgerS
---
Leveling on a hunter is disgusting compared to the other classes. It feels like your playing a different game its so easy. 
---
I sincerely hope Blizzard reconsider the baffling decision that they've made - based on the surveys there is plenty of interest in an RP-PvP server, surveys done far before this absurd announcement.
---
I for one was absolutely looking forward to rolling on an RP-PvP server and won't play unless they make one at launch.
---
If I roll a character on another server, wait months for them to ??then decide??? And maybe release one?? Then reroll? Sounds absurd.
---
I can't answer that, didn't play warrior in Vanilla and I'm not sure if there is detailed threat info from back then, but I don't see why it wouldn't be.

really detailed guide with threat section 
---
Please stop all the middle ground/comprise posts.  If blizz is going to put in loot trading we can't stop them but lets stand united that its not what we want and hope they listen.
---
The major con is dealing with the fact that every moron and ten year old will pick the same class and ruin its reputation. Other than that, and low dps in raids, hunters are generally good at everything they are meant to do, including cc. 
---
Time to learn how to tank
---
Yes please, and T2.5 !  
---
Play a Bard.
---
Thanks I have been looking there as well
---
I assume googling mini micro atx will give me some ideas where to start ?
---
That's what I'm looking forward to. *REALLY* tanking. 
---
It will indeed be until phase 2 that we can get our fire pony with the release of DM.  
---
Either you wait until phase 2 for you epic mount or you get it the "normal" way via training and buying.  
---
Lil trivia as the fire pony is a spell it can also lock you out of the shadow school if you get interrupted, it interupts the 5 second rule for mana regen aswell as costing you a lil bit of mana. These are all negatives a normal epic mount doesn't have.
---
I'm not trying to be dramatic here, just going to honestly answer.
---
If there is no RPPvP server at launch I won't play Classic. I already have a T2+ geared character on a pvp private server, a great guild, and lots of friends.
---
I played on an RP server during Retail Vanilla and the only reason I wanted to roll on Classic was for an RP server.
---
If there is no RPPvP server I have no reason to reroll.
---
The whole "we will release one if there is interest after launch" argument is absurd. What does that even mean? A lot of people roll on PvP servers? A lot of people roll on RPPvE servers?
---
Then what? They make a new server one month in? What happens, people reroll? Absurd.
---
The smart thing to do would be to *release with at least one RPPvP server* and *increase their numbers* if it gets full, or eventually *merge it with a PvP server* if it remains low population.
---
That would have been the right thing to do.
---
EvERy SPeC WaS vIABlE sOmEWHErE
---
so it was YOU!!
---
You didn’t mention prot Paladin :(
---
It's an absolute deal breaker for me. Not trying to be dramatic, but I won't play Classic if there is no RPPvP at launch.
---
Rerolling after X months of playing is not an option for me.
---
Username checks out.
---
According to samsung.com, your TV has 3 hdmi ports. If you don't know much about computers, so to best buy, ask one of the sales associates about the computers.
---
You want to specifically ask about: 8gigs of ram, an hdmi port, i3 or i5 processor, around 500gig hard drive, a DEDICATED video card, and preferably a dedicated audio card.
---
Tell them you want to spend about $400, and they should show you something. If not, ask if they have something a little more than 400, but still has all those things. Video card is one of the biggest, as any spell effects in a big group will absolutely destroy your frame rate otherwise.
---
Yeah but the rep grind is a drop in the ocean compared to the honor grind. Normalizing honor is a better way to get people to slow down long term instead of zerg rushing the games.
---
My priest was biblebasher for like 6 months before I got a mandatory name change
---
Does anyone know if there's a full gear planner available anywhere, including adding non-visible items like neck, rings and trinkets?
---
I like to fiddle around with different sets for twinks and such for fun and planning.
---
Good job man! I was actually looking for the mogmygearwebsite today and found that it’s been shutdown. Your website works great and I got exactly what I wanted. Tauren hunter tier sets :)
---
It would mean the revival of real MMOS again. 
---
They would realize they are morons for milking wow for so long and running it into the ground creating a brain dead fan base. Finally create a star craft universe MMO just like classic wow and become a successful company again. 
---
My favorite was always &lt;Intense Intents In Tents&gt;
---
Can you say more about how often you'll be playing and how many hours? Will you play every day or only weekends etc? :) 
---
No RPPvP server at launch absolutely kills my entire desire to play Classic.
---
There is no way I'd play for months(?) just to reroll "if" they release an RPPvP server.
---
Extremely disappointing. We were **loud** about content release schedules and they changed the content buckets extremely nicely to the way the community *knew* was right.
---
I really hope that people have their voices heard and they make *just one* NA RPPvP server, at least.
---
This whole thing makes my stomach turn. I really hope they hear us out and do the right thing.
---
Release RPPvP server at launch.
---
make it 39 and rule STV
---
If you're a casual player, the only thing that matters is what you find most enjoyable. If you like picking herbs and making potions, do that. If you want to be a smith, that's fine too.
---
The only thing I'll say is that if you want to play casually solo, you might want to think about a class that has an easy time doing stuff by themselves. So not a warrior.
---
Or roleplay a hunter in stv like me pretending its Vietnam. The air support never comes.
---
I was 9 questing there with my paladin. Very flavorful and easy as hell as pally. I was desensitized by call of duty anyway
---
Depending in what your goals are.  
---
For PvE people need to go into destro to pick up ruin aswell as some other core dps talents like ISB, Bane, Devastation ans Destructive Reach. These however are all not really focused around "fire" spells but rather spamming shadowbolt.  
---
For example:    
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IE0bhRbkAZZgx0tM0z](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IE0bhRbkAZZgx0tM0z)  (SM/Ruin, 30/0/21)

---
For PvP there are popular build that go deep into destro to pick up conflag for burst. In PvP Searing pain is also used way more due to its faster cast time and if you get locked out of your fire school its not as bad as getting locked out of your shadow school.  
---
For example:  
---

You can't expect people on a forum to ***read***, silly person.
---
Or just level a rogue and if you don't like it then stop
---
I'm not saying this means anything but it definitely means bfa is dying and classic &gt; retail
---
Please Soka help this sad Gnome, this Darkspear refugee, this Tauren traveller, this Night Elf priest.
---
No RPPvP at launch completely kills my Classic WoW hype. I've completely stopped reading guides / thinking about it because if there's no RPPvP at launch, I won't reroll onto a Classic server :(
---
To few shadowpriests
---
Lol how is this always forgotten? Blizzard set this system up, we have to be vocal to see anything of value come out of them.
---
That combination will require an alt for farming tho, just fyi @op
---
Or you can buy it. Prices were cheap in classic until naxx, black lotus was expensive for a reason though.
---
A friend of mine who knew my login accidentally leveled up my twink. I didn't really mind him logging in and fooling around a bit, but logging in to a level 20 character felt bad man. This was in tbc though I think 
---
Makes me remember how leveling took enough time to make parking your level 60 nearby worth it. Nowadays it hardly makes sense since you don't even need the zones to level.
---
Did they always move in tens?
---
Plus side, doesn't take a bag spot.
---
I played on Lightninghoof back in the day, which was an RP-PvP server. I don't think I RP'ed much, but I did RP a few times. I like the option to have like-minded people to be able to do it if I do want it. Not to mention, it's kind of always fun to walk around and stumble upon a group open RP'ing and seeing what they say. Also, people tend to say RP servers have nicer people overall, which I'm not sure is true or not (it's still the interwebz), but that's the theory that goes.
---
We're not sure that any addons will work for classic by the time it comes out.
---
The old classic addons were based on an old API, and they're turning off certain features to bring it back to vanilla-ish for classic, so new addons probably won't work either.
---
New addons will have to be made, sometime between alpha/beta and release, so any addons that will exist will likely be buggy or just not made yet.
---
The disparity grows when you use the full name for BFA, I thought that was interesting also
---
A ret paladin is a great offtank for adds in ZG and MC, brings another blessing and have very good aoe dmg. Can also heal on bosses. Play it as a hybrid and it's a GREAT spec.
---
Ench and boomkin are pretty much "for fun" in raids and PvP specs. But vanilla raiding content is easy enough to let people play specs they want.
---
We will see and if Blizzard is clever will ask community and check comments from them.
---
My opinion is, stay in Classic add content post Naxx, it could be 5Man 10Man or new raid 20-40, at the end they have a lot of stuff like Demons, Old Gods or new factions.
---
Ahh yeah, back when 19 was a few days work, feelsbadman
---
There is a kill condition when a player is lvl 60 and the other play is lvl 15. 
---
So no, this is not bullshit. This 100% existed on the PVP server I played on in vanilla (mug’thol).
---
Twisting-Nether EU checking in
---
No, I'm the kind of person who isnt cool enough to get ingame mail haha
---
hope they change their minds on this, a lot of people want RP-PVP :(
---
That is probably because people who play wow already search BFA and people who are interested in playing it but doesnt search Battle For Azeroth. 
---
Thanks and well done.
---
Yes pls. It's so lame when a 2nd rate premade on your faction just queue dodges horde premades all day because they can't beat them. Queue dodging is pure cancer and should 100% be a bannable offense.
---
It's not, you deal with it, until you later play a horde warlock and realize what an uphill battle it actually was.
---
Of course I don't think that on pservers the population balance is skewed undead as badly as it was originally, so it may be more tolerable.  There were soooooooo maaaaannny undead rogues in the day. Now it seems like orc is regarded as optimal.
---
It would change the direction of WoW going forward I'd say AND TBC severs maybe?  I'd dig that
---
I don't see them adding one in. and yes, most pserver people already know where a lot of spawns are and routes and even now are testing these to speed level.
---
that being said current pserver add-ons won't work in the new client. so a new set of quest help add-ons will need to be built. I assume as well twitch will have a section for add-ons in their client like they do now for bfa.
---
your average wow player, from mythic raider to casual player, all are aware of add-ons. if they see questing is not something they enjoy without an add on (some people really enjoy the exploration and discovery of questing with no help in vanilla) they can go get the same "popular" add-ons from whatever category.
---
*if* we get a beta for wow classic, I am sure people will start add on development almost immediately and there will be a large supply at launch, if just ported add-ons from live.  if not then chances are no one will be using add-ons early game or for awhile anyway.
---
only time will tell on add-ons at this point but for your question no I don't think they will add it into the base game UI
---
That is true aswell and with hoisting all them soulshards around that precious bag space is well precious :p
---
Dude how are you this daft? They aren’t changing items. They are time gating them. With AV it would literally be reconstructing a version of AV they don’t have data of. It is far more than just adding or removing npcs. It would be a different patch version data of AV.
---
Stop being so obtuse about things. There is a difference between time gating things like raids and items versus using different versions of things, especially since....let me say this again...THEY DO NOT HAVE THE DATA FOR ANY PATCH PRIOR TO 1.12.
---
Quit blindly defending these gaming companies. The hail corporate agenda here is fucking old. So quit getting upset when people voice their concerns when they will have to pay a subscription to play obsolete content. You are the problem.
---
Mini ITX is the smallest mobo form factor you can get. I think he recommended that or the Micro ATX (inbetween ITX and a full blown ATX Tower) because it would sort of be a console unit in your living room being connected to your tv. So it would look a little nicer. If you go this route you have to be sure to coordinate the graphics card size/cpu cooler size/RAM height etc. for all to fit since Mini ITX cases can vary so much from one another.
---
Enhance? You mean resto with 2h from enhance because windfury was enough. Boomkin? Waste of innervate on yourself. 
---
"Ret" in vanilla was reckoning prot holy. Cmon man.
---
Them stockade pauldrons. 
---
Lovely
---
Might be cheap, but if you're only objective is to play pvp you won't have a lot of gold on hand. 
---
I don't think ion should be directing classic... Should be one of the old team. Personal preference I wanted to voice. 
---
I tried to level an alt on a RP french server back in the day (Kirin Tor I think)  it was quite awful: main chat (for low level and IF) was mostly group A and B insulting each other and most of the players didn't bother to RP at all and most of those who tried were cliche characters who were orphaned because the opposite faction killed their family and took an oath to kill everyone and/or elf prostitutes.
---
I'm sure some people had a great time and were able to find great group or guilds but for me it was more than disappointing.
---
There's Questie and Vanilla Helper which together give you a pretty good addon driven solution.  Personally I don't think they should go full on with it, but at least being able to see available, unavailable, and low level quests on the map or minimap native I think will solve a lot.  
---
Less often is needing to know WHAT to do (we do have wowhead afterall) is knowing what CAN be done.
---
Well, that went south pretty fast.
---
Rogue T2 &gt; all
---
You certainly won't be playing the game long then, if you're only after pvp, because you'll need raid equipment to remain viable and you should expect to spend about 30g per raid, if you're not on top of your game.
---
This, there is one solution that suits everyone.  All looting is final, if you can learn to master BWL and Naxx or get Rank 10 you should be able to learn how to LOOT A GOD DAMN ITEM.  
---
Blizzard needs to do nothing, the players self police shady looting and no harm is done to the original concept of vanilla.
---
No. Adjusting the game to the lowest common denominator is part of what ruined WoW for a lot of us. I *hate* the handholding in the current game, especially in the leveling zones. If people can't figure out addons or basic reading comprehension that's on them. 
---
I'm not saying that to be mean but Vanilla was about exploration and adventure and going off on your own in a strange land, not having your hand held and your dick stroked everywhere you go. 
---
Fuck your nostalgia 1.12av bitch. 
---
Onyxia and dragons of nightmare not included.
---
Thats was exactly my thought about the private servers, its successfull and comes at no aditional cost.
---
Thank you!
---
Let's hope crbgs aren't going to be considered until much later in the content phase schema. Servers need time to build an organic community and early crbgs would diminish that greatly. 
---
They weren't added until the end of vanilla, so hopefully blizzard stays true to that.
---
I'd rather see a better system impleme test, such as an altered queue system that let's the lesser faction to bypass the queue, thus acting as a faction balancing feature. Similar to how those popular pservers had, which worked well.
---
The new version (which is the version we will have) is a numbers game. 5 people hit the report button as a good on their friend like you do and he was issued a 48hour automatic ban by the system. This is what I'm worried about. If it were the old system where someone reviews it I wouldn't be worried at all but that's not blizzard anymore. 
---
Nah, but they liked to ask people of they wanted to go camping with them 
---
I'm not planning on playing like that, but I think you overestimate the average casual player. They don't care about stuff like that. 
---
as someone who probably contributed to this trend graph. I know I play bfa and play to play both when classic launches.
---
but I don't really search for live I just go straight to mmoc, icy veins, or wowhead so there would be not bfa searches from me. but since classic information is limited I Google around more to see other articles and such on the topic.
---
I also want to stay classic. Dont want TBC or Wotlk (still i think those 2 were the best wow expansions).  
---
i just think its risky to add content to classic because it will change the game and people dont want that.
---
I don't see how this is an RP-PvP server issue. Those who are 100% RP or 100% PvP might find issues, but the problem is ultimately the inability to accept how others choose to play.   
---
I started on an RP server (Scarlet Crusade) as a gnome warlock, and the Gadgetzan Gazette rings a few bells. I then made an orc shaman on Twisting Nether (RP-PvP) and while my memory is not 100% accurate, the game was fine on both.   
---
That said, I wasn't interested in forum drama whatsoever back then; I'm still not, but tend to at least read that kind of stuff a bit.   
---
A-holes and people who can't speak properly exist in the real world, so if I cared to be in character, it was light-RP and I didn't try controlling how others spoke or acted...unless they were in my group.   
---
Ultimately, I don't see any issues outside the norm. 
---
Oh, that's why our paladin did decent enough damage all the way up to Naxx with retri PvP spec (he had repentence, so had to go deep in retri).
---
Because some specs were more popular or optimal doesn't mean they're complete waste. Stop being an elitist jerk that can't see more than 1 feet from your eye. Having fun and downing the bosses is the goal. Most specs can do that even if it's way off optimal.
---
You're gonna tell me Retri was useless in TBC was well, right? If so, you're doing it to the wrong person :)
---
They will once their r13 gear is smacked off of them by someone who goes to raidnight twice a week.
---
I mean it was more the effort of getting all the gear without accidentally leveling up. Like getting the sword from SFK by having someone clear everything but the boss while I sat outside, etc. I think it took a few attempts to get a decent set of gear without hitting level 20.
---
It was. I started playing just a few weeks/months before BC and I remember being able to walljump for a long ass time. My favorite was jumping up the big tree on the right side of alliance base in warsong, you were untouchable as a flag carrier. Ofc, at some point the little shit that was me was reported and a GM just suddenly appeared infront of me, saying "Never let us catch you again (translated)" and disappeared again. I never fucked with exploits who affect others again after that, but of course I still walljumped for fun whenever I could.
---
If you were alliance it was. Seal of blood or get back into holy.
---
I haven't been on this sub long at all, and while I don't think RP-PvP server are more mature, I'd definitely say they were more chill..at least back in the day. Then again, I only played on one of them, so I can't say for sure.   
---
It might be due to the hardcore PvPers going full PvP and the hardcore RPers going RP, but again...can't say for sure. 
---
All I know, is that the one RP-PvP server I played on was by far my favorite. 
---
Honestly I find the 29 bracket to be much more fun and balanced.  You actually get a real mix of classes as more talents and abilities open up after 20.  The 19 bracket is dominated by hunters and rogues, its like 8/10 players on both sides of WSG.  There are many other benefits to going 10 levels higher, it allows you to gank in Lakeshire/Tarren Mill as well as use more consumable.  There are also noticeably fewer twinks in this bracket making it easier to dominate games.
---
I realized this yesterday. The unbearable anticipation for WoW is part of the vanilla experience. Embrace it. Appreciate it. This may be the last time you'll get to feel like you want to pull your hair out because you just can't wait log in to Vanilla/Classic.
---
Not while I'm there.  &gt;:)
---
Classic guild MT here. Never played private, but remember some things. 
---
- You will always have insufficient amount of rage, so you will need to spent it smart;
---
- Damage != Aggro. Sunder strike gives more aggro, so you go for it on every target, and usually cycle it between a focus target and all others to not lose aoe aggro;
---
- 5ppl doable without prot tallents because if you go not higher than 2 levels above you, you wont be affected by crushing blows, so it will be easy tankable;
---
- You will need prot tallents only for raid to prevent crushing blows from a bosses. Google for hit cap and anti-crush cap. Hit cap is 5% and crushing i believe is around 102.4%. thats a main things for tank;
---
- While tanking dungeons , try yo have a first hit cap (around 3%) to prevent parry. Because if mob parry your attack, it will counter attack with (around) +40% of attack speed or instank attack (don't remember);
---
- Focus on hit cap&gt;armor&gt;hp before raids and for fast weapon. Fast weapon will give early rage; 
---
- If you will find a priest healer, ask him to not shield you on a start of encounter. If mob hits a shield it wont give you rage;
---
- go for parry while leveling, it will increase your tanking capabilities;
---
- If you want to tank in raids, than go only warrior. If 5ppl is enough, you can go druid or pally. If you are skilled enough, you can be off tank as pally or druid, but druid is better because he can do dps while waiting for his shift, and feral has +3% crit buff for his party while bear/cat;
---
I think people are worried they are going to fuck this up. Then it's back to private servers.
---
Im in the point that i dont care what they do, just release the game. Cash shop, what ever. Naxx at start, fine. Instant level 60, why the fuck not.
---
Maybe I'm optimistic but I think there's a good chance they'll offer up one RPPvP server per region before launch once they see how many people are interested.
---
Yeah some fair points, I agree with most of them apart from the Lakeshire part - there's no challenge in killing people 10 levels lower, at least with twinks you come up against other twinks 
---
That's where I played back in Vanilla! In a guild called The Orphans Grim. Great bunch of people, and a great RP realm.
---
It's also wrong in some pretty obvious places.
---
[Chimeric Gloves](https://classicdb.ch/?item=15074) instead of [Stonebark Gauntlets](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18344) listed as NR BiS, is just one example of many.
---
As a casual you likely won't be leveling alts to 60 so just pick the class you enjoy most and rock it. Herb/Alch is a good choice omce you're at 60 if you want to farm your own raid mats, maybe herb skinning while leveling, but if you don't expect to hit 60 any time soon then I'd say just pick some combo you think would be fun and see what comes of it. Without the need to raid, something like mining eng might be cool for fun trinkets and wpvp consumables.
---
Did you ever hear about how they were originally planning to make the zone darker so that you couldn’t see more than a couple feet ahead of you? That woulda made it 1000x scarier
---
Sir I believe you may be lost.
---
This is a reddit forum about a blizzard game 
---
The primary reason Ion has a job is because he understood Classic mechanics better than his peers and Blizzard saw how bright he was.
---
To his credit: he’s not ‘the voice’ of the old team, but he’s a direct descendent of them; a hand-picked choice to lead WoW. BfA’s wonky lottery design isn’t his fault, but the next expansion will be 
---
lakeshire Q start around lvl 16 and most players will be lvl 24-26 before they leave the zone for good, plenty of rich pickings for honor even if you leave the honor-less targets alone.  Even a couple of you there can actually create some great pvp if you hang out in the Keep where alliance need to kill mobs for the Stockades pre-Quest.  These will generally be in groups of 4/5 and all in the mid 20's. 
---
Agreed. I hope they're not doing this to encourage paying for server transfers to it once they come out...but maybe my skepticism of Blizzard is too high here.   
---
I loved my UD priest but after reading people talk about shadow priest and trolls... I will be rolling troll priest this time around. For shadow guard and the healing debuff you can spam .... I was so overly enticed by Devouring plague and WOTF originally back in the day. Now looking at knowing more ... troll &gt; UD when it comes to priest.
---
Man, I fucking hate streamers and the crowd they bring.
---
Add PvP sets and it will be worth a gold, dude.
---
Nah i know a few people who are just gonna level up slowly and when they hit 60 they'll do a dungeon every few weeks and a bg here and there. Lots of people play this game very casually, but those people usually don't go on subreddits etc. so you don't really hear from them. 
---
the 29 hunter is better for hillsbrad
---
NE with stealth cat
---
camp the fields protect the ally humans. Be the boss of Hillsbrad fields.
---
I like it... I imagine there would be some loopholes but it would just be a matter of closing them
---
Im kinda go for the same thing, first points in holy so y get concentration for some AoE tanking (lvl 20). Then in the prot tree till y get holy shield (lvl 51). then some more in holy so you can heal aswell (lvl 60). Then y get the following build. [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxuzxZVGtIMzxo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxuzxZVGtIMzxo)
---
With this build y can heal almost as good as a raid healer, you only miss 5% crit. You can AoE grind mobs and tank dungeons all the way up to UBRS. And y got some pvp talents that makes you good at healing with a 2hander for some reckbombs once in a while. No respec cost and a free mount so you will swim in money :D.

“I treat the heads of the horde like I treat my specimens. I CRACK THEM OPEN WITH A HAMMER”
---
In all my time playing games in general RP servers always have the best communities because the people put in more effort to make the game enjoyable. I’ve done this with WoW, ARK, Wildstar, and some others. It really makes a huge difference and I love to RP with people who are also into it. 
---
I’ve told this story before but here we go.
---
A guy I knew temporarily broke off from his guild to make a guild called &lt;White Dragon Supremicists&gt;. A bunch of people joined his guild on alts and what have you. Everyone in the guild wore the white low level robes and either had a white face mask or white hood. They also equipped low level farm tools and put a fiery enchant on them.
---
For a very, very brief period of time, they did a walking follow Congo line and complained about how there were no white dragons in WoW, how Black Dragons were getting all the spotlight, and how Blizzard should add white dragons into the game as they were the strongest and purest race of dragons.
---
Needless to say, the leader of the guild got fucking nuked from orbit with a week ban and I believe the other guild members got 3 days.
---
Just remember, some memes should stay dreams
---
Okay that sounds pretty cool
---
assassins blade? I remember it being very rare and really expensive
---
my twinks had to use something else lol
---
This is part of vanilla experience, go on adventure to find stuff, solve problems, get phatt loot. Do you want to take that part of fun away? Even while having /1 general to ask about mankirk's wife?
---
There was a great Horde rogue guild there, really nice people as well.
---
Battleshout gives aoe threat per applied buff to your party memebers, so if you have ranged ppl staying near max range of dps/healing, demoshout can be better threat / target. But if your party is close enough, battleshout is superior.
---
I'm so dissapointes you didn't make a bone pun/meme.
---
However, now I really think I want to call my guild the bone zone
---
Damn that sucks.
---
Do you have one that works better? I might just go through and make a list myself for hunters
---
o yeah you can kill them all during the elite pull
---
When I played WoW for the first time back in 2006, I was forced to Play on a RP-PvP sever due to the friend who brought me into game playing on it. In Classic I will enjoy a simple PvE Server without getting ganked and forced RP.

Judgment and Bloodfang. A+ sets to this day.

I'm looking forward to the grind :)

Where do you think their elbows went

Monday, tues wed 2-4 hours

Friday night till when ever

Saturday 4-6 hours

That's if Blizzard had any game designers still employed. They can't deliver games anymore, they only make addiction machines. 
---
It's not impossible of course, but it'd be easier to just scrap the company and start from scratch. The culture's going so far down the toilet there's not much left to salvage. 
---
I played Horde, but I talked a lot with 2 Alliance "colleages" playing ret pally in high end guilds as well and they did quite fine without BoS.
---
But thanks, now I know you're trolling and just talk about stuff you don't know anything about :)

---
Personally I hate the 19 twink bracket.
---
It's pretty much the exact opposite of what you claim. Most classes lack their core abilities and everything is just an auto-attack/wand fest. There's almost no outplay potential, and even engineering is severely limited.
---
It's entirely your prerogative to play what you like, but personally the 19 bracket bores me to tears. 
---
49 is where it's at, for me. 
---
* Everyone has their core kit, making for much higher class variety.
---
* Everyone has a mount, so classes with speed boosts like Hunter, Druid and Shaman aren't laughably overpowered.
---
* Getting BiS gear requires some dedication, but is very doable with friends/guildies help. 
---
* Due to the higher level, enchants play a smaller role in character power. Meaning non-twinks can actually stand a chance.
---
* Much higher skill-cap due to the greater number of abilities and tools available.
---
a mix of herb mining skinning and enchanting ( lv1 just for disenchanting items for the materials to sell)
---
so no crafting
---
casual classes: druid, paladin, mage.
---
Entitlement? This is standard individual uncoerced interest - the absolute bedrock of capitalism and democracy.
---
A customer, the buyer is saying "I would like this" and you are saying "just let the corporation do what they want."
---
So again you show a complete fundamental ignorance and disregard for people and you also get a *fuck you*.
---
*cries in warrior*
---
19 is absolute bush tier, go make a 39 like a real man.
---
As a mage, who is one of the stronger classes against rogues, I see it as my sworn duty to slay any rogue I see regardless of level.. Now if I could only find them. 
---
Is that casual? I guess I'm super fucking casual cause I'll be lucky to get an hour in each day.
---
goblin engineering is the one you want to end up with at the end. 
---
You need sappers to max raid DPS and being able to craft them = win
---
Not to mention the rocket boots break while gnomish doesn't. 
---
If you think it has anything to do with both players being druids you are fooling yourself 
---
More and more BfA babies have been crying lately on this sub about wanting QoL changes.

This could get rough as we get closer to release date. Brace for impact bois

I'm not sure all these items will be in during the early days of the server.  
---
Like I'm pretty sure the pattern for Lionheart Helm won't be available before BWL
---
This has been discussed to death already. I played RP during retail Vanilla and here is the main thing for me:
---
If I wear all purple cloth armor in a main city and slow walk around the mailbox, on and RP server people will say "nice clothes" "good day" "are you a tailor sir?"
---
If I wear all purple cloth armor in a main city and slow walk on a non-RP server people will say absolutely nothing, or they will say "wtf r u doign?"
---
I don't remember, but I don't think so. I was never especially rich in WoW except a part in Cata when I got hacked and when Blizzard returned my account I had 30k gold or something. 
---
Part of the fun was rereading the quest log 50 times to figure out where the fuck to go and what to do
---
The lack of Frostfire callouts in this thread irks me
---
Thank you for the effort! This is the type of thing I love 
---
Hunter. Easiest leveling experience, really fun to play, lots of room to play around with talents, pets etc. 
---
If you're not serious about making tons of gold then skinning/leatherworking fits the hunter fantasy really well. Feels great killing a beast, skinning it and then crafting armor from it to wear.
---
I totally get that. World PvP is not for everyone and that’s totally fine. I really enjoy it personally. Even getting ganked was part of the experience for me. When questing in zones that had both horde and alliance hubs I’d always have to be on high alert. Seeing a member of the opposite faction gave me a rush of Adrenalin. I even had some friendly encounters which were pretty funny. I was pretty appalled that blizzard removed world PvP in the current game. 
---
That's a completely disingenuous argument. There are masses of surveys, both internal and external, that Blizzard has access to. There are google metrics and other additional data.
---
Simply releasing a single RPPvP server would have been the right decision.
---
If they "release Classic first, then maybe release RPPvP server" then RPPvP is *dead on arrival.* What are people going to do? Reroll their characters after months of playing? Not going to happen.
---
The actual smart thing to do would be to *release at least one RPPvP server* and simply merge it with a pvp server if it never gets enough population.
---
Just ret
---
Being a Sm/Ruin lock in the tank group for the steam buff, will I never be competitive at dps as a horde lock? I raided MC/BWL on a pserver and remember having to stop casting almost anytime I crit. Makes me wonder if rolling ally would be less of a headache. (That and not a crap ton of pallies dispelling stuff in bg’s)
---
Still mad at blizz for this one ...
---
Well that's a legit strategy for extra bank space. 
---
Hello fellow Ravenholdtanian. I joined late Vanilla and started from scratch @TBC launch on Ravenholdt. What was your name? Azyr - horde, rogue here.
---
On topic, I find the RP servers much better because the population is balanced exactly right, so people actually know each other. Also the names stay way clear of the "XxXxxXPussyMagnetxXXXxZZ11!" stereotype and actually seem semi-realistic.
---
I'll be rolling on the EU-RP-PVP server, hopefully on Ravenholdt if they launch it again. 
---
I haven't seen one for hunters. I have a Mage list that's actually accurate though.
---
then there will be rp realms just not with pvp unless you want to flag yourself, WHICH YOU CAN DO.
---
I'm going to be straight with you. Everyone telling you to play what you want is wrong. You need to be playing priest. If you're going to be casual your time is important, you don't want to be sitting around trying to find groups. You need people to want to play with you. 
---
People have more fun when they're being healed. It doesn't matter how much they like you, everyone will be happy to be healed by you. Everyone knows 6 hunters they're actually friends with and even then they don't want to play with them, why would anyone want to play with a hunter they don't even know? Who is going to suffer through that? 
---
You'll also have an easy time leveling. If someone even thinks about attacking you you will absolutely smash them. It doesn't matter how dumb and or bad you are, you're going to shit on 75% of the player base if you're capable of hitting sw:p and shield on cooldown, that's all it takes. Most people are entirely too shitty to kill you before your dot kills them, it's that simple. 
---
It's the same at first on the ally side too. Once your tank gets better gear, it gets better
---
I went with conflag for aq for the burst, while the sustained dps is lower as searing pain is not usable on many fights it really came in handy on the later bosses. I was not very good but I feel its completely viable and optimal if the raid needs burst more then sustained dmg. You might be able to confirm or deny whatever its as good as i remember it
---

---
Anti-social, anti-semitic, maga, racist and sexist talk in /world is not "internet culture". It's a cancer that has been established and spread on inter-regional p-servers due to a clash of cultures, beliefs, merits and worldviews.
---
I sincerely hope that regional servers will alleviate this problem, especially on rp realms.
---
You seem like an angry person!
---
No, I'm not fooling myself. This happened to me as I leveled to 60, I know other players who this happened to, and there are people who agreed with me in this thread. 
---
It's a consumer saying "I want X, Y, and Z that your company doesn't offer, and I refuse to pay more for it".
---
I read the whole post, and I'm just surprised at how angry you got at people who planned to roll an RP-PVP server and were frustrated/angry at the news that RP-PVP wouldn't be there at launch.
---
May I remind you that the reason any of us are getting to complain about this is because we complained in the first place? Classic would not be happening if the people you are currently chastising for "inappropriate" behavior followed your current advice. Shutting up is NOT how you get an experience that you want from a game developer that has asked several times, explicitly, for everyone's opinion.
---
Can we be happy for once? Of course we can, where have you been? You must've read nothing but the forums and then came onto reddit to complain about forum mentalities like it was a problem here on the subreddit. This subreddit, since the info released at BlizzCon, has been VERY agreeable. In fact, this is the only truly negative post I've seen upvoted to the front.
---
Calm down, and stop reading the forums seriously. It's making you angry
---
wewlad
---
really?
---
Isn’t it better right off the bat by the 30% threat reduction via pally buff?
---
To each their own, but if I leveled a toon to 49, I’m just gonna finish leveling them to 60. I understand your points, and they definitely all support a more fun PvP experience, but with the time spent, I’d rather just level to 60 and PvP there (which is probably the best PvP environment).
---
How can you predict if you got matched against a premade? Or do you leave before the BG starts?
---
I'd rather see classic + than TBC.
---
Hobes!  Hey man :) Plan on playing classic? 
---
thats the best case scenario for myself, not guaranteed each week. Some nights i wont be able to turn on the PC.   
---
*the only night that is guaranteed is Friday.* 
---
Hi, /u/Eraser-Head
---
TBC &gt; ALL
---
Fire is not ideal due to its high threat from Searing Pain, plenty of locks especially on Horde side as its harder to get threat mitigation over there allready struggle with threat being the "normal" DS or SM Ruin.   
---
Firelock could be a thing in PvE come AQ and Naxx becaus it frees up 3 debuff slots being SW, ISB and CoS and benefits from the mages debuffs. Threat is however a major issue and even if we ignore threat its still a dps loss over DS or SM ruin. The question becomes if those 3 new debuff slots make up for the dps loss / Threat hassle and so far there is no answer for that.  
---
You can use my gearsheet linked a bit up and if you select firelock it will use searing pain instead of shadowbolts for its calculations and threat is also accounted for in the sheet.
---
It’s also pretty good for making some money early on too, at least my experience on netherwing. Everyone and their brother picks up skinning and tries to sell the skins on the AH for dirt cheap and you can just craft hillmans shoulders for the vendor.
---
I appreciate the honest answer, and i didn't even consider that thought! 
---
Sever
---
I don't mean to throw away the spotlight from pets. But melee hunters can reach higher stats than a pet. A hunter with the right gear/buff is capable of tanking a few raid bosses. 
---
&gt; Let's look at the RPPvP official announcement. All the sudden EVERYONE is an god damn RPer. Fuck off. I appreciate the RPers of the world, and can respect the fact that some might want some open world PvP, but that's such a small percent. Blizzard knows this. 
---
Hear, hear! Screw those people who want RP-PvP servers! That one server will probably be low-pop anyways! /s
---
I think you're so caught up in your own logical hubris that you're forcing contrarian opinions left and right. You have some valid points, but that doesn't mean you need to call EVERYONE out on EVERY issue. 
---
&gt; If I was Ion, I'd slap the fuck out of y'all. 
---
I guess this is why your post is mostly just grand-standing...because you're not Ion.
---
&gt;They aren’t changing items.
---
you don't know exactly what they are and aren't doing, they have not released an exact drop table, you are assuming just as much as I am - we all are until the exact drop tables are released
---
&gt;They are time gating them.
---
to which it is possible to "gate" AV as well - if they wanted to
---
&gt;With AV it would literally be reconstructing a version of AV they don’t have data of. It is far more than just adding or removing npcs. It would be a different patch version data of AV.
---
it would not be complete reconstruction, they could find a middle ground, leave the terrain, add back the npc's - it's a reasonable change - just like color blind mode/or retail wow downpatched/etc - it's a way to get the best/closest to accurate version of vanilla in a timely manner. 
---
&gt;Stop being so obtuse about things
---
you're the one being obtuse, THESE ARE GAME DEVELOPERS, you think adding some npc's and buffing their stats is just too hard to even consider?

---
Its most def easier to get threat mitigation on the Alliance side as you only need a single paladin to buff you, where on the Horde side shamans get prioritised into melee groups and you are the last one to receive it and even then the mitigation is less 30% vs 20% iirc.  
---
Also if you have to buff the tank your not seeing any mitigation ever on the horde side.  
---
Note that your experience could also have been that the tanks simple wasnt doing enough TPS.   
---
[LIPs](https://classicdb.ch/?item=3387) also help a lot and are a locks best friend.
---
Mini and micro ATX/ITX is just motherboard sizes.. I'm guessing you want to either hide it inside a cabinet or something. 
---
There's a ton of channels on YouTube with good guides for building PC's. If you do choose to build your own just be careful of the sizes. Alternatively you could just copy a build.. a quick Google search and I found this https://www.wepc.com/builds/best-gaming-pc-under-1000/
---
&gt; Hunters can pvp quite well in pve spec.
---
what spec exactly?
---
Very well done by them then. There will probably be some ultra-haaardcore guild porting around the world for buffs before raids doing speed-runs in Classic as well, everyone has done the fights 314 times before and can find their position in the room half asleep. But for the vast majority...?
---
To my mind, the experience at 49 is better than it is at 60, for numerous reasons.
---
1. It's vastly easier to get BiS gear and compete.
---
2. That gear isn't so overpowered that you can 1-2 shot another BiS player, unlike endgame raid gear.
---
3. The lack of epic mounts makes flag carrying more balanced, since you're not being chased by people more than twice as fast as you.
---
4. People in the 49 bracket are there for fun, not to grind honour as efficiently as humanly possible to get their epics ASAP. So you don't have to deal with the toxicity of tryhards and can just enjoy yourself.
---
This is BY FAR the biggest mistake in my mind and I’m surprised I don’t see it mentioned more. Blizz established a paradigm where all content is irrelevant except for the latest thing. Modern WoW has an absolutely ludicrous amount of content, probably more than any other game in existence, but there is no reason to do 95%+ of it at any given time. 
---
The even bigger issue is it makes gear feel completely worthless because if you just quit for a month or two and come back you’d get better gear for free. EVERY upgrade in vanilla felt amazing because you had made permanent progress. A gear “reset” would happen every expansion, but that was literally 2-3 years away so gearing up felt worth it and rewarding. Now it feels like the gear you earn becomes easier to earn every few months, so why even play at all? There will always be a psychological gear treadmill, but having it reset every 2-3 months makes you ask why you’re even doing it. A huge part of the RPG genre is that feeling of progress and satisfaction, and I feel like WoW is pretty much completely missing that now. The game is still great, it just isn’t an RPG anymore. It’s a group based action game with minor rpg elements. 
---
Such an egoistical attitude : when you play in a team you're also responsible for the enjoyment of your teammates.
---
It's not about me me me, but about the team. If you don't understand that, play solo or at least don't pretend you care about the team.
---
Um...no.  We should give feedback.  We should be telling a company how we want their product to turn out to best fit our wants and needs.  If you don't want to be a part of that you don't have any requirement to be but dont try to stop others.
---
99% sure Battleshout spam won’t work. 
---
Correct Blizzlike behavior is to only generate aggro if the buff actually applies a buff to a previously unbuffed target. 
---
So spamming it wouldn’t work, as it would just refresh the buff. Bit reapply it.
---
I wonder if every server had a drama filled Scarlet Crusade themed guild. We  had &lt;The Scarlet March&gt; on NA-Maelstrom. I actually joined them for a bit in WotLK, by that time they had chilled out significantly. 
---
Yes, this items sparks joy for many of us.
---
Really, just kill all rogues on sight. If you can see them, they should be dead.
---
Just expect half of us to sprint and vanish (not necessarily in that order).
---
Is that Arcane Intellect?
---
A game coming out 10 weeks is trending more than a game that came out 8 months ago? 
---
Possibly yes, I don't think that would be the case though.
---
If druids didn't have form and remained in their lvl 1-9 state, I couldn't imagine them leveling either :D
---
Warriors have it easy compared to a druid 1-10 !
---
Hnnnng I'm about decided on gnome if I roll rogue. Those tier sets look cool af on gnomes. Also... dwarf doesn't seem as bad as I remembered. Decisions, decisions.
---
I think theres lot of content to add after naxx to stay in vanilla theme. Karazhan, hyjal, arena and caverns of time is full of possibilities
---
Some of us on NA were torn between the lack of RP on our RP-PvP servers, versus the cringe of Moon Guard's reputation. Eventually Wyrmrest Accord sort of became a happy middle-ground. I'm leveling there on retail now that there are no PvP servers on live. 
---
Fair - once AQ opens, the barrier between the people who are geared and the people who are not is definitely gapping. 
---
At the same time, I can’t help but prefer people fighting at max power. It just feels more visceral and fun to me. Just a preference. 
---
As far as twinks go, I prefer 29, maybe 39. I agree, 19 is cornball. If only two classes can come play, it’s not balanced.
---
&gt;If you will find a priest healer, ask him to not &gt;shield you on a start of encounter. If mob hits &gt;a shield it wont give you rage
---
All good tips, this one is really important for people to understand. Your rage generation significantly impacts your potential aggro.
---
I'd also like to throw in Stance Dancing with berserker stance and berserker rage to avoid being feared. Learned it, Love it. Fear is one of classic's most popular mechanics. Since you're horde, you'll have Undead racial to rely on gear and tremor totem with two caveats. The racial is only gonna help once per fight generally, and tremor totem pulses every few seconds, so if the totem pulses before the fear, you'll have to wait a few seconds for it to pulse again, meanwhile the boss runs towards the next unfeared target.
---
Btw I think horde have some real good tank races. Orcs for stun resist. Tauren for how boost, Undead for racial
---
Don't play on a pvp server if you don't want your day ruined 
---
Live to win, Til' ya die...
---
Maelstrom and Emerald Dream, NA, both started out as high pop. Emerald Dream still is. Maelstrom declined (my server) and we've become merged with 2 other RP-PvP servers, we still feel small though.

Are you the Archdruid from the "Archdruid report" by any chance ?

Also people who play or want to play retail wow probably just search "wow" and not "wow bfa".

I think Blizzard just gave me back the most gold they had seen on my characters the last few days to make sure I wasn't robbed, and that the hacker used my account to move gold around. Anyway, to stay sort of on-topic I actually ended up using a lot of that money on a level 1 twink which honestly was way more fun than level 19 twinking ever was. Not possible before you can lock exp though, but  I could beat people upto level 15 and spent some time sniping max level characters who lost duels.

[https://classic.wowhead.com/item=2933/seal-of-wrynn](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=2933/seal-of-wrynn)

If I'm not mistaken Blizzard has made comments alluding to them possibly allowing them to stack because of the fact that it's really not a significant game aspect that has any affect other than inconvenience.
---
I just hope I’m not on your server 
---
It’s ok the guy you’re replying to gets his kicks out of abusing people who have zero chance to defend themselves, I’m sure he finds himself stomping ant piles during the day cackling like a maniac.

Yeah but this defeats the point of my post, which is the time investment 
---
Defeats the point about time investment 
---
Time investment 
---
Balance isn't a true leveliing spec, just a bunch of casting abilities to make it not suck as much. Leveling as Balance is very slow &amp; painful.
---
Anyway, Moonkin form is a 31-point talent so you won't get the +crit buff, added armor or immunity to polymorph until the 40s at the earliest.
---
Just a note, dont use tab targetting. It's random and don't target the mob you most want threat on at the correct time. Just click on them (unless its a huge pack obviously like the bugs in dm : n) 
---
Why do you say such lies?
---
That can be said of any horror / dark game, right? Just a bunch of pixels thrown together. I guess it really dependents on each player's capacity  and will, to immerse themselves in that particular world.  
---
You opened the old wound, my dude. Legendary items in Legion were a very good idea but the drop system and the fact that few of them were overpowered and boring was really bringing the whole thing down. In the end drop system got much better (not perfect though) and what did they do with the whole system in BFA? They fucking tossed it to the trash can. The items with unique passives really added to the character customization and now we're back to dull stat sticks with possible rng to make them bigger stat sticks.
---
Not even a week ago a white supremacist killed 50 muslims at a mosque . And here you are posting a white power meme. 
---
It's really down to personal preference.
---
I've played every bracket extensively, and for me, having the 31 point talent, access to mounts, and almost completely available spell kit makes a huge difference to the quality of the experience.
---
I don't know what your experience is with the different brackets, but if you've not tried 49 and enjoy PvP, I definitely recommend you check it out. Especially if you prefer a class/spec that gets a massive boost thanks to their 31 point talent.
---
Wonder how much he got paid to act like a useless arsehole on tv
---
I would rather level with a warlock or shaman &amp; steamroll stuff. Double Druids are good for travel speed &amp; the ability to stealth.
---
Just classic MM+bm. It works honestly just fine for most pvp encounters and the gear you wear in pve (t1-2) is good for pvp too.
---
No m8, this is totally legit.  Filled in me own backyard.
---
&gt;"Thanks Obama!"
---
No, lets make it 15th and not tell anyone before that.
---
I forget, what stuns do warlocks have access to?
---
As a casual, just play what you like. And add to that a suitable profession. 
---
Warrior/Paladin. I would go for Mining/Blacksmith 
---
Rogue Leatherworker
---
etc. 
---
I would leave engineering and Herb/Alch to the try-hards. Just craft you're own gear. When you level at a slow pace it's not hard to keep your professions up to date. And it's very satisfying to be able to craft a piece of gear that you can wear that is better then what you have.   
---
As much as adult life allows 😁
---
Yeah that's not what I meant. Yes, you do get more threat reduction on alliance, but in the beginning, its still really easy to pull threat on either side 
---
https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_Shout
---
&gt; Before Patch 2.0.1, Battle Shout generated 55 threat for every party member who received the buff. 
---
&gt; However, as of patch 2.0.1, Battle Shout has been 'fixed'. It now generates about 50 threat total[citation needed], no matter how many party members got the buff. The old days of Battle Shout tanking are quite over.
---
Greater Magic wand from Enchanters are better and cheap to get and available from level 13.

[http://classicdb.ch/?item=11288](http://classicdb.ch/?item=11288)
---
You know, i had kinda forgotten (or just not thought about?) the different schools of magic for wands.  I seem to remember when i started in Wrath wondering if my fire damage talents on my warlock increased my wand damage if it was a fire based (or arcane/frost on a mage, etc)
---
Wands were mostly just stat sticks back then, but i do sort of miss them.
---
I am not saying that threat isn't a mechanic warlock have to be carefull about. But 0% threat reduction vs a consistend 30% means you can do 42% more dmg till you pull. It is quit a noticable difference especially in the beginning when tanks are undergeared.
---
Also LIPs are noice aswell as paladin BoP.
---
This was posted last week.
---
Sure, it's easy to gear a 19 twink, if you discount Arena Grand Master. But if the experience of *being* a 19 twink isn't fun, (which I personally don't think it is) then what's the point?
---
Some people love the 19 bracket, and that's fine. This is just my personal opinion on the subject.
---
Sad to hear you have that experience, on Defias Brotherhood people really went all in on the RP most of the times and the toxicity was low.
---
People do know what RP-PvP stands for now as well, so saying it's RP or PvP doesn't really cut it as an argument anymore. But it's still somewhat of a valid point.
---
My experience with RP PvP is GREAT. And what me and many others expected to experience again :/
---
Fart joke!
---
No a game that came out 15 years ago is trending more than a one that came out 8 months go. 
---
That just changed the amount of threat generated. It has nothing to do with the behavior I described. 
---
Before that change it was a solid way to generate aggro, one time, at the start of a pull. After you couldn’t period. 
---
Very different from what I described, which is the fact that reapplying buffs shouldn’t generate threat. 
---
The good old times of crt screens heating up the room to sauna levels, good memories
---
Duskwood was a great zone among many others. The first one I started in was Tirisfal though, walking into the undercity for the first time was awesome.

Felwood always made me feel a bit scared, the music is really fitting.

&gt; Druids do not gank other druids.

and

Guess what, a level 60 alliance warrior ran past me when I was level 30 in Thousand Needles as well. BRB gonna make a thread claiming "warriors do not gank other warriors".
---
As in never ever to have them right ?

I'm just saying if you find WoW dark or creepy you will probably get a seizure from playing the latest installment of Resident Evil. 
---
Have someone with a second account on the other faction who sees when they are in a big already.   
---
I also heard about a way where you can join the bg with one person not in the group and then have them leave or do a partial premade with people not in the same group to make it not seem like a premade or something along those lines. 
---
He's the weird thing..... You know we didn't make WoW, right? What i mean is, at some point you came across Warcraft. Maybe it was Warcraft 1/2/3, WoW (at some point), whenever. Blizzard made those games. Blizzard has done well in the past because of the games they've made, the choices they've made. Its only in recent(ish) years that they've really started to make lots of decisions that cause many of us to stop playing their games. I'd argue they've changed the direction of their IPs and its disappointing. Diablo isn't scary anymore, Starcraft isn't a nuanced Sci-fi political war Drama RTS, and WoW isn't a community driven game.
---
The thing is..... we can't gatekeep Blizzard out of developing their own IP. The idea that we need to hold Blizzard hostage because "Letting blizzard drive is irresponsible" is a strange sentiment. 
---
I'm of the school of thought that Blizzard chose to cater to a part of its community over the years with retail, and by making Classic WoW they're just doing that again (except with a very different part of the community). My vote is that we "let them drive" but are very clear with where we want to go. 
---
I don't know where this idea of "lets tell Blizzard how to do everything" came from, but it seems like its based on the flawed idea of "they're too stupid to make the game the right way, so we need to tell them", where i wholly believe they've just been intentionally making the game for someone else, so to speak. 
---
I mean, look at the leveling in retail. That shit is so messy and broken, with a huge gaps between getting skills, talents are every 15 levels, etc....... I don't actually believe Blizzard CAN'T do better, more that it just isn't a priority.
---
Does that make sense? I'm not being facetious, i'm really asking if im the odd one out here. When you try to create something, a program/game/product, you have people tell you what they want...... but being great at making great things is what makes you stand out (discord vs slack, pepsi vs coke, Marvel VS DC).
---
They haven’t specifically talked about the actual
---
Honor system either have they?  Or will it for sure be the old system?
---
Lesser Magic Wand-&gt;Greater Magic Wand-&gt;Cookies Stirring Rod
---
There is no need for spoon feeding, it is like having all this modern insanely dumb movies and shows with shit plots, you go down a spiral of losing quality more and more a stone goes on.
---
You could have quest spoon feeding but why? Literally why? You are playing a game, not something to rush through, a game with a massive lore and world within in, so enjoy it instead of thinking how to get through it quicker as you will not noice the details of the world, the story and so on 
---
&gt; The old days of Battle Shout tanking are quite over.
---
Notice this part: 
---
Clearly stating that it was used in example gathering nefarius spawn adds in the doorways by spamming battleshout. 1 shout wouldnt do dick...
---
They have too many glaring issues.  I put a lot of thought into where they'd fit and maybe in the duelist category.  They either don't do well in group PvP against actual organized players, or the classes they could beat are able to avoid them completely via super mobility or stealth/prowl.
---
They're easily exploitable with resistance stacking, out ranging mindflay, running them out of mana, and to a lesser degree pillar humping.
---
They do really well against non-attrition classes like Warriors, Rogues, Hunters, even Mages, they crush Druids.  But even then, no one is taking SL locks spot for duelest.
---
So yeah, for me pretty challenging to put them anywhere.  Where would you place them?
---
Sorry I was assuming engineering for bombs, you're right vanilla locks don't have stuns.
---
Sick burn.
---
A lot of people are the ones who have played on "100% blizzlike" private servers fpr years so they think they know what is best for the community. I am one of them but I am going to let blizzard do their game as long as it is true to vanilla thats all i care about.
---
I'm guessing soul-link warlock is the best for defending flags in ab?
---
Unpopular opinion : TBC wasn't that great and it was the beginning of the end for wow.
---
lmao gtfo out of here
---
Open world: Rogue &amp; Druid  
---
\&gt;  the casual/noob would be in a great disadvantage 
---
100% of all players started as a noob...
---
Joana did 1-20 in a bit less than 10 hours I think, so yeah pretty hardcore to lvl it in one night.
---
I realise I'm late and that this might be waaaay out there, but are Enhancement/Resto builds a possibility? I've been thinking about putting together one - [what I have so far] (https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hZxVbdVzutVoez0x) - thoughts? I've been looking for pvp builds that might provide more info but they're proving hard to find. Gearing is also a big question since they don't go together as well as Ele/Resto would.
---
&gt; Give me sharding, dont give me sharding IDC. I just want to play an authentic server again
---
Wait..what? This make zero sense.
---
No.
---
If you want every moment to feel fun then I would not recommend a class that levels mostly by auto-attacking (paladin and warrior). For my part I have fun trying to optimize my leveling experience playing my pally but as I understand here a lot of people seem to find that boring because it's mostly iust auto-attacks.
---
I think a class like druid/hunter/warlock who is more diverse in its mechanics could be more fun each time you log because it feels more "refreshing" but that really depends on how you get your fun from WoW.
---
You could always try reading the quest text like you’re supposed to.
---
What casual would have r13 gear lol?
---
Anything but Protection Warrior.
---
but of course it's entirely up to you. 
---
Do you like greasy green orcs or pink fleshy human? Do you like totems and trolls or short fat dwarfs?
---
Remember that if you pick Horde you can't play a paladin and if you play alliance you can't play a shaman but can play Paladin.
---
Do you like healing your team? Have you picked which side you're on? it's up to you to decide.
---
Mage is probably one of the easiest and deadliest classes to play and would be my top pick, followed by a hunter. But I have already played both, and I am playing a warrior, mage, and a rogue on launch.
---
Dps rotation in pve is better than any other class. Not mono-spell at all.
---
The ones using a guild boost system, which most vanilla servers used to dictate who would be rank 14 when.
---
A PE is often caused by prolonged stasis.  You can love a shitty life and prevent it by getting up during flight paths, waiting for ships/blimps.  Quitting smoking would be a good first step to prolonging playing time and decreasing PE risk if you are worried about that one issue
---
I always thought hunters were easy to play but pretty hard to master....am I wrong?
---
Pick a profession you will USE or actually do. Herbalism/mining requires you to either run around the maps actually gathering stuff OR grinding instances that have herb/mining node spawns in them.
---
If you arent going to grind, herb or mining isnt the moneymaker everyone keeps telling you they are.
---
For VERY casual ppl i would suggest skinning and leatherworking, at early server starts theres TONS of mobs lying just ready to be skinned. You will get max level leatherworking sooo fucking easy. Then make cured leathers on CD (mainly needed in Dire maul patch and later on in naxx). 
---
Later on at max leatherworking, if you dont really go out and kill shit that much, drop skinning and pick up like tailoring for cloth CD's.
---
If you are squishy, pick Herbalism.
---
If you have armor, pick Mining.
---
Yeah. There are a few ways, have a full premade, but split them into groups of 4, where you all queue at the same time, thus lessening the chance to get matched with a premade. Or what most of the 2nd rate premades did, would be to queue as a full 10 or 15man, then only have 1 person enter the BG. That 1 person would then be able to recognize whether or not the opposing team was the premade they were wanting to avoid or not. So then the rest of the team either enters, or declines the queue and then requeues once the first BG is filled with.
---
Same... Couple years from now that will be a fun battle within the Classic community.  Hopefully it doesn't split us up too much
---
Why? They are talking about making changes to retail to make it be more like classic. Let’s be honest retail is never going to be fixed.
---
Days of hot pockets and cheesy snacks making its way out of the rectum of you and your friends in gaseous form. LAN memories!
---
Yeah I think most would say WotLK was. What didn't you like about TBC?
---
OP, might I suggest popping the image into a lightbox / modal or at least opening in a new tab when I click on it? Kind of a weird experience to have it load the image path itself. Otherwise thanks for the tool!
---
Yeah that second option is what I was trying to think of.  
---
Yeah druids dueling is totally useless.  
---
Druid have lot of sustain, can easily runaway and have sleep beast spell.
---
It's a infinite loop.  
---
How about the good old dungarees from the gnomer dungeon quest?
---
http://classicdb.ch/?item=9624
---
I’m gonna be looking to play a Warlock,  I will for sure want to get into raiding.  On Retail the Horde kind of just runs the Raiding scene almost completely,  is their going to be a huge faction imbalance in classic or not?
---
lol so many people scared of the creepy vibe of the zone. places like that are my favourite in games, i love it.
---
I agree, priest is very fun to play even if you are forced to heal by your server:)
---
Would be so sick to have the armorless, og epic mounts, in game and available for the first month after release. But then move on to the armored versions, similar to how it was in retail vanilla.
---
The down votes mean some had it better than others lol
---
They are not talking about classic though. You guys really need to start listening before you get scared and all that
---
they talking about make classic more single when you dont need other people to make everything like elite quests etc , idk if iam wrong , my english is not best haha 
---
Imo Classic&gt;WotLK&gt;TBC&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Rest
---
Maybe Blizzard had the same nightmare than you and will add RP-PVP servers just after the rush so ChadWhateverTV won't pop on RP servers ;-)
---
The actual WTF moment when you understand how much easier your life becomes when you have some spirit gear on your warrior.
---
Well, I am certain it will happen, and Classic will be more popular than retail.
---
What will Blizzard do if this will actually happen? They don't have many options. Trying to somehow implement Classic features in retail is going to backfire, and retail will lose more players. Same with Classic, trying to implement retail features into Classic will led to the same result : losing players.
---
Retail and Classic are TOO FAR APART. It's like vegas and meat eaters. No way you can please any of them unless you provide what each is asking for. A mix of Classic and retail is doomed to fail.
---
Now, what they can realistically do is run 2 MMOs. They said they won't, but they will have to. Retail WoW brings plenty of revenue, because of cash shop and player services, even if the number of subscribers is in the shitter. Retail, with 500k players, will bring in more revenue than Classic, even if Classic will have 3-4 million players.
---
And because of that, Blizzard will run 2 MMOs...for ever. But, since we here don't give a flying fuck on Retail, the question is what will Blizzard do with Classic? Because like it or not, Classic, if more popular than retail, will HAVE TO HAVE a continuation of some sort : TBC, Wrath, Classic post-Naxx content, you name it. It doesn't matter, it will have one, and that one will be the one that Blizzard considers to bring in the most revenue.
---
There is a THIRD option : WoW 2. But this option doesn't exclude permanent Classic servers and retail servers. There will be financial reasons to keep both Classic and Retail, even if there will be a WoW 2. Why? Because that WoW 2 might be a dud.
---
So, what I see in the future (many years from now, at least 5), IF Classic will be the popular WoW choice, is a WoW 2, built on Vanilla game philosophy, while having (for a while at least) both Classic WoW and Retail WoW running.
---
I've recently purchased the HP Omen Gaming Laptop. It's about $800 and it's perfect. I'm very happy with it. Speccs are good, 4K screen so looks good as well. 
---
I can strongly advise the Omen.
---
OR A DWARF
---
What does something like this mean  "	
---
Flameguard Gauntlets (Edgemaster's Handguards (non-human/orc)" 
---
That none-humans or orcs should equip these ? 
---
I’d need to see more video to be 100% certain but I’m pretty sure they are talking about making changes to retail to make it a more social game again.
---
TBC &gt; ALL, if ALL is what came after TBC.
---
Vanilla &gt; ALL. 
---
The part you are quoting is an offhand aside, and wasn’t in the patch note itself. So that doesn’t really mean much. Especially since people in your party *could* have just clicked it off, or used macros to remove it, to allow you to rebuff them. 
---
I’ve heard from several sources that rebuffing should not generate aggro. 
---
Super weak.  I prefer RP-PVP servers to all other types.  Emerald Dream is BAE.
---
Excuses:)
---
This is going to tear my guild apart. Half will want to stick with an RP server and half will want to go to a PvP server, then if you release an RP-PvP server later, no one is going to want to reroll on a new server and many will just quit, since some of their guild are leaving the server for a new one. I feel like I don't even want to play anymore if I can't play on RP-PvP... Another poor decision from Blizzard...
---
A ton of wrong information here. Only first point is correct.
---
In 5 man dungeons you will face mobs and bosses higher then 2 levels above you, it is correct that for them you don't need to be prot.
---
Hit cap is not 5%, it is 8,6% and I have no idea what 102,4% even means. With shield block you will push out crushing chance.
---
There is no first hit cap to prevent parry. 
---
You want a slow weapon unless you are overflowing with rage (like Vael).
---
Don't go for parry while leveling, most items won't have it anyway and you want to maximise dps while leveling. Just have a shield during leveling and a 1 hand weapon you have skill with.
---
&gt;Quit getting upset with every decision Blizzard makes.
---
lol
---
Which is sad, its actually not that hard to fix it.  
---
Just make loot more transparent like in Vanilla TBC etc.  
---
Squish levels and ilvls.  
---
Make so that guilds can take over cities, hubs etc. and needs to constantly work towards keeping it, ofc some bonuses for having small cities or certain disctricts in big cities like Stormwind.
---
yes, for alliance . and thats nearly a mist have due to Salva
---
Point.
---
&gt; I’ve heard from several sources that rebuffing should not generate aggro.
---
Quite different to if it actually did. Vanilla wow wasnt excatly bug free game...
---
To be honest I'd rather have both. Respawn time in Vanilla took forever. The shock we had when we arrived in the Outlands. It was a pleasant surprise even after a wipe due to a massive respawn we thought we could handle.
---
Yea I agree it COULD be done fairly easily. The problem would be is retails player base wouldn’t like the changes. 
---
Why isn't there a single Warlock trainer in Kalimdor? :(
---
It makes Alliance+Warlock+Alchemy/Herb combo super inconvenient.
---
He’s right. Retail WoW can be played entirely a single-player experience and you’ll see 100% of the content. 
---
You can log-in and do solo dailies to get your gold up. If you LFG into dungeons and heroics to get gear, you don’t need to interact with anyone to get to the dungeons or even understand the mechanics. You can LFR and instantly get dropped into a 40 man raid group. There’s no loot distribution involved - the game decides which gear you’ll receive (last I played, it was epic gear randomized like Vanilla greens).
---
Only mythic raiding appears to require interaction, but I can’t speak to that. I got bored before i reached that point.
---
Questing is solo - even the ones that say “suggested group members [3]” can be done by all hybrid DPS specs. Elite monsters can be beaten solo by the worst DPS in the game.
---
PVP, since Vanilla, has always been a single player experience to be fair. You can choose to group up, but you never really need to.
---
Horde and Alliance share AH, so virtually everything that can be sold is on the market. Crafting is mostly pointless and some professions have fallen off in recent expansions.
---
Cause TBC is 10 times better than classic. If you cant acknowledge that then you are up in someone ass so deep :) Or well, you haven't played it.  
---
\--------Numbers say it, experience says it. Wotlk was boosted in subs cause of TBC, just like TBC was boosted by classic. By that, its obvious that TBC is best even when not actually looking at details.
---
\-Classes are actually balanced and VIABLE both in PVP and PVE.
---
\-PvP is way more engaging, way more rewarding, you even have endless time sink with actual progress (Arena) Which doesn't depend on you playing 15hours per day btw.
---
\-PvE is hella better. You even get to do everything on heroic mode(double the content), plus ya know, Illidan. 
---
\-Leveling which is fun af, is no longer boring like on classic.
---
\-Jewelcrafting!?
---
\-Items have way more soul, are actually balanced and useful in most cases. Instead of +7agility + 12 intellect + 3 spirit -3 stamina like we can see on classic.
---
\-You can actually use flying mounts. Many will disagree this is good, as they say it killed world pvp but actually, whole outland is a warzone. Its STV on steroids. Anyone who is blind to that is either a moron or just sits in Shattrath and cries how there is no world pvp. They could make it even better, to fight between reputations in Shattrath or alike. It could have been even better for sure. And thats what Wotlk was supposed to fix, just like TBC fixed original.
---
List goes on and on my friend.
---
But don't get me wrong, Blizzard fucked up with idea of +10 levels. Whoever made that call is the person responsible of wow not having 1billion active subs. It was worst idea ever and I definitely hate it as much as everyone did and still does.
---
If they made everything the same like they did, but kept the level cap and only introduced reputation on hard more or a alike, kept gear progress t1,t2,t3 -&gt;\*outland greens\*-&gt; t4,t5,t6 without outland greens filled in to be better than AQ/naxx gear, but better than classic greens for sure, and balanced the game on that point, id still be playing WoW.
---
Cause TBC fixes classic on so many points: From lore to small mechanics and even item attributes.
---
But, I do hope the guy responsible for "TEN MORE LEVELS" doesn't sleep. It ruined the whole wow future.. Its like a love story my man. TBC gave life to all broken parts of classic. And as a cherry on top instead of 5% better gear by tier, they put a whole container of poop, and they never learned from that :)
---
Imagine if after 10 years of casually playing, you still havent killed both Illidan and Arthas, cause they are still hard, but it doesnt matter, you can stop playing for 2 years and still come back to the same challenge. It would have been ONE BADASS MMO. Unlike now that we have people divided. But for sure, you can see That TBC fixed classic, while WOTLK and every other expansion later ruined the previous one cause of their ideas of divided "PROGRESS". Compared to makeing the whole thing one breathing organism. 
---
But eh, what do I know. Being lvl 175 and oneshotting Ragnaros is way better feel for sure.
---
Paladin tank. It’s the easiest tanking rotation in my opinion. You never have to wait for an instance. Tanks will always be scarce because they don’t have big numbers and are not able to kill a lot of things quick...
---
But for pvp, maybe a hunter or rogue. Though rogue can be painful after the initial attack. 
---
For questing and farming, locks and hunters are great. 
---
Druids are probably best all around but hard to play really well. Though, the tanking rotation ain’t hard, a dot dependent melee DPS is really hard.
---
I like Warriors. They are fun to play, though stance shifting is an awful mechanic, sheesh.
---
Mages. Gawd, I hate mages. They are squishy. It’s the most painful solo questing I’ve ever done. It’s just not me, lol.
---
Thanks for proofreading it, like you and u/Undoer swore up and down you did. 
---
Lore's put on some weight.
---
Maybe we have different definitions about what a casual player is. A lot of people will play a couple of hours in the weekends. That's pretty far from being in a guild going for r14. 
---
We are all going back.
---
If your Paladin did competitive DPS in Naxx, all that says is that the rest of your dps sucked.
---
“Should not” = absolutely did not in Vanilla. 
---
Not “should not” = was not supposed to, but did. 
---
Either way we will know as soon as vanilla is out. 
---
No, because most people looking for retail aren't going to bother putting "BFA" on their search because the default WoW is BFA this is just a stupid circlejerk shitpost.
---
In vanilla I knew quite a few people who pvped on weekends purely to maintain their ranks. It is possible, if we were doing it years ago it can be done now.
---
Most people looking for retail aren't going to bother putting "BFA" on their search because the default WoW is BFA. This is just a stupid circlejerk shitpost.
---
The first days there were absolutely glorious. Everyone was RP-ing in barrens chat even :D
---
But then, logically, RP died off to 10%, but the slightly more mature audience than normal PvP remained, so RP PvP is still better than PvP.
---
Amazing RP meetings tho with hundreds of horde in Gurubashi to decide which alliance city to attack.
---
Point to where I said competitive :)
---
Cool I didn’t know shamans class color used to be pink.
---
Wands seem to me like Verigan's Fist. Most reports for wands I've seen say it takes about 30 minutes of down time through level 8 or 9.
---
BUT, the wands you get speed up 8/9 - 20 a shit ton.
---
Verigan's fist takes about 2 hours of not getting any XP, someone who doesn't is now 2 hours ahead, but the extra damage allows you to catch up by level 28/30, and you're an hour ahead by 34.

Vitalstatistix pls leave
---
They're throwing a temper tantrum over the proposed level squish. "It's just levels" say while also being upset that the change will affect how those levels look. It's funny really.
---
Assuming you mean leveling.
---
Priest+Lock
---
Warrior+Shaman/Priest
---
Mage+Mage
---
We really didnt know shit back then, look at the group composition, rogue without warrior for shout, no windfury in each melee group stack etc.
---
My money is on holy priest demo sac warlock. Infinite mana from tapping with impressive mana regen on the priest, you'll constantly be dealing damage in pve and peeling easily in pvp.
---
Do yourself a favor and buy a PC. I know, a solid laptop would probably work fine for WOW classic, but still those laptops are not really made for (really) long gaming sessions and IMHO it is quite uncomfortable to play on a laptop. You can get a solid PC, even with an 128/256 GB SSD, for much less than 1000€. Also, a PC is much easier to upgrade if you decide to play other, more demanding games.
---
unbalanced faction realms are pretty bad for classic in general.
---
kills off world pvp and instanced pvp will have very long queue times for the dominant faction. Then again the under represented faction usually would have it quite easy to get r14 on and it could be achieved with just 5 hours a day on some realms that weren't very competitive. 
---
It's implied by "Decent enough". That would mean they weren't a burden on the raid. Which is not true for any ret paladin in a competent Naxx group.
---
Thanks for the suggestion will look into this. Was thinking about lightbox on hover already.
---
Easy fix for me is to just not play. First expansion since TBC where I haven’t leveled to max.
---
Believe it or not I actually agree with this. As long as addons are allowed then people will use them including quest helpers. 
---
However, as a compromise to the #nochanges crows maybe instead of a blizzard one blizzard should just provide a link to the most popular quest helper addon, that way they’re not making any changes to the game itself, but still leveling the playing field.
---
No strafe keys set? Having those might make kitting easier as you won't have to do a 180° whenever you turn to shoot. I'm not sure though, barely played hunter.
---
Does this speak to Blizzards greater plan for servers? I would have though at least one for RP-PvP. Maybe they want to use fewer servers and manage players through more sharding.
---
Are we reading the same feedback? Especially with the AV blue post, many people are just voicing their opinion in a totally normal manner. Like [that](https://i.imgur.com/cUzc6t2.png). How is that bitching or moaning? Why should people not give honest feedback and say when they dislike something? Why should people just be happy and grateful? Then you go on and inject your own opinion on sharding, calling everyone a Nostbaby who doesn't agree with you. Honestly your post is garbage. It reads like someone is threatened by the fact that a part of the community wants elements in the game from previous vanilla patches which are more fun to them, but tedious to you. I cannot understand how your post got so many upvotes.
---
Yes, because a Paladin didn't bring shit to a raid in form of buffs, auras, blessings etc :)
---
wheres Mankirk’s wife though?
---
Now link the original one.
---
\&gt;  The experts
---
Having a Twitch account doesn't make you an expert...
---
Undead + Bloodfang &lt;3
---
Don't worry bb you are 100% correct. Listening to forum babies is what ruined WoW in the first place. Anyone who replies here otherwise is likely one of them.
---
Just hope Blizzard sticks to their guns and I will see you during classic when these people start complaining that levelling is too slow rofl
---
It's best to just ignore the youtubers, they know nothing and are just trying to fill time to get their vid to 10 minutes.
---
Its mostly dependent on what class you play. I would say FUCK NO to killing higher level mobs on warrior, but wouldnt blink a eye doing it on a hunter. Melee weapon skills are usually 1-2 (char) levels behind, so even with hit talents you are at a disadvantage.
---
Thats what i figured.  Is there a particular race that warlock benefits from the most?
---
I think the average player just wants queues to pop ASAP. 
---
I’d rather Blizzard wait to see what actually happens to Classic queues before committing to cross-realm. If it’s necessary, then it is what it is, but I wouldn’t want it implemented otherwise.
---
I agree. Player mentality has definitely changed since vanilla WoW and that is a large portion of the equation as well. However, what I'm suggesting is trying to adapt to that new player mentality by incentivising them to play the game the way it was originally played. No one playing defense is a huge problem, and it certainly enables the zerg/rush strategy, although I agree that the NPC nerf was more enabling, but I've already admitted that I don't love 1.12 AV, just trying to find a solution within the proposed version of AV. However, if people were encouraged to play defense via reputation/honor gains etc, then this could help to fight against the new player mentality and the zerg/rush meta. 
---
Awesome work! Would it be possible to add PvP sets?
---
It is, stats might just be in the wrong order + ignore the green. 
---
There's a couple classes that are really great at defending in specific situations.
---
Druid is the best class in the game at spinning the flag (most boring job) and every premade should try to have one.  Druid says at the first cap'ed location, Farm or Stables respectively, and their only job is to stall for as much time as possible until help arrives.  Moonfire every ~9 seconds, travel form around staying out of range.  Enemy starts trying to cap, Moonfire and travel form away... until your team shows up.  You can wait in stealth while defending and also have the option to ninja mine or lumber mill if your team is giving good callouts.  Rogue is also good at this role, but not better assuming equally skilled.
---
Mages and Paladins get honorable mentions for being able to hold a flag long after it should have been lost because of bubble earth and ice blocks.
---
Warlock made the list because for the team defense aspect, they have the most impact (purely subjective and didn't want to paint Druid as battleground superstar).  They have a realistic chance of besting a Rogue, Paladin, Mage, or Druid defender consistently.  Honestly, Warlock is very strong in all of those matches.  They do great in blacksmith pushes and have large impact there.  They are great at crippling enemies running alone the road.  They are great at deterring enemies from wanting to contest in small numbers.  Warlocks do well when outnumbered and have soulstone.  They're just my pick for best all around contribution to a AB victories.
---
God I remember first getting these as a hunter and seeing that +18 agility. Thought I was *the shit* running around in those. 
---
Let me tell you something: People who go into leveling dungeons just for the loot are wasting their time.
---
If you go into a leveling dungeon for the quests or because you want to do some group content then you'll have a good time. Don't go without having prepared quests. Don't go with a group who wants to do just one part or one wing of a leveling dungeons, they go for the loot.  Got with a group that wants to do the quests and the whole thing, this way everyone gets something out of it.
---
If you see loot that you will use, need it, if not, greed it. Don't worry about it afterwards and just play on. That +5 agi on your dagger won't make a difference.
---
Warrior+Shaman windfury hnnng
---
Wait, sorry.. the only keys you use are to move forward and backwards?? I basically use half my keyboard. 
---
If you want to be more effective I  would recommend using w s a d for moving around and then at least using 1 to 4 for the most common spells. Anything else you need fast access to you put on q e or r.  I would say that is a minimum requirement of you wanna play with other people.
---
But each to his/her own. If you mostly play solo then you can do however you want. 
---
&gt; If they made everything the same like they did, but kept the level cap and only introduced reputation on hard more or a alike, kept gear progress t1,t2,t3 -&gt;*outland greens*-&gt; t4,t5,t6 without outland greens filled in to be better than AQ/naxx gear, but better than classic greens for sure, and balanced the game on that point, id still be playing WoW.
---
So what you're saying is TBC, but with changes.  And what /u/MwHighlander said was
---
&gt; I'd rather see classic + than TBC.
---
I think you guys kinda want the same thing.  Whether it's technically called "TBC" or "Classic+" is kinda splitting hairs -- the point is that it would be great to see a sort of "reboot" to WoW in which they continue adding to the game without slowly going down the path of ruin it went down the first time.  The majority of the new stuff in TBC was great, but it also paved the way for a few of the elements that turned into bad stuff later on.
---
do u know how long the time frame is between phases?
---
I can second this. My main server was a RP-PVP server and it was far better suited to my playstyle than the other options. 
---
Countdown to classic ain’t no YouTube channel. I highly recommend it if you’ve yet to tune in. The guests are chosen wisely.
---
Yeah, like I said, there are a lot of ways it could be implemented, and there would probably be some tweaking to it, but I think it would definitely help to encourage longer battles. I think if they did something like this that it would definitely need to go through some rigorous testing in Beta (which hopefully is coming soon!). 
---
No that's the updated one. The original was green and gave like three stam. 
---
Bind autorun to the mousewheel and go keyboardless.
---
Gatekeeping is a pretty poor way to get more players on your server.
---
Ret paladins didn't. Everything they bring can be brought by an actually useful Holy pally.
---
Yes... we will leveling and pvp
---
Yes, you'll need to strafe. You can lose the forward key if you really want by just holding both mouse buttons to run forward.
---
Honestly at the very least it would bring tbc into a major spotlight as an expansion to classic.  There’s so many road they can take with this though it’s hard to even guess. 
---
They could open tbc servers while leaving classic up
---
They could force tbc onto classic
---
They could attempt to make retail more classic like (highly highly doubt this works in the slightest without a full on reset) 
---
I’m not sure tbh 
---
Again, I know there's a difference. However, with a crit, you will still likely need to pause for a bit on either side
---
Brilliant idea. Let's just remove all PvP servers and make all servers PvE.
---
People who want to PvP can just flag themselves, after all.
---
Hire u/Wyke_Unchained now, this boy is a genius.
---
Lol he can unbind S
---
Warrior with any healer. Warriors are crazy efficient if they don't have to worry about hp
---
I’ve been playing rogue, tank DH and healing with priest for the last few years and had no problem with only two movement keys. Even not in PvP.
---
But I might give it a go.
---
Thanks!
---
Reputation is very important when it comes to AV. People are generally in the game for reputation, not honor. The people grinding honor are in WSG/AB premades. I'm not against increasing honor gains in AV slightly, but it should not equal or exceed WSG/AB wins. The major problem you encounter in AV are people wanting to grind reputation as quickly as possible and people wanting the longest battle as possible. People coming to AV to grind honor are generally confused. 
---
I wouldn't even know where to find a link to the pre-AQ version. I think it was 2 stam 6 spirit or something awful? 
---
Basically, cross realm battlegrounds makes it possible for the non-hardcore to compete (slightly) against the hardcore in the honor rankings. I guess they're butthurt that they're not obscenely rewarded for playing 14 hours per day.
---
My condolences.
---
It was 2 stam 6 spirit. Still better than no ring till 25s.
---
&gt; Let's look at the RPPvP official announcement. All the sudden EVERYONE is an god damn RPer.
---
They've been very vocal about wanting an RP server, the people that want RP-PVP have been vocal here since the very early days on this sub. I've personally been posting about this on the EU forums and we've been talking about it there for a very, very, very long time. Since before the new forums opened up.
---
&gt; Fuck off. 
---
Stick it up your arse. You've done no some research yet you shoot your mouth off like an ignorant prick.
---
&gt; I appreciate the RPers of the world, and can respect the fact that some  might want some open world PvP, but that's such a small percent.  Blizzard knows this. 
---
You don't appreciate otherwise you wouldn't be there speaking as if the words leaving your mouth and whispers straight from god in to your ear mate. RP-PVP servers died off because in retail the GMs couldn't be arsed to police RP servers properly and trolls turned up. Eventually people got sick of this and moved away to PVE to avoid feeding these idiots. If you're going to talk about something you could take five minutes to find out why, where and how.
---
If you're looking to future proof, I'd say go with a 1440p 144hz monitor with either g-sync or free-sync. The extra resolution is a nice step up from 1080p without being as hard to drive as 4k. Higher refresh rate is again optional, but I personally don't think I'll ever buy a 60hz monitor again. I haven't used either type of adaptive sync solution but I've heard great things about them. As far as PC specs to match that, I wouldn't go higher than a current gen i5/r5 paired with something like an RTX 2060.
---
Play horde I'd say! I'm rolling alliance because that's where it all started for me! (Also really wanna play pally) If the horde calls you, start there and make an alliance alt down the line if you wanna see the blue side of things.
---
Holy shit...
---
every server private i played in vanilla ally is a bunch of kids in world, only atack if you lower level or in 2 for gank , i will stay in horde maybe to avoid these tipe of people....
---
No classic is classic if you cant read and work it out then google it
---
Thanks for clarifying that for him :) 
---
Is that a Shaman with Draconic Deflector? Lol these are the glory days 
---
I realize I'm in the minority here, but I love Paladin t3 and think it's beautiful. I really like t2 but I prefer t3 honestly.
---
Agreed. Imagine that after years all content is played out, they will unlock e.g. mount hyal or karazhan for new classic tier set. They kind of doing this on oldschool runescape and it is working out great.
---
30/0/21 is also a pretty good heal spec lmao
---
That's what I hope as well, after launch.
---
Before launch, though, the developers should listen to this community, within reason. Usually, the "within reason" part is pretty grey-area and vague. However, we have a **very** clear "within reason" chart for us, and that is what happened within the scope of time from 1.0 to 1.12.
---
Due to the general lack of information on the project paired with the emphatically restated goal of the Classic team being to recreate 1.12 WoW as accurately as possible, the temperaments of the people who used to chant from the rooftops for changes when we had no news have been calmed. It's more of a "I can't complain because I don't know what to complain about" scenario now, and I'm very glad that it has come to that. It suppresses toxic discussions that we used to have on here, where anything was possible with this remake of Classic. But now, just like with the "within reason" argument, we have a guideline for what to expect that is rather large. That confined uncertainty is the reason things are so tame right now.
---
I agree with you almost 100% though. While we are in this state confined uncertainty, player opinions on here tend to be on topic and reserved in terms of expectations from the project. As such, they are relatively safe to seriously consider.
---
 After launch, Blizzard needs to shut it down, remove social media from their day to day lives and just take in bug reports. A lot of the feedback then will be nonsense and almost useless, as a lot of retail players will submit "ideas for improvement".
---
I can still remember the Wrath Pre-patch. The changes to Prot warriors were quite substantial as far as I can recall. 
---
The first thing I did on my warrior that patch, was fly to Black temple and gather up as many of the Demon Hunter apprentices there as possible to AoE them down. Something in the patch made that a lot easier than it had been previously.
---
Sorry but the real hero of leveling weapons is [this guy](https://classicdb.ch/?item=6953).
---
Very glad to hear it to be honest.  Thanks for the info man.
---
What if you wanna go backwards while looking forward? I use the S key all the time. Especially in pvp.
---
&gt;Wands were mostly just stat sticks back then
---
So was your main weapon.
---
You will be highly valued as an Alliance Warlock in PvE.
---
I'd hate to admit how many times I listened to this and the Halloween one on the old blizzard music player
---
As long as people are providing constructive criticism what does it matter? Without people voicing their concerns, we wouldn't be getting the 6 phase plan. Hell, we probably wouldn't even be getting classic if players didnt voice their disappointment in blizzards decisions. 
---
I don't think people look for an expansion after it already launched
---
What's the rationale for Priest+Lock?
---
I'm going horde for the first time after playing a Dwarf from 2005 onwards. I have a strong attachment to everything Alliance, but I've seen their specific content *so many times* that I'm definitely ready to see Azeroth through a new lens. Apparently horde leveling is better, which should be nice, and tauren druids (which I'm going to play) will be the least popular race/class combo, so I should feel more of a sense of uniqueness. 
---
If you're not bothered about being on a PVP server, at least if you do get sick of Alliance you can start a new toon on the same server and transfer all the gold. Going PVP means you have to start from scratch if you don't like it. But I think you'll be fine as an ally - our early zones and capitals are fantastic, you get to do Deadmines and Gnomer without the massive journey beforehand (can be rough getting to south Westfall as a level \~18).. go for it! 
---
That'll depend mostly on if theres a beta, i'd think.  Assuming they dont somehow make it impossible to develop addons on the beta, there should be plenty of them.
---
Best place to gank horde is obvious, hillsbrad fields.
---
4 strenth 5 stam leather belt, ahhhh oohhhhhh
---
Sure.  I wasnt trying to insult them or anything, i was simply making the point that by wrath the game was quite a bit different than vanilla, yet i still have some fond memories of having my wand/slot for it, vs how it is now where i wand is a mainhand item.
---
They share a sub, so the numbers may not tell you what you want to see.
---
IE: If I sign up so I can play classic, I'll probably play BFA as well to farm gold for my sub. I would only be playing BFA to fund Classic, but subs and playtime numbers wouldn't reflect that.
---
Then you're still not casual. True casual is a couple of hours here and a couple hours there and then 3 days too busy, and then an hour here...etc etc. 
---
But fair enough, you're not completely hardcore either (4h a day at least)
---
Which Paladin blessing do you guys prefer on each respective demon, and are there situations a different one suits better (e.g. leveling, farming, group, PvP, dungeons etc)?
---
Dot  dot dot... life tap, renew. No down time. 
---
I made a 19 mage for the sole purpose of annoying all the twink rogues with rank 1 frostbolt
---
Excellent work as always. Your contributions to the community are greatly enjoyed and appreciated!
---
I want to re-experience vanilla. So for me that means running the same faction and running the same race. I might not run the same class at first, but I do want the same starting zone experience. All the first level quests, the music, the atmosphere, everything.
---
and here I am with my max 4 hours a week :(, I will be Lucky if I got lvl 60 within a year :P
---
29 is my favorite for god-rogue fuckery.  A well stuffed 29 combat rogue with the PvP sword and outlaw saber is hard to beat.  Pop evasion and watch the pallys swing and miss.  Too much fun. 
---
i definitely didnt know this myself for a very long time, and when i told my friend it blew his mind too
---
Yeah, im not sure the last time i searched something like 'wow bfa'.  I may have searched for '_____ in bfa' (heirloom upgrades?), though even then ill usually search for it based on level (heirloom upgrades to 120).
---
Let alone how to handle the trash mobs that would play ping pong with the melee and ranged and literally wipe the entire raid.  :)
---
And don't forget...  'loot the dogs!'
---
Paladins tanked?
---
Ofcourse we don't get to enjoy threat reduction from skills or talents or a threat reset. Hence why we got to make a bit more liberal use of LIPs.
---
I would start working on official WoW:Classic then announced about it on next blizzcon, because they always ask about it there... wait...
---
I was terrified of it (of course I hate spiders as it is). The music and the darkness was so creepy!!
---
&gt; A lot of the feedback then will be nonsense and almost useless, as a lot of retail players will submit "ideas for improvement".
---
Not just retail players. There was a private server developer or something that told a story on ClassiCast I believe where people were trying to provide false proof to the team in order to make retribution paladins more viable. I have no doubt this will continue in Classic.
---
The private server community is already trying to make changes to match whatever server they played on, the ruination of the community aspects by demanding ridiculously populated mega servers is a prime example of this.
---
I hope they stick to their guns and say no to any changes that didn't happen during vanilla, regardless of the demand coming from retail players or private server players.
---
which class has an easier time completing pre-raid bis? not absolutely bis bis necesarily
---
besides warriors of course
---
Felwood was scary because it was so remote and desolate, which I loved again. :)
---
1.  Naked Horde ghosts running back to MC entrance -- very, very classic.
---
2.  LOOT THE DOGS!
---
3.  Dispel, dispel, DISPEL THE TANK!
---
give classic Karazhan 100% the same 
---
so you can get level 70 gear 
---
except you cant USE IT HAHAHAHA
---
the only things you get out it in the end is the mount i believe as even the enchants require higher then 300 
---
all as a nice tease and a challenge
---
Woah! The Troll warrior in Might has shoes!!!! Haha 😂 
---
Try adding a couple of keybinds and test it. Once you remember what key does what you'll see it's much more efficient than clicking everything. Then add more as you get comfortable.
---
Because the mortal races banded together four years ago banish the demons from this world you heretic!
---
...for reals that sucks though.
---
You're welcome friend :)
---
This. Same goes for Pallies as a Druid. You just fight for a while until you both realize you’re not going to die and then /bow and leave. 
---
His message is clear: We need to keep making noise!
---
Dude, as a priest wands were your MAIN DPS....
---
Regardless of your stance on the whole RP-PvP thing, it’s nice to see this kind of communication. 
---
so you have PVP realms where you CAN RP, and you have RP realms where you CAN PVP, what is the issue?
---
Some of the best times took place in Ashenvale 
---
"definitely keep making yourselves heard by sharing your feedback"
---
But yesterday I was told to stop crying like a "god damn baby."  I don't know what to do anymore?!?!!!
---
That has a lot of stuff in it that's not Phase 1.
---
Awesome! I was just looking this stuff up yesterday for a friend of mine! This will help me show them so much easier!
---
the dumbest of takes and entirely wrong 
---
And then you got your shit pushed in by a hunter before you're in range of him lol
---
Really? I would love to see where they said that. That would make me super happy!
---
That does give needless strain to your fingers though. If you have both fingers pressed, you will find it more difficult to use your thumb for the side buttons on the mouse any decent gamer would have.
---
[This is my favorite trend comparison](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=wow%20classic,osrs,wow%20bfa)
---
Cool! I like this. Two design pointers if you're still open to changes: The first dropdown is long and harder to find stuff, so I would suggest having only the races there, and having a separate dropdown for male and female. Second, whenever you change the current race/gender it resets the class back to Warrior. It would be handy to keep it the same so I can quickly cycle through the same gear sets on each race. But I'm really just looking at the sets because I'm trying to solidify on a race, so I'm doing a lot more comparing. Great tool!
---
On a totally separate note, are there any other vanilla hunters who are totally pained by the Beaststalker and Beastmaster sets? I think they fall WAY behind in the design skill and uniqueness compared to literally every other class dungeon set. It literally looks like a bunch of BOE greens. This is coming from a first-main Rogue POV, where I adored my Shadowcraft set &lt;3
---
That non-humans and non-orcs would take edgemasters handguards for the extra skill.
---
I'm afraid of opening this because if I look at druid T3 I might give up on rolling a shaman again.
---
How about actually trying to fight lvl 60 around raid entrances? This is more WPVP than ruining someone's effort to level if they have limited time to play to begin with.
---
Butthurt elitist nolifer spotted.
---
I'm afraid that RP-PvP just will turn into a PvP-Realm and People wont Role-Play that much. Same way current PvP-RP are working right now which is sad
---
No one uses this shit lol
---
I'm at work so it's difficult to go digging. But it was along the lines of technology reasons that it didn't stack prior, and allowing them to would still be in the spirit of Classic WoW but make the experience slightly better for a subsect of players.
---
Exactly!!!!!
---
gnome for everything no competition 
---
Well first you find yourself a bucket...
---
Yeah, if you're not facing them you can't parry, etc. S is necessary.
---
I didnt really think i had to clarify, but when i said 'back then' i meant in Wrath, and i played a warlock at the time (again, as stated in my post).
---
Sadly alliance doesn’t have the best options compared to horde for ganking. Thousand needles is a pretty good one, along with stone talon mountains and maybe ashenvale. Hills brad fields as well as someone mentioned. 
---
But in reality, alliance has nowhere to gank that’s even close to the smorgasbord that is red ridge and dusk wood
---
No worries. Thanks for clarifying it a bit more tho!
---
Well sure without vanilla there is no TBC....was more referring to it being best xpac.
---
1,000% this.  I've spent countless hours there.  Even at 60 it's great because everyone wants to bring a body guard.
---
Thanks for the suggestions, both good ones that I will attempt next patch.
---
At least they talk with us about Classic not like BFA \*How ironic they put more work into classic than BFA\*
---
He’s saying he only using two keys to move, ie go forward or backwards. He doesn’t have strafe / turn camera keys; at least I hope that’s what he means!
---
If you play a stealthy just hang out in stranglethorn or southshore. Works for both sides. Just stealth and pick your targets.
---
Why would I be fighting my pallys in a BG?
---
Frost mage becoming a pet cd class was bad, ice lance critting harder than a frostbolt, frostbolt crits used to do 33% of a geared pvpers hp at worst, they hit for 10% and crit for 20% of your hp in TBC before that disgusting stat resilience was taken into account. Pvp in a box being the new meta to balance around which was a bad change in philosophy. Flying mounts were bad, jewelcrafting was overpowered because of personal perks making it required to "max" your gear. Older zones made redundant, the new zones were fewer in number, the zones were more streamlined to get you from 60 to 70 with no rested exp and you would get there in the exact same quest greens as everyone else. Classic had triprunner pants and the emberstone staff sure, but this was even more railroading.
---
Mage T4 is one of the best sets ever made though and Karazhan was just a lot of fun and artisitically was very tastefully done, to name some upsides. Not enough to make me want TBC, though.
---
[hehe](https://imgur.com/BzaSvXe)
---
Gnomes make perfect warlocks!
---
They have already specifically stated that there will be RP PVP servers. I believe they might have even said there will likely be 1 per region. On what are you basing your pessimism?
---
Wow.. this just made my decision harder
---
Did everyone in this thread forget the Dragonstalker set exists??? I've always thought that was one of the coolest looking sets in the game. And it's actually good in PvE too.
---
Constructive criticism is the reason we got 6 stages instead of 4. I don't care for RP-PvP realms so I will leave that up to you people that really wants it.
---
Can't you just flag yourself for PvP if you want the authentic horde vs alliance conflict in an RP setting?
---
Sure, the people you meet in the opposing faction might not have flagged themselves, but that just means they don't want the rivalry to be on at that time. I'd rather have the option of flagging myself if I want to RP a horde vs alliance battle, and not risk getting my rp sessions interrupted by an opposing faction raid when it doesn't fit the setting.
---
Hey give it a shot.  Worst case you could always switch.  I went from my main Holy Pally to Rogue which are two completely different play styles and I loved the utilities a Rogue offers.
---
I used to play there on Horde trough TBC-WoD, It was known as a World PvP Capital for many years, I didn't play since I wonder how it is now.
---
RP was not as common but it was there.
---
What is osrs and why does it pertain to WoW?
---
I think the Vanilla commitment is too high to want to transfer.
---
If RPPVP is available at launch, I’m all in. If it’s announced to be a week after launch, I’ll regretfully wait. If it’s any longer, then I’m not joining. I’m not putting 3 months into the vanilla grind just to abandon it later for another server.
---
That CM took a look at this sub and thought:
---
*Hmm, this place needs more whine posts*
---
Lord of Light help us all.
---
It is mostly just horrible data comparison/presentation. 
---
First, almost no one would search for bfa/battleforazeroth. Yeah that is the expansion title, but google searches are a good representation of outside interest only. Few to no active players will do google searches for the game by the internal lingo, rather outside searches will simple be for 'world of warcraft'.
---
I ran the 'classic wow' vs. 'world of warcraft' and is is interesting. Currently, classic wow searches are about half that of world of warcraft searches. This is a huge statement to the hype behind classic in the months leading up to release with people seeking out any morsel of information. However even this increased interest is only \~15% of hype for retail in the months leading up to BfA.
---
This could possibly be a good indicator for approximate game population, and if Classic is 15% the population of Retail, it will be a massive success.
---
You didn't even get the stats right. It's [4 Strength 4 Stam](http://classicdb.ch/?item=6382).
---
Stop complaining.
---
Old School Runescape. For some reason it's having a huge revival. Kind of a funny comparison Asmongold stumbled upon back in January as it seems to be beating WoW in the trends.
---
There was a dev Q&amp;A literally yesterday. 
---
If your pala healer had this in stockades, you knew you were going to make it through.
---
https://emberwow.com/ swing by that site and apply if you haven't sorted your guild yet 👍😊
---
back pedal is important for going down cliffs slowly as moving forward always has a higher speed and moves in bigger chunks.
---
I think it's pretty obvious from the responses that alot of people are hoping for a rp-pvp realm. Probably more than blizzard thought. Good that they seem to listen. 
---
&gt;The private server community is already trying to make changes to match whatever server they played on, the ruination of the community aspects by demanding ridiculously populated mega servers is a prime example of this.
---
I didn't list the pserver people who are trying to operate within this confined uncertainty, but I probably should've. Things like AV 1.8 instead of 1.12 are indicative of a smaller, more hidden sect of people.
---
The pservers are not accurate 1.12, but that's what many people think they are, and that is equally as dangerous as retail players asking for changes. The retail players are usually really easy to catch. The pserver players that seek to emulate pservers in Classic are a problem, and that's why I'm glad the Classic team has the right mindset and can call out inconsistencies like the Warlock summoning "bug" in the demo.
---
I don’t understand why they won’t just add one at launch - see how it works out - and if it flops just close the server &amp; offer a free server transfer for those. 
---
The only reason to roll on a PVP server is ganking. 
---
Why would you argue for Blizzard to add Cross Realm Battlegrounds, something they eventually added to address a problem, before seeing if that problem even exists? To me, that is like arguing for free server transfers from specific servers from day one. 
---
They can always add it 6 months or a year down the line if it is truly necessary; once adding it they would never remove it because it would be near impossible to determine what queues would be like if you did. Blizzard is aware that BG queues can be an issue on low population and faction imbalanced servers - why not focus your efforts on having them address those issues prior to people being in game so their in game experience can be better?
---
And please, can we all quit with the smarmy "1.12 you said you wanted no changes" comments? I don't ever recall seeing anyone ever request for WoW patch 1.12 with no changes. Everyone I have ever seen advocating no changes has always been about not including things that weren't in Vanilla. No transmog, no CRZ, stuff like that. 
---
It's not RP at all to do both at same time ! :D
---
Lock can go full damage and life tap while the priest heal him and dot as well + on harder mobs priest have shadow weaving which increase shadow damage of lock
---
Without delving too far into it. I was having a discussion about the whole AV thing and someone told me it was pointless to talk about it because they'd never listen.
---
A small bit of vindication here.
---
Probably an offtank shaman :D
---
What part of "Lets Play WoW and Pretend It's 2005" are you just not getting here?
---
Seemed from his response that he was in fact clicking everything else. Btw, I can't remember if a and d are set to turn camera by default. If so you definitely wanna change that to strafe. 
---
Would be better if it remembered class when switching race.
---
Played horde through TBC. Switched to Alli up until now. Will be returning to my roots gamewise and factionwise this summer. If you've never walked through the front gates of stormwind as a lvl 8 nooblet, then it's something you should experience.
---
That feeling I dont have at BFA.. I get a new weapon and 2 min. later I forgot that I got a weapon
---
&gt;Crap, i just used my 2 best pots
---
Ahahah :)
---
I live c2c but it seems really weird that the guy didn't play classic yet hosts it. He's also good though
---
I like your determination.
---
I thought drinking would stop the food.  Even worse, I thought to myself, wth?  Let me try to bandage too!
---
#BRINGBACKPINKSHAMANS
---
Edgy take there :rolleyes:
---
Oh. Oh no...
---
Thank you! Just what I was looking for!! 
---
I don't really see why anyone would be against a rp-pvp realm. I mean it doesn't take anything away from those not wanting to play there. It's more a case of enough people showing that we want it and the rest don't have to say anything.
---
...no. Classic is a new PC release.
---
Halo 1 came out almost 20 years ago, but the MCC is still a new PC release.
---
Final Fantasy VII is over 20 years old, but the Switch version is a new release.
---
This trend shows that a new release (Classic) is more popular (and barely) than BFA, which hasn’t had any major announcements or news since launch. Why would people be searching for BFA anyways? 
---
Also, trending means nothing. Things can trend for good or bad reasons. It’s not a marker of quality.
---
Yes but actually No. The issue is that P-Servers are not 100% Blizzlike since some Mechanics are scripted differently. For Example Onyxia scripting was different on Nostarlius compared to Vanilla. So this means that even C'thun will be different on Retail. Which means that he will be even pain in the arse for Hardcore Vanilla Raiders.
---
There is a lot of bad information here.
---
1) leveling - you can go fury prot or fury arms to level. Fury prot for leveling is to go prot up until revenge and then go fury. The revenge stun is really good for leveling by yourself until you get whirlwind axe. You can then go arms, or fury arms, or keep your fury prot spec if you like tanking dungeons.
---
2) aoe threat is always an issue, spamming demo/battleshout works at super low levels. Battle about threat may or may not be super high at low level depending on the vslues they use. A safe bet on a 3-4 mob pull is to not tank the first kill target and focus threat and targets 2 and 3, then taunt 4.
---
3) prot is a garbage spec in my opinion. Fury prot is far superior because of the ability to modulate your threat. You can decide to dual wield for extra threat, or use a sword and board for hard hitters. Most mobs don’t require sword and board. Spec the prot tree up until sunder and then go into fury. The later talents in prot are all garbage. 
---
&gt; The pserver players that seek to emulate pservers in Classic are a problem, and that's why I'm glad the Classic team has the right mindset and can call out inconsistencies like the Warlock summoning "bug" in the demo.
---
Yeah that was amazing and I love that they're thorough with these things. There are private server players that argue over it to this day, claiming that Blizzard is lying and what not :)
---
I was a Tauren Shaman in vanilla... I had a 20 minute fight with a Pally until he decided to bubble hearth. Pretty sure it would have gone for an hour.
---
He did play retail vanilla, just not hardcore. He played rogue, spent a lot of time on the AH. Said he was one of the richest on his server. 
---
Give the warriors whatever the fuck they want. Their leveling experience is terrible enough already.
---
Hogger feels the disrespect.
---
Hunter Hunter lel
---
Yeah, when I played WoW we had to stroke our own dick. In the snow. Uphill. Both ways!
---
Crying like a baby =/= sharing your feedback.
---
Post Example A: RP-PVP Realms would be good to have because reason X, Y, and Z.
---
Post Example B: This is such a stupid call to make.
---
One of these things is feedback, the other is useless bitching.
---
Emerald armour boiz
---
So basically wowhead but not nearly as complete or functional?
---
Yeah. If I want retail information I will search "fury warrior pvp " and all the top hits will be retail. There is no need to search "fury warrior pvp BFA". If I want vanilla info I will search "fury warrior pvp vanilla wow".
---
Maybe that will change when classic is actually out, but right now I think it's obvious people don't use retail-specific search terms because they're not necessary to find stuff.
---
As long as the factions on every server are not balanced, I think the positives outweigh the negatives. Most people only have time for a couple of hours to play every day, and would rather not wait 30 mins for the BG to pop. Saying that one would not play classic at all solely because of cross-realm BGs seems a bit ridiculous to me. 
---
use backslash \ before the hashtag \# and it won't make your text large and show it.
---
I remember reading the Mor'Ladim story ingame and killing him in the flesh. Very awesome.
---
feedback doesn't stop being feedback just because it's worded in a mean way 
---
Looks cool.
---
I'm for this, but that's a slippery slope imo
---
You listen to the CM that tells you to keep giving feedback and ignore the rest. Reminding the naysayers that Classic WoW is happening only because of sustained player complaints and insistence on the value/appeal of a high quality vanilla recreation doesn't hurt either.
---
I was always afraid while traveling through Duskwood.
---
Afraid of getting caught by Alliance while I'm trying to buy Jumper Cables or find the Forsaken questgivers at the ass-end of the zone. :D
---
Maybe i did not formulate mysef well enough. But i’m not advocating against or for a questhelper. I just think its strange that some people are against the retail questhelper yet they think an addon that does that exact same thing is totally fine.
---
I have numerous cutting edge achievements throughout wod and legion actually. I quit right after night hold in legion. Guldan was a glorious fight. Thanks though
---
Its a weird dynamic.  I’m half thinking that the only reason it even came up was because someone said “we’re not going to have one” and our natural response is “don’t you tell me what I can’t have!” Even if RP-PVP hasn’t necessarily justified itself in the past.  
---
I’d be all for it.  Played on an RP (normie) realm myself back in the day, but it was mostly so I didn’t have to see Misterlister &lt;Sister Fister&gt; on characters everywhere I went.  It just feels like a bit of a contradiction since WoW PvP in vanilla was 99% “how can I mess with these guys”, where RP is about cooperation.  
---
Stun resist outweighs all other racials. That’s the end of the debate.
---
Guess you didn't understood the point I try to say.   
---
Ppl cried about Titanforge and Azarite Gear. Blizzard didn't change anything  
---
ppl cried about sharding in Classic. Ppl said that they understand and they wanna solve it with the comunity  
---
See the difference? 
---
Thing is, no one searches "wow bfa", they just search "bfa", and if you put that in trends, bfa has a massive lead. Although it's obviously hard to compare fairly, maybe single word searches just have an advantage in trends.google.
---
I got you fam!
---
https://itemization.info/item/2933
---
You're right. He just didn't raid much, right?
---
Going to disagree with you on the Druid front.
---
I quit playing during TBC, so my belief that Vanilla &gt; TBC was an opinion I held back then and has nothing to do with a lack of playing or my proximity to someone's ass.
---
Yes, you do mate. That's why they exist in the first place. Blizzard didn't add them for no reason. They have a special set of rules and these rules allow roleplayers to flourish. RP doesn't flourish with out the special ruleset that the other servers don't have. They can't fucking get anything done with out being trolled, harrassed, or interrupted. Something that is punishable on an RP server. PVP servers are like a containment board and PVE is only slightly better. The rules of an RP serve a big purpose. The average player shouldn't be forced to follow them on a PVE server or a PVP server.
---
i don't get it, can you explain how it works?
---
Tbc was a more balanced game, but i love the classic world
---
Your post has been automatically removed because you used a keyword which is reserved for the subreddit moderators.
---
This applies to most of reddit. Over in r/NYC people circle jerk over a ton of nonsense that 99% of new Yorkers dont give a shit about.
---
Same thing happens here.
---
People vocalizing their opinions is great and all but doesnt tend to be representative of the community at large.
---
I blame u/Babyhoof.
---
it should be posted every fucking day until classic comes out.
---
spent countless hours watching pure pwnage and playing wow.
---
My question was how far you guys made it in, then i saw this lol
---
Making noise is why we even have Classic WoW.
---
Could you please tell me, why SM/Ruin build has 4 points in CoE? As far as I can see, it's a PvE raiding build.
---
Three strong instant dots between them as soon as 14 and eventually shadow weaving.
---
Crowd control that no other combination has. Both have fears. Shackle helps handle undead overpulls that locks have a harder time with.  Locks have banish for elemental/demons, not really an issue for priests but still useful.  Enslave demon and mind control for some elite quests and pvp.  Dual mana burns and dispels with felhunter.
---
Buff and talent/skill synergy spirit tap, lifetap, renew, vamp embrace, fortitude, wipe prevention in soulstone, a tanky pet, health stones if the priest wants one.  
---
This combo should be chain pulling 3-4 mobs when they're available. 1-2 Tanked by the pet, one of which is almost dead that the priest is going to last hit, the other 1-2 rotting away in a fear. 
---
That said, you can turn off world chat...
---
It comes with the territory of a loot council guild. If someone suffers from such obstacles as 
---
&gt; having to play in front of their families, disability or social problems, or simply because of an age differential
---
then they probably should find a guild that doesn't use loot council so they can rely on a numerical system rather than social acumen.
---
I like loot council best because for me, Vanilla WoW is like golf or bowling. The game, even at its most challenging, is really only there as a group activity to facilitate a social life. I don't understand the motivations of the person who is playing this ancient content while being standoffish. It seems like they might prefer a single-player game.
---
But you're right: in guild after guild, I do always end up in the "insider clique" of people either on the loot council or doing well in that system. It's not random chance and anyone willing focus on the good of the team while wearing their extrovert hat can manage it.
---
IMO closest equivalent to Redridge for the Horde are Stonetalon Mountains.
---
A release date would be nice..
---
&gt; tauren druids will be the least popular race/class combo
---
It's not like you can play a troll or an orc druid ;-)
---
Race wise I think Trolls are even less popular than Taurens.
---
Wait lvl 30 before you decide you don't like druids. Lvl 1-10 are particularly despairing (Mulgore is glorious though). 
---
And listening to the knee-jerk reddit mob is an excellent way to end up with empty servers.
---
It was a learning experience for most if not all involved ;)
---
I agree with you on almost everything, but the community had a large part in shaping the way retail is. Players asked for little conveniences over and over until the entire game became convenient and nothing takes effort anymore.
---
The BFD wand and Noxious Shooter are more iconic. 
---
That isn't similar to how it was in vanilla. They were taken out in 1.04 (5/5/2005). There was 6 months before it went away. I would be okay with them bringing them back for the first 6 months like in Vanilla. I got one on my retail account now and still use it all the time. There would be no way I would have gotten it if it was only a month haha 
---
First time I did Duskwood was in adulthood and on a private server. Most of the time it just had an amazing atmosphere I was sucked into. But I felt true terror trying to explore the crypts alone fun time. Also the Mor’ladim questline is likely the quest most strongly imprinted in my memory.
---
A blue post? :D
---
Jk, I believe the classic release date will be anounced within next four weeks, or even before easter. I am calling it.
---
If you decide to roll on a PVE server please stay horde (I will).
---
On PVP servers factions are quite balanced but on PVE it's like 80 to 90% Alliance.
---
I understand the desire for accessibility. An MMO is not an accessibility genre, and as we've seen over the past 14 years of development of this game, neuters the MMO experience. It sucks for me too because I'm not flush with time these days either, but to jockey for an action that I believe would compromise the game and its community for my own personal benefit is not something I want to do or support. Luckily, as it pertains to PVP, we have the ingenious PVP weekend that gets the queues flying, but honestly, I don't believe you're experience of waiting for hours on end for a queue pop is typical at 60. What were your server metrics/ What are the server metrics today? Was it dominated by 1 faction? Horde and Alliance get close to a 50/50 split, but sometimes servers get out of wack, but I believe that was a symptom of free transfers.
---
Depends which version is in at launch. The buffed version is great, the earlier version is only like 11dps iirc. 
---
If you started tanking in Wrath, then the most important tanking lesson you can learn is that there aren't going to be any AOE pulls. 
---
Your job, as a tank, is to mark mobs for CC and kill order. Skull = 1st kill. Red X = 2nd kill.  Blue square = hunter trap.  Moon = mage sheep. Other CC symbols (sap, sleep, etc) are discussed as needed.
---
Maybe, but it makes the feedback counter productive.
---
I think being able to turn in quests is better than not having DKs. Nothing was more frustrating when leveling tbh. If the quest givers just became inactive, then I'm not sure why you would even kill them in the first place.
---
Didn't raid at all I believe. But the concept of his show is using calls and inputs from people who are more experienced with vanilla than he is, and I think it works very well. 
---
Nah kill all peoples they're terrible for the environment.
---
Oddly enough, I roll PvP as a casual to feel the dread and danger you provide!
---
When did blizz say that about sharding? Cause it wasn't in their announcement. This post is about rp-pvp, see the difference?
---
I'm planning on playing a Gnome mage. But I'm torn on professions. 
---
On one hand going skinning/mining would net more gold for mounts and skills.
---
But alchemy/herbalism would give me an advantage while leveling by having steady consumables and perhaps some endgame income as well.
---
PvP schedule
---
It was the beginning of the destruction of the world. Not just the fact that you abandon Azeroth for most of the playing, but everything was much more segmented off. Summoning stones meant many people didn't even know how to get to some of the dungeons. Classes were beginning to lose what made them unique. Daily quests separated people from each other by giving them a job to do every day and creating the scenario of "I did that one already, but I still need to do this other you that you already did."
---
&gt;plus cheetas
---
don't cheat, you'll get banned.
---
The kultiran keep in durotar has a pvp flagged NPC that's needed for a quest.
---
Create a lvl 8-10 twink, put some greenish gear and a green tabard with a yellow anchor.
---
Enjoy all the confused lowbies trying to figure out why an npc is killing them so fast.
---
April: PVP announcements ⚔️ 
---
May: release date 🗓

June: possible selected closed beta 🤫 💻

July: launch 🚀

And at midway points: blue posts regarding RPPVP, Loot Trading, and future plans 
---
JUSTDROPPEDMYVALORHELM, HOW COULD I ROLL A SIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIX?!
---
&gt; Without dynamic respawns a lot of vanilla quests can only handle 2 - 3 people doing them, so people would have to basically ignore questing and just grind mobs for most levels.
---
And WITH dynamic respawn, even more players would ignore questing since grinding would be so much more efficient.
---
Just google classic wow dressing room?
---
Wrath broke tanking. Everything just became AOE spam like we were are TBC pallies outgearing dungeons. It's honestly what created a real divide in the player community and, when Blizz tuned Cat dungeons to be more like Vanilla/TBC, there was an INCREDIBLE amount of forum whining because they couldn't be zerged anywhere. This is when the term "Wrath Baby" came into existence.
---
1-12 will take 4 hours even if not on opening day. 
---
Don’t think that’s in 1.12
---
Stonetalon Mountains is a great place to find fresh faced Horde adventurers, so excited to venture into a new zone with new quests and glory to be found! Fresh faces are the most fun to mount on a pike.
---
Sorry to say, but that won't exist in classic. It was already fixed before 1.12.
---
Yeah I enjoy it
---
It’s always alliance, landing on their way to SM and ganking lowbies.
---
I don't mean increasing the honor gained overall, I just mean making it much less punishing to have long drawn out games, where even the winners of that type of game is getting less honor than simply rushing games. And yeah, people hard pushing honor to get rank 14 probably won't be doing AV, but people going for slightly lower ranks, maybe no grinding quite as vigorously will want to do AV, if only to break up the multiple week monotony of the grind. However it's no fun when you don't get rewarded for your time playing and instead feel punished for playing the game the more enjoyable way.
---
So, I was running Scralet Monastery in a group with such hunter. The problem is that I was Prot(!!!) Warrior tank and I couldn't compete with threat generation of his dog. His dog was that rare pet that in some patch did shadow damage instead of physical. It was one of the worst dungeon runs in my life. I felt useless.
---
Can you explain the difference in leveling during BC vs Classic. Afaik, 1-60 was pretty much the same until near the end when exp requirements were nerfed
---
I remember when I found out that I could do both *and then shadowmeld!* That was the exciting portion.
---
&gt; dont use tab targetting. It's random and ...
---
&gt; 
---
It's not random.  I don't know how to describe it succinctly, but you can play it (at least the first time you tab).
---
I reckon this [one](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=wow%20classic,osrs,WoW,%2Fm%2F021dvx) is better though. 
---
As i do search for "WoW Classic" .... but i would never search for "WoW bfa", if i want to find something in retail i just search for WoW, and i bet a lot of ppl would do that. 
---
I always played as hunter and after a few pulls and nailing double ice trap CC and good pet management with pet on passive, dismissing pet for shortcuts, protecting healer with pet,  etc usually gets me a compliment in party chat. 
---
I love that feeling of being good at a class crowded with noobs. When I message the tank and healer for future runs, they accept.
---
I did ST last night as the only CC. I would double trap a large drake and off tank a smaller. The group was floored. 
---
Haha, I was 20+ when I found out cats and bears eat!
---
Defias Brotherhood on EU had the same. 
---
Shit was poppin.
---
It definitely comes down to personality. Some people are entertaining to watch and some aren't, just like any other spectator activity.
---
Some folks just act like themselves and their reactions to things happening in a game can be pretty entertaining (Shroud, for example).
---
Others cultivate a character that reacts in an over-the-top manner tha some people enjoy watching (Dr. Disrespect).
---
I can't really speak to any MMORPG streamers, just FPS guys. I've never watched somebody stream a RPG because I just don't see the appeal. 
---
 **\[Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker\]**
---
People would be much less upset if blizzard could just get out of its own way. They just make odd decisions all the freaking time. It’s what has led to retail and has me worried about classic at this point. 
---
Ahhh, yess, the "learning" runs! I remember these quite well. esp when the entire guild finally got attuned and we get wipe by the first 2 mobs lmao, then we learned how to pull everything solo.
---
I bet that name is Runescape inspired!
---
Orgrimmar obviously, if you're not a pussy.
---
Wrath set and Dreadnaught set say Hi.
---
and then if we end up getting progressive servers for other expansions, when do we cut it off? all the way up until BFA classic? i’d rather not have other expansions because it would divide the community a lot more, but that’s just my tiny opinion 
---
Yeah, that’s why you always hear: “TAKE GROWL OFF YOUR PET!”  Intimidation was almost always guaranteed to take agro off the tank from my experience.
---
This was my first experience too! Haha! That brought back a lot of memories!  
---
Thank you! x)
---
And yet people here complain that Blizzard listening to what people told them to do ruined retail WoW in the first place.
---
I love how ordinary and crap people look like. No fancy transformations, no one 100% prepared, everybody missing an item and at least 10 people waiting for the same drop. 
---
And the moment that you see a Shaman in your group, you feel safe; everything will be just fine
---
wiped
---
On standard RP, you'd be able to just flag yourself for pvp with /pvp, right?
---
Make a mouse over macro for sunder armor so you can generate threat on cc'd targets so when the polymorph breaks it doesnt destroy your healer.
---
Why get this when you would get the Old Murk-eye for a only slightly higher level quest wand which was better?
---
I've leveled as the warrior in a (feral)druid+warrior comp and it's pretty lame for the warrior.  Front stabbing antics aside, the druid can just take off (literally when feline swiftness comes online).  Mobs are dying faster than my cooldown on charge so I might get there for a last hit and then on to the next mob.  It wasn't a very mutually beneficial duo.  Exacerbated by traveling, you go back to a quest hub, the druid beats you by a minute and vendors, turns in quests, picks up new quests, mails stuff before you even get there. You could have the druid play a balance playstyle but then it's gimping the druid's amazing leveling toolkit.  Imo druids are best with the other two classes that can move with them, hunters and shamans.
---
Yea it's been 100% confirmed there will be no dual spec. The very idea of it is antithetical to classic. 
---
IME with loot council the best way to avoid being overlooked is to build a reputation one way or another. It requires getting attention. Things like showing up for raids reliably, on time, with consumables, etc... and doing 5mans with guildies tend to be baseline expectations.
---
In my current guild, one of the class officers only joins disc for raids or on request in 5mans and he(?) speaks so rarely I coudln't recognize his voice. But he's also the guy who runs the guild website, gives out free GFPP during raids, and donates a black lotus every week for Titans flask. Great example of "demonstrate commitment in some other way." Maybe to some people it sounds like "buying loot" or "corruption," but I see it as doing all he can to accelerate progression.
---
Loot systems that take into account only who shows up for raids are the best choice for players who really only want to show up for raids and don't care to invest much in the guild beyond that.
---
Any Blessing works, except Might on an Imp obviously. If you want to min-max, here you go.
---
Wisdom is great for Voidwalkers in particular if they are tanking, as their mana efficiency is complete garbage. Again, Might is also an option if the Voidwalker can't hold agro well enough however.
---
Felhunters/Succubus probably Might. Felhunters don't really spend too much mana in general, and Succubus aren't as "mana-spongy" as Voidwalkers.
---
Kings, if one has it, is a pretty good middle-ground option for those who aren't sure which to pick. Except Imp obviously.
---
There's no need for the other blessings honestly. Salvation is pretty unimportant as they likely won't take aggro anytime soon (or literally hurts Voidwalkers) and they likely won't need targeted Paladin heals that takes Blessing of Light to account.
---
SL warlock is probably best in pvp
---
This may sound nuts, but I’m actually looking forward to DoT + Wanding mobs down as I level my priest.  
---
Does Sunder armor not break CC (because it doesn't do damage, I guess)?  I can't remember if it did later on before it was removed.
---
Have you tried Ratchet? There's a Warlock tower north of town that has some trainers there. However I believe they do not have reputation discounts so don't use them too often!
---
Thankfully the Menethil harbor boat isn't too torturous.
---
Just remember to use the 5 sec rule with spirit tap, so you get your mana back... no need for water then!
---
You get all the perks of regular PVP with the addition of the RP environment and events!
---
It’s our boy Zug again
---
The only people who go fury/prot are hardcore players who dual wield tank and complete idiots.
---
Gorilla is the best for aoe tanking, but what are you planning on doing and with how many people?  I don't think its needed for just questing and elite mobs out in the world.  You should burn through stuff prettu quick and be unkillable with a healer.  If you want to do dungeons make a warrior friend.
---
Night elf priests are the ultimate griefers. Not only do you have all the mc dispell fear etc of a normal priest, you also have shadowmeld. But most of all you're even griefing yourself.
---
Pretty sure gorilla thunder clap is the best aoe threat you’ll get from a hunter pet. It’s on a minute CD and will only hold aggro on multiple mobs for a couple of seconds if anyone is using any aoe or healing. 
---
a bald male gnome with the grin face is also +2% dps
---
I'm pretty sure I just ready a great wall of fanboying over an expansion that improved only some aspects, while removing huge chunks of actual game content.
---
Also, Number growth from zero to 7.5M is far more difficult than climbing from 7.5 to 10M.
---
Or you could just play your pet like a warrior does.  Focus dps on one mob and have your pet tab auto/claw the other two. 
---
I've been using this name a long long time.  As far as I know I was the first.
---
Definitely before 2001, when Runescape came out.
---
I like to think I inspired them.  There's also a now obsolete/defunct software from Microsoft called SilverLight.   I'm glad that didn't catch on.
---
"Who needs a social life?"
---
You mean who needs drama and stress in their life xD
---
It has a place for wpvp and long duels. But most deff not the best when it comes to bgs, sm ruin is preffered in that case.
---
I can highly respect WOLTK for what it was. TBC I really think is overrated. 
---
The reason why Blizz is making those blue posts is to recieve community response. 
---
People tent to be more on negative side when they don't like something while at the same time being on quiet side when things are doing fine. Still when 6 phases were announced everyone was happy (for the most part). As for AV - it was more on the mixed side turning to negative and as for RPPvP servers- most people really don't care TBH. The only ones who are vocal are few that do want that type of server to exist... most people have nothing to say other than maybe... I guess someone wants it so let them have it, I'm playing on PvP anyway. 
---
Cannot find this guy anywhere. Are you sure this was vanilla?

Cant find anything on gilnash anywhere

This is the first orange drop in this reddits raid.

&gt; information about reactions to a product, a person's performance of a task, etc. **which is used as a basis for improvement**.
---
Saying that something sucks doesn't promote a basis for improvement. Angrily disagreeing with a decision doesn't make someone else go: "Golly gee, your generic anger sure made me see why my decision was a bad one and it showed me how I could make it better!"
---
Facepalm
---
Maybe slightly reducing overall reputation/honor gains through victory/defeat and raising reputation/honor gains through killing balinda/galvangar to let side objectives getting more important instead of just pushing trough.
---
Do not remember seeing them both dead in the last games i played.
---
Remember my last try to kill balinda we got stopped through some alliance defenders and our little group not tried again because some rushed to the front after they revived. Since then never ever seen anyone trying to kill them. Maybe this could work. 
---
Or raising chances of dropping blood and armor shreds to let more people running back.
---
Would not implement any gains in relation to the towers because they will always be captured to have an easy fight at the end. Maybe buffing slightly each Marshall to let them be a really hindrance at the end fight if not every tower is down.
---
Easiest way would be to implement some more npcs at strategic points. You cant rush anymore because there are enough defending players and npcs wo can kill you before you got through them by mount. It was like this back then if my memory serves me right.
---
If you would change the honor/reputation system or add some more npcs, can't say which is more work.
---
Question is what will causal players doing and will there be a zerg/rush meta. 
---
Maybe we will have epic battles like the old days, because everyone wants to get this experience (me too). 
---
Understand your point of not loving 1.12 av and your wish to tweak some things.
---
Maybe they will tweak a little bit because of the player reaction. 
---
I'm mainly thinking about dungeons. We'll have a shaman for healing, warlock which would provide some tanking ability with vw too and mage plus rogue for cc. 
---
Swim around in the sub revenue like scrooge mcduck
---
Or easier. Many pservers disable wBuffs for example, which is not blizzlike, just to make things harder. Or increase HP of boss.
---
Not on hunter. You should be using your mouse to turn. You shoot, instantly 180 with mouse and run until your auto is ready and then instant 180 back with a full stop, then repeat. That's how you kite. Backpeddling is garbage that moves at 50% speed. Strafe keys are important, but having a backpeddle bound is setting yourself up for kiting failure. Better to get used to mouse movement from level 1. Only tanks should backpeddle.
---
My only worry is that the pet would not do enough damage to keep mobs off the healer if spreading the damage like that. Also it's quite micro intensive which i would likely be awful at to begin with. 
---
With regards to RP-PVP servers... I believe that most people really don't care about it. 
---
Like this, the only people that do actually care are those that do want that server and so this topic became somewhat negative.
---
As for those that don't care... seeing that someone does want it, they just go along with "Oh well: they want it, so let them have it"
---
That 3% crit from moonkin form is for the team. You ol’ whiney ass. 
---
To retail? Nothing. They'll probably just make TBC.
---
This won't be possible. 
---
In 1.12, WF has recieved 2 majors nerfs. Total AP bonus on extra attacks and WF cannot chain proc off itself.
---
However, Enhance has access to Stormstrike in 1.12... so I guess there is that.
---
That would be perfect if it was on a 10 sec cd or something. I don't think a minute will cut it unfortunately. 
---
Yeah, I would advise against it.  Its doable but not nearly the best option.  If you want to try the pet tanking go with a single target tank.  You have lots of CC.
---
I was excited to be a DW shaman, and remembered 1.12 is literally the patch before shaman get DW.
---
Yeah that seems to be the best option, single target with cc. Or I might just roll fury warrior for the team! 
---
Rogue / Druid combo is pretty strong. You get the benefit of having 2 backstabbers and a healer.
---
Imagine typing this
---
Wake up sheeple!  The lizard men are feeding you word salad and putting chemicals in the water that turn the friggin frogs gay!

Most posters are saying this was fixed in 1.4
---
Undead 
---
Difference is the players reaction. Most players run through the gore because it is easy to avoid and does not affect you much.
---
Isn't 'Savage Gladiator Chain' from BRD arena BIS chest (epic) for hunters? Unless the stats are different from what im thinking
---
Thank you so much for doing this. Well done! 
---
No he's mostly right. There are no mobs above 62 in 5 man dungeons, 5% is the hit cap against 62s
---
102% avoidance on your character sheet (with shield block up) which shows avoidance vs lvl 60 mobs to be uncrushable in raids. I'm not sure if the number is exactly correct, but its close. Shield block will always push crits off the table but you still need a good bit of avoidance for it to push crushing off against a raid boss.
---
Hit definitely doesn't push parry off, you are right about that.
---
For fast vs slow weapons, you need a slow weapon for threat for sure, but in 5 mans with lots of aoe tanking a fast weapon can be better since you can tab around and get hits in faster. It depends what your are doing.
---
"You think Blizzard would be so stupid?!"
---
Yeah, I do. Look what they've been doing to WoW since Wrath.
---
Also, where's the trap? If we still get the same game at the end, what's the difference?
---
Oh yeah! Forgot about that. Yeah fuck dks 
---
&gt;Haha, I was 20+ when I found out cats and bears eat!
---
Waaaa? You can eat and drink in cat/bear form?!
---
I don't think he's outright contrarian. I think circumstance makes him look that way because he's always put in the position to be the blizzard contrarian. He raided with us a couple weeks ago as he got into the new "season" of wow and he was just one of the dorky guys doin goofy ass RP at Rastakan and memeing here and there.
---
This is the answer I came here to give. 
---
I would recommend tailoring for a profession. Its satisfying to make your own gear as you level.
---
hmm, that's not quite the impression I got when I rped. There were some colorful personalities for sure, but I wouldn't described rpers as autistic.
---
Well one thing that happened to me once was that I had a night elf character and somebody got really mad that my name sounded too similar too them. That was the weirdest thing I have experienced with rpers.
---
I feel like they were basically the same as well. There were the BE and Draenei zones, so your 1-20 experience could be very different. But for the most part it was the same experience, sped up a little bit. 
---
First, nothing in that blue post suggests that mechanic was a change. He's just explaining it.
---
Second, there's nothing to prove right or wrong here. This post is entirely based on your personal opinion of how PvP should work.
---
I mean at least the 60 mage tried to exploit the dead zone to cripple his damage. 
---
These were something I really missed when Blizzard redesigned the WoW site. I spent so much time staring at these armor sets on the community site and imaging my characters wearing them one day. 
---
Awesome tool and I'll be taking advantage of that bulk download later. I can't remember if these images existed for T2.5 but if they did, adding them would be a really nice touch. 
---
Tab targeting isn't random, once you get a feel for it you can pretty reliably know how many times to hit tab to land on the target you want. Clicking is still usually better, but don't discount tabing.
---
Warlock pet gets an aoe taunt spell
---
As a warrior i didn't knew there were class quests, i had no defence stand until lvl 20 or something. But i topped this by not using Mortal Strike because it dealt less damage than Heroic Strike - until i figured out that MS is an extra Attack. Oh boy i was terrible
---
This is a very slippery slope and is not something we should condone.
---
The conspiracy is strong with this fella.
---
What do you mean? Priests had Mana Burn and wands. Fight wouldn't last 5 min.
---
You're right about the first part. Nothing in the patch notes at all about any change. But as for second part, any player who played vanilla from the beginning knows that a change WAS made. It was simply never mentioned by blizzard. And it likely will never be. 
---
&gt; They are trying to get as much money out of you as possible
---
They shouldn't have bundled Classic with the subscription then. I would've been suckered into paying $50 for the standalone.
---
Upvote for Faxmonkey
---
I agree your version sounds better for wPvP. Lowbies should be able to group up and defend themselves. 
---
But I would like to know the reason for the change in the first place. Maybe there was a good reason for it that we are not thinking of. Also the honor system would get very complicated if it has to take into account everyone in a fight and who does what damage to who. Might be a performance issue in the end. 
---
No.  We cannot be content with mediocrity.  We cannot compromise on what Classic is.  We had to fight for a decade to even get Classic, and it might be diluted before it even goes live because of these decisions.
---
We must fight tooth and nail to keep it preserved as much as possible.  Because as soon as we give a bit of slack, the pro-change crowd is going to run with it.
---
If the end result is that people get what they want one way or another, how is this a trap?
---
*"Harr harr harr... I'm going to tell this guy that I* ***am not*** *going to give him $1,000, but SURPRISE!  I actually am!  What a fool!*

I played on Kult der Verdammten back in BC. I don't know if this was one of the first RpPvP servers that had opened up, but there were quite some horde rpers (and not just bloodelfs). I can't say much about Alliance side except that we had some open world RpPvP events where we would have a huge battle with the Alliance for Northwatch.
---
To avoid the massive faction imbalance as you described it, it is probably best too have one dedicated RpPvP realm per region. Too many don't make sense since, like I said, rpers will flock to one server with the most rpers, leaving the other ones mostly empty of dedicated rp.
---
I think one large advantage the regular Rp servers had was simply that they were there from launch. So the Rp communities were already present on those servers and would not change to a RpPvP server, leaving them to be glorified PvP realms. If Blizz does not release RpPvP realms at launch, this could very well happen again. Just another reason ro add a RpPvP realm at launch.
---
Oo. Thanks.
---
2 priests mana burning eachother, casting renew, wanding, dispeling, occasionally casting heal or fear... Trust me, if there is a bit of skill on both ends its perpetuum mobile, tested it. Shadow is different story tho, but healing priests duel can take ages.

It's on a long cd though I think. 
---
I was in arathi Highlands as a druid spamming wrath.   Until j met a kind soul that taught me.  Kitty pwn
---
Agree, misleading comparison
---
Anyone looking to get a competitive edge should be using questhelper and a leveling guide. If not a pre-planned route of thier own devising.
---
Anyone looking just to chill out and play the game should follow the directions like "North at the second road, on top of the Western mountain". At least I personally find questing more fun this way. Having recently leveled to the mid-twenties on a faction I am unfamiliar with.
---
I didn't play for 9 years. Got to be honest my test run on alliance (since I love dwarfs in fantasy games).
---
Wasn't exciting or new.  It felt wrong. 
---
But when I logg in to play horde again after 9 years, I expect the Barrens to hit me with much more nostalgia.
---
Of course I can't speak for people who have played wow without a break. Maybe it's the best choice for you guys. 
---
But I'm going back home. 
---
What? Dual wielding shamans are terrible, 2hand windfury 1 shoting shamans are literally the icon of vanilla.
---
This is the margin they have to design raid content for. You want it to be challenging but not soooo challenging that it requires perfect preparation AND perfect execution. Then again, when they designed these raids they didn't know how people would react. 
---
Its not like they could assume that we would all get our shit together and bulldoze on through.
---
They don't view it as, what if Blizz was only going to make PvE servers and PvP may come some time later maybe.  They'd be losing their damn minds.
---
b**LIZ**z**ARD**. My god...
---
I read somewhere that taunt works on hunter pets without triggering neutral guards to attack you. Anyone know if this actually works? I might have to play warrior if it does...
---
Clearly when they say 'share your feedback' they *mean* 'put on a smile and express gratitude'! Whiny baby stuff like requests, complaints, opinions, and recommendations should still be kept to yourself. :P
---
At BlizzCon 2018, we talked about how we plan to keep loot trading in World of Warcraft Classic. We added loot trading in Wrath of the Lich King to solve a common problem: a player could accidentally loot an item meant for another player or give it to the wrong person using Master Loot. They would then have to contact Blizzard to get the item moved to the intended recipient, which might take days. We wanted to keep loot trading in WoW Classic because the end result is the same – the correct person gets the item – and it’ll save everyone time.
---
But we heard your concerns about the potential for abuse of the loot trading system in parties of five. It’s possible that abusive play could take the form of a group of four players colluding to deny loot to a stranger who joined their party as a pick-up. Raid groups, being much larger, come with more understanding on the part of solo players that loot distribution can depend on the whims of the many players and raid leaders who know each other.
---
Taking that into consideration, we’ve decided that the two-hour loot trading system in WoW Classic will only apply to soulbound gear that drops in raids. Soulbound loot that drops in five-person content will not be tradeable at any time. What we hope to do is to strike a balance between saving players time and minimizing the potential for abuse of the system. We think this approach better addresses the concerns we’ve heard from players on the subject.
---
If you started at the end of Wrath, then you started when all tanks had easy AoE threat.  That's not the case in Classic.  In Classic, you will have to figure out how to manage threat on groups of mobs, using techniques such as tab-sunder or knowing when to just chuck it and spam the crap out of Demo Shout.
---
Some specific things you will need to know how to do (and I'm not going to go into details on all of them here):
---
* How to group lead (because then you can call to kill the target you're focusing on)
---
* How to mark targets (what marks are typically used for what CC, how to communicate assignments to the group)
---
* How to generate threat on your primary target to keep the DPS alive and on all other targets to keep the healer alive
---
* How to quickly break CC so you can get back to tanking
---
* How to watch your healer's mana pool to know when to play more conservatively or wait for the next pull
---
There is a lot more communication and coordination going on in Classic than in most of what you'll do in live.  
---
You misunderstood. I only use forwards and backwards with R and F binds.
---
I have camera locked so it will stay wherever I direct it with the mouse.
---
The rest of the spells (most used) have binds,
---
I’ll try strafe but it’s going to be annoying having to switch from R F to W S 
---
In vanilla it was definitely possible to wait 30-60 mins for bg ques. On the server I was on cross realm bgs were received very positively. A lot of people were happy about reasonable que times.
---
I played hardcore vanilla and hated tbc. 
---
Server transfers destroyed my server, at the time best pvp server on earth. 
---
Flying  mount and new continent destroyed world pvp which was my main hobby in wow
---
Vanilla has the best map and best pvp.
---
Tbc had great raids but nothing else.
---
You only think tbc is better cause your a tbc baby and never fully experienced vanilla.
---
RP-PVP servers were the best because people there can write a complete sentence and they aren’t afraid of a fight.
---
Excellent news.
---
Problem solved!
---
Exactly what we asked for. I'm so happy with how Blizzard is handling the feedback. Although I think all loot trading should be out of the game, including in raids, this is a great solution as well.
---
Thank you. Veryhelpful.. 8700k and 2060 looks like the way I'm leaning. Ty!
---
Absolutely nailed it. Nobody can complain here. This is fantastic news.

Wow, they did it. This guy got it right just 7 hours ago:

That's a great compromise position they staked out -- one I saw recommended on this forum many times.

Ahh an alliance warlock with engineering shouldn't have too much trouble vs undead then?
---
How else would I know I'm in a WoW sub?
---
&gt;My only worry is that the pet would not do enough damage to keep mobs off the healer if spreading the damage like that. 
---
If it's an issue, it's going to be an issue with all the pets.
---
&gt; Also it's quite micro intensive which i would likely be awful at to begin with. 
---
Get G600 or equivalent mmo like mouse, save the carpal tunnel on WASD hand.
---
That's a great compromise position they staked out -- one I saw mentioned on this sub many times.
---
Maelstrom declined during/after WotLK. Coming into WotLK, two Alliance guilds left. Before raiding started in WotLK, the third broke up. That meant the top three raiding guilds were gone.
---
Likewise, during/before WotLK, two of the three largest/most active Alliance RP guilds broke up.
---
Maelstrom during BC was fantastic. Totally took a nosedive after that, though.
---
I hope the horde invades duskwood as soon as we land in booty bay.
---
I want the duskwood wars. 
---
&gt;You really think that they are listening to us?
---
Bruh, have a look a the blue post that was put up literally 10 minutes after you posted this.
---
Judgement has lost all it's flavor due to it being the single most overused set ever. Also, Alliance dogs.
---
Aw, but there's even a "free" weekend this weekend!
---
Think that was partially because WOTF was even more nuts on release, think it was 1.6 it got nerfed down from 20 seconds to 5. 
---
I can see you've never worked in a proffesional manner anywhere. 
---
Oh my god thank you
---
This is absolutely the best thing I've read all week
---
THE ABSOLUTE MADMEN! THEY ACTUALLY DID IT.
---
YESSSSSSS!!!!!!!!
---
There has been no indication of TBC servers, so it's not worth talking about as a viable option.
---
If they periodically start fresh realms, it will keep the game fresh for people who want to enjoy a new journey, or for folks who are just becoming involved with classic.
---
There will be players who are content to stay with their t3-progressed toons and continue to play more casually, sort of like how it is on the "Dad server" pserver currently. (Lightbringer, in case you don't know the reference.)
---
&gt; And at midway points: ... Loot Trading ...
---
That dropped today.
---
Somebody will find a reason to complain. 
---
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
---
Where else are you going to put them?
---
Sorry bro. Totally forgot about this. Let me check again since I’m on lunch. 
---
thank yoou kaivax you're the best
---
This seems like a reasonable compromise. It still leaves abuse potential for PUG raids, but this is certainly a positive step. PUG raids are obviously far less common than PUG 5-mans, so I think this will eliminate *most* opportunities for abuse.
---
Thanks for making the cross-post here as well as on the official forums, it's appreciated.
---
Probably going to have to play Warlock just to wear some Felheart one day. Cool tool thanks for sharing!
---
Looks like the old Blizzard is back. The Blizzard that cares about their games and their community. Bravo!
---
It’s been discussed to death.
---
My stance is that vanilla was about the community, and rivalries developed within each realm, and it was especially apparent in BGs.
---
Cross realm BGs affect that negatively, so I don’t want cross realm BGs.
---
Oh hey wow, that's the compromise many here suggested. Kudos to Blizzard. 
---
Different rules regarding naming and harsher rules regarding harassment (disrupting people's rp, like following them and standing on top of them with mounts or similar)  
---
The rp tag in itself attracts people who are interested in this, so flagging realms for rp will draw people who are into that.  
---
In vanilla there was nothing technically seperating rp and rp-pvp, but in current wow, sharding is disabled and cross realms are limited to other rp and rp-pvp servers.
---
Kaivax!!! THANK YOU. Your community interaction and the clarity between us as the community and the developers while gatekeeping the bs away from those obviously busy devs is highly appreciated. Thanks for being such an amazing CM.
---
Boy, have I heard some stories, lmao.
---
I didn't play retail classic but on pservers at least you could have a macro to shift but you'd still have to press it twice. Once to shift out and once to shift back in. 
---
And correct me if I'm wrong but we don't know yet how macros will work in classic. So not sure one button powershifting will be a thing. 
---
Raids where guilds are filling in missing slots and PUG raids, are still affected. But that's still *much* better than also having it in every dungeon. 
---
I normally bind mouse wheel up to pet attack and mouse wheel down to pet passive which usually works. I'm thinking single target tanking with liberal use of cc might be the way to go. 
---
So many t2.5 sets are absolutely garbage compared to other tiers. 
---
Thank you for the easy access text post!
---
Kaivax coming in clutch once again!
---
I completely agree. Only reason I haven't brought it up myself is because I didn't know it was changed. 
---
Well done boys.
---
Yes. In the latest Q&amp;A yesterday Ion mentioned it.
---
You're thinking about TBC aff/sl lock. It was not great in vanilla as you couldnt get high enough in aff tree (and tbc got some awesome talents). You could however play a vanilla hybrid 7/31/13 version.
---
YES
---
Yeah, this is a wow subreddit afterall
---
Jeff Kaplan is still Vice President of the company; even if he’s focused on OW he has a deep understanding of what makes a game fun. There’s still hope yet for Blizzard. Let their games speak for themselves as they have for better or worse. 
---
Yep! Especially for Shadow Priests, wand the last 25% and let Spirit Tap kick in :)
---
It's been a really long time, but wasn't it just, I forget the actual macro, but cancel aura wasn't on the gcd no?
---
Seems like a decent solution, well done.
---
The blue post minutes after this is almost comedic in timing. Lmao. OP gets shat on: the thread.
---
&gt; Nobody can complain here.
---
Oh sweet summer child...
---
Awesome, keep up the good work Kaivax, you’re my hero
---
Oh hai Roy (guessing). It's Balanor.
---
The thing is, I think a lot of people want world PvP in this game to be fun, dynamic, and interesting and they think Classic WoW will bring it. And it will... up until BGs come out. From that moment on, world PvP WILL decline and eventually become virtually non-existant. For two reasons: 1. The level difference drastically reduces chance to hit and 2. There is literally no incentive to do World PvP. The original system shipped with the game at the very least fixed the first main issue but we'd have to have some changes to fix the second..
---
Holy shit I kept these with my current char right up until level 50. And I STILL couldve used it but I moved over to a more tanky pants rather than DPS one.
---
Well, if they actually won't add a RpPvP realm at launch, they lost me as a customer. I already have a guild that plans to go RpPvP and started making friends. Basically the guild could fall apart if there won't be any RpPvP realms and all was for naught.
---
Pls Blizzard, add one RpPvP realm for NA and one for EU. We don't ask for more. It's basically just labeling a realm RpPvP. If you don't have one at launch you basically don't have to add them at all. The communities will be already established and the dedicated Rpers certainly won't switch over to the new RpPvP realm. The reason why Rp servers have been always more popular with Rpers in the early days of WoW could have been solely due to the Rp communities being already established on regular Rp realms. If you don't add RpPvP realms from the start, the same thing is probably going to happen.
---
And that's fine. This happened BECAUSE people complained. If someone still wants to complain then let them, it's all good.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
communism wins...
---
Fair compromise. Would rather it not exist at all, but this is fine I guess. Love the updates they are doing now!
---
I think it's important to let Blizzard know of any concerns because we can't trust them anymore. The feedback is necessary.
---
I remember premades who would make a game with the intention of summoning the boss to fight for us - it would be awesome if enough people are interested in doing this.
---
Just let them fail buddy. You can't fight them at this power level.  
---
Great to see posts like this!
---
Even better after reading quite a few comments this morning about how Blizzard will never listen to the players, etc.
---
Seriously, i came back to this thread just to laugh :P
---
I always enjoyed the 39 ele shaman I made. They get all their needed talents to melt people and have ghost wolf for travel purposes. Plus you can still max eng at 39. Subsequently, I kinda preferred not having mounts because of this class. 
---
To me the 39 bracket is the right blend of lower level strategies with enough viable classes to make it fun. 
---
The biggest bummer is it still takes time to get there. Which is why 19 is always gonna be more popular. 
---
Ah, ok, thought you were a clicker. 
---
But you could always try putting strafe on D and G instead if you are more comfortable with the R F position on the keyboard. I suspect you'd have to move other binds around though but I think you'd benefit in the long run. 
---
Please confirm if this applies to UBRS/LBRS!
---
Happy with the change regardless! 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b46ry6/loot_trading_in_classic/
---
Stickied, and posted by the blizzard poster on our reddit 
---
Pugs wouldn't get gear in a ML situation either.
---
Whoever made this clearly listened to Dr. Who radio shows back in the day, haha
---
Hopefully the word will get around of the corrupt guilds on the server a few months after release so that pugs don’t join guilds who abuse the loot system during raids. 
---
That's true but it's very minimal. Guilds hosting pug raids will reserve the best loot anyway.
---
The only problem i still see is with UBRS raids. UBRS is run as a PuG probably 90% of the time, and there's a lot of insane loot there like rend swords or Felstriker that *could* be abused. But this is obviously great news.
---
Using skull of impending doom to damage myself to break out of CC.
---
You just strafe jump. S key not necessary. 
---
Im sorry but this wand is kinda trash. The 2nd wand you can make with enchanting is better. Then Cookies Stirring Rod and then gravestone scepter
---
ITS NOT HOW IT WAS DURING CLASSIC
---
How flat is the earth again? 
---
(If they don't listen to us, we just continue to use private servers and life goes on. On this rare occasion they don't have a choice) 
---
so now people will roll for there friends in secret and trade it to them during raids... what part of keeping classic classic does blizzard not get. the begging of the end
---
Excellent compromise, I'm really impressed with how seriously they've taken community feedback. 
---
And we're getting so much information lately, here's hoping to a beta announcement or release date soon.
---
Thank your Classic Team for actually listening to your playerbase and providing us with updates !
---
I regret saying it. I can already hear the vocal minority in the distance raising their pitchforks.
---
Feels like its Chrismas every week with all these updates! +1 Blizzard.
---
LFG/LFR killed the community. Removing incentives for 25-man raiding was the nail in the coffin.
---
It's posts like this that make me wanting to keep open discussions. Too many people think existing decisions by Blizzard are final. The only way anything can be changed is if we keep talking about it.
---
Honestly what id love is that, but do like EQ and let fans vote for what’s to be added.
---
And honestly, I’d vote Zandalari playable race EVERY time. It’s the perfect horse race! They are still monstrous but outfits look great on them. 
---
What does it even mean in the context of the news?
---
Classic is really shaping up well, I think right-click report being canned and progressive itemization are the only two requests I really have left, otherwise they've nailed a lot of the decisions they've had to make. The recent announcements and active communication has made me incredibly optimistic for Classic in general, really can't wait.
---
GREAT news! Classic is really shaping up to be absolutely amazing.
---
Haha, *how ever could you tell?*
---
I figured it was you based on the warrior icon, haha.
---
This is incredibly fair and a wonderful compromise. Really happy to hear it and thank you for the update!
---
Had to chime in just to say how amazing and unexpected this is. Thank you Blizzard!
---
His name is Monkeynews. He levels to 60 warrior in about 5 days and destroys PvP. [Here’s a link to his Orc 1-11 speed run] (https://youtu.be/mBlTYBAVXg4), can learn a few things from just this. 
---
Would you even have group loot in a raid? From my pserver experience PUG leaders for MC are usually few and very reputable and if they suck people make sure not to join them. They also have master loot on to collect the materials while puggers come for items.
---
But another thing is ZG where group loot is more common because of the bijous and switching between the loots is easy to forget, so colluding there would be much easier and less noticeable because of the 20 people. 
---
I hope UBRS isn't considered a raid.
---
I mean I’d like modern bells and whistles in classic, but I’d trade the modern shit for not having an endless grind like Azerite.
---
I still think a "Back to loot master" option would be a better solution tbh
---
Just remove loot trading and prevent GMs from reallocating mislooted items lol it’s not that difficult
---
If youre worried about that, then find a guild, especially one that uses loot council.
---
You would :P
---
Exactly my thoughts!  
---
This isn't really a fair graph. How many people who mean retail are likely to specifically search "wow bfa?" Isn't it far more likely that people searching for basic wow would just type "wow?"
---
So yeah, we can clearly see that WoW Classic out trending WoW BfA, but we have no clue how it compares to people - who may not even know Classic exists - simply searching for "WoW."
---
they would not run group loot there fore loot collusion isn't possible, but it resolves all miss loots, like missing who rolled the highest etc
---
This is the perfect solution that many suggested.
---
Its unbelievably comforting and hype that you guys just keep updating us with proof and changes that youre listening and truly care about us, with classic. For example the content-release schedule and this. Just phenomenal work guys. Its not going unnoticed. 
---
Thank you.
---
Yeah you wouldn't be wrong.
---
Eh, that's alright.
---
I should downvote but I I'll upvote in the hope that this is shown in irony next to the recent blue post.
---
What? People have always rolled/used DKP on behalf of others in raids. This just prevents abuse in PUG dungeons.
---
I see he has 1-12 guides...where is the 1-60 in 5 days?
---
Level 59 Druid lmao
---
YEEES
---
I'm loving how much more Classic news we're getting in the past few days. And loving how they're responding to our feedback.
---
Classic beta hype!!! With how fast and furious they are dropping Classic news, I'm hoping a beta announcement comes soon and then an actual release date shortly after. 
---
Yeah I'm with you all, it's probably the minimum interference possible. 
---
Pretty sure UBRS is and will be considered a 10 man dungeon, not a 10 man raid
---
Really, these minor details don't bother me at all.

Exactly.

Unarmored mounts is the next talking point on my personal agenda! :D

NO CHANGES /s

Huge, actually.

Niceeee

Plebs could never get through heroic Shattered Halls, Sethekk Halls or Shadow Labs. I considered those places a true test of skill &amp; teamwork that set people apart. I enjoyed the challenge of being at the top of my game to complete these heroics. LK heroics were hollow in comparison.
---
The kind of high quality of this sub is sorely lacking.
---
All aboard the hype train! Summer can't get here any faster!
---
# Choo choo!
---
Great news! One of the side benefits of allowing loot trading in raids is that raid leadership can loot the gear and keep the raid progressing while the person that will get the gear is determined.
---
&gt; But as for second part, any player who played vanilla from the beginning knows that a change WAS made.
---
This is an absurd claim. I played pretty heavily throughout all of vanilla, but I have no idea if there was a change to PvP hit tables. That was over 15 years ago. 
---
I never really worried about this for big raids or 5-mans. Just for UBRS, pretty much. You should still look out for shady play in UBRS with these rules. 
---
Ganking lowbies is very mature! 
---
Whats the difference between a PVP world and a RP-PVP world?
---
Could be, would be nice if they clarified that. They specifically write "5 person content" in that post, suggesting that 10/15 man content will have loot trading.
---
BLIZZARD CATERING TO PEOPLE CRYING IS WHAT RUINED WOW AND THEY CONTINUE TO DO SO WHAT THE F... 
---
Something of that nature 
---
Nice compromise, Blizz!
---
Holy smokes what?
---
The SOLE situation remaining for you to complain about is:
---
1. PUG raid
---
2. using need or greed for some reason instead of master looter
---
3. wherein multiple players of the same class happen to be friends
---
4. where, say, t1 shaman shoulders drop, and shaman A needs them, but shaman B doesnt, and somehow, shaman B rolls for it
---
5. and shaman b wins
---
6. and the entire pug group DOESN'T explode in rage that the dude wearing t2 shoulders just rolled on t1 shoulders he obviously doesn't need
---
And.. that very specific, far fetched scenario, leads to "this game won't be classic at all?"
---
This was fixed in 1.12 along with Sword Spec. I think I still have a screenshot of the combat log with SS proccing on itself like 5-6 times, good times but OP AF.
---
I don't think Blizzard makes any differentiation based on what instance you're running. Anything &gt; 5 people would be a raid group and the raid group loot rules would apply.
---
Now, there probably isn't anything technically stopping them from making loot trading not apply to loot in UBRS, but I don't expect that to be the case.
---
Should be, but I would love to see some clarification.
---
#NOCHANGE
---
I was generally against Loot Trading but remembering all those time that our clumsy Guild Leader miss-cilcked put me on the fence because I still remember that back in Wotlk we were quite happy to get that change.
---
It's still true however that this wasn't the same for 5 men, or should I say, random parties. With a guild group, loot trading would still be fine because of missclicks (although very often this lead to people making jokes, "haha, I will ninja this... you want it back? Beg for it!). It's definitely not the same for random parties though, as even leaving aside friends and strangers... even in party of full strangers you can make a pact with someone from which both of you would benefit. 
---
The result of people abusing the system is that their name will go to shit on the server. This is a community effect and what we want in Classic. They should get infamous and lose their chance to join a good guild.
---
They can watch two fairly popular pservers and see the population progression.
---
One is butchering the itemisation, introducing updated R13 gear a month into the server progression and WSG/AB gear from the start and do other shitty things.
---
They had 10k players in the beginning and dried up to 500 pop max in about half a year.
---
The other one is prospering with 150.000 individual accounts logging in over the cause of a week.
---
The same applies here. If they fuck up and implement too many shitty aspects, people wille abstain and play something else.
---
This happens all the time.
---
BF5 shit? Guess people play Apex Legends, RDR2  etc. Game developers are not invincible nowadays. People do *not* suck everything up, they just don't pay and don't play for the product.
---
Nice. Classic dev team got this shit.
---
i prefer the caps tbh
---
**#BRINGBACKPINKSHAMANS**
---
It has more Stam and +defense early on
---
I just came
---
They're not the same at all. The problems with Classic are not gameplay-related and a lot easier to fix. Fixing something like azerite armor, which is the main progression system of the expansion is a lot harder because they actually have to come up with something totally new and implement it - which they're doing in 8.2.
---
Titanforging is not a problem for the majority of the playerbase, so there's nothing really to fix. They already greatly reduced its chance since Legion, but they're not gonna scrap the system because it makes more content relevant in the game.
---
n1 blizzard, keep'em coming!
---
&gt; potential for abuse of the loot trading system in parties of five.
---
Yeah. I wouldn't call UBRS a raid. Although it is a *raid group* and not a "party of *five*" as written in OP. I hope that UBRS indeed wont have loot trading.
---
I've made a lot of posts about this, but TLDR : People were forced to play Resto in group content because Feral was completely unsupported by the game for most of its existence. Patch 1.8 gave us Innervate baseline. That came out in 2006. Vanilla came out in 2004. Many other itemization updates and small balance tweaks continued to improve Druids in every patch until Burning Crusade came out.
---
Imagine playing a Druid for over a year and suddenly Feral \*might \* be viable, if you happen to have the gear. Are you really going to tell everyone you play with to fuck off so you can experiment? Probably not. Although 0/30/21 was much more popular at that point it - gave you just enough points to raid heal while letting you play like a Bear in PvP and solo content.
---
We don't have that problem. It's 1.12 from day one. Feral is completely supported and we know that it's incredible. There are still going to be douchebags who want you to heal because healing is an essential role, but you don't want to be in their groups anyway. They're not  trying to make the best group possible. They just want any healer so they can get started.
---
Here's the flaw. Basically none of the original people behind what made warcraft and early wow great are still at Blizzard. Couple that with the fact that Activision has severely interfered with all Blizzard IPs and focused the company in an entirely different direction.
---
If it was still the same company, I would agree with you. But I genuinely would not consider Pre 2011 WoW and the Warcraft series to be an IP of the current Blizzard/Activision.
---
"WoW" is way more popular than osrs. Even searching "bfa" shows it as more searched than classic. 
---
I do still like the idea of trading having to go through the ML (so a player can select an item to send 'back' to the ML to redistribute), but i DEFINITELY wont complain about this.  Its a great middle ground, and in the vast majority of raid situations will work very well.
---
S
---
Tips and Esfand are going to have heart attacks before launch.  Their boners are so huge right now.
---
Shamans can't dual wield in vanilla anyway.
---
I meant similar to how it was in retail vanilla, in the sense they got replaced by the armored versions. A lot of people around here want the unarmored versions in the game for the entirety of classic, and that would lame.
---
I didn't get the unarmored version during retail vanilla, and I started in Nov 04, haha. Pretty sure I didn't buy an epic mount until I hit rank 11 for the uber cheap warhorse. I think they were changed in April 05, so 5 months after release, coulda been May, Idk.
---
Lots of us shamans are looking to play 2h again.  I had a friend that had sulfuras and full raid gear, his power  was insane.  If blizzard continues to refuse us this pleasure I'll be sad.  DW enhancement is garbage and I hope they don't try to force it on us.  
---
It will be ok that windfury doesn't stack in 1.12, it can still do massive damage and is still an absolute blast to play! 
---
&gt;Anti-social, anti-semitic, maga, racist and sexist talk in /world is not "internet culture". 
---
i mean, like it or not... yeah that's a part of internet culture. the dumber part, but a part nonetheless.
---
&gt;It's a cancer that has been established and spread on inter-regional p-servers due to a clash of cultures, beliefs, merits and worldviews.
---
i'm guessing you didn't play vanilla then. the only difference between the chat in vanilla and the chat in pservers is that blizzard actually moderated vanilla chat.
---
inb4 someone just shouts NOCHANGE
---
Yeah, that guy and everyone else that said it should only be in raids. Some of which have been saying that for months.
---
0 to 7.5 is warcraft 3 my friend. Who would hear about wow if not for that amazing game? Sure, maybe you'd pick it up few years later when people tell you its cool. 
---
Sadness. The bug was there when they released shaman for alliance. Guess somehow the fix was not applied to the other faction. Weird. 
---
I know, what I mean is that Blizzard should have just left them with 2 hands when TBC came.
---
Damn, the cadence of these updates, how many has that been in the past month, like 5? 6?
---
holy shit.. a game company that is finally listening to the consumer base!
---
Well the former is never going to have open rolls. The latter will still probably use master loot because pugs are typically run by a small guild group looking for certain materials.
---
If it's a true pug and open rolling is used then hopefully the threat of you and your friends being kicked and blacklisted (the pug raid scene tends to get the same people creating/running the raids) for abusing loot trading is enough to deter people.
---
But you will see who rolls for items so its easy to see who is a ninja. And if a raid leader consistently allows that then the guild will soon be called out.  I mean raids can already be abused since normally raid leaders decides who gets to roll if there even is a roll. That problem was in classic already. 
---
Catch-up mechanics in LK were ridiculous. You could ding max level and be completely ready ready to walk into current tier raiding a week later. It really damages the epic-ness of raiding when obtaining good gear takes very little time commitment or skill.
---
When I managed to get top-quality gear in TBC, it required  a lot of time &amp; effort, and I felt like a fucking god. It also required me to be a team player and use social skills to work as a member of a guild that was able to work as a team so we could all obtain the goals that we were after.
---
Sigh, blizz giving into 4 year old cry babies.
---
Yeah it's like that way anytime you get a solid 2h weap upgrade, like Corpsemaker around level 30 or Might of Mograine at level 40.  A paladin is very similar to a warrior rogue or shaman, your strength while leveling is heavily dependent on your weapon.  A level 40 warr with a level 30 blue weapon is WAY weaker than a level 40 warr with a level 40 blue weapon.  Whereas a level 40 mage with a level 25 staff is pretty much the same as a level 40 mage with a level 35 or 40 staff, just minor differences
---
People are already arguing over whether UBRS is a raid or not lol.
---
Shamazing!
---
Actually the quote is
---
&gt;will only apply to soulbound gear that drops in raids 
---
This suggests it's based on weather or not the classify UBRS as a raid.
---
I'd like more clarification on how they will be treating UBRS, but otherwise I'm very happy with this solution.
---
./ join Blackmarket WTS Rejuv Gem. PST best offer

At level 30, I played countless skirmishes in southshore/tarren mill and my "job" as a mage was to sheep the enemy healers, all of whom were skulls to me. Rarely did I get a resist. This is after diminishing returns was introduced so I knew I couldn't CC them indefinitely but it was the general lack of resistances that I remember distinctly. Since virtually all of the enemy players were far higher level then I was, this was one of the few things I could do and actually be useful. 
---
By patch 1.12, I wouldn't even bother trying since it was virtually guaranteed that they would resist everything I tried. And, even by that time, world PvP was already on its way out and was only really interesting in STV or Tanaris. 
---
People grind primals all time in outland. What were you doing ma friend if not going those places
---
There is no DW shamans in vanilla.
---
"Obviously this particular thread didn't age too well".meme
---
Leveling as feral is going to be a lot faster. Also there isn't any level where balance gets significantly better, you may be thinking of ele shaman. The higher level the druid is the worse balance is compared to feral because feral has so many great talents.
---
Well the community seems pretty vocal about wanting RpPvP realms. This should give them a strong indication that the demand is there.
---
Tbf, it has happened that the somewhat misfunctioning mouse of the RL malfunctioned and the item that hasnt dropped for months and months got assigned to the wrong person. 
---
Or you finally kill a boss after 7 hours of raiding and everybody was tired. Mistakes happen, even on pservers with severely lacking GM support raid items get restored, because everybody knows how shitty it can be to wrongly assign a binding to a mage.
---
I'm glad they go with loottrading in raids.
---
While I can't remember if it did work one way over the other way back then (my memory doth bloweth mightely).  I do agree that it should work where lowbies can hit higher levels.
---
I played DAoC for many years.  It did work that way there (and still does as far as I know.)  Nothing was more satisfying as being in a mob of lowbies and taking out a ganker, or being able to run with a mob of higher levels and at least feeling like you're helping (and getting RPS for being able to hit them was nice as well.)
---
One of my favorite memories was fighting in a pvp dungeon with a group of 4 friends.  We had a stealther come up and hit us.  He missed his opener.  He was purple con to us (skull to WoW standards).  We fought hard and I was on a class that could both heal and poison.  My heals were weak...my poison was not.  He got confused as my poison ticked away and my group mates hit him as I healed my best.  3 of the 4 died, but we got him!  My poison tick was the last thing that hit him and I got the kill spam, followed by a spam of congratulatory tells.
---
The problem in classicwow comes into whether it did indeed work that way.  If it didn't, we run across no changes (or minimal to keep the feel of classic.)  If it did, we have to compare to the target patch level and go from there.
---
Xp boost to lvling was introduced in tbc. 10-20% IIRC
---
It is a raid group.
---
A shitpost on r/classicwow to stoke retail vs classic fires? I can't believe it. 
---
Thank you for *continuing* to listen to your future player base, Blizzard. We’re all every excited in the direction you’re taking this game. Can’t wait for more news!!
---
Do people recommend switching? All I've seen is that chicken is massively gimped in vanilla and you should level feral the whole way - and that you can still heal dungeons as a feral spec, just keep some SP/Int gear. That's what I'm planning on doing.
---
It was easy with all the evidence Blizz provided
---
well done chums
---
It’s ok to complain about things. It’s not ok to complain about all the things.
---
You get it
---
For a addiction machine BfA did a pretty bad job. I think only WoD drove away more people.
---
It wasn’t in 1.12 right? I would imagine we’ll get the 5 man version of it?
---
I can hope.
---
I LOVE the solution, but I wonder what UBRS will classified as.  
---
NOT a complaint, I'd just like some more clarity on the line drawn.
---
kaivax is on fire
---
&gt; non-hardcore to compete (slightly) against the hardcore in the honor rankings 
---
You have to explain that one for me. 
---
I would have paid extra.
---
Classic is an MMO experience I've searched for and have yet to find again.
---
Decent. Keep it up.
---
Savage Gladiator wasn't added until 1.11 when they added the 0.5 sets. 
---
Hello fellow ED player! Was alliance on that server, did RP, did massive WPVP. Good times. 
---
It was a good discussion, but at the end of the day, cheesy AVs were absolutely vanilla, just as prenerf AVs were.  So at this point it's a quibble- which part of vanilla WoW was better?  
---
Similar with cross realms, which I think are more important because they affect the entire BG system.  I think Blizzard is very worried about how they are going to handle player populations in general, because of the reasonably silly decision to allow anyone with an active WoW subscription to join up vanilla.  It would be like any other MMO launching with free access for WoW players for some reason- it will totally screw up the initial land rush on servers.  Because Blizzard has for years solved these problems by adding more abstraction and subtracting server identity and borders, those are the tools they have- so I suspect we'll see cross realm BGs for that reason.
---
If you're serious about PVP then engineering is the profession you need, it just provides too many options and does to much to fill gaps in your kit. This is true for every class but especially for warlocks who can potentially depend on the bombs as mentioned and really appreciate the movespeed from rocket boots they otherwise lack.
---
Your keyboard will be weeping at all the keybinds you'll need as a warlock engineer though :)
---
Poor dude with a zero vote was right.
---
Thanks for the heads up! How about UBRS? Is it going to be considered a dungeon or a raid in this context?
---
Very disappointed. Loot trading was in vanilla via GM tickets. Now you can't fix mistakes anymore. Thanks crybabies.
---
Gorilla is horrible for AoE tanking.  It's ability has a 1 minute CD, which means you can't use it much.
---
I can't remember that. I only really remember doing 10-15 mans.
---
I played since beta. During Vanilla I played on an RP-PVE (60 Alliance), PVP (60 Alliance) and an RP-PVP Realm (45 Horde). So I know both sides especially old barrens chat. Although the channels were under moderation I never ever experienced the amount of toxicity and "dumber part" of "internet culture" you can see on private servers these days-
---
The WoW Classic servers will probably not be heavily moderated so I hope it will be "better" on RP-PvP or RP-PvE realms.
---
UBRS is my main concern. I don't want it classified as a raid in this case, even though it technically is. 
---
I can live with this.
---
I don't get it, why not just remove the feature in general? This still leaves UBRS and Pug raids easily abusable.
---
Yeah ninja looting was a part of the community flavor, made villains and enjoyable forum drama, but oh well
---
It will 100% be the vanilla system, where you rank to 14. Anything other than that would probably kill classic, and for good reason too.
---
Afaik, all they have said about the honor system is:
---
&gt; "We haven’t yet determined exactly when phases 2-6 will occur, and PvP content is notably missing from the list above. That’s because we’re still evaluating our options regarding PvP rewards, as they also changed over time (both in power and in terms of which PvP reward items were available)."
---
[Source.](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-content-plan/120346)
---
I started late in vanilla, February 2006, I swear I remember doing UBRS with just 5 though. 
---
Yep, I never got the chance to be healer in classic, how was shaman for healing then? I just remember loving earth shield. 
---
So how can druids heal in instances while lvling? Just keeping caster set on inventory or something?
---
Also, I don’t like feral since I’ve mained rogue for years and much prefer it.
---
I might just lvl up the Druid and keep it as farmer or healer since balance doesn’t really seem like a viable option :( even though I prefer priest as healer XD
---
Yea he does a good job.
---
Oh look, another non classic feature being implemented in “classic”. 
---
Nothing will generate enough AoE threat for dungeons unless you overlevel it.  A bird with Screech is going to be the best you can get.
---
Gorillas have a 1 minute CD and so it will be painfully slow, if not impossible.
---
I mean, people that liked loot trading because it's more authentic to vanilla are probably upset. People that liked the forgiving and helpful nature of vanilla. The #nochanges crowd should be upset but somehow is happy? I really don't understand this sub sometimes.
---
What about the lvl 58 Warlock? :)
---
Yes battleshout deals more AoE threat than Demo shout, Demo shout is Flat threat across all mobs where as Battle is flat per member hit so if you had a party of five and two of those are hunters your battleshout would give 55 threat x7 across all aggro'ed mobs.
---
Tanking as Arms and or fury will be fine till UBRS. General Drakkisath is the only boss in there that will give you any problems tanking as Arms/Fury which you can just OT just fine.
---
Scholo/BRD/Strat UD and even DM :W/E are more than fine to tank as either spec, Strat Living will give you some trouble purely for the fact that mobs hit like trucks but nothing some CC can't fix. 
---
You want a fast weapon at **all times,** This means tanking with a dagger for a very long time. There is a reason why people use Thunderfury till and through naxx and it isn't because of the proc that is just an added bonus.
---
Now you're probably thinking, But a dagger has shit damage and i'll look like an idiot, It is simple **Rage.** 
---
Rage is Threat, More rage means more shield blocks the more you're blocking the more rage you generate meaning more threat.
---
levelling is completely up to you, All of a Warriors spec are viable to level with however Fury With a 2 hander is more optimal to level as till 40 at which you swap to Arms. Early fury talents are better than Arms giving you more Crit,More rage generated on swings, Enrage ( once you're crit you deal % more damage ) and faster attack speed on a critical attack. 
---
Anymore questions feel free to ask.
---
This has to be trolling. Well played.
---
I kinda feel like this is dumb. Blizzard specifically asked the community to make noise on stuff like this. If we feel they are wrong. Very few people, on here are Anti-Blizzard. They are anti-retail. As far as some people going to far with criticisms this is the internet. No barrier to entry. No good way to sort out the anti-socials. Gonna have to deal with it brah.
---
But they are doing exactly what I said. They want to create that illusion that they are listening to us when all along loot trading was never going to be in Classic.
---
I have been a raid leader, I have been a raid member, and I have also been one of those "severely lacking GM" on a private server.  The fact remains when you kill a boss you have no idea what will drop, if you lose one item a YEAR this way why is it such a big deal.  I see items looted incorrectly maybe once or twice a year, because the ML has that job because they are competent and paying attention.  
---
Players create the problem, players deal with the consequence, just like every aspect of the game.  You get corpse camped for 3 hours? your fault for not winning or changing character or GY rezzing.
---
We gucchi boys.
---
So just get a raiding guild in classic and your fine in raids
---
&gt;soulbound loot that drops in five-person content will not be tradeable at any time
---
 stutter stepping better than most hunter on retail and private servers nowadays cool
---
I thought it could always be done with 5 but usually wasn't because people weren't geared enough at the start for it.
---
Mother. of. god. They've done it.
---
So you cant counter my point of view so I am trolling?   
---
Just keep a secondary set of gear with int/spirit and you can heal all dungeons while leveling.
---
Hillsbrad.  Stonetalon Mountains and Ashenvale are also pretty popular.
---
Yes it is? If people want to complain then let them. That's how you actually have a healthy forum. If the game is great then there won't be that much complaining.
---
In ZG all 20 people are normally required to sit in Disc even though most do not talk, they only need to listen to commands.
---
If the lead genuinely forgets to put in ML, one can just quickly throw that in in comms and in all cases in which it was a genuine mistake, the ML changed it when I joined pug raids.
---
Lmfao chill out. There are plenty of reasons to not trust them still (especially outside of classic). 
---
Gorilla will break sheeps.
---
Alexensual LUL
---
What about Truestrike Shoulders tho
---
Dat gear overlap tho. Pally / Lock seems good too. Both also get free mounts. 
---
Yeah I have to admit, I'm pleasantly surprised. Blizzard has genuinley been listening and it's really made me gain confidence in them
---
So a useful feature that has been in the game since day 1 through current retail is now removed because of people crying about a hypothetical boogeyman. Great job everyone!
---
Not exactly. I simply give up, it's not worth it.
---
Hey you are right. Tbc was far from perfect, but better game? Anyday. My main point is that game was ruined by separation, "expansions" instead of patches. And the whole ideology behind it. 
---
What i mean is tbc is hotter new gf that had so many bad traits removed, however once in a lifetime chance was missed on helping old gf deal with her issues. 
---
I found out that Threat is actually a mechanic and not just some stupid RP crap, and that my pet's Growl ability was actually useful.  *I didn't know about the group-focused mechanics, I was coming into this game having played FPS games, and games like Diablo 2, Ocarina of Time, and Starcraft.  In those games, aggro is based solely on proximity.*
---
Classic WoW devs are killing it.
---
Hunter + healer. 
---
It's 2 man 3 role party. Even 4 (double dps) if it's healer in dps spec. 
---
This is one of the weirder posts I've ever seen!
---
First: The post is about spell hit %, while you seem to be talking about general hit %. Melee weapons were always and have always been governed by your weapon skill vs. targets defense skill.
---
Second: As pointed out by another poster, you have no evidence whatsoever that a change was made or that at any point, a lowbie could consistently hit a higher level target with their spells. You cite solely your own recollection that you were able to "consistently" sheep ?? enemies while raging in Tarren Mill. But enemies are ?? at what.. +8 levels? So even then, you may have been landing a fair number of your sheeps.. but they probably weren't level 60s
---
Third: Assuming you are talking only about spell hit %, which is the only topic in the blue post you mentioned, making your proposed change would essentially result in a MASSIVE buff to casters and a MASSIVE nerf to melee in world pvp. Downranking spells was very common for all classes because mana costs got absurd with your level 60 ranks of spells. If you let a level 40 mage have their 80/85% chance to hit against a level 60 warrior.. suddenly the level 40 mage is a very legitimate threat, casting spells doing nearly the same damage a level 60 mage would probably be hurling.
---
Why on earth should a level 30 be able to hit a level 60? Thats the whole point of levelling up. A level 60 has like at least 3x the amount of time in their character. They SHOULD resist your level 30 spells.
---
‘Compromises’ like this without understanding the effects are exactly what led away from Vanilla’s design.  
---
I think that due to the nature of principles, it’s actually impossible for Blizzard to return to Vanilla using its modern team.  This is a good instance showing how unavoidable changes are.
---
I suppose the ONLY way to really return to the original design is if the operating principle were traditionalism for the sake of tradition; then they’d be willing to implement classic even without understanding its design.
---
Before you this game, I was addicted to counter strike, de_dust booya!
---
Ye with the need greed system is is quite clear cut you need stuff you are going to use and greed stuff you are going to sell, goes for all classes. And yes i agree simply talking about certain pieces is a real winwin situation for everyone (:
---
Haha yes! 
---
Are you new to the internet? People that moan about everything are in no way contributing to a healthy forum. 
---
Constructive criticism is fine. Constant moaning isn’t.
---
No reason not to have strafing keys. 
---
I wonder if there will be an armoury in classic. If so you'd be able to see if that hunter rolling for the t1 shoulders is wearing it 2h later or he's all the sudden wearing t2 shoulders. Granted, it would be quite hard to discover if you didn't have a suspicion from the start.
---
He hasn’t posted one. Just the 1-12 and the Human one. 
---
Because people complain all the time, we got an easy game which is retail wow.
---
So what if u all need in a dungeon and write a ticket to move the item to another player? 
---
 Karazhan still my favorite raid.
---
As I predicted after the announcement of 6 phase content : loot trading will be raid only.
---
My next prediction will be right-click reporting.
---
It will either be removed entirely in Classic, or a GM will actually CHECK the reports before squelching a player.
---
Most likely it will be the first one : ain't going to be a right-click reporting in Classic.
---
Paladin set balances out the other set’s crappyness tho 
---
&gt; This is what happens when people complain and make a fuss about something. Things actually get solved.
---
Echo that. Though I'd like to think I'm 'adamantly insisting on doing things correctly' rather than fussing or complaining ;-P
---
I am pretty sure it will be considered a 10/15 (probably 10 as 1.12) dungeon, as it doesnt have a lockout like raids.
---
I notice you didnt suggest a better option.
---
Not trying to be a dick here: how do we know he has done warrior 1-60 in 5 days on a non-modded private server? That’s an insane feat
---
nice, i'm real pleased with this
---
I think you have a great solution on hand - I just figured I'd ask about this. Not sure if it's feasible from a programming standpoint.
---
Just like the group leader has the option to change loot systems (need before greed, master loot, etc), is it possible to toggle the loot system to soulbound / 2 hr trade system for the current instance? Figure that setting is preserved on first instance-lock?
---
Just a question, really. I think your solution is great and should really cut down on requests / solve the majority of issues.
---
Cheers!
---
I like it 
---
Great news, very subtle solution and one we saw spring up on this sub a few times - Love it. 
---
Nice. :)
---
I've been on reddit for 7½ years dude. The best forums were ones where people didn't get angry about complaining. Constant moaning always means there's an issue.
---
&gt;Although the channels were under moderation I never ever experienced the amount of toxicity and "dumber part" of "internet culture" you can see on private servers these days. 
---
that's what im saying. blizzard *will* ban people for the slightest insensitive thing, especially 2019 blizzard. back then people only got banned for spamming and n****. now? i expect many more things will be reportable.
---
&gt;It was more about Chuck Norris and "your mom" jokes.
---
right. and what's wrong with that? is rp-pvp server really necessary because people can't tolerate stupid unoriginal jokes from people that are just trying to have fun? are people really *too mature* for such things, while simultaneously playing a 16-year-old children's game?
---
if you want to pvp, just play a pvp server. or if you do enjoy the rp aspects, that's fine too -- play rppvp. but there's no reason to be all high and mighty about maturity and how you're better than "one of those *try-hard* (as if that's an insult) **pvpers**".
---
Excellent. Thank you Blizzard. Me gusta. 
---
Either way, we win so whats the problem?
---
I think he its means Soul link/Nightfall 
---
Well now I’m gonna have to make that much more gold to bribe players for gear. :)

Found this post agreeing that, at one time, Vanilla WoW DID allow low level players to get hits off on much higher level players:

---
Loving the more frequent updates :D. im really looking forward to this
---
Possibly. I was going with the thought that anything above 5 man is considered a "raid" even if it's not a true 20-40 man raid.
---
Super fair compromise, thumbs up 
---
I dig it 
---
Wow this is actually a pretty good compromise. Seems the Classic dev team is really listening.
---
I dont think its considered a raid, as you can reset it and run it over and over again, which you cant with a raid. I see it as a 10/15 man dungeon.
---
a 30-60 minute queue time for a bg is typical when you're queueing for an off-weekend bg, during valley hours of the day, or solo queueing certainly. The norm on a well populated server? I think not.   
---
The compromise to fill those gaps is the lack of experiencing a meaningful battle against the opposing faction. I played on Illidan horde, and when people saw Superpally on the other side of the battle, It was fucking on. He was horde's public enemy number one and just that one name changed the experience entirely. Imagine being on the same realm as swifty and you get into game as his team mate? You look at him in inspiration and awe, and know that there's hope for a win.   
---
When you remove experiences like that, then whatever content you participate in is reduced to another grind for some loot or rank. It's the same effect as dungeon finder and LFR. You're removed from your server's community another degree until there's not a trace of it left, and you're just another grind junky not participating in anything but your stats. This is what we're fighting against. We've been rallying together to bring back the old way, the best way, so that our beloved game gives us more of what we really crave. I beg you not to sacrifice this on the alter of accessibility.
---
I can’t believe you’re making all of these good decisions. 😭😭😭 I’m so hopeful for this game now, you guys are fucking amazing for listening.
---
&gt; This suggests it's based on weather or not the classify UBRS as a raid. 
---
Not even close.
---
This suggest ANY content that is a RAID group. Any content with more than 5 people is raid content.
---
Not ideal, but I'm glad they did this much.  I hope to not have to pug raids anyway.
---
Thanks Kaivax and team! This is going to take all the potential fear out of joining a group; the entire 'will they conspire' question is gone. 
---
If only the retail team was HALF as responsive to the community as the classic team...
---
I'm glad blizzard read my post and applied it exactly as I wrote it.

---
Smh @ the people arguing in my thread against it with no evidence besides their own emotions and "no changes" blinders on.
---
I am sick of repeating this: A group of people actively working together to gear an individual is not a pug in any way, shape or form.
---
Hotfix inc
---
All of those summons are present, the matches can be long if you crash into their raid with your raid and don’t choose to avoid each other and base race.
---
That’s completely up to the players.
---
Yes. That didnt change until the cross realm shit. Length of match is determined by how much everyone turtles. I suspect the days long matches won't happen though 
---
Bois, at this rate we're gonna get EVERYTHINGGGGGGGG we want
---
Loot trading was not in vanilla wow at all. If anything this a step closer to authentic vanilla. 
---
&gt; that has been in the game since day 1
---
That awkward moment when you're posting about a WOTLK feature as being in since "day 1" in /r/classicwow
---
I'm glad you didn't live through LFR Cataclysm. That experience makes anyone understand how to abuse loot trading gear up your guild with bonus rolls.
---
TM vs SS is one of the few things I'd be willing to no-life rush to 60 for instead of taking the slow scenic route.
---
If you convert the group to a raid, then its a raid group. My money is on this affecting UBRS
---
Gear overlap isn't bad, priest wants int spirit, warlock wants stam int. 
---
I didn't take screenshots of every item obviously, but there a bunch of things in there that bring back some good memories.
---
From testing that others have done, Mage + Mage is by far the best.  Their playstyle is vastly different from each other, and if you were to combine Mage + Hunter, for example, the Mage would basically be carrying the hunter.  
---
However, you can virtually combine anything with anything and make things better.  Even a mage will see some benefit in grouping with another player.  Maybe not in AoE grinding, but in particular dealing with casters or dealing with places where mages don't excel on their own (such as against frost-immune mobs or in tight spaces).  
---
If your class has a high margin for error, you can really help out something squishy, and if you have a lot of DPS you can really speed up a slow-and-steady partner.  On the other hand, a pair of tanky/healy players can overpull quite a bit, or a glass cannon duo can nuke things before they even reach you.
---
Some strategies to consider:
---
1. Mage + Mage *(as mentioned above)*
---
2. Spriest + Warlock for massive amounts of DoT cleave.
---
3. Hunter + DPS, where the hunter takes the tank + healer role, and the other DPS will make things die faster.  *(It could even be another hunter)*
---
4. Tank + DPS.  It could be a Warrior, but it could also be a Druid, Paladin, or Shaman.  Maybe even a Warlock (VW or drain tank) or a combat Rogue.  One person gets the focus of the mob so the other person can DPS from behind (if melee) or without being interrupted (if ranged).
---
5. Healer + DPS.  Ideally the DPS would be melee, but a caster can work.  The other person primarily heals so there's less downtime.
---
6. Tank + Healer.  Slower, but you can pull more mobs and you can find groups easy.
---
7. Dual Melee.  If you can attack from behind you do more damage, if you pull aggro your partner can attack from behind.
---
8. Dual Range.  If you play it really well you may be able to triangle kite.
---
There's 79 possible duo class combinations, and they all should offer a different dynamic.
---
When did I say that? I don't understand who you're sick of repeating things to.
---
Clearly what I'm saying is, if I join up with four other people and we all seemingly don't know each other, I'm going into that thinking it's a PUG. However, if two of those people are friends and are rolling on gear to feed it back and forth later, well, yeah, they're not PUGing, but the implication to me and the two other people not in on the scheme certainly think we're in a PUG.

---
You’re going to get both.
---
It is now known by pserver, retail, and former players that the easiest way to play AV is to skip PVP (in the middle, at least). Most games will probably be an attempt to go straight for the mid-boss, towers, and/or just the final boss.
---
Some games, however, will descend into chaos and turn into mid-turtles. Those will be your long, HK-farming games. 
---
They planned it all along!! Loot trading wasn't in Vanilla, why would it be in Classic if they are trying to provide an "authentic vanilla experience" ?? It never made sense of them saying that loot trading will be in Classic, its a contradictory statement.
---
It is kind of funny that /BringTheHammerD0wn thought you got shat on when, if anything, the Blue post affirmed your theory. 
---
Not that I fully believe it but there *is* some potential that they've planned to do things correctly all along but are letting the player base stay nervous and talkative. It would be good marketing to do exactly what they've done to garner good will. 
---
Do we need to wake up to it? Meh. I don't care much. A bit of stress thinking they were going to bungle it that they could have alleviated a year ago by releasing their plans but it keeps me engaged and, in the end, it looks like they're actually going to release a good product. 
---
Removing this as a repost, since the blue (Kaivax) posted it before you did. Just trying to consolidate conversation, sorry!
---
Clarification for uldaman and lbrs would be needed too since both those have a 10 man limit but is usually treated as 5 man instances. 
---
&gt; You like WoW? Better head to the forums to learn more about the game you like...oh wait it's just people bitching about everything.
---
THIS
---
Every PUG raid I've been in has specific loot rules, and was on master-loot. I can't attest to other people's experience. But for me, this was the standard. 
---
Sorry for not answering this but I'd also really like to know. It may determine if I play hunter or rogue 
---
Cool tell me more about how LFR in cataclysm makes a feature in Vanilla that you've always been able to accomplish bad.
---
No, UBRS was a 10 man (originally 15) there is likely nothing stopping you from attempting it with 5, but I don’t remember how easy that would have been back then.
---
This is not a good idea.
---
Raids are pugged all the time. 
---
No changes is the only path
---
Great news
---
It’s a game for 12 year olds man
---
Is UBRS a raid or dungeon? Is there a blizzard confirmation on which it is considered?
---
Anyone actively looking to abuse loot mechanics to gear a specific person can do so infinitely more successfully with master looter.
---
Appreciate the insight, obviously it’s been awhile since I’ve been in there lol 
---
Wait, it won't be 15 like in classic?
---
Please continue 
---
Don't get me wrong, this is a step in the right direction but the biggest problem wasn't going to be in the dungeons but in the raids themselves. In any rolling system, loot council, DKP whatever you're always going to get the message "Can I buy that?". It's not in the spirit of the game at all and something like this will cause problems in the future with people buying gear and rolling for others to trade in raids.
---
Not only that but I expect GDKP pugs going on after a couple months of release which kind of promotes what's going to happen with the loot system staying how it is thus far in raids. 
---
Again, not the end of the world but I really hope it's just taken out of the game entirely.
---
Are you blizzards therapist or something? You predicted their behavior perfectly.  
---
This really. They listened to the community and actually made the suggestion from the community, even better and make more sense about loot trading.
---
Now we just need to make us heard about RP-PvP servers.
---
2 hours seems like an unnecessarily long time if it's only for accidental loot.
---
The way we used loot trading in Wrath was to hang on to the item in hopes of getting a better upgrade later in the raid, at which point you can trade the item to your buddy or whoever was second place on the roll.
---
For example, if I got a cloak upgrade early in Naxx, I would leave it unequipped and then get the better cloak from KT and trade the lesser one to someone else.
---
If loot trading really is just to rectify mistakes, then 2 hours is far longer than necessary. 
---
The devs are addressing each and every one of our concerns guys.  Not everyone might like their decisions 100%, but they're very obviously taking our input seriously and are demonstrating a willingness compromise. This is all good news.
---
Now, please everyone stop freaking out so much :)
---
The most overused sets would be any of the ones used for heirlooms. So might, valor, shadowcraft, dreadmist, etc. 
---
Judgment was pretty overexposed when Blizzard first added transmog but I don't see it that often anymore. It's probably still one of the most individually popular transmog sets but there's so much armor in retail at this point that people aren't limited to the same handful of sets they were in Cata and MoP. I can't think of anything in particular that I feel is overexposed these days. 
---
I actually don't mind transmogging Judgment anymore because I know I won't look like every other paladin. 
---
So does the screech debuff actually produce threat even though it does no damage? Kind of like demo shout? 
---
Yeah, blizz saw all the white knights giving them a compromise and ran with it.  No loot trading would have been so much better.
---
UBRS will be the biggest culprit.  
---
I would bet money that they are not considering UBRS as a raid in this.  It will be 40 mans and ZG/AQ20
---
Yeah. All good points. I think an exact replica of the old days probably isn't realistic. So, if we get something close enough, like that one Simpsons episode where Homer hops through parallel dimensions trying to find his home timeline, then settles for one where everything's exactly the same except everyone has lizard tongues. Well that's good enough I suppose, given how worse it could be otherwise.
---
Game design, though, is definitely a lesson in one thing: in whatever decision made, there's a tradeoff. Even if it seems like a 100% positive move, that's just confirmation that you're not seeing the negative tradeoff lying underneath. 
---
But it's okay, lizard tongues is good enough I suppose. Makes you understand puritan logic tho.
---
I hope this quells some concerns the player base has regarding loot trading, as this addresses one of the concerns that came up, while providing a method to fix loot issues from raids.  
---
Raids are a situation where this is least likely to be abused, and most likely to be used legitimately.  Good call.
---
Good solution as this is exactly what I said they should do with loot trading!
---
Lakeshire and darkshire still haunt my dreams.
---
Cool to hear!
---
I never heard about it happening back in Vanilla, but that doesn’t mean much.  I mean I saw some hunter videos of someone soloing instances back in Vanilla, but I don’t know that it was ever farmed seriously.  
---
Open World and 45 minutes to spare: Druid
---
&gt;but there's no reason to be all high and mighty about maturity and how you're better than "one of those childish, try-hard (as if that's an insult) pvpers
---
Well, those are your words I never said anything about "tryhards". Being a tryhard is not even related to anything you say in world chat. If being openly racist, sexist etc. is just "childish" for you I don't think we can find a common ground to discuss this topic.
---
Would it be fun?  Probably!  Was it how Vanilla actually was?  Absolutely not.
---
I also think it might be fun to have dual specs and buffs to Ret and Boomkins in Classic, but you don't see me arguing for those things because it would no longer be the same game.
---
Cloth is cloth it's not like they are gonna have a ton of options while levelling lol
---
Pog
---
No loot trading would be best, but raid-only loot trading is definitely *better*. Good improvement, from my view. Berry good.
---
UBRS went from 40 to 15 to 10.

&gt; I don't know when complaining about a game became this terrible thing 
---
I don't even know where you're getting this idea. This subreddit is filled constantly with dozens of highly upvoted complaints. The forums are pages of pages of complaints. You have to live in a bubble to believe that "complaining" is frowned upon in ANY way by the gaming community. 
---
Sure! They’ve completely train wrecked Heroes of the Storm for starters. (Canceling HGC before Christmas leaving all pros jobless, nuking development of the game)
---
BfA is a dumpster fire.
---
Diablo fans have been consistently screwed with no content other than “themed seasons” which adds virtually no new gameplay.
---
Those are a couple quick examples off the top of my head. I think they’re doing great things for Classic, but people so easily flip-flop to forgiveness over the smallest things. I’m hyped as anyone here, but we need to not be so fickle with their recent track record.
---
Ofc we CAN complain. It's in no way perfect but I would say it's a reasonable compromise.
---
As someone who played Vanilla back in the days and on Pservers, Hunters aren't as rude anymore due to better knowledge. Indeed Warriors are the new hunters in some ways but most people ask before getting their specialized gear (tho things change a little for lvl 60 dungeons, people still ask before rolling on leather/mail most of the time).
---
Getting cloth armor for out of combat regen is not really a thing tho, it's insignificant. Same goes for Staves since they aren't Mace class so they don't get the advantage of weapon-specific specializations if you play Arms (and 2h Fury isn't that great until you have BWL+ gear which by then there is no good staves for Warriors IIRC).
---
While daggers are good for tanking, it's insignificant during leveling and getting a fast sword/mace/axe is not much different.
---
If you were on Arthas it very well could have been me.
---
This makes no sense dude? There was no sharding in Vanilla...
---
There was also no duel specs.. 
---
Whats your point?
---
Thanks guys, great compromise. Nice to see you're listening to the concerns of the community, that's a great way to make a devoted following. 
---
Yo dawg, I heard you like complaining, so I'm complaining about your complaining. 
---
This is the perfect solution, praise you guys!
---
Was going to say this. I wouldn't search expansion names of current expansions, I don't even need to search WoW, results are tailored to me so much that anything remotely capable of being linked to WoW is pushed to the top.
---
Now, if I wanted to search something specifically about Classic I would have to search vanilla or classic wow for, say, a database, or quest, or info in general. 
---
You have a lot of choices leveling, especially if one goes tailoring. Tailoring mining is profitable.
---
well here's the thing: if you're in a hosted pug with about 20 guildies (most of whom are alts), you can easily have everybody roll for an item and then an alt gives it to the main - of course, I would also consider just saying "hey give it to X" if I win the roll with my alt. so it's not something that is impossible today, but I can imagine that the "normal behavior" of people in PUGs changes a bit, as you can just roll for whatever item any of your friends need (that you'd be allowed to roll on) and have them return the faver if you're then lootrestricted (usually +1 MS)
---
Gotta min/max my level 20 greens tho 
---
WoW was my first mmo and I only had experience with Halo and crash bandicoot. So you can imagine how much I had to learn. 
---
That being said, my favorite one was learning how the mailbox worked. I remember buying things on the AH and then freaking out because I spend the good but I had no idea how to get the item lol. Good times
---
You're right, there was no improved respawns. Fine.
---
There was also no sharding, not fine.
---
We need one or the other because they said they're basically going to force changes down our throats.. 
---
Yeah, it was converted in 1.10. That is relatively late in the game. I am still wishing UBRS is 15 and BRS, Scholomance, and Stratholme are 10. 
---
So you're against sharding also?
---
I think a big thing that helps as a tank, that most people overlook or just "assume" everyone already knows, is learn the other classes. I'm not talking about a deep dive or anything. But be aware of who can mitigate there own aggro, or what's the cool down of a hunters trap. Knowing that sapping without being spec'd into imp sap, WILL break stealth. Ect. As a tank, you take on a lot of extra responsibility. You're the party leader. So lead! Tanking can be a lot more work than DPS, but it's worth it in the long run.
---
https://www.reddit.com/user/cirquar/posts/
---
Posting another daily thread on this, huh?
---
This is a perfect compromise. I am super impressed with the classic team and the communication with the community. I would prefer no loot trading, but I completely understand the decision here. Bravo Team Classic!
---
If UBRS is considered a raid, this isn't enough.
---
This doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
---
First, LFR wasn't in vanilla, so it seems pretty irrelevant here. People abused the anonymity of LFR to ninja items, but LFR won't be in Classic WoW, so that isn't relevant.
---
Second, according to this post, raids will still have loot trading. So according to you, this really didn't even fix anything, as raids were where you are more likely to encounter ninjas.
---
So I don't really get your point. Do some people abuse the system? Sure. But the ability to roll need on an item and then trade it to a friend has *always* been in the game. Whether by a built-in loot trading system, or by submitting GM tickets. It was always doable. Yet by your own comment, it wasn't really a thing you noticed happening until LFR came around. So I would agree with /u/laughingplague. People are crying about a hypothetical boogeyman.
---
omg this is just great
---
When there's a bluepost saying that sharding has been removed from the code i'll have completed my mission as a noble fan.
---
I highly doubt they would release expansion servers until well after they'd ran through the vanilla content cycle, so it would most likely be 2 years before we might see a TBC server, and a year or so after that until WotLK. Sure we might see a BfA classic server, but that would be about a decade from now haha.
---
Haha prior to the free world experience I had with wow, I guess you could say Mario world and conkers bad fur Day.   
---
Server management is a strange beast.  You don’t want to create a bunch of servers that fill up and then empty out as a few high pop servers become the place to be, leaving everyone else with wasted time and SOL on their server choice, but logistically everyone can’t exist in the same virtual space without crashing the server.  
---
Ideally you want to end up in the same virtual space as your friends and enemies with the illusion you are sharing a world, but whether anyone has cracked the magic formula for that, I don’t know.  
---
You see my 40 man loot post? you're going to love the responses there.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/8ss2u9/new_idea_for_fair_loot_in_40_mans/
---
No, a 30-60 min que was normal on my server until cross realm bgs. Some people would rather just get the by in a reasonable amount of time.
---
Well if you're in-game all day, no job, no nothing, you'll always hit the prime time hours with BGs popping. People with lives might never get to see those prime time hours if no cross realm battlegrounds, so they could never conceivably compete in the rankings even if they devoted all their off-work hours to the game.
---
But I realize my initial post triggered the fuck out of a few neckbeards, and I'm more than content.
---
Oh, there will STILL be ninja looters :)
---
Worry not about that :).
---
This is a really nice balance. Makes sense to me. I’m glad they are listening. 
---

SL locks were almost unstoppable 1v1, their damage is a bit pants but it didn't really matter.
---
Sorry if this is a stupid question, but how does this compromise differ from Vanilla? How do systems like loot rolls and DKP work without loot trading? 
---
Wow, that's great compromise. I actually can't believe, after all whining on r/wow about blizzard not listening, here we have devs who actually do something good with our feedback. You're restoring my faith in blizz
---
With staggered content releases i wonder if they'll actually leave them at the original size to start with.
---
I imagine the biggest factor will be if they can get the right values for all the mobs, which might not be possible :(
---
BUT....#nochanges ??????? Bwahahaha!
---
Me too, but can we not give them any bad idea please ? :D
---
It just seems overall silly though, because even though you are stacking the odds in your favor, you are still playing with odds. You could deal with a situation where the 1 PUG actually wins the roll. 
---
But it is going to be in it
---
Well, UBRS can be done in a raid group. But also in a party of 5. Technically, UBRS is a raid...a mini-raid, but still...raid.
---
So, UBRS will have loot trading.
---
I don't see that as a problem, since you can Master Looter it. 
---
I mean that is true. If the community demands "good" changes and Blizzard listens, it makes the game better. If the community demands "bad changes" (LFG for example) and Blizzard listens, the game becomes worse. 
---
Me and a friend, both hunters, duo'd inner mara around level 40-45 one time for fun in vanilla. It was surprisingly easy I remember, but tedious for the two of us, managing traps and pets. I imagine a geared 60 could solo inner mara but its been so long I don't really know for sure.
---
Never tried DM or heard about it.
---
We did it Reddit!
---
Why? because people take vacation for WoW Classics? it's nothing new tho.
---
Waiting for the barely 10min u/EsfandTV video saying, "we did it" to come out
---
Rogues only have the advantage of picking fights (unless they get ganked fighting a mob) they really aren't that strong aside from leveling and at low gear levels.
---
I hope it's as it was in 1.10. I will not be a hardcore player (a lot of time) I was before and getting 15 people together would be a chore for UBRS. 1.12 it is!
---
And potentially Alterac Valley.
---
This situation is again not a pug by any definition, and those 20 people conspiring to gear others would again have more success doing so via master looter.
---
Even in these ridiculous concocted situations that essentially never occur, the problem is not at all any worse that what exists by these people using master looter.
---
Is it even worth playing enhance in vanilla without wind fury mega procs? How hard does this hurt sham viability in PvP

I have a long track record of shitting on Blizzard, but as of recent, Blizzard's Classic team has been listening to community concerns and responding VERY quick for Blizzard standards with compromised changes.   Changes that have thus far, been a clear win for the elite side of the community.
---
You have to give credit, where credit is due.
---
If you want to take a Blizzard hate stance, take the stance that "they are only doing it, because they are catering to the majority and their concerns, for the highest profits $$$"
---
Whatever stance you take, we're getting a better product, than I ever expected personally.  
---
So....your theory is they know what we want, say they will do something worse then come back a month later and change it to the way it should be?  What?
---
Cheers. I'll try to find it.
---
wtf is versatility
---
Well, they are really working in building their trust back...isn't it?
---
Yes, they are are still far from...but at least, they are trying.
---
Ya, even if people don't catch the deception at first, eventually word should spread that "I never get loot when I join this guild's raid, something is up."
---
Yeah that's troo. My statement was a sweeping generalization. May the scumbags commence in dungeons if not raiding 
---
You can google druids ganking other druids and find people talking about this on forum posts dating back to the early 2000s. Did people follow this rule 100%? Surely not. But this was the prevailing mentality. Sorry, you are wrong! 
---
You get a neat little rhythm going. It's simple fun. 
---
I would gladly compromise with both Scholo and UBRS being 10 mans.
---
I see you haven't met our community, prepare for months of hysterical pearl clutching.  
---
true, but if we host an MC pug, we have about 20 guildies. now if the two maintanks don't need anything and are just there to help, they could still roll on items that would benefit other players. I do that to some degree (rolling for others), but only if I could also use it. I'd never roll on an item that my warrior could use, but that I really don't want, only to roll for a buddy of mine.
---
or in other words: yes this happens to some degree, but I'd expect it to become much more standard behavior. I'd still prefer no loot trading and no GM help at all, but I'm totally happy with what we've gotten, it's a good compromise
---
youre getting 1.12 and youre gonna like it.
---
Many, many, many AV games in this 1.12 format go like this:
---
There's an initial mad dash to the end for both factions. One of two things happen:
---
a) One of the factions successfully take down Vanndar/Drekthar
---
b) Both factions are wiped by defenders, people are discouraged by losing the initial rush and think the game is lost. At this point the game spirals into a mess with everyone going everywhere and mid-fights are aplenty.
---
TLDR; There will be end-boss rush games and stalemate games. Probably mostly end-boss rushes though, something like 70-30 ratio.
---
Too much good loot in UBRS, getting a 15 man was never hard for that particular instance.
---
I'm not aloud to talk about other games in this sub but needless to say one currently in alpha has mastered that, DU is the acronym. 
---
But, considering wow isn't based around new technologies that manage that server load, I think we should frankly just backend the server size and load management, deal with a slight amount of lag when theres large server battles and just brute force the issue. There's no reason to make another player invisible when you could do things like reduce poly count and opacity of other players at a distance. 
---
Still, I don't think this is a server issue anymore, they've improved the code, wow never had the worst lag when it came to players unless it was a huge server battle, even then it was a looong time ago. 
---
This is only an issue of resource management, and server population size illusion. and if thats the case, fuck the resources, make them respawn slightly faster and in 2 extra places or something. and server population size? Theres nothing you can do but server mergers making two small servers into a medium one, and 2 mediums into a large. 
---
Classic to me feels almost like the team is in a bubble from the rest of their company. They’re doing very good things so far and it’d be enough to get me to sub. I’d love to see a comeback but so far it’s only here. 
---
on our server, pretty much all pugs are hosted by guilds who bring 10-30 players and need randoms to fill the raid
---
Your comments about Rogue and Priest leads me to believe you like to specialize.  There's nothing wrong with that, but Druid is a very bad class if you don't play them as a hybrid.  They don't do well in a pure spec sense, PvE healing is Resto and Balance Moonglow, PvP is usually 11 points deep in every tree.  They really shine once you stop trying to play them like a shitty Rogue or a subpar Priest.  Just food for thought.
---
Hopefully that's how blizzard considers it too. I'm sure they'll clarify given the increase in communication these past few months 
---
Like I said, only one I was pretty worried about. I don't play melee, but I could still see it being pretty rough with people hiding Truestrike, Dal'Rend's MH/OH, etc. 
---
&gt;Definitely one of my favorite zones, only really beaten out by Ashenvale for me.
---
That's quite interesting to me. I levelled in ashenvale a fair bit, but always felt a bit bored to be totally honest. What was it about Ashenvale you enjoyed? (No hate here, just curious :) ).
---
In a perfect world, yes I am... but realistically, I am not.  Sharding is a necessary evil.  I am working under the following assumptions:
---
1) Server merges are far more destructive to communities and a worse solution than sharding the starting zones for a ~week or so.  
---
2) 2.5k - 3k populations are ideal for Vanilla-like recreations.  
---
3) 70% of players will drop off after a month or two.  
---
4) 12k populations are not Vanilla-like.
---
If there were a way to launch servers with only ~3k players and somehow guarantee that none of them dropped off, that would obviously be the idea solution.  But realistically, that would just result in a bunch of ~500 pop servers a few months after launch, and then merges would happen -- which is functionally equivalent to having simply played on a 2-month long shard, anyway.
---
If anyone has a better solution for managing the populations than sharding, I think a lot of us are all ears.  But merges or overcrowded zones are both bigger negative impacts to an authentic Vanilla experience than sharding the first ~10 hours of the game for a week after launch.
---
Thanks for this. I heard someone reference this the other day on a podcast but I haven't been able to remember the name of the video. 
---
I found Alex Jones's account guys.
---
Ima get a lot of hate for this but honestly without spell batching its not even the same game. I'd advocate for the latter any day of the week, but a BC launch is just more realistic for those two things.
---
What was the server pop? Was there faction imbalance? Did you play before or after free transfers were offered?
---
Of course but there is also a higher chance of player dropping out. And if your group doesn't have a warlock - you are screwed. If you have a lot of free time you can wait but I for instance won't be able to do a 3h UBRS anymore (sadly).
---
Exactly.  So the argument then becomes -- "which one of these necessary evils is closest to a faithful recreation of Vanilla?"
---
I would argue limited sharding is closer than a frustrating, overpopulated experience.
---
I want to switch from Alliance to Horde for classic but tbh I think it’s just that “grass is greener” feeling.  
---
Most likely I’ll stick to what I know. 
---
I believe the current armory even has a log of epic gear people get. So if they suddenly had T2 on, you could tell if they actually got it miraculously in a later raid, or if they had it the whole time. 
---
You got rid of loot trading which means requests have to go through customer service. You also have bare bones customer service which means loot trading requests will take days if not weeks. Great plan. Also thanks neckbeards. 
---
I thought about that too, but reading it from someone else really helps!
---
Be prepared for sadness. It will already have an internal 3 second cool down. Which means not only can you not proc it off of it self. If you go Axe and Board, you won't even be able to procc it on back to back attacks. Enhance is 1000% ultra garbage meme spec by this patch.
---
If it wasn't for Videos of Enhance pre nerfer and some vids of mega geared ele shammys. Shamans would most likely have a similar pop to druids. As in they would not exist. About 50% of the shaman pop at any given time is only their for an unattainable pipe dream lol. To sum it up unless you just wanna be a pure support healer with cool offense support spells for friends this is not the class for you.
---
I am not saying ele is bad in pvp to be clear. What I am saying though is that it's close to unplayable until you have god gear. Which almost no one will attain.
---
But in retail and on pservers raids had such high priority that it is/was a given that you get your hard earned loot. 
---
I like the approach they take introducing loot trading to raids but not 5men. I fucked up back then and never did it cross my mind asking to get loot assigned in a 5men. The first DFT after a year of raiding to be misassigned can seriously impact a guild's morale.
---
“Saving players time” hah, sure.  Are you sure you dont mean GM’s time, or Blizzards money?
---
RIP pug Raids
---
If you’re in a lootmaster raid, all of the gear can be traded. 
---
The 5-man group format of it came much later. 
---
You're right about the semantics used. General hit % is more accurate. And both spell chance to hit and melee chance to hit are influenced by the level of the enemy you are attacking, which is well known. As for your second point, I did link some threads where others confirmed what I said about a change taking place sometime between patch 1.0 - 1.12, although, like me, nobody knows for sure and the patch notes reveal nothing.
---
As for your third point, as I mentioned above, I really do mean only chance to hit based on level difference, which effects both melee and casters.
---
And finally, regarding your last point, a literal child CAN physically hit a grown adult (the equivalent of a level 30 against a  level 60) and this makes sense since it... literally makes sense. Now, as for damage done, that child will not seriously hurt the adult for the most part and I'm fine with damage reduction in WoW to an extent (keeping in mind that a level 30 naturally does far less damage then a 60). And I'm OK with this mostly applying to just PvP, that is, mobs that are 30 levels lower then you should miss you or do very little damage to you and you should resist their spells. But for PvP to be fun and exciting for players of all levels, then it is my opinion that low level players should at least have a chance against high level players.
---
you a sexy mofo
---
ninja looting isnt bound to this, it happened back then and will happen again. Loot trading conceals it thats the problem, you get to skip the reputation damage.
---
I would have been fine with it in dungeons too. But I'm fine with this solution as well. So this is likely a good solution that will at least partly please the people who were very critical of it. 
---
Of course he is a pussy if he only wants to fight "lowbies" and not players who can fight back
---
There were a lot of stupid design decisions in Vanilla. Those are what made the game great. Pick and choosing which ones to "fix" is a recipe for disaster. 
---
I think for channeled and AoE spells, only the initial cast is what procs Concentration. You can level as Arcane, but I don't see a convincing reason to do so. Frostbite + Shatter is super strong.
---
It's not automatic though. Loot trading in dungeons is up to the players to settle and is too easy to abuse. I'd much rather not have to worry about being scammed out of loot when puging a dungeon than the occasional honest missclick.    
---
If someone did ninja, and say it was a missclick, I would at least know they were a ninja and avoid them in the future. Also the incentive to do so would me much lower if they can't afterwards trade it to a friend.  
---
Yup, that'd be my choice, I think they contributed a fair bit to the loss of community. 
---
I could maaaybe see them have a use if they change their mind on AV and decide to do an earlier version of it. If that were the case, we probably \*would\* need something to help mitigate queue times, and CRBG could serve that purpose. But I wouldn't want CRBG and 1.12 AV together. 
---
smiley face https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/loot-trading-in-classic/131586

Yeah I know a lot of people like that too but most people just call those easy targets in PvP :b
---
Oh yeah, I love Felwood too :) great call. 
---
I can't speak about Mara as I've never attempted at soloing it but I can say without a doubt i'll be solo farming DM north on my hunter at LEAST 2-3 hours a day when it releases. It's sort of like farming mobs.. once you know the route you just turn your brain off and just grind it out. Not to mention it's probably one of the best gold making methods in the game
---
&gt;How sad when all of these things became threatless nothings in later expacs.
---
True that. I was just thinking that to myself this morning... Thank goodness for Classic :) 
---
We are technically getting the watered down version, but we are also getting the version that allows you to get av tokens. :)
---
If you were filling a pug in an UBRS on nostalrius there was a really high chance any of those items would already be reserved by whoever was making the group already. 
---
this is the more specific and correct line to delve further information from. Because they dont make any distinction between raids and dungens here, except for stating that dungeons are 5 man content
---
It's not a 2 month long shard because you're taking everyone who was once on your server with you, even the logged out ones. 
---
It's more like you were on a desert island with no food, and someone moved that island next to a garden island with too much food. 
---
Who is all this food, i've never tasted these guys before... 
---
We'll, thank god they're here because I was about to die on this server. 
---
The authentic vanilla experience is a varying experience, meaning sometimes an area is full of people who wont let you farm, and sometimes it's completely empty.... This is the vanilla experience, not "theres enough for everyone" its "theres not enough for everyone, so compete" driving up prices, driving up business and unique ideas, driving up the community aspects of the game WHICH IS WHY WE ARE ALL HERE. 
---
Dual Wield doesn't exist in vanilla.
---
Well yes but 1/5 &lt; 2/5
---
They literally have come up with the best possible compromise. Well done classic team.
---
It makes absolutely no difference to me whether it's in the game or not.
---
What makes is a difference to me is that idiots are influencing devs with ideas that are not logically sound.
---
Prime time would be both player's best bet to get games with no cross-realm implemented. Let's say a tryhard gets a queue or two before noon, some after, but the brunt of honor is earned at prime time when the other guys get off work
---
With cross-realm, the tryhard gets queues 24 hours a day and the other guy still only gets honor from prime hours. 
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/loot-trading-in-classic/131586/111
---
Confirmed a raid means having a lockout. UBRS won't have loot trading
---
&gt;Was it how Vanilla actually was?
---
Was there Sharding in Vanilla? I mean Blizzard have 3 choices. Either they use a queue, sharding or dynamis respawns.
---
Vanilla was full with a long queue. It was even in mainsteram news about how the game was funn. That is an authentic launch, not Sharding.
---
You're right! Cross realm BGs here we come!! 
---
\*released in patch 1.12
---
The fact that we are not getting cross-realm BGs is proof that Blizzard IS choosing what aspects of Vanilla they are leaving in.
---
Hooray! 
---
Man, the Classic team is absolutely knocking it out of the park. No loot trading in non-raid content is a great choice. If Blizz continues to listen to fan feedback this way, I'm confident this will be an epic gaming experience that will truly live up to the name of Classic WoW
---
Too bad a lot of the tier gear is so bad, it does look awesome. 
---
Speaking of. For which classes is the tier gear best suited? I'm pretty sure it's not BiS for any class, but I would imagine some of them wants a lot of pieces in at least some stages of the game. 
---
Why is everyone hyped over this? The game is objectively better withou loot trading.
---
Whew I was mid REEEE until I saw this
---
And because we complained about it, they announced Classic. What's your point?
---
People definitely complained about the starting zones in privates.
---
Yes it's an MMO. The world needs people and competition. That does not mean it needs 1,000 people all trying to do the exact same quest at the exact same time in the smallest zones in the entire map. That's not a realistic experience and that's not a Vanilla experience.
---
Sharding at launch is a perfectly reasonable solution. I understand the concerns about when sharding will end, or if it will ever end, but I think Blizzard has proved over the last few weeks that they have a pretty good grasp on what the community is talking about. They know sharding has no place in Classic on a permanent basis. I mean, one of the first things out of Ion's mouth when he was talking about sharding was:
---
&gt;We understand, and I understand completely, that sharding is antithetical to the concept of a cohesive Classic community.
---
Yeah, that's true.  I would be okay with a queue system.  It would certainly prod those 70% of people who are eventually going to quit to quit even faster.
---
The answer to the UBRS question is: loot trading will be available in content that has a raid lock. UBRS will not have a raid lock.
---
Quote:
---
A big part of loot trading (in a 2-hour window) as a solution to a concern is that raid locks require you to wait a week (or 3 days) before you can try again for the loot that was accidentally given to the wrong person.
---
ill take that bet, as you generally have to have your party converted to a raid to compensate for any more than 5 members
---
Great, it sounds like you have a memory that supports your argument. That doesn't mean the rest of us do.
---
That is great news! One less thing to worry about.
---
Wonderful. Perfect compromise and intelligent solution.
---
It wasn’t as much complaining about current wow as much as wishing to have vanilla WoW back. We have classic coming. Let’s be happy about it.
---
Keep an eye on your healer's mana bar, and let them drink up before pulling, if necessary. Mana management is much more of a concern in vanilla dungeons than retail. 
---
Lesser magic wand &gt; Greater magic wand &gt; Excavation Wand &gt; Gravestone Scepter &gt; ?
---
There's my wand progression plan.
---
Was it ever mentioned if GMs will answer loot tickets for dungeons, or is it tough luck?
---
I assume the ladder but wasn't sure.
---
Classic team is absolutely knocking it out of the park. This is awesome!
---
If my healer is my wife I'll have no choice or I'll end up sleeping on the couch! 😂
---
Imagine getting chain-CCed by a bunch of 30's as a level 60. Guess OP forgot the 45 sec polly in vanilla, allowing lowbies to get it off on players way higher level than them would have such negative effect on the powertrip you get as a level 60 in a lowbie zone.
---
I would argue that sharding is exactly why the game began to suffer so much. Theres a lot of problems after vanilla, but sharding is a high priority to the reason all further expansions failed. 
---
The game isn't an MMO with sharding, plain and simple it kills the entire idea of a "world" of warcraft. Empty world more like it. Nah thats' not mmo thats just mo.
---
That's an omega yikes from me dog
---
I may be misremembering, but don't Void Walkers have an aoe taunt in Vanilla? That would be a better tank than any hunter pet if you're already planning on having a warlock. There is footage of a couple void walkers tanking the first trash mobs in MC.
---
With your party, between Mage Rogue and Hunter you have 3 decent length cc if you pull correctly. You shouldn't even need aoe threat that often.
---
Sure, but compared to everything that came after wotlk tbc is still really good lmao
---
a Blue just responded saying it only applies to raid with a lock out timer. UBRS does not have a lock out timer and will not be subject to the 2 hour loot rules.
---
Nothing like that was mentioned but yes, probably "tough luck" which is fine to me.
---
i want no changes but im happy enough with this.
---
10 man end game dungeons was cancer in vanilla. It was virtually impossible to get quest groups together and it was just a bore to dominate the dungeon. It's entirely doable with 5 but with 10 it takes longer to get a group, you get less loot, and it's a zergfest. No thanks.
---
So when Blizzard responds to player complaints, it's bad. And when Blizzard responds to player wishes, it's good.
---
Shut up and be a mindless consumer
---
\- OP
---
That sucks.
---
Dope, thanks!
---
There's another blue reply in the forum thread clarifying:   Loot trading *WILL* be in for anything with a raid lockout.  Loot trading *WILL NOT* be in for anything that does not have a raid lockout.   That's the line they're using to differentiate.
---
Can anyone clarify how this works with world bosses?  I only killed a few WB in Vanilla and can't remember if there's a lockout or not.
---
Yes, all those loot trading posts were so constructive....
---
Does anyone know if "raids" means 10 man raids in UBRS? Or perhaps only 40 man raids?
---
Because IMO ubrs would be the place to most commonly see Ctual abuse that mattered, i.en dal rends set, truestrike shoulders, and briarwood, since all can be viable for nearly all group members and easy to abuse.
---
If this only means 40 mans and actual raids then that is perfect. His phrasing on "drops in raids" sounds good to me since he references the large number too.. but technically by the latter a 10man is also a "raid" so I am curious
---
Since I didn't see anyone answer it here yet, Kaivax gave a reply regarding UBRS around 100 posts down:
---
"The answer to the UBRS question is: loot trading will be available in content that has a raid lock. UBRS will not have a raid lock.
---
A big part of loot trading (in a 2-hour window) as a solution to a concern is that raid locks require you to wait a week (or 3 days) before you can try again for the loot that was accidentally given to the wrong person."
---
TY Kaivax!
---
Yeah, you get flagged when you enter an enemy city, even on PvE servers. The difference between PvE and PvP servers is that on PvE servers, those are the only places you get flagged in. 
---
Really, the only reason I even bring up that the game was changed is because otherwise, what I'm asking for would violate the "no changes" mentality that we all want. If the internal mechanics of hit chance based on level difference WAS changed sometime during vanilla, there is a possibility that the original mechanic would be restored allowing lower level players to engage in meaningful world pvp again. I'm not expecting it but there is a chance and I hope the community agrees. 
---
I am not saying UBRS isn't technically a raid, since of the size of the group is beyond 5.  I am sure we will see this question asked to them, with them clarifying "raids" as instanced PvE encounters, that aren't dungeons.  Like MC, BWL, ZG, AQ20/40 and Naxx.
---
people complaining for changes is what gave us the easy game that is retail wow.
---
At what level does this become a thing? So far enhancement shamans, mages and hunters do so much damage the shield goes down instantly. I’m only level 23.
---
Well i'm glad you shared that. But i'm not looking to start the game with 1/4th of my night elf population, i'm looking to start the release with a chaotic bang. And if it's just a vanilla oh... everyones sharing, everyones happy, theres plenty to go around. Then it's a stale, boring, heartless and empty release. Who even cares about being around for release if it's not everyone on your race and server partying together in the same place for the only time.
---
These are moments that aren't recreate-able it's a shame to waste it completely by simply sharding.
---
I don't know why we're talking about system that started sometime in wotlk on classic forum. I gave you my worst experience with loot trading, that's all.
---
And you would lose that bet.  They clarified about 10-15mins ago that the line they are drawing is whether or not the content has a raid lockout.  If it has a raid lockout loot trading is in, if it does not have a raid lockout loot trading is out.
---

This doesn't stop ninja looting.

Once a server became imbalanced, it would encourage players of the minority to avoid it like the plague.

Thanks for the post.  I appreciate the hard work.

It'll be interesting how realms end up populated given the number of retail tourists, the low subscription fee pay wall for newcomers, and both complete guilds and streamers declaring their realm beforehand.

Looking at the blue post responses this seems to be an unpopular opinion but we could have had no loot trading but all those people let blizzard off the hook too easy.

I'm happy to see a guild that has raids ending at 10 PM EST! Now, to find a Horde guild like this..
---
It doesn't matter what pathing the elementals have. Hunters have feign death. Mara Solo will be there. I'm only cool with DM:N farm if Cho'rush/King Gordok are at least linked. 
---
So again, what's the better solution?  Launching with 10k players is categorically *not* what Vanilla was, so it doesn't matter how fun any of us think that might be -- that's a private server experience, not Classic WoW.  What is a better solution?  I am genuinely asking.
---
Ah yes, i also like to assume the ladder. 
---
Solves most worries. I do think a 5-10 minute reroll period (that only the winner can start) would solve the issue in 5 mans, where anyone who was eligible for the roll before can reroll again, so still not guaranteed to pass it on to a "ninja" guild mate, but honest mistakes can be sorted by the in game mechanisms.
---
But this quells issues that some we're really caught up on, which is nice.
---
This is a positive change. Although it could still negatively effect UBRS Strat and Scholo if you join any of these runs they should be Masterlooted. Any smart pug group will ML major loot bosses anyways.
---
Thanks for that
---
Wow, they're actually listening and responding to feedback. Didn't expect for this change to be fixed at all. 
---
Outstanding move.
---
people complaining for changes is what gave us the easy game that is retail wow. not the same as complaining for no changes. 
---
Don't think they've actually released a statement on whether BGs are cross-realm or not. 
---
Wait for Tipsout's 20 min video about why it is so great
---
Its been answered. Only applies to raid locks, so no UBRS.
---
I don't know why we're talking about system that started sometime in wotlk on classic forum. I presented LFR Cata loot trading because that's text book example of loot trading abuse.  
---
In classic raiding the issue will still exist during pug raiding but it's minimal because:
---
1) guild hosting the pug will set master loot in order to get the best items that were advertised as reserved before hand
---
2) pug raiding was always a gamble. Anyone could ninja anything and it was expected since you were competing for great items, sometimes bis.
---
People keep touting WoD around because it was also a bad expansion, but for opposite reasons. In WoD the overall gameplay and quality of the content (sans Garrisons) we’re still what we’ve come to expect from Blizzard, the just wasn’t very much of it. BfA on the other hand does, on paper, have a large quantity of content; but it’s absolute trash and the gameplay isn’t particularly engaging. 
---
Sorry classic noob here. Why do you need a warlock there?
---
Nailed it. Nothing but net. Grand slam. &lt;insert additional sports reference to point acquisition here&gt;
---
Thank you so much! This really is the perfect solution. Making it easier on raids, while keeping dungeons intact. 
---
Enhancement doesn't hinge on Windfury, it's based on the combined power of the gear available for that spec and the tools of the class.
---
Enhancement wasn't considered a high performance PvP spec until later expansions. A lot of people thought Enhancement Shamans were OP back in 2005, not so many people still think that way on private servers any more.

Enhancement does fine in duels/world PvP when there's not too many players around, but it gets destroyed in organized PvP. People just CC, mana burn and kite you. The class just doesn't have a great balance of defensive cooldowns, solid gap closers or CC that enables the melee playstyle against experienced players.
---
People gravitate towards Ele/Resto because they can't be kited as easily and they have a lot of dependable burst.
---
If it's purely whether it's a raid group, what's stopping you from "raiding" a 5 man with 5 people to enable loot trading? Quests can't be done, but that's about it.
---
I guess Blizzard might say "that's on the player to leave if they don't like it" which is fair, but would probably still result in a lot of unwanted tickets.
---
dudu?  is this a thing now?
---
You're right. Cross realm servers are off the table but they haven't mentioned cross realm BGs. Would be interesting to see what they day about that in the future.
---
My bad. 
---
Blizzard is killing it with these blue posts! 🥳
---
Right, but I'm responding to someone discussing this happening in a raid. If a bunch of people are together in a raid, and they have a few pugs, then why wouldn't they just turn on master looter? 
---
So you don't know what you're talking about and you don't know why? Are you really gonna claim to be anything other than a circlejerker at this point?
---
UPDATE by Kaivax : 
---
**The answer to the UBRS question is: loot trading will be available in content that has a raid lock. UBRS will not have a raid lock.**
---
**A big part of loot trading (in a 2-hour window) as a solution to a concern is that raid locks require you to wait a week (or 3 days) before you can try again for the loot that was accidentally given to the wrong person.**
---
To summon a replacement. For horde going to UBRS is a LONG journey (15min fly from Undercity to Kargath alone). 
---
I got 3 monitors onefor classiccast, one for esfand and one for tipsout. The true influencers of vanilla wow and the only voice for our community thank you guys so much
---
Bubble hearth would like a word with you.
---
Did you mean CU?  If not, PM me the name of the game you're talking about if you don't mind.
---
Why would you merge it with a PvP server instead of an RP server? Wouldn't that potentially invalidate other players' choices?
---
If i were a human rogue duelling another rogue i would wait for at least 30 seconds on purpose before using it :)
---
CLARIFICATION FROM BLIZZARD ABOUT THE UBRS QUESTION. Loot Trading will only be in effect for content with a raid lockout.

Naxxramas  
---
The atmosphere. I really connected to the colors and sounds of the zone and its big enough that I could just spend hours just exploring around looking in nooks and crannies even with nothing in them.
---
Slow weapons have higher weapon damage. Any abilities that multiply off weapon damage hit harder 
---
Fantastic. Happy with this as a compromise. 
---
They are great aoe tanks in 5 mans. And if your guild wants to put in the work, top notch off tank for Naxx trash. But for a casual, pally tanks are very much viable in 5 mans.
---
Because they had already confirmed loot trading was coming in. Of all the scenarios that include loot trading, what they just announced is the absolute best case scenario.
---
Awesome, thank you! 
---
Core of this system in interesting :)
---
Additional class priority would be cool.
---
Totally forgot about the 0.5 sets...How did you get those again? Didn't you need the T0 piece first and then complete a quest or something to upgrade it?
---
Situational I suppose. I've dueled human Rogues before and you can just chase them in stealth/sprint and use vanish to get the opener through perception. Trading a vanish for opener, if you can guarantee you can stunlock them or kill them it's worth.
---
Yes, Hunters will be able to solo DM and Maraudon.  
---
All classes, including [Warriors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG8rE7ifOU) and [Rogues](https://youtu.be/Oqns6ILw-6g) can kill Princess Theradras.
---
I recommend muting the first video.
---
IMO this is the best solution. 
---
It cuts down on 99% of the abuse, which was going to happen in need/greed parties, but maintains 99% of its effectiveness since the vast majority of legit trading was going to be in master looter raids.
---
Removing it entirely cuts out that last 1% of abuse but at the expense of completely removing any way to resolve loot mistakes (assuming the alternative of hiring GMs to deal with it is completely off the table).
---
Nice!
---
I’m taking the time to tell you that I stopped reading your post at “I challenge you to prove me wrong.”.
---
What you're thinking about, with DKP or guilds rolling, is the Master Looter system.
---
Loot Trading is where when you pick up a BoP item, you have 2 hours to trade it to anyone else who was part of the same kill that dropped that item.
---
As a filthy Casual myself, I enjoy paladin  it's low stress, I can always find a group. As heals, tank, or dps in 5 mans. And with self heals, you can solo a lot of content.
---
One thing I've noticed which confuses me is that I always seem to be able gouge or blind level 60s while levelling on private servers. Do rogue cc abilities have different chances to hit higher levels or is this just a private server thing?
---
WoW was from 2006-2010 one of the things that had the most impact of my life. 
---
I quit mid Cataclysm because the I realised the game went from having a Guild that felt like a family to mass inviting for Guild Perks, queueing for instant dungeons instead of spending 3 hours, forming, travelling and finishing a dungeon with breaks and adding each other for future adventures.

Better then Shammy T3. 
---
Blizzard just showed up like. "So I heard yall like MP5? Here's all of it!" 
---
Shamans "like wait how much MP5 on their?" 
---
Blizzard: "ALL... OF.... IT.... BEYAAAAAAAAH!"
---
If it was entirely doable with 5, do it with 5.
---
Any dungeon was difficult to run in vanilla because of the time it took to gather a group, travel to the instance, and successfully complete it. 
---
Zergfest is what dungeons became in WotLK and ever since when composition didn't matter and CC wasn't used.
---
Thank you for your scathing rebuke and truly unique experience, you must be the only person ever to engage in PuG raids on retail and live. 
---
It doesn't need altered. Just like everything else. I've seen maybe 1-2 instances of gear going to wrong person in thousands of vanilla raids. The times it did happen were hilarious and we moved on. Fixing every little thing is how Vanilla becomes Theseus' Ship.
---
There won't be.
---
Kaivax update :
---
 ***The answer to the UBRS question is: loot trading will be available in content that has a raid lock. UBRS will not have a raid lock.***
---
***A big part of loot trading (in a 2-hour window) as a solution to a concern is that raid locks require you to wait a week (or 3 days) before you can try again for the loot that was accidentally given to the wrong person.***
---
We got there, fam. Rise up!
---
Dungeons was by far the bigger problem and the raid problem wasn't even a problem. People ask "can I buy that?" then you let the guild know and that behaviour will change real fast, problem solved. The dungeon problem wouldn't be solved by calling others out in the same manner.
---
My endgame goal is pvp and my chances to raid are next to none.
---
Are locks a viable option in mediocre gear? Will I be able to put up a serious fight against some epic geared classes or will I just outright suck like a Warrior in blues?
---
Time and time again, these Classic developers prove to the Classic community that they have their ears to the ground and care about the issues we vocalize. They nailed it with this compromise, and I have more and more confidence in the devs with each blue post that gets posted.
---
All these updates! I smell a beta test.
---
He's talking about whether or not it has a raid lockout. UBRS does not have a raid lockout.
---
Thanks for this. Even though I’m a Druid through and through I enjoyed my twink warlock and am considering leveling it as my Alt. 
---
Sometimes I find gear upgrades that have been sitting in my bags for weeks. That's how little gear registers for me right now. A big draw to classic. Along with 40mans, slower/simplier content, single raid difficulty level...etc.
---
Both variations favor the hardcore crowd. The key difference, though, is that both crowds get to play more often. Which is the whole point of cross realm battlegrounds and a positive thing.
---
Responsiveness to the community is what got us expansions like Warlords of Draenor and BfA
---
That is some a+ content. Cool site!
---
As a hunter, I hunt. No exceptions. Druids are pretty much beasts, so they are on top of the menu.
---
&gt;Well one thing that happened to me once was that I had a night elf character and somebody got really mad that my name sounded too similar too them. That was the weirdest thing I have experienced with rpers.
---
They sure are a colourful bunch. Im still mad my character was not RP enough but pixie the night elf futa with a 17 inch cock and wolf hands is cannon to them.
---
Thank you, Blizzard!
---
Ah, so the loot trading only applies once the item hits your bag?
---
I'm confused then. By that point, everyone either rolled or the Loot Master already gave away the item. Why did people want loot trading at all? 
---
I'm 99% sure they have all the values for each mob, pretty sure they said they had all that data during the blizzcon panel
---
Both these posts consist of people claiming things changed cause that's what they "remembered". Its the same thing ur doing, and is not evidence of any proof
---
Partly play style (having to stealth for optimal opener and loads of resetting). Partly because too many hard counters (locks, hunter, warrior, frost mage).
---
They did but it was on about a 5 min cd. I think you're right, CC and single target is the way to go. 
---
Yeah that's the sensible option (his edit wasn't present when I asked)
---
The less people you have the more time it will take.  10 man UBRS is really hard for casual players. 
---
If your idea of fun is super high burst damage with no survivability, go arms. If your idea of fun is super high sustained damage with no survivability, go fury. If you was survivability and moderate damage, go ret pally. Warriors need a friend to throw a heal out their way to be truly viable in a pvp fight, but if they get that they're good to go.
---
In pvp your weapon skill is auto maxed out for your level for hit chance. So if you are 60 and switch to fist with 1/300 wep skill you will still hit the same rate as if you had 300/300 you just will crit less
---
Abortions for some.
---
Miniature American flags for everyone else.
---
***Massive Applause**
---
I started playing a rogue when AQ launched and it took 3 expansions until I realised I could use Distract out of stealth. 
---
Pretty much solves any concern I had, Cool.
---
You will do that once...your next PuG will have no people, simply because everyone will know that you are not trustworthy.
---
I like it!

What is a ubrs? Played wow several times only getting to lvl 30 each time I’m noob
---
Great news!
---
Nice. Thanks for the link.
---
Level difference doesn't affect melee that much. It matters a lot for spells but the ratio for melee is astronomically tiny comparably 
---
Well, the chance to hit as implemented in retail and I imagine copied by private servers is outlined above so it really depends on the difference in level between you and the other player. If it's 9 or less, then your chances are over 50% (without gear/talents). Checking into both of those abilities, I didn't see anything particularly special about them to give them a higher chance to have an effect. 
---
Another awesome decision. Classic development seems to be the original crew/ideas. What the fXck happened to the retail team? Did they hold you hostage for the past 10 years?
---
UBRS stands for Upper Blackrock Spire. It is a level 60 dungeon that requires 10 people to complete. 
---
u mad bro?
---
Yes, that's an actual Classic thing. Battle Shout grants 55 threat per target, so if you buff 5 players it grants 55*5=275 threat to all nearby targets. Demoralizing Shout grants 43 threat per mob.
---
Those are base values by the way.
---
Hi, /u/cRABFATHER
---
Great movie. Just watched it again for the first time since I was like 5.
---
Cinnemasacre did a review with his buddies on Starship Troopers. I highly recommend this film to all you dudes.
---
Another potential problem would be forming a raid group to zerg Scholo or Strat with 10 people. Will Scholo &amp; Strat be possible with 10-15 people, and if so will it be considered 5-person content?
---
&gt; It's more a case of enough people showing that we want it and the rest don't have to say anything.
---
Yeah, this seems like a clear case of the Classic devs needing the Classic community to prove that's worth the costs. I'd actually be willing to bet that Classic team wants to put in an RP-PVP realm (because why not), but the higher ups have historical data that makes it seem like a financially unsound idea. Essentially they need the community to prove it'll be used enough so that they can make the case that it's worth it.
---
Fortnite is for 12 year olds.
---
Classic WoW is for teenagers &amp; adults.
---
You can strafe whilst facing your character via right click to achieve the same thing. The only time S is useful is for Tanking, and even then if its a long distance kite or positioning mobs closer to yourself, strafing wins again. 
---
There’s been issues with wow since release then. And since there’s still moaning I’d say whatever the issue is is still there. Going by every gaming sub and forum ever, every game has had issues because there’s always constant moaning. That doesn’t mean there’s an issue. People love to moan about things. 
---
But that doesn't remotely close the gap between hardcore and casual in the honor rankings - the only point of yours I'm questioning. 
---
I'm confused with the point you're trying to get across - are you advocating for the 2 hour trade window to NOT change because of the resulting community effect if it is abused?
---
Yeah on private servers it is, quite annoying actually
---
&gt; Your raid leader misallocates your boots to the *other* rogue.
---
&gt; You have to wait 4 days for the ticket to go through for a GM to swap them to your character.
---
*or*
---
&gt; The other rogue gives you the boots.
---
Only need Deadmines up to 1st boss. SFK for a few trash pulls, and don't even need to enter BFD.
---
I'm a Zug fan now.
---
You're right. But 3 witnesses is far more compelling than just one. I'd love for someone to post proof of this either by showing the internal server changes that blizzard made or a simple video of a low level player CCing a much higher one regularly. These are both unlikely so having more players in this thread post what they remember about early vanilla PvP would be good. 
---
If I have to have cancer id like prefer the treatable kind. 
---
Hey man, huge thanks for both listening to the community and interacting with us here.
---
Can't give you enough kudos for that. ^now ^^please ^^^de-neuter ^^^^alterac
---
There are several better ways to stop those ML mistakes.  Here are 2 ways:  add a confirmation button or make the loot tradeable back to the ML to redistrubute.
---
No. I was simply adding to the users comment above that complaining about everything is not good. Complaining to Blizzard is good to a degree. Getting pissed off about every little thing is not good. Which means stuff like “this shade of blue is not how i want it”. 
---
I did not mean complaining is bad. I added that complaining about everything is bad. Since not one thing in this world is the way that everybody would like it to be.
---
ew. yuck.
---
i'm hoping a large section of "private server" culture gets left behind when they realize they can't be blatantly racist in public chats without consequence.
---
Looks a lot more similar than "too bad, just don't ever make mistakes" to me. Thanks for confirming.
---
These groups are all over the place. I love it.
---
If you press enter twice between paragraphs, it'll separate them for you for your numbered list.
---
One chance per spell cast (hitting the button) always.
---
Arcane is mathematically inferior to fire/frost but not unviable.  You get some one-off utility, but less power than fire and less control than frost.  The biggest selling point of arcane is that it boosts all damage, so facing arcane immune/resistant mobs (rare to begin with) is less scary than say a frost mage fighting water elementals or a fire mage fighting fire elementals.
---
I of course agree. This is just my preference as I would not consider myself as a casual alas I won't have that much time anymore so with a group of 10 knowledgeable players it's easier as you need to find 10 not 15. That of course also takes into account that I have a guild with at least 10 knowledgeable players :)
---
Yes, it's only for things already in your bags, and equipping the item made it untradeable.
---
People wanted it for a few reasons. One, it's in retail and is more convenient than putting in a GM ticket to get an item swapped. Two, and related to one, when a Master Looter misclicks and gives it to the wrong player (which realistically never happens, but mistakes happen every 1 in a million raids), it's a simple solution.
---
The actual reason however, is one a lot worse. People wanted to abuse it to get loot. Buy loot off the person who won the roll. Group up with friends and deny loot to the random 5th person by having everyone roll to win the item, then trading the item after the dungeon is done so the 5th doesn't even know unless he inspects the winner and sees they aren't using the item. Even if the 5th person does suspect it, it'll be one person's word without proof vs 4 people's words without proof. This kind of thing was super prevalent in WoTLK when it was first introduced, and only in more recent expansions did that get changed to stop it (if you roll need, you cannot loot trade the item at all).
---
Did you read the thing? You cant trade dungeon loot only raid loot. You should not be ninjaing items for friends in dungeons in the first place. 
---
The problem with retail is not that Blizzard doesn't listen...they are listening. The problem is that the retail community is asking for the WRONG THING.
---
The retail community is the one who asked for LFG, LFR, epics for everyone, class "balance" (aka as : give everyone everything), easy access to all content, flying mounts, solo playing over raiding, faster leveling, new races, etc. etc.
---
What did you guys expected ?
---
What you asked for is what you got.
---
To rephrase the other guy's comment in a better way, giving feedback is helpful. Trolling and being a dick isn't.
---
Unfortunately a lot of complaining (feedback) falls in the latter category.
---
both of those posts have people saying it was never the case, or that it existed during 1.12/bc/wrath. none of them say the change happened during vanilla.
---
also, i remember being able to kill higher levels as a bunch of 20s and 30s back in wrath and cata. i'm pretty sure you still can, assuming the difference is only like 10-20 levels. the miss/resist chance wasn't dramatic enough to fully prevent you from doing stuff, it was just prohibitive. 
---
i think it's more likely that you were misremembering than having an undocumented change this big happening.
---
Its a spec you can use for both pve and pvp. It is even the preffered PvP premade spec.
---
Me too. I think that we're better served by CS/devs with them spending time fixing real issues rather than reallocating gear through hundreds to thousands of tickets submitted each week.
---
oh shit that one i was not aware of haha.  thanks
---
Sounds great. 
---
Anything that came after WoTLK I consider to be "WoW2" and a different game at that point.
---
Which is exactly what the guy above said - complaining about everything is not ok. People complaining for changes wasn’t good.
---
So not all complaining is good. That’s what I wanted to add to it. It’s okay to complain. But somebody is gonna complain about something which is already perfect to us.
---
I totally respect that thought, i even had it while typing my comment out (and in the car this morning when i was thinking about this very same topic while listening to countdown to classic), but that doesn't shift the dynamic here. 
---
We have a game that has hundreds of little concepts that the community can be divided on and people also want different things for classic (still mostly/very non-retail things, just not 100% unanimous person to person) so Blizzard can't just listen to us (in that its not possible, not that they should/shouldn't) so we have to give them some respect/faith to guide the game, EVEN IF ITS BASED ON OUR GENERAL WANTS/NEEDS.
---
In other words, i want to communicate to Blizz that i want classic to forever retain its gameplay themes/flavor (socially engaging gameplay, challenging content, depth of world, to name a few) but i also don't believe the game has to 100% be tethered to this ultra specific thing to achieve those themes. i also think there's a difference between saying "this is why i used to play WoW, please keep WoW this way" and "well, you guys don't know what you're doing. This is the way the game is supposed to be, we can't let it be up to you on how you make your own game".
---
God damnit i love y’all 
---
Funnily enough, speaking of aggro. Tfury is one of the main threat inducing conduits for a tank rogue. 
---
One proc per cast.  
---
See my previous answer [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b1zsem/questions_on_some_mage_mechanics/eipkgb5/?context=3).
---
How was it done in vanilla? Could you not see the server balance?   
---
Also, wouldn't you have less BG cues if you are in the minority faction? Or why would you avoid a server where your faction is 40 to 60? 
---
Well no earth shield in vanilla afaik
---
It makes me feel like a big man. 
---
Sorry man, i took your "oh well" as a regret that ninja looters won't be in Classic.
---
I’m 90% sure blizzard did make these since they were posted on the official wow website. And I never remember them making a t2.5. I used to look at these every single day before I got world of Warcraft and daydream. Man the memories these bring
---
Very good guide, thanks for sharing! I've learned many things, specially the tips about life tap. I'll definitely use it when classic will be live.
---
ahah they did. thanks, but im actually going to pay up, expect in the next couple days :)
---
How many of these updates do we need, before people will shut the fuck up about Blizzard not understanding and/or listening to the community for Classic?
---
A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one. 
---
It's the best of a bad situation for a lot of people. 
---
Blizzard stated that they wanted to use loot trading as a solution to the reallocation of gear through GM tickets. 
---
A portion of the community was against this because of the "loot hoarding" issue encountered in 5 mans, when 3-4 players roll for items to increase a player's chance of getting loot and essentially fucking over a PUG. 
---
This post eliminates the 5 man issue while solving the problem encountered with misallocation of loot in raids (decreasing GM tickets).
---
It's a compromise. 
---
***
---
&gt;The game is objectively better withou loot trading.
---
Opinion.
---
This is great. Trust is build, and Classic team knows how to fulfil expectations. I'm in joy because of the recent news and little a bit of sorrow that retail team is in such opposition... I'd like both version to thrive equally.
---
It's like they work for another company, not Activision-Blizzard.
---
For the original versions, aka pre 1.12?  I thought they were going with 1.12 because thats the earliest version they had all that info for.
---
Loot trading will be active for 2 hours after an item goes into your bag. If RL gives you the sword but actually we talked and all agreed gavin should have the sword cool trade it over, Gavin dosnt have the gold to respec but d3str0y3r does and wants it so gav can give it to him. You can only trade raid loot. 
---
Normaly the loot is usable for 2 hours before it soulbinds, If you enchant the item it will soul bind and you lose the 2 hour option. 
---
I have no idea why people wanted to trade loot, Its not like it will never drop again and raiding is not about solely loot but hey ho. Sometimes the master looter can give it to a person before they decide they dont want it or give it to the wrong person with a similar name silly stuff that like that no respecing raid leader would ever let happen. 
---
Anyone complaining about this and texture updates is a fucking nerd
---
LEMME BREAK THIS FORUM POST DOWN FOR YOU GUYS
---
The tier gear only gets bad after zg but for some classes like warrior yea it is pointless to rock a full set in dps. Most sets are designed for their specialty role
---
hey check this spec out [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LVhxdhio0uVZEV](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LVhxdhio0uVZEV) this is a spec used by a lot of people who level to 60 but still want to tank without respeccing at 60. You can easily tank all dungeons with this and even offtank molten core. It's a good hybrid spec that allows you to do abit of everything, very good for early content. You start off with arms all the way to mortal strike, then get the crit in fury and finish off in protection.
---
Nah he said in a later post just stuff with a raid lock out and UBRS wont have a raid lock out. UBERS is the classic loot system. 
---
Honestly I feel like most people have been pretty happy with pretty much every update
---
Nah I was a "special" child. I was never afraid of undead or daemons. No I always felt they were a silly fantasy. What got me as a child was things like The "predator" or "chameleon" from mortal combat. They went invisible that shit had me shook as a kid. Also I was terrified of a dinosaur falling through a crack in time and eating me. Apparently Daemons and Undead are silly but dino's falling through a crack in time. Well thats just science my friend. Thats just science.
---
Cross-server, lfr, lfg, major buffs, nerfed mobs, just made this feel like a single player game.
---
Ruined the community.
---
They did not exist for 2.5. I have a very solid memory of these images! I’d go on the site everyday and daydream 
---
&gt; but people so easily flip-flop to forgiveness over the smallest things 
---
So...having 6 phases instead 4 is a small thing? And having loot trading in raids only is a small thing?
---
We aren't flip-flopping over "small" things. We are over BIG things.
---
The fact they they are listening is already BIG enough to give them credit where credit is due.

Seriously though, that's the beauty of it. Why stick to just PvP/PvE aspects of the game, when you can enjoy RP *and* watch these people viciously and verbally murder each other year in and year out over made-up storylines?
---
No joking, I live for it. 
---
Does it really cost much more though? Maybe there will be slightly more reports than a non-RP server but otherwise isn't it just putting an RP in front of the PvP and writing up some rules?
---
How is this a bad thing to argue or discuss about? 
---
&gt; How do systems like loot rolls and DKP work without loot trading?
---
Loot rolls were final. If Shaman 1 and Shaman 2 both roll need on an item and Shaman 2 wins it, but realizes that he does not actually *need* it and it's better for Shaman 1, they can submit a GM ticket and wait several days for the loot to be traded.
---
DKP systems worked with the Master Looter setting. Shaman 1 is willing to spend more DKP on a mace than Shaman 2? Shaman 1 gets the item. If the Master Looter accidentally gives the item to Shaman 2 instead, they can submit a GM ticket to have the item moved.
---
Loot trading just removes GM from the process.
---
The tauren (warrior I guess?) with the paladin T0 cracked me up. Nice forshadowing of what's to come.

Some 5 man bosses are ?? Skulls. Which count as 63
---
Well, they are, but BiS lists are for raiding, where they are not.
---
Prevailing mentality just because some people talked about it. 
---
Kind of strange for anyone, out of all QoL additions in retail, to die on this hill. Within the context you provided, their compromise for Classic makes sense.
---
If anything, this little episode should reinforce the idea that Classic IS NOT Vanilla. 
---
Oh yeah it will be fully abuseable in raids by organized groups but if you spend your DKP on that cloak then you wont have enough for another, If you are just using need &gt; greed then 2 people in the raid got an upgrade, Good stuff. 
---
Loot trading is a way to publicly say "no reserves" when half the raid fully intends on trading it to their bro if they win the roll.
---
Of all the suggestions for loot trading (some of which were dumb) this does indeed seem to hit the gold.
---
Hey when you said that you implied that......  no, no it's nothing. It can't be..... you wouldn't......
---
Stay away from my loot! Your username is increasingly ominous the more i think about it!
---
This is great for 5 mans, still suspect for raids though(particularly PUGs). Where a few players could collaborate to roll on the same item with the agreement that the winner will give it to a specific person. You just gotta hope you’re not rolling with shitheads. But I’ve seen shit like this before happen even without loot trading on private servers lol.. a hunter in our guild won a roll against another hunter in the host guild for fang of the faceless.. so then a rogue in their guild rolled and rolled higher than my guild mate. But rather than loot the item to the rogue they looted it to the original hunter in their guild that lost the roll. The logic was “I passed to him.” So the rogue rolled with zero intent of actually ever equipping the weapon but rather as a second roll for his guild mate. Which is brutally corrupt but w/e.. I plan on joining a guild anyways so hopefully I never see this kind of stuff, don’t expect it to be a common thing anyways. 
---
Sure, I can’t speak to the quality of quests, I just personally found leveling horde more streamlined. It is more of a pain to get to black rock at 60, I get that. DM is a short trip, Ony is also a short trip, plaguelands are right next to UC, and Sillithus...well, that just sucks for everyone really lol
---
But you could loot trade in vanilla, it just took a GM. Yet by your own admission, you didn't see loot trading abuse until Cataclysm, because of the anonymity offered by LFR. So there's no reason to think people would abuse loot trading to that extent in Classic, considering the return to a system where you can easily get a bad reputation.
---
Tab targeting cycles closest to furthest. And will only go in the circle unless position drastically changed. If you have target of target on it is very easy to see when you need to stop pressing tab
---
did they ever confirm if UBRS will be 15 or 10 man, and if Strat/Scholo will be raids or not?
---
Have fun waiting days, and still be refused.
---
The second paragraph literally says: "There was once a time in this game where melee could hit targets 30 and 40 levels higher than them, and there was no issue."
---
When else besides vanilla was this ever true? And regarding you saying that you "remember being able to kill higher levels", that is still true when today. But I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about how it's virtually impossible for a player to land a hit on another player if the difference is 16 levels or more. The level 60 vs. the 20 level 25s. 
---
There literally was a time when that fight could take place and the level 60 die. Which would actually make sense. But that's not the case anyone nor was it the case by patch 1.12
---
Regardless of how I (and others) remember it, what are thoughts about this system? Would you prefer that system (where very low level players could, more often then not, land hits on very high level players) over the current system (a less then 1% chance to get a hit on a player 20 levels higher then you)?
---
Says the person who was arguing loot trading was not a big deal to me. HAHAHA feels so good to be right, just funny to see you as someone who goes with the flow and follows everyone else now that you're suddenly for it 
---
It shouldn't be an issue as long as you dont plan on puging raids, If you plan to only pug raids it might be an issue for you. 
---
All this info coming out has to mean something, maybe they're pretty much past getting the game to work and moving on to nailing down these sorts of questions
---
I hope they're still sticking to core values. People giving feedback right now are the more hardcore or dedicated crowd.
---
People with no sense for game design is gonna roll in at release and demand all sorts of stupid shit like "I PAY A SUBSCRIPTION I SHOULD SEE ALL THE CONTENT".
---
On your separate note, I can’t disagree more! I think warriors are by far the worst and the only way hunters could be upgraded on the same design is to make the gloves bulkier. But that’s viewing it on the Tauren. Maybe on other races it looks lame, but to each his own
---
Berserking does not increase casting speed, only melee.
---
his vid is older than your post, you failed
---
2 hours is pretty generous, but still solves random issues that can come up. Server crashes, disconnects, etc. Lots of shit can just get in the way and the larger window just helps reduce GM tickets further. 
---
&gt;For example, if I got a cloak upgrade early in Naxx, I would leave it unequipped and then get the better cloak from KT and trade the lesser one to someone else.
---
This can happen, yes.
---
 Kaivax :
---
***The answer to the UBRS question is: loot trading will be available in content that has a raid lock. UBRS will not have a raid lock.***
---
problem is the 49 queue is so freaking long
---
thats why most people prefer 19 cuz thats the main lowbie pvp scene
---
If you are interested in stuff about retail you google "wow" instead of "bfa" anyways
---
Obviously some people would prefer that Classic would be Vanilla, but this is a great compromise. Keeps the good aspects to the QoL while not adding the problems of it. And even then this QoL change is being made for the express purpose of keeping GM tickets in check, since the function was available in Vanilla, though only through GM tickets. All in all this was probably the best we could have hoped for from Blizz, outside of them going "we decided no loot trading"
---
The only thing i'm slightly worried about with playing on an RP server is that there might not be the option to merge it if there is only one and it dies.   
---
Hopefully there is enough interest for it so it wont be a problem. Also people rolling on an RP server might be less likely to be tourists.
---
How is it racist to call a druid dudu?
---
I think it is. Haven't seen that spec before. Thanks!
---
Here is the reality of what's ganna happen.
---
Assuming NO Battlegroups, players go in only for rep grinding, and as such Alliance wins the base zerg race every time and people stop playing AV after they get exalted.
---
The only way this will change is if any group of horde players who don't care for Honor Grinding or Rep defend in 1 of 2 places and forces the game to last as long as they can hold out while their Horde teammates yell at them for delaying a loss rather than actually pushing for a win.
---
minumum of 10 players per faction either afk'ing or fishing.
---
They are literally two separate dev teams.
---
Preston here is fucking squirrels.
---
I think those retail tourists are going to stay. Classic wow has pull and gravity. In a way retail does not. By this I mean unlike on retail where most players don't have a list of people they are waiting to play with. In classic you will 100% have that. The pull of you missing that group will soon drown out any gameplay advances you think are better about retail.
---
Tauren hunter ftw 
---
Lesser Magic Wand is the butter that smoothes early warlock and especially priest lvls. The real MVP.
---
I grew up playing Diablo so no... actually I remember I dodged WoW for a long time because I said it looks to “childish” so I started playing Guild Wars 2. Quit &amp; came to WoW eventually though.. 
---
isnt enha better with the pendulum of doom?
---
Poor me :(
---
I think it’s less the support and more the server costs. While Blizz does use their own custom cloud architecture which brings costs down, I’m fairly certain WoW has to pay for a good chunk of it since they need to hold on to their resources indefinitely. The rest of their games can grab and release stuff as needed, but once a WoW server goes up it will be there forever. Doubly so once Classic moves out of its sharding days as the single servers (which will essentially just be “sharded” but with only 1 shard) will likely use more resources than a standard retail shard. 
---
No word about that but if ist's going be 1.12 then it's:   
---
UBRS - 10 man   
---
Stratholme - 5 man   
---
Scholomance - 5 man
---
You have to take into consideration accidental disconnects, power failures, anything that could make a player being unable to log back in due time.
---
Sure, it could be ANY OTHER time frame, but 2 hours seems to be enough to cover all the loose ends.
---
You can not use potions however
---
I just want right-click ignore. It's not a default feature in Vanilla, and typing out /ignore [name] for every gat-dang gold seller is just a pain.
---
Well yeah... The game is less than 6 months off, that is not long at all. From the writing its clear that the only reason the loot trading is changing is becasue we kicked up a stink like we should when we are just told "loot trading will be in the game" and nothing more. 
---
Im happy about this change its great id still prefer no loot trading but what ever, This removes my big issue with it. No need to complain about it myself anymore but yeah Blizzard only changed this due to the reaction. 
---
Fem troll bloodfang, make a difference in Azeroth 
---
oh, no, i'm perhaps not being clear. I just don't care for the "dudu" term for druids, but it's not racist at all.
---
However, every private server i tried had rampant racism, homophobia , and anti-semitism in the public chats with no  moderation. I'm really hoping the moderation that occurs in the chats on an official server will cull enough of the crowd that maybe we can cleanse ourselves of the less serious, but annoying to me, use of the term "dudu"
---
/u/Kaivax never seen you before but I like you already
---
The original site did not have the PvP sets. This is from the original wow website
---
You're not likely to get OP to understand anything other than what they want to.  Their attitude is very apparent.
---
While you'll definitely be able to see the difference between a great item and a mediocre item, Warlocks in PvP aren't gear dependant (almost) at all. I mean, compared to the other classes.
---
It's not like it was hard to fill a group with reserves, though. If you have enough people to abuse loot trading you probably already have enough to do UBRS by yourselves and just want the extra warm bodies to make the run a little faster. 
---
Did you play Priest in vanilla? It was pure suffering. Every encounter with Paladins was futile, even if you had friends to try and peel for you. Wand life. Urgh.
---
nice, now remove sharding and reports and we fine
---
Please god that would be sweet. From 4 issues down to 2 in the span of 2 blue posts. 
---
I know you're joking, but if by the small chance you're not, you can pay me by subbing to Esfand. :) 
---
Gnome for the intellect buff racial
---
Id hope and assume that ticket would be binned instantly without a proper look over as it should be. 
---
##2edgy4me
---
&gt; If anything, this little episode should reinforce the idea that Classic IS NOT Vanilla. 
---
Everyone already KNOWS that...
---
uldaman has a 10man limit?!
---
Np. The problem of loot misallocation is going to exist. We all know that. This solution is probably the best we could've hoped for.
---
is it though? i remember all the way up to wotlk actually pvping with weapons i had no weapon skill on and not being able to land anything
---
Agreed. This keeps authenticity, decreases the "bully/corrupt" looting possiblity in 5mans AND adds quality of life in Raids. 
---
Its really really solid imo.
---
Just one suggestion, I think you should maintain the selection of the class when the race selection is changed
---
It will likely be decided by how you set your group up and not the dungeon itself?
---
No, because this guy is stomping his feet and demanding a release date for something that he isn't entitled to, and is hardly being charged for.
---
I would highly suggest switching to prot in your early 50's and just working on 5 mans to polish out your feel for pulls and pathing the group.  In Classic the tank is the baby sitter to all the other 4.
---
Question, if I am a hunter and my friend is a hunter and we both join a roll basked pug of MC.  Could we both choose not to wear our current MC gear to make it look like we don't have the pieces we need and trade our winnings among each other to maximize our chances of getting gear?
---
Grlgrlrlrlrlgrlglrl there sailor.
---
There's always going to be a certain group who complain about which version of AV to implement, or when to release Dire Maul, or which QoL features from retail should never touch Classic. 
---
No, my theory is that they, "want to provide an authentic Vanilla experience" but purposefully say that these non-vanilla aspects will be put into Classic, knowing that the community will speak out against it. Then they retract what they say, say that the community changed their minds, and now they look like the good guys when in reality they were going to do that whether anyone made a commotion or not.
---
What's your alternative solution to sharding?
---
The main point of contention was that blizz didn't have the staff to support tickets like they used to in vanilla for items, so this should compensate for that while not intruding and causing problems in other areas.
---
Many of us were like, 11, coming here our first time. I hate anything scary/horror. I sometimes cover my ears and close my eyes during trailers for a horror movie when I'm at the movie theater, would never even consider playing something like the latest installment of Resident Evil. It's hard to just watch it on stream.
---
I back cap Snowfall.
---
Pretty sure battle shout giving more threat than demoralizing was a thing.  I recall always doing it over dem anyways.
---
Immune to teleport and aggro clear in that fight, everyone else is constantly aggro reset so eventually the vw has a massive lead in aggro.
---
So the cause of and solution to all of our problems is complaining...
---
&gt;First, LFR wasn't in vanilla, so it seems pretty irrelevant here. People abused the anonymity of LFR to ninja items, but LFR won't be in Classic WoW, so that isn't relevant.
---
Ok? Whats your point? LFR wasnt in classic and wont be so people wont abuse this abuseable system in dungeons? If I would everyone would.
---
&gt;Second, according to this post, raids will still have loot trading. So according to you, this really didn't even fix anything, as raids were where you are more likely to encounter ninjas.
---
Settle down into a guild, Guild abusing loot rules? Find a new guild. It still sucks very much for PUG raiders I guess and thats a shame. 
---
cyka byat
---
The original wow website didn’t have 2.5. He would have to render it himself if he were to do that 
---
&gt; Its not like it will never drop again 
---
True...except that next time it drops can be in 4-5 weeks. Classic is not Retail. Loot is not under every rock and inside every boar you kill.
---
A missclick from the Master Looter in Classic is not something that can be easily fixed...unless loot trading is in.
---
Also no sharding is a request from many people
---
Not exactly a fair comparison, just because someone searching for current WoW may not necessarily type exactly 'wow bfa'. They may just type 'wow' or 'bfa' or some other term
---
Simply the best possible solution! Well done!
---
With this change, becomes much better.
---
Exactly this, I plan to take time off work for launch grind and want to play on RPPVP but if its not there for launch I wont be able to make the same commitment again
---
I found this https://legacyplayers.com/Tools/Designer/ but you have to use it in conjunction with like WoWhead or some other website to find item/enchant IDs 
---
Yup, cross realm BGs are in my opinion the first step towards retail wow as we see it today. This is honestly the closest thing to a deal breaker for me.
---
Hearing this makes me feel that there could be a chance of them making servers bigger and stronger to not need to implement sharding. Delusional thoughts are now becoming less delusional.
---
Out of the loop. In what way could 5 man groups collude to abuse loot trading?
---
Well I remember landing everything as much as I should from retail classic. As well all pservers I've seen also do this
---
Flying mounts were fine with worlds designed around them. TBC and Wrath both made you beat their continents on ground before letting you fly and retained their sense of community with hub cities. The problem is that Kalimdor/EK were never designed with flyers in mind and suffered as a result. 
---
dwarf or gnome helps deal with warriors and mages
---
nothing will be great in every situation anyway
---
Fair enough. I would be inclined to agree. I've stated a few times on this sub that Vanilla is not "this number is this" "this spec performs like this" "this ability does this" "this mechanic is this". Vanilla was no flying, no name changing, no teleporting to dungeons, original classes, original content, original pvp and server community.
---
I truly think that for all the good private servers have done toward getting us classic, it is tainted by just as many flaws. You have so many people screeching 1.12 is Vanilla. Anything else isn't. The 1.12 power structure and hierarchy that didn't exist for most of Vanilla. You have people citing mechanics or interactions from private servers that are just flat out wrong from live.
---
I do believe that there are still some talented people working at Blizzard and they could probably do a bunch of cool stuff in the spirit of Vanilla if management got the fuck out of their way. I tentatively trust most of what they want to try until proven otherwise. I, again, would just not really consider older WoW a current Blizzard IP. Retail is the brainchild of the third generation of Blizzard employees. I am looking forward to Classic, which is essentially an omage. I just want to see it succeed, and I regrettably don't think a lot of people on this sub and the forums would agree with that sentiment if their idealized version of WoW isn't made.
---
Managed to make it under 10min. Niccceeeeeee
---
&gt; Shamans would most likely have a similar pop to druids.
---
Actually it's lower than druids but mostly because one faction.
---
These people are giving you incorrect info. For AOE spells you will only get a proc chance per cast. That being said for Arcane missle it is for each piece of damage. Arcane is a popular leveling spec for lazy people for this reaosn.
---
Lol
---
What was there before today sounded a lot better to me. Certainly not the best I was hoping for. 
---
Youre right.  Thats much more plausible than my theory that a company giving its customers what it wants has more return customers.  
---
THANK YOU!
---
if you combine hunter pet+warlock pet with cc from mage+rogue+hunter+warlock you will probably be able to do every single dungeon without much problem
---
I haven’t tried enh for twinking but I hear good things. I just don’t like being so easily kited as enh. Ele doesn’t deal with those issues.
---
Private server player spotted.
---
Yup, and thats the concern people dont seem to care about.
---
GM did not always give you loot back. Ninja looting could be hidden well. The "hunter items are all items" did not come from nowhere. Warriors were taking great staffs that did give them slight bonus dmg but were a much bigger upgrade for casters. Same goes for the already mentioned hunters. Hybrid class going for all roles during lvling would take dps, heal and tank items. 
---
I don't understand your claim that people wouldn't abuse loot trading in Classic. I would abuse it to the maximum while pugging anything with my friends. I don't care about rep since I know will be playing in a closed circle and I know there are many people like me. That's not something I will be able to do anymore and thank the old gods for that. Even I realize it wouldn't be fun in the long term.
---
I'm opposite. I'd see a 52/48 split and jump on the 48% side asap... as long as it's alliance.
---
Not a subject I really care about anyway but now I wonder if they’ll even bother spending resources to have GMs fix loot mistakes or you’ll just be screwed if your group makes an honest mistake. With all the layoffs toward social relations lately I can’t imagine they will have sufficient customer care to handle some of the issues that will be fairly common in this older version of the game.
---
Ah, I see, ty for the answer.
---
BUT BUT BUT, HOW WILL MY 3 FRIENDS AND I SCAM PEOPLE OUT OF LOOT NOW?!?!?!?
---
Joking aside this is a great change! Even better than just having loot trading be a thing if master loot was on, as that could be be used in a 5 man to scam people
---
Strat and Scholo will be in their man version in Classic. I'm used to running UBRS with a ML though. UBRS will always have loot drama every single run anyways
---
Mara for sure. DM probably.
---
Your nickname should've been Xxxhutnerxxx
---
That feels like a terrible idea. Well, not terrible, but one of those "good in theory, awful in practice" ideas.
---
Showing a server needs more alliance will just push alliance players away from it, because nobody wants to play on a server where they are outnumbered heavily and therefore will be preyed upon. Rather than balancing the factions out, your idea will cement the imbalances even further.
---
?
---
Improved Drain Soul for example for farming purposes. For a pure PvE player it's more useful than CoE, imo.
---
It is because you aren't able to think.
---
Worry not, many people aren't.
---
Given it's not live yet it's easier to incorporate these things I guess. Certainly is refreshing though.
---
I don't need someone to tell me that if I choose to go RP, then I can't be on a PvP server where everyone is flagged for PvP all the time. PvP is a game dynamic, RP is just how players communicate. It's possible to have both and I would like to have the option to enjoy WoW that way.
---
&gt;why would you avoid a server where your faction is 40 to 60
---
You’ll learn when you enter STV
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pyz2UPkvCo
---
Yeah im not saying it's a bad thing at all.  Just saying it can and will be abused for that purpose far more than it will be used to rectify mistakes. 
---
That's fine with me, but it might not be for some of the purists
---
"HURR SOMEONE DISAGREE MUCH DUMB HURRR I SMURT DISAGREE DUMB HURR"
---
Not to mention, I think most people searching for current WoW would just type in "wow."
---
The racism will go away in large part when they wall off other countries. It's the nationalism that normally starts that rabbit trail. Racism is just one of it's many stops.
---
Sure, I kite moving forward or sideways as a mage too. But sometimes you just need to back up to get around something blocking your way or get out of some aoe just infront of you. Turning your mouse 90°, sidestep and then 90° again is gonna be slower than the small S correction. But you are right that S should be avoided as much as possible. 
---
Only raid lock outs, UBRS wont be hit but PUG raiders will. I wish they would implement a system where if I wanted to achive a goal and other people also wanted to achive that same goal we could like form a pact or like a clan or something. 
---
Yeah something always felt wrong about flying mounts. 
---
The draw and immersion is when you have to take the dangerous and bandit ridden path. Or secure guides (friends) and if all else fails - ask Gary the mage to open you up a portal for some spare change.
---
It's even 43%! Since someone gets 130% and you need 10% over that it's 130%*1.1=143%, so when the lock takes aggro from the vw you might as well send it to another mob, it's not getting aggro back quickly
---
You bastard
---
Don't blame me, I can't read. 
---
Dual wield was a mistake.
---
Yeah, that request is DOA, though. 
---
Is this not just Kargoz's guide? I know he's credited but it seems like a copy paste of it? 
---
Isn't progressive itemization confirmed?
---
Oh boy. Spending 30 hours leveling and gearing, hundreds of gold on enchants so you can walk around at like 50% stealth movespeed hoping someone was dumb enough to queue with a clothie.
---
Tips has an 8-minute video... he needs to get with the program
---
1.12 is generally what people remember, which included miss chance on higher level players.
---
Your preference has no place here. People want the game restored, not remastered.
---
&gt; The answer to the UBRS question is: loot trading will be available in content that has a raid lock. UBRS will not have a raid lock.
---
&gt; A big part of loot trading (in a 2-hour window) as a solution to a concern is that raid locks require you to wait a week (or 3 days) before you can try again for the loot that was accidentally given to the wrong person.
---
([Source](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/loot-trading-in-classic/131586/111))
---
Wrath made Dungeons trivial content, together with raids being optional 10 or 25 man, more people were engaged in raiding. This was probably the intent on Blizzards end. (Ulduar and ICC were good, so I won't complain about the time I spent in Wrath).
---
The moving of NAXX to Northrend to get more players experiencing the nerfed version is probably the clearest sign of Blizzard wanting more players to experience more of the content. It was pretty much the stepping stone towards LFR. 
---
I just hope that the people going into Classic realize how different some aspects of the game were.
---
Except the game is Blizzard's and they wanted loot trading to be available to players DIRECTLY, and not through ticketing and DAYS of waiting.
---
Blizzard announced loot trading, and it was CLEAR that they won't budge on it.
---
The FACT that they compromised, is MORE than we could expected...hence, it is SO MUCH BETTER than loot trading all over the place.
---
Also, this compromise makes loot MISTAKES (yes, those WILL happen) being fixable much faster, by players. If anything, this is a much better option for loot trading than Vanilla loot trading....WHICH was a thing.
---
The amount of people that this concept is lost on still amazes me. That and fresh recruits expecting to get fully decked out in a single raid cause they need the gear 'more'.
---
So go get some warm bodies, then -  loot trading promotes a system of dishonesty &amp; lack of transparency that I don't want to be associated with while I'm trying to enjoy the game.
---
&gt;  Soulbound loot that drops in five-person content will not be tradeable at any time
---
I did in other points in this thread.  Screech is a spammable ability that generates AoE threat.  Not as much on one hit as a Gorilla, but much more over the course of a fight, and usable from fight to fight.
---
More good new and more confirmation that the Classic team is listening to the community. With the recent influx of news, I'm expecting an Alpha/Beta announcement in the next few weeks.
---
If anything it just means more drama to enjoy since they cant hide ninja looting behind getting a GM to send it to their friend. 
---
Yes.  Everything generates threat.  Buffs and debuffs both generate threat.  Even if you get in combat while drinking, the mana regen from drinking generates threat.
---
Looks great mate!
---
This is why im an esfan !

dust2 was my humble abode.
---
I take back the "humble" part.
---
Try again without contridicting yourself.
---
Why did he run into melee so often when he could have maintained shooting distance? For wing clip? Doesn't seem like the smart thing to do vs a warrior. Genuinely curious if anyone is familiar with the playstyle.
---
People overwhelming want good, exciting world PvP, something missing in the retail game. Since world PvP by patch 1.12 was generally garbage, that's what they'll get. Gotta take the bad with the good I guess. 
---
Imagine being so pathetic you typed this out breathlessly. Then thought to yourself. Yea this is good, people will respect me for my edgy nihilism. Maybe take a few less anarcho communist classes. Shits a damn paradox anyway.
---
rip MC pug
---
Nice video! Back when world PvP was exciting!
---
How come none of these idiots aren't bringing up the fact this video is under 10 minutes?
---
Hunter, druid or priest.
---
Hunter solos anything, prints money soloing dungeons. Druid has an easy time finding groups, the least gear competition if you plan on raiding. Priest is good with low investment, popular though, raid gear will be a pain to get.
---
That's why there are diminishing returns on CC spells - the first spell lasts for (up to) the full duration, the second lasts for (up to) 50%, the third lasts for (up to) 25%. After that your target becomes immune to that CC for some time (until you're out of combat? I'm not sure). 
---
&gt; What's your alternative solution to sharding?
---
The only solutions to sharding are either #changes, dead servers, or ridiculous login queues
---
Thank you so much ❤️
---
And maybe they will react to that and announce something. If they don't think it's enough they will  hold off on it. They are at least open to it. That should be enough for us to know.
---
If you believe that retail bosses are harder than Vanilla bosses, you are gonna be in for a rude awakening come Summer.
---
level 60 wPvP was just as important as lowbie wPvP. 
---
In terms of wPvP you could never "beat" the continents. You should never be allowed to just skip roadblocks by mounting up and flying past them.
---
Yes this 100% and a nice solution
---
please remove his balls from your mouth before proceeding
---
It’s classic wow, without that stuff it just wouldn’t be the same. No changes.
---
&gt; Flying mounts were fine with worlds designed around them.
---
On PvE servers I guess that is reasonable but it kinda ruined world pvp.
---
As someone who plans on getting two 60s and torn between mage-warlock-shaman.... This might have made my decision easier
---
He, south vietnam. I tried it on pservers. Can always go quest somewhere else if it gets too bad. Besides that's just part of the experience. I think i'd rather play the minority faction in any case. 
---
Yep, weapon skill is always level*5 in PvP. You might be able to increase it with gear, I'm not sure about that. 
---
Neat idea, more of a real RPG approach with depth. 
---
Why is everyone saying it’s an impossible question if there’s a formula then? 
---
Waiting for a loot fix &gt; Having a ninja steal your.
---
Be fucking patient, a few days to a week is NOTHING in terms of the the overall vanilla journey.
---
Same, as long as it's not too imbalanced. If it's too imbalanced though (like 65/35), you can kiss world bosses goodbye.
---
What is your opinion on what happens to your current pet when you summon a new one?
---
&gt;PVP servers are like a containment board and PVE is only slightly better depending on the pop size.
---
Ah, right. An elitist.
---
Haven’t they already confirmed progressive itemization? I think they mentioned it in the 6 phase blue post. 
---
Awesome thanks!!!
---
It works on private servers. Fucking naked warriors partroling Booty Bay and Gadget looking for unsuspecting hunters and warlocks.
---
Who knows if it will be in the gane though.
---
WE WANT RPPVP AT LAUNCH MAKE IT HAPPEN BLIZZ
---
How... How could anyone missclick loot to the wrong person? Even at fucking 15 you learn to check then double check stuff you care about. You guys were either getting diddled by your GM or you need to sit him down and name a new master looter. 
---
Still would prefer no loot trading but hey this is a much better system and my only real issues with loot trading was dungeons becasue ill be guild raiding. 
---
Mor'Ladim still gives me nightmares
---
NICE!
---
Amazing :D
---
What is going on??! It's like Blizzard are actually listening to feedback??
---
Given the lack of feedback acknowledgment that went on with bfa this is a breath of fresh air. Logical solutions to community feedback.
---
It's like the classic team is comprised of people actually thinking through each problem without any constraints.  Makes you wonder what goes on behind the scenes on other projects that leads to decisions that are so against the commonly accepted best choice.  
---
Guess I'll stop worrying about it though and just enjoy the continuous stream of good news.
---
I've never played on a private server nor had any interest in doing same. I'm here strictly because I'm excited about Classic, and from the moment it was announced it was my intent to roll on an RPvP server. Moreover, this is really the only place I *can* make any noise about this, as I have no interest in BfA and hence don't have an active WoW sub, meaning I can't make my voice heard on the issue on the official forums.
---
Granted, anecdotes are not necessarily data, but I suspect I'm hardly the only one for whom this is true around here.
---
That's exactly my point.. I'm already going in prepared with a guild but I'm speaking to the other probably 30% or more of people who will be straight up pugging MC maybw BWL as well, It's a good change from the previous Loot Trading but it still comes with problems.
---
&gt;Pros:
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Very easy leveling 
---
&gt;Low skill floor but high ceiling both in pvp and pve
---
&gt;Tier 1/2 gear is actually really nice
---
&gt;very good pvp as pve spec/gear but also has pvp specs for extra advantages
---
&gt;Pretty fun in WSG
---
&gt;Good money makers
---
&gt;Cons:
---
&gt;They don't really do the best dps, mc/bwl you do alright dps, 
---
Errr what? They are top tier DPS in MC and not far behind in BWL.
---

---
It's just as easy on live. It's a simple patch fix that's deployed on patch days.
---
You literally just clicked those green bars at the right. It showed you the health of people that are in range missing health. When you clicked it picked the correct spell and started healing them.
---
With decursive above you literally only had to click either the emergency monitor or the decursive bar. 
---
10 / 10 for being a lightwell priest though.
---
if you have any ranged dps, let them open up on a single designated target (probably skull marker) and taunt it as it's getting blasted down. If your taunt hits a mob somewhere at around 50% hp it'll most likely die before you lose aggro, leaving you having spent only taunt to keep a mob on you till death.
---
There's a lot of free threat in using taunt correctly.
---
Sure but it's an underhanded scummy thing to do.  
---
It's a game my dude just play and have fun.
---
Alleria represent, recognize so many names here.
---
How many of the people that voted that way were memeing though?
---
Their plan is "no changes" to game mechanics &amp; strategies from the original 1.12 game. There has been no mention about changing how hunters interact with DM N or Mara, that I'm aware of.
---
You'll still get a ton of people in each starting zone shard. If you're thinking you'll only see 12 or so people in your shard... that's not how it works.
---
Either way, dynamic respawns is much, *much* worse of a solution and even further from feeling like vanilla; DR you *very clearly* see, and sharding you don't.
---
Killing mobs in vanilla was hard. Depending on your class, 2 mobs at once is tough. 3 mobs and you're probably going to have to run. 4 mobs and you wont make it far enough.
---
Now with dynamic respawns, shit has a tendency to respawn on top of you. So imagine that you just killed 2 mobs and are sitting at maybe 30% HP. Then those two mobs respawn on your face because, yay, dynamic respawns! Now you're dead.
---
Sharding isn't even about resource competition, not fully. The point is to avoid having dead servers a month after launch when all the tourism has died down.
---
Yes, as much as it annoys me to be ganked for the 5th time trying to hand in the fucking quest at Nesingwary's, I still wouldn't want it any other way. As long as there is faction balance you can always call in some reinforcements. 
---
I think there's a difference between complaining and valid criticism. One is healthy and the other one isn't. But idk, maybe just keep doing what we're doing. It's getting responses.
---
I usually play a mage or warrior. A mage because I like being able to help out the group, whether with PM, frost nova, snare/blink to kite, and also of course dd to burn down mobs. I feel like a good mage is a huge benefit to a group in a dungeon.
---
What about Warlocks? Do they have similar utilities to employ? I view them as less 'in the moment' utility, and more an overall utility with their summons, healthstones, rez buff (forget the name), and pets. I know they also have targeted &amp; ae fear, and can banish demons.
---
How else can a warlock can help out a group in a tight spot?
---
Just gonna throw this out there... pvp in classic is fucking retarded. Most people claiming otherwise either never played classic or sucked dick while it was going on and need a redo. 
---
Gear is what matters. Right after bwl was released I managed to get lucky and grab a full 8pc netherwind... had it proc 8 times in a row in AV literally 2 shotting people at the time... such skill? You can kite and kill warriors with rank 1 frostbolt and backpeddles... rolling 2mil dmg + ignites with crit stacking. The list goes on. Wow pvp is a dead horse, please stop kicking it. 
---
What is the addon for the info bar up top called?
---
BfA is nothing like Classic, and if you get used to many of the quality of life features and conveniences it has for your first experience, you may not end up liking Classic.  
---
I'd recommend wait, but if you really can't at least do a private server for Vanilla.
---
This makes me very happy. If only Blizzard listened to their community on all products (RIP BFA). The attention we're getting makes me certain that Blizzard is aware of how profitable and reinvigorating Classic will be for their entire brand. If the flocks of content creators migrating to make Classic WoW content didn't already make that apparent I really don't know what else would.
---
Exactly , this is going to be a huge issue for pickup raids , after all player base lose this and the only benefit is blizzard need less muscle to deal with tickets.
---
No, they won't compete for rank 14, of course not. But they will compete for rankings.
---
Without cross BGs, they'd not compete at all. At least this way they'll have a shot at maybe rank 9-10
---
Yup, and they all are far worse options. I just like asking people who are against sharding what their proposed solution would be.
---
The strat on alliance was for warriors to kite around in circles (like an ice rink type situation) slowing and aggro'ing mobs while you did the eggs. Our warriors weren't good enough to pull it off, so we just started killing everything. What we lacked in skillful gameplay we evidently made up in massive deeps, because when we changed strats we breezed right through it. 
---
The rest of BWL was really easy compared to Razorgore from what I recall. Also, I have no idea what the modern strat is for Razorgore, maybe now that people are generally more minmaxer the strat actually is to kill everything.
---
It even has the same old macros that won't work with the new client.
---
Yea I can tell you I was one of the 50% pipe dreamers before. Shaman is not worth the hype at all. Which is why they are treated like golden sun gods by their raids. One nice thing to consider is that the shaman is kinda like the pot head class of the horde. Unlike everyone else you can get away with space cadet antics and no one will do anything about it because WF totem. lol.
---
Shaman should stay in that contention.   The shaman nerf applied to melee, so if you were considering warrior-rogue-shaman it would eliminate shaman.   
---
Once you put the gear on, can you not trade it anymore?  Not sure how it works on retail.
---
I am debating the cow. Especially the rare female version.
---
the weapon which costs you more time getting it than it saves you, great choice
---
I'd argue that [this guy](https://classicdb.ch/?item=6975) was the real hero. 
---
Seems you were almost correct. Except for the MasterLooter requirement. 
---
Possibly to cover the case where the raid leader forgets to enable master looter.
---
Some of the original raid leaders might be going senile by now :D
---
Hit cap may be a big concern using healing gear but I don’t remember how important it was for pvp
---
I never played a class that had a pet so I have no opinion.... but, I think you are alluding to the fact that "all players" remembered the way warlock pets were summoned and blizzard confirmed they were all wrong. 
---
I fully realize that my memory of how vanilla wow PvP worked could be faulty which is why I included links to others verifying what I remember. Someone just posted a YouTube video of a low level hunter kiting a high level rogue (and even that video isn't definitive).
---
Only blizzard knows the truth and since classic is a way for them to step back and reverse their mistakes, I'm hoping this gets addressed. Because world PvP is fun and exciting and really is a big deal, and blizzard did ultimately ruin it within a year.
---
Opening week of AV you will have big 40 vs 40 clashes with people just mindlessly brawling, yes.
---
This mechanics is going to be an issue for pug raids , friends with same needing rights winning items dont really need to trade it to his roll loser friend 20 minutes after.
---
I think this mechanic only hurts the playerbase to only benefit the muscle blizzard needs to deal with in-game tickets.
---
A couple of hours ago I blinded a T2 hunter in Arathi Highlands who was trying to gank a lvl40 mage - my rogue is lvl38.
---
This was also by far the most common suggestion.
---
I think 30 seconds. 99% sure not after out of combat. 
---
It's two completely different games at this point. I don't think you'd learn much about vanilla from playing retail wow. I'd say wait and then you can always try retail later to see all the things that changed.   
---
That is it. Wife tool lile 10 years of classic to get good.
---
Look up the 'fury tanking explained' or whatever it is called by Skarm on YouTube. Gives a good case for when to use and not use shields.
---
Other then that you need to learn to stance dance. It's pretty damn easy already. Find macros to make it even easier.
---
They're 2 completely different games.  You would get no idea how the community works in Classic by playing BFA.
---
You sure showed him, man. Shame on people who change their opinions, right?
---
So, a 22 level difference... interesting. Did your mage friend attempt to sheep him? Maybe blind has different resistances then other abilities. 
---
I don't mind it. To me, it's not hugely important that the Rogue who I'm helping to kill is from a guild on the opposite faction of my server. I guess I never was involved to that extent the first time around in 2005-2005, so it doesn't mean as much to me now.
---
They have to rewrite alot of the code that's for sure. But that's not what I meant. What I meant is they already have:
---
\-3D assets (zones, dungeons, character models), textures and animations. They might have to convert them to the modern file system yes, but don't have to make them from scratch. They already changed old files to the new ones in WoD when CASC was implemented.
---
\-quests, lore
---
\-class gameplay with all abilites and talents
---
\-raid and dungeon encounters plus loot tables and tuning.
---
\-all reputation systems
---
\-PVP system and BGs
---
\-basically every feature of the game they know how it should be (1.12 reference build at the office)
---
do you realize how much time was needed to design, playtest and balance all of those systems back in the day? That's all work they don't have to do in the remake. Yes they have alot of work to port Classic to the new engine, but it's not like they have to make a new expansion or rewrite the game from scratch.
---
Sharding is a solution for server and network stability.  They have said that the servers going down during launch was a nightmare. They didn’t say anything about over populated questing, afaik.
---
So would you rather have shards up or servers crashing every 5 mins and no one being able to play?
---
Oh god the squirrel fucker is back 
---
My company asks us to plan our holidays until end of january, if it's a week or longer.
---
Even if you did test out retail wow it literally feels like a different game compared to Classic.  
---
Try out a private server, they’re free and will give you confirmation if you’ll like the game itself. Keep in mind, it may not be fun without all your friends and a huge growing community that Classic will actually have when it launches. This will purely be to see if you like the gameplay. 
---
Yeah, that is exactly what I'm planning on doing. A good amount of tier 2 gear for shaman is good for elemental. There's also a small amount of non tier elemental mail pieces that drop from raids that would only go to shaman as well. ZG raid quest rewards have some decent pieces. Wouldn't be bad filling up the rest of the slots with dungeon/pvp gear either.
---
&gt; decreases the "bully/corrupt" looting possiblity in 5mans AND adds quality of life in Raids.
---
Thank you for saying "decreases" and not "eliminates". Because a lot of apparently former vanilla players seem to forget how easy it is for a group leader to "steal" loot and gives it to their friends or themselves with the original rules, which will remain otherwise unchanged
---
[https://youtu.be/E1Q1\_vbApog](https://youtu.be/E1Q1_vbApog)
---
No. Progressive itemization is the changing of stats on gear over time, they said that isn't going to happen. What they said they will do is update the loot/drop tables. So if an item wasn't in game until AQ patch, then it will be added during that phase, but stats will not change over time, afaik.
---
&gt; Along the way, we’ve taken a close look at items that provide the biggest power gains, many of which were introduced in 1.10 as part of a sweeping dungeon itemization pass. That patch was when Tier 0.5 gear was introduced, and Relics were added to the drop tables of many bosses. It also adjusted drop rates and drop locations of a lot of gear (to make room for the Relics). We’ve gone back and reconstructed many of the most heavily affected drop tables as they existed prior to the 1.10 patch, and we’re planning to update the drop tables alongside the Ahn’Qiraj War Effort. Prior to the Ahn’Qiraj unlock, most of the drop rates and locations will look as they did in the patches prior to 1.10, with exceptions—there are lots of little changes made in earlier patches that don’t have a big effect on player power, and in those cases, we’re planning to use the 1.12 drop rates and locations.
---
&gt; One example of the many items we’re planning for is: Titanic Leggings, which is a world drop that first appeared in 1.10. We can confirm that it will be controlled by the same content unlock that restricts the other 1.10 loot changes.
---
Mara will probably be fine. It would be hard for them to break that fight because there really isn't any cheesing involved.
---
DM on the other hand... I doubt it will work. If it does work I hope they go out of their way to break it. The shit ruins server economy.
---
*OwO, what's this?* It's your **1st Cakeday** nonothatsimpossible! ^(hug)
---
&gt; I just hope that the people going into Classic realize how different some aspects of the game were.
---
I think most will, but there are a few who say "players are so much better now" and think they are going to steamroll Classic, it's hard to stifle a laugh
---
Tell 16th and just silently release in 15th 
---
We as a community have to be careful what we advocate for. The majority is not always right... see retail WoW.
---
I'm really digging how much they are listening though. Gives me high hopes for the project.
---
I hope that is the one they ignore. I'd rather have sharding in the starting zones than spend 8 hours trying to collect Felix's toolbox on release day. Even the 5-10 zones would be okay. Not like guilds are formed I'm those zones or anything important. You only spend 2 or 3 hours there.  
---
Get help
---
I did some stance dancing in Cata. It was fun. 
---
"Wake up sheeple" is where I stopped reading. Go away South Park Cheney.
---
Flying mounts I think were actually good for TBC and WotLK.  It's Cata when they applied it everywhere, and afterwards when they tried to get rid of them (but not actually get rid of them) that they had problems.
---
Having content built specifically around flying made them a great addition to the game, such as:
---
* Skettis
---
* Nagrand elemental plateau
---
* Tempest Keep
---
* Netherwing dailies
---
* Druid flight form
---
The fact that Storm Peaks and Icecrown were largely built around flying also made them really fun.
---
I'm not going to play, simple as that. I've known since the announcement that I wanted to play on a RpPvP server. I have a group of people who all want to play on a RpPvP server. Only RpPvP can provide the full spectrum that wow offers. Roleplaying which greatly adds to the immersion of the game which is what matters most to me as well as the open world pvp dynamic that is only present on PvP servers. Adding the RpPvP realms later is a horrible idea because by this point all the communities will have manifested on the already existing servers. Transfering is also not an option for various reasons. It would immediately invalidate most of the endgame content the server offers.
---
It was a long time ago so I could be an idiot here. Wasn't ubrs and lbrs in the same dungeon? If so how would that work. 
---
People complaining about not being able to tell when they'll get their two weeks vacation time.

[Imagine not tacking on another 1:22 to meet the 10 min quota.](https://i.imgur.com/065JcVx.png)
---
Open your eyes people, the truth is out there.
---
Yea i'd agree with that in a broad sense
---
You can go play a shitty watered down version of WoW right now. Nothing is stopping you. Why you want to water down and kill the one decent version of WoW that can exist for everyone else, is beyond me. 
---
WOOOOOOOOO!
---
It's a welcomed compromise.
---
But it' still sad that loot trading will make pug raids very unattractive. Yes, you would always have to deal with the Master Looter screwing you anyway, but with loot trading sub-groups within the raid can still increase their chances for their friends a lot. And you won't even find out about it to avoid said groups next time.
---
Oh well, I guess you can't have it all.
---
Exactly, how does Blizz want to gauge the interest in RpPvP servers if they don't have any at launch. They should just have all realm types available at launch and then add more if the demand is there.
---
I think they changed all dungeons to 5 man in 1.10 or something. Or maybe you could still do them as a raid group but you couldn't do the quests unless you were in a 5-man party. 
---
&gt; you put the gear on, can you not trade it anymore?  Not sure how it works on retail.
---
Yes if you put the gear on you can't trade it. It becomes untradeable after you equip and gives you a popup. I think the solution to this, would be to make people wear their gear after they win it in a PUG. And if they don't you'd probably just kick them.

This is the one I'm using for my druid, because dependant on the content I can tailor my gear to that.

I see you have multiple accounts you're posting this same crap on. GG.

How would  a group leader to "steal" loot and gives it to their friends or themselves with the original rules ?
---
Oh I must have misunderstood your original comment. I'm not sure how much pre 1.12 data blizzard has
---
Lmao ok kid. 
---
Boy, are you retarded?
---
 -Country sherif 
---
Master loot function is alive and well.
---
150 upvotes seems to agree so not really. 
---
The overreach of trolling from you however, is quite over the top. 
---
I personally leveled as a balance resto hybrid in retail vanilla because I legitimately didn't know what I was doing.  The first abilities you're given as a druid are balance and restoration spells so I just mostly kept doing that, firing spells from range, moonfire then go into bear form and hit the mob until dead.
---
It's definitely the slower way to level compared to what feral can do.  Your heals as a feral will be good enough to assist your hunter friend and his pet if necessary.  Once you get leader of the pack at 40 you'll also be giving him and his pet the 3% crit buff which is really nice.
---
If you're worried about healing for dungeons along the way, a feral can still do that too, just keep a set of gear for it in your bags.  Your heals won't really be that vastly different, and Heart of the Wild bonus intellect is actually pretty great considering until late game your heal gear will basically just be a lot of stuff with int and spirit on it anyway.
---
If you honestly really prefer the playstyle of balance over feral though, you should go with that.
---
If you had ever been to a private server you would have seen that the end game comtent, vanilla in this instance, has been on farm and guides/shortcuts/etc. developed for years now that pugs are not only viable but commonplace.  Some people have full rosters of "complete" characters with BIS gear.  When you only need one piece of gear then you invite alts or outsiders, with a few hard carrys.  PUGs will be the norm in a year, maybe less.  Classic isn't "world first" anymore, it's a speedrun.
---
No you got it right the first time. I want ninja looters - adds drama to the server. But you're right in that there will be ninjas to some degree so all is well
---
Oh I see, a 5-man group would simply have ML turned on and then that person would give it to their buddy. Hopefully people will see that ML is turned on for a 5-man group and simply drop. There shouldn't be a need for ML in 5man dungeons right?
---
I feel like the current plan for it is just fine, the question is just whether they stick to it or if sharding overstays its welcome.
---
Yea at this point I definitely think theyre doing and exploring everything they can to make sure they meet our expectations and requests as best as possible. It sure seems like it, as long as its within possibility. 
---
Interesting 
---
Ok. Thanks for that answer. Now I just have to find exactly where they stated that.
---
To some people that is fun. Only reason I play these kind of games is to get as good loot as possible. 
---
Vanilla is like an old war buddy. When you first showed up on the front line and met him. You knew from day one he was different then the rest. You knew he was special and you spent years in the trenches with him forming some of your best memories of him.
---
Retail is like the government called that old friend away for a secret project. When he gets back and you meet him. His eyes are dead. He has no soul. His mind has been broken and he's just a mindless super streamlined killer. It don't take long to realize this isn't your old buddy. This is some dark magic Homoculus wearing the flayed skin of your old friend.
---
Well, I guess you can assume that those who rolled on the item (despite having the item already) would just equip their already soulbound copy to fool you anyway.
---
Every solution has it's problems:
---
* The #nochanges solution makes it so that players are standing around waiting for respawns
---
* Server queues make it so players are standing around waiting to log in...before standing around waiting for respawns
---
* The sharding solution has been discussed in-depth
---
* Shared tagging would make it easier to zerg content (there's a reason they made it impossible to complete quests in a raid group) 
---
* Shared tagging and mob scaling (i.e. if you have 20 players attacking it, it has 20x the health) introduces a problem with worldbuilding (similar to sharding), and makes it feel like grouping makes you weaker
---
* Faster respawns means it's easier to be overhwelmed on a lower-pop server or if you come in after everyone else
---
* Dynamic respawns seem fine, but now they have more coding involved, and you can still get overwhelmed.  For example, if you're in Northshire Abbey and you're fighting the Defias by yourself, but there's a ton of players fighting wolves and kobolds, you can be overrun without help.  There's also the question of rare mobs and those with long respawns, if they should be faster.
---
Overall, I personally like dynamic respawns, but I've seen times when that was an issue.  And if everything has pros and cons, I'd rather err on the side of #no-changes.
---
Fury tanking really only applies to guilds using full consumables AND world buffs, in a raid they already have cleared/outgear with the intent of clearing it in a fraction of the "average" time.
---
Also the hunter's name - Akhotnik - means 'hunter' in Russian.
---
But which ladder? That's the real question!
---
So you and 3 friends all do a dungeon together. Say, 2 warriors, a rogue and a druid healer. Druid claims to be off spec healing. You guys bring along another physical DPS who would be rolling on leather. Now everyone rolls on every leather piece, except you, as a group of 4 friends, are most likely to get it, and funnel it all to 1 person. And while the random pug might get suspicious, they can't prove anything, especially if the trade is done after the run is completed. Then its 1 person's word vs 4, with no proof from either side. So the community blacklist aspect that normally harms ninjas won't be there.
---
You could also be more blatant about it with more varied classes, but either way it's hard to prove, which means it would get abused, and nobody would want to do a run where you see multiple people from the same guild.
---
I hope someone will make the [Windfury tally](https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/windfury-tally) Addon usable again,  that shit was amazing.
---
I disagree.
---
The weapon can last ~15 levels. You'll get gear doing the 3 instance requirements. The EXP rewards for the quest chain and instances are good too.
---
Last time I did it in a private server I got 2 levels on the quest alone and finished it in ~4hrs played time. 
---
Plus the quest is a bit of fun itself.
---
It may not be the most efficient way to 60 but it definitely outlasts the time spent on the quest and makes content a hell of a lot easier. Plus it really feeds the hybrid fantasy stats wise.
---
Most dungeons have 10man limit iirc
---
I often ran death mines with 8+ people back in the day, normally people just dont do it though
---
That's what it was... I couldn't remember it...Thanks.
---
I only remembered Medivh, which is the one I transferred to sometime late that summer/fall I think.
---
Had real world experience of people trying this. By the first boss it’s usually found. Often times it’s on by mistake. 
---
Players will still be able to sell loot attained in a PUG raids then. Ah well, atleast this compromise is better than nothing.
---
Well, technically he could just turn it on just as the boss with the desired loot is about to go down, though it would be pretty blatant.
---
Not important. IIRC 2% was hit cap for pvp. May be 4%?
---
Why would they even bother falsely convincing the people who hang around wow classic forums? We are a pretty small part of the playerbase you know. Most ppl won't even know about this, so it wouldn't really do anything for them.. 
---
I think it's a valid concern, but there's also a solution to it. That would be to make the person who wins loot in a a pug, put on the gear so that it gets locked to them and they can no longer trade it. If they don't do it, then you would probably just kick them out of the raid.  
---
The same concern could be had for someone winning an item, and then trying to auction it off under the table, but same solution. Just make them wear it. If they don't wear it, then you kick them and they lose their raid lockout for the weak and people on the server will more than likely hear about it.
---
At this point it would really be silly to not even have one rppvp server at launch. It requires nothing from them. From an architectural standpoint, an rppvp server is just another PvP server, but with an rp tag on the realm list. 
---
I hope they’re willing to sacrifice one PvP server to make one rppvp 
---
Larger servers and deal with the first week of discomfort in tagging mobs and login queues? It's better than allowing sharding into the game, which creates a precedence that we have to trust Blizzard not to act on.
---
Between keeping a door closed, and having it open a tiny bit, one is significantly easier to open the whole way than the other.
---
I don't want to be a bubble buster here but no you can not pvp in healing gear. Ele shamans have a BiS list that comes with AQ40. Many of the items do have +healing over damage but, you normally have them for crit. Which is a way bigger deal t a shaman. Unless you have the god gear an elemental shaman is absolute garbage. Food for the crows. They are the caster equivalent of a warrior.
---
Another consideration: How do form an accurate value for the A:H ratio?
---
* Total characters / charaters above level X
---
* Active players → What should be considered active?
---
* ???
---
This is highly missleading information
---
Mage tier 1 &amp; 2 are pretty bad I think. Like you would wear some pieces, but there's a lot of unnecessary stuff on them, and not much spell hit for example. Of course some of it is good, it's raid loot after all, but I would much prefer a game that had tier sets for each spec, or something like that, and it actually being the best gear in the raid. The non-tier raid drops could just be weapons, rings, trinkets, that sort of thing. 
---
And for warriors, even for tanks going full tier gear is not necessarily the best. Could be better switching out some pieces for dps gear to get more rage/threat. 
---
Items are all going to be 1.12. The only progressive itemization they are doing is making items added specifically in patch 1.10 not drop until they reach phase 3 or whatever.
---
Sure but you aren't more entitled to it than someone else.  That's such a childish approach to getting loot.
---
&gt; Failed to mention any of my points and how they are wrong, a common theme with people who tend to pull shit out of their ass. 
---
They are using the 7.3.5 engine. This includes modern anti-cheat and anti-bot systems and a connection to battle .net. That's the whole point of using the modern engine and not update the old 1.12 build.
---
See my comment above to see why I think most of the game was already done. That doesn't mean it's an easy or fast task to recreate Classic. 
---
I *WILL* run SFK for my Robes of Arugal, even if I'm alliance, even if it takes a dozen tries. 
---
Won’t happen. I’m pretty sure they are burning all of their resources just trying to balance shit out and getting it to work with stability. It’s a cool idea though. 
---
OMG YES! THANK GOD THEY LISTENED!
---
I don’t understand what you’re asking. You just covered all their non damaging abilities.
---
Corpse camping, ganking for griefing purposes
---
lol. im just over here pushing for an authentic classic experience. 
---
Hmm, good eye but I doubt that was the real Soda back then. If it was, he would have been 11 years old, hah.
---
Im very happy with this update. Thanks for listening!
---
And then I save my last 10 min of gameplay with Shadowplay and post it on realm forums. 
---
You're not finding any groups on your realm anymore. Go ahead and name change.
---
I believe he was just closing the gap to deny the warrior an intercept stun.
---
Given the current state of BFA and Blizzard's over decade long track record? Many, many more.
---
Fantastic. A very good and sensible middle ground. Raids are for the most part guilds that do, there are pugs of course but the potential for abuse is imo a lot lower in raids.
---
It could possibly be something for them to do further down the line, maybe even after releasing Naxx.
---
Most people will just say the important items are reserved so you won't have a chance of getting it anyway.  There's also the chance that they turn ml on at the last second before the boss dies to take the items for themselves or their friend. 
---
Would wearing bad gear for an entire raid in the hopes of getting an upgrade for your friend that may or may not drop and you still may or may not win really be optimal?  If you are hurting your DPS or what not.  Depends on what you're wearing I guess.  
---
I was one of the leaders in an alliance guild on a pserver recently and both kiting and killing strats are used, really is dependent on having enough to dps to burn the dragonkin down before healers run out of mana prior to entering phase 2.
---
From my experience, the most reliable strategy there was to split into 2 groups on the controller platform ramps, with hunters being used to pull dragonkin from the far corners to the tanks.  DPS is split on the ramps, and just burns everything down.
---
Given Blizzard's current state with communication/listening and changes to the Classic Project?
---
LMAO. sometimes true shit is hard to hear
---
I'm happy to have right click reporting. If private servers are any indication of the quality of human i'm going to be interacting with reporting shitty people quickly will save everyone a whole fuck load of time.
---
*Come on let's go, to the game we've longed*
---
If this is something that becomes common practice (which I highly doubt) then there isn't much of a community to begin with. 
---
But I say if it wasn't in vanilla then it shouldn't be in classic.   
---
That's being held up against Blizzard over the past decade+ and what they did to WoW during that time.
---
I would LOVE it to happen 😊
---
If you get into a group and Master Loot is on and you dont leave immediately, theyre not the assholes, you are. Find another group!       
---
        
---
I can only feel so sorry for peoples ignorance.
---
Shaman was released for Alliance in 2.0.X - you sure you’re not thinking about it proccing off both Stormstrike and the auto? That’s still 6 autos. 
---
\* Blush: Murky, Lurky, Gurky, Squirky, Pepe and Pepe the Pirate

Pls give me the Classic and Wrath of the Lich King Collectors Editon :D
---
Classic World of Warcraft! 
---
This. You also have to deal with the attunment, which I know how to bug ofc, but still it compounds the problem with UBRS PuGs
---
The only issue is that you wanna make sure there is enough demand for it so you don't end up with a dead server that is hard to merge. 
---
No vanilla. Zzzzzzzz
---
We’ll see.  So far they’ve announced changes from their initial plans for content rollout, itemization, and loot sharing.  I doubt those will be the last tweaks they make. 
---
We will build a wall but with a drive through window for visas BRILLIANT! 
---
&gt;Nobody can complain here
---
Are you new?
---
But its not something that really needs to be fixed though. You might not have got it but oh well? Someone in the raid did, Your team is stronger now. Unless you have a master looter with downs syndrome and gave it to entirely the wrong class or something in that case why is he even your loot master? In my 14 odd years playing giving loot to the wrong player is the only thing iv never done or actually seen (at least by accident. Had plenty of "Whoops I misscliked that loot to my friend whomp whomp" and you leave those raids the second it happens.  
---
Don't you have an ice wall to worry about keeping in the world's water?
---
I was planning to play on RP-PvP, so I really hope there's at least one.
---
This is fantastic news. Only thing though, what about UBRS? Sure it's a dungeon, but you do use a raid group for it, plus they specifically said "fire person content"
---
PvP Hit cap for spells is 6% I believe. Shaman's receive 3% from talents so they should get another 3% from gear which isn't too hard.
---
[http://classicdb.ch/?item=9608](http://classicdb.ch/?item=9608) Real MVP from Gnomer quests.
---
This a shill account?
---
This would ruin looking for the rare w/ the SP trinket, [https://classicdb.ch/?item=12930](https://classicdb.ch/?item=12930). I think its BiS for many classes and specs until BWL or ZG comes out.
---
Makes sense.  Still some loopholes but really shouldn’t be an issue imo. I think blizz made a good call with this one, a great compromise for sure.
---
In my opinion, not really. Different projects. Classic WoW is a thing in the first place, because the community demanded the game and Blizzard listened. Otherwise they would've left us with Pristine servers. So far, they have shown signs of listening to the community in about every blue post stating changes and/or talking about Classic. If that isn't a clear showcase of Blizzard listening, then I don't know what is.
---
I think this comment is written out of fear instead of trusting in Classic to stand on its own merits. 
---
If BFA ruins classic for anyone then it wasn’t the right game for them to start with. 
---
I’d say to OP to go play BFA, it’s a lot of fun till you run out of things to do and by the time Classic may already be out. 
---
Yeah unfortunatly every system has its issues. Those 30% should all just join a mega guild, Call it PUG and have raids running throught the week. Slap 500 people in there and you have 12 chances to get into a "PUG" per week. 
---
Asking a company to release a product that their consumers can't access for 3+ hours at launch? That's completely unacceptable for them to do, and for us to ask them to do. They came up with a *temporary* solution that helps us and them. It's a *fair* solution.
---
And larger servers? That's not how vanilla was, and it would be detrimental to the in-game economy and the classic experience.
---
Sharding is a *fine* solution that alleviates everybody's problems, and it likely wont last past day 3 or so of launch. Remember the demo with the time limit on how long you could play? They removed it just a few hours into Blizzcon when it became apparent that it wouldn't be needed. Sharding will be the same.
---
If you want to play a MMORPG than wait for Classic.
---
If you want to play a singleplayer "Facebook Game" then play BFA.
---
They dont have the pre 1.12 data so they would have to build that from scratch. I loved the 2 day AVs but I'm also kind of ok with just 1.12 AV
---
Seems like we've had completely different experiences on that matter. I saw judgement paladins everywhere even in BfA. Besides, the t0.5 sets or looms nowadays are being mogged very heavily by players, such as myself (again, this is just how I've seen things go).
---
Spoken like a true goblin.
---
There's already a thread about Blizz's decision on loot trading. It's stickied. Surely, the more reasonable thing to do would be to link this in a comment on that page, rather than make its own post?     
---
      
---
Imagine if everyone just created a new thread to share their opinion on a piece of news that came out. Clutter central. 
---
Yea that’s can happen, but like what was already mentioned, most people get enchants on their new gear.  You would have to not enchant any of your gear to really pull this off properly.  And at the end of the day, this stuff will happen, but I don’t think it will be a huge issue. 
---
Nope, I’m pretty sure it was a bug when released. I think they patched it out pretty quickly, but it was definitely there. 
---
Except it's so fucking transparent he is just conforming it to whatever Blizzard says, I have a real chip on my shoulder for people who enter the Vanilla community and become blizz fanboys. 
---
When they had loot trading: This was a really smart move by Blizzard, everyone else is overreacting, you'll be really glad when this is a feature!
---
Blizzard changes it: This was a really smart move by Blizzard, because they are responding to the community outcry, I'm so glad they came to their senses about loot trading.
---
It's just a low-grade form of grifting, and subverts everything we stand for. 
---
Agreed. Word would get out pretty quick.
---
Jesus some of you are paranoid lol. It's just something they write in the end of some posts, stop analyzing and freaking out about stuff that doesn't make sense.
---
Except the loot option is clearly seen. People will drop ML 5 men runs the moment they join and see that big ass "Loot set to Master Looter".
---
Or will drop the group when the party leader changes the loot option before a boss.
---
And they will NEVER join a group with that guy again.
---
Oh, and ONE MORE THING : Master Looter WAS in Vanilla, and this type of ninja looting (changing loot option to Master Looter before bosses) was the least used...and when it was, was similar to label yourself as a ninja, and it will instantly be blacklisted.
---
God i hope they create new t2.5 at least so that it will look different on each class... instead of being reskins, i have had enough of T9 being done in the same concept in my time... bleh.
---
If you play a couple of hours in the weekend it will take you like 2 years to get to lvl 60 so I wouldn't worry too much about them yet. 
---
Oh, they definitely are. That on it's own doesn't mean much though. They need to continue showing that not only are they listening, but they are acting upon that knowledge.
---
And there's still the very real possibility that while some particular devs on this project are passionate about things, that doesnt mean the same for their managers and project leads, etc.
---
I have to disagree. His movement in this video is really way beyond the average hunter. I cant even remember another horde hunter who gave me any pause at the time. And back then I never thought Wesly was *that* good because I was always in better guilds and thus outgeared him, but looking back and comparing him to other hunters' PVP videos his skill really becomes apparent.  
---
As for his gear compared to others, he was even with both the 1v1's he fought. And the 1v2+'s he fought, he outgeared them but not by a huge amount (a couple pieces of t1 and a blue crossbow/arc reaper wasn't a crazy advantage like full t2 or t3).
---
I was kind of in favor of loot trading, tbh. Because there's no disenchant option in vanilla, it makes it somewhat of a pain to make sure that *no one* actually wants the item for any reason before you take it and shard it. Especially if multiple items are getting rolled on at the same time.
---
I’ve never played on a private server and in my region this term has been long known: so nothing new.
---
I think they were made that way to symbolize the hivemind of the old gods minions.
---
It's important to note that we don't really know exactly how glancing blow reduction works, so edgemaster's could be BIS for humans and orcs in addition.
---
Modern wow and classic are for all intents and purposes different games.
---
It would be like asking if you should play Skyrim before trying Morrowind. If you let Battle for Azeroth create expectations that you carry over into classic, you'll only set yourself up for disappointment. If you can recognize that the game has changed *so much* over the years that vanilla WoW and modern WoW are completely different in nearly every aspect, then I don't see a problem.
---
If you're itching to get into WoW now, go ahead. Just don't go into Classic this summer expecting it to be anything like BFA. Classic is a much slower-paced, more grindy, very different kind of game.
---
I do hope that Classic WoW overtakes Retail WoW. That would be a dream come true.
---
Yeah, back then most people had no idea what they were doing so players like him stood out.
---
GIVE US A RELEASE DATE! 
---
Yeah but in a community where word gets around their name would get sullied really quick. Like another poster said here, a quick post on the forums with video evidence would make sure that behavior like this stopped real quick. It's too risky.
---
yes, but only if done right. I don't want some retail inspired content in vanilla.
---
And they will be ignored by Blizzard.
---
Is it though? That's like saying D&amp;D is *less* of a "real RPG" than this? Something that makes a character *unique* is the fact that they have specific traits. You know every Orc is Hardy, every Human perceptive, every Night Elf stealthy. Taurens will clap you if you stand too close, and Trolls will burst you when you're low.
---
I'm not against this idea, it's pretty cool for a custom server, but I don't think this is anyway makes it more *flavorful* for RPG aspects. 
---
Don’t give a shit about BFA, personally.
---
Just wait, retail WoW is nothing like classic.
---
I don’t understand. Why is it offensive?
---
For me it sounds cute and disgusting at the same time, like “bro”
---
Though I welcome bromance as I’m gay myself
---
The latter ladder ofc.
---
&gt; The problem is that the retail community is asking for the WRONG THINGS.
---
This has happened ever since pre-TBC. Classic is different because we're not asking for expansion/new stuff or fixes for the live. This is a snapshot, far easier to implement because we know the end goal
---
Rofl... I called it almost exactly.
---
https://youtu.be/3VzYkpAxwFY?t=31
---
anyway, very very likely there will be more cases of people abusing the system than people benefit from it because of real wrongly distributed loot by accident. even I would strongly consider buying bop stuff from another guildmate/player who rolled for the same item. seems super convenient to think like that.
---
Troll master race.
---
I played Horde on Defias Brotherhood and I think the OP is pretty accurate, there was the occasional person making a solid effort to roleplay, and maybe some guilds/group-events, but not more than 10% of the playerbase. Still mostly tourists who liked the idea but didn't put in much effort (me included), or people who just read EZ-PvP 
---
I do think the community was a bit more mature on RP(-PvP) realms, if only because most people at least take the effort to come up with a better name than pussydestroyer5000. So yeah, nice community but not some RP-heaven from my perspective.
---
That’s fantastic! My view on mishandled loot in dungeons is simple: try again! They literally took the words right out of my mind for that one.
---
THEY'RE ACTUALLY LISTENING
---
the classic team seems really passionate about this project!
---
&gt; The majority is not always right... see retail WoW. 
---
Except that the majority IS RIGHT in Retail. Or you think that what led to the pile of shit called BfA was NOT what the majority wanted?
---
Oh, they WANTED it. And they LIKE IT ! Look at GD forums. The MAJORITY is happy with BfA.
---
They are STILL PLAYING, right?
---
I think they just lacked time/resources as it was with T9. It was just an emergency stop-gap. I mean C'thun looks AWESOME! But sets look meh, compare them to any other vanilla tiers... and 2.5 is just underwhelming. 
---
Look at DK's T15 - it's fabulous and so twisted and OG's themed. Then there is Locks Sha-Skin Regalia (T14), also cool, and again Locks T13 is all facelessy and stuff. Shame there was nothing like that in Ulduar, but i can understand, because tis was more about Titans and their tech than Old Gods.
---
Odd choice though. Making it based on whether or not there is a raid lockout, rather than whether or not it was in a raid group means you can't loot trade Ubrs loot, but also can't loot trade the loot from green dragons/kazzak/azuregos.
---
I think making the determining factor being group type, rather than raid lockout, would have been far more consistent.
---
Viable as in functional? sure.
---
Viable as in having enough advantages to justify benching a pure DPS class/fury? well, that would be up to the raidleader, and most would say no.
---
Regardless, BIS lists exists even for the meme-specs.
---
When you say you would recommend priest if you wanted to play this way, wouldn't raiding as a priest healer not really gear you for offensive pvp at all? There's not really any overlap in the gear.
---
Even if the latter ladder is the badder ladder?
---
Changes are happening. You can't #nochanges in regards to larger servers. Larger servers would alleviate the 3 hour login issues. Detrimental to the economy how? If anything a new supply of buyers and sellers would make the economy stronger.
---
And once again, allowing the sharding would force us to trust Blizzard not to abuse it in the future. Blizzard hasn't had that kind of trust in a long time and doesn't have the track record to gain that trust back anytime soon. Because it would be very easy for them to go "oh Barrens is a little crowded let's extend sharding there." Then "oh STV doesnt fit in with the leveling experience, it suddenly gets hard to quest, let's use sharing" to "oh, well, 90% of the zones have sharding at this point and Silithus is going to be crowded anyways come AQ, so let's just put sharding everywhere".
---
Whereas if they never had it to begin with, it would be a LOT harder to justify putting it in after the fact.
---
How can be smth noch 100% Blizzlike if you copy the code for 1.12.1 into a latest infrastructure and make it work. Do you even have any ideas about Coding/scripting and compileing? And what it means what a Code says and what smth should do? The Onlything which will be not "Blizzlike" is the Patching.
---
In other words "Based on the communication and how they're changing things based on community feedback the game looks to be good, but I'll just continue to judge the CLASSIC project, based on Blizzard's other projects and titles" - You're exactly the type of person I meant in my initial comment. I'm done.
---
Yes but we are literally wearing armor made from pieces of the bugs in aq. They had also just put the actual textures on t2 sets.
---
I agree that sharding just doesn't "fit" in vanilla/classic. I don't feel like it's the most appropriate way to handle launch week, let alone any population issues after that.
---
That said, I played on one of those 10k pop private servers and I disagree regarding it being "fun". It didn't feel like "vanilla". It's an enormously huge change to authenticity in my opinion. Vanilla server caps were much smaller than that, estimated to be no higher than 5k but probably closer to 3k.
---
I do think dynamic respawns are a better way to handle crowding instead of resorting to sharding, but in my opinion it's still imperative that server population caps remain vanilla-esque to maintain an authentic leveling experience.
---
What evidence do we have to the contrary of /sit critical proc? All I have heard was it not being in the demo.
---
its about the communication... thats IT! Classic players ask for smth and let Bliuuard know and they respawn to it. That is the BIG difference with BFA
---
at this pace they will probably (and hopefully) abandon sharding, too! 
---
They listen. This is great. big plus to blizz.
---
That’s awesome!
---
Well that's something that A) they announced only 10 days ago, and B) they don't actually have the data for as they said at Blizzcon.
---
So it's not really a matter of waiting and seeing unless they since Blizzcon managed to find an earlier backup, which there is no reason to believe.
---
Yeah, it'll change things a bit if stuff like Savage Gladiator Chain is insane from the get-go. Not necessarily in a bad way, just dreading the thought of doing arena runs again lol.
---
To be fair. All the Activision-Blizzard apologists deserve all the flak they get. Imagine if we didnt complain about loot trading (*because its rude, and we should be happy to even get classic* - as the apologists put it) we would still be going into classic with loot trading intact.
---
So for those of us who can't access the Blizzard forums, is there a nice copy-paste version somebody can provide?
---
I meant historically, people will have used the models from heirlooms more than judgment because heirlooms predate transmog and low level characters had fewer transmog options once transmog was introduced. Now that we have account-wide transmog, we don't see them as often. 
---
I just haven't had the experience you've had with Judgment for a long time. I main paladin so I spent a tremendous amount of time around paladins from both factions throughout Legion. Like I said, I do think it's probably still one of the most popular sets. But maybe only by 5-10% as opposed to the 30%+ it might've been in the early days of transmog. 
---
They're shattering every single reasonae expectation that's been placed on them. I'm very happy with where Classic is going!
---
We aren't judging the product. We are judging the people behind the product. That's what's key here.
---
It's like the opposite of the Fallout 76 fiasco. Where everyone was like "oh its Bethesda, they're great, the game is going to be great" and it turned out like dogshit. That was a case of putting too much faith in the history of the company. Now, Blizzard is contending with the opposite, where rather than there being too much faith, there's no faith. They have to build it back up again over time, and that will take a long time and many posts.
---
Sure, but you're a minority. Blizz allowed inactive accounts to post on the classic sections of the official forums, btw, so plenty of people are hanging out there.
---
Just to play devil's advocate here, wouldn't the same thing also happen with loot sharing collusion if it was obvious that person did not need the item? 
---
Either way, the majority of the runs will consist of reserve runs if private server culture is any indication. 
---
I havent raided except for LFR in the last couple of xpacs and let me tell you...
---
...
---
I agree. The content is there to be a challenge of some kind (inb4 "modern raids are harder"), you shouldnt get it just becausw.
---
Good point. Discussion forums like this and youtube etc should only have the publishers and such share their stuff.
---
Its a public discussion forum.. this is exactly whats its for. Sharing and discussing opinions, wether its through comment or video or whatever. 
---
You mention getting to meeting stones. From memory meeting stones in vanilla were just used to queue up for a group finder for that specific dungeon. As they were outside the dungeons they were barely used. They only could be used to summon someone in Burning Crusade
---
Since there were 4 consecutive blue posts and this is the last one than that must mean it’s 4 months away. 
---
July it is.
---
&gt; "tough luck" which is fine to me.
---
For the first time in WoW's history there will be no solution to loot mistakes. Blizz has always had the helpful approach but because children cried we now just get "tough luck". so good. 
---
Dynamic respawns can be done 100 different ways. As long as you don't be retarded and set it to permanent 1000% increased respawn rate (which absolutely no one is asking for) then no, grinding would still be no way near as efficient as questing.  
---
We already have sharding, so Blizzard has already acknowledged they don't want Classic lvl 1-30 to be a masochism challenge where people are unable to play the game with 1,500 people in a single zone. Now that we know that a quest centric gameplay experience is important to Blizzard, our choices are either sharding people so that no more than 5 people are doing a quest at once with zone caps of ~50 (vanilla-like respawns), or put faster respawns in but let 15+ people in a questing area at once with zone caps of ~200.  
---
Personally I'm ok with the beginner zones being overcrowded and feeling very busy during launch, so dynamic respawns are the only way to get that, without losing 95% of the casual population. You might laugh that casuals aren't nOcHaNgEs #hardcore enough to sit around for 4 mins to try and tag a mob, but remember that Blizzard very deliberately has made Classic free to anyone with a WoW sub and $0 buy-in cost, so this audience is core to the Classic business model. In addition the worse the dropout rate is of these people the more dead servers and merges we will have down the line which is a bad situation for everyone.
---
This reminds me of the old world of warcraft website where you could view the sets like this &lt;3
---
Are you sure that's correct? I've seen a fair number of sources saying it was added much earlier in the game, and that it's stats were changed from +DEF/+Crit to being the STR/AGI/STA/+crit chest we know.
---
I was trying to upload an image but Imgur wasn't working properly, but basically it says that in patch 1.7 the amount of defence in it was lowered by 7 points, and that in patch 1.10 it was updated to be a DPS chest.
---
Also looking on classic wowhead there are a few comments there prior to patch 1.11 regarding the chest, but wowhead itself says it was added in 1.11 :/
---
From what I understand though (assuming that it was in the game prior to the 1.11 patch) that on classic it will retain its great stats since it was added prior to 1.10, making it the best dps chest in the game for warriors and I'm assuming a lot of other classes.
---
Anyway, if someone knows when this chest was actually in the game that'd be great info, haha.
---
Oh, wow. Thanks for the great explanation!
---
I think this would drive new players away from playing on a server where they are going to be a 1/3 underdog where you can go to a server and be 3/1 in favor.
---
I always wondered what Timbermaw hold in Ashzara would have been like, there was also a place in southern Tanaris with elite stone dudes that would have been a cool raid.
---
Mr 'fand, how do you feel about 1.12 itemization on launch, in regards to stuff like Savage Gladiator Chain being the nutty dps version at the start of the game? My fears were largely assuaged by their announcement about 1.10 item additions and specifically their namedrop of Titanic Leggings, but I'm sort of weirded out by the thought of launching with 1.12 balance for all the items that are already in the game.
---
I'm not sure if there are any examples that will drastically change too much besides missing out on stuff like Spirit of Aquementas. This isn't meant as a complaint towards the dev team at all btw as I'm pretty much blown away by how well they're handling everything. 
---
A logical response. 
---
&gt; They are STILL PLAYING, right?
---
If you only count the people still playing then yes... the majority of people are still playing... what kind of stupid argument is that?
---
Oh for sure. It just cuts down on the frequency imo. It's probably stealthier without this compromise. But for sure, word would still get around. This way you need the party leader to be the jerk, the old  way anybody could do this.
---
its 4% and you can only get 99% hit so 3%. im willing to bet my first gold on it
---
The same issue technically will exist for raid pugs, with small pockets of say, 2-5 players working together to do that same thing, but the difference is in a raid with 40 people, even if only 10 of those 40 are rolling on any one piece, its 5-8 vs 2-5, so the group trying this aren't stacking the odds anywhere near as heavily in their favor
---
All this means is that the gear you were concerned about having stolen via loot trading got upgraded from blues and greens to purples.
---
While it is true that many of you will be raiding in a real guild with a real loot system; it is also true that many other players will not (I plan to be among them); and any raid that is being pugged will still be vulnerable to loot manipulation.
---
Most notably of those are ZG runs for Raptor / Tiger mounts, which is something that I can say with confidence will be pugged every week for the entire duration of classic.
---
I think his point is priest has a lot of powerful utility spells like fear, manaburn, mindcontrol and dispel that make it a much more useful class when you're undergeared and can't put out burst damage.
---
I agree. Overall it's a good change. Jerks are gonna be jerks though. 
---
Only thing I'm championing is releasing the damn game. Right click reporting, loot trading, sharding, what version of AV to use, all that garbage can be sorted out after launch. Just make the game playable and let me fucking play.
---
You could...except that there might be ANOTHER hunter that is going to be taken instead you or your friend. Why? because PuG raids are not LFR.
---
The raid leader will have PLENTY of players to choose from. Usually, there are going to be like 80 people willing to join Legolas (the trustworthy PuG leader) MC raid.
---
But Legolas wants a SMOOTH and nice run, so he will still be known as legolas, the trustworthy PuG leader.. He WILL CHERRY PICK players. And gear will COUNT a lot...because Legolas wants players in his PuG to have ONE item gained after each raid.
---
He will NOT take 2 hunters in greens, that need like 10 upgrades, instead 2 fairly good geared Hunters that need 1 or 2 items.
---
First, those 2 geared Hunters will do MUCH MORE DAMAGE (faster run) and secondly, they will roll on 1 item only, not 10.
---
It's a matter of organizing PuGs...so while theoretically you and your friend CAN join and use crap gear...most likely you will NOT be picked for the run.
---
I played on Maelstrom from when it started til about 2 weeks after BC came out.  Guild fell apart quickly after BC because of raid size changes.  I really enjoyed my time on RP-PvP though.
---
So great :) brought back alot of memories. Thanks for doing this :)
---
I mean, loot sharing has been a concern for months, and we only got a solution to it now. Retail is a constantly evolving game, and they have to be a lot more careful about what feedback they're listening to, and what they're gonna change about the game, so obviously the communication is not going to be fast - but there are still monthly(?) Q&amp;A's where they address these concerns, even if they give non-definitve answers a lot of the time, it's clear they're listening.
---
Insane leveling speed due to super fast respawns? Sign me up!
---
You make a few good points. Speaking to the whole "patch x vs patch y", thats where i underline the question: "What is the fucking point (not rhetorical)?" If patch X releases a feature that severely diminished community interaction or something, then throw it the fuck out. If it doesn't, however, lets look onward and see how it plays out (While letting blizz know what we think), lets stop looking at changes vs nochanges because this game isn't a static thing. It's an MMO, literally the most fluid changing type of game out there.
---
Lets instead pay attention to "how does feature Q affect the game?" like we just did with loot trading. That was a change, and i'm glad to see the conversation wasn't about 'HEY THAT WASNT A THING IN VANLIAA WOW RHEEEEEEEEEE" but instead we looked at the point of it, how it addressed said point, got the picture, and carried on.
---
Plus (Total side point), would you really want to be a developer who's job is to..... identically re-create something? Would you want to go work for Disney, as an animator, and literally re-draw/color/animate 1990s Disney movies all day, never doing any original work? The people who make this project aren't going to give a fuck if they're soul purpose is to be chained to Vanilla in its exact form/shape. 
---
That isn't good for the game. You don't get games like WOW when everyone's just..... recreating someone elses work. PLUS theres the question of what happens after Naxx. 
---
So, crazy enough..... Blizzard is going to have to make SOME decisions.
---
Thank you for not screeching at me.
---
Blizzard turned thier back on gamers like you and me for over a decade. Earned my distrust in thier products. 
---
Now there is a movement within gaming to return to old-school games and i hope Blizzard is making Classic to those players. Blizz will need our help because they forgot how to do it. 
---
Choping Vanilla timeline up into 4 parts, that is trivial for any Vanilla player to identify as a mistake. With our feedback they decided 6 patches is better. So we are helping, even the chaotic and autistic screething is helping. 
---
That being said, the Classic developers are looking better and better with every blue post. So i am not as jaded as i once was. Im still not letting them drive though. If they are screwing up Classic i will tell them. 
---
Yeah they definitely do. That'd just be playing a healer though. He was wanting to play a dps spec in pvp and heal in pve.
---
This is a strange thing to debate so vigorously. Like I said, if it’s the 1.12 version it’ll be as the poster said. But the 1.12 version is way out of line with other wands of the same required level. If someone at Blizzard recognizes that, it might lead to a change. If it stays as 1.12 then it’s an OP item, I think we can agree there. 
---
I can now say that I trust this dev team. Great job and keep listening to us as you have been.
---
I always got a greater magic wand from a enchanter.  But I usually carried two Wands as a priest as resistance could be a problem on certain mobs.  
---
(Priest wands a lot). 
---
You won't be able to face tank like a pally could but don't underestimate the strength of imp inner fire. Ideally your warrior is also peeling for you and you've got bubble. One big advantage you would have as a priest over pally is mana burn. Horde priests eat pally using mana burn, as a priest yourself you're still susceptible to getting mana burned but at least you can use it as well.
---
Horde warr/priest vs ally warr/pally would usually result in a loss for the ally guys. 
---
With Master loot the leader can do whatever they want with the loot. And certainly "collude" with their friends in PUG groups the same way people are saying will happen with loot trading
---
Exactly. Hundreds of people trying to loot the same item is no fun. I don't mind sharding (for the first few weeks) in the 1-10 zones at all.
---
Damn only 3 shaman out of 40 people.
---
Im pretty sure the crafted greater magic wand is stronger with a lower level requirement. 
---
I'm not sure what you are considering a "vigorous debate" here. I'm just telling you how it is. Do not mix fact with opinion.
---
P sure this is correct
---
that is very very good. they are listening. they are making good decisions. i am starting to feel really comfortable about that they doong it right! &lt;3 
---
Edit: Wow only 3 mages too.  That is crazy.
---
What?
---
No, the patch was an ICD for WF, not the proc on procs which had been patched much earlier. When the pre patch released, and what I thought was like first day or week of TBC, they gave WF an ICD and DW WF was eliminated as an option due to the numbers it could put out. This was really a big nerf to WF because previously you could proc it back to back on a one handed weapon.
---
I'm honestly a little uninformed on the issue so if someone could explain that would help me out: Is accidentally giving raid loot to the wrong person a serious issue? Having not raided much I assume it would be a rare occurrence - is it an issue when there is a master looter that mis-clicks, or when everyone is allowed to roll and a warrior accidentally clicks need on a mage set? 
---
I would think that if there is any need to have a more fair system, it should be directed at PUG dungeons, where you are frequently getting paired with strangers who may choose to steal gear. Wouldn't raids, which tend to consist of a single guild, have a higher value of trust and less ninja'ing? Also, is this a totally separate topic from the loot rules where you can only roll need for a type of armor that you can use?
---
Any chance for a link on the mage list? Thanks!
---
Do you have a discord channel?
---
Highlighting the dev Q&amp;A part 192 relevant to this thread for anyone who might have missed it:
---
Please keep providing feedback, we know some of you want RP-PvP, and even if that doesn’t happen at launch, there’s always a chance to expand our realm structure if there’s enough demand for it, so definitely keep making yourselves heard by sharing your feedback and we’ll make sure to relay it to the dev team.
---
I can only comment on my experiences in vanilla back in the day. 
---
Started out on stormrage - horde, it was 80-20 alliance, got farmed constantly by alliance premades.
---
Moved to malfurion - horde, it was 60-40 alliance, got farmed constantly by premades.
---
After cross realm bgs, the premades stopped for the most part.
---
Therefore I am 100%  cross realm bgs. It was part of 1.12, therefore it should be part of classic.
---
Most (early) fury talents rely on you being crit, not you critting, and you dont get many arms talents that make a hell of a difference until 30+ (except overpower I guess), while fury you get benefits all the way, also until you get whirlwind you shouldn't need to care much about the speed of your 2 hander and after 30 you have whirlwind axe and you can respec arms if you want
---
succubus can seduce, if you put points into demo and take fel dom you can basically instant summon it should a pull go bad or adds come in. I've def seen locks save a wipe by seducing a caster add and fearing something else (although fear is always iffy). The imp's stam buff is always helpful, and as you mentioned healthstones and soulstones.
---
Is there an actual reason for the 10:00 mark in terms or YT monitization or something? Or is it just a meme that people ramble on for too long about nothing?
---
 There! Ya big babies. Got what you want. I hope to god I never have to hear you mewl about this ever again. 
---
When was UBRS 40?
---
Soon^^TM
---
I am just "memeing" him, but the reasoning is at the 10 minute mark, you can fit to ads into the video, instead of just one.
---
Earth shield is Wotlk
---
5 locks
---
7 priests
---
5 druids :O
---
only 3 shamans
---
4 mages
---
6 hunters
---
4 rogues
---
6 warrs
---
Honestly I personally I just don’t want permanent sharding, just enough to get out of the starting area. The starting areas are just so dense that we would literally spend multiple hours there.
---
Still one the earliest rings you can get!
---
This is the best Druid list out there. 
---
I think it's a really good question, there are some items like that that are already in the game that get big buffs later on for example Savage Gladiator Chain like you said. I'm under the impression that items like this are going to get updated later on when they add the new gear in, because otherwise Savage Gladiator Chain is one of the best physical DPS chestpieces until AQ40.
---
Fair enough. It also could be the case that Judgement stands out and I pay attention to it more than other sets. Personally, I think it is very lame to transmog a full set (regardless of how good it looks) but I understand why people do so.
---
**Catform Quest**
---
I didn't create this. Ah I just realized the Ytber and I have the same name.
---
Yeah want to clarify for everyone I'm not the ytber, all credit to him. 
---
Strange how both of their videos about this subject are 8 minutes
---
am i supposed to have one?
---
I disagree. For some people, sure, and they usually flock to those specific servers. Most other people want consistent pvp on pvp servers and not hour long BG queues, so joining a server to balance it out is in their own interest
---
Are you taking into account that in the normal spec you will have to stop dpsing because of higher threat, where as in SL you may be able to dps full time...or is your spreadsheet calculating both specs dpsing full time?
---
Very good guide. However, IRC’s blood fury racial is not 25% increased damage, it’s 25% increase to base melee attack power, and zero use to a warlock. Orc probably still are the better race, but not due to blood fury 
---
What were you hoping to see come down the pipe? It didn't look like there was much support for 'loot trading in every dungeon/raid'.
---
blizzard doesnt really have a GM team any more, at least not one that even remotely resembles what you may remember
---
While I didn't feel strongly one way or the other, the fact they listen and try to find a middle ground does make me optimistic about the project as a whole. 
---
I actually hated Storm Peaks and Icecrown because of this. I like exploring and being a part of my surroundings. I have very little memory of those zones because you really just flied to your objectives and got outta there.
---
Exactly this
---
&gt; and only 3 mages.
---
4
---
This list has mistakes. But damn it's a great guideline for many classes. And it's far more correct than it is incorrect
---
&gt; What was there before today
---
Certainly didn't want to see the first time in wow's history where blizz has said "tough luck fuck off" to loot mistakes.
---
Awesome dude. 
---
Heyy was this on Project Azeroth a year ago? A lot of familiar names. Or is there another server with the same people?
---
Seek help. 
---
Used to play on Defias from vanilla till WotLK. Loved that server!
---
Today I really tought youtube reduced the quota to 8 minutes, because both his and tip outs' videos are on the 8 minute mark.
---
Fantastic news! I'm so glad they are listening.
---
Grats to my guild mate, but I can't believe this shit. 
---
I'll post what I said in the mega thread. I didn't feel strongly one way or the other but the fact that they're trying to find the middle ground is enough to make me really optimistic of this project as a whole. Please keep up the good work and please keep listening and communicating with us Blizz. 
---
K.

---
I love skinning.
---
You get to loot beasts twice.
---
Then the BFD wand
---
That would be Titan panel.
---
&gt;So let's chill the fuck out and let Blizzard take control of the wheel.
---
This line stuck out the most to me, This is literally the oppisite of what we should do. Look what happened when we did let Blizzard take the wheel we now have BFA... Christ imagine if it was classic wow in name but it was just a BFA server with a level 60 cap. You know Blizzard would try and pull some shit like that. 
---
Asking for things to be in a certain state back when people actually enjoyed playing the game is fine, Its the whole reason we asked for classic.
---
Open World - rogues. Being able to catch everyone unprepared means you never have to take a fight you’re not confident that you can’t win. Druids to a lesser degree - plus they’re notoriously slippery. 
---
Soul Link warlocks and shadow priests are also both stupidly tanky and pump out great damage. Neither of these are particularly affectef by LOS.
---
Group PvP is rare in the world. Healers start getting strong in group PvP, especially priests, paladins and shaman because magi and warriors are the unqestionable kings of group PvP. Polymorph is *by far* the strongest spell in the game, and a well supported warrior can tear through an entire group in seconds. 
---
In WSG, druids are king. Absolutely unparalleled flag carriers. Stupidly high stamina, instant heals (you usually run resto), basically immunity to slows and polymorphs, a self-peel in Nature’s Grasp and the highest base-movement speed in the game through the PvP set bonus. 
---
Battlegrounds in general is also where the balance of power in ranged classes shifts from shadow priests and warlocks (due to hunters shifting the outlasting meta with the massively powerful Viper Sting - a popular strategy in more coordinated premades is to leave the enemy healers alive, constantly drained to helplessness by hunters - though this is more prominent in AB than in WSG) - to the burstier SM/Ruin Warlocks, magi, and of course hunters. 
---
Again, warriors are fantastic if supported well. This goes for all group PvP. 
---
In AB, the meta revolves around powerful pushes with well-supported warriors, draining and skirmishing by hunters, and capping/scouting/defending by rogues and powerful control through magi and warlocks. This is also the BG where elemental/resto shamans are at their peak. Strong burst damage and strong support for warriors. 
---
I’m not sure if AV has a meta. Though I imagine that having a well geared tank is important. 
---
For duelling, most classes are pretty good. Despite our beliefs back then that melees scaled the best with gear, casters were definitely the big winners. Rogues and hunters fall off the higher gear levels go. Warriors are notoriously weak duellers. 
---
Casters, especially shadow priests and magi, are probably the strongest duellers overall. 
---
I’m sure I missed some of the nuances. Vanilla WoW is both highly skill dependant and extremely broadly nuanced.  The fact that the meta is still developing after 15 years can attest to this. 
---
When i found out Ghost wolf shamans can harvest herbs.. so damn good
---
Yeah but who's to say a night elf couldn't train with a Human to become more perceptive, or vice versa? There's no limits to an RPG and you could think of it in many ways. I never said D&amp;D was less of an RPG, there's ways of going more in depth which is always interesting and is what gives this genre flavour. Maybe give divinity 2 original sin a look. You're not bound to certain traits because of who you choose to be. It's arguable one of the best RPGs today.
---
Level 18 alliance be like
---
The ICD was in TBC the patch for WF before that was to only allow procs on white hits, which meant it could proc back to back with a one handed in &lt; 3 seconds.
---
Improved thunder clap spam ez

Haha never take “no” for an answer.

Compromises are for sissies

&gt; I would think that if there is any need to have a more fair system, it should be directed at PUG dungeons, where you are frequently getting paired with strangers who may choose to steal gear.
---
thats 
---
literally
---
what
---
they
---
are
---
doing
---
Yes, and also, I'm fairly certain that in the beginning of BC (when they needed a new color because paladins and shamans appeared in the same raids) shamans used to be some kind of teal instead of dark blue.
---
How does "triangle trapping" work? I can't seem to find any information about the benefits of it and how exactly it's done. Thanks.
---
&gt;What were you hoping to see come down the pipe?
---
Just asking what you wanted to see happen.
---
&gt;Certainly didn't want to see the first time in wow's history where blizz has said "tough luck fuck off" to loot mistakes.
---
We haven't.
---
Quartz Cooldown?
---
If you want sharding to be removed, yes we need a valid alternative.
---
&gt;  raid pugs
---
dont pug raids then?
---
It existed but it was a defense piece. There's no official word on how these items will be handled, as in whether it will be in its pre or post-1.11 state on launch.
---
They should, The details are what really pull the whole thing togther. Its like not caring about getting stiching in your cloths becaue I mean its such a small part who cares if its thread or staples same thing right?
---
Math checks out.
---
They should just disable changing loot type mid combat.
---
Even the TL;DR needs a TL;DR
---
They do scale better than most classes with AQ and after gear, though, I hear. 
---
Hell yes!
---
I found this really good youtube video on duo leveling the other night, check it out. It goes over the pros/cons of the best combos.

There should be no less than one server type at launch. For all the things they have done for the community in order to make sure that things are going well and insure that it sticks together.  Outside of whatever happens after naxx be it new content or BC. There should be a server of every type
---
I see alot of data on the spreadheet, but don't see anything about total time dpsing.  Like in a 10 min fight, the DS/Ruin or SM/Ruin spec may only dps for 7 min total due to stopping dps to reduce threat...whereas since the SL spec does less dps to begin with, maybe the SL spec can dps the full 10min.  Would that 3min or dps difference even out the 2 specs in total dps over a period of time taking into account stopping for threat reduction...
---
&gt;The auto industry: We want our Model-T’s back (Vanilla)… Henry Ford’s stuff was so awesome (blah, blah)…We could support maybe the Mustang (BC), but no further (blah, blah)… Datsun’s 280Z (WotLK) is where it all went wrong (blah, blah)…Chrysler Minivans (Cata) are just too bad to deal with (blah, blah)…
---
This is always such an odd argument to see included. There's a huge market for older **CLASSIC** cars.
---
There will always be a market for "things like they used to be". Filling this market need is a good business decision for Blizzard. 
---
I'm pretty sure it doesn't. But I can only say for sure from private severs and can't remember trying this or not in vanilla. 
---
why do some dps items have yellow names?
---
Uh.. I don't think I'm "freaking out". I'm making an observation. As I said, it's not a big deal either way. It doesn't change the release date or anything.
---
To be clear "some posts" would presently be 100% of posts that are not followed by monthes of time before the next post.
---
No where did I declare it will be that long before the next post. I'm just pointing out an correlation and related omission. I thought it was interesting.
---
The sheet is linked up and shows threat calculations aswell. If however you go with imp for threat reduction and do not sacc your succ you are looking at a 25 to 30% dps loss.
---
Does this mean will see bread lines in WoW Classic?
---
what an epic reply!!! 
---
You and your team are knocking it out of the fucking park. Well done keep it up!
---
In short you are going to need to work harder and do more things - and your group is totally capable of ruining all of your hard work, even if you do everything correctly. As opposed to modern WoW where a tank can kind of solo carry, in Vanilla the group doing well as whole matters much more.
---
Every single pull are going to need to mark targets, set kill order, call for CC (SUPER important, and you should build your dungeon comp around CC if possible), work hard for threat, work super hard for AoE threat, LoS pull when possible - all things that can be completely ruined by having a DPS or even healer be out of place, start too early, hit the wrong target, and so on - all which will likely result in someone dying.
---
Make a friends list of competent DPS, and keep them as regulars. Gone are the days where a good tank, and maybe a good healer is all you needed, and 3 monkeys mashing dps buttons will do just fine.
---
Specwise I've heard you can get away as Arms / Fury for all 5 mans, and really the most important parts of prot are only 12 points deep (Last stand and Imp shield block) meaning you could hit 40 for MS / BT, then by 52 have all the most important tank talents too.
---
Gearwise - I remember when doing UBRS group leader would be checking gear and ensuring proper tank stuff with enough +def cap. So I'm guessing everything Pre-55 should be ok to wing mostly, but the closer you get to 60, even if 5 mans you should really be trying to have proper tank gear beyond just a shield.
---
i can see why people are concerned about it being in at the beginning because it will completely ruin the classic experience if its still there at end game, but i agree it's completely unplayable at low levels. however from private server experience, on fresh servers, there is always the 'zerg' of players that are constantly fighting for zones as they all level up at similar times, which is normally when the lower zones quieten down and also the zones ahead of the zerg of players. just hope sharding is only in the game for the lower level zones
---
I don't like that idea at all.. racials made picking your race important. If you can have anything expect to see a lot of humans and orcs.
---
I'm of the opinion that alternate progression (AP) could work, but cloning characters from Classic to AP servers would have to be a thing. That way you wouldn't lose your ability to play on Classic with your Classic character, and people playing on the Classic servers wouldn't *have* to deal with AP content.
---
This would also apply to implementing BC, I suppose. Not everyone would want to play BC, but people that do would likely not want to have to a) start over completely on a new server or b) give up all of their progress on their Classic server by leveling out of the vanilla content.
---
But it was a beautiful flight!
---
No|Yes

---
Right click reporting for spam|Right click ignore for *any reason you want*
---
&gt; Detrimental to the economy how? If anything a new supply of buyers and sellers would make the economy stronger.
---
It would be hell for leveling for starters. Forget the chaos of starting zones and spread that chaos over the entire game. Resources would be even more rare, and demand would massively outweigh the supply. Prices would inflate. 
---
Then the sense of community would die. It would be like going from small town USA where everyone knows their neighbors to NYC where no one even makes eye contact with their neighbors. 
---
The server populations were limited back in the day because of hardware, but then the game was *designed* around those limitations. The game isn't *designed* for 10k people online at once. It just wont work and it's a terrible solution.
---
They've explicitly said they *know* how detrimental sharding is to the Classic experience. If that's not good enough I don't know what to tell you.
---
Awesome. I accidentally gave Band of Accuria to the wrong player once and the drama that followed... of course the GMs wouldn't help so I think this is great. 
---
It was rammed but you are right it didnt take that long. I dont think OP played Nost launch or as you said he did not group up or is just a little touched in the head. I got to level 5 in one night whilst spending 90% of that night talking to people whilst sat in a big circle. Hell run to Shadowglen since 90% of night elfs play hunter and will have left the starting zone hours ago. 
---
saying calm down is why retail is in its current state. people are passionate man, it’s good to cause an uproar when things are uncertain, especially before release.
---
Good to know, ty
---
What's a UBRS and PUG raid? 
---
Maelstrom was pretty solid horde side through BC and Wrath. Though when RI kinda died out the server seemed to have gone down hill from there.
---
&gt;I like Paladins because of the way the Warcraft universe portrays them
---
Unfortunately pre-raid through AQ 40 BIS for holy is all cloth dresses and leather, so you never really get to look like that :(
---
Pre raid bis has 274 +healing in the main 8/8 armor slots. The same slots of full T1, T2, and 5/5 T2.5 + 3/8 T2 have like 150, 200, and 201 +healing respectively. That's pretty big.
---
plus stacking them would basically nullify the existence of soul bags completely, which might effect economy or something maybe.
---
Xperl
---
it depends
---
cloth heal gear on a pala for pvp? probably not
---
tier sets tho? yes
---
...I had my terrain distance all the way down. As far as I remember, those zones were mostly empty space. :P
---
honestly those Q&amp;A are the biggest joke . You want to have a good game? Make the game TBC 2.0 and why? Since the game was back then counted as a Hardcore game but the Sups went up to 10 Mio. before Wotlk arrived. which mean that the game which was not "casual" friendly was more popular then game which is casual friendly. But that is just my opinion
---
Patch 1.1 to 1.3.  All dungeons were 40 man up until the 1.3 patch.
---
I believe Xperl Unitframes allowed for this. A quick google of the addon shows similar 3-d moving portraits.

Can someone explain to me what this is about?  I have not played WOW for a long time and unsure what is being talked about here.
---
Can someone explain to me what this is, and what the alternatives were that people were worried about?
---
My understanding is that In MC locks will literally be spamming SB and that’s it until oom, is that accurate? If so, how much more involved are dungeons, since you Presumably can use your dots for thOse?
---
Shadow priests are just super strong as long as they have stats. Don't get me wrong proper dps gear will make you better for sure. That being said many of your most powerful abilities like Shield, and dispel magic don't really scale any way. They are a super strong class with only a little bit of gear.
---
&gt;unless it's mindblowingly fucking terrible which isn't the case.
---
But they are... Thats why we complain, Blizzard can then choose to take those complaints on or not. Thats down to them. So far they have been I mean look at what they did to loot trading, No system is perfect but now its only effecting a very small % of players being those who choose to only PUG raids.
---
Dwarf, easily. They look cooler in gear and stoneform breaks blind and clears warrior bleeding affects + increased armor.
---
I didn't invest heavy into Wow until TBC. When I did though, I picked a RP-PVP server. Ravenholdt. I loved it. It was the best of both worlds. And the pvp griefers didn't come in until late wrath. 
---
Some of my fondest wow memories are on that server. &lt;House Everdark&gt; for life!
---
Shame on you. 
---
I think it could be due to it being seen as more of a passion project by Blizzard rather than something they are trying to making a ton of revenue off of. 
---
 Yes, it is quite obvious that if one solution does not suit a number of people, then an alternative one is needed, thanks for pointing out the obvious. But I asked different, that solution should come from me or someone who also thinks that there should not be sharding in the game? 
---
No sitting back and letting blizzard drive the car is what got us here. Saying "yeah ok lets see what you have, Whats the worst that could happen" Rather than "This seems sketch, Can we get a justification on it or have it changed to XYZ instead?" Blizzard hit a person drove over the speed limit and now hit a tree with BFA. 
---
Wait until classic. 2 totally different games and I feel that you will enjoy feeling like you are entering on equal footing compared to hoping into BFA. While a good amount of us will be going into classic already experiencing a lot of the game play, we still have to level our characters and earn the gear that we are after. It will be much more enjoyable entering this journey at the same level versus jumping into a game where people have been playing their accounts for over 10 years.
---
ds-ruin is the best min-max spec (5% more shadow damage) but sm-ruin is a close second and you can have several in a raid
---
Who says it has to be 10k? Could be any number really.
---
You can't seriously be claiming that even on old retail servers of an estimated 2.5k the nodes were all so farmed that there was none extra to go around are you?
---
Private servers make community work with 10K servers, so it's not quite as big a difference as you claim. More like small village USA to small town USA.
---
They said they know how detrimental it is, yeah. Doesn't mean they won't do it anyways, whether because they think it makes the gameplay better (at the cost of the community) or whether they get ordered to do it by the higher ups in an effort to attract more casuals to Classic.
---
Blizzard does NOT have a good track record, so anything relying on blind faith on them is a bad idea.
---
How am I supposed to know what to think without one of these youtubers telling me?
---
If you're bringing nothing to the table, you're just complaining which solves nothing. You don't like the idea of *temporary* sharding, great, who cares?
---
lmao the warrior ran out of bandages
---
eh it doesnt seem efficient for them with pots and those
---
Also of course BFA is going to be googled more, people are checking DPS specs, BIS, Azerite changes and a billion other things BECAUSE THAT GAME IS OUT. hardly anyone should have a reason to google Classic WoW when were still 3+ months from release. 
---
I don’t see any mention of the fucking **GRAVESTONE SCEPTER AHHHHH SO MUCH FUCKING DEEPS REEE**
---
Earth shield is TBC. 
---
Thats good. Not what I was told though. Either way Enhance Shammy is trash. Don't get me wrong you can turbo gear and squash people but, so can everyone else. They just do it way better.
---
Spell hit cap is technically 3% - but you can’t negate the last 1%. You can easily hit cap with just Nature’s Guidance. 
---
Doh yeah riptide was wotlk wasnt  it
---
if there's a bunch of youtube videos of warlock pvp in the nude, then I'd say gear itsn't the biggest aspect of pvp for them.
---
The game is not just BFA but with a level 60 cap. 
---
"Why cant you be happy we have classic wow again oh stop moaning that everything is different."
---
I too played lightning hoof US. What guild were you in?
---
10k was just throwing a number out there.
---
&gt; You can't seriously be claiming that even on old retail servers of an estimated 2.5k the nodes were all so farmed that there was none extra to go around are you?
---
What? What are you trying to say here?
---
&gt; Private servers make community work with 10K servers, so it's not quite as big a difference as you claim. More like small village USA to small town USA.
---
I couldn't care less what private servers do. Private servers also turn all players in the start zones into physical fish occasionally. What's your point?
---
&gt; They said they know how detrimental it is, yeah. Doesn't mean they won't do it anyways
---
That's... literally what that means though... 
---
&gt; Blizzard does NOT have a good track record, so anything relying on blind faith on them is a bad idea.
---
Yes, they do, but feel free to keep wallowing in the band wagon. Despite what people's personal feelings about the expansions has been, it's only been this last year that they've actually messed up as a company. One bad year doesn't erase decades of good will. The Classic team clearly is trying to do their best, and it should be appreciated. Between the Classic panel at Blizzcon, and the communication we've had from them, they deserve a little faith to be given.
---
Gank or get ganked, that’s life
---
It does look a lot like x-Perl, but I believe a heavily customized version. 
---
[deleted]
---
That's what is planned ATM. Sharding for the low level zones, with zones in the 10-20 range like Westfall and Loch Modan possibly receiving sharding as well if the population explodes like it probably will. 
---
I agree!
---
One of the big issues with retail is how much fucking time you have to spend SOLO before you can enjoy group content.
---
Leveling? Solo. Every quest, even elites, can be taken on by one player.
---
Dungeons? LFD means you're "in a group", but nobody talks and they may as well be NPCs.
---
Raids? Better grind dailies *solo* for weeks to have appropriate gear.
---
In Vanilla, even on Pservers, I distinctly remember grouping up for *every* quest involving elites, and many quests that were just more difficult than I could handle on my own. You get to know people that level at the same pace as you because you just run into them over and over. Dungeons? You've gotta work together or you're gonna have a bad time. Communication was pretty important.
---
I wouldn't call warlocks High Damage while leveling. It's more slow and steady and limited downtime.
---
More Horde = more targets. Count me in for an Alliance pop disadvantage.
---
One of my rules, whenever I was leading a guild, was for rolls. If you rolled highest, you rock! Congrats.
---
But if you roll a 1? You win the item. Automatically.
---
It was HILARIOUS seeing people roll a 2. Or a 3. And say OMG SO CLOSE. But when someone dropped that utter shit roll and pulled off a 1, the entire raid went nuts.
---
Was great stuff. Naturally I never had a 100 vs 1 situation, but they would have re-rolled.
---
You can adjust the time frame in the sheet to your pleasing if you make a copy. For now its set at 2 mins or 120 sec. (Which is allready a long fight in classic sense)
---
Threat is long gone be an issue befor the 10 min mark if its an issue. What is the use of dps full duration and not being capped if it results in lower dps becaus SL it self does not lower the threat per damage.
---
DM does with imp out but then you are looking at a 25 to 30% dps loss vs ds ruin so you got to be threat capped by that mutch which is unlikly unless your tank is just autoattacking.
---
Not gonna calm down, no looting trading at all.
---
You think Blizzard will not change this aspect of the current itemization plan. I think it’s possible they will, although frankly if I were betting, I would bet they don’t change it. My point at the outset was simply that if the 1.12 version of this item isn’t in, it will change wand progression. 
---
Blizzard has more game designers employed now than ever...
---
Oof, can't even ask a legitimate question without getting /s reply
---
Hmm. I can absolutely be wrong on my memories as this was years ago. 
---
I was using a 2 handed weapon, around level 25, and attacked a priest a few levels higher than me in Stranglethorn. One swing and the priest died, I looked in the log and saw 6 windfury hits after my first attack. 
---
No hard evidence, and I can easy be misremembering with how fallible memory is.
---
Early warlocks with a wand and pet attack macro are playing a completely different game than warlocks without.
---
No trust me out of anyone that is currently working at Blizzard you want Ion to be doing it. The old team have moved on and changed massivly just look at Jeff Kaplan. 
---
exactly. this is why causing a ruckus and talking shit up is GOOD
---
blizz responds and considers the things we kick shit up about
---
now all we need is a definitive sharding response and we're basically set
---
Dude have a drink
---
Git gud or die trying
---
&gt; spell batching
---
What's this?
---
TBC truly was the beginning of the end. Resilience tore the game in 2 ruining any reason to raid other than to.....Idk feel good about beating robots in a easy game?
---

---
I'm doing the "welcome back" or whatever they're calling it this weekend, may hop on my old rogue just to see what's in the bank/bag.
---
Question, does anyone know if a Welcome Back person can play with someone doing the free, up to level 20 trial? I've downloaded the game for my wife who doesn't have an account and thought it'd be fun for us to just play around a bit in retail for a few days but want to make sure we can play together. 
---
Well, it's that thing, the main Vanilla purist argument: This change by itself won't necessarily be a problem, but it makes the "change" precedent, which means people will be aprehensive of future "harmless changes" to WoW Classic. There ya go, a pretty solid reason to complain.
---
What about a druid, paladin or even a shaman? They’re all better options than a pet. 
---
You can still 2h in BG's or whatever, but you can actually dps in raids. Also 2.03 was still vanilla. Besides, I actually enjoyed the pvp with 2 1h better, the bursts can be just as big, but they're more reliable. 2 1h is pretty much always better dps wise for classes that can.
---
Played from classic to cata!
---
This weekend retail is for free, so a friend of mine and i Took a look inside. Suddenly we had a 4 hour long blast by open world ganking and doing pvp! You‘ll gear up by just winning a match!
---
Defenitly try it out, when classic Hits, you‘ll Be able to play both. 
---
Each case is its own. If someone comes, crushes a lowbie and continues on their way, I see no harm in this. If they corpse camp you through your next 2 or 3 respawns, now it is gone beyond what I'd think appropriate.
---
Now watch out so I dont fall off this fence.
---
You think you do, but you don't 
---
Ya on the Alliance side we *started* to decline after Vanilla, but we were still pretty solid through TBC, and stayed afloat in WotLK. I wasn't around much in Cata, but by MoP it seemed to be a shell of it's former self. I miss RI keeping our server relevant in the global raiding community, even if I wasn't a raider myself :P
---
I'd say there is a difference between ganking and griefing. Killing some lowbies in a certain area adds to the excitement. It makes things harder for the lowbies for sure but there is always workarounds
---
Corpse camping the same player or keeping questgivers dead all the time is borderline harassment and actually prevents people progressing forcing them to eventually log off. That's not fun for anyone and should be against the rules.
---
I'm just still lost on the idea that people think the game will run smoothly with 300+ people in the same starting area. Mob spawns, quest progress, and general gameplay aside, I'm pretty sure the majority of people would just be chilling at 3FPS. Not everyone has a cutting edge machine to play on.
---
Nice cat ass
---
I imagine this comment will go on to be very popular.
---
u/kaivax please do this with sharding
---
this was such a great post, it put to bed a lot of worries we had.
---
the last thing people are terrified about is sharding killing immersion anywhere outside of starter zones. 
---
goldshire, razor hill, orgrimmar, stormwind, it would SUCK if these areas had people popping in/out visibly. total death of immersion.
---
private servers had huge populations and it was super fun to see bustling cities. PLEASE do sharding ONLY in 1-5 areas
---
Came here to post this, damn.
---
&gt; 25% increase to base melee attack power
---
Correct!
---
It can’t be used in combat.
---
How about adding that one battleground that was scrapped? I can’t think of the name at the moment. It was set in Azshara or had the same environment I believe. I believe it was supposed to be kind of like DotA in the way it played by taking down towers leading up to the enemies base. I can’t remember at the moment, someone remember hearing about this at one point? 
---
So, you claimed that a huge server would be a problem because supply for mats would be way too scarce compared to the demand, specifically mentioning farming nodes. I answer with "you don't seriously think there are so few nodes in the world that the server can't support an increase in population?" To put it more bluntly, there's tons of nodes in tons of zones, to claim, as you do, that they were farmed to the point there weren't any left is, well, not the brightest view.
---
My point is that you claim a large server would ruin the community aspect, when it's been proven that isn't the case. Yes, if the server gets too large, but even 10K, which is pretty massive, isn't at that point yet.
---
No, that isn't "literally what that means". Just because you know something doesn't mean you won't do something. Murder is against the law, people still do it. People know low level dungeon loot doesn't matter in the long run, people will still feel invested into a minor upgrade blue they get.
---
Blizzard definitely does not have a good track record. If they did WoW wouldnt have been in a decline for almost 10 years now. There's a reason the game population peaked in WoTLK and never got close to old numbers since. Their track record for over a decade now has been to make things even more casual than before, always chasing after that market. This has been apparent across all their IPs, not just Warcraft.
---
Has the Classic Dev team been doing well lately? Pretty well, yeah. Does that make up for over 10 years of Blizzard doing Blizzard things? Not even close.
---
A pretty selfish approach. The world doesn't revolve around you bud.
---
FUCK YES IM SO HAPPY THAT WAS MY LAST CONCERN CLASSIC IS GONNA BE AMAZING
---
&gt; Vanilla becomes Theseus' Ship
---
Love this.
---
The worry was in 5/10 man dungeons, and 5 man more-so, people would be able to run with, say, a group of 4 friends, and pug a 5th member, but due to loot trading, be able to have potentially 4 rolls on an item, then trade it to their buddy in the group that actually needed the item, virtually denying the 5th pug group member a shot at the item.
---
With the blue post linked above, this will not happen in any non raid-locked dungeon for Bind on Pickup items, meaning you wont have people being able to do what I said above, and it'll just be the luck of the roll determining loot, allowing the 5th pug member to have an equal chance at a piece of loot, since the other 4 members wont be able to stack the odds and trade loot to their friend.
---
So all dungeons, just listing the level 60 for pre-raid BiS gear, BRD, Scholo, Strat, LBRS, UBRS, and Dire Maul, will not have loot trading in them. All 20-40 man raids, MC, Onyxia, BWL, ZG, AQ20, AQ40, and Naxx, will have loot-trading active, as this will resolve alot of potential GM tickets through mis-given loot.
---
Is this system still exploitable in PUG raids? Absolutely. Its not much different than the Raid Leader master looting gear to his friends instead of whatever pre-determined loot rules were established though. Ideally, if the Classic WoW server populations and communities are similar to what we experienced in Classic WoW, people who do this will quickly establish a reputation, and will become persona non grata to the server.
---
If they released a 24 hour BETA every month on the 1st, no only would that give them continuous subscription revenue until Classic does release, I would see the $15 as a well worth investment, more time would be appreciated, i'm just saying i'm craving this bad enough to pony the fuck up!
---
Its only other post is a similar comment on a similar post by the same poster.
---
:|
---
Lol probably 🤣
---
Thank you, definitely gives me more to consider :)
---
Yeah, Enh isn't the most competitive spec by any degree but it is fairly unique for a spell-focused melee fighter. Ele will always be the premiere PvP spec for Shamans just because it is more in-line with Shamans baseline strengths and toolkit.
---
Personally, I loved enhance and the challenge of playing a kiting melee spec. Plus the dopamine spike from WF crits doesn't hurt either haha.
---
Activision...if the classic team continue to have this freedom in development alongside the acknowledgment of the community, you have my £10 a month and no doubt a lot more over the course of Classic WoW.
---
This is the blizzard we love; interacting and listening to the community and making fair, balanced changes that make sense and make the game better.
---
&gt;Never tried DM or heard about it.
---
I think he's referring to DM Tribute runs. Not sure. If so - there's a ton of youtube content on the subject.
---
Feign death on 1. What a mad lad. 
---
Something else I noticed: when clicking to make one image bigger, it obviously links to the picture, and then when you go back it resets all the fields. Suggestions from me (maybe bad ones?):
---
* when clicking make images show up in new tab
---
* remember field entries
---
This question is why id rather Classic to get real new development time in the spirit and numbers rather than going into other expansions. Thats the dream, I get if they dont want to split the two wows and leave classic at Naxx. It can work look at Runescape, Im playing that instead of live wow and RS3 becasue its just better and its now even getting extended content and its really really good content for the most part. 
---
While misloots are sometimes annoying, i didnt see loot trading as necessary. Very meh about this. Steady stream of news this past week is nice though.
---
Ha! Fair enough. I was interested in knowing if there was more to know about these classes as far as helping a group goes. I haven't played with a LOT of warlocks, typically being a caster myself.
---
For instance, /u/WittyMatt mentioned possibility of instant summoning a succubus for seduction in an emergency, and the fel hunter dispel and cs. 
---
Rogues can really easily fuck up most mobs of relatively the same level, and allow you to double loot most enemies with pickpocket. Doing this with every enemy you kill all the way to 60 should help you be able to afford a mount by the time you hit cap.
---
Imagine if we followed politics and complained this much as individual nations compared to how we (me too) follows blizz (plz don’t complain about this post, humor only...I think)
---
That's a really good solution, nice job.
---
Yea I would never tell someone not to play a shaman but, I feel the same way about shamans a druids. If you are going to pick one. Their should be no doubt. The class has way too many draw backs. If you aren't 100% dedicated to not caring about them. It may embiter you later. Nothing feels worse then thinking Ele is going to work in MC gear and, getting smashed over and over. While your mage friend laughs in your face and tells you to heal lol. You gotta be sure thats what you want because, it will happen.
---
Sharding isn’t related to server load but rather area overcrowding. 
---
Have you tried seeing a doctor?
---
I predict there will be some sort of change to instance farming compared to what we currently have on private servers. 
---
I don't think you will be able to just /camp /resetinstance() and then login at the entrance but we will see this is just my prediction 
---
That's fine. But if their is a way in the game to progress faster with my friends and it doesnt involve cheating just using actual parts of the game I'm going to use it  
---
Hm, Windfury unlocked at level 30 in TBC, but I really couldn't say with absolute confidencd that it was impossible, just stating my memory of the changes. I inevitably rerolled the first week of TBC because of the changes to WF made my spec feel like a wet noodle, and a %chance effect with an ICD was just too limited on an already unpredictable RNG reliant effect.
---
\&gt;   this will inevitably lead to a serious ganking "problem" on PVP servers 
---
Soooo we have there private servers with 12k peaks, as in 5000-7000 Horde and 5000-7000 Alliance online at once on ONE realm with an international playerbase so the server is packed 24/7. If pvp isn't a "problem" on these realms it's not gonna be a problem on Classic realms.
---
If it could Warlocks wouldn't have threat problems...
---
Yeah :) Guildname was Rival
---
X-perl is customizable.  
---
I think new raids can be made pretty easily. I think they could use new raids to make the specs feel more diverse. So going from the fact we plan on having "changes" if you are adding gear. They could do stuff like turning Arms into less of a crit based spec to make it less like fury. Then make new sets promoting that new play style.
---
I might consider shaman, no interest in playing the others. 
---
That’s why I said it was customized
---
That's easily abused. 3man roll, kick the one whos not in on the scam, then reroll.
---
&gt; clarifying it 
---
Im extremely interested in having some source when you can, because altho I would like it, I am extremely skeptical that they have said anything like that and not have caused a big fuss.
---
Yeah, too many years have passed. I just had a ton of fun as enhance, then switched to ele for TBC. Glass canon mode activated! 
---
To an extent. They still out dps most classes is my guess. More dps than warriors, priests, rogues, shamans, paladin's... They are just beasts but it is a most steady grind than other classes. Don't be fooled though, 3 dots + wand is a lot of dps
---
I didn't even realize they were considering loot trading in dungeons, I always assumed it was always intended for raids, that's where loot distribution mistakes of any consequence happen.
---
You keep trying to avoid and not answer the direct question - Is it expected that people who disagree with some decisions will "bring something on the table" and look for a solution to the game problems? Answering your question, who cares? Unfortunately, I am not alone and a lot people who bring nothing on the table, but for some reason still dare to disagree with sharding from when it became known about it
---
That would be the kind of content I would like to see in Classic if they want to keep it going after releasing everything Pre TBC. 
---
Just flesh out everything that ended up unfinished the first time around.
---
Should of used a meme with Drake. My bad...
---
If I didn't support ganking, I wouldn't play on a PVP server.
---
It's not perfect yet. They could still improve it by making need rolls bind boes. 
---
I gank all horde on sight, unless they’re too high level. I rarely will camp someone, unless they did it to me first. 
---
I've always adhered to the mantra: "There is a PVP solution to every problem." when it comes to inter-player issues in WoW. 
---
Personally, I don't gank. I don't get anything out of it and the lowbies are a waste of an arrow. I absolutely will hunt down gankers though - I find that kind of pursuit incredibly enjoyable. 
---
This is where guilds come into play: get ganked &gt; ask for help from your guild &gt; your guildmates now have an incentive to get out of IF or Org and hunt down some lowlife. 
---
The ganker benefits because now it has some real competition. 
---
The gankee benefits because it's building a better relationship with guildmates. 
---
The counter-ganker benefits because it now has some drive to get out for some WPVP.
---
Damn, just noticed the annoying typo in the heading -\_-
---
&gt;Sure, the people you meet in the opposing faction might not have flagged themselves, but that just means they don't want the rivalry to be on at that time.
---
See the problem is this completly negates the idea of it being an "authentic" horde vs allaince conflict becasue its not authentic at that point. 
---
Why cant they just add 1 of each RP server, What really is it going to take these days? They dont use physical servers anymore so im guessing not a lot, I can only assume they dont want to split the rp community since its small already maybe? But all you are going to do is piss off half of your RPers.  
---
I LOVE YOU
---
I don't think there will be as much interest in Classic as people around here assume. Sure it was great at the time, but after all it's a 14 years old game with pretty outdated combat and just too slow progression for the current market.  
---
I know I will play it, but knowing myself, I really doubt my interest will last for more than couple of months.
---
&gt;he 15 foot tall burning infernal crushing their proportionally tiny skull between its… Do rocks have fingers? Who cares kid, just think of the power.
---
Basically, it all depends in how much warlocks you have. Generally one has to keep CoE, other CoS on the boss but others were free to use everything. With the later debuff cap not being so strict, I could always keep CoA and Corruption on the boss and then yeah, SB spam - since fire spells were useless.  
---
To be honest with no real BiS gear but tiers mostly, I was always competing with mages and others for the top spots.  
---
On trash you DS a lot, gotta keep those HS-s coming. Your imp is basically on passive near the tanks so they get the Blood Pact so don't count on him much.  
---
Also with a warlock OOM doesn't exist. At 10% mana you go for a few lifetaps and you can do everything again.
---
I think an easy solution to this is counter punishment, if you report a player for abuse/harassment and it's very easy for a GM to see that person was in fact not doing that, then 72 hour ban everyone involved with reporting the player.              
---
I mean the case is going to be reviewed by a GM at some point anyways and if the threat of a ban keeps people from abusing the system this just seems like the simplest solution, punish the punishers and people will treat it with reservation.
---
Even without world buffs or overgearing content every instance in the game has at minimum one boss that is easiest when done with a fury tank. You could tank Onyxia wearing a dress and no shield. Then whenever adds spawn or a boss enrages just hit the swap macro.
---
It is engaging and a good thing to learn.
---
yea i remember the fuckers who posted this everytime someone asked for classic servers on the wow forums, it still kinda triggers me to read it now but atleast we can laugh knowing we won in the end :)
---
 My thoughts on this are that it doesn't matter because it's not changing in Classic.  
---
This is really good.  I appreciate this so much.
---
I think it's more likely that they've established a pattern of behavior with the posts. If they continue to get good feedback and a positive response from posting at this frequency, it'd make sense that they continue to do so. It makes them look good. Looking good makes us more likely to stay engaged. Us being more engaged means we're more likely to buy into Classic as an idea and eventually, pay a sub for the product.
---
Communication = profit.
---
Ahh yes. The good old days of The Federation during wotlk. I joined in wrath so I can’t speak for the days in vanilla, although from what I’ve heard it was poppin.
---
How about the Ret tree?
---
That's how my rolls for rare drop mounts go. I've never won one in my 20 years of playing mmorpgs.
---
&gt;Well, yea. No shit. Who likes getting camped in redridge inn by some no-life level 60 rogue for 6 hours straight? Lmfao
---
But thats the reason they want an RP-PvP realm. I think they are all mental but they want to get camped in redridge. It hurts nothing giving them a single server per region to all play on right? 
---
Sort of.  It's lower WW damage once every 10 sec vs more heroic strikes. A 2.0 vs a 2.5 means 4 HS vs 5 HS every 10 sec (no flurry consideration).   If the difference in WW damage &lt; the difference of heroic strike added damage, 2.0 wins.  Say for 50 dps weapons, ww difference is a measly 25, and an extra heroic strike is 138 (157 after aq).  Upshot is, on Vael for example, CHT beats BB. Extra threat might get you killed but meh.
---
Also with overpower, it's lit up more often with a fast weapon. Roughly, 2.0 has a 5% higher "uptime" for overpower than 2.5, so you have to compare more "proc.s" vs difference in avg weapon damage, plus the fact that you'll be getting the small overpower bonus more often. It's a little more complicated than that because a dodge can come when overpower is on cd.
---
It's 50g/hr.
---
I would avoid changing established content too much, rather build on it with content that should have been there / would fit in the game.
---
"people bitch that classic wow is just going to be a BFA server capped at level 60, Stop complaining and just support blizzard! You are getting what you wanted!"
---
Totally, I agree. I think expecting to be treated as the equivalent role in raids would be farsical, but with dedication you can make anything work if your group is overall fairly casuap in their raiding expectations. Shaman is support at the end of the day, and all players rolling support characters should not act surprised or offended when they are asked to heal. Just as a warrior should not be surprised when they are asked to tank. It may not be your spec but you should be willing to accommodate as it is inevitably your role.
---
Well then I hope your pc/laptop breaks 🙂
---
Keep in mind that shaman are generally terrible tanks. Really slow due to mana constraints - and your avoidance and mitigation falls behind all other classes. They *can* do it in 5-mans and even UBRS, but it’s sub-optimal. Don’t be dissuaded by also having a healing shaman. Totem overlap is small enough that it won’t be a problem. 
---
There’s a fairly in-depth guide on YouTube [here] (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ej4iI-b6pXo).

Mod abuse: [no loot trading in UBRS (clarification from Kaivax).](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/loot-trading-in-classic/131586/111)
---
/sit crit will not be on classic s it was patched earlier in vanilla.
---
Nothing hypocritical about it, I miss the great community of hardcore players and casuals can fuck off.
---
Just kidding, I love everyone from casuals to Chinese gold farmers to RP’ers. May the eyes of the earth mother watch over you.
---
Personally, I want the option to report someone via right-click to exist.  I think that's a fantastic change.    However, I have always been, and will always be, opposed to that being tied to *any* sort of automated punishment including but not limited to squelch/silence/ban/etc

And those who get there for their free epics wont ever play it again. Whats the point here? We should have dead content than content few players play?
---
2.03 was still vanilla(for just as long as 1.12 was) and the summoning part was added then. The LFG UI was added in that patch also, but the back-end wasn't plugged in until BC.
---
Pretty sure by 1.12 the upper limits on dungeons had been set at 5 with a few exceptions like BRS.
---
Drakkisath in UBRS is ??. Rivendare is only 62, along with the other 5 man bosses.
---
That's not what I said at all.... I said the information is easier to find now, for people who care. I feel like you don't remember how different the internet was 10 years ago for such things.
---
Its a business, Yes if enough people say it they will reconsider an aspect. Look at loot trading, Its been mosty fixed from its terrible previous state and complaining got us there. 
---
What?  Some people just dont want shitty specs to raid with them.  Plenty of guilds dont care.
---
If you're helping 39 other people complete something that they wouldn't be able to do without you they better give you something for it.
---
Very happy with the solution. Sounds great guys. 
---
That's not how it works on the 1.12 private servers. 
---
that UBRS news was after my comment, glad to know it's excluded.
---
But still, this change effectively kills PUG raids, which was quite common in private servers (MCs, ZG, Ony, even BWL)
---
Nah fuck Alterac Valley. It's not a big deal.
---
For real though, I found Gold Farmers very fascinating. I was shocked to learn it was actually a thing.
---
And way back then: The prospect of being a game master and making $14 an hour to sit and help players in WoW. Sounded amazing to young me. Shame I didn't live in Texas.
---
*Powerful sax solo*
---
Stance dancing is not as intimidating as it might seem. Only really 5 abilities, all of which can be macrod into the stance swap. Berserk stance to use rage for fear, intercept. Battle stance has charge, thunderclap and mocking blow (second taunt).
---
And the video I mentioned earlier  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u\_azvBdVgz0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_azvBdVgz0)  You never HAVE to learn this. It's just makes the game more fun, makes some fights easier, looks badass.
---
Did blizz pay u to write this cuckboy?
---
&gt; It hurts nothing giving them a single server per region to all play on right?
---
Until the server population is garbage and requires merging and ends up fucking up another, perfectly fine server. I'm all for containment servers for furries and lolis, but c'mon.
---
The problem with making it group type is you can do 5-man dungeons in a raid group, just only 5 people can go in the instance.  So you can convert your 5-man to a raid and then trade loot around negating this change.
---
It was intersting to be part of the BC RI and see it grow into what it was. Sad to see them gone now but thats how it goes in modern wow. Maelstrom was always fun.
---
I cant wait to find me a casual chill guild that wants to at some point raid on weekends, my favorite way of finding those good guilds back in the day was by running a dungeons             
---
            
---
They would go "Hey man, nice job with the tanking/CC/heals!"            
---
I go "Thanks hommie, I try."                 
---
They go "Yo we need good peeps like you in our guild, I see your unguilded, want those guild spams to stop?"                 
---
          
---
To which I reply "Yeah boi send me that clicky click for Big Miss Steak!"               
---
All is right in the universe.
---
Not if you think it all the way through.   If they make it work based on group type, you can just convert to raid and still loot trade in 5-mans.  I believe they're choosing lockout vs group type for the reasons they stated, but also to head off this loophole (or more specifically to head off any whining about said loophole existing).
---
You can go play the 2006 version on private servers right now, complete with #nochanges graphics and old client. Nothing is stopping you. Why you want to kill the only decent version of WoW that can exist for everyone else, is beyond me.
---
Big ouch to paladin reckoning leveling.
---
I used to have some old pictures of my rogue on the very top of the building in Booty Bay where the Bell tower was. I always loved exploring and getting areas to take cool screenshots. 
---
Yeah just thought id help spread the word more incase someone else comes looking to ask the same thing. 
---
I was there day one! I was new to RP but I loved it. Being on a brand new server was so exciting. Was tauren shaman in Mistrunner tribe, then I switched to alliance, was a gnome called sprack can't remember what guild but I think got RP married.
---
I've pugged with friends and have had to team up on the group leader when we joined to get him to turn off ML and give up group lead.
---
Don't do it by group, by who was eligible when it dropped.
---
So what is the solution for loot mistakes in dungeons? Seems like "tough luck, fuck off" to me.
---
Remember after just a week or so highest level was 30, us Taurens and a big troll guild raided ashenvale and got wtf pwned. Some of my best gaming memories ever
---
But any group doing that would obviously be up to something, negating the "but teh ninjas" argument you guys keep putting forth.
---
If the server population is that shocking then the players can move and blizzard can shut it down saving themselves the 14 pence it cost to put that server up. 
---
&gt;I'm all for containment servers for furries and lolis, but c'mon.
---
Yes they are called RP servers. You remove the ability to have an RP-PvP server and what do you think is going to happen to your PvP server? They most likely wont just leave they will play a regular PvP server and continue their doings only now you are forced to engage with them because they are guildies or that guy in your pug etc. 
---
Well put. Even AV from 1.12 is a result of community feedback. They didn’t want PVE elements, so most of them were removed or nerfed.
---
The community didn’t want a “guild gap,” so Dire Maul and ZG were designed as catch up instances, allowing rapid bypass of other raids.
---
The community didn’t want long queues, so they got cross-realm BGs.
---
The community didn’t want the difficulty of coordinating teams and travel, so they got meeting stones (auto-grouping, summoning, the LFG in TBC)
---
World of Warcraft has *always* given the people exactly what they thought they wanted. 
---
Dunno. I removed those errors in my own copy. 
---
Not all gankers are assholes... but every asshole I know is a ganker.
---
What ladder?
---
Can confirm, killed a level 40 paladin on a lvl 19 twink rogue.
---
In your experience do people stay around and humour you when you barrage them with questions like an entitled twat?
---
This is already the case with 1.12.1 client BoP loot. 
---
I want to appreciate this Item:
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?item=11193](https://classicdb.ch/?item=11193)
---
Quest reward, it's so fucking good for the LvL. 23 Dex is INSANE.
---
Thank you !
---
whoa whoa whoa, who is you guys? 
---
I was FOR loot trading because I personally don't see any issue with it.  I also don't see 2/5 or 3/5 or 4/5 of the group having 2/5, 3/5, or 4/5 of the say in where the loot goes as being ninja looting in anyway.
---
I'm saying this would introduce a loophole allowing loot trading in 5 mans, which is something *some* vocal players don't want.  Blizz prevents both the loophole AND the players bitching about said loophole all at the same time.
---
Azshara love 
---
Former or ladder
---
Well it used to be a roll for Need/Greed/Pass. Obviously if you were rolling need then there was no reason you were trading the item with someone else so the BoP wasn't really an issue.
---
There was an option you could change to have the party leader be loot master or you could select free loot ( I can't remember exactly what is was called). When in free loot anyone could come up to the boss and select the item they wanted. I believe while picking up an item that was BoP it did give you a warning. But it was been close to 10 year since I last played. (Stopped mid WotLk)
---
Or former of ladder? Like a carpenter?
---
I like the shared tagging with scaling, but not 1 per player more like +.5 monster hp per player, so grouping is more valuable. maybe -2.5% xp per person.
---
&gt; I have played a lot of Vanilla, from raiding into Naxx on Stormreaver US in the guild Bloodthirst and raiding and capping on over 8 different toons, but **my dream has been to RP** through that adventure. 
---
\&gt;writes "manifesto" about RP servers
---
\&gt;admits never having played on an RP server
---
i r8 this 8/8 m8
---
Ofc it affects cast speed. Stop with the alternative facts 😉
---
Several quests yeah, one for each upgrade
---
Thanks for answer
---
You think people want to read that, but they don't.
---
That's a really selfish attitude that will have a toxic effect on the community as a whole.  
---
Keep that shit in retail where it belongs.
---
Not when you roll for it though I believe. That would only be when picking up something from a chest or something everyone has passed on. 
---
My brothers level 1 twink often beat level 15-20s
---
One of my favorite zones. The mood was perfect.
---
Hell yeah 
---
Don't hate on casuals. They fuel the Honor system.
---
If a player goes through 60 levels of Classic and gets pre-raid geared, but doesn’t know the risks of running raids as it pertains to loot...
---
Then I feel for them, but they’ll have to learn eventually. I’m sure they will have been screwed over by a hunter before that point anyways 🤪
---
Well put, I agree!
---
I actually RP'd in Vanilla as shammy and my toons on retail are on RP servers, what I haven't done is go 1-60 raid, and main a Vanilla RP server. 
---
Nobody cares. 
---
Blizzards approach on Classic has been stellar so far. Getting more excited by the day. 
---
Oh definitely, as long as it's not something the main raiders need or was stated to be reserved before the raid started. 
---
Aside from that ask for something in return, don't expect it. My old guild had a tank problem and most of the time we had to bring in a random, 9/10 they would ask for a specific piece of gear if it dropped for compensation. 
---
This is true of all hybrids honestly. Paladins are an unplayable mess, raw HPS and usefulness of the buffs notwithstanding. Shaman is an inferior healer as well as being awful in every role. Druids are undesirable period.
---
It doesn't stop there, Expect no more than 1 or 2 Hunters per raid.
---
This is going to be nothing but rogues, mages and warriors.
---
&gt;but cloning characters from Classic to AP servers would have to be a thing
---
I've never understood the appeal of keeping classic open in the same 1.12 state forever as if it's a museum piece. Vanilla was constantly changing every 2 weeks with new patches when it was out and people loved that. Private servers die every 6 months once Naxx is completed because sitting at 1.12 forever is boring.
---
All classic wow servers should follow the OSRS alternate progression model.
---
I think we should begin with getting into Classic before discussing its successor. They need feedback from the community on design decisions and combining how-it-was with good design-choices present day. 
---
With Classic the developers are slowly weaning themselves of from retail-developing. They're going to be all over the place with runny noses and sniveling for a while but once they get back on track you should start asking these types of questions.
---
My head hurts. 
---
Private servers have given people bad ideas about classic simply because private servers are replicas of vanilla, not the real thing. All of the values outside of shown stats are created by the creator of the servers. Say ironfoes proc rate. We don't actually know what it should be. Creature pathing is wrong as well as server input lag/ general lag.
---
Had to go off the road to see him, and he blended in with others so if you didn't know, just another mob. Which at lvl 12 or so back at launch, no meme for jogger then
---
But stitches was massive and walking down the road
---
Is that the beginning of an epic mount race in Ironforge I'm seeing?
---
Doesn't show when I Google it. Is it a regional thing? 
---
Are you gonna play it?
---
They would, but its not like they would have to design a whole new area, just npcs and a few mechanics to slow the games down. The quick AV's are so less intense than the days long war that AV can became, where you build rivals during games from fighting with the same enemy players for so long and get a huge sense of pride and accomplishment when winning a game or sour taste of defeat when losing one. I loved it
---
Every raid should have a single ret/enh, and oomkin in it. They should serve as the DPS benchmark.
---
As guild leader, I’d be very happy to see those two specs at the bottom of every fight and perturbed if they were in the middle or higher. (Gear gaps and fight mechanics considered)
---
Well, I guess I'll be resigning my job now instead of just taking vacation.
---
Name changing is simple enough to follow actually. Put only ninjas on ignore / friends list on an alt - whenever they name change the ignore list will keep them on it. Notify the forums of the changed name.
---
Corruption maybe (NF procs), but probably not CoA.  16 debuffs among 40 people doesn't make it a free-for-all.  There's still sunders, winter's chill, Expose armor (?), the improved shadow bolt crit debuff, among others.
---
For DPS this is true. That being said plenty of us like to heal and play support. I plan on playing a rogue this time but thats because this is my fourth rodeo. My first 3 were Shaman, Priest, and Hunter. They are all very fun. I would play them again if my life had unlimited hours. That being said if you wanna be a dps don't pick a support. Don't be that guy unless you are willing to deal with the consequences of being super non-optimal.
---
Ya know, I really don’t like esfand, I mean I can’t wait for classic wow. But all the classic wow youtubers I’ve seen are pretty low quality. Maybe is cause they are just starting out? 
---
Idk nothing against him personally just don’t like his channel I guess 
---
Slippery slope.
---
Thanks for the quality Classic content!
---
Damn I just learned alot and now I am 10 IQ higher
---
eh if you are geared enough
---
looks like you need good items especially rogue
---
*wink*
---
Another bad video, thanks Staysafetv :)
---
this is a damn good thread, just had to upvote
---
hmm, strange choice on their part, but I guess it'll be nice to have some items be good from the get go, Savage gladiators chain vest springs to mind!
---
Great Content
---
Hey, StaySafeTV, I really enjoy the content and it is extremely useful. Thank you for the work you do. ;)
---
Yup!
---
To the moon, boys
---
I had no idea you could do that, thats crazy.
---
Its interesting how many quests you can fit into a route like this. I need to check my routes.
---
And thus the game is same than retail wow in a year. You need to care, you need to voice your opinions on things that matter. If you are too lazy for that I question how much you really care about the game; the least you could do is stop leaving comments like these encouraging similar behavior to yourself.
---
Terrible video.
---
Retail is trash
---
Loot trading allows for a higher chance of loot getting stolen in dungeons. You'd have people roll for loot they don't actually need (they'd generally equip a weaker green during the run) and pass it on to their friend after the run.
---
&gt; So let's chill the fuck out and let Blizzard take control of the wheel. 
---
Yeah, no thanks.
---
No flying and city raids are the 2 biggest things I'm looking forward to with Classic WoW
---
Theres a lot of good info here, but its all over the place, heres some simple tips for starters.
---
You can be Arms and tank any 5/10 man. If tanking is your thing you may as well respec Prot at 60 and do tons of dungeons.
---
Threat is what you need, your DPS is only to get you more threat.
---
A beginner advice, sunder everything at least once in a group if its 5 or less mobs without CC, make sure your healer isnt being hit, keep your head up and check none made it past you.
---
If DPS pull mobs off you, its OK (in dungeons), dont go chasing after mobs attacking DPS and let your healer pull agro.
---
Youll learn how much threat you need on the main target and how much you need to prevent healer agro and be able to balance it out ("feel it out" so to speak) eventually, but when you start, just save the healer, if you do then 90% of your runs will be successful
---
Thank you for sharing your wisdom with us! We are not worthy.
---
Oh, no. The ability to submit tickets to GMs for fixes is still there! This is just a solution for a *reduction* of that workload. It won't be a quick fix, like loot trading, but it's still an option - and that option is true to Vanilla. 
---
It's all kind of muddled up with the negativity here, but the GM ticket approach *isn't going away* just because we're getting loot trading for certain stuff. GM tickets still exist in retail because people often automatically equip upgrades, even if it wasn't intended for them.
---
I just like to fish.
---
Obviously I had such crazy high DPS with auto attack on F1 that I needed to be able to feign quickly.
---
I actually remember when I first got feign death at 30: i got ganked by a 31 orc warrior in Desolace with whirlwind axe, feigned death at ~20% hp and he actually though I was dead. Walked away to get something to eat only to realize that after the 6 minute timer of feigning death, you actually did die.
---
Fair enough point, but some examples like the suggestion about having a quest for the Druid Cat form could be fun to have at launch.
---
We already won 6 content phases and no loot trading, keep it up. They are obviously listening, make noise about this and it will be gone from classic soon enough. 
---
Personally I would be fine with the middle-line solution, keep right click report but don't have any part of it automated. The automated mute/temporary ban whatever is what's the real danger. Though I would prefer the feature not being in the game at all but can we reasonably expect that?
---
Clueless answer...
---
Yes it is expected by disagreeing with something you are inheritly saying there is something better to replace that. If you don't have any idea on how to solve the problem sharding is fixing then don't complain or don't be surprised when your opinion isn't taken seriously or considered. Also some people do agree with you but at least they try to help by coming up with possible fixes instead of just complaining.
---
I didn’t RP much in Vanilla but I was on lightninghoof (RPPvP) and let me tell you, it is a big deal. Sorry I’m not sorry about being a bit annoyed, and no I honestly will not play it without a RPPvP server at release. Pantheon will be our soonish anyway. 
---
&gt; OSRS alternate progression model
---
As somebody that never played RS, could you explain how that worked?
---
Look up Esfand on YouTube - two videos called “the light and how to swing it”, has him topping meters in ubrs and brd by a considerable margin. Ret can be viable but you gotta use a lot of consumes and have a weird gear combo! 
---
They should introduce new raids and dungeons without a power creep and make them equal. Would be more fun. 
---
Yes, and I saw a fish in the frozen section in the supermarket once. That makes me a certified marine biologist.
---
Yes, and people will leave those groups in a heartbeat and post names on the forums too.
---
I'm here to give you karma
---
cool life
---
nice sample text in the first panel
---
Do you really die? I’ve leveled multiple hunters on pservers and I never feigned death for the whole 6 min
---
This is great! Actually you can just type the name of the item in the "search for Ids:" field and it will find the id for you. Only thing I noticed are some items seem to  be missing like spellweaver's tuban. 
---
&gt; If they "release Classic first, then maybe release RPPvP server" then RPPvP is dead on arrival. What are people going to do? Reroll their characters after months of playing? Not going to happen.
---
You do realise that the game didn't launch with RP-PvP servers right? They were added in Patch 1.8, and yes, people did reroll their characters on there if they wanted to play there. 
---
&gt;That's a completely disingenuous argument. There are masses of surveys, both internal and external, that Blizzard has access to. There are google metrics and other additional data.
---
On the contrary, it is entirely disingenuous to claim that surveys and google metrics mean anything in the context of how popular Classic is going to be. The only way for Blizzard to know how many people are actually going to not only check out Classic but actually stick with it beyond the first month or two is to actually release the game. 
---
That’s a phenomenal compromise. Based on the most recent updates it appears that they really are interested in the community feedback.
---
275 aoe threat, which means its divided between all mobs that have you on their threat table. Its great threat against 1-4 mobs, but demo shout is still useful if you there are more than that
---
So raid leaders accidentally giving an epic plate piece to a mage? Sounds much better 
---
Right I did too, I mean if given a choice, yes gimmie long AVs but with all the data restoration work they are already doing I dont think AV should delay the game.            
---
I think they should have both quick Av for those who hated the long ones and 1.8 AV for us who enjoy the days of yore but this is something they can do post launch.
---
No i can't. Private servers are inaccurate as fuck.
---
Again, if you want a babbys first mmo IT'S ALREADY THERE FOR YOU. Go play the one you ruined with your bitching and leave ours alone.
---
Guys, try to actually appreciate the nicknames they have now, and remember back in the days where names like *xXKillerXx*, *ShadowhunterDK* and *ĄƧƧäʂɨƝ* where flourishing.
---
I actually appreciate this screenshot, not by its rolls and comedy effect, but by their cool nicknames
---
Its ninja looting because its done in a sneaky and underhanded way.
---
Your example in your post of a Warrior and a pally both needing the piece, will have one of them not actually need the piece, but pretend to need it to increase the chances of his buddy getting it. They do this behind the back of the other members of the group, however, which is the real kicker. And its rarely just 2 people, it's usually 4, and that means an 80% chance to win any piece of loot vs a 20% chance to win for the one pug.
---
If they reserved items upfront before things started, and people accepted those loot rules, it would be fine.
---
-I had fun in 1.5 av
---
-I had fun in 1.12 av
---
-i had more fun with CRBG than I did without it
---
-As long as sharding is restricted to launch week I will continue to have fun 
---
-If a guild group used loot trading to ninja something from me, I would make a note and never group with that guild again unless I was ML
---
-i have no fear of getting squelched because I can always log on an alt and go solo stuff/farm ore and herbs
---
The only thing that matters to me is how the game plays. The mechanics, the talents, the ability to out-think/out-plan the NPCs. That's what I care about. All this other crap is just squawking for the sake of making noise.
---
&gt; It's not so bad in retail where everything is automated and you don't  need to say anything, but having a group of players able to silence any  player they want will wreck havoc in this game. 
---
The right-click report **and** auto-squelch features have been in the game since May of 2007. Are you going to claim that everything in TBC was automated and you didn't need to say anything?
---
Imagine the after Naxx was out for a while the developers started running polls to see what content and features people did and didn't want added to Classic. If more than 75% of the active playerbase vote for something then the developers implement it. Sometimes it could be content that existed later in WoW's cycle like Karazhan. Sometimes it could be entirely new content that never existed in regular WoW.
---
That's effectively what OSRS did.
---
I'm pretty sure they don't have it anymore.  I don't think they can give us pre-1.12 AV.
---
This is a massive positive turn. Wtf is blizz actually listening. Its all coming back to me.. The dream is real
---
You guys as in the community as a whole, not as you specifically.
---
Your position is a reasonable one.
---
Shit, and here I am rounding up everyone I know to play WoW with me.
---
After all, we can all afford the $15 per month easily this time.
---
...except for the one dude.
---
If other classes use a lot of consumes will they still surpass a Paladin that does the same?
---
Good times, wish there was a similar project. Regards, Storpuppa &lt;Rival&gt;
---
Well if they are still going to have GM tickets for looting then I misunderstood. Probably because that was the suggestion on here so often, I was under the impression that they wouldn't be doing GM tickets for loot in dungeons, seems to be what a lot of people in the thread think too. I guess I can't actually find it confirmed either way so maybe I jumped the gun on that, but I'd be really disappointed if they left no way to fix loot mistakes in dungeons.
---
Don't like it?  
---
Play on a pve server.
---
Mine as well. Hoping they relay alot of feedback to the retail dev team. I haven't seen the majority of players this happy in along time and maybe ever.
---
The two types of discussions aren't mutually exclusive.
---
Its infinitely more difficult to adjust and change those things after release compared to before release. Once they release with something, it sets a precedent, which has very far reaching ramifications.
---
I would be more concerned with the Idols for the Head/Leg enchants in ZG than with the Raptor/Tiger mounts, as these are the sole reason alot of people will still run ZG once AQ40/Naxx drops.
---
Are we going to see guild runs that only kill Bloodlord / Jin'do for their members enchants? Most likely. But for members that are "down the list" to get their Idols, I could see them pugging. 
---
On the pservers that I've played on, the Idols are the only items I see as "reserved" besides the mounts. And I mean reserved as in the Raid Leader or someone predetermined is getting them, you cant have them as your "MS / OS +1 Reserve" item. 
---
I think that when u roll on a pvp server u accept ganking so its fair game
---
otherwise go pve
---
I dont trust Blizzard or Ion anymore but credit where credit is due this is giving me a strange huge swell of hope that maybe the old Blizzard is still in there somewhere trapped under mounds of money, stock holder meetings and red tape.              
---
If they can keep it up with the communication and maybe hire back ythisens because that was some bull shit I very well could see myself reversing position again. 
---
They changed it after launch when they put them in, they can take them out just as easy and if they are truly as toxic as you all fear then it would be met with thunderous applause 
---
Warrior is most, without exception.
---
Least, rogue could take that spot.
---
Pvp frost mage / ele shamy  
---
Pve bm hunter/ warlock
---
&gt; Or, to use a tired phrase, to just 'git gud.' 
---
It's true though, if you're good you can still "win" vs gankers.
---
I don't mean you kill them, but you can enforce your will on them by not allowing them to do what they want...which is impede your gameplay.
---
I've been leveling alliance on pserver recently to refine my leveling route for classic release.
---
A few stories:
---
3 man rogue group ganking in lakeshire.  Two of them open on me while the other waits in stealth.  I'm able to outplay them, kill 1 while keeping one poly'd, until the 3rd one jumps me.
---
End up getting away at 10 health, throwing up mana shield just in time as one tries to bow me down while sitting in frost nova.
---
Those guys wanted to kill me so bad, they chased me all the way to duskwood spamming /chicken, but I got to the Inn safely and healed up.
---
Few minutes later some ppl start complaining in /1 that rogues are ganking them lol....
---
-------
---
Yesterday I was taking the boat from Ratchet to Booty Bay.  I see some XX Mage taking a particular interest in me....trying to be sneaky but keeps facing his character towards me while waiting for the boat to leave.
---
I know exactly what he's going to do, try to kill me so I'm dead when the boat crosses zones forcing me to rez at the spirit healer.
---
So I move my character to the edge of the upper boat deck.  Sure enough he starts casting frostbolt when the boat is moving, so I just jump over the ledge to LoS him, throw up fireward and run around below deck while he chases me around.
---
We zone over to booty bay and once I'm safely to the booty bay guards I start spamming /rofl and /no at him.
---
Then I go and furiously beat off to the boner I got from that.
---
-----------
---
Finally if it's just some level 60 corpse camping you in the middle of nowhere, just go afk for 5 minutes so they leave out of boredom.  Problem solved.
---
Those dynamic situations are some of the most enjoyable experiences you can have, but most of you just don't pay full attention to the gam while you eat cheetos and listen to linkin park, so you die and get mad instead.
---
I've been playing since Vanilla and you've just taught me this.  I've mained a rogue for easily 75% of these 15 years. 
---
I getcha. They've been doing tickets for dungeons for like... 17 years now. I doubt they'd stop, especially when you can *still* submit loot tickets in retail.
---
We don't know that they will take it out after. Given their track record of Retail over the past decade+, we can't trust them to do that. Better to not have those things in in the first place.
---
I had no clue this was a thing because I was in middle school during clsssic but NEED this to come again (it won’t) out to save as a relic 
---
False reports will get you perma-banned faster
---
Well played.
---
Ah cool, so we'd get to give some input for a situation like:
---
Launch BC in two months?
---
1. No, need more time in Naxx.
---
2. Yes, bring on the felreavers.
---
54 Hunter with my 19 Rogue with a healer and some... fodder helping
---
I raided Naxx in Vanilla. I'm quite aware of the situation of 1.12. I just hope people recognize that it isn't just 'support classes' that were bad at DPS. Hunters and Warlocks were terrible too. Many progression guilds took only one or two of each of them to progression raids.
---
Expect top guilds to have 8 or more Warriors and Mages in their comps.
---
That's ok because no one got approved for it. None of us knew what credit was back then nor cared. At least in my town.
---
That's probably correct as to my experience. I agree that there's no reason not to have RP-PVP servers and I would probably roll on one. 
---
Damn... expired
---
You should be able to. She won’t be able to join guilds, start parties, or use some chat channels (I think?), but you should still be able to invite her to a party of your own. I believe she also has access to LFD.
---
One thing to keep in mind that you may or may not be aware of, however, is that the payment system was altered with BFA. You no longer need to buy the full game and can just subscribe to access everything before BFA. So, if she wants a few extra perks and the option to level past 20, she needs only throw in $15 for a month and call it good.
---
I agree with this, but I feel that during and post WotLK, the design philosophy also began to shift.
---
This could also have been due to player feedback influencing the team and the new members.
---
Literally my classic dream team, fuck an optimized group (I've done the "we can do MC in 40 minutes" thing already), give me this mess and some beers and I'll have a good raid night.
---
The Classic team is completely detached from the main Blizzard design team and decision makers writ large. They've been given a mandate for Classic specifically, and sure they're doing a good job.
---
***THE REST OF BLIZZARD*** however is still a complete pile of horse manure. Don't kid yourself.
---
Interesting point, and as another redditor pointed out, it was probably my specific RP-PVP realm that got abandoned by RPers. 
---
Yeah, they could add 6 new raids just so most specs have Tier 1, 2, and 3 sets. Having 6 new Legendaries to work towards would be pretty fun as well.
---
There's plenty of room to design new raids that don't power creep Naxx.
---
The items in the bags are a tell tale sign that the character is old world haha
---
Sorry, I can't tell you. The lizard people are watching me
---
Youve seen them drop, no need to be a bragger... 
---
Geuniunely, are you okay?
---
How many people do you really think
---
1: Visit realm forums
---
2: Give enough of a shit about ninja looting in a 5-man to remember the name
---
They’ll turn on ML as the boss is pulled. 
---
No, not necessarily but right now I personally believe that trying to discuss both and weaving that into the general feedback of Classic is not wise. 
---
Consider many of their decisions prior to overruling them and acquiescing to community feedback. How well could they be expected to create *new* content with how the current state of Retail WoW looks like as their experience and background? Give them a chance to realign themselves with Classic before demanding new content (in my opinion).
---
Yeah, I can understand that point. I agree, but I also don't have a good grasp on the actual RP-PvP population and if it'd be enough to warrant two different kinds of RP servers. I know that I'd always pick no-PVP for my rp experience, but I also understand the allure of a more realistic war experience. If they made only RP-PvP and no PvE I'd probably move on to the PvP even if it's not my preference. It's complicated, I worry more about the total population and the server's ability to keep it healthy long term. As I said, I'm very ignorant on the numbers involved.
---
 /2 *then
---
So weird seeing everyone get tribal about casual VS hardcore just over forum discussion. 
---
Naw I just ask important questions to gain another person's perspective on issues so as to understand their point of view better.
---
Warlocks are by no means terrible because they have no hit in their spec tree. It takes them more time and gear to get off the ground. That being said Warlocks may not be the "highest" dps but they do hella work and have plenty of other support abilities. Hunters were just boody doo though. One of the reasons why I am not on team #nochanges. I would like #mildchanges but I am a heretic in that.
---
You do indeed!
---
You recommend Orc Warlock for the Blood Fury, since you say it's "25% increased spell damage", but isn't it 25% increased attack power only?
---
Yes it was an analogy not my personal history. Good on you for caring about vets though. Am related to quite a few and people don't really understand what they go through.
---
They are going to provide to me, the customer, everything that I want so I pay money for it? Absolutely terrible business philosophy.
---
And really... I want to report those spammers. Right click reporting was necessary because of how popular the game got. The first thing you had to do when entering a city was right-click report 10 gold spammers. But I don't want to open a GM ticket every time someone spams a gold selling site.
---
3rd eye: OPENED
---
The thing is, they've only done changes that make the game more and more faithful to real Vanilla. They haven't announced any changes that deviate from a more authentic experience. (And by "changes" I mean deviations from their original release plan - 4 content phases, loot sharing everywhere, etc...)
---
Feel better?
---
You came looking.
---
 [https://www.wowace.com/projects/xperl](https://www.wowace.com/projects/xperl)   There ya go. But when Classic comes out I would check with Zperl instead. . or pitbull. . or ElvUI.  
---
Here is Xperl from about 1.12 if I recall.   [https://i.imgur.com/sjCozr3.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/sjCozr3.jpg) 
---
Have a great day space cowboy :)
---
They don't care about you, they only care about money. They are called bLIZARD for a reason.
---
Nice anecdote.
---
I hope you are right. It just seems to be the consensus that we won't get it here and on the forums, but I should wait until we hear from Blizzard.
---
This is a really excellent solution, one that I really fucking hope will eliminate the need for any more  threads about loot trading. Like damn, I almost unsubbed from here due to the fact that number of threads for that and AV. 
---
Well "other projects" (like WoW) are going into entirely new territory, while the Classic team has pretty much just consistently made everything "more authentic to Vanilla." 
---
Level eighteen
---
You're seriously going to let a minor server difference ruin your classic experience? I mean the only difference between an RpPvP server and a PvP server is literally the name. There's no other differences. There will be RP players on PvP servers and PvE servers no matter if there's RP attached to the name or not. If Moonguard-US was a regular PvE server nothing would change.
---
I'll be looking for a GamerDads guild which is chilled like this :)
---
This is a disaster, this will allow raid members to buy/sell/trade raid loot from each other.
---
Keep in mind you can always merge a PvE server into a PvP server but never the other way around.
---
Good stuff, Teeb.
---
Insert arewethebadguys.gif 
---
Owl with screech. It will generate a bit of aoe threat, reduce the damage mobs are doing, and it won’t break sheep.
---
Great decision
---
All I see is anti hardcore circle jerk all day.
---
Warrior, Rogue, Shaman, Pally are probably all out. Weapon damage is huge for these melee classes, and having a shit weapon will stop you from killing people. Probably least gear dependent both PvP and PvE is probably Druid. In bear and dire bear, you get a huge health and armor boost, in cat you get a huge damage boost, and when not shapeshifted, you only need mana to root and heal. 
---
Interesting that they didn't mention their original reasoning of saving GM time. Is it safe to assume we could still ticket a 5man loot drop to change hands?
---
Can’t wait for dat sweet 4 melee 1 shaman run throughs 👌👌
---
Right. I was just saying we don't yet know what addons will be available, and we can't use what's available now as a rule to say what will be on launch.
---
Yeah. Murlocs. They get me too.
---
Oh, I could be wrong about not breaking sheep. Some sources I’m seeing say it does damage. 
---
ARCANITE REAPER HOOOOOOOOOO
---
Just ignore that guy man, you're getting heated over a moron. 
---
So, you confirmed what I said twice while you were offended? Is this a weird attempt at trolling?
---
sharding is simply put needed for the launch and saying it is not a classic experiance is kinda false a majority of people didn't start playing on launch so the need to form a line inorder to kill a mob is not a experiance most people had.
---
WITH THAT SAID. blizzard still needs to properly define and limit the sharding. a mix of heavy shards, server que times and respawn timer mixing for a set ammount of time and only in the starting zones should remove this starting bump and get people going.
---
we need to know this so we can know what kind of experiance we are going to get.
---
For people that didn't look at what they're rolling on?  How redundant do we have to make everything.  "Are you sure you want to loot this corpse?" 
---
Here's the thing. There is no such thing as 'Vanilla Wow'. It was always a continuum of constantly changing values/ loot and encounters.
---
The way things ended in 1.12 was simply a stepping stone in the development of WoW. Almost immediately, Blizzard abandoned many of the design mistakes that dogged them throughout classic.
---
I'm not sure why people want them to be locked into a design that was horrifically imbalanced and unfun for most of the classes.
---
For me, it's funny that #nochances even exists. Because literally no one wants that. It's also completely impossible as a concept.
---
At most what that philosophy represents is a desire to live out a past that is entirely dead and gone. For example, at one point in Beta development Paladins had crusader strike. Would it be a 'change' to give them that ability again?
---
I love how Osmansan laughed at Bladees roll.. Then rolls one. Perfect.
---
My faith in Blizzard as a whole isn't getting restored, that'll only happen when they design a great game/expansion again, but I do have a lot of faith in the Classic team itself, it already feels like it's so long since we've had such an open and responsive dev team.
---
Yo take a deep breath and let your eyes rest, the strain is clearly making you a massive c u n t 
---
I think this is the perfect result. Its balanced and doesn't require blizzard to hire more staff to deal with wider issues. 
---
Meth is a hell of a drug. 
---
I've literally never seen this happen, even though everyone and their mother talk like it's this common thing
---
Right, can't go soul link, siphon life which was possible in TBC, but soul link with drain life talents are still possible, and with nightfall make you hard to kill in 1v1
---
pressing w will move your character forward, are you sure you wish to do this?
---
God, warrior leveling sucked. I was still one of the first 10 people to hit 60 on my server, but it was awful.
---
Please dear God clear your notifications, I'm going to have a heart attack.

In glad to see these increasingly  frequent blue updates.

Not trying to be a dick buy why would anyone have any reason to believe otherwise?

Didn't you see the video of the rogue killing people naked with the worst dagger of the game? Eviscerate is independent from gear. Still takes some skill.

Leveling:
---
Do everything in your power to convince your wife to roll shaman heals because as a horde warrior you will fall in love with her windfury totem especially when tanking. The proc is super fun and will speed up leveling considerably once she can access it. As a former MT horde tank, I will miss it terribly when I roll alliance at classic launch.
---
The best leveling does not involve arms until level 40. Why? Look at the arms talent tree vs fury, right off the bat the first 5 points into cruelty for 5% crit is a massive dps increase in comparison to nearly anything in the arms tree for some time. Also, it applies to all weapons and while leveling you will not get to be choosy, the highest dps item you get will have to suffice. As horde, you will receive a blue staff (yes train staves) reward from wailing caverns, equip it even if it looks goofy because the dps on it is retarded and will carry you for a bit. Also, piercing howl in the fury tree has HUGE utility for both kiting and pvp. It can easily save your dungeon group in a pinch.
---
At 40, respec to arms to get mortal strike because now arms will beat fury moving forward all the way to level 60. Learn to charge and stance swap mid charge before your 1st hit on the mob to be at full rage for an immediate mortal strike. Things like this you will learn and speed up your leveling. Post-40, leveling is much more engaging/fun if you perfect your rotation and rage use for mortal strikes.
---
Tanking:
---
1-59 You need nothing but a 1H sword/shield to tank period. Never ever invite another warrior into your group since he will just take the gear that you are tanking hard at work to obtain. He can easily throw a shield on and do the same thing and form his own group. Be picky - you are the group leader.
---
60 If you want to tank the more difficult dungeons like Strat/Scholo/DM/LBRS/UBRS then you must be protection spec or your wife is going to feel the pain trying to keep you alive. DM is sort of dead issue since it won't be in phase one (thankfully) because the mobs in their hit very hard so hopefully you have geared yourself using the other dungeons.
---
Tips:
---
1. Communicate - you are the tank and the leader. 
---
2. Learn to hotkey raid targets and give assignments - Skull always dies 1st, X dies 2nd, Sheep/CC Moon. Correct the dps player that is not following the kill order and is splitting dps. It's inefficient by making the fight last longer, could pull aggro off you easily, and get himself or everyone killed.
---
3. Learn how to manage your rage. As you progress in vanilla, you will get a feel with how much threat you are generating per attack/ability and how it is holding up to people's damage. If a mob is about to die and you have two sunders on it and know you will keep aggro on it until it is dead, swap off it and start your attacks on another mob to maximize your rage efficiency. If no other targets alive, start pooling rage for the next pull using white hits and no abilities.
---
4. Pay attention to everything, literally. As someone has already mentioned, the pull is huge so time it accordingly. Also, The success rate is DIRECTLY proportionate to the healer's mana bar. Be patient and tell the dps to chill if they complain. Do not stress your healer. Slow and steady wins the race.
---
5. Use Macros. Your taunt resisted? Hit that battle stance + mocking blow macro to force it on you.
---
6. Get fucking pro. Ignore tanking that add because you are just rage building for when it gets pulled off you and you were just waiting for the dps/heals to pull so you could taunt get a free 10% threat off the person who pulled then rage dump into it. This will come with time. Mobs can run around, just don't let them hit anyone. Hamstring and let that fucker chase you if you know you have so much threat that nobody can pull off you and your healer needs a break.
---
7. Slow weapons are your friend especially with windfury. Stay away from fast weapons even when tanking unless it's just a big dps increase. Vael in BWL is the main exception to the rule due to mechanics of the fight.
---
8. Revenge &gt; Sunder always due to the rage cost of revenge (5) vs sunder (15) making it a hugely efficient TPS (threat per second).
---
So raid are still abusable. And they are the easiest one to abuse and profit, guess me and my friend will derail some pug like we did in wotlk then if they keep this, easy gold.
---
You have my bow.
---
I didn’t get this either. However, the first image result is the UD rogue.
---
Nope. My friend and I almost always do it.
---
The two are separate.
---
I've seen chrome bug out and use a previous websites logo. Sure it's not your client side?
---
You can't reserve the best loot because people won't join if you do.
---
But who cares, with loot trading you can go without reserving and make every guildies roll on those items so you get them with 90% success rate.
---
You might have convinced me to try Fury out while leveling.  Even if it would be silly using a staff :P 
---
I haven't done it but it's not that weird. I think it depends on your reasoning for doing so. If your reasoning is there are an excess of Orc males and Orc females look cool then no that's not weird.
---
I miss them olden days when people would compliment you on keeping an enemy CCed or making a smart pull or dropping some dope heals when shit went south.          
---
We went from complimenting people on playing well to linking a damage meter and pulling their dicks out wanting a standing ovation, be good to get back to the old ways.
---
Dailys? You saying do dailys for your vanilla guide? 
---
To expand on this, the overcrowding is the initial issue, and then the decline in population that one can expect over time, such that a stable population would require an initially well-over-capacity server to reach a healthy level thereafter.
---
Though really, I think they should have a throttle on how quickly the playerbase can climb, so there is less of a flash and more of a controlled burn as people join and servers can be added gradually.
---
I’ve never seen that. Got a link?
---
oh, we updated as we went along.
---
Hmm. That might be the case. Do you know what I can do to fix it?
---
Agree! Hate the speed-runs dungeons are now
---
Your not gonna learn anything on this subreddit bro
---
Retail is a cautionary tale of, "If you try to make everyone happy, then no one will be happy." Classic works because there's a mold. It has a distinct vision on what it should and shouldn't be. Retail is just a mess of ideas trying to make the same game for wildly different players. 
---
The issue is they don't want to pay for GMs.. hence the automation
---
Clear your cache and cookies and restart?
---
Eviscerate scales with attack power in 1.12 vanilla.
---
I would love to test out hoj + ironfoe + thrashblade + sword specialization talent with windfury on my rogue, might pull some interesting Numbers 😁
---
This reminds me of the rants of a mentally ill guildie I once had. I thought he was just super sarcastic and funny until I eventually realized that he wasn’t messing around, but actually spent most of his waking life in writing nonsensical posts on the internet (he showed me links to forums he frequented, where his post count was in the hundreds of thousands). A lot of the time he was just incoherent. Looking back, I wish I would have helped him somehow.
---
Sad.

Great job blizzard, I regain my hope with ur company. Can't wait for Vanilla and it's gonna be great!
---
The only reason I realised was when I changed my bar addon, it used to be a great trick for interrupting people drinking in arenas.
---
Ah yeah that rings a bell. 
---
Early fury was not fun in PvP. AQ40+ was better. Arms /MS Spamstring+Windfury+Swordspec+multihit talent with whirlwind = destroy everyone in close proximity in less than a second. It was equally ridiculous and amazing destroying an entire team with a pocket shaman.
---
It's not weird, everyone does it.
---
If you start cat fishing people though, that's weird.
---
Goldshire is Azeroth's ERP capital.
---
Im sorry but you are wrong. There are many real incentives to world pvp. Devilsaur Leather, Black Lotus , Silithus Lords, Rich Thorium, elemental invasion and other limited resources in the wprld lead to wprld pvp in some form.
---
If only BfA had such an amazing feedback from the devs as Classic has.
---
I just bounce, I'll say something before I even start walking my way there like "Hey, Master Looters on." If they dont say anything or switch it off I just start looking for another group, I know for DPS this was a pain because sometimes it took a while to get a group formed but I'd rather wait an hour for a fun friendly fair group then wait 10 secs for a shitty group... This is weirdly my entire argument for choosing Classic over Retail.
---
Because Classic is made by Team A.
---
Super weird, just like playing a nelf when you’re actually a human.
---
EU, NA, alliance, horde?
---
Kids these days... *sigh*

S6 rogue offhand, thunderfury is better

Trying it right now, thank you for your help.

Idk. Server black lists were a thing. I remember when someone would call lfg, only to be called out by a dozen people for being a ninja. It’s a thing. 
---
Yea for me I want more like a Classic skelleton as a base. Then I want stuff governed by a "classic constitution." Rather then a snow globe but I can live with the snow globe. After all it's one hell of a snow globe.
---
wut
---
Thank you for listening and answering!
---
 If only classic came 5 years sooner. Life and responsibilities have out grown my free time to game sadly. God I loved the time dump/grind of vanilla.
---
I started playing on EU-Sporeggar i WotLK. I'm actually belong to Group A, I never RPed, but I respect people who does RP and overall I think that this thing that led people to RP server is some kind of selection. People there were just more kind and tolerable. I liked it a lot.
---
And no, it wasn't 90-10 Alliance. It was something like 30-70 Horde. Was good enough for me anyway, I had some world PvP and it was enough for me.
---

LETSGOBOIIIIIIIIIII
---
Heh, good luck, this is the world of people being perpetually butt hurt.  No matter what they say or do someone is gonna cry like a small child.
---
It's not though.  They both need and can use it, and they both put forth the effort to get it.  Why can't they decide which of the two of them gets it IF the two of them win in the first place?  Plus, like I said, if they put forth 2/5ths of the effort, then why can't they weight the RNG 2/5ths in their favor?  That's MORE fair than pure RNG because it gives some value to effort.
---
In your example four people put forth the effort to put together a run and run it.  They filled with one person that didn't do anything extra.  Why wouldn't they get 80% of the say while that person gets 20% of the say?  Further, as you say, very few people are going to bother with that when they can just reserve what they want giving the pug ZERO chance at the item.
---
FWIW, I've played on live with these rules...very, very extensively, and this just wasn't something that happened or caused issues very often.  More often than you ran into issues like this, you ran into people begging/harassing you to sell/give them the drop that you just won.
---
Not debating that. What I'm saying is that they weren't really a thing for 5-man dungeons. 
---
I was totally in the same boat as you. Always played make being a male IRL. But I play a Female NE Hunter now. Enjoy the weapon animations and the character looks kickass in armor. 
---
Don’t worry about what others think. Try new things
---
Seems like a decent compromise, since most raids will be run with guilds where trust factor is high, so abusing the system wont be as much of an issue.
---
I agree with your points here and would even suggest opening up the free trial to level 20 like it was around the start of TBC.

I didn't say world PvP was pointless. What you're describing is the practical, necessary part of world PvP, and this will always exist. In fact, that and getting ganked ARE world PvP end game. What I want is FUN world PvP, where an objective ISN'T the reason to engage in it. Where you just want kill the enemy faction because it's fun and interesting. It's in this area where I think blizzard messed up and I understand why they did.
---
To make PvP worth something, they had to actually make PvP a part of the game (world of warcraft had never been a PvP MMO, at least when compared to true PvP MMOs like guild wars and DAoC). They did this by giving us battlegrounds, but to make them work, they needed to make rules and mechanics for PvP. And in so doing, fun, interesting, compelling world PvP died. Now, as you mentioned, we do world PvP, not because we really really enjoy it, but because we need to kill the guy that is taking our black lotus spawn. 
---
By instituting honorable kills and changing the way players can effect each other, based on level difference, world PvP became a shell of what it once was.

I would rez and attack them until they get fed up of chain killing me. I never found someone more stubborn than me (or maybe they had less free time than me :D ).

Frankly I don't have the time for this shit nowadays. This is why I will roll on a PVE server.

Agree. When people do that it only delegitimizes what they are trying to say.

Yeah that gate, I always wondered what was going to be behind that damn gate, and in the end it came to nothing.

You can control fear with CoR. If a mob looks like it's being feared into a bad spot drop CoR on it and it will still have the fear effect, but become immune. Once it gets close to you just switch the curse to anything else and it becomes feared again. 
---
That is a proper challenge. Take a one week vacation, stack up on coffee and energy drinks and let it rip. If the servers can take it (doubt) doing an early push right at the beggining will pay off since no one will be taking away your quest targets to make you wait for respawns. 
---
Can someone explain how this would have been a problem at all? If I remember correctly, and I probably don't, 5 man loot was personal loot for bosses right? So how does it hurt anyone at all if other people give there loot to someone else and not you. Either way you do it, loot trading or not, you still wouldn't get the piece right?
---
You mean on private servers? That's because it's a single server with a global population.
---
Classic will almost certainly have battlegroups, which will mean much more active twink brackets.
---
I'd like that as well, but ye know, gotta be a tad realistic.
---
People ganking or people ganking gankers? It REALLY depends on the guild and how close people are.
---
Right, but if someone is anticipating playing tennis, I'm not going to suggest they play ping pong. It's better to look at it completely differently, and know that the two only have some very few backbone similarities
---
If a hunter doesn’t get the first legendary in the game the system is obviously broken. 
---
I want to point out that this is great for guilds. Instead of having Loot Council/DKP bids over an item with the leader missing trash to loot, he can now loot everything and distribute the gear via trade as the raid progresses, with no extra downtime :)
---
I mean... the trick here is to show that 
---
2 specials (+2 free hit procs) from a slow weapon - 
---
2 specials (+2 free hit procs) from a fast weapon
---
is better than 10 HS damage bonuses.
---
You're just restating the old "WF is better for slow weapons". Which it is.  But is the difference enough to make slow weapons better even considering HS spam.
---
This is so obviously correct for those of us with experience at progression raiding that there isn't even really a debate. That's why I'd like to see buffs, because meme classes like Warlock and Hunter are really inferior. I mean taking one or two on your raid makes sense, but why not bring a real DPS class like Warrior?
---
This card was backed by First National Bank of Omaha,  where I currently work as a banker!!
---
Even on retail I was able to sap max levels fairly regularly on my 19/29 rogue when trying for the arena trinket.
---
I have been in two loot council guilds for a long time. The first one I was an outsider raidlogging. The other guild I worked really god damn hard to earn a reputation. nost servers have strange guild dynamics because there is always another person to fill that raid slot. but on a more regular pop server, the guild is committing to the player to get them geared/attuned. If there is not those people working to help out other players than there is nobody to fill that raid slot. Without people helping others, the guild ceases to function. I had no problem getting passed over for loot as a raid  logger because i was just filling a slot, not making the guild function.
---
Okay let's build a new pally spec called noitubirter and it can be the pally's first damage spec
---
Well I agree with you and said as much on the show. My experience playing Vanilla was 30+ minute queues, sometimes taking over an hour. When Crossrealm happened, I got instant pops. When the comparison is between 5-6 games vs 1 game, I absolutely prefer to the 5-6.
---
I hope Blizzard does some sort of dynamic queue. So if your side has a healthy enough pop that you get sub 5minute queues, then it's server only. But as soon as it starts getting longer than that, then it throws you into a cross-realm queue so you can get a game instantly. 
---
I think the underlying factor is the knowledge that what brought us to the crap show that is BFA was Blizzard catering almost solely to the casual style. Making content consistently easier, taking away nearly all time commitments, removing the need to socialize by giving one click raids, handing out purple rewards like candy thus diminishing their value. 
---
I know its just a pipe dream but i would love classic to be a reboot, to see Blizz release new content (possibly new xpacks) but follow the classic design elements, keep the social and harder core elements.
---
By the way, all of this comes from someone who was only medium-core at best... but seeing people walking around decked out in all purples gave me something to aspire to, something to work towards, even if i never made it, it made the journey more interesting.
---
Live has changed how loot trading worked compared to how it was first implemented. In wotlk it was very common to do what I said, before needing BoPs made them untradeable.
---
And the part you missed is how one of the two DIDN'T need the piece, they just pretended they did in order to help their friend.
---
You're also ignoring how they are doing it behind the backs of the other players. If they were upfront about their intentions from the start, then there's no issue. People who had a problem with them trying for loot that way would not waste time with their group. Instead, you're tricking players into using their labor for no reward, because you don't intend to give them a fair shot at one.
---
You can say "oh they're 4/5 of the group so them getting 4/5 of the chance is fair" but it's not. Fair would be their one guy who needs it rolling against the one pug who needs it. Not 4 people rolling for 1 person, meaning that person has 4x the odds.
---
Maybe they should just remove the onus of loot. Make it so everyone has a 20% chance of getting a random piece off every boss that only they can loot. Call it 'personal loot'.
---
Right click report would be fine if none of the consequences were automated. People getting squelched or temp banned because a group of people reported them isn't cool.

---
/s me too though this is looking better and better each announcement
---
Seems like your friend lost his mind. It was probably the lizard people with their psychotronic mind control devices.
---
The weird thing is none of the casual players I know do this. They just play and have fun. They don't care about hardcore players in the sense that they don't compare themselves to them. They find hardcore players cool and make money of them by farming/crafting stuff that raiders need.
---
My suspicion is that it isn't actual casual players who do this. It is people who want the nice loot but don't want to grind consumables, respec and show up on time every week. Basically they don't put the guild first so they get told off by people who do and then they whine on the forums.
---
Now *that* is hypocritical!
---
Yeah.  I'm just not sure playing to level 5 is long enough to convince someone that the game is worth continuing, especially if they are the type to write it off due to graphics to begin with.  I don't think the game really gets it's hooks in someone until ~15+
---
&gt; "you don't seriously think there are so few nodes in the world that the server can't support an increase in population?"
---
You didn't understand me at all. I think that the majority wont farm their own mats and rush to endgame. This would make demand higher than supply. Higher prices. It could also go the other way where the majority will farm mats, then not have enough buyers because everyone is farming their own shit. Then the price plummets. It just depends on the players. Either extreme is very bad.
---
&gt; when it's been proven that isn't the case
---
Source? I've heard from many private server go-ers that they hate the larger pop servers. One guy I recall said towards the end of Nost they raised the cap to 15k, he would log in then go out for a few hours and come back to still being in queue.
---
Vanilla had a soft cap of 3.5k. It's made for that. It's *designed* around that. Anything more is far, *far* more detrimental to the true experience than a week or two of sharding.
---
This is all completely moot, by the way. If you don't want sharding for the fear of Blizzard saying sharding will be needed later, then you can't seriously believe larger servers would be a good solution. There's a greater chance of Blizzard bringing in sharding in that case because of the server load at peak times. And the capability of sharding will already be in the client, and we know that. It's always going to be a flip of the switch away.
---
it was my understanding that you just need to pay the $15/month to play classic, or anything short of bfa
---
the $60 is just for the people who want to play the latest version of retail
---
You can always do world PvP if you really really enjoy it. People gank Redridge/stonetalon, people raid Ironforge, people run around killing people in BRM or Burning Steppes, don't even get me started on STV.  
---
You want people to do something purely for the fun of it, but are also saying that they won't do it because BG rewards are too good. So when they world PvP for a reward that isn't honor, that isn't "truly for fun" world PvP as you describe? But yet the problem is that the honor rewards aren't worth it?  It doesn't really add up.   
---
Also, people go to ungoro just for fun. The devilsaur is kinda just a means to world PvP for them. Not everyone there is there for the $$$.  
---
Go look at the retail sub. It seems dead. 
---
Not weird at all it's a game play what you want

this is a great clarification

The company has wayyyyy more work to do to restore my faith. Lets go with i am starting to believe that the team working on Classic could do post Naxx content and keep it in the spirit of the game instead of just going to TBC. 
---
&gt; when they design a great game/expansion again
---
And then proceed to ruin it like they've done to literally every franchise they've made
---
I wonder if people will learn from this the next time there is massive feamongering over a something people are only speculating Blizzard will do? Probably not.
---
Outstanding move
---
I'm sorry my semantics threw you off there. In this case, based on the context of the entire post, I basically defined world PvP as the purposeful engaging/attacking of the enemy faction for no other reason except that's it's fun and exciting. In your example above, it seems that your view of world PvP is a byproduct or runs secondary to your primary objective, that is, collecting resources. In your example, world PvP has a place and, arguably, a good place. But I would argue that it would be nice to have both and that world PvP doesn't have to be a means to an end but a means on its own. 
---
Super weird dude, are you gay or smth?
---
Server load is only an issue if the hardware cant handle it. In this day and age, it definitely can.
---
Frankly I think the actual solution is have people tough it out. Queues happen on live launches anyways. As for quest mob issues, go to a less popular zone like Mulgore. It won't be long before things are normal again anyways.
---
Sharding may be only a flip of the switch either way, but precedence is huge for this kind of change, and I want to avoid that.
---
I'd rather deal with a larger community from a larger server than deal with Blizzard starting to shard everything.
---
Bad take. 
---
It’s not hard to get and can be done completely with a 5 man group of paladins to make for an epic adventure. 
---
Plus it literally carries you to 30 and then is still great 30-36 when you get bone biter. 
---
You can't use both Expose Armor and Sunder Armor on one mob.
---
I can see the headlines now!  Epic molten core raid cut tragically short as 40 people have sudden heart attacks brought on by exhaustion!
---
They also make your armor look better by comparison.
---
Ganking is the way to go. Any level equal or lower is getting attacked as I go.
---
I’m not going to camp you unless I had a reason to. But outside of that, no sympathy. 
---
I see.  I did not play in WOTLK or Cata at all, only the xpacs before and after (to varying degrees, I have the most experience in vanilla and legion), so that may be coloring my opinion on how this is going to play out.
---
I didn't miss the part about one of the two not needing the piece, I chose to ignore it as a major scenario, similar to you ignoring me stating they both DID need the piece as a major scenario.   We can sit here and concoct edge cases and scenarios with layers on layers of naunce all day and discuss which ones are ethical and which ones aren't.   However, I don't think that's as productive as talking about this in a broader sense because it's that broader sense that's going to be the determining factor on both whether or not this actually still goes in and what that impact will be on the community...not the specific edge cases
---
I absolutely do not disagree that a group should be upfront about it.  However, I do think it should be obvious that if you're going into a majority guild/friend run as a pug you should expect your needs and opinion to carry less weight.  That's just the way it works, and the way it has always worked basically everywhere.   I see it as similar to doing contract work for a company and expecting the same benefits as the permanent employees.....a very naive expectation.
---
I do think that this should also be considered: Odds are if you're 4/5 of the group you actually organized the group and run.   Those things have value also.  Basically all player created loot systems attempt to dampen the effect of RNG and increase/bring value to things like meta-level effort (attendance, farming guild mats, etc) and whom gets the most value out of the loot.
---
I think dudes who play girl characters are weird so I'm not the best guy for the answer you're looking for but I will say one think about the troll females.

---
" , I basically defined world PvP as the purposeful engaging/attacking of the enemy faction for no other reason except that's it's fun and exciting "  
---
How can world PvP be only incentivized by fun in your definition, but yet the problem is that there is no incentive? Are you saying that it is not fun to world PvP?
---
Casters get absolutely fucking shafted against higher level players compared to melee. If you get attacked by a red level player, you may as well just stand still and let them kill you.
---
My thread is primarily about evidence that PvP is broken at patch 1.12 and that, early in vanilla's history, it was functioning better. I wished to shed light on that and hoped to show people that the very first instance of PvP was actually superior then those found in the later patches. I further contend that we can, in fact, have both entertaining and exciting BGs AND entertaining and exciting world PvP. 
---
By preventing low level players from causing any harm to higher level players, that by itself caused irrefutable harm to world PvP and eventually led to a world of warcraft where PvP servers are no more (lots of things eventually contributed to that but this was the first).

5 players enter Blackrock Depths. Group makeup is a warrior (tank), a rogue, mage, warlock, and druid (healer). At the end of the dungeon, the epic mace Ironfoe drops. Ironfoe is a best in slot item up until Naxxramas.
---
The rogue rolls need on it. The druid is a friend of the warrior, and pretends he thinks its good for feral dps and thus rolls need on it. Potentially, the priest if friends with the warrior can take some social backlash and roll need as well. In fact, any party member can roll need on it as long as they accept the consequences socially. With four people rolling for Ironfoe, the rogue only has a 1/4 chance of winning it, while the warrior has his chances (1/4) combined with the (2/4) coming from either of his friends winning it. If they win, loot trading allows them to trade Ironfoe to him, as if he won it.
---
TLDR it's an absurdly easy system to exploit.
---
I disagree.  What percentage of people who played Vanilla for the first time on private servers quit before level 6? It's a very very small percentage, and the reason for that is because the first five levels were enough to convince almost everyone that this game is something special.  You're right in saying the point where someone's decision becomes more clear is during the later levels, but the first five levels alone have proven effective over the years. After all, if people didn't enjoy the game starting out, why would they continue? 
---
If they add more levels I'm completely down for that as long as gold caps for starter accounts remain in place, but I wouldn't foresee much of a difference in sub number growth. 
---
Everything i do is stuff that i have found and tested by myself.  With that being said some stuff is gonna look similar to other videos cuase it's simply the fastest way to do it.
---
Thanks for you efforts. Regarding your Phase 1 pre-BiS list - you have Flarecore Leggings which require Molten Core drops to craft (+ lots of TB rep for the recipe which is hard to get without MC drops), is that really pre-Raid? Also, do we have any confirmation that the 1.10 Class Quests will be in Phase 1, otherwise Soul Harvester will not be available for pre-BiS.

Are you sure you want to log in?

I think it's only 10-15 seconds. Probably 15.

You can see it in the Incredible Warrior Tricks video when he uses Skull on Impending Doom to break sheep. Eventually he becomes cc immune, and the mage eventually gets him resheeped for the full 15 second duration.

1. Nowdays - not much. Thanks to sharding, crossrealms and dungeon finder all server identity is currently gone.  Back during Vanilla times - A TON. People were active on forums to trade, look for groups, guilds, organizing and coordinating various events and raids on opposite faction cities. Over the course of few months you start recognizing most of the nicknames. After all you see them all the time in towns, trade chat, dungeons, farming mats, pvping, duelling. The same bunch of people every day. Most people know which tanks/healers are good and which ones to avoid unless no other option. Some people become memes for whatever weird shit they pulled off during dungeons/pvp. I suspect that Discord might be more popular now. Like realm discord or similar. We'll see.
---
2. Oh you will remember when shit gets stolen from you. You're gonna meet that guy countless of times again.  You're gonna see his name running around you in town, posting on trade chat and looking for groups. For the next couple of months. There will be blacklist on forum/discord I'm sure 100%. Also probably an internal one from your guild. There was one in mine.

You linked nothing.
---
"after you have introduced yourself to us as a ninjalooter." 
---
The thing is you won't even notice because i will be rolling on an item i seem to need (will keep my pre raid bis to equip it during the raid instead of my raid gear) and give it to my friend once the raid is over and everyone else left.
---
i think I will have to check that zone out when I activate my account. i think Blizz uograded me to one of the no-name expansions that came out after Wrath
---
Hah, going "no bad" isn't productive, so I'd rather actually talk about things.
---
While your case is possible, if both players need the item theres much less chance of any loot trading actually happening. Generally if both need the item in a dungeon (raids are a different beast altogether), they'll just be like "if either of us gets it, sweet" rather than "okay I get the item either way". So your scenario is an edge case, while mine was a very frequent occurence in WoTLK. The change happened after Cata but I dont remember loot trading happening much during Cata, but at the same time I had stopped right before 4.2 so I missed out on the launch of LFR where apparently it was very common as well.
---
The flipside to the "4/5 made the group" is that the dungeon run wouldnt be possible without that 5th person. If it was, the group of 4 would have just gone as 4 to guarantee loot. But since the 5th enables the dungeon to be possible, they should at least get their fair chance of receiving loot.
---
If I knew of the pop of a server, I would always pick the minority faction.
---
It is miserable having 30-60 min pvp queues. Being a minority in world pvp was only an issue while leveling in a few zones and when I’m running into a raid. 
---
Fully agree and it isn't even just the top end materials you mentioned. There is also open PvP for a large number of other, mid- to high-level materials and farm spots that are sought out by medium level characters and 60s alike. Such as mid-level herbs and ores and crafting material drops which are required by consumables regularly in the endgame.
---
Basically your endgame farming starts between level 30 and 40. But that is even *more* reason why OP is kind of right about this. Open PvP in a 5 level range is challenging and fun, but it becomes incredibly unfair if the range is bigger. I personally learned my way around that, but it would be simply more fun and dynamic if this were not the case.
---
Also contrary to popular belief, open pvp is very *rarely* a 60 ganking lowbies for no reason. 90% of the time (estimation) a higher level player will just leave "lowbies" alone when there is no reason to. A much higher level character is always safe against a lower level one and doesn't need to strike first to assure his safety. Open pvp happens mostly either in that ~5 level range and/or when contesting a farm spot.

Doubtful blizz would do that but it is a good idea. If it was made clear beforehand that misusing the report system carried a ban and they actually banned for it each and every time it would go a long way to stopping that abuse.

It's not weird. I've had female characters usually for casting/attack animations, but I generally have a male as my main. Usually I hear people use females for casters and males for everything else, but it's really all about what you want.

Yea I can agree with the premise of the post that it would be nice to have a shot against players much higher level than you. 
---
However, this whole expansion about how World PvP is completely fucked in 1.12 is just wrong. Yea maybe you won't be able to kill a lvl 60 when you are lvl 40 no matter how hard you try but you will get plenty of world PvP against players your own level.

So [THIS](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b3zeat/seriousquit_getting_upset_with_every_decision/) topic having 200 upvotes is pretty pathetic. If this guy got his way, Loot Trading in dungeons would still be a thing, because we should all just shut up and be happy with whatever we get, instead of giving feedback...
---
I don't get who is upvoting posts like this.
---
I agree. I thought this was worse than Loot Trading, which always seemed somewhat neutral to me
---
It depends on how you'd define "world PvP". If it's simply: engaging with the enemy faction outside a BG, then yes, in that sense, it's mostly not fun. It is fun for the first 3-4 months of a server but after that, the only world PvP you "engage in" is being instant killed by a high level or fighting over a node. Now, while fighting over a node, as incredibly captivating as that sounds, can be enjoyable, I don't think it's what most people think of when they think "world PvP". Most probably think of massive battles in STV and Tanaris, skirmishes in Southshore/Tarren Mill. 
---
Let's keep it simple. Ask yourself, when you were max level or close to it, when was the last time you went looking for world PvP or attempted to organize it? The reasons we do things in this game are mostly because they are necessary (farming, power leveling, running guild mates through an instance for the hundredth time, etc.) or because it's fun (fishing &lt;that's me, I love fishing&gt;, BGs, fun instances, raids, etc.) and ideally it's both. World PvP was at one time both. It was fun and, in many cases, necessary. Now, it's 99% of the time necessary and rarely fun. 
---
This had less to do with you and I but mostly because blizzard, through bad decisions, made world PvP not only non-interesting, but somewhat pointless since you can gain honor so much easier through BGs and because in BGs, you were only paired with people of your same level and can actually engage with them. By bringing back the original way PvP was setup, this would allow more players to engage in it and bring it back, if not totally, to a much larger extent then it is now.

If he don't call me out, nobody will know. (That's what happen most of the time, if he really want the item badly he will just spend the gold he have).
---
If he call you out, you either say you were trying to help him or say he lie or something like that, nobody will know who is right unless it happen too often (just trade it to your friend to have him sell it on the next raid).
---
I did this for 6 months while wrath was live with my guild, never got caught (though it got close one time) and i had enough gold to do whatever i wanted.
---
&gt; Generally if both need the item in a dungeon (raids are a different beast altogether), they'll just be like "if either of us gets it, sweet" rather than "okay I get the item either way
---
On this point, I'll have to disagree *somewhat*.   The reason being, my wife and I actually do this quite a bit.  If we both need a piece of loot, we'll decide who gets the most use out of it and give it to that person first.   We will only do this for items we *both* actually need and can use, though, and we will make it clear what is going on.
---
Your last point is something that worries me about loot trading, not so much for myself but for the community as a whole.   I think both viewpoints on the 4/5s vs 1/5s thing do actually have merit (just preferring my viewpoint obviously), but I believe that the end result of it either way is less pugs willing to join majority guild groups and less guild groups even wanting to deal with the hassle of a pug meaning less successful dungeon runs happening overall.

Hmm, didn't decide yet, still struggling to choose which class i want to play.  If you really want to avoid me, play horde since i will most likely play alliance ;)
---
Which part of itemization are you worried about? They stated things like titanic leggings won't be available until naxxramas.  Do you mean stuff like seal of wrynn?
---
You’re a garbage person. 
---
Easy solution: don’t pug raids
---
You are not. It takes almost 5 days played to get to 60 (i think is like 4 days 20 hours at the "fastest") Which leaves you with 52 hours at the "fastest" to get gear, consumables and to get all the required rep and quest lines done to have aqual quintessence to summon Rag ASSUMING you do zero sleep. You need 9000 rep from neutral to honored for the Hydraxian Waterlords and can't kill Shazz, Lucy, Gehennas, or Sulfuron before then because you need to kill them for the questline. Which leaves you with the ability to kill Mag(unlikey because of Lucy patrolling), Garr, Baron, and Golemagg for 450 rep. Even if you kill those bosses you will still need near 4 full trash runs of the raid (3rd should put you at 7950/9000 if you kill the bosses).  This is also assuming it launches an a Tuesday to give you a full reset and they don't have "extended maintenance" removing more hours.
---
If we go by your 18 hours a day estimate... you don't make it. At 18 hours a day you have 126 hours to do all that. If you hit perfect speed (unlikey) you will spend 116 of those hours just leveling to 60. That leaves you with only 10 hours to have good enough gear and consumables and the rep to do MC full.
---
Congratulations. You have written down how to be a piece of shit. 
---
This means beta soon.. doesn’t it?
---
Fully agree! Especially if you are a grind-type leveler you have many face-offs with levelers of the opposing faction, because you need to mark your territory first. If you win, you get to farm and if you lose, you have to find another place or kill some time. This dynamic is one of the major things that excites me about WoW.
---
Servers "bigger" have nothing to do with the sharding problem, nor with actual Vanilla.
---
Private servers player cap is nothing like it used to be in vanilla, please stop demanding it. Player cap should be Vanilla-like, what the world was designed for. A.k.a. \#nochanges
---
I don't want to kill a level 60 while I'm 40. I recognize my chances of making it out of there alive are low. But, by setting up the mechanics so that my chances of survival are 1%, this makes the situation far more frustrating then it should be. If I even had a 25% chance of CCing the attacker and escaping then, what was once a fairly dull and non entertaining situation becomes the opposite, for both me and my attacker. Me for escaping and the attacker because I wriggled away and now he's on the hunt. Far more interesting!
---
As for world PvP at end game.... even in vanilla wow when both horde and alliance are queuing up for MC, guild leaders on both sides would tell the players to not engage in PvP with threat of being kicked out of the group. Once you are max level, when you have an objective to accomplish, both sides informally agree on a truce. That said, I wouldn't walk up alone to 40 enemy players but that's not really world PvP... that's suicide. Lol. 
---
You realise they only changed this because of the massive outcry, right?
---
Their original plan was Loot Trading in all dungeons and raids.
---
What are you even talking about? I don't see that at all, I see feedback from people that want an authentic vanilla experience in Classic. And the devs are listening, just look at all the recent updates from the classic team over the past few days. If you're gonna call people out for being "toxic" at least give examples 
---
This article is a bit dated, but if anything that makes it even more relevant to discussing Classic WoW, as the figures were from pre-Cata.
---
https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/blizzard-70-percent-of-new-wow-players-dont-get-past-level-10_1
---
Key point here at the very start:
---
&gt; Blizzard has revealed that only 30 per cent of new World of Warcraft players make it past level 10.  That's the tipping point at which people either stay or go, which make's the game's 11.5 million subscriber base all the more impressive.

Whatever you think about the topic for me that sounds like blizzard actually want to do a good classic wow and not only a quick cash grab which I feared. They are listening and especially they argumenting why they make certain decisions. My hopes are up :)
---
Agreed, a male Orc Shaman in cloth looks totally cooler than one in a dungeon 1 set. Oh wait...
---
Nothing has the dungeon utility of a mage but locks aren’t bad depending on mob type.
---
For me as well. The Classic team is satisfying my nostalgic sustenance not only by giving Classic, but also being like Blizzard used to be. WoW Classic will literally be the first Blizzard game that I'll touch again in eight and a half goddamn years (okay, I did the Classic demo, but that doesn't count).
---
My fear is that it won’t feel like a new game and that everyone that plays will be experienced. I miss all the noobs from the Christmas free trial or 05/06
---
OP ran out of his anti-psychotic meds
---
I think it would be a constant staffing issue. There needs to be someone there 24/7 to deal with griefers and people who have rolled names like Krankenballs, probably several per server because with 2500 people running around there will be lots of shenanigans. So if you lowball that cost at $100k per year, someone needs to show that *at least* 600 or so people who would not have subscribed without an RP-PvP server will subscribe and stay subscribed for an RP-PvP server for it to be profitable.
---
Human nature being what it is I think you'll get a lot more reports from an RP-PvP server because every time someone gets ganked they will be scrutinising their ganker for something to report.
---
That is my guess at the maths, but it seems like a good guess to me.
---
Be aware that it can still happen in your guild hosted raid if you need to get some outside people to fill the empty slot.
---
It almost happen on us, a rival guild joined our raid (we needed like 7 people) and those 7 tried to roll on everything to give to their friend. Thankfully they weren't smart and we quickly saw that a mage needing on plate didn't make sense.
---
Arms is realistically the only viable spec. Warriors suck at 1v1, is okay in battlegrounds and is best class in the game if you're geared with healbots.  
---
Every class can kite you to death except paladins.
---
Hi, /u/killpro
---
Hypocrite flower: I can't wait for WoW Classic because retail has is catering to casuals.
---
Hypocrite flower: f\*ck all these hardcore players; you should just enjoy the game \[which only casuals can\].
---
God, if I remember correctly, there actually was a time where tab-targetting worked differently, and they reworked it (afaik it was because bots would use it to great effect) to be more random or use a different logic to establish which mob should be the next target.
---
I do hope they bring back the "old way", because that nerf remains annoying to this day.
---
See, this is what I mean
---
That is one of the items listed if you make a copy of the sheet you will see dropdown menus with alternatives.
---
I do not know if the quest will be in, its a guess on my side but also for that there are alternatives listed if you make an copy.
---
I see him [too](https://i.gyazo.com/735a61d2c9560a7c41c469a93dbba831.png).
---
May I ask why you prefer the *lack* of an easier, quicker way to report bad actors if the punishment system is not automated?
---
Please don't respond with just #nochanges, as that really isn't relevant to this.  This isn't in any way actual in game content or gameplay related, this is no different than bnet integration in terms of the *type* of change it is.
---
I'm interested in how they release new content for servers that open *after* launch.  Do they follow a separate 6 patch cycle or will they be accelerated to fall inline with the starting servers?
---
I think it’s weird , everyone defends it .... I’ve never wanted to be any other gender , so why play as one?
---
Also everyone saying you can’t be an orc irl either , yeah cause they don’t exist . Male and female genders do exist. IM NOT telling you not to do it. Personally tho i find it weird 
---
For the people, by the people
---
Which is a system that requires *even more* direct GM action because dealing with false reports isn't something that can be automated because a GM will have to determine it was false in the first place.  On top of that we have examples of people group reporting someone for lulz or because their streamer told them to (iirc asmongold? ran an experiment on it? i could have the wrong streamer), said person getting squelched or silenced, and no punishment forthcoming for the reporters.
---
If it's going to require GM intervention either way, why not just shortcut it and have GMs be the *initial* decision makers rather than the decision *revisers*
---
What’s with all these shitty comments?
---
Actually very fast, anything under 2 hours for 1-10 is an impressive goal. Though probably not reasonable for a fresh Classic launch. 
---
Curse of Weakness. Is it used much in raids? I know it shares a debuff slot with (Imp) Demo Shout and has roughly the same overall effect, so it does not really matter whether it's warriors or warlocks that maintain this debuff on bosses. Just wondering if it's worth putting some of the SM/Ruin filler points into Imp CoW or whether the points could be put to better use in other talents instead.
---
Keep it on master looter if that’s happening. Always keep the trusted raid leader in control of the loot, regardless of how the loot is being distributed. 
---
You can get to 60 in more or less 3 days on private servers, even though some quests give more exp than intended, the difference is not 2 days, you also don't even need to be level 60 to enter molten core, and all the bosses are easily killable in full greens.  
---
Only 1 person needs hydraxian rep so that person will just grind it while everyone else is leveling up.
---
Assuming the first reset of classic lasts 7 days like a normal reset you will see several ragnaros kills the first week.
---
I'd always get invited by this one chinese farmer, an orc hunter, to reset his Mara. I'd oblige every single day - it felt good to be a part of the great machine. 
---
Catform quest, Call of Air, friggen ANYTHING to give mages more depth. 
---
well it should be. It is lead by jeff kaplan after all.
---
Did you mean the other way around?
---
If I rolled on a PvE server I would be super pissed off if I got moved onto a PvP server.
---
Nooooooope
---
that's not toxic, it's a joke
---
stop being a little bitch
---
Haha. Dude was just trying to get by I'm sure.
---
Fair, but also, if you are spending 8 hours trying to get Felix's toolbox, you are wasting time.
---
The *real* underlying factor that so many people on here encourage casualism, is because many of those have grown up and gotten kids or long jobs, and know they can't be hardcore anymore like they used to in Vanilla. So they feel the need to go around and tell everyone to just be casual like them, because they can't accept the fact that not everyone has gotten or chose the same life as them, but can afford to be hardcore.
---
To the Vanilla generation: this is what you're signing up for. You know full well that Vanilla was very rewarding to the hardcore niche, and that casuals get left out on a lot of stuff, because that was how the game was designed back then, and Classic will be the same.
---
Lol what about real money? That’s why you went to school isn’t it. 
---
I was going to add that to my post but I wasn't sure if people knew he was the game director back then haha
---
I thoroughly enjoyed farming the elite satyr's in DM:E for felcloth / demonic runes/ pristine black diamonds and many other goodies. I could kill up to a pack of four by startign with enslave demon, banish, fear and nuke the last one while the enslavement tanks. Although it takes decent gear, it was stimulating and efficient. It worked well on Nostalrius as the fear pathing was predictable. It'd still have those heartbeat resists, but the fear would travel in the direction I feared it, or it would stand still feared. When characters were restored on Lightbringer, the fear behaved in a different way. Sometimes the fear would cause them to run through and behind me, run straight longer than usual and they would pull other mobs. It caused a lot more deaths and made this method a real pain in the ass
---
**TLDR: Does anyone know how fear pathing is supposed to / will work in classic wow? IME private servers have had two different results.** 
---
What did people have against multiple bars back then ?
---
Any version they release of AV is going to be a zergfest, because the objective is to play pve faster than the other team, no matter how hard you make the npc's it will be zergfest. Unoess you want to force PvP but that would go decidedly against kochanges soo..
---
I always play as a female even though I'm a male.  If I am going to be looking at something's backside for hours on end it's gonna be a female.
---
Do lists like this exist for other classes?
---
Man, I had no clue about that figure, that's incredibly interesting to think about. However, there are factors we have to take into account. I'd say the biggest of the bunch being social persuasion (whether directly or indirectly) through content creators and other online influences, combined with the fact that the current gaming marketing climate is entered around word of mouth advertising entirely.
---
Sure, the game's price will make it hard to compete with free titles, but when the top Fortnite streamers, Apex streamers, variety streamers, etc start all gravitating towards Classic WoW for a few months, those 140 million  monthly unique viewers Twitch pulls in are going to take notice.
---
Definitely is a factor to consider though.
---
First time I ever saw wow was watching at my friends house, his little brother was playing a dwarf hunter. dead on the beach of stv sitting as a ghost, waiting for the guy who ganked him to get low on mana so my he could rez and gank him back. That will always be the heart and soul of WARcraft to me. The war.
---
Being able to rez behind a tree and hold spacebar to fly 15 feet up and become invincible is the worst thing I can imagine for the health of world pvp and creating real danger in a contested warzone.
---
I too secretly hope this leads to a reboot of sorts of the WoW franchise.  Essentially ret-con everything and make it better.  Release Burning Crusade again but maybe redesigned so flying isn't needed (it could happen, use teleporters, jump pads, bridges instead?) and keep the philosophies that made WoW Vanilla great.  Keep the need for socializing, keep the difficulty, keep the amount of time it takes to level up with no convenience or level up boosts.
---
Maybe never going to happen.  A random adventurer can dream though, a random adventurer can dream..
---
I find that the dots in "oh shit" pulls save from wipes often. In a stable group I cannot quite top the damage chart but when you get a couple of those close call pulls you get way ahead in damage compared to anyone.
---
Curse of Weakness isnt used during any content. I remember seeing it once on Chrom and raid leader saying to take it off as it removed demo shout. In naxx progression you can use those points in Imp curse of exhaustion as that is extremely useful to slow  the Anub adds that spawn at 40% on KT, they wreck tanks if they catch up to them.
---
I'd really want one.
---
In Blizzard. Def not Activision. And I hope they stay out of classic as much as possible. 
---
Is this a serious post lol 
---
Depending on how heavily implemented sharding will be in the early levels it could be reasonable
---
Pro tip right there.
---
reminds me of this time we did onyxia and my guild took a random druid from general chat to join us because we were a few men short (I play druid too) the t2 head drops and because this guy wasn't in our guild we weren't using dkp this run so we rolled for it. Dude rolls 99 and everyone whispers me telling me shit happens and that i'll get it the next run blabla, I say fuck it and roll anyway and I roll 100 :D the guildchat went crazy
---
There are addons in retail that fix that. I'm not really sure what the default behavior is now since I've just used those. The one used by console port is really solid, it puts a light highlight on the target it will tab to next and has some configuration of how it chooses the next target.
---
I debated doing this. I played Horde all the way up through WotLK. The first time I leveled an Alliance was during Cata because they offered a free upgrade to everyone's account and I gave the game a try. Part of me wants to go Alliance this time for both the nostalgia of the game, but also have a new experience. Another part of me doesn't want to play as Alliance scum. 
---
Yup 100%. It basically made it so world pvp only happened in the early to mid 60s. But then they had dailies making max level people go out in the world.... without any danger since they have an opt out button.....
---
If they had kept dailies and DIDNT have flying??? Man. That would have been killer.
---
you're playing an orcs and magic fantasy game broski
---
In real life, you can actually change your gender.
---
Casting fireballs on the other hand...
---
Says the guy that thinks blizzard is trolling the he community.
---
Restore faith... I don't think so. 
---
Last press conference... "we have no big titles coming out this year"... or something like that? 
---
It's great for us but the company itself don't care about Classic much, or at least the people running it. This might be the only reason why Classic is doing quite alright.
---
Faith... hmm... the only thing I have is but a slim hope that they will leave classic alone... other than that, I really don't expect any new solid titles. Looking at it's games for quite a while be it overwatch, heartstone or Hots, it's clear that monetization is the only thing that they care about rather than making solid games that will simply sell well. (something like a solid single player game)
---
My first dungeon was WC as a druid. I'm pretty sure I was supposed to be healing but I probably spent half the run in bear form. I have no idea how I didn't get kicked out (probably because the rest were noobs too). I can't imagine we even finished it but I don't remember.
---
True. Exaggeration on my part, but quests in vanilla were not designed for large condensed populations in general. Off the top of my head, wendigo mane quest, any of the kobold quests in elwynn, and many 8n the quests in the night of zone will be horrid for the first week. Once people get out of these zones and spread out or start leveling at different paces it will be a lot more bearable. But Classic would have an awful launch if the starting zones weren't sharded for the first few weeks. 
---
Just chiming in with ancedotal evidence, in vanilla I was definitely able to attack and kill skull level players as a hunter via kiting. I would get insta#rekt if I ever got caught, but it was entirely doable even as a level 30ish hunter to kill a level 60 keyboard turner without an excess of miss/resist/etc.
---
Definitely don’t ask this sub. Everyone here hates retail, but I’ll tell you, right now? The raids and dungeons are amazing. Rest of the game is shit but still worth playing if you never have . Community is still present IF you find an active guild. Classic is DEFINITELY more engaging and fun, but there’s plenty good stuff in retail still, the raid right now is just so good. Anyone ACTUALLY currently playing will tell you the raid is good . Nobody here on this sub will tell you that though, these people are extremely emotional over retail vs classic and my comment alone probably just caused a few aneurysms. 
---
Yeah the time wont be the same. But the route itself is as good as it gets. The only thing i might do different on a fresh release is the first 4 levels.
---
&gt;  In retail, everyone is at max level and WPVP is dead 
---
Not quite, there was a fairly good skirmish yesterday in Stormsong Valley during the Invasion. 
---
What killed the WPVP there was the server not handling the number of players. 
---
People who consider UBRS to be a "raid" BTFO
---
All the bosses are easily killable with most of the raid pre-60 in full greens? I mean... Is that true?. 
---
This is essentially a whole new revenue stream for them. Of course they're trying their best at making it as authentic as possible
---
Thanks for your first hand experience!
---
I did both in vanilla, but i have more fond memories of leveling my undead rogue with my brother than anything so im goin horde for the nostalgia.
---
I appreciate this post. +1
---
Makes sense
---
I hate to be that guy but first person to 10 means absolutely nothing. Its not even about first to 20. It comes down to playing consistently and with limited breaks.  
---
If you get level 10 and then log off for 8 hours to sleep, there will be people ahead of you.  I see a lot of 1-10 guides but really it would be much more interesting to see a 40-60 guide where the leveling takes place over several days, not 1 hour.
---
Because I'm able to deal with someone mean? Grow up, kiddo. 
---
And we had a high dps boomkin for a long time. Niche specs can be done. The same amount of effort in a different class will yield much higher numbers. All they really need is crusader strike at the bottom of the tree to post good numbers.
---
what exactly were you hoping for?
---
It is. You should see some of the ragtag groups that beat mc before anyone knew what they were doing. Id imagine its not so hard if you do know what youre doing.
---
binding main spam spell to 4 not E that is not very efficient
---
Yes, Blizzard helped pally's by adding Crusader strike right after 1.12
---
There are 2 teams making wow: main team A made MoP, Legion and is now making Classic. Second team B is smaller and made filler, rushed expansions like WoD and BfA.
